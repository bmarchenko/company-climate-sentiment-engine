## Sentiment Analysis of Articles for Climate Change.

**_Abstract_ - Climate change has started to have a profound economic impact. 
Consequently, investors are looking for new methods to assess the risk and opportunities that come with climate change and their investments. 
In this work we seek to understand how to create a short term signal that looks at Sentiment Analysis of Social Media generated articles.

We aim to build an automated service based on Machine Learning(ML) to determine the attitude and emotional reaction of a writer to an entity(company) with respect to Climate Change topic.**  


### Authors
This open source project is implemented by [**Bohdan Marchenko**](https://github.com/bmarchenko) as a Student Course Work for [**Projector Natural Lnaguage Processing  Course**](https://github.com/k-bx/prj-nlp). 
The project is requested and supported by [**CARBON DELTA**](https://www.carbon-delta.com/) GmbH. 

### Dataset
##### 1 Google Search Results
Google search results were scraped using [**Pattern**](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/pattern). The keywords are <Company name> "climate change". 
For each company were considered 100-150 first Google results links.
  
### Technical Details:
The service will be available via Web Interface or/and API. 
The codebase and a sample of training set will be available via [**Github.com**](https://github.com/bmarchenko/prj-nlp)

#### Input Data
1. Text of an article.
2. Name of entity that is an object of a sentiment. This will be a company name e.g. "BMW". 
These will be the biggest public companies, limited by 2,400 securities from [**MSCI ACWI INDEX**](https://www.msci.com/acwi)

#### Output Data
1. An estimate for the sentiment. How "good" or "bad" is the sentiment of the company towards climate change. 
Range is from -2 to +2; ("Strongly Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Positive", "Strongly Positive") 
2. Confidence level that this article is about given company, from 0 to 5
3. Confidence level that this is about Climate Change, from 0 to 5

### Stages

#### Training Set
In order to train ML algorythm a few thousands of articles will be collected and tagged manually by humans. The source of articles may be
  - [**Google search**](https://www.google.com)
 or
  - [**Reuters News Feed**](https://www.reuters.com/tools/rss) for automated scraping.
- [**Microworkers.com**](https://microworkers.com) service is to be used to collect and tag the articles.

#### Ideas: 
The service can work on the word frequency of certain key words.

#### Steps:
- Investigate potential data sources
- Create a training set (with all three parameters)
- Create automated methods to asses articles
- Use proper cross validation to test the  [various methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)), e.g. leave one out “LOOCC”.
