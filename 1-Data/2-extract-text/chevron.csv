supported <mark>Chevron</mark>s current By-Law regarding special meetings, and the Board continues to believe this By-Law is in the stockholders best interests and provides appropriate and reasonable limitations on the right to call special meetings.
In 2010, stockholders representing approximately 80 percent of <mark>Chevron</mark>s common stock outstanding approved an amendment to <mark>Chevron</mark>s By-Laws that permits stockholders owning 15 percent of <mark>Chevron</mark>s outstanding common stock
to call for special meetings. At <mark>Chevron</mark>s last five Annual Meetings, an average of 68 percent of votes cast opposed this stockholder proposal to reduce the threshold for calling special meetings to 10 percent. </P><P style=""margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:6pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:arial"" align=""justify"">Your Board continues to believe that <mark>Chevron</mark>s 15 percent threshold to call for a special meeting provides stockholders with
assurance that a reasonable number of stockholders consider a matter important enough to merit a special meeting. Preparing for and holding a special meeting, like the Annual Meeting, is time-consuming and expensive. The 15 percent threshold
helps avoid waste of Company and stockholder resources on addressing narrow or special interests. </P><P style=""margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:6pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:arial"" align=""justify"">In addition to a lower threshold,
the proposal would permit a special meeting without any appropriate and reasonable limitations. <mark>Chevron</mark>s By-Laws currently contain two important limitations. A special meeting cannot be called (i) if the Board has already called or will
call an Annual Meeting of stockholders for the same purpose specified in the special meeting request or (ii) if an annual or special meeting was held not more than 12 months before the request for a special meeting was received and included the
purpose specified in the special meeting request. Given the time and cost associated with special meetings, your Board believes that these are appropriate and reasonable limitations. Moreover, the issues raised by the proponents in support of this
proposal already are consistently discussed at <mark>Chevron</mark>s Annual Meetings. </P><P style=""margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:6pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:arial"" align=""justify"">Stockholders can be assured that their right to be
apprised of and vote on significant matters is protected not only by their existing right to call for special meetings and participate in <mark>Chevron</mark>s Annual Meetings, but also by state law and other regulations. <mark>Chevron</mark> is incorporated in
Delaware, which requires that major corporate actions, such as a merger or a sale of all or substantially all of <mark>Chevron</mark>s assets, be approved by stockholders. <mark>Chevron</mark> is also listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and the NYSE requires,
among other things, that listed companies obtain stockholder approval for equity compensation plans and significant issuances of equity securities to related parties and for when such issuances represent more than 20 percent of an issuers
voting power. </P><P style=""margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:6pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:arial"" align=""justify"">Finally, although the proposal purports to relate to special meetings, the supporting statement suggests that the
proposal is nothing more than a vehicle to discuss the Ecuador litigation and related actions against <mark>Chevron</mark>. The proponent implies that special meetings are an appropriate vehicle for pressuring the Company to succumb to the demands in the Ecuador
litigation and pay a judgment secured through fraud and deceit. Your Board believes that the Ecuador litigation is illegitimate and the product of fraud. In this regard, stockholders should be aware that as part of a nearly 500-page opinion issued
on March 4, 2014, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York summarized the courts factual findings as follows:

judge, first to use a court-appointed, supposedly impartial global expert to make an overall damages assessment and then to appoint to that important role a man whom Donziger hand-picked and paid to totally play ball with the
Lago Agrio plaintiffs. They then paid a Colorado consulting firm secretly to write all or most of the global experts report, falsely presented the report as the work of the court-appointed and supposedly impartial expert, and told half-truths
or worse to U.S. courts in attempts to prevent exposure of that and other wrongdoing. Ultimately, the [Lago Agrio Plaintiffs] team wrote the Lago Agrio courts judgment themselves and promised $500,000 to the Ecuadorian judge to rule in their
favor and sign their judgment.

The
appeals court stated that there was no basis for dismissal or reversal of the district courts judgment, noting that the record in the present case reveals a parade of corrupt actions by the [Lago Agrio Plaintiffs] legal
team, including coercion, fraud and bribery, culminating in the promise to Judge Zambrano of $500,000 from a judgment in favor of the [Lago Agrio Plaintiffs].</P><P style=""margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-right:6pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:arial"" align=""justify"">In addition to the Second Circuits opinion, two public prosecutors in South America have now issued opinions against enforcement
of the Ecuadorian judgment. On May 13, 2015, the public prosecutor in Brazil issued a nonbinding opinion recommending to the Brazilian Superior Court of Justice that it reject the Ecuadorian plaintiffs recognition and enforcement
request, finding, among other things, that the Ecuadorian judgment was procured through fraud and corruption and cannot be recognized because it violates Brazilian and international public order. Similarly, on April 19, 2016, the public
prosecutor in Argentina issued a nonbinding opinion recommending to the Argentine National Court, First Instance, that it reject the Ecuadorian plaintiffs recognition and enforcement request, finding, among other things, that enforcement of
the Ecuadorian judgment would violate Argentine public polcy. </P><P style=""margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-right:6pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:arial"" align=""justify"">On January 20, 2017, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice
granted the motions for summary judgment submitted by <mark>Chevron</mark> Canada Limited and <mark>Chevron</mark> Corporation, ruling that the two companies are separate legal entities with separate rights and obligations. As a result, the court dismissed the recognition
and enforcement claim against <mark>Chevron</mark> Canada Limited. <mark>Chevron</mark> Corporation remains a defendant in the action.</P><P style=""margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-right:6pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:arial"" align=""justify"">Your Board expects
<mark>Chevron</mark>s management to act in the best interests of the Companys stockholders and vigorously defend the Company against this fraudulent action. </P><P style=""margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-right:6pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:arial"" align=""justify"">Your Board believes that the 2010 stockholder vote to establish a 15 percent threshold for special meetings should be respected.

Oakland warns that rising sea levels will &quot;disproportionately impact and endanger&quot; low-income people and minorities, as well as the city's airport. </P><P> These concerns have been heightened by the devastating impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria on parts of the United States and Caribbean in recent weeks. </P><P><A href=""http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/15/us/<mark>climate</mark>-change-hurricanes-harvey-and-irma/index.html"">As CNN has reported</A>, the consensus among scientists is that the consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> -- rising sea levels and warming oceans -- made these hurricanes worse than they would have been in the past. That's because rising sea levels make storm surges from hurricanes worse, while warming waters help intensify the storms themselves. </P><P> The San Francisco lawsuit alleges that leading oil companies for decades ignored scientists who &quot;warned them in stark terms that fossil fuel usage would cause global warming&quot; that poses &quot;'catastrophic' harm.&quot; </P><P> Worse, Exxon and other oil companies have been accused of downplaying these risks to the public. </P><P><A href=""http://money.cnn.com/2017/08/23/investing/exxon-misled-<mark>climate</mark>-change-harvard-study/index.html""><SPAN class=""inStoryHeading"">Related: Harvard study: Exxon 'misled the public' on <mark>climate change</mark></SPAN></A></P><P> Comparing Big Oil to tobacco companies, San Francisco and Oakland argue that oil companies engaged in an &quot;organized campaign to deceive consumers about the dangers of massive fossil fuel production.&quot; </P><P> That argument may be strengthened by a recent Harvard study.

He represents Oakland and San Francisco in a lawsuit filed last September demanding that Exxon, Shell, <mark>Chevron</mark>, ConocoPhillips, and BP pay billions for sea walls and other defenses against ocean rise.</P><P>Just like with tobacco, the case could hinge on whether these companies lied to the public about the dangers of their business model. Berman has evidence that companies like Exxon knew burning oil causes <mark>climate change</mark> as early as the 1950s. Internally, oil companies <A href=""http://graphics.latimes.com/oil-operations/"" target=""_blank"">took steps</A> to protect their offshore oil rigs and Arctic pipelines from global warming while publicly they denied the science—the same way cigarette makers did research into cancer while denying their product was harmful. “Defendants stole a page from the Big Tobacco playbook,” the lawsuit <A href=""https://www.hbsslaw.com/uploads/case_downloads/<mark>climate</mark>_change/2017-09-19complaintforpublicnuisance.pdf"" target=""_blank"">alleges</A>.</P><P>Legally speaking, that argument might not be such a stretch. “The parallels to tobacco are quite clear,” Carroll Muffett, the president of the Washington, DC–based Center for International Environmental Law, told me. </P><P>Still, nobody has won a lawsuit like this and the oil companies I contacted didn’t seem to think Berman’s would be any different. “Should this litigation proceed,” a spokesperson for <mark>Chevron</mark> wrote in an email, “it will only serve special interests at the expense of broader policy, regulatory, and economic priorities.” Other, less biased observers also have doubts. “I’m not that sure actually,” said Martin Olszynski, a University of Calgary law professor <A href=""https://ablawg.ca/2017/04/26/do-comparisons-between-tobacco-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change-liability-withstand-scrutiny/"" target=""_blank"">who has researched</A> the parallels between oil and tobacco. “It seems obvious that at some point the defendants will say, ‘But look, there was demand for our product.’” </P><P>Berman himself failed to win a similar lawsuit in 2012, when a court <A href=""http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>change/2012/09/26/9th-circuit-affirms-dismissal-in-kivalina-v-exxonmobil/"" target=""_blank"">dismissed</A> his attempt to hold Exxon and about two dozen other fossil fuel producers responsible for the sea rise swallowing an Alaskan village. But a lot has changed since then. Science linking individual corporations to <mark>climate change</mark> is more sophisticated. Incriminating oil company documents are surfacing. New court decisions—especially a <A href=""http://beta.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-lead-paint-ruling-20171115-story.html"" target=""_blank"">recent ruling</A> against lead paint companies—are removing legal barriers. Suing big oil could be one way to win real environmental gains in the Trump era. “We have the federal government claiming there’s no <mark>climate change</mark>, we have the EPA rolling back,” Berman told me in an interview from his office on the 33rd floor of a Seattle high-rise. “[We can] use the law to accomplish what politicians won’t do.”</P><P>The reason not to dismiss Berman is that he has a history of proving doubters wrong. When he entered the legal fight against tobacco companies in the 1990s, mainstream opinion was that he would be unsuccessful. The owners of brands like Marlboro and Camel had crushed hundreds of lawsuits attempting to link cigarettes to cancer and emphysema. “No one had ever won a tobacco case,” Berman said. His own law partner was wary of getting involved. But in late 1998, the industry surrendered and agreed <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB911777383137557500"" target=""_blank"">to pay out</A> hundreds of billions of dollars. <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/mollenkamp-tobacco.html"" target=""_blank""><I>The People Vs. Big Tobacco</I></A>, a book about the case, described Berman as one of the “crucial players.”</P><P>The stakes are even higher in his big oil lawsuit. Berman is not just trying to get oil companies to pay for seawalls in the Bay Area. In a broader sense he’s attempting to hold them responsible for endangering all human life on earth. “This is different in kind from anything else,” Timothy Crosland, the director of a UK-based <mark>climate</mark> law group called Plan B, told me. “Once you get started, you get one case that goes through, this is an avalanche. It’s got the potential really to bring down the fossil fuel companies.” </P><P class=""article__text--dropcap"">For insight into Berman’s worldview it helps to go back to his 1960s upbringing in Highland Park, a Chicago suburb. “It was a really evolutionary time,” he said. “I grew up with a mother who was one of the first women to burn her bra.” His dad wanted to be a career Army officer but grew disillusioned by the Vietnam War and ended up running an insurance company. “He kind of became liberal himself,” Berman said. </P><P>Others he knew evolved from progressive to militant. They set off bombs and ran from the law. “They were elder brothers of some of my close friends and I’ve never seen them again,” Berman said. Though he’s not sure if they officially belonged to the <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground"" target=""_blank"">Weather Underground</A>, the left-wing organization that bombed US government buildings and banks in the 1970s and broke Timothy Leary out of jail, “they were in that genre of people out there doing radical stuff.” Berman chose to embrace the law. “The way to make change is to get trained in what the establishment does and make change through the process,” <A href=""https://www.superlawyers.com/washington/article/keep-it-simple-stupid/89fccc82-840a-4a05-8b25-3e8dc951a1c8.html"" target=""_blank"">he later told</A> the publication Super Lawyers.</P><P>Berman went to law school and moved out to Seattle, where he got hired by a firm that mostly did defense work for companies in industries like insurance. Berman was part of a smaller team at the firm that sued companies instead. In 1993, he met with a parent whose child had lost a kidney after eating at Jack in the Box and getting food poisoning. “I remember sitting in the room thinking, ‘This could have been my kid,’” he said. “I was so choked up I could barely talk.” His superiors at the firm didn’t want to take the case. “So I said, ‘I’m out of here.” </P><P>Berman and a colleague Carl Hagens <A href=""https://www.superlawyers.com/washington/article/keep-it-simple-stupid/89fccc82-840a-4a05-8b25-3e8dc951a1c8.html"" target=""_blank"">formed</A> their own firm, Hagens Berman. He’d wanted to set out on his own for some time and here was the perfect excuse. Two years later <A href=""https://hbsslaw.com/cases/jack-in-the-box"" target=""_blank"">they settled</A> with Jack in the Box for $12 million. </P><P>That case was tiny compared to what came next. In 1996, Washington’s attorney general hired Berman’s new firm to represent the state in a wave of public health lawsuits against tobacco companies. Soon Berman <A href=""https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/state-tobacco-litigation"" target=""_blank"">represented</A> 13 states. “The quiet youthful [lawyer] worked brutal hours to make up for his firm’s small size, arriving at his office at six AM and staying until nine or ten PM six days a week,” reads the book <A href=""https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-385-31935-5"" target=""_blank""><I>Civil Warriors: The Legal Siege on the Tobacco Industry</I></A>. His law partner was skeptical, according to Berman. “He was afraid we would lose the case,” he said. “If we devoted all our time to a losing effort and we didn’t have any income we could go under.”</P><P>It was a legitimate concern. By then hundreds of tobacco lawsuits had failed. Cigarette makers argued smoking was a personal choice. They pointed to research—often funded by the tobacco industry —<A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/15/us/tobacco-chiefs-say-cigarettes-aren-t-addictive.html?pagewanted=all"" target=""_blank"">casting doubt</A> on the link between cigarettes and cancer. But several factors aligned to make the industry vulnerable to litigation. A series of whistleblowers <A href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1996/05/wigand199605"" target=""_blank"">revealed</A> that tobacco companies knew smoking is addictive and causes cancer. Secret corporate documents showed companies did market research on how to <A href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/tobacco/stories/memos1.htm"" target=""_blank"">target children</A> with ads and branding. Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore filed a lawsuit <A href=""https://www.npr.org/2017/10/17/558390569/after-taking-on-big-tobacco-20-years-ago-former-mississippi-ag-is-trying-again-w"" target=""_blank"">demanding</A> tobacco companies pay the healthcare costs of smokers who’d become sick. And by 1998, 46 states were demanding the same.</P><P>Berman gave the opening statement at the trial in Washington in front of hundreds of people who had crowded into a Seattle courthouse. “I had a big poster that said, ‘The Industry’s Five Big Lies,’ and I went through each one,” he recalled. By then the industry was ready to surrender. Berman, Moore and others had been holding meetings with its leaders to negotiate the terms. On November, 1998, Big tobacco <A href=""http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Tobacco-Suit-Settled-for-206-Billion-46-states-2976948.php"" target=""_blank"">officially agreed</A> to pay $206 billion to 46 states. It received immunity from lawsuits similar to the ones led by Moore and Berman. Yet it was still a massive victory. “We were pretty damn happy,” he said.</P><P class=""article__pull-quote"">How can you prove that oil dug out of the ground by Exxon is causing a tiny Alaskan village to disappear?</P><P class=""article__text--dropcap"">Berman now had a game plan for defeating powerful industries: Accuse them of misleading the public to protect revenues, then find plaintiffs who are suffering the consequences. In the late 2000s, he heard about a coastal village in Alaska called Kivalina that would have to be relocated because of rising oceans. The move could <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/20090615/alaskas-soon-be-<mark>climate</mark>-refugees-sue-energy-companies-relocation"" target=""_blank"">cost up to $400 million</A>, according to his lawsuit, and the Army Corps of Engineers said <mark>climate change</mark> is to blame. Berman sued Exxon, <mark>Chevron</mark>, BP, ConocoPhillips, and 20 other fossil fuel producers on behalf of the villagers, arguing these companies spread doubt and confusion about <mark>climate change</mark> knowing communities such as Kivalina are in danger. Exxon, for instance, <A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/705605-xom-nyt-2000-3-23-unsettledscience.html"" target=""_blank"">had run</A> full-page <I>New York Times </I>ads about “unsettled science.”</P><P>“You’re not asking the court to evaluate the reasonableness of the conduct… You’re asking a court to evaluate if somebody conspired to lie,” Berman <A href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/06/conspiracy-theory/306812/"" target=""_blank"">told </A><A href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/06/conspiracy-theory/306812/"" target=""_blank""><I>The Atlantic</I></A> at the time. </P><P>Berman flew to Kivalina at one point. The village is built on an island off the west coast of Alaska. Its 400 or so indigenous residents had watched helplessly as shoreline disappeared, winter storms got fiercer, and waves lapped closer to the school. There was a pervasive feeling of despair. “The island is sad, sad that it’s going away,” he said. The magnitude of <mark>climate change</mark> hit him on the flight home. “You could see acres of dying trees from the pine bark beetle,” he said. “That was really striking.” A federal court <A href=""http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>change/2012/09/26/9th-circuit-affirms-dismissal-in-kivalina-v-exxonmobil/"" target=""_blank"">dismissed</A> the lawsuit, deciding that who’s to blame for <mark>climate change</mark> is a job best left to entities like Congress or the White House. But the real issue was causation. How can you prove that oil dug out of the ground by Exxon is causing a tiny Alaskan village to disappear? </P><P>“There is no realistic possibility of tracing any particular alleged effect of global warming to any particular emissions by any specific person, entity, group at any particular point in time,” <A href=""https://www.informea.org/sites/default/files/court-decisions/COU-158012.pdf"" target=""_blank"">wrote</A> US District Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong. It’s a tough obstacle to surmount. “In <mark>climate change</mark> there’s a lot of diffuse actors,” said the University of Calgary’s Olszynski. “It’s not just the oil companies.”</P><P>But there are several reasons Berman’s new lawsuit against big oil could be more successful. Whereas Kivalina was filed in federal court, he wants to represent the cities of San Francisco and Oakland in California state court, which he thinks may be less likely to decide the case raises political questions outside of its jurisdiction. And, he added, “Some people believe that there are more conservative judges on the federal bench.” The defense team for big oil is fighting to get the suit heard federally. The case was “going to be mired down for the next three or four months in a procedural battle,” Berman predicted. </P><P>There have also been big leaps in <mark>climate</mark> science. Researchers like Richard Heede <A href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/08/just-90-companies-are-blame-most-<mark>climate</mark>-change-<mark>carbon</mark>-accountant-says"" target=""_blank"">have calculated</A> that close to two-thirds of greenhouse gases emitted over the last 150 years can be traced back to just 90 companies. Exxon, <mark>Chevron</mark>, BP, Shell and ConocoPhillips<A href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-013-0986-y"" target=""_blank"">are in the top ten</A>. “We have better science,” Berman argued. “We think causation will be easier to prove.”</P><P>Financial damages from <mark>climate change</mark> are also more quantifiable. San Francisco estimates sea-level rise <A href=""https://www.hbsslaw.com/uploads/case_downloads/<mark>climate</mark>_change/2017-09-19complaintforpublicnuisance.pdf"" target=""_blank"">could threaten</A> $49 billion in property. “The major coastal cities in America and abroad have people worried about this,” he said. “That’s a big advancement since the Kivalina case.”</P><P>Incriminating oil industry documents, meanwhile, continue to surface. A report released in mid-November by the Center for International Environmental Law has new evidence that big oil was warned about the risks of global temperature rise nearly 50 years ago. “There seems to be no doubt that the potential damage to our environment could be severe,” <A href=""http://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Smoke-Fumes-FINAL.pdf"" target=""_blank"">explains</A> a 1969 study prepared for the American Petroleum Institute by two Stanford scientists. This wasn’t a one-off thing. “From the late 1960s onwards up into the 80s those warnings from their own scientists grew more and more urgent,” Muffett, the November report’s co-author, told me. An internal Exxon memo from 1981 <A href=""https://www.nationalobserver.com/2015/11/06/news/exxon-under-investigation-ny-historic-<mark>climate</mark>-denial"" target=""_blank"">states that</A> <mark>carbon</mark> emissions could “produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic—at least for a substantial fraction of the earth’s population.” By then the company had calculated that reducing its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint would hurt revenues. Internally, the industry <A href=""http://graphics.latimes.com/oil-operations/"" target=""_blank"">began to protect itself</A> from <mark>climate change</mark>. Companies designed taller offshore oilrigs and pipelines able to withstand melting permafrost. “[They] had a responsibility to warn the public,” Muffett said. Instead, Exxon, BP, <mark>Chevron</mark> and Shell formed a group known as the Global <mark>Climate</mark> Coalition <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/science/earth/24deny.html"" target=""_blank"">that argued</A> <mark>climate</mark> science “is not well understood” into the 90s. </P><P>These are clear parallels to the cancer-denying days of big tobacco. But in recent years the comparison has become harder to make. Big oil now publicly admits the existence of <mark>climate change</mark>. “Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue that requires global engagement and action,” a <mark>Chevron</mark> spokesperson wrote to me. Berman must convince a court that earlier industry denial campaigns created lasting damage. Even with better science, questions of responsibility still loom. “In the case of global <mark>climate change</mark>, a molecule of <mark>carbon</mark> is literally around the world in seven days,” Scott Segal, an attorney who defends energy companies, <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/07/20/this-could-be-the-next-big-strategy-for-suing-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change/?utm_term=.4d86a9dd3d58"" target=""_blank"">told the </A><A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/07/20/this-could-be-the-next-big-strategy-for-suing-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change/?utm_term=.4d86a9dd3d58"" target=""_blank""><I> Washington Post</I></A> in July. “The requisite causation needed for nuisance suits is missing and unprovable.” </P><P>That’s how the law has traditionally viewed things. Yet a recent ruling in California against lead paint companies suggests the law’s view on causation is evolving. “This may not sound like it has anything to do with <mark>climate change</mark>,” Olszynski told me, “but it does.” For 17 years, three paint companies—ConAgra, NL Industries, and Sherwin-Williams—argued in court that the lead paint they manufactured couldn’t be linked to specific houses where people got sick. But last month the California Court of Appeals <A href=""http://beta.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-lead-paint-ruling-20171115-story.html"" target=""_blank"">ruled that</A> their marketing “implied lead paint was safe,” even though the companies knew it was not. “That’s a really important point,” Olszynski explained. It could mean there’s a stronger case that oil companies are legally responsible for sea-rise damage in San Francisco and Oakland. They marketed and sold a product that they knew is causing <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>You could make the same argument about the coal industry. Or carmakers such as General Motors. “If the oil company took the barrel of oil out of the ground but it was consumed in the car, how do you apportion liability?” Olszynski asked. But he thinks that the legal fight against tobacco companies provides a case study for how these types of challenges can be beaten. “Guys like Steve were like visionaries,” he argued. “That’s an important story because it talks about the speed to which the legal system can change.” </P><P>As far as Berman is concerned the story isn’t over. On <mark>climate change</mark> he thinks it’s just getting started. If a judge decides his case can be heard—a big <I> if</I>, considering that no lawsuit against big oil has made it to that stage—then Berman can call on Exxon, BP, Shell, ConocoPhillips and <mark>Chevron</mark> to make internal reports and research into <mark>climate change</mark> available. “[I’m] dying to get to those documents,” he said. “I’m convinced they’re going to be smoking hot.” </P><P>As our interview came to a close I asked Berman to describe the best-case scenario for all this. “Imagine if I could get ten or 15 cities to all sue and put the same pressure on the oil companies that we did with tobacco companies and create some kind of massive settlement,” he said. He acted as if it was the first time he’d thought of the idea. But I got the feeling it wasn’t.</P><P><I> Geoff Dembicki is the author of Are We Screwed?

The city attorneys of San Francisco and Oakland, the suit's plaintiffs who are championed by <mark>climate change</mark> activists, were reportedly thrilled by the prospect. Some activists even compared the tutorial to the infamous Scopes Monkey Trial, <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/<mark>climate</mark>-alarmists-may-inherit-the-wind-1522605526"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">according</A> to the<EM> Wall Street Journal</EM>.</P><P>The suit accuses the energy companies–BP, <mark>Chevron</mark>, ExxonMobil, Conoco Phillips, and Shell–of contributing to <mark>climate change</mark> and conspiring to cover up their knowledge of the associated detrimental effects.</P><P>The lead attorney for the plaintiffs, Steven W. Berman, is expected to argue that because of the companies' contributions to <mark>climate change</mark>, municipalities are now being forced to commit financial resources to combatting environmental changes.</P><P>In defense, the companies' lawyers don't seem to be questioning the science behind <mark>climate change</mark>, but rather their clients' responsibility. The lawyers are expected to argue that the individuals who burn fossil fuels, rather than companies, are responsible for contributions to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>During the tutorial, the judge pointed to several inaccuracies in the data and materials provided by the plaintiffs, sometimes to the embarrassment of <mark>climate change</mark> activists.</P><P>Alsup also castigated the plaintiff's claims of a &quot;smoking gun&quot; document that would prove the conspiracy claims true. The plaintiffs pointed to a report that the companies had in their possession as proof they knew about the nefarious effects of <mark>climate change</mark> in 1995.</P><P>The &quot;smoking gun&quot; document in question proved to be a regurgitated summary of a 1995 report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>. At the time of its release, the report was subject to significant scrutiny by many in the scientific community because it was riddled with huge uncertainties.</P><P>&quot;There was a conspiratorial document within the defendants about how they knew good and well that global warming was right around the corner,&quot; Alsup said. &quot;Well, it turned out it wasn’t quite that.

The MSA resulted from a suit between the four largest tobacco producers in the United States and the attorneys general of 46 states. The attorneys general argued the states were entitled to compensation for the medical costs associated with caring for individuals suffering from smoking-related illnesses. The tobacco companies settled the suit, agreeing to pay $206 billion over the first 25 years of the agreement. The companies also agreed to impose restrictions and prohibitions on marketing tobacco products, especially to children and youth.</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Rather, he said, humanity's larger economic decisions are to blame.</P><SECTION class=""ad medium""><P class=""label"">Advertisement</P></SECTION><P>&quot;The IPCC does not say it's the extraction and production of oil that is driving these emissions,&quot; he said. &quot;It's economic activity that creates the demand for energy, and that leads to emissions.&quot;</P><P>The unusual five-hour hearing was required by Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, who is overseeing the cities' lawsuits seeking damages related to sea-level rise and other effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Earlier this month, Alsup asked the cities and oil companies to answer nine questions, including &quot;What are the main sources of <mark>CO2</mark> that account for the incremental buildup of <mark>CO2</mark> in the atmosphere?&quot; and &quot;What are the main sources of heat that account for the incremental rise in temperature on Earth?&quot;</P><P>In answering those questions, Boutrous hewed to the Fifth Assessment Report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC), issued in 2014. His presentation and the cities' presentation overlapped significantly, acknowledging the historic contributions of scientists including Joseph Fourier, John Tyndall, Svante Arrhenius, Gilbert Plass and Roger Revelle.</P><P>But where Boutrous relied nearly exclusively on the U.N. report, which draws on science from 2012 and earlier, the plaintiffs cited more-recent and more-specific findings, like the National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment and the state of California's Ocean Protection Council <A href=""http://www.opc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/docs/rising-seas-in-california-an-update-on-sea-level-rise-science.pdf"">guidance</A> on sea-level rise, both released last year.</P><P>Under active questioning from Alsup, Oxford University physicist Myles Allen explained the details of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide's role in preventing infrared radiation from leaving the atmosphere, how various parts of the Earth absorb the molecules, and how the greenhouse effect works on other planets. He only got through about one-third of his material before he had exhausted his allotted hour.</P><P>&quot;I didn't know that U.S. courts did this kind of thing,&quot; he said in an interview afterward. &quot;I think it's great.&quot;</P><P>Another scientist called by the plaintiffs, Gary Griggs, an oceanographer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who led the state report on sea-level rise, said that sea levels have been rising an average of 1.1 millimeters annually and warned of the possibility that polar ice sheets could melt and cause catastrophic rises.</P><P>Boutrous used the IPCC data to point to decreases in sea surface height off the West Coast from 1993 to 2012 and highlight the uncertainties of future projections of sea-level rise. &quot;Even his own study is saying there's a 0.1 percent chance&quot; of a 10-foot sea-level rise off San Francisco by 2100, he said of Griggs' research.</P><P>Alsup asked the plaintiffs where they differed from <mark>Chevron</mark>'s positions.</P><P>&quot;They do agree that humans are putting <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into the air, that does in fact cause warming, that does in fact cause sea-level rise,&quot; Alsup said. &quot;What critique would you make of what I just heard from the other side? They seem to be largely agreeing.&quot;</P><P>&quot;That's not what you see at all in the media, and that's why these points are emphasized,&quot; said Don Wuebbles, a University of Illinois atmospheric scientist who led a special science report for the most recent National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment and was assistant director at the Office of Science and Technology Policy under former President Obama. Wuebbles pointed out that over the past century, sea levels off San Francisco have risen 7.7 inches, according to tide gauges.</P><P>&quot;If you look at the time period since 2012, you actually go back to seeing an increase in the region,&quot; he said. &quot;That is a little different than the picture he [Boutrous] was trying to paint in his presentation. Again, the science does not stop in 2012.&quot;</P><P>The San Francisco and Oakland cases are among numerous lawsuits from California municipalities against oil companies for <mark>climate</mark> damages. Federal court Judge Vince Chhabria — located in the same building as Alsup — last week ruled that lawsuits from Imperial Beach, San Mateo and Marin County should not have been moved to federal court and sent them back to state court. He said that federal common law does not govern their claims. He's also handling suits from Richmond, Santa Cruz and Santa Cruz County but hasn't ruled yet on whether those should go back to state court. <mark>Chevron</mark> and ConocoPhillips are appealing Chhabria's decision.</P><P>&quot;As the defendants note, these state law claims raise national and perhaps global questions,&quot; Chhabria said in the order affecting Imperial Beach, San Mateo and Marin County. &quot;It may even be that these local actions are federally preempted. But to justify removal from state court to federal court, a defendant must be able to show that the case being removed fits within one of a small handful of small boxes. Because these lawsuits do not fit within any of those boxes, they were properly filed in state court and improperly removed to federal court.&quot;</P><P>Alsup ordered the other defendants in the suit — BP PLC, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, all of which had representatives at the hearing — to submit briefs within two weeks detailing any points of disagreement with <mark>Chevron</mark>. &quot;Otherwise, I'm going to assume you're in agreement,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't get away with sitting there in silence and then later say, 'He wasn't speaking for us.'&quot;</P><P>Plaintiffs criticized <mark>Chevron</mark> and the other companies' approach.</P><P>&quot;What we saw today was one oil company begrudgingly accept the scientific consensus while trying to overemphasize the extent of scientific uncertainty,&quot; San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement. &quot;The other four major oil companies refused to even participate or recognize the court has jurisdiction over them. Apparently they think they're above the law.&quot;</P><P>Other observers said that it was notable that <mark>Chevron</mark> acknowledged mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science, but that it could be years before the case is resolved. The companies have all filed motions to dismiss both suits; presuming the suits continue, both courts would need to reach decisions before an appeal could be heard.</P><P>&quot;The sea-rise evidence and the sea-rise data is so much stronger than it was six years ago that they can kind of use the IPCC as a conservative approach, whereas the plaintiffs are taking the current, state-of-the-art approach,&quot; said Bill Rossbach, a trial lawyer consulting for the Center for <mark>Climate</mark> Integrity.</P><P>&quot;I'm sure they have other bases for thinking that they are not liable, and those are all going to be put forth in legal arguments to have the court throw the case out,&quot; he said. &quot;There's a long way from here to them writing a check.&quot;</P><P><EM>Reporter Anne C.

And as the Trump administration seeks to play down <mark>climate change</mark>, some states are pushing back. Now, two California cities have brought a lawsuit against the <mark>Chevron</mark> Corporation and other big oil companies, looking to find them responsible for their role in <mark>climate change</mark>. And because the federal judge in the case felt he wasn’t quite up on his <mark>climate</mark> science, he asked each side to teach him how they view the state of the research.</P><P>Molly Peterson was in that courtroom and is here to fill us in on that story. She’s a reporter for KQED Science out there in San Francisco. Thanks for joining us this hour.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah, my pleasure.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So each side had a different tactic for presenting the <mark>climate</mark> data. Tell us. <mark>Chevron</mark> was the only company, though, representing all the oil companies.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah, that day, he was. So for both sides, the judge wanted both the current state of the science and a kind of history of what they knew, what scientists knew, when they knew it. Each side had two hours to present. The cities turned it over to scientists. The City Attorney was there to introduce scientists to give this story. And <mark>Chevron</mark> used a lawyer to convey its information.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So what was his argument?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Well, I mean, he went on the record saying, it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the 20th century. So <mark>Chevron</mark> says, it has been its position for 10 years that it accepts the findings of the IPCC report. But at the same time, <mark>Chevron</mark> was also pointing out and casting doubt wherever it could on how certain scientists were about the influence of humans on <mark>climate change</mark> over this time.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: And so San Francisco and Oakland are the two cities involved in this case. And so they presented their side.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: And their side focused a lot on sea level rise, because obviously, that’s a major concern in California. And I should say that this is part of this growing body of cases, not just San Francisco and Oakland, but the city of Richmond, San Mateo County, Imperial, Beach in Southern California, these other cities are also suing using different legal strategies that one historian of science kind of told me reminded him of the tobacco lawsuits.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Yeah. And so, they’re upset, of course, that if the oceans are rising, they’re going to be underwater. And they can show, then, that there is actual money damages that are going to occur to their cities.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: That’s right. I mean, in San Francisco in particular, they’re talking about billions of dollars, including, I think, a $350 million bond that might be on the ballot there later this year. The city’s got engineers and consultants out there, trying to figure out what would happen to the Embarcadero along San Francisco. So yeah, they are connecting it to that.</P><P>And so, the presence of IPCC science and scientists was interesting and important, because the most recent IPCC was 2013, 2014. The end of the data for that report was 2012. And a lot has happened in sea level rise science since then.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Now, I understand this isn’t the first time that this judge has done research for a court case.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: No, it’s not. And he doesn’t do it exclusively in science. But he did it for LIDAR in a case involving self-driving cars. He did it for DACA recently. He’s famous for having taught himself how to program in Basic, and for learning a few lines of Java for a case involving Oracle.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Wow. So where does this head? This is not the actual court case itself, right?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: It’s not. In fact, <mark>Chevron</mark> was kind of subtly trying to make this argument that it is also filed with the court a motion to dismiss. <mark>Chevron</mark> says, this is a global problem. It needs a global solution. So even though they’re saying that human activity contributed to this, they say that they’re beyond the reach of this court. So the judge still has to rule on that.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So do all of the oil companies agree with what <mark>Chevron</mark> is saying?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Well, at the of the hearing, the judge looked at the other oil companies and said, do you agree with everything this guy said? And they all kind of sat there. And he said, well, you can have two weeks, which is up just about now, for them to weigh in on every single word that was said. So he said to them, his message was clear, you can’t get away sitting here in silence.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So there’s going to be a lot more we’re going to hear about this, as it moves forward.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah. I mean, it is interesting that the judge is trying to figure out how to use this science as evidence, if the case goes forward. Yeah,</P><P>IRA FLATOW: And how, then, to turn it into damages, if you’re going to penalize somebody. What’s your role or your part in it?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah. I mean, with the tobacco cases, I think we’re talking about $250 billion so far that tobacco companies have paid as settlements.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Well, we’ll see. Thank you, Molly, for taking time to be with us today. We’ll check in later as it’s necessary.

It’s no secret that Mr. Watson has too often lagged on his response to <mark>climate change</mark>. As the board selects a new CEO, it has a chance to turn a new leaf and move <mark>Chevron</mark> toward the right side of history on <mark>climate change</mark>, better positioning the company to address investor and social demands for cleaner energy and <mark>climate</mark> risk management.</P><P>Here’s what their new CEO should bring to the table:</P><P><STRONG>A vision for how the company adapts and leads in the low <mark>carbon</mark> transition</STRONG></P><P><mark>Chevron</mark> withheld support for the Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord even as peers like Exxon and Shell supported it. Opposing the vast majority of the rest of the world is not an economically <mark>sustainable</mark> posture for a global company –and it creates unnecessary risks for shareholders. The board should select a CEO with a vision to adapt and lead in the transition to a cleaner energy economy. Simply acknowledging the reality of <mark>climate change</mark> is no longer enough – a 21<SUP>st</SUP> century energy leader also develops a sound business plan to navigate that reality and help the global community address one of its costliest challenges.</P><P><STRONG>A strategy to engage constructively on GHG policies in the states and federally</STRONG></P><P>While companies like Noble and Anadarko supported sensible methane protections in Colorado, and some in industry stood quietly on the sidelines or worked through trade associations, <mark>Chevron</mark> vociferously opposed standards. Years later, we know that the methane standards work by cutting emissions and helping businesses reduce waste and earn their license to operate.</P><P>As other states size up the opportunity to tackle methane emissions, <mark>Chevron</mark>’s new CEO should recognize state-level environmental protections for what they are: an opportunity to demonstrate responsibility and secure progress that investors and customers demand. A compelling CEO candidate will seek appropriate balance in securing short-term cost efficiencies that help margins in a challenging price environment, while also investing in supporting public policy development that furthers license to operate for the longer term, at reasonable cost.</P><P><mark>Chevron</mark> peers like Exxon and Shell have been recognized for complying with EPA methane safeguards despite regulatory uncertainty, yet <mark>Chevron</mark> has remained quiet. The new CEO should recognize the value of national protections that create a level playing field. He or she should signal a responsible path in the first 100 days by committing to stay the course with basic, proven controls that keep product in the pipeline.</P><P><STRONG>A commitment to address methane emissions in its global operations</STRONG></P><P>As a global company with a global footprint, <mark>Chevron</mark> has an opportunity to magnify the positive impact of environmental commitments. Strong CEO candidates will look for tangible, cost-effective actions that show a dedication to reduce <mark>Chevron</mark>’s global greenhouse gas footprint.</P><P>While it’s positive that <mark>Chevron</mark> reports its baseline emissions and conducts some level of leak detection and repair, investors and other stakeholders have little detail beyond this to understand how the company is managing methane. Also, while <mark>Chevron</mark> is part of the World Bank flaring reduction initiative, they should also set a quantitative methane reduction target or join others like BP and Statoil in the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership, a UN sponsored initiative to boost transparency and spur best practice adoption to control emissions from top known sources.</P><P>As <mark>Chevron</mark> trumpets its “Human Energy” campaign, it is time to select a CEO who will harness the company’s energy to become part of the <mark>climate</mark> solution. Shareholders and society stand to benefit.</P><DIV class=""wp_rp_wrap  wp_rp_plain"" id=""wp_rp_first""><DIV class=""wp_rp_content""><H3 class=""related_post_title"">Related Posts</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

BP,</EM><A name=""_ftnref1"" href=""#_ftn1"">[1]</A>  Judge Alsup fired questions about global warming and <mark>climate change</mark> at plaintiffs and defendants alike.  The local governments have alleged that five major energy companies created a public nuisance by extracting and promoting the sale of fossil fuels with the knowledge that such products caused global warming.</P><P>Only one of the defendants’ attorneys spoke at the tutorial.  Counsel for <mark>Chevron</mark> accepted the general scientific consensus that humans are primarily responsible for <mark>climate change</mark>.  However, focusing extensively on a 2013 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, <mark>Chevron</mark>’s lawyer highlighted uncertainties surrounding the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, including sea level rise. </P><P>The cities called several experts to present their side to the court.  Myles Allen, head of the <mark>Climate</mark> Dynamics group at the University of Oxford, asserted that science has recognized since the 1950’s the effects and sources of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere.  University of California at Santa Cruz professor Gary Griggs and University of Illinois professor Don Wuebbles outlined the increasing rate of sea level rise.</P><P>Judge Alsup, who has employed tutorials in other complex scientific cases, indicated at the end of the hearing that the remaining defendant companies, who have objected to the court’s personal jurisdiction, had two weeks to file written statements agreeing with or refuting points made by <mark>Chevron</mark>’s counsel.<A name=""_ftnref2"" href=""#_ftn2""><SPAN>[2]</SPAN></A>  </P><P><STRONG>Motions to Dismiss – San Francisco/Oakland Cases</STRONG></P><P>A day before the tutorial, defendants in the Oakland and San Francisco cases filed several motions to dismiss the lawsuits.<A name=""_ftnref3"" href=""#_ftn3""><SPAN>[3]</SPAN></A>  The primary motion, filed by <mark>Chevron</mark> and joined by the other defendants, centered on an argument that the Clean Air Act displaced the plaintiffs’ claims. </P><P>Defendants argued that, despite the focus of the cities’ claims on the production and sale of fossil fuels, not the eventual combustion of those fuels, the court should hold that the “domestic portions” of plaintiffs’ claims at least are displaced under <EM>AEP v. Connecticut</EM><A name=""_ftnref4"" href=""#_ftn4"">[4]</A> and <EM>Kivalina v.

It represents a substantial update to their report last year, with greater insight into the company’s thinking and scenario analysis approach.</P><P>It contains a number of tropes that may be familiar to the well-versed in oil and gas <mark>climate</mark> disclosures – for example narrowing the scope of <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>tracker.org/refs-and-resources/terms-list/#stranded-assets"" title=""Stranded Assets"">stranded assets</A>, and characterising the energy sector impacts of a low <mark>carbon</mark> transition as gradual and well-signposted, thereby depriving investors of an assessment of the volumes and capex at risk should the company misread the pace of the transition.</P><P>However, for the first time, it includes a consideration of a low-demand world and some disclosure at the asset level. Caginess abounds, but this is an important step on the industry’s journey and <mark>Chevron</mark> are to be commended.</P><P>A common theme remains oil and gas companies’ reluctance to put numbers on how they might fare in an energy transition. We wonder which company will be the first take this important step.</P><H3><STRONG>2 degree scenario analysis: comparison of supply/demand</STRONG></H3><P><mark>Chevron</mark> has based its analysis on the demand pathway in the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) main de<mark>carbon</mark>isation scenario, which assumes a 50% probability of limiting global temperature rises to 2°C. Specifically, it has input those demand projections into their own model of supply and commodity prices and utilised the resulting price output to test their assets.  While details of the assumptions in that model are lacking, the approach is an instructive one in that it takes an approach based on supply/demand fundamentals consistent with <mark>Chevron</mark>’s own long-term planning processes and demonstrates that such modelling can be done.</P><P>However, <mark>Chevron</mark> does not indicate what prices its model delivers, leaving substantial uncertainty regarding the prices used.  <mark>Chevron</mark> contends that it cannot disclose this because of the potential for commercial harm—we believe that commercial sensitivities around long-term prices are overstated, given the difficulty of forecasting prices accurately.  However, we would think that the company could at least provide a sensitivity approach across a range of prices which would provide investors useful information without revealing modelled outputs.</P><H3><STRONG>Asset level analysis – tentative, but there</STRONG></H3><P><mark>Chevron</mark> does provide some detail on certain major assets, but does not make an overall quantitative assessment. For example, <mark>Chevron</mark> notes that its Kazakhstan Future Growth Project and the Australian Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects will “generate cash”. In contrast, the base business in Kazakhstan, deepwater assets in the Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria, and heavy oil in California will “generate cash and earnings”.</P><P>It should not be a surprise that any project would generate cash once it has been built, even in a challenging price environment. If the majority of capital investment has already been sunk, it will continue to produce while it can cover its variable costs, which are likely to be relatively low. However, the real test is whether such a project will ultimately deliver adequate financial returns on the original investment.</P><P>We therefore read this as tacit admission that the first three projects don’t create value in a low-demand world – i.e. that they would be stranded.</P><P>Like other companies that have attempted similar exercises, they refrain from offering any financial measures of this stranding. However, that they have done this analysis and released some of the results, albeit in purely qualitative terms, is notable.</P><H3><STRONG>Stranded assets – a financial test of value, applying to reserves and resources</STRONG></H3><P>It seems strange, then, that <mark>Chevron</mark> argues separately that assets will not be stranded, this time based on their reserve estimates. They are not the first to attempt to limit the definition of stranding to a) proven reserves only; and b) whether these will be physically produced. However, this artificially narrows the scope. The generally understood definition is a financial test and applies to all assets, not just the proven reserves subset. For example, in the IEA report that <mark>Chevron</mark> cites frequently, stranded assets are “<EM>capital investment in fossil-fuel infrastructure that ends up failing to be recovered over the operating lifetime of the asset because of reduced demand or lower prices resulting from <mark>climate policy</mark></EM>” <A href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"">[3]</A>.</P><P>Clearly, if it is acknowledged that a project with capital investment previously estimated at $54bn <A href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"">[4]</A> cannot deliver positive earnings in an energy transition scenario, then there is an issue that shouldn’t be sidled out of with semantics. <mark>Chevron</mark>’s dismissal of the stranded assets concept feels at out of place in the report as a whole.</P><H3><STRONG>Downstream – approach sensible, detail lacking</STRONG></H3><P>In their discussion of the downstream (refining) industry, <mark>Chevron</mark>’s thinking is similar to <mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker’s <A href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"">[5]</A>, assuming that lower refinery runs will lead to lower profitability and investment across the industry, with excess capacity forced to be rationalised.</P><P>Again however, decision-useful detail is absent. <mark>Chevron</mark> notes that it’s Richmond Refinery Modernization Project “benefits” from having sunk most of its capex – investment may prolong the operating life, but will that capex actually deliver a return if margins are falling?</P><H3><STRONG><mark>Carbon</mark> prices – a small part of the picture</STRONG></H3><P><mark>Chevron</mark> makes much of its internal <mark>carbon</mark> price analysis, but does not disclose its forecasts fearing this would “erode” its competitive advantage. Although they can give significant differentiation between particular assets, internal <mark>carbon</mark> prices are likely to have a limited impact on upstream project sanction overall. For example, a price of $40/tCO<SUB>2</SUB>, far above those currently prevailing, would add $1-2/bbl to upstream costs on average. Even then, it would only impact margins if it could not be passed through to consumers, as <mark>Chevron</mark> notes. We would be interested to hear of any assets that have failed the <mark>carbon</mark> price test.</P><P>The greater impact of lower demand is likely to be on commodity prices; here <mark>Chevron</mark> are sanguine. An emphasis on supply/demand equilibrium leads them to conclude that oil price impacts would be “muted”. Competition between producers would be “intense”, yet margins “would not necessarily be impacted”. Of course this is educated guesswork, but we note that volatility since 2014 was incurred by a ~2% imbalance in supply/demand and was steadied by co-ordinated OPEC action, perhaps less likely with the envisaged rivalry on cost.</P><H3><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></H3><P><mark>Chevron</mark> dedicates 6 pages to supporting its view that oil and gas demand will continue to grow. The implication is that the Paris Agreement commitments will be missed, and by a long chalk – a similar scenario <A href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"">[6]</A> gives a 50/50 chance of global warming being above/below 2.7°C. Everyone is perfectly entitled to their own opinions on how the world’s energy system might evolve. But the important issue is whether managements are taking downside risks seriously and giving shareholders sufficient detail to understand their positioning.</P><P>The disclosure debate takes a step forward each time a company goes beyond its peers in a particular aspect, and <mark>Chevron</mark> sets an important precedent. There is recognition of asset stranding, wordplay aside. There is an interesting qualitative discussion of low-demand impacts and evidence of 2°C scenario analysis at the asset level, although coy. There is an effort to incorporate the voluntary recommendations of the Taskforce on <mark>Climate</mark>-related Financial Disclosures. We would like to see the industry keep up this momentum and look harder at areas such as value implications, and capex at risk.  If management’s belief is that <mark>climate</mark> targets will be missed, they will likely invest on these convictions; what is the value at risk in such a misread?  <mark>Chevron</mark>, like others seems to suggest that they will see it coming and avoid pouring capital into projects uneconomic in a 2°C world.  The industry’s spending up to the 2014 price crash suggests that investors cannot assume this level of omniscience.</P><P>Such hesitancy is somewhat understandable. <mark>Climate change</mark> disclosures are in unchartered waters and companies have a keen eye on their competitors’ movements. There are no doubt internal battles being fought.  And there is the lingering question in the wake of the TCFD as to whether a completely voluntary regime for these disclosures can and will deliver decision-useful information.  We think that readers should recognise the progress in this report and we look forward to further detail of quantitative outcomes and developments in <mark>Chevron</mark>’s business and reporting.</P><P><STRONG>Andrew Grant</STRONG> – Senior Analyst<STRONG>Robert Schuwerk</STRONG> – Executive-Director (North America)</P><P><A href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"">[1]</A> ExxonMobil, “2018 Energy &amp; <mark>Carbon</mark> Summary”, February 2018</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup, who is currently hearing the case, ordered both sides to answer a <A href=""https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:2017cv06011/318403/138"" target=""_blank"">series of questions</A> about <mark>climate</mark> science in a two-hour presentation each. </P><P><mark>Chevron</mark> was the only company whose lawyer actually presented at the tutorial.

				Waves crash against a seawall along the Embarcadero in San Francisco in 2010.									<P class=""credits"">Eric Risberg / AP</P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class=""entry-content single-post-content""><P>SAN FRANCISCO — Outside a courtroom where a much-anticipated court hearing on <mark>climate</mark> science took place on Wednesday is an old photo of San Francisco’s coastline. Dated 1865, it features an area of the city known as North Beach, which back then was covered in ramshackle wooden houses on a sandy slope nuzzled up against the shore. Since then, the coastline has been extended, filled in with sand (<A href=""https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/making-up-ground/"">and most likely boats and other strange things</A>) to stretch several blocks farther into the brackish waters of the San Francisco Bay. A sea wall, <A href=""http://abc7news.com/politics/san-franciscos-cracking-seawall-needs-$250m-makeover/3235921/"">badly in need of repair</A>, keeps the bay at bay.</P><P>That very sea wall is at the heart of the court case — The People of the State of California v. BP P.L.C. et al. — that was the reason for Wednesday’s spectacle. The cities of Oakland and San Francisco are suing the five biggest fossil fuel companies on the planet — BP, <mark>Chevron</mark>, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell — for <A href=""http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/environment/article206025399.html"">billions of dollars</A> for past damages and to prevent future flooding from sea level rise. Since the companies extracted fuel that altered the planet, the argument goes, they should pay for the consequences. It’s a modern version of “you break it, you buy it.” The oil companies have filed to dismiss the lawsuit on many grounds, including that it’s the government’s job to set and enforce <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels — not theirs.</P><P>On Wednesday, no one was yet on trial. <A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber"">U.S. District Judge William Alsup</A> made that very clear to the throng of spectators who filled the chambers, a spillover courtroom and the halls outside. Instead, we were there to see a tutorial, an effort to help this self-described “poor judge” learn the science behind the case. It was going to be a boring morning full of numbers and diagrams, he warned the audience.</P><P>But in this polarized moment, a public tussling over the basics of <mark>climate</mark> science, however cursory, is anything but boring. And as each side in the case presented a history of <mark>climate change</mark> science, it was striking just how much the two sides agreed on: <mark>Climate change</mark> is happening, and humans are in large part responsible. But that’s not really what this court case is about. Rather, it’s about who knew what and when, how much uncertainty there is around future predictions and who should be held responsible (and liable) for a future with higher seas and more extreme weather events. That’s where the cities’ and corporations’ use of evidence diverged.</P><P>First up: the scientists.</P><P>At a big rectangular table in the center of the room, the cities were represented by Steve Berman, a lawyer known for his ability to <A href=""https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43qw3j/meet-the-lawyer-trying-to-make-big-oil-pay-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">get big settlements out of big corporations</A>, as well as some of their own lawyers. But aside from a few introductory remarks, Berman left the talking to a few of the world’s leading experts on <mark>climate change</mark>. First, he called Myles Allen, who is a professor of geosystem science at Oxford University and was tasked with providing a historiography of <mark>climate change</mark> research.</P><P>In true scientist fashion, the talk was filled with jargon and complicated scientific concepts. Alsup, who made clear that he would call out confusing charts or unclear explanations, asked Allen what made <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, which is emitted from burning fossil fuels and have led to a warming planet, special. Allen, equal to the task, began to pantomime his answer. Arms stretched out to the side, fists in a ball, he shimmied left and right, showing how the charge on a <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide molecule could be unevenly distributed, absorbing the infrared waves that are naturally emitted from Earth, unlike oxygen and nitrogen, whose charge is symmetric. That infrared gets trapped within Earth’s atmosphere, instead of escaping, causing the planet to warm.</P><P>After walking through key figures and research from the last century of <mark>climate</mark> science, Allen concluded by saying that we’ve known that the planet was warming since the 1970s. And crucially, he said, we knew back then that we might not know how bad <mark>climate change</mark> would be, or be able to feel and see the effects of that warming, until it was already too late.</P><P>The next speaker, Gary Griggs, an oceanographer who works at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was deep into an explanation of sea level rise when a loud, piercing alarm went off. “Coastal flood alert,” Alsup quipped as soon as it finished. The room broke out in laughter. It wasn’t clear whether it was real or a drill, but nature has a way of making itself known.</P><P>Next up: the lawyers.</P><P>While the cities relied on scientists, the energy companies relied on lawyers. One in particular: Theodore Boutrous, a lawyer for <mark>Chevron</mark> (which is headquartered in the Bay Area) did all of the talking. And he got straight to the point, answering the question on everyone’s mind: Yes, <mark>Chevron</mark> accepts the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>. And in honor of that consensus, he’d be relying almost entirely on the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, a United Nations-backed consortium meant to provide a scientific view of what <mark>climate change</mark> is doing to the planet, to lay out his understanding of the science and the history.</P><P>He kicked off by quoting from the IPCC’s <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/"">most recent report</A>, from 2013, citing population growth and economic changes as the most important drivers of <mark>climate change</mark>. The report, he noted, says nothing about fossil-fuel extraction as a driver of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Boutrous offered a history lesson that had a lot in common with Allen’s, but with a much greater focus on the uncertainty around both the science and the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on the Bay Area. He illustrated that uncertainty in various ways, describing how theories that posited alternative roles of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere held sway through at least the 1950s. Boutros also showed how actual temperatures hadn’t been as extreme as many <mark>climate</mark> forecasts predicted in the years leading up to the report. Alsup asked if his point was that the models exaggerated the impact of humans on the <mark>climate</mark>. “Instead of doom and gloom, it’s just gloom?” he asked the lawyer. Boutrous chuckled and moved on.</P><P>Boutrous concluded by showing a map of sea level rise, saying that sea levels had fallen around San Francisco in the years leading up to the 2013 IPCC report. There’s a lot of uncertainty about the future, he concluded, noting that San Francisco and Oakland had reported that <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-municipalities-debt-disclosures-contrast-with-<mark>climate</mark>-warnings-1515456551"">exact message to bond investors</A> in 2017, when the cities said they couldn’t predict whether major flooding or storms might have a major, adverse impact on the local economy.</P><P>Finally, the tutorial pivoted back to the cities, so it pivoted back to the scientists. Don Wuebbles, who is a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois and co-wrote the 2007 IPCC report that helped the organization win the Nobel Peace Prize, was the final scientist called by the cities. He began by pointing out that he’d also led the writing of the first chapter in the 2013 IPCC report that Boutrous had so carefully recounted. “I think it’s important to recognize that science did not stop; there’s a lot we’ve learned in the last five years,” Wuebbles said. That’s why he’d be using <A href=""https://science2017.globalchange.gov/"">data from the U.S. Global Change Research Program</A>, which produces more frequent, national reports on <mark>climate change</mark> to make his presentation.</P><P>The year after the most recent IPCC report was published was the hottest on record, Wuebbles told the court. Then 2015 topped 2014, and 2016 topped 2015. Temperatures are going up, precipitation is increasing, extreme events are more frequent. Looking at a broader set of years, sea level has risen around the San Francisco Bay. Alsup asked Wuebbles whether he disagreed with Boutrous’s recounting of the science.</P><P>Not really, since the lawyer had based his presentation on the IPCC, and a report that Wuebbles was heavily involved with. But Wuebbles’s point was that the IPCC report doesn’t tell all of what we know in 2018. The IPCC report might not be wrong, but that doesn’t mean that it gives the best picture of what’s right.</P><P>As the tutorial concluded, Alsup had a few final remarks. “I wore my science tie today,” he said, pointing to the solar system hanging around his neck before standing up to leave. “I hope someone takes note of that.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV class=""mini-bio""><P>Anna Maria Barry-Jester reports on public health, food and culture for FiveThirtyEight.  <SPAN class=""twitter""><A href=""https://twitter.com/annabarryjester"" target=""_blank""><SPAN class=""twitter-username"">@annabarryjester</SPAN></A></SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class=""tags""><P class=""filed-under"">Filed under</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In the proxy statement, the company’s Board attempts to convince shareholders that <mark>Chevron</mark>’s political activities—which include support for groups that spread <mark>climate</mark> disinformation—are in shareholders’ long-term interests.</P><P>Pressure continues to mount on major fossil fuel companies like <mark>Chevron</mark> to renounce disinformation on <mark>climate</mark> science and policy and begin to plan for a world free from <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>. Here’s a preview of some of the key <mark>climate</mark>-related issues on the agenda at <mark>Chevron</mark>’s annual meeting on May 31 in Midland, Texas.</P><H3>Systemic economic risks</H3><P>There is substantial backing in the business and investor communities for strengthening and harmonizing <mark>climate</mark>-related financial disclosures by companies in all sectors. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. Recognizing the potential systemic risks posed by <mark>climate change</mark> to the global economy and economic system, the FSB set up a Task Force on <mark>Climate</mark>-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) chaired by former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.</P><P>In December 2016, the TCFD released its <A href=""https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/publications/recommendations-report/"" target=""_blank"">Recommendations Report</A>. The TCFD recommended disclosure of <mark>climate</mark>-related financial risks in mainstream (i.e., public) financial filings. Specifically, the TCFD recommended that companies disclose what a 2° Celsius scenario would mean for their businesses, strategies, and financial planning.</P><P>The Union of Concerned Scientists and other stakeholders have provided comments on the TCFD’s Recommendations Report, which is expected to be taken up by the leaders of G20 countries this year.</P><P>Now is a good time to consider how <mark>Chevron</mark>’s 2017 financial filings measure up to these mainstream recommendations and expectations.</P><H3>2°C scenario planning</H3><P>Increasingly, shareowners of major fossil energy companies are <A href=""http://blog.ucsusa.org/kathy-mulvey/<mark>chevron</mark>-exxonmobil-shareholder-meetings"" target=""_blank"">calling for </A>annual reporting on how <mark>climate</mark> policies may affect their business in light of the globally agreed target to limit global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. This year, <mark>Chevron</mark> shareholders have put forward a resolution calling for annual planning on <A href=""https://www.ceres.org/investor-network/resolutions/publish-annual-assessment-of-2-degree-scenario-2017"" target=""_blank"">2°C scenarios</A>, along with a proposal on <A href=""https://www.ceres.org/investor-network/resolutions/report-on-transition-to-low-<mark>carbon</mark>-economy-2017"" target=""_blank"">transition to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy</A>. In 2016, the 2°C scenario planning <A href=""https://www.ceres.org/investor-network/resolutions/<mark>chevron</mark>-ghg-goals-2016-1"" target=""_blank"">resolution</A> won the support of more than 40% of <mark>Chevron</mark> shareholders.</P><P>In our inaugural <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/<mark>climate</mark>scorecard"" target=""_blank""><EM><mark>Climate</mark> Accountability Scorecard</EM></A> released last October, UCS assessed how <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2016/10/<mark>climate</mark>-accountability-scorecard-<mark>chevron</mark>-fact-sheet.pdf"" target=""_blank""><mark>Chevron</mark></A> is planning for a world free from <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>—and scored the company “poor.” We recommended that <mark>Chevron</mark>:</P><UL><LI>Publicly acknowledge the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement’s long-term goal and its implications for the swift transition to global net-zero emissions;</LI><LI>Disclose emissions resulting from the company’s operations and the use of its products;</LI><LI>Set and disclose initial near-term company-wide targets to reduce emissions from its operations and the use of its products;</LI><LI>Develop and publicly communicate a clear plan and timeline to deepen emissions reductions consistent with the Paris agreement’s long-term goal.</LI></UL><P>In the 2017 proxy statement, <mark>Chevron</mark>’s board recommends a “no” vote on both the 2°C scenario planning and transition to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy proposals. The Board asserts that <mark>Chevron</mark>’s report “<A href=""https://www.<mark>chevron</mark>.com/-/media/<mark>chevron</mark>/shared/documents/<mark>climate</mark>-risk-perspective.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Managing <mark>Climate Change</mark> Risks: A Perspective for Investors</A>,” released last month, substantially addresses the issues raised by its shareowners in these resolutions, despite a lack of such disclosures in the company’s U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting.</P><P>This report comes to some extraordinary conclusions, including:</P><UL><LI>“…<mark>Chevron</mark>’s current risk management and business planning processes are sufficient to mitigate the risks associated with <mark>climate change</mark>.”</LI><LI>“…the current risk exposure to the Company even in a restricted GHG [greenhouse gas] scenario is minimal.”</LI></UL><P>Yet “Managing <mark>Climate Change</mark> Risks” is not a robust analysis of the potential business, strategic, and financial implications of <mark>climate</mark>-related risks and opportunities for <mark>Chevron</mark>. It fails to meet the expectations of shareholders or align with the TCFD recommendations. Among its shortcomings, the report:</P><UL><LI>Provides no description of how 2°C scenario analysis is integrated into <mark>Chevron</mark>’s investment decision making or strategic business planning;</LI><LI>Includes limited discussion of market and technological risks to <mark>Chevron</mark>’s business model and provides no detail on its current or projected low-<mark>carbon</mark> investments;</LI><LI>Does not acknowledge <mark>climate</mark>-related risks to <mark>Chevron</mark>’s reputation;</LI><LI>Provides some information about <mark>Chevron</mark>’s assessment of <mark>climate</mark>-related physical risks, but does not disclose how it determines their materiality or how it plans to manage these risks in the future.</LI></UL><H3>Potential investigations and litigation</H3><P>In contrast to the rosy outlook presented in “Managing <mark>Climate Change</mark> Risks,” <mark>Chevron</mark>’s annual <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93410/000009341017000013/cvx-123116x10kdoc.htm"" target=""_blank"">10-K report</A> for 2016 (filed in February 2017) acknowledged that “Increasing attention to <mark>climate change</mark> risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and, potentially, private litigation against the company.” This is an extraordinary admission, for several reasons:</P><UL><LI>Companies only have to disclose to investors risks that could have a “material adverse effect” on them—that is, risks to their bottom lines. Most companies resist identifying a risk as material until they have no choice but to do so.</LI><LI>To date, only ExxonMobil is known to be under investigation by governmental authorities—specifically, the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts and the SEC. <mark>Chevron</mark> is apparently concerned that it, too, could face scrutiny for misleading investors and consumers about <mark>climate change</mark>.</LI><LI>Up until recently, <mark>Chevron</mark> has been limited in its <mark>climate</mark>-related risk disclosure to the SEC. After pressure from UCS and investors, the company did expand its disclosure of physical risk at its refineries, but <A href=""http://blog.ucsusa.org/gretchen-goldman/<mark>chevron</mark>-exxon-phillips-66-react-to-ucs-stormy-seas-rising-risks-report-698"" target=""_blank"">didn’t explicitly mention</A> <mark>climate change</mark> like this year’s disclosure does.</LI></UL><P>In last year’s <EM><mark>Climate</mark> Accountability Scorecard</EM>, <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2016/10/<mark>climate</mark>-accountability-scorecard-<mark>chevron</mark>-fact-sheet.pdf"" target=""_blank""><mark>Chevron</mark></A> scored only “fair” on fully disclosing <mark>climate</mark> risks to its shareholders. It remains to be seen whether these additional disclosures will improve <mark>Chevron</mark>’s score in this area.</P><H3>Direct and indirect lobbying</H3><P>Growing numbers of investors are also seeking more information to assess whether lobbying by major oil and gas companies is consistent with the companies’ expressed goals and in the best interests of shareholders. <mark>Chevron</mark> again faces a proposal from shareholders requesting annual reporting on direct and indirect lobbying activities and expenditures.</P><P>In 2016, 27% of <mark>Chevron</mark> shareholders voted for such a <A href=""https://www.ceres.org/investor-network/resolutions/annually-disclose-direct-and-indirect-lobbying-2016"" target=""_blank"">proposal</A>, and the company has not taken any steps that are likely to reduce shareholder concerns in this area.</P><P>This year’s resolution cites <mark>Chevron</mark>’s lack of transparency about its membership in and contributions to trade associations and industry groups such as the <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/images/2015/07/gw-minigraphic-<mark>climate</mark>-deception-dossier-2-API-roadmap-memo.jpg"" target=""_blank"">American Petroleum Institute (API)</A>, <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/images/2015/07/gw-minigraphic-<mark>climate</mark>-deception-dossier-3-WSPA-ppt.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA)</A>, Business Roundtable, <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/fight-misinformation/whos-fighting-clean-power-plan-and-epa-action-<mark>climate</mark>#bf-toc-6"" target=""_blank"">US Chamber of Commerce (US Chamber)</A>, and <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/images/2015/07/gw-minigraphic-<mark>climate</mark>-deception-dossier-6-ALEC.jpg"" target=""_blank"">American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)</A>.</P><P>UCS’s <EM><mark>Climate</mark> Accountability Scorecard</EM> rated <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2016/10/<mark>climate</mark>-accountability-scorecard-<mark>chevron</mark>-fact-sheet.pdf"" target=""_blank""><mark>Chevron</mark></A> “egregious” in the area of Renouncing disinformation on <mark>climate</mark> science and policy, due largely to its affiliation with groups like API, WSPA, the US Chamber, and ALEC that spread disinformation on <mark>climate</mark> science and policy.</P><P>Shareholders should not tolerate <mark>Chevron</mark>’s efforts to dismiss and deny the very real risks posed by <mark>climate change</mark> to our planet, to the company’s business model, and to their investments.

      </A></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden""><DIV class=""field-items""><DIV class=""field-item even""><P>This week saw two oil companies take two very different approaches to <mark>climate change</mark>. One has recognised the impact that global efforts to cut emissions will have on its bottom line while the other denies <mark>climate</mark> action will have any adverse impact.
	I’m talking about Shell and <mark>Chevron</mark>. Both behemoths in the energy world but with drastically opposite views sitting on either side of the Atlantic.
	This week <A href=""http://www.shell.com/investors/financial-reporting/annual-publications.html#vanity-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zaGVsbC5jb20vYW5udWFscmVwb3J0"">Shell released its latest annual report</A> for the year up to December 2015. Reading through it, it quickly becomes clear that the company has started joining the dots on <mark>climate change</mark> following the <A href=""//www.desmog.co.uk/2015/12/12/historic-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-major-leap-mankind"">Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement</A> and mounting shareholder pressure.</P><P>The risk of <mark>climate change</mark> to the company is disclosed in-depth: “Rising <mark>climate change</mark> concerns have led and could lead to additional legal and/or regulatory measures which could result in project delays or cancellations, a decrease in demand for fossil fuels and additional compliance obligations, and therefore could adversely impact our costs and/or revenue.”
	It then goes on to talk about the impact increased attention to <mark>climate change</mark> across society will have on its operations, recognising that regulations on greenhouse gas emissions “will focus more on suppressing demand for fossil fuels. This could result in lower revenue.”
	This is a much clearer recognition of the risks posed by <mark>climate change</mark> to a fossil fuel company than Shell had disclosed in the past.<A href=""http://reports.shell.com/annual-report/2014/servicepages/welcome.php"">Last year</A> it stated things more simply: “Rising <mark>climate change</mark> concerns could lead to additional regulatory measures that may result in project delays and higher costs.” There was no mention of the legal risks or direct impact to the company’s profits.<STRONG>Risk Disclosure</STRONG>
	This shift in public risk disclosure is a clear recognition from Shell that policy action and legal risks are mounting. And after the past year Shell’s experienced, it’s a wise move.
	Last May, the oil company’s <A href=""//www.desmog.co.uk/2015/05/19/shell-faces-shareholder-backlash-over-arctic-drilling"">shareholders voted unanimously</A> in favour of a resolution that forced Shell to consider the possibility of a 2C world in its forecasting. Until that time Shell had been <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/17/shell-accused-of-strategy-risking-catastrophic-<mark>climate</mark>-change?CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2"">using a 4C to 6C global warming scenario</A> to guide future business operations (twice the level of warming considered safe for the planet).
	Then, in September Shell was forced to <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/28/shell-ceases-alaska-arctic-drilling-exploratory-well-oil-gas-disappoints"">abandon its plans to drill for Arctic oil</A> off the coast of Alaska citing high costs, uncertain regulatory environment, and the failure to find enough oil and gas to drill. After months of protests against Shell’s Arctic drilling, green campaigners declared this a victory for the environment.
	Finally, it’s hard to ignore the impact of the ‘Exxon knew’ campaign. Last September it was revealed that <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken"">Exxon knew that <mark>climate change</mark> was caused by humans</A> burning fossil fuels long before it went on to promote <mark>climate</mark> science denial and misinformation campaigns. Based on this, New York and California have launched investigations into the oil giant.
	And now, <A href=""http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-congress-shell-<mark>climate</mark>-change-20160218-story.html"">calls have come for a similar investigation</A> to be launched into Shell – did it also deceive the public on <mark>climate change</mark>?
	You can see how this all might push a company into acknowledging the very real financial, regulatory, and legal risks posed to it by <mark>climate change</mark>.<STRONG><mark>Chevron</mark>'s Position</STRONG>
	Meanwhile, at the other end of the spectrum <mark>Chevron</mark> is singing a different tune.
	It <A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e34575d6-e603-11e5-a09b-1f8b0d268c39.html#axzz42UQ9czMH"">told the <EM>Financial Times</EM></A> this week that the world will always need Big Oil. Rather than taking a more humble, forward-thinking approach, <mark>Chevron</mark>’s <SPAN class=""caps"">CEO</SPAN> John Watson boasted that “arguably, we’ve never been more advantaged than right now.”
	As the <EM><SPAN class=""caps"">FT</SPAN></EM>writes: “The idea that curbs on greenhouse gas emissions put the long-term viability of the oil industry at risk has been gaining ground among investors, but John Watson doubts that <mark>climate</mark> policies will be a threat to <mark>Chevron</mark>.”
	Do a quick search through <A href=""http://www.<mark>chevron</mark>.com/annualreport/2014/documents/pdf/<mark>Chevron</mark>2014AnnualReport.pdf""><mark>Chevron</mark>’s most recent annual report for 2014</A> (presumably this year’s report for 2015 is in the works) and you’ll find that the company only mentions the words ‘<mark>climate change</mark>’ once <SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;"">–</SPAN> in the context of increased regulations on greenhouse gas emissions.
	<mark>Chevron</mark>, along with Exxon, has a reputation for not engaging on <mark>climate change</mark>. While European oil majors including Shell signed a joint declaration supporting action on <mark>climate change</mark> ahead of the Paris <SPAN class=""caps"">COP21</SPAN> <mark>climate</mark> conference in December, the two American companies were noticeable in their absence. <STRONG>Public Pressure</STRONG>
	Of course, Shell still has room for improvement – I won’t be letting it off the hook that easy.
	The joint <mark>climate</mark> declaration was <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/oil-companies-deny-that-joint-<mark>climate</mark>-pledge-is-lip-service"">criticised for being little more than hot air</A> given the industry's history of actively lobbying against <mark>climate</mark> action. <SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;"">Last April </SPAN><A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/27/shell-lobbied-to-undermine-eu-renewables-targets-documents-reveal"" style=""line-height: 17.6px;"">it was revealed</A><SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;""> that Shell successfully lobbied to undermine European renewable energy targets. Instead, it argued that Europe’s transition to a low <mark>carbon</mark> energy system should focus on gas expansion.</SPAN>
	And as Shell's annual report states, its own internal forecasting assumes an average global temperature increase of 2-3C by 2100 – this is higher than the internationally agreed target of limiting warming to “well below 2C” with the aim of achieving 1.5C. 
	In fact, at <SPAN class=""caps"">COP21</SPAN> David Hone, Shell's head of <mark>climate change</mark>, <A href=""https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/adam-ramsay/gate-crashing-inner-sanctum-of-elite-at-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-talks"">told Adam Ramsay of openDemocracy</A> that oil companies don't see holding warming of the planet to two degrees as “a given”. This view is confirmed in its report, which reads: “Based on the above analysis, we believe current oil, gas and <SPAN class=""caps""><mark>CO2</mark></SPAN> prices are too low to stimulate the fossil fuel substitution necessary to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the average global temperature increase to well below 2°C.”
	But what Shell’s recent admission does is it recognises that public pressure for action on <mark>climate change</mark> is only going to keep increasing. And, it shows that this pressure is starting to be felt at the very heart of the fossil fuel industry.

This included the challenges of scientifically confirming that worldwide warming is already causing local impacts, such as sea-level rise.</P><P>Boutrous also emphasized that the five-year-old IPCC report identified population growth as a major cause in the spike of greenhouse gas emissions. “It is not (energy) production and extraction that is driving this increase, it is how people are leading their lives,” said Boutrous, a partner in the Los Angeles office of <A href=""https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/boutrous-jr-theodore-j/"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher.</A></P><P>Unlike Oakland and San Francisco, <mark>Chevron</mark> did not bring expert scientists to testify at Wednesday’s five-hour tutorial. Moreover, none of the other defendants in the case — including, BP, Exxon and other oil and coal companies — made any statements to the court.</P><P>Alsup took note of that, and issued a stern order to the other fossil fuel companies, which had lawyers quietly in attendance at the hearing. Alsup said they had a week to file any disagreements with Boutrous’s presentation. </P><P>“You can’t get away in sitting there in silence, and then say he wasn’t speaking for us,” said the judge. </P><P>Alsup, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, is known for immersing himself in technical court cases, and asking for “tutorials” from both sides. Last year, he asked lawyers for a <A href=""https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170325/23492137003/judge-alsup-wants-uber-waymo-to-teach-him-how-to-lidar-prior-to-self-driving-car-case.shtml"" target=""_blank"" title="""">tutorial on self-driving car technology</A> in a lawsuit that pits Google’s Waymo against Uber. He previously taught himself the Java programming language in deciding a lawsuit involving Oracle against Google.</P><P>At Wednesday’s ruling, the judge wore what he called his “science tie” — showing planetary constellations — and he seemed to relish asking a variety of earth science questions. He questioned Boutrous about details in Al Gore’s 2006 documentary<A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Inconvenient_Truth"" target=""_blank"" title="""">An Inconvenient Truth</A>. He also asked the lawyer about a TV show he’d recently seen about the <A href=""https://oceantoday.noaa.gov/ringoffire/"" target=""_blank"" title="""">“Ring of Fire,”</A> volcanic eruptions under the oceans that release levels of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide.</P><P>During the early part of the tutorial, Oxford scientist Myles Allen and Boutrous summarized the work of early atmospheric scientists. One of these was Svante August Arrhenius, a Swedish physicist who theorized in the 19th century that <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions from coal would be trapped in the atmosphere, and raise the earth temperature, since radiation from the earth would have less ability to escape. </P><P>Arrhenius’s findings were eventually recognized as being on target. Alsup was impressed. </P><P>“Don’t you think it’s amazing that that guy ... with just the back of an envelope with pencil and paper, could have made that projection that even today sounds pretty reasonable?” said Alsup.</P><P><mark>Chevron</mark>’s Boutrous agreed. “These scientists are brilliant,” he said.</P><P>For students of history and <mark>climate</mark> sciences, Wednesday’s hearing offered a buffet of technical insights. Allen highlighted the research of California’s Charles and Ralph Keeling, a pair of father-son scientists who over decades documented the buildup of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere, confirming predictions of earlier scientists. </P><P>Allen also made note of recent research that has qua<A href=""http://<mark>carbon</mark>majors.org/"" target=""_blank"" title="""">ntified the contribution</A> of industrial oil and gas industries to <mark>climate change</mark>s — data that is likely to surface again in future court hearings.</P><P>After Boutrous made his presentation, regarding the uncertainties listed in the 2013 IPCC report, University of Illinois scientist Don Wuebbles presented for the coastal cities. Wuebbles helped write the latest peer-reviewed U.S. report on <mark>climate change</mark>, <A href=""https://www.globalchange.gov/nca4"" target=""_blank"" title="""">the 4th U.S. <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment</A>, released earlier this year.</P><P>Wuebbles says the latest research shows ever-higher temperatures, including 2016 being the warmest year on record globally. It also warns of more intense wildfires, floods, droughts, coastal storms and other intensifed disasters.</P><P>“The science doesn’t stop at 2012,” said Wuebbles, throwing an elbow at <mark>Chevron</mark>’s presentation. </P><P>Alsup’s tutorial is a preliminary step to arguments on various legal questions of the San Francisco and Oakland lawsuits.

The unusual hearing was required by Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing lawsuits filed by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland claiming that five oil giants are contributing to damages related to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>In the hours before the tutorial, which Alsup is using to gather historical observations about climatic conditions that can go back thousands of years, <mark>Chevron</mark> said it wouldn’t question the facts around rising temperatures.</P><P>“<mark>Chevron</mark> is not going to be engaging in a debate on <mark>climate change</mark> science,” said Avi Garbow, co-chairman of the Environmental Litigation and Mass Tort Practice Group at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP and a <mark>Chevron</mark> lawyer. He’s also a former official in the Obama administration who defended the Clean Power Plan as general counsel to then-U.S. EPA chief Gina McCarthy.</P><P>The company will “anchor its presentation” on the Fifth Assessment Report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC), issued in 2014, he said on a call with reporters Monday.</P><P>“<mark>Chevron</mark>’s neither going to overstate nor understate degrees of confidence. <mark>Chevron</mark>’s simply going to present the conclusions of the IPCC because <mark>Chevron</mark> thinks that’s the best and the most accurate way of responding to the court’s tutorial request,” Garbow said.</P><P>San Francisco and Oakland, along with several counties in California, are suing <mark>Chevron</mark>, BP PLC, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC for allegedly downplaying the threat of <mark>climate change</mark>. The local governments claim that the oil majors knew years ago that the emissions related to their products could cause sea-level rise and contribute to other damages.</P><P>Earlier this month, Alsup asked the cities and oil companies to answer nine questions, including “What are the main sources of <mark>CO2</mark> that account for the incremental buildup of <mark>CO2</mark> in the atmosphere?” and “What are the main sources of heat that account for the incremental rise in temperature on Earth?”</P><P>He also asked the cities to produce documents referred to in their suits that deal with the extent to which the oil companies knew about the risks of <mark>climate change</mark>. Those documents have been submitted to the court.</P><P>Despite its open approach to the science hearing, <mark>Chevron</mark> yesterday filed a <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/assets/2018/03/20/document_gw_20.pdf"">motion</A> to dismiss the suits. So did ConocoPhillips, which claimed that the cases lack jurisdiction because it’s a Delaware company headquartered in Houston.</P><P><mark>Chevron</mark> said claims that are similar to those filed by San Francisco and Oakland have been dismissed by other courts. Its key argument is that U.S. EPA has oversight over greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>“This is not the first (or even the second or third) time a plaintiff has tried to plead global warming-related tort claims,” <mark>Chevron</mark>’s motion said. “Similar claims have been considered, and dismissed, by the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit, and district courts around the country.”</P><P>Oil companies beyond <mark>Chevron</mark> declined to say if they would make presentations at today’s hearing or defer to <mark>Chevron</mark>. A spokesman for Exxon Mobil criticized the lawsuits.</P><P>“Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions,” Scott Silvestri said in an email. “Lawsuits of this kind—filed by trial attorneys against an industry that provides products we all rely upon to power the economy and enable our domestic life—simply do not do that.”</P><P>The cities’ attorneys declined to reveal their strategies for the hearing. San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said he “looks forward to providing the objective history of <mark>climate change</mark> science and the consensus science on future impacts. It’s time for <mark>climate</mark> science to have its day in court.”</P><P>“These companies knew their products were causing sea-level rise, and they deceived people about it,” Herrera added. “Now, that bill has come due.”</P><H2>On the record</H2><P>The oil companies have no real choice but to acknowledge <mark>climate</mark> science, legal experts said.</P><P>“They realize that the science behind <mark>climate change</mark> is so well understood and accepted that it isn’t in their interest to be seen as deniers,” Ann Carlson, co-director of the Emmett Institute on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the Environment, said in an email. “Moreover, their own internal documents and research accept the validity of <mark>climate change</mark> and for several of them they’ve made public statements acknowledging the human contribution to <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>She added, “They’re really hedging their bets, instead, on the large number of contributors to <mark>climate change</mark>, the causation questions, the global nature of the problem, and the hope that they can get courts to find that federal common law (at least) displaces nuisance claims.”</P><P>On the call with reporters, <mark>Chevron</mark> attorneys said it’s not possible to pin the cause of warming on a handful of oil companies. The cities in their suits say that the consumption of fossil fuels has created harms, said Joshua Lipshutz, a partner at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher and a <mark>Chevron</mark> lawyer.</P><P>“If that’s the allegation, then really anyone in the world could be brought in in the case, including the plaintiffs themselves,” he said. “San Francisco and Oakland are large consumers of fossil fuels and large emitters of greenhouse gas emissions.”</P><P>The <mark>Chevron</mark> lawyers discounted research attempting to pinpoint sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Garbow said it’s not emphasized in the IPCC report, which is considered scientific consensus.</P><P>“It is, as far as I’m aware, a line of, if you will, scientific study or inquiry that is not very developed, and certainly not at this juncture widely accepted by any stretch,” Garbow said.</P><P>Daniel Farber, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an email that the oil companies may try to show that there was “more uncertainty until recently” in terms of <mark>climate</mark> science.</P><P>Garbow, the <mark>Chevron</mark> lawyer, noted “that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-20th century.”</P><P>Farber said showing that uncertainty existed years ago might help the companies fight accusations that they knew the risks and “were simply lying in their public statements or were completely irresponsible to oppose regulation at earlier points in time—whether it helps them enough isn’t clear to me.”</P><P>Farber said it’s noteworthy that the oil companies plan to acknowledge that <mark>climate</mark> science is accurate.</P><P>“Most or all of the major oil corporations have now acknowledged the reality of <mark>climate change</mark> and the need for government action (though who knows how serious they are about that),” he said. “So it would be hard for them to take a contrary view in this litigation. Getting them to say the same thing in court will be kind of a victory for the plaintiffs even if nothing else goes their way.”</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>wire with permission from E&amp;E News.

But, he said, that didn’t mean that a civil lawsuit was the right way to address <mark>climate change</mark>. “It’s a global issue that requires global action,” he said.</P><P id=""bQDMpU"">Over the course of two hours, Boutrous ran through the findings of <A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/"">the most recent IPCC report (released in 2013)</A>, acknowledging that global temperatures were rising due to <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide caused by human activity, that other factors were negligible, and that as a result, sea levels were rising. No time was given to any denials of <mark>climate</mark> science, with Boutrous sticking closely to the substance of the IPCC report. Even his attempt at implying that his client was not at fault was framed within the substance of the IPCC report; he said that the report never said “extraction or production” of oil was the cause of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions, but rather the “economic activity” that burned fossil fuels. </P><DIV class=""c-float-right c-float-hang""><ASIDE id=""XdkpXa""><Q>Major oil companies went on the record to say that human-caused <mark>climate change</mark> is real</Q></ASIDE></DIV><P id=""AlPob4""><A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber"">Judge William Alsup</A>, who is presiding over the lawsuit, is giving the other oil companies — ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell, and BP — a week to quibble with anything Boutrous said in court about <mark>climate change</mark>. “<mark>Chevron</mark> welcomes meaningful efforts to address the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>, but litigation is not an appropriate tool for accomplishing that objective,” Sean Comey, a spokesperson for <mark>Chevron</mark>, said in an emailed statement to <EM>The Verge</EM>. “<mark>Chevron</mark> provided a neutral assessment of the science based on the most recent comprehensive scientific assessment.” The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </P><P id=""YbIuy5"">Wednesday’s session was not a trial, or really even a hearing in the typical sense of the word. It was, in Judge Alsup’s terminology, a “tutorial” — a session in which the legal teams for both sides present background facts for his edification. It’s not discovery, it’s not evidence, and just because it was presented Wednesday, it’s not necessarily admissible for a jury in the future should this case go to trial. Nonetheless, the hearing marked a moment in which major oil companies went on the record to say that human-caused <mark>climate change</mark> is real. At this point, the science is so undeniable that it no longer makes sense for oil companies to try and refute it. </P><DIV class=""c-float-left c-float-hang""><ASIDE id=""twRP59""><Q>“Rhetorical claims don’t cut the mustard.”</Q></ASIDE></DIV><P id=""PHD2SI"">This is the first time Judge Alsup — or any judge, really — has held a <mark>climate change</mark> tutorial. These types of sessions are not typical in the legal system, but Alsup has requested tutorials in other cases in the past, including tutorials on immigration for a <A href=""https://www.vox.com/2018/1/10/16872766/daca-trump-court-ruling-renew"">DACA case</A> and LIDAR for the <EM>Waymo v. Uber</EM> case. Alsup’s approach to science has not gone unappreciated in this case. <A href=""http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/people/mallen.html"">Myles Allen</A>, a <mark>climate</mark> scientist from the University of Oxford, who presented before the judge on Wednesday, says, “The court is evidently taking our science as seriously as they’re taking the science involved in patent law cases, where the court really does have to understand the technicalities and where rhetorical claims don’t cut the mustard.” </P><P id=""0iXJ6b"">At the start of the tutorial, Alsup warned the press, “You will probably find this boring,” reiterating that this was all so “the poor judge can learn some science.” (Judge Alsup was previously an engineering major at Mississippi State, ultimately graduating with a math degree.) Although Alsup promised that “if you get bored, you can just leave,” the throng of observers that packed the gallery and an additional overflow room barely thinned through a five-hour session that started early in the morning. </P><P id=""BbGKAN"">Lawyers for the cities of San Francisco and Oakland were largely silent at the tutorial, with <A href=""https://www.hbsslaw.com/attorneys/managing-partner/steve-w-berman-managing-partner"">Steve Berman</A>, representing the San Francisco city attorney’s office, stepping up to the podium only to introduce <mark>climate</mark> scientist after <mark>climate</mark> scientist. </P><P id=""sUzHkg"">Only Boutrous spoke on the defendants’ side, not bothering to bring on any scientists to speak for the oil companies. Boutrous appeared to have studied the IPCC’s 2013 AR5 report from start to finish, and he stuck closely to what he characterized as the scientific consensus. (When it was his turn, <A href=""https://www.atmos.illinois.edu/cms/One.aspx?siteId=127458&amp;pageId=151986"">Don Weubbles</A> of the University of Illinois sniped at the limited scope of Boutrous’ presentation, saying pointedly that “science did not stop” after 2013.)</P><P id=""9mZVIz"">It became swiftly apparent that the judge was taking the opportunity to satisfy his curiosity on absolutely anything that had occurred to him, prompting Allen at one point to spread his arms out in a wobbling motion to describe the motion of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide molecules when they absorb infrared radiation. At another point, Judge Alsup and Allen went on a long, wandering detour about whether the relationship between two variables was logarithmic or linear. </P><P id=""9CiSTP"">The wide range of questions put Boutrous at a disadvantage. At one point, the judge interrupted him with a question about undersea lava flows and ocean temperatures, citing an interesting “geology show” he had seen on television a few weeks ago. Because this fell far outside the scope of any of the presentations or the IPCC report, his question went unanswered.</P><P id=""Hgl65f"">The unnamed geology show wasn’t the only kind of preparation that Alsup had made. He also mentioned that he had rewatched <EM>An Inconvenient Truth</EM>, and acknowledged that he had been reading several books on <mark>climate</mark> science and its history, even challenging Boutrous at one point about a scientist that he had left out in his rundown of the history of <mark>climate</mark> science. </P><P id=""RZzoTc"">“You jumped over 1938. Who was in 1938?” he asked the lawyer. </P><P id=""RClF1W"">“... 1938?” Boutrous asked. </P><P id=""lei3kE"">“There was a guy named <A href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-22283372"">Callendar</A>,” Alsup prompted. “The <A href=""https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springer.com%2Fla%2Fbook%2F9781935704041"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Callendar effect</A> is named after him.” </P><P id=""oA3D2w"">The science experts didn’t seem used to lecturing to a single student who is completely unabashed about asking any question that pops into his head. They occasionally had trouble indulging or recovering from tangential lines of questions, but still, they had a wider range of knowledge to draw from when put on the spot. Although Boutrous — a noted Supreme Court litigator — couldn’t answer questions about undersea lava flows or why the rise of sea water is inconsistent across the planet, he was at least at ease with a judicial style of questioning, and his strategy was clear: if the oil companies were going to go on the record with a vocal acceptance of <mark>climate</mark> science, they would take the opportunity to have a professional rhetorician sow doubt about where oil companies fit into the blame game. </P><P id=""9ZzoWG"">The thrust of Boutrous’ presentation wasn’t that <mark>climate</mark> science was wrong — he, too, took a turn running through graphs showing the precipitous rise in global temperatures and sea levels — but he also took care to show the rate of emissions in China and India, lingering particularly on a graph that said that China’s emissions currently exceed the United States. He said that this was largely due to the burning of coal, which is being reduced in the US. In fact, Boutrous even credited hydraulic fracking with reducing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions in the US. </P><P id=""7kWay5"">Boutrous seemed to say that fossil fuel companies aren’t responsible for how people use their products. “IPCC doesn’t say that the extraction or production of fossil fuels leads to emissions,” Boutrous said. “It’s energy use, the economic activity, that drives the demand for fuel that leads to emissions.” </P><DIV class=""c-float-right c-float-hang""><ASIDE id=""jaBI15""><Q>“We’re just making the cigarettes, people are choosing to smoke.”</Q></ASIDE></DIV><P id=""1nRNEu"">It’s an argument we’ve heard before from tobacco companies, says <A href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/about/staff/staff/peter-frumhoff.html#.WrL1eJPwZE4"">Peter Frumhoff</A>, chief <mark>climate</mark> scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Tobacco companies for years said that ‘We’re just making the cigarettes; people are choosing to smoke,’” Frumhoff says. And for years, courts sided with the companies, he says — until public opinion began to change. “It was the consequence of their efforts to disinform that led juries and judges — who are members of the public — to say, ‘Wait a minute,’” Frumhoff says. The lawsuit itself says bluntly that the defendants “borrowed the Big Tobacco playbook in order to promote their products.” The complaint accuses the oil companies of “promoting massive use of fossil fuels by misleading the public about global warming by emphasizing the uncertainties of <mark>climate</mark> science.” </P><P id=""xwPvRW"">In response, Boutrous’ presentation on the history of <mark>climate</mark> science focused on the controversy around the theory that <mark>climate change</mark> was caused by humans. <mark>Chevron</mark> may be willing to say <EM>now </EM>that <mark>climate change</mark> was caused by humans, but surely it wasn’t wrong to say otherwise <EM>then</EM>. For example, both Boutrous and Allen mentioned Swedish chemist <A href=""https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Arrhenius/"">Svante Arrhenius</A> who, at the turn of the 20th century, grew increasingly concerned that anthropogenic <mark>carbon</mark> emissions could increase global temperatures. </P><P id=""uVBCze"">But Boutrous took time to emphasize that, until about the 1960s, most scientists didn’t believe him. This isn’t strictly <EM>wrong</EM> — although Judge Alsup himself noted that in 1938, <A href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-22283372"">Guy Callendar</A> linked <mark>climate change</mark> to anthropogenic <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions. Even <A href=""https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Arrhenius/"">NASA’s Earth Observatory</A> agrees that Arrhenius was largely disregarded until the second half of the century. “It’s trial and error. Scientists debating each other,” Boutrous said in court. “Questioning other scientists’ views is part of the scientific process.” (Boutrous did not call any scientific experts on behalf of the oil companies to speak before Judge Alsup Wednesday about how the scientific process is conducted or anything else.) </P><DIV class=""c-float-left c-float-hang""><ASIDE id=""nxGjzN""><Q>“What’s actually said is not nearly as important as what the evidence is to support it.” </Q></ASIDE></DIV><P id=""ItbI3K"">Boutrous drew quotes from IPCC reports across the years, showing the increasingly strong language that was used to characterize its conclusions about <mark>climate change</mark>. In 1995, the IPCC said that “the balance of evidence suggests” human-caused <mark>climate change</mark>, the 2007 report goes with the phrase “very likely,” and by 2013, it becomes “extremely likely.”In other words, the oil companies are emphasizing that it’s taken time for scientists to reach a consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>. It’s a strategy that <mark>climate</mark> law expert <A href=""http://columbia<mark>climate</mark>law.com/about-us/our-team/jessica-wentz/"">Jessica Wentz</A> at Columbia Law School was expecting. “Not directly attacking the science, but undermining it by emphasizing uncertainty,” she says.</P><P id=""NFNz7E"">The legalistic reading of the IPCC’s statements was frustrating to Allen, he said in an interview with <EM>The Verge </EM>after the tutorial concluded, because to scientists, the evidence and context are more important than the language. “The question of whether somebody writing a scientific paper uses the word ‘likely’ or ‘very likely’ is kind of neither here nor there,” Allen says. “What’s actually said is not nearly as important as what the evidence is to support it.” </P><P id=""q72IlX"">Still, on the basic facts, the two sides agreed more than they disagreed — which kept arguments over whether or not <mark>climate change</mark> was real from derailing the hearing.

And what we learned from the tutorial is that these companies are likely to use the agreed-upon science to make the case that they shouldn’t have to pay for the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P id=""JNGS92"">If the cities’ lawsuit survives a barrage of motions to dismiss, they will still have to show that oil majors deliberately sowed confusion on <mark>climate change</mark> in bad faith.Let’s walk through what we know about the various arguments so far. </P><H3 id=""9FFvBv"">Oil companies agree on the science but not the politics</H3><P id=""AWIkgM"">The fundamental argument from the oil companies is that <mark>climate change</mark> is a global problem that needs a political solution, and you can’t solve a political problem in court and you certainly can’t blame the oil companies for selling a product that everyone wants to buy. </P><P id=""BDk4p1"">Theodore Boutrous, a <A href=""https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/boutrous-jr-theodore-j/"">seasoned litigator</A> who’s argued cases before the US Supreme Court, presented on behalf of <mark>Chevron</mark>. “<mark>Chevron</mark> accepts the consensus in the scientific communities on <mark>climate change</mark>,” he said last week. “There’s no debate about <mark>climate</mark> science.”</P><P id=""hZydq0"">He built his presentation around the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>’s <A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/"">fifth assessment report</A>, published in 2013, which has more than 800 authors and cites more than 9,200 scientific papers (he also rewatched <A href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/""><EM>An Inconvenient Truth</EM></A>). The report states that the IPCC is “95 percent certain that humans are the main cause of current global warming” and remains one of the most robust works in <mark>climate</mark> science. </P><P id=""VqGdix"">But as Boutrous detailed the history of how <mark>climate</mark> scientists like Svante Arrhenius and John Tyndall developed their theories, he also noted that previous IPCC reports weren’t always so certain. The 1990 report said that “the observed increase could be largely due to natural variability.” The 1995 report said that signals were emerging that there is human influence on the <mark>climate</mark>. The 2001 report said that warming was “very unlikely” due to natural causes alone. </P><P id=""biLlp4"">The point he was making was that the consensus took time to build, and as the science got better, <mark>Chevron</mark> moved with it. Past rhetoric from oil companies reflected this uncertainty in the science, and <mark>Chevron</mark> now has a <A href=""https://www.<mark>chevron</mark>.com/corporate-responsibility/<mark>climate</mark>-change"">comprehensive strategy</A> for managing <mark>climate</mark> risks, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions. </P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION><mark>Chevron</mark>’s El Segundo Refinery covers approximately 1,000 acres with more than 1,100 miles of pipelines and is capable of refining nearly 270,000 barrels of crude oil per day.</FIGCAPTION><CITE>David McNew/Getty Images</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""H1Zi51"">Another key point Boutrous made was that these human-sourced greenhouse gas emissions are due to growing wealth and development, of which fossil fuel combustion is a symptom, not a cause. “Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever,” the IPCC reported in <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/news_and_events/docs/ar5/ar5_syr_headlines_en.pdf"">2014</A>. </P><P id=""X2JhZ3"">“It’s just a facet of human existence,” Boutrous told Vox. “It’s an issue for policymakers to address.”</P><P id=""Hx9n7I"">And looking toward the future, it’s unclear how <mark>climate change</mark> will impact San Francisco and Oakland in particular. San Francisco, in its complaint, included a map showing water inundation for the city with 66 inches of sea level rise plus 42 inches of flooding from a <A href=""https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/28/16211392/100-500-year-flood-meaning"">100-year storm</A>, a scenario they called “unlikely, but possible.”</P><P id=""XkjoUu"">Boutrous pointed out that while global sea levels are rising on average, some evidence shows that sea levels have fallen in specific regions, and coastal flooding in places like the San Francisco Bay Area is also a function of local conditions like <A href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180307141411.htm"">land subsidence</A>. </P><P id=""6ChfQj"">So for San Francisco and Oakland to build a claim on harms from future sea level rise is a stretch when there is so much uncertainty as to what will happen, the argument goes.</P><P id=""ke9AHk"">Boutrous noted that when the judge asked the scientists in the room if they disagreed with what he presented, they didn’t question his reading of the facts. </P><P id=""JqqmAq"">That signals that progress in these lawsuits isn’t going to hinge on the science so much as an untested legal theory, and that’s where the plaintiffs are on weak footing, according to Boutrous. Holding oil companies liable for producing fossil fuels would also open up cities to liability for building roads and facilitating travel with vehicles that burn those fuels. </P><P id=""0SeikJ"">“Focusing resources on a novel, never-accepted theory just isn’t the way to have a productive chance at really addressing global warming,” Boutrous said. “No tort theory has ever been developed that comes close to covering these issues.” </P><H3 id=""1FjVuh"">The <mark>climate</mark> models have gotten better; the news has gotten worse </H3><P id=""x1ezhd"">But Donald Wuebbles, an author of the 2013 IPCC report as well as the 2017 <A href=""https://science2017.globalchange.gov/"">National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment</A> produced by 13 US federal agencies, noted that while the last IPCC report may be the biggest work in <mark>climate</mark> science, it only incorporated research published as of 2012. </P><P id=""FQVBDN"">“I started up my talk saying that the science didn’t stop in 2012,” Wuebbles, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois, told Vox. “The reality is these assessments are very conservative in their statements.”</P><P id=""bLVr1X"">His end of the tutorial focused on the changes we can anticipate as average temperatures go up around the world, noting that models have become more robust and that scientists are zeroing in on the harms that will be caused by unmitigated changes to the global <mark>climate</mark>. Judge Alsup also asked him about policy questions like which energy sources the United States can use if it gives up coal, oil, and natural gas.</P><P id=""RZz3ub"">The other four defendants had representatives in the room but declined to present, which San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera read as a signal that the other oil companies did not even want to recognize that the court has jurisdiction in such a case. </P><P id=""WstLvp"">But Alsup didn’t let the other oil companies off the hook, as Debra Kahn of <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/2018/03/22/stories/1060077139"">E&amp;E News</A> noted:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P id=""ak4Jix"">Alsup ordered the other defendants in the suit — BP PLC, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, all of which had representatives at the hearing — to submit briefs within two weeks detailing any points of disagreement with <mark>Chevron</mark>. “Otherwise, I’m going to assume you’re in agreement,” he said. “You can’t get away with sitting there in silence and then later say, ‘He wasn’t speaking for us.’”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P id=""BtoyKV"">For its part, San Francisco counted the tutorial as a win.</P><P id=""ZOYPmx"">“What we saw today was one oil company begrudgingly accept the scientific consensus while trying to overemphasize the extent of scientific uncertainty,” Herrera said in a statement. “It’s time for them to pay for the seawalls and other infrastructure needed to protect San Francisco and Oakland.”</P><P id=""57ak9s"">The legal maneuvering in this case will continue, and the litigation will likely take <A href=""https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Should-oil-companies-pay-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change-Yes-12768553.php"">years</A> to resolve. Yet the fact that the lawsuits were allowed to proceed this far and that the judge has cemented the science in the courtroom means that the foundation for <mark>climate change</mark> litigation is the strongest it’s ever been. The question for the court is whether it’s strong enough to bill an oil company for a levee.</P><P id=""UOaJ2N"">UCLA’s Carlson said that the defendants will continue to file motions to dismiss the case citing different arguments — that the court doesn’t have jurisdiction in such a case, for instance, or that the defendants don’t have standing, or that federal law doesn’t provide any recourse in such a lawsuit. If none of those motions finds traction in the court, then four to six months from now, the cases move to the discovery phase, where the defendants will have to start producing documents and providing evidence. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

There, studies like the one published last week may be powerful evidence.</P><P>“We’re seeing a lot of litigation around <mark>climate change</mark> and environmental issues now because the government is walking away from its obligation to protect human health and welfare,” said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Law at Columbia University in New York. “This (new report) is exactly the sort of study that plaintiffs will rely on in seeking to attribute blame for <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>So far, the legal effort to address global warming has focused primarily on getting regulators to do more. But lawsuits filed this summer by Marin County, San Mateo County and the Southern California city of Imperial Beach (San Diego County) target oil companies directly.</P><P>In the closely watched case, the three communities are suing 37 fossil-fuel producers over damage they say is caused by rising seas.</P><P>The new report is authored by a group of researchers connected through the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit advocacy group. San Mateo County attorney John Beiers called the report, which suggests that the 90 companies responsible for increasing temperatures are behind 30 percent of sea-level rise, an “important peer-reviewed study that confirms key elements” of his lawsuit.</P><P>Some legal experts said the study could also bolster high-stakes investigations led by attorneys general in New York and Massachusetts over ExxonMobil’s contribution to global warming. The issue there is whether the company misled investors about the damage it was doing.</P><P>Neither ExxonMobile nor <mark>Chevron</mark> responded Tuesday to requests for comment. The science of attributing <mark>climate change</mark> to specific companies remains young, and critics of the latest report have said the methodology is simplistic and the conclusions riddled with error. Another difficult question is how much responsibility consumers bear for using products and services they know contribute to global warming.</P><P>The study built on a 2013 report that estimated 90 companies were responsible for nearly two-thirds of greenhouse gas emissions. Using similar models that quantify the amount of heat-trapping gas released through the extraction and development of fossil fuels, the study attributed levels of emissions to individual companies. The new study goes a step further, calculating how much a company’s emissions contributed to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The biggest culprits, it said, were in the business of oil, gas and coal, many with household names, while a few were cement manufacturers. Investor-owned <mark>Chevron</mark>, ExxonMobil, BP and Shell were each said to be responsible for 2 to 3 percent of increasing temperatures and sea-level rise between 1880 and 2010. State-owned companies in Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Kingdom posted similar numbers.</P><P>Peter Frumhoff, one of the study’s authors and the chief <mark>climate</mark> scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the findings on emissions provide evidence needed to begin going after those behind global warming.</P><P>“We can put a number on the contribution to <mark>climate change</mark> on specific companies,” he said. “That’s been a missing link in the conversation about responsibility, including legal responsibility.”</P><P>With hurricanes Harvey and Irma causing tens of billions of dollars in damages this month, and one of the worst wildfire seasons causing hundreds of millions in losses in the West, Frumhoff predicted an uptick in such lawsuits, especially with federal regulators sitting on the sidelines. While identifying exactly how much global warming contributed to each of these disasters remains difficult, there’s consensus among scientists that warming raised the probability the events would occur and worsened the blow.</P><P>“The costs of <mark>climate change</mark> are enormous and growing,” Frumhoff said. “It seems to me that it’s appropriate for decision-makers at all levels to determine whether there are actionable steps, as were taken against tobacco, asbestos and lead companies.”</P><P>Burger, at Columbia University, cautioned that fighting for government regulators to take action on greenhouse gas emissions remains imperative. The science showing the benefit of regulating the gases is unequivocal.</P><P>“The role of the science in litigation is not going to get ferreted out for years,” Burger said. “Why isn’t the existing science moving the government to take direct action? That seems to be the primary problem.”</P><P><EM>Kurtis Alexander is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

The judge is expected to hear that motion at a hearing next month, after digesting Wednesday’s tutorial.</P><P>San Francisco and Oakland are among a number of coastal cities suing big oil over rising sea levels, which could have a major impact on them in the future. San Francisco, for instance, faces expenses of hundreds of millions of dollars to strengthen its defenses against seawater intrusion.</P><P>Alsup, an inquisitive and sometimes idiosyncratic judge appointed by former President Bill Clinton, has a reputation of inviting litigants to school him with “tutorials” on highly technical cases. Last year, <A href=""https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170325/23492137003/judge-alsup-wants-uber-waymo-to-teach-him-how-to-lidar-prior-to-self-driving-car-case.shtml"" target=""_blank"" title="""">he asked lawyers for a tutorial </A>on self-driving car technology in a lawsuit that pits Google’s Waymo against Uber. He previously <A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber"" target=""_blank"" title="""">taught himself the Java programming </A>language in deciding a lawsuit involving Oracle against Google. </P><P>Legal experts, including those for <mark>Chevron</mark>, say they’ve never previously heard of a court-ordered tutorial on <mark>climate change</mark>. “I’m not aware of a similar type of tutorial setup,” said Garbow, a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher. </P><P>Alsup wants to the two sides to answer <A href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180306_docket-317-cv-06011_order.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title="""">eight questions about the history of <mark>climate change</mark></A>, and how <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and other greenhouse gases interact in the atmosphere. These questions range from the melt-off from previous ice ages to: “What are the main sources of heat that account for the incremental rise in temperature on Earth?”</P><P>Each side will have 60 minutes each to present material on the history of <mark>climate change</mark> science, and then another 60 minutes each to present on the best <mark>climate</mark> science currently available. But it will not be an evidentiary hearing, with both sides grilling each other. Only the judge will ask questions.</P><P>Why Alsup scheduled this tutorial before hearing motions to dismiss is not entirely clear. Supporters of the lawsuits say it suggests he sees merit in arguments by Oakland and San Francisco. The two cites contend the fossil fuel industry long knew about the potential consequences of its actions, but worked to block regulations and spread doubt about the emerging <mark>climate change</mark> science.</P><P>Lawyers for the oil and coal industries contend their earlier doubts about <mark>climate change</mark> merely reflected the uncertainty of the time. They also argue that they can’t be held liable for emissions that were regulated by the EPA under the Clean Air Act, as judges have ruled in previous <mark>climate change</mark> cases.</P><P>Wednesday’s tutorial has drawn wide attention, and the U.S. District Court in San Francisco has set up an overflow room with a video feed to accommodate observers wanting to monitor the hearing. </P><P>Gavin Schmidt, a <mark>climate</mark> modeler at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, ha<A href=""https://twitter.com/<mark>Climate</mark>OfGavin/status/973016125419278336"" target=""_blank"" title="""">s been using Twitter</A> as a crowd-sourcing site for scientists and others to offer answers to Alsup’s eight questions.</P><P><mark>Climate</mark> science doubters have also gotten involved. On Friday, Willie Soon, an astrophysicist affiliated with the <A href=""https://www.heartland.org/"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Heartland Institute</A>, filed a brief in Alsup’s court stating that “there is no consensus” that recent global warming is caused largely by human activity, a claim contradicted by reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>. </P><P>Such amicus briefs may be of little help to the oil companies, given that the Heartland Institute is one of the groups that Exxon <A href=""https://exxonsecrets.org/html/orgfactsheet.php?id=41"" target=""_blank"" title="""">allegedly funded with hundreds of thousands of dollars </A>to spread doubts about the prevailing science. That funding is one focus of the ongoing lawsuit.</P><P>San Francisco and Oakland are among several California coastal cities and counties that have sued fossil fuel industries over <mark>climate change</mark> impacts. Those suits have triggered a blowback by Exxon, <A href=""http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article203207749.html"" target=""_blank"" title="""">which has countersued</A> the cities in a Texas court. </P><P>Santa Cruz city and county is leading one of the lawsuits. Another has been filed by Imperial Beach and Marin and San Mateo counties. In the latter litigation, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria is expected to decide soon if the case should be remanded back to state court. If that happens, it would be a setback for the oil companies, since California has established case law on industrial “nuisance claims,” unlike the federal courts. </P><P>There is also a <mark>climate change</mark> lawsuit <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/03/07/the-trump-administration-just-failed-to-stop-a-<mark>climate</mark>-lawsuit-brought-by-21-kids/?utm_term=.44a39eb853a8"" target=""_blank"" title="""">filed by 21 children</A> against the federal government, contending the government violated their constitutional rights by promoting usage of fossil fuels. That lawsuit is still ongoing. Earlier this month, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the Justice Department’s motion to halt the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Oregon. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

It also believes people cause it by burning <mark>carbon</mark>-based fuel—the kind <mark>Chevron</mark> extracts from the ground, refines, and sells. In fact, <mark>Chevron</mark> believes all this so hard that today its lawyer said so, in a federal court in San Francisco. Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>? Yup. They’re right.</P><P>That’s not as up-is-down as it might sound; <mark>Chevron</mark> representatives have said as much before. The follow-up questions, though, will be the tricky part. Because what was at stake in that courtroom was not whether the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>—sea level rise, ocean acidification, weather extremes, wildfires, disease outbreaks—are <EM>people’s</EM> fault. It was whether a lawsuit could show that specific effects (floods) are <EM>specific</EM> people’s fault. Specifically, the people at <mark>Chevron</mark>.</P><P class=""paywall"">...and BP and ExxonMobil, because San Francisco and Oakland are <A href=""https://www.wired.com/story/could-san-francisco-get-the-oil-industry-to-pay-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">suing</A> those companies for money to build seawalls and other protective infrastructure. The idea isn’t just that petrochemical transnationals extract, produce, and sell the fuel that puts <mark>carbon</mark> into the atmosphere. It’s that they <EM>knew</EM> that was bad, kept doing it anyway, and cut ads and marketing that tried to convince people it wasn’t a problem.</P><P class=""paywall"">But before they could really dig into that, the judge in the case, William Alsup, asked for what he termed a “tutorial.” On March 6, he sent the lawyers on both sides a <A href=""https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:2017cv06011/318403/138"" target=""_blank"">list of nine questions</A> digging into the basic history and science of <mark>climate change</mark> (Number two: What is the molecular difference by which CO<SUB>2</SUB> absorbs infrared radiation but oxygen and nitrogen do not?), with a special eye on sea level rise. Which is as odd as it sounds.</P><DIV class=""inset-left-component paywall""><H4 name=""inset-left"" class=""inset-left-component__el"">LEARN MORE</H4><H5 name=""inset-left"" class=""inset-left-component__el"">The WIRED Guide to <A href=""https://www.wired.com/story/guide-<mark>climate</mark>-change/?mbid=GuideCarveLeft""><mark>Climate Change</mark></A></H5></DIV><P class=""paywall"">Outside the usual procedural kabuki of the courtroom, the truth is no one really knew what to expect from this court-ordered “tutorial.” For a culture based in large measure on precedent, putting counsel and experts in a room to hash out <mark>climate change</mark> for a trial—putting everyone on the record, in federal court, on what is and is not true about <mark>climate</mark> science—was literally unprecedented.</P><P class=""paywall"">What Alsup got might not have been a full on PowerPoint-powered preview of the trial. But it did reveal a lot about the styles and conflicts inherent in the people who produce the <mark>carbon</mark> and the people who study it.</P><P class=""paywall"">The other petrochemists put forth Theodore Boutrous, an AC-130 gunship of a lawyer who among other things got the US Supreme Court to overturn the California law against same-sex marriage. Here, retained specifically by <mark>Chevron</mark>, Boutrous argued what seemed to be <mark>climate change</mark>’s chapter-and-verse. He extolled the virtues of the several IPCC reports, 2013 most recently, and quoted them liberally. Boutrous talked about how the reports’ conclusions have gotten more and more surefooted about “anthropogenic” causes of <mark>climate change</mark>—it’s people!—and outcomes like sea level rise. “From <mark>Chevron</mark>’s perspective, there’s no debate about <mark>climate</mark> science,” Boutrous said. “<mark>Chevron</mark> accepts what this scientific body—scientists and others—what the IPCC has reached consensus on.”</P><P class=""paywall"">Still, over the course of the morning, Boutrous nevertheless tried to neg the IPCC in two specific ways. One was a classic: He challenged the models that <mark>climate</mark> scientists use to attempt to predict the future. These computer models, Boutrous said, are  “increasingly complex. That can make the modeling more powerful.” But with great power comes great potential wrongness. “Because it’s an attempt to represent things in the real world, the complexity can bring more risk.” He assured the court that <mark>Chevron</mark> agreed with the IPCC approach—posting up a slide pulled from an IPCC report that showed the multicolored paths of literally hundreds of models, using different emissions scenarios and essentially describing the best case and worst case (and a bunch of in-between cases). It looked like a blast of fireworks emerging from observed average temperature, headed chaotically up and to the right.</P><P class=""paywall"">So here comes the crux of the thing—a question not of whether <mark>climate change</mark> is real, but whether you can ascribe blame for it. Leaning heavily on more IPCC quotes, Boutrous showed slides and statistics saying that <mark>climate change</mark> is a global problem that doesn’t differentially affect the West Coast of North America and isn’t caused by any one emitter. Or even any one source of emissions. Anthropogenic emissions are driven by things like population size, economic activities, lifestyle, energy use, land use patterns, and technology and <mark>climate policy</mark>, according to the IPCC. “The IPCC does not say it’s the extraction and production of oil,” Boutrous said. “It’s economic activity that creates the demand for energy and that leads to emissions.”</P><P class=""paywall"">If that seems a little bit like the “guns don’t kill people; people kill people” of petrochemical capitalism, well, Judge Alsup did start the morning by saying today was a day for science, not politics.</P><P class=""paywall"">So what knives did the representatives of the state of California bring to this oil-fight? Here’s where style is interesting. California didn’t front lawyers. For the science tutorial, the municipalities fronted scientists—people who’d been first authors on chapters in the IPCC reports from which Boutrous quoted, and one who’d written a more recent US report and a study of sea level rise in California. They knew their stuff and could answer all of Judge Alsup’s questions … but their presentations were more like science conference fodder than well-designed rhetoric.</P><P class=""paywall"">For example, <A href=""http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/people/mallen.html"" target=""_blank"">Myles Allen</A>, leader of the <mark>Climate</mark> Research Program at the University of Oxford, gave a detailed, densely-illustrated talk on the history and science of <mark>climate change</mark>...but he also ended up in an extended back and forth with Alsup about whether Svante Arrhenius’ 1896 paper hypothesizing that <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere warmed the planet explicitly used the world “logarithmic.&quot;<A href=""https://www.atmos.illinois.edu/cms/One.aspx?siteId=127458&amp;pageId=151986"" target=""_blank"">Donald Wuebbles</A>, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Illinois and co-author of the Nobel Prize-winning 2007 IPCC report, mounted a grim litany of all the effects scientists can see, today, of <mark>climate</mark>, but Alsup caught him up asking for specific things he disagreed with Boutrous on—a tough game since Boutrous was just quoting the IPCC.</P><P class=""paywall"">Then Alsup and Wuebbles took a detour into naming other renewable power sources besides solar and wind. “Nuclear would not put out any CO<SUB>2</SUB>, right? We might get some radiation as we drive by, but maybe in retrospect we should have taken a hard look at nuclear?” Alsup interrupted. “No doubt solar is good where you can use it, but do you really think it could be a substitute for supplying the amount of power America used in the last 30 years?”</P><P class=""paywall"">“I think solar could be a significant factor of our energy future,” Wuebbles said. “I don’t think there’s any one silver bullet.”</P><P class=""paywall"">In part, one might be tempted to put some blame on Alsup here. You might remember him from such trials as <A href=""https://www.wired.com/story/waymo-uber-trial-kalanick-testimony/"">Uber v. Waymo</A>, where he asked for a similar tutorial on self-driving car technology. Or from Oracle v. Google, a trial for which Alsup <A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber"" target=""_blank"">taught himself a little of the programming language Java</A> so he’d understand the case better. Or from his <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-daca/days-before-scotus-meets-on-daca-petition-new-injunction-complicates-debate-idUSKCN1FY32B"" target=""_blank"">intercession</A> against the Trump administration’s attempt to cancel the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, protecting the immigration status of so-called Dreamers. “He’s kind of quirky and not reluctant to do things kind of outside the box,” said <A href=""https://law.stanford.edu/directory/deborah-a-sivas/"" target=""_blank"">Deborah Sivas</A>, Director of the Environmental and Natural Resource Law &amp; Policy Program at Stanford Law School. “And I think he sees this as a precedent-setting case, as do the lawyers.”</P><P class=""paywall"">It’s possible, then, to infer that Alsup was doing more than just getting up to speed on <mark>climate change</mark> on Wednesday. The physics and chemistry are quite literally textbook, and throughout the presentations he often seemed to know more than he was letting on. He challenged chart after chart incisively, and often cut in on history. When Allen brought up Roger Revelle’s work showing that oceans couldn’t absorb <mark>carbon</mark>—at least, not fast enough to stave off <mark>climate change</mark>, Alsup interrupted.</P><P class=""paywall"">“Is it true that Revelle initially thought the ocean would absorb all the excess, and that he came to this buffer theory a little later?” Alsup asked.</P><P class=""paywall"">“You may know more of this history than I do,” Allen said.</P><P class=""paywall"">But on the other hand, some of what the litigators seemed to not know sent the scientists in the back in literal spasms. When Boutrous couldn’t answer Alsup’s questions about the specific causes of early 20th-century warming (presumably before the big industrial buildup of the 1950s), Allen and Wuebbles, sitting just outside the gallery, clenched fists and looked like they were having to keep from shouting out the answer. Later, Alsup acknowledged that he’d watched <EM>An Inconvenient Truth</EM> to prepare, and Boutrous said he had, too.</P><P class=""paywall"">All of which makes it hard to tell whether bringing scientists to this table was the right move. And maybe that has been the problem all along. The interface where utterly flexible law and policy moves against the more rigid statistical uncertainties of scientific observation has always been contested space. The practitioners of both arts seem foreign to each other; the cultural mores differ.</P><P class=""paywall"">Maybe that’s what this “tutorial” was meant for. As Sivas says, the facts aren’t really in doubt here. Or rather, most of them aren’t, and maybe Alsup will use today as a kind of discovery process, a way to crystalize the difference between uncertainty in science and uncertainty under the law. “That’s what judges do. They decide the credibility of one expert over another,” Sivas says. “That doesn’t mean it’s scientific truth. It means it’s true as a legal claim.”</P><P class=""paywall"">Now things might get even more real. If a court attaches culpability for sea level rise in California to petrochemical companies, that might establish causation for a planet’s worth of damage, any disaster someone can plausibly connect to <mark>climate change</mark>. That’s wildfires, drought, more intense hurricanes. Attribute it to <mark>climate</mark>, and it could attribute all the way to fossil fuel companies’ bank accounts.</P><H3 class=""paywall"">Our Warming <mark>Climate</mark></H3><UL class=""paywall""><LI>Predicting the degree of global warming the Earth will see has always been a matter of probabilities, but scientists think they've <A href=""https://www.wired.com/story/the-dizzying-science-of-<mark>climate</mark>-change-gets-a-bit-clearer/?mbid=BottomRelatedStories"">reduced the uncertainty</A> of their models.</LI><LI>Is Cape Town <A href=""https://www.wired.com/story/cape-town-sets-out-to-de-salt-the-sea/?mbid=BottomRelatedStories"">thirsty enough</A> to drink seawater?

The question is who's responsible and who should pay the costs,&quot; said Brenda Ekwurzel, the lead author of the paper and director of <mark>climate</mark> science at the Union of Concerned Scientists. &quot;In the United States, taxpayers are footing the bill entirely. So maybe with numbers like this you can put in the mix the producers.&quot;</P><P>In July, three local governments in California <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/18072017/oil-gas-coal-companies-exxon-shell-sued-coastal-california-city-counties-sea-level-rise"">sued a group of oil and gas</A> companies, arguing that executives knew for decades that the &quot;greenhouse gas <mark>pollution</mark> from their fossil fuel products had a significant impact on the Earth's <mark>climate</mark> and sea levels.&quot;</P><P>The state attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts, meanwhile, are investigating whether Exxon misled investors about its risks from <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Exxon and <mark>Chevron</mark> did not respond to requests for comment for this article. The American Petroleum Institute declined to comment.</P><P>Ekwurzel said the paper is only a first step for trying to sort out who is responsible for what as the costs of <mark>climate change</mark> grow. &quot;We can calculate these numbers, and we don't expect them to directly equal responsibility,&quot; she said. &quot;That's really for juries, policymakers, civil society conversation going forward.&quot;</P><P>Generally, state efforts to cap greenhouse gas emissions, such as California's cap-and-trade system, hold companies accountable only for their direct emissions. But just because it's fossil fuel consumers like power plants and drivers who ultimately burn the coal, oil and gas that emit greenhouse gases, that doesn't let the producers off the hook, she added.</P><P>&quot;A common complaint is, what about utilities, what about car-driving,&quot; Ekwurzel said. &quot;The thing is, is it the activities or is it how we've chosen to power those activities? We know there are other ways to move through space or to turn on the lights that don't rely as much on fossil fuels.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""tagged-with""><LABEL>Published Under:</LABEL></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In federal court here Wednesday, though, the gloves stayed on: Leading <mark>climate change</mark> experts and oil industry representatives largely agreed our planet is warming, our seas rising.</P><P>“You have counsel for fossil fuel companies on the record conceding the fundamentals of <mark>climate change</mark>,” said Jessica Wentz, a lawyer with the Sabin Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Law at Columbia University who watched the unusual hearing. “It could be the first time such a clear admission” that sea-level rise is linked to human activity was presented in a court setting, she said.</P><P>Climatologists in the U.S. and England offered their views in a first-of-its kind hearing before U.S. District Judge William Alsup, during which an attorney for <mark>Chevron</mark> acknowledged that human activities are contributing to sea-level rise and our warming planet.</P><P>San Francisco, Oakland and other cities and counties have filed lawsuits against <mark>Chevron</mark>, Exxon, Shell, BP and Conoco Phillips to recover costs associated with adapting to <mark>climate change</mark>. Alsup called for the four-hour “tutorial” on <mark>climate</mark> science “so the poor judge can learn some science” before the suits filed last year go any further, he said.</P><P>So on Wednesday, attorneys for San Francisco and Oakland brought in experts from UC Santa Cruz, the University of Illinois and Oxford University to explain <mark>climate</mark> science to Alsup. An attorney for <mark>Chevron</mark> spoke on behalf of the five big oil companies listed as defendants in the lawsuit.</P><P>At the start, Alsup insisted the “tutorial” was not a traditional hearing — no one was under oath and no one other than the judge could ask questions, making it more of a fact-finding mission. The attorneys and experts were tasked with explaining to Alsup the history of <mark>climate</mark> science, from long-ago ice ages to modern scientific studies, and their presentations were technical, not political.</P><P>The lawsuits seek to recover costs to pay for sea walls and other shoreline defenses to protect against rising sea levels that could inundate airport runways, roads and coastal homes and businesses. They also accuse the oil companies of hiding for decades that they knew fossil fuel use contributed to global warming and sea level rise.</P><P>In addition to Oakland and San Francisco, Richmond, Santa Cruz and the counties of Marin, San Mateo and Santa Cruz have filed similar lawsuits against oil and gas companies.</P><P>Myles R. Allen, an Oxford University professor of Geosystem Science, outlined the early history and research regarding <mark>climate</mark> science. Next, Gary Griggs, professor of earth sciences at UC Santa Cruz, showed slides of what sea-level rise will mean for Oakland International Airport, which sits on landfill. Even an extra one foot of water would be detrimental to the airport and bayfront areas of the East and South Bay, he said. Finally, Don Wuebbles, a leading expert from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s Department of Atmospheric Science, pointed to the increasing trends in California wildfires, which are bigger and burning hotter than ever before, he said. Wuebbles is also a co-author of the “<mark>Climate</mark> Science Special Report,” which he called the most comprehensive report of its kind ever presented to U.S. residents.</P><P>“Our <mark>climate</mark> is changing, it’s changing very rapidly, and it’s happening now,” Wuebbles said. “About 10 times faster than any other changes we’ve seen since the end of the last ice age.”</P><P>While Alsup pointed out that <mark>Chevron</mark>’s attorney and the experts speaking for the plaintiffs largely agreed, Wentz said the oil companies’ attorney, Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., placed emphasis on the uncertainty of <mark>climate</mark> science.</P><P>After the tutorial, Boutrous said <mark>climate change</mark> should be decided as a policy matter.</P><P>“The key argument we made is you can’t resolve issues like this in court,” Boutrous said. “You can’t resolve these sorts of global issues in one case.”</P><P>In similar cases, judges have tended to agree that the court is not the proper place to decide on “public nuisance” lawsuits related to <mark>climate change</mark>. <mark>Chevron</mark> on Tuesday filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit; Alsup is expected to rule on that motion next month.</P><P>San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera called the presentations “telling” and said that no credible scientist disputes global warming. Herrera was returning from an out-of-town trip Wednesday, so senior attorneys from his office appeared on his behalf, along with Oakland City Attorney Barbara Parker.</P><P>“It’s time for these oil companies to acknowledge what they’ve tried to hide from the public for years. Our planet is warming, and the scientific consensus is clear,” Herrera said in a statement.</P><P>He added, “What we saw today was one oil company begrudgingly accepting the scientific consensus while trying to overemphasize the extent of scientific uncertainty.”</P></DIV></DIV><FOOTER class=""article-footer""><DIV class=""footer-meta""><DIV class=""footer-meta-content""><DIV class=""tags""><UL><LI>Tags: </LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It is about whether a court like this one is the right way to deal with it.”</P><P>Tutorial sessions are occasionally used by judges to gain background on scientifically or technologically complex cases. For this session, Alsup asked for information about the history of scientific study of <mark>climate change</mark> and current science on global warming and sea level rise. He gave each side two hours. </P><P>Boutrous said <mark>Chevron</mark> is relying on a 2013 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, an international agency that synthesizes research by hundreds of scientists.</P><P>He said <mark>Chevron</mark> accepts the report’s conclusion that “It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.”</P><P>But Boutrous sought to emphasize parts of the IPCC report and other reports that showed uncertainty in predicting the extent of future temperature and sea-level increases.</P><P>In one example, Boutrous showed a 2017 state of California report that showed a 96 percent chance of a rise of one foot in the sea level at the Golden Gate entrance to San Francisco Bay by 2100, a 70 percent chance of a 2-foot rise and a 28 percent chance of a 3-foot rise. </P><P>But Alsup commented, “In other words, there’s a 50-50 chance of something between two and three feet. That’s still a lot of water, isn’t it?”</P><P>In addition to <mark>Chevron</mark>, the other companies sued are BP PLC, ConocoPhillips Co., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC. The other companies did not make presentations today, but Alsup instructed them to tell him within two weeks of any <mark>Chevron</mark> statements they disagree with. Otherwise, they will be deemed to agree, he said. </P><P>While <mark>Chevron</mark> chose a lawyer for its tutorial, San Francisco and Oakland selected three scientists.</P><P>Gary Griggs, an earth sciences professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz, noted that the 2017 California report said the rate of ice melting in Antarctica and Greenland has increased and that “waiting for absolute certainty is not an option.”</P><P>Griggs said the effects of sea level rises are worsened by other phenomena such as king tides and El Nino events.</P><P>He showed pictures of the San Francisco Embarcadero flooded during a king tide and a hypothetical map showing that more than half of Oakland International Airport would be submerged if the sea level rises by 3 feet.</P><P>University of Illinois atmospheric science professor Don Wuebbles, who contributed to the 2013 IPCC report, said, “The science did not stop at 2012. There is a lot we have learned in the past five years.”</P><P>Wuebbles said predictions are now more certain and the rate of increase in sea level is higher than at any time in the last 2,800 years.</P><P>“Our projections are a rise of one to 4 feet by the end of the century, but it could be as high as 8 feet,” he said.</P><P>Alsup has set a briefing schedule for the companies’ motion to dismiss that could extend to the end of April, meaning that a hearing would not be held until May.</P><P>San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement, “What we saw today was one oil company begrudgingly accepting the scientific consensus while trying to overemphasize the extent of scientific uncertainty.</P><P>“These companies have made enormous profits while putting our cities in harm’s way.

The plaintiffs alleged that Peabody (and a number of other fossil fuel companies) caused greenhouse gas emissions that resulted in sea level rise and damage to their property. Peabody,  a coal company, filed for bankruptcy in April 2016 and emerged from bankruptcy under a plan that became effective on April 3, 2017. As an initial matter, the bankruptcy court said the plaintiffs had not established any basis for a claim because the complaints’ only Peabody-specific allegations were that Peabody had exported coal from terminals or ports in several California counties and was a member of organizations that plaintiffs said denied <mark>climate change</mark>. The court further concluded, however, that even assuming claims did exist, the claims were pre-bankruptcy petition claims that had been discharged under the bankruptcy plan because the plaintiffs had not filed proofs of claim. The court determined, moreover, that even if the plaintiffs’ claims could be construed as post-effective date claims (i.e., claims concerning conduct and harm after Peabody emerged from bankruptcy), the claims did not fall within the scope of a settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other governmental entities to allow continued enforcement of environmental laws related to ongoing mining operations. The bankruptcy court also rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that one of their nuisance claims did not constitute a “Claim” or “Liability” pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code and Peabody’s bankruptcy plan and therefore could not be discharged and enjoined.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>09/26/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20170926_docket-16-42529-399_opposition.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Objection filed to Peabody motion.</TD><TD><STRONG>California Counties and City Argued for Keeping Peabody in <mark>Climate</mark> Case.</STRONG> San Mateo and Marin Counties and the City of Imperial Beach (the plaintiffs) opposed Peabody Energy Corporation’s (Peabody) motion in federal bankruptcy court in Missouri to enjoin them from pursuing their public nuisance and tort law claims against Peabody.

Peabody argued that the discharge and injunction contained in its plan for reorganization barred the claims. The plaintiffs argued that multiple carve-outs in the injunction allowed them to proceed with their claims against Peabody.

But in a broken political system dominated by tit for tat Twitter attacks, it might be the only place left in America where actual adults can address these issues calmly and maturely. The cities of San Francisco and Oakland have sued 5 major oil companies — <mark>Chevron</mark>, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Shell, and BP — claiming they knew decades ago that their operations were causing average global temperatures to increase, and that they kept their knowledge private, putting millions of people at risk. In particular, those who live in the San Francisco Bay Area are likely to suffer damages as a result of rising ocean levels that threaten to put large swaths of land adjacent to the Bay underwater.</P><H3 style=""text-align: center;"">8 Questions</H3><DIV id=""attachment_142874"" style=""width: 580px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Judge William Alsup Credit: Sacramento Bee</P></DIV><P>One of the adults in the room is judge William Alsup. If  his name sounds familiar, he presided over the recent litigation between Waymo and Uber. After he <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2018/03/05/judge-allows-<mark>climate</mark>-change-suit-fossil-fuel-companies-proceed-federal-court/"">denied a motion</A> earlier this month by the cities to send the case back to state court, he decided to educate himself about the issues by posing a series of 8 questions for the litigants to answer.</P><OL class=""block""><LI>What caused the various ice ages (including the “little ice age” and prolonged cool periods) and what caused the ice to melt? When they melted, by how much did sea level rise?</LI><LI>What is the molecular difference by which <mark>CO2</mark> absorbs infrared radiation but oxygen and nitrogen do not?</LI><LI>What is the mechanism by which infrared radiation trapped by <mark>CO2</mark> in the atmosphere is turned into heat and finds its way back to sea level?</LI><LI>Does <mark>CO2</mark> in the atmosphere reflect any sunlight back into space such that the reflected sunlight never penetrates the atmosphere in the first place?</LI><LI>Apart from <mark>CO2</mark>, what happens to the collective heat from tail pipe exhausts, engine radiators, and all other heat from combustion of fossil fuels? How, if at all, does this collective heat contribute to warming of the atmosphere?</LI><LI>In grade school, many of us were taught that humans exhale <mark>CO2</mark> but plants absorb <mark>CO2</mark> and return oxygen to the air (keeping the <mark>carbon</mark> for fiber). Is this still valid? If so, why hasn’t plant life turned the higher levels of <mark>CO2</mark> back into oxygen? Given the increase in human population on Earth (four billion), is human respiration a contributing factor to the buildup of <mark>CO2</mark>?</LI><LI>What are the main sources of <mark>CO2</mark> that account for the incremental buildup of <mark>CO2</mark> in the atmosphere?</LI><LI>What are the main sources of heat that account for the incremental rise in temperature on Earth?</LI></OL><P>The judge’s questions have sparked a lively debate online. Andrew Dessler, a <mark>climate</mark> scientist from Texas A&amp;M University created a conversation about those questions on <A href=""https://twitter.com/AndrewDessler/status/971818482915532800"">Twitter</A>. He applauded Judge Alsup for his unique approach to the proceedings in his courtroom. “Obviously, I wish these issues were not still being debated in court, since they’re not being debated in the scientific community, but I also appreciate the deliberate approach the judge seems to be taking,” he said in a written comment to <EM><A href=""https://grist.org/article/a-federal-judge-has-<mark>climate</mark>-science-questions-here-are-the-answers/"">Grist</A>.</EM></P><H3 style=""text-align: center;""><mark>Chevron</mark> Will Not Contest That <mark>Climate Change</mark> Is Real</H3><P>Lawyers for <mark>Chevron</mark> say they will not contest that <mark>climate change</mark> is real. Instead, they say they will accept the findings set forth in the <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/"">Fifth Assessment report</A> of the <A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/"">Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark></A>. “<mark>Chevron</mark>’s neither going to overstate nor understate degrees of confidence. <mark>Chevron</mark>’s simply going to present the conclusions of the IPCC because <mark>Chevron</mark> thinks that’s the best and the most accurate way of responding to the court’s tutorial request,” Avi Garbow, co-chair of the environmental litigation group at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, the law firm representing <mark>Chevron</mark>. Garbow once worked in the Obama administration and defended the Clean Power Plan in court when he was general counsel to Gina McCarthy, who headed the EPA at the time, according to <EM><A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/<mark>chevron</mark>-will-stick-to-ipcc-findings-in-landmark-<mark>climate</mark>-change-trial/"">Scientific American</A>.</EM></P><P>Even though the defendants have not sought to make the reality of <mark>climate change</mark> an issue in the case, they are still seeking to dismiss the case on the grounds that only the EPA has the legal authority to regulate <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions under current US law. That’s an interesting strategy, since the fossil fuel companies, via their highly paid shills at the American Petroleum Institute and other industry trade groups, screamed bloody murder when the EPA first proposed to regulate <mark>carbon</mark> emissions as a pollutant. Which only proves once again that hypocrisy is the best friend of those looking to make a buck while jeopardizing the health of the planet and all the species who live on it.</P><P>“This is not the first (or even the second or third) time a plaintiff has tried to plead global warming-related tort claims,” <mark>Chevron</mark> said in its motion to dismiss. “Similar claims have been considered, and dismissed, by the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit, and district courts around the country.”</P><P><mark>Climate</mark> scientists are distressed that the Fifth Assessment report will become the measuring stick for this litigation.  The <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2018/02/26/keeping-global-temperature-increase-1-5-degrees-celsius-unlikely-says-ipcc-draft-report/"">Sixth Assessment</A> report is now being prepared and will be issued in 2019. Early drafts paint a much darker picture than the current report. Because of the rigorous process that goes into preparing each report (a process that is waved away by <mark>climate</mark> deniers as mere “junk science”), each report is necessarily several years behind the most up-to-date <mark>climate</mark> science.</P><P>Will this lawsuit be the final nail in the coffin of the oil companies? Probably not. Even if Judge Alsup finds in favor of the plaintiffs, his decision will have to withstand scrutiny from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and a hostile majority of committed <mark>climate</mark> deniers on the US Supreme Court. But the suit could have important implications nonetheless.</P><P>Daniel Farber, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, says “Most or all of the major oil corporations have now acknowledged the reality of <mark>climate change</mark> and the need for government action (though who knows how serious they are about that). So it would be hard for them to take a contrary view in this litigation. Getting them to say the same thing in court will be kind of a victory for the plaintiffs even if nothing else goes their way,” according to the <EM>Scientific American</EM> story. Maybe baby steps are the best we can hope for at this juncture.</P><P><CENTER><EM><STRONG><SPAN style=""font-size: large;"">Support CleanTechnica’s work via donations on <A href=""https://www.patreon.com/CleanTechnica/overview"" rel=""nofollow""><STRONG><SPAN style=""color: #339966;"">Patreon</SPAN></STRONG></A> or <A href=""https://www.paypal.me/ImportantMedia"" rel=""nofollow""><STRONG><SPAN style=""color: #339966;"">PayPal</SPAN></STRONG></A>!</SPAN></STRONG></EM></CENTER></P></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It’s certainly possible that Cohen would have made the payment on Trump’s behalf in any circumstance. But the judicial system would have to weigh that defense against Giuliani’s remarks Thursday on <I>Fox and Friends</I>, which <A href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/03/trump-stormy-daniels-allegations-rudy-giuliani-566045"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">clearly suggested</A> that Clifford, who alleges she had sex with Trump in 2006, was <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyer-arranged-130-000-payment-for-adult-film-stars-silence-1515787678?mod=searchresults&amp;page=2&amp;pos=10&amp;mod=article_inline"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">paid a month before the election</A> so as not to hurt Trump’s campaign.

He did his job.”)</SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><SPAN>Second: My references to timing were not describing my understanding of the President’s knowledge, but instead, my understanding of these matters. </SPAN></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Here, Giuliani is claiming that he didn’t have all the facts when he discussed Trump’s sensitive legal affairs on national television. Despite this assertion, he seemed to understand the situation pretty well during his media tour. He <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/transcript-giuliani-interview-with-the-washington-post/2018/05/03/a35c4a3c-4e9b-11e8-af46-b1d6dc0d9bfe_story.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">told the <I>Washington Post</I>’s Robert Costa</A> how the payments were structured, when Trump knew and didn’t know about them, and that he’d even discussed the matter with Trump in recent days.

Voting in new members requires a quorum of twelve, which effectively means that the committee is unable to conduct any official business.

      its resilience under a low <mark>carbon</mark> scenario.

      Change Resilience – A Framework for Decision Making</I></A>, the 
      publication builds on the company’s prior report on managing <mark>climate</mark> 
      change risks and provides more detail on the company’s approach to 
      governance, risk management, strategic planning and emission reduction 
      investments and activities, including key metrics.
    </P><P>
      “We proactively consider <mark>climate change</mark> in our business decisions, and 
      we have the experience, processes and governance in place to manage the 
      risks,” said Michael Wirth, <mark>Chevron</mark>’s Chairman and CEO. “We believe we 
      are equipped to continue to succeed in any business environment as we 
      deliver affordable, reliable energy that is a fundamental driver of 
      economic growth and human progress.”
    </P><P>
      Aligned with the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on 
      <mark>Climate</mark>-Related Financial Disclosures recommendations, <mark>Chevron</mark>’s report 
      explains the company’s strategic decision-making approach to <mark>climate</mark> 
      change related risks. These include ongoing evaluations of the company’s 
      portfolio and future investments, its views of supply, demand, commodity 
      and <mark>carbon</mark> prices, and the factors that drive global economic change.
    </P><P>
      The report summarizes <mark>Chevron</mark>’s work to test the competitiveness of its 
      current assets under multiple scenarios, including some of the most 
      restrictive greenhouse gas reduction proposals such as the <mark>Sustainable</mark> 
      Development Scenario from the International Energy Agency. The results 
      demonstrate that the company’s portfolio, due to its maturity and 
      diversity across assets and geographies, is resilient in a wide variety 
      of possible scenarios and enables <mark>Chevron</mark> to be flexible in response to 
      potential changes.
    </P><P>
      “We know that <mark>climate change</mark> is a growing area of interest for our 
      investors and other stakeholders. We’re committed to addressing the 
      risks of <mark>climate change</mark> while delivering the energy that benefits 
      societies and economies,” said Dr. Ronald Sugar, lead independent 
      director for <mark>Chevron</mark>’s Board of Directors.
    </P><P>
      <mark>Chevron</mark> is a leader in improving how reliable and affordable energy is 
      developed and delivered to meet global demand. The company is making its 
      operations more energy efficient, reducing flaring, managing methane 
      emissions and investing in low-<mark>carbon</mark> technologies. In addition, <mark>Chevron</mark> 
      is investing in the <mark>innovation</mark>s and innovators of tomorrow through 
      research and development and investments in science, technology, 
      engineering and math focused education.

      activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production 
      from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; 
      potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned 
      projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company’s 
      operations due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe 
      weather, cyber threats and terrorist acts, crude oil production quotas 
      or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum

      environmental regulations and litigation; significant operational, 
      investment or product changes required by existing or future 
      environmental statutes and regulations, including international 
      agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures 
      to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the potential liability 
      resulting from other pending or future litigation; the company’s future 
      acquisition or disposition of assets or shares or the delay or failure 
      of such transactions to close based on required closing conditions; the 
      potential for gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; 
      government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, 
      industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on 
      scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with 
      the U.S. dollar; material reductions in corporate liquidity and access 
      to debt markets; the impact of the 2017 U.S. tax legislation on the 
      company's future results; the effects of changed accounting rules under 
      generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting 
      bodies; the company's ability to identify and mitigate the risks and 
      hazards inherent in operating in the global energy industry; and the 
      factors set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” on pages 19 through

In a California courtroom on Wednesday, <mark>Chevron</mark>’s attorneys didn’t dispute the science that suggested humans, and by extension oil companies, were at least contributing to adverse <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P><mark>Chevron</mark> stock holders need not hit the panic button just yet. <mark>Chevron</mark> didn’t exactly admit guilt as it pertains to its role in <mark>climate change</mark>. And, the legal argument being levied against “Big Oil” in this particular case is a bit confusing in its goal. Every little bit helps, or hurts, though, depending on which side of the table you’re sitting on.</P><H3>It’s Complicated</H3><P>The pre-trial hearing, which took place in San Francisco, didn’t determine innocence or guilt. The hearing was simply an unconventional way for litigants to decide which weapons would be allowed to be wielded in an upcoming legal battle between the five most prominent oil names and the coastal cities of San Francisco and Oakland.</P><P>They’re suing the five Big Oil icons not to stop spewing <mark>CO2</mark> into the earth’s atmosphere, but rather, to demand these energy companies <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-<mark>climate</mark>change-hearing/<mark>chevron</mark>-says-it-will-not-dispute-<mark>climate</mark>-science-in-u-s-lawsuit-idUSKBN1GX185"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">help fund the construction of a wall</A> that will keep rising ocean waters from creeping into their cities.</P><P><mark>Chevron</mark>’s lawyers, along with attorneys representing the other top four oil names, are asking for a dismissal of the pending case. In the meantime though, none of them are denying that the plaintiff’s evidence of global warming is untrue.</P><P>The defendants are, however, still going to argue they can’t be held liable for the outcome of higher global temperatures. They all agree that only Congress (via the EPA) has jurisdiction over the fossil fuel emissions.	</P><P>The defendants added for good measure that they only provided what was being used by consumers, and that unchecked population growth exacerbated the issue.</P><H3>The Case for <mark>Chevron</mark> Stock</H3><P>It’s not a bad legal argument, truth be told. As <mark>Chevron</mark>’s written request for a dismissal <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/<mark>chevron</mark>-will-stick-to-ipcc-findings-in-landmark-<mark>climate</mark>-change-trial/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">noted</A>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“This is not the first (or even the second or third) time a plaintiff has tried to plead global warming-related tort claims. Similar claims have been considered, and dismissed, by the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit, and district courts around the country.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Also weakening the plaintiff’s case is the nature of the suit itself.</P><P>It’s being filed as a nuisance suit, which generally call for the closure of a business or the removal of an annoying eyesore or noise. Not this nuisance suit though. This one is gunning for money. Richard Faulk, public-nuisance experts and counsel with Davis Wright Tremaine, commented on the matter “what we have here is a typical tort lawsuit for damages.”</P><P>The plaintiff’s attorneys aren’t exactly shooting blanks though. Along with Big Oil’s concession that <mark>climate change</mark> is real, even if their role in it has not yet been determined, the suit also claims that the likes of Exxon Mobil, BP and <mark>Chevron</mark> all funded <mark>climate change</mark> research that was ultimately intended to mislead the public about fossil fuel’s role in damage to the environment.</P><P>As San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said it, “These companies knew their products were causing sea-level rise, and they deceived people about it. Now, that bill has come due.”</P><H3>Bottom Line for <mark>Chevron</mark> Stock</H3><P>From a pure letter of the law perspective, owners of <mark>Chevron</mark> stock don’t have a great deal to worry about. At worst it would share a modest amount of liability with the rest of the oil industry, as sole causation has yet to be pegged to oil companies. And, even if it is determined, this really is an EPA matter.</P><P>The deception claims (suggesting that Big Oil paid to deceive… everyone) haven’t worked in other similar cases.</P><P>On the flipside, U.S. courtrooms are increasingly moving away from ruling based on the strictest letter of the law, and <A href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2010/08/in_defense_of_the_new_judicial_activists.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">instead making decisions grounded in a sense of fairness</A>. On the wrong day at the wrong time with a judge and jury in the wrong mood, this could end up being a blow to Big Oil.</P><P>The real risk to <mark>Chevron</mark> stock, however, goes beyond this one case. By forcing oil companies to take the small step of acknowledging that <mark>climate change</mark> science is valid now, the next step to energy companies conceding fossil fuels are a leading cause of <mark>climate change</mark> is a small one.</P><P>The <mark>climate</mark> activists’ war won’t be won with a decisive victory, but dozens and dozens of successful, progressive skirmishes.</P><P><EM>As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

decision holding that <mark>Chevron</mark> Corp. must respond to shareholders’ <mark>climate</mark> risk related shareholder proposals and cannot exclude them from the ballot at the company’s annual meeting.  The first proposal asks <mark>Chevron</mark> to report how it plans to transition its business model to remain successful in a rapidly de<mark>carbon</mark>izing energy economy. The low <mark>carbon</mark> business model resolution was filed by shareholder representatives <EM>As You Sow </EM>andArjuna Capital along with co-filers American Baptist Home Mission Society and Zevin Asset Management<EM>. </EM></P><P>The SEC further upheld a shareholder proposal asking the company to report on its actions to reduce fugitive methane emissions. Methane is 86 times more <mark>climate</mark> intensive than <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide over a 20-year period, so reducing emissions from oil and gas operations is crucial to maintaining global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. <EM>As You Sow </EM>filed the methane proposal along with co-filers Dominican Sisters of Hope, Congregation of St. Joseph, Adrian Dominican Sisters, and Dignity Health.</P><P><mark>Chevron</mark> argued to the SEC that global warming lawsuits -- filed against the company by cities, states, children, and other groups harmed by global warming -- should preclude any <mark>climate change</mark> inquiry from shareholders, claiming that such inquiry would strategically harm their legal case.</P><P>“Had <mark>Chevron</mark> prevailed in its argument, shareholder inquiries about one of the most important issues of the century would be excluded from consideration,” said Danielle Fugere, President of <EM>As You Sow.</EM> “The SEC rightfully declined to allow <mark>Chevron</mark> to muzzle shareholders.”</P><P>Natasha Lamb, managing partner, Arjuna Capital, said, “The clock is ticking on how Big Oil will respond to <mark>climate change</mark> and <mark>Chevron</mark> can’t choose to hide behind a stack of litigation.  Investors have the right to know how the company will adapt its business to <mark>climate</mark> risks.” </P><P>The low <mark>carbon</mark> business model resolution and methane resolution are expected to go to a vote at <mark>Chevron</mark>’s annual meeting in late May.</P><P style=""text-align:center"">###</P><P><EM><A href=""https://www.asyousow.org/""><EM>As You Sow</EM></A></EM><EM> is a nonprofit organization that promotes environmental and social corporate responsibility through shareholder advocacy, coalition building, and innovative legal strategies.

Parker announced today that they had filed separate lawsuits on behalf of their respective cities against the five largest investor-owned producers of fossil fuels in the world. The lawsuits ask the courts to hold these companies responsible for the costs of sea walls and other infrastructure necessary to protect San Francisco and Oakland from ongoing and future consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> and sea level rise caused by the companies’ production of massive amounts of fossil fuels.</P><P>The defendant companies — <mark>Chevron</mark>, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil, BP and Royal Dutch Shell — have known for decades that fossil fuel-driven global warming and accelerated sea level rise posed a catastrophic risk to human beings and to public and private property, especially in coastal cities like San Francisco and Oakland, who have the largest shoreline investments on San Francisco Bay.</P><P>Despite that knowledge, the defendant companies continued to aggressively produce, market and sell vast quantities of fossil fuels for a global market, while at the same time engaging in an organized campaign to deceive consumers about the dangers of massive fossil fuel production.</P><P>The lawsuits filed Tuesday in the superior courts in San Francisco and Alameda Counties were developed with assistance from the law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP.</P><P>Like the tobacco companies who were sued in the 1980s, these defendants knowingly and recklessly created an ongoing public nuisance that is causing harm now, and in the future risks catastrophic harm to human life and property, including billions of dollars of public and private property in Oakland and San Francisco.</P><P>“These fossil fuel companies profited handsomely for decades while knowing they were putting the fate of our cities at risk,” San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said. “Instead of owning up to it, they copied a page from the Big Tobacco playbook. They launched a multi-million dollar disinformation campaign to deny and discredit what was clear even to their own scientists: global warming is real, and their product is a huge part of the problem. Now, the bill has come due. It’s time for these companies to take responsibility for the harms they have caused and are continuing to cause.”</P><P>“Global warming is an existential threat to humankind, to our ecosystems and to the wondrous, myriad species that inhabit our planet,” Oakland City Attorney Barbara J. Parker said. “These companies knew fossil fuel-driven <mark>climate change</mark> was real, they knew it was caused by their products and they lied to cover up that knowledge to protect their astronomical profits. The harm to our cities has commenced and will only get worse. The law is clear that the defendants are responsible for the consequences of their reckless and disastrous actions.”</P><P>The fossil fuel industry’s own records show that the defendant companies have knowingly misled the American public and the world about the dangers of fossil-fuel driven <mark>climate change</mark>. For example, in 1968, a scientific consultant working for the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association representing fossil fuel companies, warned that <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions were “almost certain” to produce significant temperature increases and a rise in sea levels. In 1980, API and its member companies learned that “likely impacts” of global warming would include “globally catastrophic effects.”</P><P>Despite their knowledge of the scientific consensus on these issues, and despite warnings from their own internal scientists and/or scientists retained by their trade association, defendants continue to engage in massive fossil fuel production. They also continue to promote fossil fuels, and have developed multi-decade future business plans based upon increased fossil fuel usage even as global warming has progressed into a severe danger zone.</P><P>Defendants’ contributions to global warming have already caused sea levels to rise in San Francisco Bay and threatened imminent harm to San Francisco and Oakland from storm surges. Sea levels will continue rising in the Bay due to defendants’ past, present and ongoing conduct, and this ongoing conduct exacerbates a problem that is largely irreversible. A recent state report, <A href=""http://www.opc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/docs/rising-seas-in-california-an-update-on-sea-level-rise-science.pdf"">Rising Seas in California</A>, projects as much as 10 feet of additional sea level rise along San Francisco’s coastline by 2100, which would be catastrophic. </P><P>In Oakland and San Francisco, property worth billions of dollars is located six feet or less above current sea levels.  In San Francisco, bayside sea level rise from global warming places at risk at least $10 billion of public property and as much as $39 billion of private property.</P><P>San Francisco has already taken a number of steps to start addressing the problem. Those include creating a Sea Level Rise Action Plan, a precursor to implementing a long-term infrastructure plan necessary to protect our city against rising water levels. San Francisco has also integrated sea level rise guidance into our long-term city capital plan.</P><P>“San Francisco has been a leader on many levels when it comes to addressing sea level rise,” Herrera said. “Now we’re going to ensure that those responsible for the problem are held to account.”</P><P>Sea level rise, storm surges and flooding threaten not only physical infrastructure but the safety, lives, daily way of life, sense of community, and security of Oakland and San Francisco residents.</P><P>San Francisco is also extremely vulnerable to accelerated sea level rise and storm surges because it is surrounded by water on three sides. Sea level rise will disproportionately impact some of San Francisco’s most vulnerable residents, including those in the Bayview/Hunters Point neighborhood. It also threatens some of San Francisco’s most iconic and valuable buildings.  For example, the Ferry Building would be temporarily flooded during a 100-year extreme tide today, but could be flooded every day after 36 inches of sea level rise.</P><P>A significant portion of the combined sewer and storm water infrastructure on the west side of San Francisco is at severe risk of shoreline erosion caused by sea level rise.  As a result, San Francisco has developed plans to protect that infrastructure at an initial estimated cost of $350 million. Shoreline erosion along Ocean Beach also threatens roads, pathways, private properties, and buildings along the shore.</P><P>In Oakland, these disastrous consequences will disproportionately impact and endanger the lives and property of African American, Hispanic and other people of color as well as low income populations who reside in West Oakland and the flatlands of East Oakland.</P><P>The 2014 National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment, produced by over 300 experts and the National Academy of Sciences, specifically identified Oakland’s airport as threatened by sea level rise. The Oakland airport is more than a foot lower than New York-LaGuardia, which was flooded during Hurricane Sandy. Sea level rise and related flooding also imminently threaten Oakland’s sewer system.  Rising sea levels imminently threaten to prevent water from discharging properly from the sewer system, which will cause sewage to back up and flood certain sections of the city.</P><P>San Francisco and Oakland already have begun to suffer the consequences of <mark>climate change</mark>, although the most severe injuries by far are the injuries that will occur in the future — unless prompt action is taken to protect these cities and their residents from rising sea levels and other harms caused by global warming. <mark>Climate change</mark> models show large parts of San Francisco and Oakland, including the Oakland airport, under water within 100 years during storm surges.</P><P>The lawsuits ask the courts to hold the defendants jointly and severally liable for creating, contributing to and/or maintaining a public nuisance, and to create an abatement fund for each city to be paid for by defendants to fund infrastructure projects necessary for San Francisco and Oakland to adapt to global warming and sea level rise. The total amount needed for the abatement funds is not known at this time but is expected to be in the billions of dollars.</P><P>The cases are: <EM>People of the State of California v.

Literally.</P><P>Employing the legal strategy that brought states major payouts from tobacco companies decades ago, the plaintiffs are demanding that oil interests begin writing checks to protect Californians against rising seas, crippling drought and harmful air.</P><P>The legal viability of the lawsuits is unclear; the cases are in early stages. But if any succeed, the implications are profound: The state is already spending hundreds of millions of dollars to shore up coastlines, protect infrastructure and retrofit roads and bridges in response to rising seas. And if companies are persuaded to drill and refine less oil, California has a much better chance of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions on the schedule it has set.</P><P>Besides Richmond, plaintiffs include the cities of Imperial Beach, Oakland, Santa Cruz and San Francisco and the counties of Marin, San Mateo and Santa Cruz. The Los Angeles City Council is considering its own suit.</P><P>The state has not joined in, something environmental groups say is a failure of leadership.</P><P>“Accountability is critical,” said Kassie Siegel, director of the <mark>Climate</mark> Law Institute at the Center for Biological Diversity. “The state of California can and should file a case seeking money damages and also an injunction against ongoing activities.”</P><P>The California Department of Justice has sued the Trump administration two dozen times over policies that include several related to the environment. Asked whether the state would join the cities and counties or consider filing its own suit against the oil companies, the Justice Department declined to comment about potential future action.</P><P>The city-county suits began six months ago when Imperial Beach, in southern San Diego County, sued a handful of oil companies. Richmond, surrounded on three sides by water and imperiled by rising seas, joined the fight Jan. 22. Its city council voted unanimously to sue 29 oil producers, even if it meant taking on <mark>Chevron</mark>, whose tax payments—$45 million in 2016—account for 25 percent of the city’s general fund.</P><P>“They are a pretty important corporate citizen,” said Richmond Mayor Tom Butt.</P><P>However, “we are a waterfront city—Richmond has 32 miles of shoreline on the Bay. Part of our city is vulnerable to sea-level rise: our transportation systems, neighborhoods and commercial areas and thousands of acres of waterfront park.”</P><P>Among those vulnerable venues is <mark>Chevron</mark>’s refinery, which sits at the edge of San Francisco Bay. Completed in 1902, this refinery, the state’s largest, was immediately dubbed “the colossus.” The facility today employs more than 3,400 people.</P><P>Leah Casey, the spokeswoman for <mark>Chevron</mark>’s Richmond refinery, said in a statement that lawsuits like the local ones “will do nothing to address the serious issue of <mark>climate change</mark>. Reducing greenhouse-gas emissions is a global issue that requires global engagement.”</P><P>Butt said the city sued “out of frustration, because I know that these fossil fuel companies are aware of the long-term costs and damage of the widespread consumption of fossil fuel.” He said Richmond was already planning for the sea’s rise but had not yet calculated mitigation costs.</P><P>The suits are filed in state court under California’s public-nuisance law, which allows legal actions against activities that are “injurious to health.”</P><P>New York City filed a similar claim against five of the world’s largest oil companies in federal court, asking that the cost of mitigating damage done by the companies as a result of their contribution to <mark>climate change</mark> be charged to them.</P><P>The legal challenges also assert that the oil industry has known for decades that burning fossil fuels accelerates <mark>climate change</mark>. The Richmond complaint states, “The industry has known for decades that business-as-usual combustion of their products could be ‘severe’ or even ‘catastrophic.’</P><P>“Companies were so certain of the threat that some even took steps to protect their own assets from rising seas and more extreme storms,” the complaint goes on, “and they developed new technologies to profit from drilling in a soon-to-be-ice-free Arctic. Yet instead of taking steps to reduce the threat to others, the industry actually increased production while spending billions on public relations, lobbying, and campaign contributions to hide the truth.”</P><P>The slow unraveling of the decades-long industry cover-up of the medical harm from cigarettes turned the tide in the tobacco cases, according to Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the Emmett Institute on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the Environment at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law.</P><P>Carlson, who is advising some of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, said that courts will take into account the oil-industry-funded campaign to discredit <mark>climate</mark> science.</P><P>“That matters in California,” she said. “If you can show evidence that a defendant engaged in a campaign to obfuscate, it’s more than just a nice detail. Evidence helps.”</P><P>With much at stake, oil companies are pushing back hard. ExxonMobil has responded with a demand to depose lawyers representing the California cities and counties.</P><P>The company says it is a victim of a conspiracy and cities and counties are being disingenuous: When they issue municipal bonds, they portray risk from <mark>climate change</mark> as unpredictable, not the fault of oil firms, as the lawsuits claim.</P><P>The companies have also filed motions to move the cases to federal courts, where they believe there are precedents more favorable to them.</P><P>The number of the legal claims intended to monetize the consequences of a warming planet is growing. Carlson said greater scientific certainty about attributing <mark>climate change</mark> impacts to specific industries and companies has created a legal opening.</P><P>“The courts were uncomfortable that they couldn’t trace the harm,” she said.</P><P>California is the epicenter of so-called <mark>climate</mark>-attribution science, said Peter Frumhoff, director of science and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists.</P><P>“There’s really a quite robust ability to characterize the extent to which <mark>climate change</mark> impacts have worsened,” he said.</P><P>Further, by collating data taken from oil companies’ annual accounting and national and international energy agencies’ reports, “one can then connect the dots and assign a cost. That tees up the question, ‘Who is responsible and who should pay?’ ” Frumhoff said.</P><P>“This is where the science is taking us, with increasing specificity and confidence.”</P><P><EM>This story was done with support from the College Futures Foundation.

IEA has produced several scenarios, including (1) the New Policies Scenario, which takes into account commitments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that have been announced by countries but not yet implemented, such as under the Paris Agreement; (2) the Current Policies Scenario, which assumes no changes in current policies; and (3) the 450 Scenario, which sets out an energy pathway consistent with the goal of limiting temperature to 2 Degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</P><P>Shell’s report includes analysis on all three of these IEA scenarios and also references Shell’s scenario analysis that it published in 2013—the New Lens Scenarios—that considers several different economic and global issues such as trade protection and nuclear disarmament in addition to <mark>climate change</mark>. ExxonMobil’s report includes analysis not only on the IEA scenarios but also on the Energy Modeling Forum 27 from Stanford University, which assesses several different technology and energy models associated with various <mark>climate</mark> stabilization targets and considers both baseline and 2 Degrees Celsius scenarios. ExxonMobil took the average of the 2 Degrees Celsius scenarios it assessed to create its report. <mark>Chevron</mark>’s report focused solely on the IEA scenarios.</P><P>All three reports conclude that oil and gas will continue to be used as a major portion of the energy mix through 2040 and that all three companies are well-positioned to continue to be profitable over that time.</P><P><STRONG><mark>Climate</mark> Opportunities and Mitigation</STRONG></P><P>All three reports include information on the companies’ investments in alternative fuel sources, including biofuels, wind, and solar. In addition, all three reports include information on the companies’ research and development in <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage (CCS) technology, which includes the capturing and injection of GHGs into underground reservoirs. The reports also note the efforts that each of the companies is currently taking to reduce emissions from their own operations.</P><P><STRONG>Physical Risks </STRONG></P><P>The ExxonMobil report includes a section in the report on “Engineering Resiliency,” which focuses on ExxonMobil’s current and planned actions to address risks associated with “different physical environments” and “weather and natural elements.” Those actions and plans include the following:</P><UL><LI> Assess the location of current and future facilities to determine weather impacts. ExxonMobil provides the examples of offshore facilities being impacted by changes in wave and wind intensity as well as by ice flow patterns, while onshore facilities could be vulnerable to sea level rise, changes in storm surge, or geotechnical considerations.</LI><LI>Assess the design, construction, and operation of ExxonMobil’s facility to ensure they withstand a variety of extreme weather and environmental conditions. ExxonMobil’s report states that it uses historical experience with additional safety factors in these efforts.</LI><LI>Monitor and manage ongoing facility integrity, for example through periodic checks on key aspects of the structures. </LI><LI>Participate with major engineering societies and industry groups to assess and update engineering standards.</LI><LI>Maintain disaster preparedness, response, and business continuity plans. Detailed, well-practiced, and continuously improved emergency response plans tailored to each facility help ExxonMobil prepare for unplanned events, including extreme weather. Regular emergency drills are practiced in partnership with appropriate government agencies and community coalitions to help ensure readiness and minimize the impacts of such events. </LI></UL><P><mark>Chevron</mark>’s report more specifically addresses potential physical impacts from <mark>climate change</mark> and includes actions that <mark>Chevron</mark> has already taken to address some of those risks, including:</P><UL><LI>Undertaking a global assessment of possible impacts to assets, including those resulting from the possibility of increased frequency and/or severity of storms, rising sea levels, temperature increases or decreases, and interruptions in water supply availability;</LI><LI>Participating in a joint industry project with experts at the National Center for Atmospheric Research to better understand possible changes in the frequency and magnitude of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico over the next 50 years and are using information from this work to support the meteorology and oceanography (metocean) design basis for offshore Gulf of Mexico assets; and</LI><LI>Working with host governments to ensure that the design basis for particular long-lived asset investments reflects views of possible metocean scenarios.</LI></UL><P>Shell’s report does not include information on the specific steps it plans to take to address potential physical impacts from <mark>climate change</mark>, but Shell’s report does note briefly that potential physical risks from <mark>climate change</mark>, such as water costs and availability, could affect its operations and that flooding/drainage, storm damage, sea level rise, and capacity de-rating could affect Shell’s assets.</P><P><STRONG>Executive Compensation</STRONG></P><P>The ExxonMobil report mentions briefly that executive compensation for the company takes into account <mark>climate change</mark> issues: compensation is structured to ensure that “executives consider how decisions made today will affect shareholder value a decade later; these decisions comprehend the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> where appropriate.” Executive compensation is not mentioned in either the <mark>Chevron</mark> or the Shell reports, but Shell has issued public statements that it has and will connect executive compensation to reductions in GHG emissions from its operations.</P><P><STRONG><mark>Carbon</mark> Tax</STRONG></P><P>ExxonMobil’s report mentions that last year ExxonMobil joined the <mark>Climate</mark> Leadership Council, a pro-<mark>carbon</mark>-tax organization.

Even those who continue to reject the <mark>carbon</mark> bubble premise soon could find they have to engage with it more fully, given the international Financial Stability Board is consulting on proposals that would require firms to provide investors with much richer information on the <mark>climate</mark>-related risks they face. </P><P>The sense that a new trend is emerging was further reinforced last week when Shell released its annual reports containing details of how 10 percent of executive bonuses are linked to performance against the firm's <mark>climate</mark> targets, a move which <A href=""http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/3006179/shell-to-offload-canadian-oil-sands-for-usd725bn"">coincided</A> with the announcement it is selling $7.25 billion of investment in Canadian oil sands (although the latter move was billed as a debt reduction, rather than a <mark>climate</mark>-motivated decision).</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Even those who continue to reject the <mark>carbon</mark> bubble premise soon could find they have to engage with it more fully.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><P>The report was swiftly followed up by an address Thursday evening from Shell boss Ben van Beurden, who told an audience of oil experts at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston that the industry risks losing the support of the public if it does not support the clean energy transition.</P><P>&quot;I do think trust has been eroded to the point that it is becoming a serious issue for our long-term future,&quot; he warned. &quot;If we are not careful, broader public support for the sector will wane.&quot;</P><P>He urged the industry to accept that &quot;peak oil&quot; is imminent. &quot;We have to acknowledge that oil demand will peak, and it could already be in the next decade,&quot; he said. &quot;It could happen. There are people who believe it will grow forever but I don't subscribe to that.&quot;</P><P>Van Beurden also used the speech to announce an increase in Shell's renewable energy investments to $1 billion a year by the end of the decade and renew calls for a robust <mark>carbon</mark> price to regulate emissions.  </P><P>Meanwhile, a new report published by Norwegian energy giant Statoil set a target to cut its <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by 3 million tons a year by 2030, in addition to existing plans to shift 15 to 20 percent of its capital spending to renewables and low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy solutions over the next 10 years.</P><P class=""ads-after-this-paragraph"">Statoil aims to cut <mark>carbon</mark> emissions per barrel of oil produced from 10kgs today to 8kgs by 2030, declared the firm's president and chief executive, Eldar Sætre.</P><P class=""ads-after-this-paragraph"">&quot;Statoil is committed to developing its business in support of the ambitions of the Paris Agreement,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;We believe that being able to produce oil and gas with lower emissions while also growing in profitable renewables will give competitive advantages and provide attractive business opportunities in the transition to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy.&quot;</P><P>The flurry of activity has led some in the green economy to feel optimistic about the progress of the global energy system aligning with the Paris goals. &quot;The increase in talk about <mark>climate change</mark> within the oil sector since the Paris Agreement has been quite marked,&quot; said Richard Black, director of the Energy and <mark>Climate</mark> Intelligence Unit. &quot;Last year we saw two oil companies producing 2-degree scenarios for the first time, and now we have for the first time the boss of a major player acknowledging for the first time that they are slowly losing their social license.

The case in San Francisco is weighing the question of whether <mark>climate change</mark> damages connected to the burning of oil are specifically the fault of the companies that extract and sell it.</P><DIV class=""pull-right pull-right-wide""><P class=""media-caption"">A federal trial pitting two cities against major oil companies could reshape the landscape of legal claims for <mark>climate change</mark>-related damages.<SPAN class=""media-attrib""> (Image credit: Walter Siegmund / Wikimedia Commons)</SPAN></P></DIV><P>The judge in <EM>People of the State of California v. BP P.L.C. et al.</EM> had both the plaintiffs – the cities of Oakland and San Francisco – and the defendants – several major oil companies – answer basic questions about <mark>climate change</mark> in a tutorial format. Counter to what some might have expected, an oil company lawyer largely confirmed the consensus science on the issue, but challenged the idea that oil companies should be held accountable.</P><P><EM>Stanford Report</EM> spoke with <A href=""https://profiles.stanford.edu/katharine-mach"">Katharine Mach</A>, a senior research scientist at the <A href=""http://earth.stanford.edu/"">School of Earth, Energy &amp; Environmental Science</A>, and <A href=""https://profiles.stanford.edu/deborah-sivas"">Deborah Sivas</A>, the Luke W. Cole Professor of Environmental Law, to get their perspectives on the <mark>climate</mark> tutorial, the science in question and the role of the judiciary in confronting <mark>climate change</mark> challenges.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Why did the judge take such an unorthodox approach, in requesting a tutorial from the parties in this suit?</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Sivas:</STRONG> The way the questions were drafted – relatively straightforward questions of physical science that lead, inexorably, to the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) conclusions – and the way the judge engaged the parties during the proceeding make it pretty clear that the court largely understands <mark>climate</mark> science already.</P><P>The tutorial revealed that there is not going to be a lot of fighting about the fact that human activities are causing accelerated <mark>climate change</mark>. Although it wasn’t an evidentiary proceeding with decisions about the admissibility of factual information, it would be very difficult at this point for the defendants to backtrack and contest the anthropogenic causes of <mark>climate change</mark>. By holding this proceeding, the judge circumvented what could have been a couple of years of jostling and motion practice in discovery.</P><P>Secondly, the tutorial appears to have flushed out and previewed the oil industry’s legal theory in defending the case. From what I can tell, <mark>Chevron</mark>’s lawyer intimated that the oil companies’ defense will be that the science of anthropogenic causes was not clear until a few years ago and now that it is clear, the industry isn’t denying it; and that the industry shouldn’t be held liable because it is the use of fossil fuels by each and every one of us that is causing the problem, not the mere extraction of the material from the ground.</P><P>Finally, I suspect the court was using this novel case as an opportunity for a bit of public education. The judge likely knew that the media would cover the tutorial proceeding and that there would be some level of public interest in what the oil companies had to say. The fact that oil companies essentially conceded and reiterated the conclusions of the IPCC in open court makes the landscape even more challenging for the last few <mark>climate</mark> deniers still out there.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Why do you think both sides are largely in agreement on the science?</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Mach: </STRONG>Unsurprisingly, the experts who presented for the cities and also <mark>Chevron</mark>’s lawyer turned to comprehensive assessment of the existing body of research to draw their conclusions. For the past three decades now, the world’s scientists and governments have come together to take stock of the state of knowledge. It’s a grand partnership called the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>. Hundreds of authors from around the world pore over the literature, compare results across studies and draft text.

For example, risk assessment across all available evidence underscores that <mark>climate change</mark> unfolds across generations. Exactly how important is the present versus the future? Are people who have emitted the most heat-trapping gases historically – or who are emitting the most right now – more obliged to take action?

Discussions during the tutorial suggested that the different parties may well take different approaches to the complexities of <mark>climate change</mark>, for example, the deep uncertainties about how societies, policies and technologies will evolve many decades into the future and the implications for <mark>climate change</mark> solutions needed now. <mark>Climate change</mark> assessment has long emphasized that uncertainties are absolutely integral to the <mark>climate</mark> challenge and they will persist.

If the plaintiffs unearth damaging internal industry documents or force the industry to concede the foundational facts once and for all, that surely serves one public purpose. But whether state and local governments, which are experiencing rising sea levels and related <mark>climate</mark> impacts, will actually obtain compensation from the industry is a much more complex and uncertain question. Ultimately, the plaintiffs must show that a 50-year or whatever delay caused by the industry cover-up is the cause of damages that they are experiencing today.

The first piece is a leaked list of official talking points EPA officials are expected to promote on the subject of <mark>climate change</mark>. The second is a kind of surprising admission from a <mark>Chevron</mark> attorney in court that <mark>climate change</mark> is not only real, but that it’s caused by man and requires serious intervention.</P><P>Starting on the political side, it appears that EPA staffers have been unsure how they are expected to answer questions about <mark>climate change</mark> given that the current administration has such radically different views on the science compared to previous leadership.</P><P>To guide staffers, the EPA’s Office of Public Affairs sent out some talking points they can use, which leaked to the <A href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/epa-<mark>climate</mark>-adaptation_us_5abbb5e3e4b04a59a31387d7?ux"" target=""_blank"">Huffington Post</A>. Included on that list are statements such as:</P><UL><LI>“While there has been extensive research and a host of published reports on <mark>climate change</mark>, clear gaps remain, including our understanding of the role of human activity and what we can do about it.”</LI><LI>“The ability to measure with precision the degree and extent of [human] impact and what to do about it are subject to continuing debate and dialogue.”</LI></UL><P>These statements mirror EPA director Scott Pruitt’s overall strategy of portraying <mark>climate change</mark> as an ongoing debate where the science isn’t settled, even though the scientific community is abundantly clear where it stands on this critical environmental issue. Essentially, the EPA is being instructed to shrug at <mark>climate change</mark> rather than address it.</P><P>Meanwhile, in court last week, five of the world’s largest oil companies were dragged into federal court to explain their role in our <mark>climate change</mark> crisis. Oil companies have traditionally denied or downplayed global warming, but <A href=""https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/3/28/17152804/<mark>climate</mark>-change-federal-court-<mark>chevron</mark>"" target=""_blank""><mark>Chevron</mark>’s lawyer took a refreshingly different route</A>.</P><P>“<mark>Chevron</mark> accepts the consensus in the scientific communities on <mark>climate change</mark>,” Theodore Boutrous, a legal representative of <mark>Chevron</mark>, said. “There’s no debate about <mark>climate change</mark>.” He also acknowledged “it’s an issue for policymakers to address.”</P><P>Let’s be clear that Boutrous was careful not to seriously throw his client under the bus. He argued that <mark>Chevron</mark> had previously been resistant to <mark>climate</mark> alarmism because the science was not nearly as strong as it currently is. He also portrayed the oil giant as a “symptom” of booming industrialization and should not shoulder the blame for the environmental destruction because the entire world participates in this system.</P><P>Nevertheless, it’s clear that we live in a time where even a company like <mark>Chevron</mark> realizes that there’s no longer a benefit to questioning <mark>climate</mark> science. The fact that even the damned EPA can’t get on board with that messaging is distressing. Who are they protecting if not the oil companies?</P><P>In a fictional universe, this situation might seem comical, but the consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> are very much an ongoing threat for all inhabitants on this planet. At a point where we either need to take serious or concede defeat, we don’t have time to carefully equivocate with nonsense, anti-science talking points.</P><P>I never thought I’d say this, but why can’t the EPA be more like <mark>Chevron</mark>?</P><P><I>Photo credit: Thinkstock</I></P></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV id=""in_article""><DIV id=""wp_newsletter"" class=""blog-newsletter""><DIV class=""not_subscribed blog-not-subscribed"" style=""display:none""><H3>Love This?

decision holding that <mark>Chevron</mark> Corp. must respond to shareholders’ <mark>climate</mark> risk related shareholder proposals and cannot exclude them from the ballot at the company’s annual meeting.  The first proposal asks <mark>Chevron</mark> to report how it plans to transition its business model to remain successful in a rapidly de<mark>carbon</mark>izing energy economy.

Methane is 86 times more <mark>climate</mark> intensive than <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide over a 20-year period, so reducing emissions from oil and gas operations is crucial to maintaining global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. <EM>As You Sow </EM>filed the methane proposal along with co-filers Dominican Sisters of Hope, Congregation of St. Joseph, Adrian Dominican Sisters, and Dignity Health.</P><P><mark>Chevron</mark> argued to the SEC that global warming lawsuits -- filed against the company by cities, states, children, and other groups harmed by global warming -- should preclude any <mark>climate change</mark> inquiry from shareholders, claiming that such inquiry would strategically harm their legal case.</P><P>“Had <mark>Chevron</mark> prevailed in its argument, shareholder inquiries about one of the most important issues of the century would be excluded from consideration,” said Danielle Fugere, President of <EM>As You Sow.</EM> “The SEC rightfully declined to allow <mark>Chevron</mark> to muzzle shareholders.”</P><P>Natasha Lamb, managing partner, Arjuna Capital, said, “The clock is ticking on how Big Oil will respond to <mark>climate change</mark> and <mark>Chevron</mark> can’t choose to hide behind a stack of litigation.  Investors have the right to know how the company will adapt its business to <mark>climate</mark> risks.” </P><P>The low <mark>carbon</mark> business model resolution and methane resolution are expected to go to a vote at <mark>Chevron</mark>’s annual meeting in late May.</P><P style=""text-align:center"">###</P><P><EM><A href=""https://www.asyousow.org/""><EM>As You Sow</EM></A></EM><EM> is a nonprofit organization that promotes environmental and social corporate responsibility through shareholder advocacy, coalition building, and innovative legal strategies.

Last updated: April 5, 2018 9:41 pm EDT"">April 5, 2018
</TIME></SPAN><SPAN class=""pubdata separator"">—</SPAN>It was set up to be the showdown of the century.</P><P>San Francisco and Oakland, Calif., had filed lawsuits against five of the world’s largest fossil fuel companies seeking damages to cover the costs of mitigating the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>. And US District Judge William Alsup, the judge presiding over the consolidated cases, had requested a “tutorial” on <mark>climate</mark> science – from both sides. The Bay Area cities enlisted three top <mark>climate</mark> scientists. Just one person from among the five defendants (BP, the <mark>Chevron</mark> Corp., ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, and Royal Dutch Shell) chose to present: the lawyer from <mark>Chevron</mark>.</P><P>The lawyer<B> </B>took the stand on March 21. And it quickly became apparent that no dramatic courtroom showdown would happen that day.</P><P>“From <mark>Chevron</mark>’s perspective there’s no debate about <mark>climate</mark> science,” said Theodore Boutrous Jr., declaring that humans are indeed playing a significant role in causing <mark>climate change</mark>. That's a significant departure from the oil industry's long-held public skepticism, even though <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/05042018/shell-knew-scientists-<mark>climate</mark>-change-risks-fossil-fuels-global-warming-company-documents-netherlands-lawsuits"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">recently revealed documents show</A> that some companies not only knew about the risks but were considering their potential liability.</P><P>The case could still turn into a fierce battle over who should bear responsibility for <mark>climate change</mark>, but unlike many discussions of <mark>climate</mark> in political circles, it is at least beginning on the same page.</P><P>The judicial system is taking on a new role in the arc of America's <mark>climate</mark> narrative, as activists increasingly bring <mark>climate</mark> grievances to court. Some observers say civil, rule-bound, dispassionate courtrooms may turn out to be just the place to find clarity in the political turmoil around <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“We as an American public have looked at the courts as arbiters of truth,” says Sabrina McCormick, associate professor in the environmental and occupational health department at George Washington University in Washington. “We expect the courts to be places in which we have an opportunity to examine the facts and to hear both sides of the story and to make a judgement for ourselves.”</P><H2>Stretching the bounds of the court</H2><P>There has been a distinct increase in <mark>climate</mark>-related cases in recent years. In the 15 years before 2000, there were just six <mark>climate</mark>-related lawsuits filed in the United States. Since 2000, there have been <A href=""http://wordpress2.ei.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/us-<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">more than 1,000</A>. And this trend isn’t limited to the US. As of 2014, <mark>climate change</mark> cases had been filed in 12 countries, and by March 2017, <A href=""http://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/20767/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">that number had doubled</A>. Experts expect this upward trend to continue globally, especially as the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> increase.</P><P>Lawsuits have been an effective tactic in getting the federal government to address environmental issues for years. For example, in a landmark 2007 case the US Supreme Court sided with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in holding that the US Environmental Protection Agency is required to regulate CO<SUB>2</SUB>
 under the Clean Air Act.</P><P>“The courts I think are a traditional vehicle for litigants who aren’t getting relief through the [other] democratic branches of government,” says Steven Schwinn, a professor at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago. “My guess is the plaintiffs in these cases are not expecting a friendly reception in Congress or the White House, and so are turning to the courts.”</P><P>Government entities are the defendants in most <mark>climate change</mark> cases, but fossil fuel companies are increasingly being sued in “public nuisance” lawsuits like the California case. (New York City has also filed <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/01/10/new-york-city-sues-shell-exxonmobil-and-other-oil-majors-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change/?utm_term=.4aed8526925b"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">a similar high-profile suit</A>, as have other cities and counties around the country.)</P><P>While nuisance lawsuits are common cases for courts to handle, it is unusual for them to be applied to a threat as global and protracted as <mark>climate change</mark>. These cases are difficult to win, but they tend to bring public attention to the discussion in a way that serves <mark>climate</mark> activist goals, regardless of the verdict.</P><P>One long-shot case that has brought considerable media attention revolves around 21 young people who are suing federal agencies for failing to protect them. They’re claiming that federal policies ignored and exacerbated <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently <A href=""http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/377219-court-denies-trump-admins-plea-to-stop-kids-<mark>climate</mark>-lawsuit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">rejected a Trump administration motion</A> to dismiss the lawsuit, allowing discovery in the case (Juliana vs. United States) to continue.</P><P>By trying to legally force the federal government to take more action on <mark>climate change</mark>, the young plaintiffs may be asking the court to exceed its powers, experts say. But headlines highlighting “<mark>climate</mark> kids” suing the federal government have sparked interest among Americans who may not otherwise be interested in <mark>climate</mark>-related trials.</P><H2>A matter of tone</H2><P>Some experts caution that the inherently adversarial nature of courtroom discussions could deepen divisions around the already polarizing topic of <mark>climate change</mark>. “I’m afraid these lawsuits have become a vehicle for participating in polarized politics,” says Ernest Young, a professor at the Duke University School of Law in Durham, N.C.</P><P>But others see the courtroom as a more neutral forum where parties can set aside partisan rhetoric and communicate with each other in an orderly fashion.</P><P>Trial participants are “bound by procedural rules, by evidentiary rules, and there’s a neutral arbiter sitting in the front of the room, or on the side if it’s a trial by jury,” says Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Law at Columbia University in New York.</P><P>In such a formal setting, off-the-cuff theories, distractions, and distortions are less likely to gain traction. “Courts do hold the parties to higher standards of how they use science and evidence than [a legislature] certainly is held to,” agrees Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law. “If the science is relevant to the legal claims ... the judge will take it into account.”</P><P>As a result, all parties are more likely to agree about the basic science. That was already evident in the Bay Area-vs-oil companies courtroom tutorial, as <mark>Chevron</mark>'s attorney, Mr. Boutrous, heavily cited the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) report. </P><P>All Boutrous did, essentially, was agree to play basketball on the same size court as his opponents. The two sides will still likely try to beat each other as the case continues. But that admission alone was a break from a long-held industry position casting doubt on human effects on the <mark>climate</mark>. Establishing consensus for even some the ground rules for discussion could set the case up to be a more productive and clarifying debate.</P><P>And it’s not just the explicit rules of a courtroom that could encourage more reasoned conversations, Mr. Burger says. “There’s something also about norms,” he says. “When you’re in a courtroom, as a lawyer, you want to convey to the judge that you’re a reliable narrator, that you can be trusted, that you are an honest participant in the judicial system. And when wild theories come to play in the courtroom, you run the risk of ruining any credibility you have.”</P><P>The courtroom discovery process can be an avenue to introduce new information into the public record, as happened during a series of lawsuits against tobacco companies in the 1980s and ’90s. In the tobacco cases, these revelations played a key role in shifting public opinion, which was followed by the widespread prohibition of smoking in public spaces. </P><P>Edward Maibach, director of George Mason University’s Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Communication, suggests the airing of facts during <mark>climate</mark> trials could have similar effects.</P><H2>'People want somebody to take responsibility'</H2><P>Court cases could also bring a sense of urgency to the topic of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Although the majority (69 percent) of Americans don’t dispute that <mark>climate change</mark> is happening, according to <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>communication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016/?est=happening&amp;type=value&amp;geo=county"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">survey data</A> compiled by the Yale Program on <mark>Climate Change</mark> Communication in New Haven, they also largely see it as a distant problem (38 percent do not expect <mark>climate change</mark> will harm them personally). But recent nuisance cases highlight immediate effects that feel close to home for many Americans.</P><P>“They’re suing on the basis of costs incurred now, damages already accrued,” Professor Maibach says. “By its very nature, that is basically saying, ‘No, this isn’t a distant problem in space and time. This is a problem that’s creating problems and costing us money here in our town now.’ ”</P><P>GW's Dr. McCormick, who has researched trends within these <mark>climate change</mark> cases, says the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> already experienced, especially extreme weather events, may be a significant driver behind the increase in such cases. Natural disasters cost the US an estimated $306 billion in 2017, the <A href=""https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2018/0208/Natural-disasters-2017-costliest-year"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">most expensive year</A> on record.</P><P>“These impacts are incredibly costly, both economically and in terms of our lived experience in the world, in terms of our lives. People are dying. There’s nothing more serious. So we want someone to stop it,” she says. “People want somebody to take responsibility.”</P><P>During the courtroom tutorial last month in San Francisco, the lecture given by University of California, Santa Cruz, <mark>climate</mark> scientist Gary Griggs was underscored by a coincidence. Just as Professor Griggs was explaining recent studies on changing flood frequencies, an alarm sounded. Judge Alsup knew just what it was.</P><P>“Coastal flood alert,” he said. It was a monthly test of the system.</P><P>[<B>Editor’s note: </B><I>This story has been updated to clarify the full extent of allegations in the case </I>Juliana vs. United States.]</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV id=""story-bottom""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""content-bound small-centered small-11 medium-9 large-8 columns""><DIV id=""related-stories"" class=""eza-related_external_links""><H2>Next Up</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Specifically, we investigate two sets of probable oceanic impact events that occurred within the last 5,000 years, one in the Indian Ocean about 2800 BC, and the other in the Gulf of Carpentaria (Australia) about AD 536. If validated, they would be the most energetic natural catastrophes occurring during the middle-to-late Holocene with large-scale environmental and historical human effects and consequences. The physical evidence for these two impacts consists of several sets of data: (1) remarkable depositional traces of coastal flooding in dunes (<mark>chevron</mark> dunes) found in southern Madagascar and along the coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria, (2) the presence of crater candidates (29-km Burckle crater about 1,500 km southeast of Madagascar which dates to within the last 6,000 years and 18-km Kanmare and 12-km Tabban craters with an estimated age of AD 572±86 in the southeast corner of the Gulf of Carpentaria), and (3) the presence of quench textured magnetite spherules and nearly pure <mark>carbon</mark> spherules, teardrop-shaped tektites with trails of ablation, and vitreous material found by cutting-edge laboratory analytical techniques in the upper-most layer of core samples close to the crater candidates. Although some propose a wind-blown origin for V-shaped <mark>chevron</mark> dunes that are widely distributed around the coastlines of the Indian Ocean and in the Gulf of Carpentaria, we have evidence in favor of their mega tsunami formation. In southern Madagascar we have documented evidence for tsunami wave run-up reaching 205 m above sea-level and penetrating up to 45 km inland along the strike of the <mark>chevron</mark> axis. Subtly the orientation of the dunes is not aligned to the prevailing wind direction, but to the path of refracted mega-tsunami originating from Burckle impact crater. The results of our study show that substantive oceanic comet impacts not only have occurred more recently than modeled by astrophysicists, but also that they have profoundly affected Earth’s natural systems, <mark>climate</mark>, and human societies. If validated, they could potentially lead to a major paradigm shift in environmental science by recognizing the role of oceanic impacts in major <mark>climate</mark> downturns during the middle-to-late Holocene that have been well documented already by different techniques (tree-ring anomalies, ice-, lake- and peat bog-cores).</SPAN></DD><DT>Subject(s):</DT></DL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

But really, it’s just a change in tactics. They’ve denied the inevitable for decades, and now, under oath and under the cloud of <mark>climate</mark> reality, they’ve switched to denying responsibility.</P><P>That strategy makes sense in the context of a court case, which Big Oil will probably win.

</P><P>It will be up to historians to decide whether the five-hour-long <mark>climate</mark>-science seminar that took place yesterday in federal court made history. During the weeks leading up to the hearing, boosters had promised “the Scopes Monkey Trial for <mark>climate change</mark>,” a unique chance to litigate the science of human-driven global warming in a court of law. In the end, there were no Clarence Darrow-like rhetorical fireworks; just scientists and attorneys dispassionately reviewing the evidence about how human activities are transforming Earth’s atmosphere.		</P><DIV class=""message""><P>This article is co-published by <EM>The Nation</EM> and <EM><A target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra"">Sierra</A></EM>.</P></DIV></ARTICLE><P>Yet the hearing still marked an important milestone: For the first time, some of the world’s biggest <mark>carbon</mark> polluters were forced to explain to a US court whether they accept basic <mark>climate change</mark> science. Billions of dollars are at stake. The proceedings in San Francisco, according to legal experts, could shape the legal terrain for the lawsuits New York City and other plaintiffs are bringing against ExxonMobil and other fossil-fuel giants for the damage <mark>climate</mark>-fueled storms, sea-level rise, and other impacts have caused and will continue to cause in years to come.
</P><P>“You can’t get away with sitting there in silence,” Judge William Alsup pointedly said to attorneys from ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, BP, and other fossil-fuel corporations at the close of the day. “If you disagree [about the information the court had just heard], you need to let me know. Otherwise, I will deem that you agree.”
</P><P>The <mark>climate</mark>-science crash course before Judge Alsup was one of the first steps in an ambitious legal effort by some governments to hold oil, gas, and coal companies liable for the costs of <mark>climate</mark>-change related extreme weather events and adaptation planning. Eight California cities and counties have filed lawsuits against a range of <mark>carbon</mark> polluters. New York City has sued the five biggest non-state-owned oil companies—ExxonMobil, BP, <mark>Chevron</mark>, ConocoPhillips, and Royal Dutch Shell.
</P><P>“For decades, Big Oil ravaged the environment, and Big Oil copied Big Tobacco,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a January 10 press conference announcing New York’s lawsuit. “They used a classic cynical playbook. They denied and denied and denied that their product was lethal. Meanwhile, they spent a lot of time hooking society on that lethal product.… It’s time for them to start paying for the damage they’ve done.”</P><DIV class=""most-popular hover_b_remove""><H3>Most Popular</H3><ASIDE class=""left indent indents current-issue""><DIV class=""current-blocks""><A href=""https://www.thenation.com/issue/may-28-2018-issue/"" class=""textred-highlighted"">View our current issue</A></DIV></ASIDE><P>Big words, to be sure. But at the start of Wednesday’s hearing Judge Alsup went out of his way to tamp down expectations. “I read in the paper that this was going to be like the Scopes Monkey Trial, and I couldn’t help but laugh,” he said. A Mississippi-born Clinton appointee who clerked for the iconoclastic Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, Alsup is know for his idiosyncratic passion for self-education. For example, in a patent dispute case between Google and Oracle, Alsup took to writing computer code so that he could better understand the intricacies of the case.
</P><P>But the judge’s self-deprecation couldn’t disguise the anticipatory energy in the courtroom, which was packed with a who’s-who of <mark>climate</mark> attorneys. It was clear to everyone that this case was different than a pair of tech giants squaring off against each other. “I think this is an extremely significant moment in the judiciary,” Julia Olson, the lead counsel for the 21 young people who in a separate case are suing the federal government over <mark>climate change</mark>, said before the hearing. “[That’s] in part because it’s a sign that courts are really ready to deal with <mark>climate</mark> science, to deal with the injustices around <mark>climate change</mark>, and hold parties accountable.”
</P><P>What followed was a fact-packed cram session on the history of <mark>climate</mark> science. It was by turns instructive, remedial, repetitive, and just plain zany. The presentations included whirlwind reviews of the giants of <mark>climate</mark> science: Joseph Fournier (who first described the greenhouse effect in the early 19th century), John Tyndall (who determined that <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is heat trapping), Svante Arrhenius (the first to calculate the degree to which <mark>CO2</mark> traps energy), and David Keeling (who began measuring global <mark>CO2</mark> concentrations in the mid-20th century). At one point, a climatologist from the University of Oxford, Myles Allen, tried to use his limbs and head to demonstrate how a <mark>CO2</mark> molecule traps energy within the atmosphere, a move that he conceded felt like dancing “the funky chicken.”
</P><P>For the most part, the <mark>climate</mark> tutorial didn’t illuminate any new science. But it did succeed in revealing the <mark>carbon</mark> polluters’ new rhetorical tactic, now that the evidence linking fossil-fuel combustion to rising temperatures is overwhelming: Acknowledge the basics of <mark>climate</mark> science, while playing up the uncertainty of some <mark>climate</mark> research.		</P><P>Ted Boutrous, an attorney representing <mark>Chevron</mark> Oil, began his presentation by stating, “<mark>Chevron</mark> accepts the scientific consensus regarding <mark>climate change</mark>. And that has been <mark>Chevron</mark>’s position for over a decade.” He later said, “From <mark>Chevron</mark>’s perspective, there is no debate about <mark>climate</mark> science.”
</P><P>Boutrous then went on to deliver a nearly two-hour meta-review of the various reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>. It was a deft presentation, with the <mark>Chevron</mark> attorney admitting that the human contribution to <mark>climate change</mark> is real even as he emphasized the uncertainties about the magnitude and timing of impacts.				</P><P>Using the IPCC reports as a kind of sock puppet (whenever Judge Alsup asked about <mark>Chevron</mark>’s views, the attorney fell back on the intergovernmental report), Boutrous showed himself to be a master at cherry-picking. Reading directly from the IPCC’s latest report, he focused attention on scientific disagreement about warming temperatures’ impact on ice melt in Antarctica, “In some aspects of the <mark>climate</mark> systems, including Antarctic warming, …confidence in attribution to human influence remains low due to modeling uncertainties and low agreement among scientific studies.” He twice displayed a slide headlined, “Key Uncertainties.”
</P><P>The counsel for Oakland and San Francisco were probably glad to be batting last. Don Weubbels, an atmospheric scientist who led one of the very IPCC groups the <mark>Chevron</mark> attorney was so fond of quoting, had the last word. In a mellifluous tenor polished through lecturing to generations of University of Illinois students, Wuebbels skewered the defense presentation and reminded the bench, “The science doesn’t stop at 2012.” Wuebbles outlined how global warming is accelerating and noted that 2017 was the most destructive on record for natural disasters in the United States. He finished with a slide about hoaw <mark>climate change</mark> has fueled:<SPAN style=""margin-left: 45px;"">§ Heat waves increasing</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

He asked each side to discuss the history of <mark>climate</mark> science and answer eight specific questions, such as: “What are the main sources of heat that account for the incremental rise in temperature on Earth?”</P><P>Boutrous denied that oil companies are responsible for sea-level rise or any associated property damages in California. Based on news reports, he argued from authority, invoking the  U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>’s (IPCC) and its Fifth Assessment Report, published in 2013.</P><P>Specifically, Boutrous cited IPCC data showing decreases in sea level off the West Coast during 1993-2012, highlighted uncertainties in IPCC projections of future sea-level rise, and denied that the IPCC holds any company or group of companies responsible for <mark>climate change</mark>: “The IPCC does not say it’s the extraction and production of oil that is driving these emissions,” he explained. “It’s economic activity that creates the demand for energy, and that leads to emissions.”</P><P>The last point is a good one. Global emission levels reflect the purchasing decisions of billions of customers, who include city officials in San Francisco and Oakland, not the machinations of energy company executives. Consumption and therefore emissions tend to increase when energy prices fall, and decrease when prices rise. If <mark>climate</mark> scolds were consistent, they would applaud high gasoline prices. Instead, they <A href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2006/05/ftc-releases-report-its-investigation-gasoline-price-manipulation"">falsely accuse</A> oil companies of colluding to “<A href=""https://nypost.com/2017/09/17/schumer-urges-feds-to-watch-price-gouging-on-big-oil/"">gouge</A>” consumer.</P><P>Nonetheless, touting the IPCC is not a winning strategy. When it suits their convenience, as was the case at the tutorial, eco-litigants can always cherry pick more recent studies to claim <mark>climate change</mark> is “worse than we [i.e., the IPCC] thought.”</P><P>More importantly, despite acknowledging uncertainties, IPCC reports project severe <mark>climate change</mark> impacts by the late 21<SUP>st</SUP> century. The core IPCC narrative supports the <mark>climate</mark> litigators rather than <mark>Chevron</mark>.</P><P>In addition, if the oil companies are going to argue from authority, then they should retain credentialed scientists to present their case. That’s what Oakland and San Francisco did. Instead, the oil companies sent a lawyer. Also, if they accept “consensus” as evidentiary, then at least present a united front. Instead, representatives from BP, Conoco Phillips, ExxonMobil, and Royal Dutch Shell said not a word, arousing suspicions that their views may differ from <mark>Chevron</mark>’s.</P><P>Judge Alsup gave the other defendants two weeks to submit details on any points of disagreement with <mark>Chevron</mark>. “Otherwise, I'm going to assume you're in agreement,” he said. “You can't get away with sitting there in silence and then later say, ‘He wasn't speaking for us.’”</P><P>Rather than endorse a “consensus” that everybody knows fuels <mark>climate</mark> litigation, <mark>Chevron</mark> and the other defendants should challenge the scientific bona fides of mainstream climatology. No, I am not suggesting they deny the reality of man-made global warming or speculate about what percentage of recent warming is natural rather than anthropogenic.</P><P>The key point, as explained by Cato Institute scientist <A href=""http://go.cei.org/e/287682/ational-<mark>climate</mark>-assessment-pdf/c9xtf/141452670"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Michaels</A>, is that the IPCC and other self-appointed <mark>climate</mark> authorities use an unscientific methodology. The vast majority of <mark>climate</mark> models “hind-cast” <A href=""http://go.cei.org/e/287682/Y-WState-JChristy-20170329-pdf/c9xth/141452670"" target=""_blank"">two-to-three times</A> as much global warming as has actually occurred in recent decades. Only one model, known as INM-CM4, accurately tracks warming trends both at the surface and in the bulk atmosphere. Instead of using that model to project future warming and <mark>climate change</mark> impacts, the IPCC takes the average of all models, nearly all of which are overheated.</P><P>Compounding the error, mainstream assessment reports typically run the ensemble of overheated models with a “baseline” scenario, called <A href=""https://www.cato.org/blog/time-cool-it-uns-moribund-high-end-global-warming-emissions-scenario"">RCP8.5</A>, in which coal remains the dominant electricity fuel through the end of the century. Just about every energy expert expects natural gas to continue replacing coal as the world’s major electricity fuel. </P><P>When the INM-CM4 model is run with a realistic emission scenario, projected 21<SUP>st</SUP> century warming drops to about 1.5°C. In other words, the world meets the most “ambitious” goal of the <A href=""https://cei.org/expert/marlo-lewis-jr"">Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement</A> but without any punitive <mark>climate</mark> regulations or taxes.</P><P>Michaels, in comments submitted on the U.S. government’s Fourth National Assessment (NA4) report, summarizes the argument energy freedom advocates should make to win in the California litigation and, indeed, in the court of public opinion:</P><P style=""margin-left: 40px;"">NA4 suffers from a fundamental methodological flaw in assuming that models making large bulk errors are representative of a range of future warming. . . . NA4 also pays inadequate attention to the implications of an ongoing seismic shift in world energy towards natural gas. Warming predicted by the one model that does not suffer the bulk errors, coupled with a slightly lower concentration pathway because of forecast switching from coal to natural gas, becomes a net benefit rather than a social cost.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""golden-two-region golden-two-region--second sidebar-region""><DIV class=""contents-container contents-container-pane-blog-by-issues-panel-pane-4""><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-views-panes pane-blog-by-issues-panel-pane-4""><DIV class=""panel-pane-title-container""><H2 class=""pane-title"">More OpenMarket</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
