Oakland and San Francisco intend to pin at least some of the blame on large fossil fuel companies, including BP PLC, Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips Co., ExxonMobil Corp., and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> PLC. The California cities have filed lawsuits claiming damages related to <mark>climate change</mark> they say the companies caused. In a savvy move, both engaged activist lawyer Matt Pawa to argue their case, tying their efforts to the #ExxonKnew movement.</P><P><A href=""https://www.eenews.net/assets/2017/09/20/document_pm_02.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">San Francisco’s lawsuit</A> explains the line of reasoning for the suit: Fossil fuels cause global warming, the oil companies refined and extracted “massive amounts of fossil fuels despite having full knowledge…that fossil fuels would cause global warming,” and San Francisco and Oakland “will incur serious <mark>climate change</mark> injuries that will require billions in expenditures to abate the global warming nuisance.” The lawsuit describes the impending floods as “an unlawful public nuisance of the first order,” for which it claims oil companies are responsible.</P><P>A <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">2015 investigation</A> by <EM>Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News</EM> about Exxon’s failure to publicize its research about <mark>climate change</mark> forms the basis of the #<A href=""http://exxonknew.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ExxonKnew movement</A>, which calls for a federal investigation to determine whether Exxon “intentionally misled the public about <mark>climate change</mark> and fossil fuels.” Pawa has <A href=""http://exxonknew.org/exposing-exxons-lies/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">previously briefed</A> attorneys general and others on Exxon’s activities, and is <A href=""http://www.ciel.org/about-us/environmental-law-board-of-trustees/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">on the board</A> of the Center for International Environmental Law.</P><P>Greenpeace’s <mark>Climate</mark> Liability Campaigner, <A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/its-time-to-hold-these-<mark>climate</mark>-deadbeats-responsible-greenpeace-response-to-sf-oakland-<mark>climate</mark>-lawsuits/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Naomi Ages, said</A>, “It’s time to hold these <mark>climate</mark> deadbeats accountable. Greenpeace applauds San Francisco and Oakland.”</P><P>As <EM>NPQ</EM> recently noted, the costs of dealing with the <A href=""https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2017/09/06/hurricanes-wildfires-ravage-country-fueled-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">increased flooding</A> from <mark>climate change</mark> and related disastrous weather are enormous, and <A href=""https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2017/09/15/no-denying-fundamental-truths-<mark>climate</mark>-change-endangered-cities/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">cities are struggling</A> with how to protect themselves. As Jeff Stein of <EM>Vox</EM><A href=""https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/29/16215012/hurricane-harvey-congress-funding"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">explained</A>, FEMA funding is both insufficient and difficult to obtain and administer. Larry Larson, senior policy adviser at the Association of State Floodplain Managers, told Stein, “I would venture to say that a lot of the facilities damaged in Harvey have been rebuilt at least once, if not twice, with taxpayer dollars.”</P><P>Oakland and San Francisco, along with a few other cities that have filed similar suits, aim to change that. They want fossil fuel companies, not taxpayers, to pay for raising buildings, constructing sea walls, and implementing other programs to help protect them from flooding.</P><P>According to <EM>Scientific American</EM>, “A spokesman for <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> called <mark>climate change</mark> a ‘complex societal challenge’ to be addressed by governments, ‘not by the courts.’” Of course, that would work out pretty well for <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> and its competitors, since President Trump’s government <A href=""https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2017/05/01/<mark>climate</mark>-epa-finally-scrubs-<mark>climate</mark>-change-related-pages-website/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">has made it plain</A> they have no intention of taking action on <mark>climate change</mark>. Instead, <A href=""https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2017/06/02/active-democracy-fills-leadership-vacuum-wake-paris-withdrawal/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">municipalities have stepped up</A> to implement the Paris accords and other programs that protect their citizens and infrastructure.</P><P>If Oakland and San Francisco are to be successful, Pawa and the other plaintiff representatives will need to overturn a precedent set in 2012 in <A href=""http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1612125.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><EM>Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp</EM></A>.

Will the deep coffers of Exxon Mobil and BP fund the salvation of coastal cities? Are the companies that extract and refine fossil fuels as culpable as the people that consume them or the government that fails to regulate them? All of these questions and more will be debated in the coming months, as the water levels rise.—Erin Rubin</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

And increasingly we’re seeing their chief executives responding. The question is though, how much is for real and what's just greenwash?</P><P>It’s been just over a year since the Paris <mark>climate</mark> deal was agreed in December 2015 and slowly corporate annual reports are being filed. In these, companies take stock of the year’s changes and assess the future risks to their business. Meanwhile new strategies and corporate statements are being issued. Statoil recently <A href=""https://www.desmog.co.uk/2017/03/10/Statoil-Claims-to-Care-About-<mark>Climate</mark>-Change-Commits-Future-to-Oil-and-Gas"">released a <mark>climate</mark> roadmap</A> and ConocoPhillips has come out <A href=""http://www.smartbrief.com/s/2017/03/us-shouldnt-exit-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-says-conocophillips-ceo"">in support of the <SPAN class=""caps"">US</SPAN> remaining part of the Paris Agreement</A>.</P><P>But what are we to make of all of this? Do the actions of these oil giants match the big words put out by their chief executives when it comes to <mark>climate change</mark>? Has anything really changed since Paris?</P><H3><STRONG>Royal Dutch Shell</STRONG></H3><P>It feels like Shell is going through a bit of an identity crisis. On the one hand, it’s been pretty clear about the risk <mark>climate change</mark> poses to its business and the need to transition to renewable energy. But on the other hand, it sees this as a slow, decadal process and has a record of lobbying against <mark>climate</mark> action.</P><P>Last week headlines were made when Shell announced it was selling off most of its Canadian oil sands assets. Mixed in with this also was <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shell-divestiture-cdn-natural-rsc-idUSKBN16G0PH"">the news</A> that it would now be tying 10 percent of its directors’ bonuses to how well they manage greenhouse gas emissions in their operations.</P><P>It also aims to invest $1 billion in renewable energy by the end of the decade.</P><P>But a look at the bigger picture shows that while these are steps in the right direction, they’re relatively small steps given Shell’s total annual spending comes to $25 billion.</P><P>And according to <A href=""http://energypost.eu/<mark>carbon</mark>-capture-and-use-how-<mark>climate</mark>-friendly-is-it/"">a recent article</A> written by Shell’s <mark>climate</mark> advisor David Hone, the company has “no immediate plans to move to a net-zero emissions portfolio over our investment horizon of 10-20 years”.</P><P>That said, Shell appears to be somewhat ahead of the curve compared to other oil majors. Maybe it's making up for lost time, or perhaps it doesn't want to be left in the dust. Either way, it's not entirely burying its head in the sand. In its <A href=""https://www.desmog.co.uk/2016/03/12/shell-and-chevron-two-oil-giants-two-very-different-approaches-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">annual report last year</A> for the year up to December 2015 it was the first company to recognize that policy action and legal risks due to rising <mark>climate change</mark> concerns are mounting. These same concerns are repeated in <A href=""http://www.shell.com/media/annual-reports-and-publications.html"">this year’s report</A>.</P><P>However, this comes after the <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/28/shell-knew-oil-giants-1991-film-warned-<mark>climate</mark>-change-danger"">Guardian revealed</A> that Shell knew of the impact fossil fuels would have on the <mark>climate</mark> as far back as 1991. In a film on temperature and sea level rise the oil giant accurately predicts what scientists now all agree on about <mark>climate</mark> change.</P><P>Yet, despite the company’s own data, it has spent decades investing in unconventional oil and gas projects. Projects which it has always known are incompatible with tackling <mark>climate</mark> change.</P><H3><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN></STRONG></H3><P>Meanwhile, <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN> is facing <A href=""http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bp-faces-questions-on-growth-prospects-dfdwbw6p5"">significant pressure to boost production</A>. Part of this effort means it continues to expand into more and more challenging projects in search of bigger returns. But it’s having some trouble.</P><P>After strong public opposition to its plans to drill in the pristine waters of the Great Australian Bight it pulled out of the deepwater venture. And now it’s planning a similarly controversial project: drilling for oil near a <A href=""http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2017/01/30/amazon-reef-mouth-bp-total-oil-drilling/"">recently discovered coral reef</A> off the coast of Brazil.</P><P>The company also isn’t performing as well as it would have hoped, with share prices currently sitting 30 percent lower than before its Deepwater Horizon disaster.  All of this has led to rumours of takeovers, with <A href=""http://www.standard.co.uk/business/bp-takeover-chatter-bubbles-back-to-surface-a3486576.html"">reports last week</A> that Exxon was eyeing up the British oil giant.</P><P>And as it continues to lay off workers from its drilling operations on the North Sea, a <A href=""https://www.desmog.co.uk/2017/03/13/revealed-bp-puts-branding-local-schools-while-cutting-north-sea-jobs"">DeSmog <SPAN class=""caps"">UK</SPAN> investigation</A> shows <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN> has been working hard to boost its social license by putting <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN>-branded tutors in primary and secondary schools all across Aberdeen.</P><P>In the <SPAN class=""caps"">US</SPAN>, however, <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN> chief executive Bob Dudley seems encouraged by the change in winds that came with a new White House administration. <A href=""http://www.naturalgasworld.com/bp-rebuilds-for-growth-36200"">Dudley recently said</A> that the political situation meant business is much more open now, saying that the White House is “very interested” in <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN>, “more so than at any times in the last eight years”.</P><P>As <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN> continues to push into riskier projects – and riskier in all senses of the word, from its operations to the <mark>climate</mark> and the marine environment – it will be interesting to see what <A href=""http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/investors/results-and-reporting/annual-report.html"">its annual report</A> (yet to be published) makes of all of this. Last year’s simply recognizes the impact that complying with <mark>climate change</mark> regulations and laws may have on its profit margin.</P><H3><STRONG>Chevron</STRONG></H3><P>Compared to last year, Chevron’s come a long way. Whereas its chief executive John Watson boasted last year that the world will always need Big Oil this year it too has publicly recognized to its investors that <mark>climate change</mark> lawsuits can pose a risk to its profits.</P><P>In its <A href=""http://investor.chevron.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=130102&amp;p=irol-SECText&amp;TEXT=aHR0cDovL2FwaS50ZW5rd2l6YXJkLmNvbS9maWxpbmcueG1sP2lwYWdlPTExNDE2ODY2JkRTRVE9MCZTRVE9MCZTUURFU0M9U0VDVElPTl9FTlRJUkUmc3Vic2lkPTU3#sC86D008E5E23527992562203BD19296B"">annual report</A> for the year up to December 2016 it states: “increasing attention to <mark>climate change</mark> risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and, potentially, private litigation against the company.”</P><P>But amidst growing demand from shareholders for corporate disclosure on <mark>climate</mark> risks, Chevron this month said in a <A href=""https://www.chevron.com/-/media/chevron/shared/documents/<mark>climate</mark>-risk-perspective.pdf"">quietly released report</A> that a transition to lower-<mark>carbon</mark> energy sources would pose only a “minimal risk” to its operations because it’s investing in these options too. It then goes on to explain that oil and gas will remain the fundamental energy sources.</P><H3><STRONG>ExxonMobil</STRONG></H3><P>Like <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN>, Exxon fails to go beyond the impact of <mark>climate</mark> regulations on its profits. The company however continues to be in the spotlight, from investigations into its long <A href=""//www.desmogblog.com/exxonmobil-funding-<mark>climate</mark>-science-denial"">history of funding <mark>climate</mark> denial</A> to former chief executive <A href=""//www.desmogblog.com/rex-tillerson"">Rex Tillerson</A> becoming part of the new White House administration – the same Rex Tillerson who, as Exxon's chief, <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tillerson-<mark>climate</mark>change-idUSKBN16L06J"">went by the alias 'Wayne Tracker'</A> when emailing colleagues to discuss <mark>climate</mark> change.</P><P>Since Tillerson left the helm, Exxon has made some attempts to improve its <mark>climate</mark> credentials. The new chief executive Darren Woods publicly endorsed the Paris <mark>climate</mark> deal and just weeks after he took over from Tillerson, Susan Avery, a <mark>climate</mark> scientist, was appointed to the company’s board.</P><P>This comes after the company’s shareholders <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/exxons-ceo-just-won-his-shareholders-rejected-<mark>climate</mark>-change-proposals-573d12dde5e7#.egn8vq2r5"">failed to do just</A> that during Exxon’s annual general meeting last summer. During this meeting three other <mark>climate</mark> related initiatives were voted down including one to stress test the business to avoid 2C warming.</P><P>However, <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/business/energy-environment/darren-woods-exxon-mobil-investors.html"">no major shift on strategy</A> was announced during Woods' first speech on March 1 since being appointed to lead Exxon. Instead, investment priorities will continue to be in oil and gas.</P><P>The company also appears to be taking full advantage of the new <SPAN class=""caps"">US</SPAN> administration’s warm welcome to oil lobbyists as it <A href=""//www.desmogblog.com/2017/03/12/exxon-peabody-epa-science-advisory-board"">pushes for weaker regulations</A> on the oil and gas industry.</P><P><SPAN style=""font-size:11px;"">Photo: <A href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/drewkolb/7345933648/"">Drew Kolb</A> via Flickr | <SPAN class=""caps"">CC</SPAN> 2.0</SPAN></P><DIV id=""block-block-109"" class=""block block-block first odd""><DIV class=""inline-newsletter-form us""><SPAN class=""inline-newsletter-label"">Get Weekly News Updates</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

				Waves crash against a seawall along the Embarcadero in San Francisco in 2010.									<P class=""credits"">Eric Risberg / AP</P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class=""entry-content single-post-content""><P>SAN FRANCISCO — Outside a courtroom where a much-anticipated court hearing on <mark>climate</mark> science took place on Wednesday is an old photo of San Francisco’s coastline. Dated 1865, it features an area of the city known as North Beach, which back then was covered in ramshackle wooden houses on a sandy slope nuzzled up against the shore. Since then, the coastline has been extended, filled in with sand (<A href=""https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/making-up-ground/"">and most likely boats and other strange things</A>) to stretch several blocks farther into the brackish waters of the San Francisco Bay. A sea wall, <A href=""http://abc7news.com/politics/san-franciscos-cracking-seawall-needs-$250m-makeover/3235921/"">badly in need of repair</A>, keeps the bay at bay.</P><P>That very sea wall is at the heart of the court case — The People of the State of California v. BP P.L.C. et al. — that was the reason for Wednesday’s spectacle. The cities of Oakland and San Francisco are suing the five biggest fossil fuel companies on the planet — BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> — for <A href=""http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/environment/article206025399.html"">billions of dollars</A> for past damages and to prevent future flooding from sea level rise. Since the companies extracted fuel that altered the planet, the argument goes, they should pay for the consequences. It’s a modern version of “you break it, you buy it.” The oil companies have filed to dismiss the lawsuit on many grounds, including that it’s the government’s job to set and enforce <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels — not theirs.</P><P>On Wednesday, no one was yet on trial. <A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber"">U.S. District Judge William Alsup</A> made that very clear to the throng of spectators who filled the chambers, a spillover courtroom and the halls outside. Instead, we were there to see a tutorial, an effort to help this self-described “poor judge” learn the science behind the case. It was going to be a boring morning full of numbers and diagrams, he warned the audience.</P><P>But in this polarized moment, a public tussling over the basics of <mark>climate</mark> science, however cursory, is anything but boring. And as each side in the case presented a history of <mark>climate change</mark> science, it was striking just how much the two sides agreed on: <mark>Climate change</mark> is happening, and humans are in large part responsible. But that’s not really what this court case is about. Rather, it’s about who knew what and when, how much uncertainty there is around future predictions and who should be held responsible (and liable) for a future with higher seas and more extreme weather events. That’s where the cities’ and corporations’ use of evidence diverged.</P><P>First up: the scientists.</P><P>At a big rectangular table in the center of the room, the cities were represented by Steve Berman, a lawyer known for his ability to <A href=""https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43qw3j/meet-the-lawyer-trying-to-make-big-oil-pay-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">get big settlements out of big corporations</A>, as well as some of their own lawyers. But aside from a few introductory remarks, Berman left the talking to a few of the world’s leading experts on <mark>climate change</mark>. First, he called Myles Allen, who is a professor of geosystem science at Oxford University and was tasked with providing a historiography of <mark>climate change</mark> research.</P><P>In true scientist fashion, the talk was filled with jargon and complicated scientific concepts. Alsup, who made clear that he would call out confusing charts or unclear explanations, asked Allen what made <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, which is emitted from burning fossil fuels and have led to a warming planet, special. Allen, equal to the task, began to pantomime his answer. Arms stretched out to the side, fists in a ball, he shimmied left and right, showing how the charge on a <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide molecule could be unevenly distributed, absorbing the infrared waves that are naturally emitted from Earth, unlike oxygen and nitrogen, whose charge is symmetric. That infrared gets trapped within Earth’s atmosphere, instead of escaping, causing the planet to warm.</P><P>After walking through key figures and research from the last century of <mark>climate</mark> science, Allen concluded by saying that we’ve known that the planet was warming since the 1970s. And crucially, he said, we knew back then that we might not know how bad <mark>climate change</mark> would be, or be able to feel and see the effects of that warming, until it was already too late.</P><P>The next speaker, Gary Griggs, an oceanographer who works at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was deep into an explanation of sea level rise when a loud, piercing alarm went off. “Coastal flood alert,” Alsup quipped as soon as it finished. The room broke out in laughter. It wasn’t clear whether it was real or a drill, but nature has a way of making itself known.</P><P>Next up: the lawyers.</P><P>While the cities relied on scientists, the energy companies relied on lawyers. One in particular: Theodore Boutrous, a lawyer for Chevron (which is headquartered in the Bay Area) did all of the talking. And he got straight to the point, answering the question on everyone’s mind: Yes, Chevron accepts the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>. And in honor of that consensus, he’d be relying almost entirely on the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, a United Nations-backed consortium meant to provide a scientific view of what <mark>climate change</mark> is doing to the planet, to lay out his understanding of the science and the history.</P><P>He kicked off by quoting from the IPCC’s <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/"">most recent report</A>, from 2013, citing population growth and economic changes as the most important drivers of <mark>climate change</mark>. The report, he noted, says nothing about fossil-fuel extraction as a driver of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Boutrous offered a history lesson that had a lot in common with Allen’s, but with a much greater focus on the uncertainty around both the science and the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on the Bay Area. He illustrated that uncertainty in various ways, describing how theories that posited alternative roles of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere held sway through at least the 1950s. Boutros also showed how actual temperatures hadn’t been as extreme as many <mark>climate</mark> forecasts predicted in the years leading up to the report. Alsup asked if his point was that the models exaggerated the impact of humans on the <mark>climate</mark>. “Instead of doom and gloom, it’s just gloom?” he asked the lawyer. Boutrous chuckled and moved on.</P><P>Boutrous concluded by showing a map of sea level rise, saying that sea levels had fallen around San Francisco in the years leading up to the 2013 IPCC report. There’s a lot of uncertainty about the future, he concluded, noting that San Francisco and Oakland had reported that <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-municipalities-debt-disclosures-contrast-with-<mark>climate</mark>-warnings-1515456551"">exact message to bond investors</A> in 2017, when the cities said they couldn’t predict whether major flooding or storms might have a major, adverse impact on the local economy.</P><P>Finally, the tutorial pivoted back to the cities, so it pivoted back to the scientists. Don Wuebbles, who is a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois and co-wrote the 2007 IPCC report that helped the organization win the Nobel Peace Prize, was the final scientist called by the cities. He began by pointing out that he’d also led the writing of the first chapter in the 2013 IPCC report that Boutrous had so carefully recounted. “I think it’s important to recognize that science did not stop; there’s a lot we’ve learned in the last five years,” Wuebbles said. That’s why he’d be using <A href=""https://science2017.globalchange.gov/"">data from the U.S. Global Change Research Program</A>, which produces more frequent, national reports on <mark>climate change</mark> to make his presentation.</P><P>The year after the most recent IPCC report was published was the hottest on record, Wuebbles told the court. Then 2015 topped 2014, and 2016 topped 2015. Temperatures are going up, precipitation is increasing, extreme events are more frequent. Looking at a broader set of years, sea level has risen around the San Francisco Bay. Alsup asked Wuebbles whether he disagreed with Boutrous’s recounting of the science.</P><P>Not really, since the lawyer had based his presentation on the IPCC, and a report that Wuebbles was heavily involved with. But Wuebbles’s point was that the IPCC report doesn’t tell all of what we know in 2018. The IPCC report might not be wrong, but that doesn’t mean that it gives the best picture of what’s right.</P><P>As the tutorial concluded, Alsup had a few final remarks. “I wore my science tie today,” he said, pointing to the solar system hanging around his neck before standing up to leave. “I hope someone takes note of that.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV class=""mini-bio""><P>Anna Maria Barry-Jester reports on public health, food and culture for FiveThirtyEight.  <SPAN class=""twitter""><A href=""https://twitter.com/annabarryjester"" target=""_blank""><SPAN class=""twitter-username"">@annabarryjester</SPAN></A></SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class=""tags""><P class=""filed-under"">Filed under</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The <EM>how</EM> and the <EM>what</EM> are up to the management of Shell. It is up to them to set GHG emission reduction targets and to develop activities to attain these targets.</P><P>This supporting statement serves to offer rationale, elaborate on transparency, and recommend metrics to align these targets with the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement.</P><P><STRONG>Context</STRONG></P><UL><LI>In Paris, in December 2015, during the twenty-first Conference of the Parties (COP21), representatives of 195 countries reaffirmed the goal of limiting global temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and agreed to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. COP21 also agreed to aim for a global net-zero-emission energy system.</LI><LI>In May 2015, by means of a shareholder resolution submitted by the Aiming for A investor coalition, shareholders directed that annual reporting will include information relating to <mark>climate change</mark>, such as emissions management, asset portfolio resilience, and investment strategies. Setting further targets on scopes 1, 2, and 3 is the next step.</LI><LI>Major institutional investors have announced that they will drastically cut the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of their investment portfolios with the aim of reducing the <mark>climate</mark> risks in them.</LI></UL><P><STRONG>Transparency</STRONG></P><P>We the shareholders request that the company publish company-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets according to the following 3 scopes:</P><UL><LI>Scope 1: direct emissions from the facilities under Shell’s operational control or the equity boundary,</LI><LI>Scope 2: indirect emissions from the facilities of others that provide electricity or heat and steam to Shell’s operations,</LI><LI>Scope 3: emissions that Shell estimates come from the use of Shell’s refinery products and natural gas products.</LI></UL><P>In order to align its emission reduction targets with a well-below-2°C pathway, we request the company to base these targets on tangible metrics such as the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), or to use any other metrics the company finds practical to align its targets with a well-below-2°C pathway. For example, the INDC of Europe calls for 40% emission reduction by 2030 and 80-95% by 2050, relative to 1990 levels. While the combined INDCs are not enough to get on a well-below-2°C pathway, these commitments may be ratcheted up. The company could use metrics of the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) as well. For example, to limit global warming to well below 2°C, the IPCC estimates that 40-70% reduction in GHG emissions globally is needed by 2050, relative to 2010 levels. In the light of changing technological drive, scientific progress, and incrementally rising policy commitments, Shell should review its GHG emission reduction targets regularly.</P><P><STRONG>Risks</STRONG></P><P>If actions to get on a well-below-2°C pathway are taken too slowly, this may lead to abrupt adjustments, resulting in costly shocks. An orderly transition should start with the expression of clear medium- and long-term targets. We fully realize that these targets will be just dots on the horizon and that the road leading there has to be discovered, but the longer the company waits, the harder it will be to attain the well-below-2°C pathway and the more disruptive the transition will be.</P><P>The political pledge to limit <mark>climate change</mark> to well below 2°C, the resulting future legislation, and the decreasing costs of renewable energy add to the risk that capital expenditures in fossil fuel projects will become stranded assets.</P><P><STRONG>Opportunities</STRONG></P><P>Taking leadership in the global energy transition could increase the brand value of Shell. The company could distinguish itself from its competitors if customers knew that part of the profits from fossil fuels would be invested in energy sources that limit global warming.</P><P>Shell is accustomed to exploring for oil and gas resources. We encourage the company to explore new business models. Some investments will turn out to be profitable; some not, as is the case in the exploration for oil and gas.</P><P>Shell’s financial results greatly depend on the price of oil. Diversification of the energy system could turn out to be an opportunity to decrease risks and create the cash engines of the future.</P><P><STRONG>Support</STRONG></P><P>We encourage Shell to show leadership by enhancing its capability to innovate and make use of potential opportunities in a transforming energy landscape over the coming decades. We would welcome further alignment between the company’s strategic positions vis-à-vis emerging energy technologies that stand to benefit from the energy transition. With its decades of experience and expertise as an innovator, its global reach, its financial capital, and its human capital, Shell is excellently positioned to make use of these developments by applying new technologies and setting up related business models. We encourage Shell to set targets that are inspirational for society, employees, and shareholders, allowing Shell to meet increasing demand for energy while reducing GHG emissions.</P><P><STRONG>You have our support.</STRONG></P></DIV><DIV class=""fusion-sharing-box share-box""><H4>Deel dit verhaal, kies uw platform!</H4></DIV><DIV class=""related-posts single-related-posts""><DIV class=""fusion-title title""><H2 class=""title-heading-left"">Gerelateerde berichten</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

And what we learned from the tutorial is that these companies are likely to use the agreed-upon science to make the case that they shouldn’t have to pay for the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P id=""JNGS92"">If the cities’ lawsuit survives a barrage of motions to dismiss, they will still have to show that oil majors deliberately sowed confusion on <mark>climate change</mark> in bad faith.Let’s walk through what we know about the various arguments so far. </P><H3 id=""9FFvBv"">Oil companies agree on the science but not the politics</H3><P id=""AWIkgM"">The fundamental argument from the oil companies is that <mark>climate change</mark> is a global problem that needs a political solution, and you can’t solve a political problem in court and you certainly can’t blame the oil companies for selling a product that everyone wants to buy. </P><P id=""BDk4p1"">Theodore Boutrous, a <A href=""https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/boutrous-jr-theodore-j/"">seasoned litigator</A> who’s argued cases before the US Supreme Court, presented on behalf of Chevron. “Chevron accepts the consensus in the scientific communities on <mark>climate change</mark>,” he said last week. “There’s no debate about <mark>climate</mark> science.”</P><P id=""hZydq0"">He built his presentation around the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>’s <A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/"">fifth assessment report</A>, published in 2013, which has more than 800 authors and cites more than 9,200 scientific papers (he also rewatched <A href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/""><EM>An Inconvenient Truth</EM></A>). The report states that the IPCC is “95 percent certain that humans are the main cause of current global warming” and remains one of the most robust works in <mark>climate</mark> science. </P><P id=""VqGdix"">But as Boutrous detailed the history of how <mark>climate</mark> scientists like Svante Arrhenius and John Tyndall developed their theories, he also noted that previous IPCC reports weren’t always so certain. The 1990 report said that “the observed increase could be largely due to natural variability.” The 1995 report said that signals were emerging that there is human influence on the <mark>climate</mark>. The 2001 report said that warming was “very unlikely” due to natural causes alone. </P><P id=""biLlp4"">The point he was making was that the consensus took time to build, and as the science got better, Chevron moved with it. Past rhetoric from oil companies reflected this uncertainty in the science, and Chevron now has a <A href=""https://www.chevron.com/corporate-responsibility/<mark>climate</mark>-change"">comprehensive strategy</A> for managing <mark>climate</mark> risks, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions. </P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>Chevron’s El Segundo Refinery covers approximately 1,000 acres with more than 1,100 miles of pipelines and is capable of refining nearly 270,000 barrels of crude oil per day.</FIGCAPTION><CITE>David McNew/Getty Images</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""H1Zi51"">Another key point Boutrous made was that these human-sourced greenhouse gas emissions are due to growing wealth and development, of which fossil fuel combustion is a symptom, not a cause. “Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever,” the IPCC reported in <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/news_and_events/docs/ar5/ar5_syr_headlines_en.pdf"">2014</A>. </P><P id=""X2JhZ3"">“It’s just a facet of human existence,” Boutrous told Vox. “It’s an issue for policymakers to address.”</P><P id=""Hx9n7I"">And looking toward the future, it’s unclear how <mark>climate change</mark> will impact San Francisco and Oakland in particular. San Francisco, in its complaint, included a map showing water inundation for the city with 66 inches of sea level rise plus 42 inches of flooding from a <A href=""https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/28/16211392/100-500-year-flood-meaning"">100-year storm</A>, a scenario they called “unlikely, but possible.”</P><P id=""XkjoUu"">Boutrous pointed out that while global sea levels are rising on average, some evidence shows that sea levels have fallen in specific regions, and coastal flooding in places like the San Francisco Bay Area is also a function of local conditions like <A href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180307141411.htm"">land subsidence</A>. </P><P id=""6ChfQj"">So for San Francisco and Oakland to build a claim on harms from future sea level rise is a stretch when there is so much uncertainty as to what will happen, the argument goes.</P><P id=""ke9AHk"">Boutrous noted that when the judge asked the scientists in the room if they disagreed with what he presented, they didn’t question his reading of the facts. </P><P id=""JqqmAq"">That signals that progress in these lawsuits isn’t going to hinge on the science so much as an untested legal theory, and that’s where the plaintiffs are on weak footing, according to Boutrous. Holding oil companies liable for producing fossil fuels would also open up cities to liability for building roads and facilitating travel with vehicles that burn those fuels. </P><P id=""0SeikJ"">“Focusing resources on a novel, never-accepted theory just isn’t the way to have a productive chance at really addressing global warming,” Boutrous said. “No tort theory has ever been developed that comes close to covering these issues.” </P><H3 id=""1FjVuh"">The <mark>climate</mark> models have gotten better; the news has gotten worse </H3><P id=""x1ezhd"">But Donald Wuebbles, an author of the 2013 IPCC report as well as the 2017 <A href=""https://science2017.globalchange.gov/"">National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment</A> produced by 13 US federal agencies, noted that while the last IPCC report may be the biggest work in <mark>climate</mark> science, it only incorporated research published as of 2012. </P><P id=""FQVBDN"">“I started up my talk saying that the science didn’t stop in 2012,” Wuebbles, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois, told Vox. “The reality is these assessments are very conservative in their statements.”</P><P id=""bLVr1X"">His end of the tutorial focused on the changes we can anticipate as average temperatures go up around the world, noting that models have become more robust and that scientists are zeroing in on the harms that will be caused by unmitigated changes to the global <mark>climate</mark>. Judge Alsup also asked him about policy questions like which energy sources the United States can use if it gives up coal, oil, and natural gas.</P><P id=""RZz3ub"">The other four defendants had representatives in the room but declined to present, which San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera read as a signal that the other oil companies did not even want to recognize that the court has jurisdiction in such a case. </P><P id=""WstLvp"">But Alsup didn’t let the other oil companies off the hook, as Debra Kahn of <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/2018/03/22/stories/1060077139"">E&amp;E News</A> noted:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P id=""ak4Jix"">Alsup ordered the other defendants in the suit — BP PLC, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> PLC, all of which had representatives at the hearing — to submit briefs within two weeks detailing any points of disagreement with Chevron. “Otherwise, I’m going to assume you’re in agreement,” he said. “You can’t get away with sitting there in silence and then later say, ‘He wasn’t speaking for us.’”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P id=""BtoyKV"">For its part, San Francisco counted the tutorial as a win.</P><P id=""ZOYPmx"">“What we saw today was one oil company begrudgingly accept the scientific consensus while trying to overemphasize the extent of scientific uncertainty,” Herrera said in a statement. “It’s time for them to pay for the seawalls and other infrastructure needed to protect San Francisco and Oakland.”</P><P id=""57ak9s"">The legal maneuvering in this case will continue, and the litigation will likely take <A href=""https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Should-oil-companies-pay-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change-Yes-12768553.php"">years</A> to resolve. Yet the fact that the lawsuits were allowed to proceed this far and that the judge has cemented the science in the courtroom means that the foundation for <mark>climate change</mark> litigation is the strongest it’s ever been. The question for the court is whether it’s strong enough to bill an oil company for a levee.</P><P id=""UOaJ2N"">UCLA’s Carlson said that the defendants will continue to file motions to dismiss the case citing different arguments — that the court doesn’t have jurisdiction in such a case, for instance, or that the defendants don’t have standing, or that federal law doesn’t provide any recourse in such a lawsuit. If none of those motions finds traction in the court, then four to six months from now, the cases move to the discovery phase, where the defendants will have to start producing documents and providing evidence. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

	Can development organizations be more agile and adaptable in a context of constant change?
</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
Constrained by an ageing model of “North-South” assistance and linear thinking, development organizations are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the complexities and interconnectedness of global challenges, from <mark>climate change</mark> to communicable diseases. However, the convergence of three trends promises a structural change in the way development organizations operate: new ways of framing development problems (complexity theory), new information technologies and new types of coalitions. How can development organizations reform themselves to become more effective at improving the world?<P><STRONG>Development organizations exist to help reduce poverty and inequality, and improve human well-being. These problems are becoming increasingly complex as the world grows more connected and volatile.</STRONG> Cross-border flows of goods, services, people and ideas are expanding. Shocks and crises, whether social, political, economic or environmental, are increasingly frequent. As issues become more interconnected and uncertain, the outcomes of development interventions are harder to predict or explain and it is less possible for one actor alone to get things done.</P><P><STRONG>Despite these changes, the operating model of development organizations is constrained by its legacy.</STRONG> This includes centralized assistance from “developed” country governments to “developing” country governments and practices that largely rely on linear models to understand risk and to plan, execute and evaluate action. </P><P>Can development organizations be more agile and adaptable in today’s context of constant change? The combination of three trends that can help frame, understand and respond to complex problems differently offers an opportunity. </P><P><STRONG>First, complexity theory is shifting attention from linear cause and effect relationships to dynamic processes of change.</STRONG> Complexity theory has been used in physics and ecology to study how systems adapt to their environment and cope with uncertainty. Many development scholars argue that complexity theory can strengthen development organizations’ ability to understand dynamic and interconnected development problems and respond more appropriately.</P><P>In <I>Aid on the Edge of Chaos</I>, Ben Ramalingam shows how this approach can be applied to household food security. Traditionally, most of the work concentrated on predicting the occurrence of a food crisis in order to best respond. Analysing and modelling food systems and the multiple connections between socio-economic and ecological factors that contribute to their stability helped create an understanding of households’ capacity to respond to the negative effects of unpredictable climatic shocks. Analysing these variables, which change over time, can support policies to strengthen household resilience and adapt aid interventions more strategically in crisis situations.</P><P><STRONG>Second, new technologies are opening the door to understanding and anticipating complex development problems through the so-called “data revolution”.</STRONG> New types of data and analytical tools have the potential to provide real-time information on complex situations or sudden change and enable quick feedback loops to inform planning and adjust operations. They can also be used to collect citizens’ voices and feedback and integrate them in programme design. </P><P>For instance, mTrac, a Ugandan platform supported by UNICEF, the World Health Organization and the UK Department for International Development (DFID), surveys local health workers via mobile phone text messaging and then alerts national public health officials about malaria outbreaks and medicine stock situations to anticipate and resolve shortages. The share of health facilities that have run out of malaria treatments has fallen from 80% to 15% since it was introduced. The platform also includes an anonymous text message hotline that citizens can use to report any service delivery problems they face. </P><P><STRONG>Third, new kinds of coalitions and movements are emerging as the multiplication of development actors provides opportunities to redefine partnerships.</STRONG> A growing number of actors operating in the development space, from businesses and municipal governments to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and communities, are starting to figure out how to work together on a voluntary basis to solve specific issues. These coalitions of diverse actors bring information, expertise and funding together in ways that cut across domains, geographies and interests. This can lead to new solutions to old problems, e.g. by presenting development challenges as investment opportunities. </P><P>Examples of such projects already delivering results include the <I>Scaling Up Nutrition </I>(SUN) initiative. SUN brings NGOs, businesses and the UN together to accelerate global efforts on under-nutrition. Organized in a global network, each group of actors supports national efforts to improve nutrition by providing funds and expertise. For actors engaged in the SUN initiative, improving nutrition for women and children is no longer only a moral objective, it is also a way to strengthen the workforce and thus contribute to the growth of markets and nations alike. </P><P>None of these trends are completely new in themselves. But their confluence could transform the operating model of development organizations in ways that include more effective delivery of essential services for the poor; changing engagement with the private sector, from donation providers to partners for supply, investment and solution design; changing engagement with citizens, from intervention recipients to agents of change; enhancing knowledge and data systems co-created by a diversity of actors to inform decision-making; and a growing capacity to tackle multi-dimensional problems and operate effectively in uncertain contexts. </P><P>The opportunities presented by these changes come with challenges, notably, that of changing the culture of development organizations to encourage experimentation and value adaptive strategies. The use of big data raises issues of privacy that could, if mishandled, exacerbate discrimination and inequalities. The growing number of actors, coalitions and movements also raises leadership and coordination challenges, in particular for the intergovernmental decision-making structures created for these purposes.</P><P>However, development organizations exist to solve challenges. Leadership from within to overcome existing political and technical tensions could help mobilize these trends and make development more effective.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations” respectively, and entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”.</P><P>In addition to the term “Shell”, in this Report “we”, “us” and “our” are also used to refer to the Company and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement. The companies in which <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> plc has a direct or indirect interest are separate legal entities. Shell subsidiaries’ data include their interests in joint operations.</P><P>We also refer to “Shell’s net <mark>carbon</mark> footprint” in this Report. This includes Shell’s <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers’ <mark>carbon</mark> emissions in supplying energy for that production, and our customers’ <mark>carbon</mark> emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions but, to support society in achieving the Paris Agreement goals, we aim to help and influence such suppliers and consumers to likewise lower theirs. The use of the terminology “Shell’s net <mark>carbon</mark> footprint” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell or its subsidiaries.</P><P>Except where indicated, the figures shown in the tables in this Report are in respect of subsidiaries only, without deduction of any non-controlling interest. However, the term “Shell share” is used for convenience to refer to the volumes of hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s that are produced, processed or sold through subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. All of a subsidiary’s production, processing or sales volumes (including the share of joint operations) are included in the Shell share, even if Shell owns less than 100% of the subsidiary. In the case of joint ventures and associates, however, Shell-share figures are limited only to Shell’s entitlement. In all cases, royalty payments in kind are deducted from the Shell share.</P><P>The financial statements contained in this Report have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. As applied to the financial statements, there are no material differences from IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); therefore, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. IFRS as defined above includes interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee.</P><P>Except where indicated, the figures shown in this Report are stated in US dollars. As used herein all references to “dollars” or “$” are to the US currency.</P><P>This Report contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”, “ambition”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “goals”, “intend”, “may”, “objectives”, “outlook”, “plan”, “probably”, “project”, “risks”, “schedule”, “seek”, “should”, “target”, “will” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this Report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing <mark>climate change</mark>; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; and (m) changes in trading conditions. Also see “Risk factors” on pages 12–16 for additional risks and further discussion. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this Report.

</FIGURE><P>SAN FRANCISCO — Lawyers for some of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, and attorneys representing two Bay Area cities are set to descend on San Francisco Wednesday for what’s expected to be a courtroom first: A daylong lesson on the latest science on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>U.S. District Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California is overseeing a public nuisance lawsuit that the cities of Oakland and San Francisco <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/403/12194/<mark>Climate</mark>-Change-Complaint.pdf"" target=""_blank"">filed last fall</A> against six fossil fuel giants: BP plc, Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips Co., Exxon Mobil Corp. and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> plc. The two waterfront cities are seeking to hold the oil companies liable for the cost of infrastructure upgrades and remediation expected as they deal with effects of rising sea levels.</P><P>In much the same way the judge does in complex technology cases, Alsup has <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/403/documents/403/12194/2018.02.27-135-Notice-re-Tutorial.pdf"">asked the parties</A> for a tutorial. Alsup held a similar session on the laser science underpinning Waymo’s autonomous vehicle trade secret lawsuit against Uber Technologies Inc. and even asked the lawyers handling the litigation challenging the Trump administration’s rollback of the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals to bring him up to speed on the program.</P><P>In the global warming case, Alsup has asked both sides to “trace the history of scientific study of <mark>climate change</mark>” and fill him in on “the best science now available.” Since his initial order asking for the tutorial late last month, Alsup has proposed some <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/403/documents/403/12194/2018.02.27-135-Notice-re-Tutorial.pdf"" target=""_blank"">more specific questions</A>. For example: “Apart from <mark>CO2</mark>, what happens to the collective heat from tail pipe exhausts, engine radiators, and all other heat from combustion of fossil fuels? How, if at all, does this collective heat contribute to warming of the atmosphere?”</P><P>The oil companies’ lengthy line-up of defense counsel filed <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/403/documents/403/12194/AS-FILED-Motion-to-Dismiss-and-Memo-2018.03.20.pdf"" target=""_blank"">a motion to dismiss</A> on Tuesday on the eve of the hearing, which argues a lawsuit is the wrong venue to address global issues like <mark>climate change</mark>. They also argued the emission of greenhouse gasses at the root of the plaintiffs claims are the sort of issue Congress has delegated to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</P><P>“At bottom, plaintiffs are trying to regulate the nationwide—indeed, worldwide—activity of companies that play a key role in virtually every sector of the global economy by supplying the fuels that enable production and <mark>innovation</mark>, literally keep the lights and heat on, power nearly every form of transportation, and form the basic materials from which innumerable consumer, technological, and medical devices are fashioned,” the companies’ lawyers wrote. “The complaints contradict numerous federal statutes and raise myriad constitutional issues.”</P><P>Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, Susman Godfrey and Stern Kilcullen &amp; Rufolo represent Chevron, Arnold &amp; Porter Kaye Scholer represent BP, King &amp; Spalding represents ConocoPhillips, O’Melveny &amp; Myers and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison represent Exxon, and Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson represent <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark>.</P><P>Despite the forceful arguments in the motion to dismiss, the company’s aren’t expected to quibble with the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark> and its human causes.</P><P>Gibson Dunn’s Avi Garbow, who was the EPA’s general counsel during the Obama administration, said Chevron plans to point Alsup to conclusions from the 2013 “Fifth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>,” which formed the scientific underpinning for the Paris Agreement. That includes, Garbow said, the report’s conclusion that it is “extremely likely” human influence has been the dominant cause of warming since the middle of the 20th century. Garbow said that Chevron is ”neither going to understate or overstate” the degree of confidence scientists have on their conclusions about the earth’s changing <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>Matthew Pawa, one of the cities’ outside lawyers at Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, forwarded a request for comment to the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office. In an emailed statement, City Attorney Dennis Herrera said San Francisco looks forward to presenting the science and making its case.</P><P>“We’ll see whether Big Oil acknowledges the scientific consensus and its role in causing <mark>climate change</mark> or doubles down, once again, on deception,” Herrera said. “These companies knew their products were causing sea level rise, and they deceived people about it. Now, that bill has come due.”</P></DIV><BUTTON class=""load_more_shelf btn"">Load More </BUTTON><DIV id=""share-tools-btm"" class=""col-lg-12""><DIV id=""bottom-share"" class=""share-tools text-center""><BUTTON class=""btn tw""> share on twitter</BUTTON></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""author-bio"" id=""about_the_author""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12""><H2 class=""section-title"">Ross Todd</H2></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12""><P>Ross Todd is bureau chief of The Recorder in San Francisco.

Several California municipalities -- San Francisco, Oakland, San Mateo, Imperial Beach and Marin -- previously filed suits against the oil industry over the environmental impact of fossil fuels.</P><P>“Defendants are collectively responsible, through their production, marketing and sale of fossil fuels, for over 11% of all the <mark>carbon</mark> and methane <mark>pollution</mark> from industrial sources that has accumulated in the atmosphere since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution,” lawyers for the city said in a complaint filed in Manhattan on Jan. 9.</P><P>“Defendants are also responsible for leading the public relations strategy for the entire fossil fuel industry, downplaying the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> and promoting fossil fuel use despite the risks,” they said.</P><P>The city hopes to build on legal efforts against producers of asbestos products, cigarettes and lead paint in what would be an extension of legal responsibility.</P><P>“This lawsuit is based on the claim that a corporation that makes a product causing severe harm when used exactly as intended should shoulder the costs of abating that harm,” the city said in the complaint.</P><P>Curtis Smith, a spokesman for Shell, said: “We believe <mark>climate change</mark> is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-<mark>carbon</mark> choices for businesses and consumers, not by the courts.”</P><P>The National Association of Manufacturers also weighed in. “Mayor de Blasio is just the latest mayor to lead his city into misguided litigation against America’s energy manufacturers,” said Linda Kelly, the group’s general counsel. “This is part of a deep-rooted, politically motivated campaign to undermine manufacturing in America, and we will continue our work to expose this coordinated effort.”</P><P>Representatives for BP, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.</P><P>New York Mayor Bill de Blasio also joined Scott Stringer, the comptroller, in announcing on Jan. 10 that the city’s five pension funds, which control about $189 billion in assets, intend to divest about $5 billion from more than 190 “fossil fuel reserve owners” within the next five years.</P><P>“It’s complex, it will take time, and there are going to be many steps, but we’re breaking new ground, and we are committed to forging a path forward while remaining laser-focused on our role as fiduciaries to the systems and beneficiaries we serve,” Stringer said.</P><P><EM>By Bob Van Voris</EM></P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The risk for shareholders is that some projects become loss-making as the demand for oil and gas ebbs.</P><P>Exxon Mobil Corp. and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> Plc have produced similar reports. Among other findings, Chevron said oil and gas will comprise 48 percent of the world’s energy mix by 2040, even under the International Energy Agency’s most unfavorable scenario for the industry. Now it’s 54 percent.</P><P>“Multiple scenarios” each throw up the same result: Demand for oil and gas will remain strong for decades, said  Mark Nelson, Chevron’s vice president for midstream, strategy and policy said in an interview.</P><P>The report, released on Thursday, “gives us confidence that we’re testing our business in a way that’s appropriate for our shareholders,given the context of many things that can change over time,” Nelson said.</P><P>The San Ramon, California-based company said it continually assesses the risks that environmental and <mark>carbon</mark>-pricing policies pose to its business model and has concluded there’s little threat at the present time.</P><P>World energy demand will grow strongly under all scenarios, Chevron said. The company sees the risk of it having so-called stranded assets, or uneconomic resources, as “very slim” due to the quality and diversity of its assets, Nelson said.</P><P>The report is published just a month after Mike Wirth succeeded John Watson as chief executive officer. It follows a study published a year ago that Amy Myers Jaffe, an academic at the Council of Foreign Relations, said lacked the detail provided by some other companies.</P><P>Investors Hermes EOS and Wespath Investment Management withdrew a proposal at Chevron’s annual meeting this year requesting an annual assessment of <mark>climate change</mark> impacts to give the company more time to come up with a fresh disclosure policy.</P><P>Chevron’s youngest director questioned the future of an industry the world’s third-largest oil explorer helps lead in a tweet earlier this week.</P><P>Dambisa Moyo, an economist and author who joined Chevron’s board in October 2016, on Wednesday tweeted, “If #oil energy consumption is declining and #renewableenergy consumption is on the #rise, what does that mean for the future of the oil industry?”</P><P>Nelson said the fact that a board-member was asking such a question shows Chevron’s commitment to challenging its own modeling. “Those types of scenarios need to be tested as we look at our investments going forward,” he said.</P><P>The tweet later disappeared from Moyo’s feed.</P><P><EM>To contact the reporter on this story: Kevin Crowley in Houston at kcrowley1@bloomberg.net.

Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid to protests of pipelines, disruptions of federal lease sales and environmental groups demanding that oil, natural gas and coal remain buried.</P><P>The problem with the grounder movement is the calamity that would likely unfold with a world left in the dark, Bruce Culpepper, president of Shell Oil Co., told an audience at the Energy Tax Conference sponsored by Bloomberg BNA and Mayer Brown.</P><P>In 2015, fossil fuels were responsible for generating 67% of U.S. electricity.</P><P>Solar and wind combined to generate 5.3% of the 4 trillion kilowatt hours and all renewables together contributed 7%, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).</P><P>Culpepper said Shell believes in addressing <mark>climate</mark> concerns, but he’s not up for the industry being painted as “a bunch of bad guys who just need to leave it in the ground.” Shell Oil Co. is the U.S. affiliate of <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> Plc (NYSE: <A href=""https://www.oilandgasinvestor.com/hart-energy-stock-details-761686?ticker=rds.a&amp;a=detailed"">RDS.A</A>) and employs about 20,000 people, mostly in the Houston and Gulf Coast area.</P><P>“If we were to do that, guess what, everybody that consumes energy, their prices would go up or they’re going to go without energy,” he said. “That impacts the people with the lowest incomes the hardest.”</P><P>And it would be impractical. For those committed to the idea of abandoning fossil fuels, Culpepper suggested finding a cozy spot for resettlement.</P><P>“I say we find a place where they can live and be comfortable when the lights go off because the sun doesn’t shine or the wind doesn’t blow,” he said.</P><P>Shell is actively addressing <mark>climate change</mark> and how to best respond. Part of the company’s reasoning behind February’s <A href=""https://www.oilandgasinvestor.com/even-more-global-shell-megamerger-offers-big-premium-bg-group-790121"">$70 billion purchase of BG Group Plc</A> was the allure of BG’s expansive LNG trading portfolio.</P><P>The acquisition of BG Group makes Shell the largest player in the LNG space. Shell is now more weighted to natural gas than oil and regards gas as a natural bridging fuel as the world struggles to manage growth while also curbing greenhouse emissions.</P><P>The company has already started to talk about itself not as just an oil and gas company, but as an energy company.</P><P>“I’d say we’re drifting more toward gas and drifting more toward a broader range of energy solutions over time,” Culpepper said.</P><H3>Plausible Dependability</H3><P>The future is a slippery thing, whether viewed through astrological charts, the grotesque characters on tarot cards or on the lines crisscrossing a palm.</P><P>Culpepper is no fortuneteller, he said.</P><P>But while Shell steers clear of making predictions, its scenario building is based on plausible assumptions of future world events. Or, as Culpepper describes it, “quantifiable, probable assumptions.”</P><P>Population, energy demand and emissions are variables it plays with to get a glimpse of what one possible future would resemble.</P><P>Population, for instance, will grow to somewhere around 9 billion by 2050, Culpepper said.</P><P>Because of the increased population, energy demand will likely double.</P><P>“Most of that population growth, most of that demand for increased energy is going to take place in what are currently developing or underdeveloped countries,” he said.</P><P>People in those countries will have the same hopes, dreams and aspirations for a lifestyle that is taken for granted in the U.S. and other developed nations.</P><P>To make those economies function, they will need energy.</P><P>“If you don’t have electricity, you don’t have running water. [If] you don’t have clean water, you’re really are not going to have a <mark>sustainable</mark>, developing economy,” Culpepper said.</P><P>Shell’s strategy encompasses power and progress with the idea that more energy needs to be produced with fewer emissions.</P><P>Those forces compete within Shell and other companies and will do so for the next several decades, Culpepper said. What’s clear is that doing nothing will not address <mark>climate change</mark> and switching to a renewable-only power plan isn’t feasible.</P><P>“You also can’t just leap over the so-called hydro<mark>carbon</mark> era and say we’re going to shut it all off and renewables will be the answer,” Culpepper said.</P><H3>A Chaotic Way</H3><P><mark>Climate change</mark> remains a polarizing and mostly political topic.</P><P>However, Culpepper said societal expectations appear to be changing to a point that people want to live on a planet that humanity isn’t destroying.</P><P>“Whether you believe in the science or not, there’s enough cause and effects that people are seeing to say … I’m kind of tired of being flooded and tired of the tornados and hurricanes and tired of the rising sea levels. I expect my government to deal with this,” he said.</P><P>Shell’s move into natural gas has been designed to meet those needs and enable electrification while also investing in areas such as <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage.</P><P>The current election cycle has many people jumping on a bandwagon that demands fossil fuel production cease—renewables will take care of the rest.</P><P>Culpepper said that ramping up renewables, particularly solar and wind, would only go so far.</P><P>The “intermittency problem” caused by lack of sunlight or wind may eventually be solved through <mark>innovation</mark>, such as batteries with greater storage capacity.</P><P>“The power generation sector when you look at it from a consumer point of view, only represents about 20% of the total energy consumed in the world,” he said. “So, yeah, you can continue to put renewables into that but you can’t overcome the need for something to overcome the gaps.”</P><P>That leaves now.</P><P>“At the moment there just isn’t a clear pathway to just forgetting fossil fuels,” he said. “There is something that needs to get done to reconcile those. We call it the energy transition.”</P><P>Natural gas is seen by Shell as one way forward. Because of coal-to-gas switching, the power sector has already met its pre-Paris Accords emission reduction targets.</P><P>However, the high intensity power needs of manufacturing, including production of steel, chemicals and cement require hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s because of the heat and fuel efficiency required.</P><P>Even with great technological strides, including more electric vehicles, five decades from now Shell research suggests power generation will shift.</P><P>“But in our modeling, fossil fuels will still represent 60% to 70% of the chunk of underlying energy even in the year 2050 or 2060,” he said, adding that’s if population and economic growth are more or less as forecasted.</P><P>“We’re not going to be out of the hub of the fossil fuel era any time soon,” he said.</P><P>Culpepper said that it is possible to grapple with the competition between growth and impact on <mark>climate</mark>, but only if the world sees unprecedented coordination, collaboration and <mark>innovation</mark> over the next several decades.</P><P>Simply having the U.S. go down the path alone won’t alter the outcome. The world has to be more aggressive in requiring other nations to live up to their promises through rigorous enforcement.</P><P>“It probably won’t play out that way. It is definitely plausible,” he said. “But it may also play out in a very chaotic way.”</P><P><EM>Darren Barbee can be reached at <A href=""mailto:dbarbee@hartenergy.com"">dbarbee@hartenergy.com</A>.</EM></P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Daniel Yergin, host of the event and vice chairman of IHS Markit, endlessly put the topic to CEOs and ministers from foreign petro-states.</P><P>It became increasingly clear that days of denial or even skepticism around <mark>climate change</mark> is now out of bounds for executives of publicly traded oil and gas companies. Instead, they backed <mark>carbon</mark> taxes as an efficient, market-based way to control <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions. They discussed increasing investments in wind and solar. They talked about unleashing the industry's innovative capacity to find technological solutions, such as <mark>carbon</mark> capture, to keep fossil fuels viable.</P><P>&quot;The low-<mark>carbon</mark> future will reshape the energy space,&quot; said Eldar Sætre, CEO of the Norwegian oil major Statoil. &quot;Some see this as a threat to our industry, but we should rather look for and act on the opportunities it offers.&quot;</P><DIV class=""asset_item asset-item fullwidth"" data-config-asset-position=""7""><DIV class=""hdnce-e hdnce-item-58449""><IFRAME src=""//interactives.ap.org/2015/<mark>climate</mark>-change/?SITE=%5Btxsae%5D"" class=""ap-embed"" width=""100%"" height=""900px"" style=""border: 1px solid #eee;"">

The overwhelming consensus among scientists, however, is that human activities - namely, the burning of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal - are accelerating global warming.</P><P><EM style=""font-weight: bold;"">No argument</EM></P><P>For many in the oil and gas industry, argument is no longer an option as governments around the world join that consensus. In late 2015, the leaders of nearly 200 countries pledged to dramatically lower <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by 2050 in a pact signed in Paris and known as the Paris agreement.</P><P>As nations tighten <mark>carbon</mark> policies, wind turbines and solar panels have become the fastest growing new source of electricity both in the U.S. and worldwide. That has spurred what amounts to an international arms race on low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy, with China, Europe and the United States battling for supremacy.</P><P>European oil giant <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> is predicting that by 2100, 80 percent of the world's electricity will come from renewables, up from less than 10 percent today.</P><P>&quot;Now that may sound a bit shocking to have an oil company, particularly a big player in the gas business, talk about that,&quot; said Jeff Edwards, general manager of global gas and LNG development for Shell Trading. &quot;But that's just the reality as we see it.&quot;</P><P>Not everyone at CERAWeek was convinced that the age of fossil fuels is coming to an end. Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources of Oklahoma Cirty and a Trump adviser on energy, said he believed the oil and gas industry was unfairly targeted by <mark>climate change</mark> rules during the Obama administration and suggested that Trump would follow through on his campaign pledge to leave the Paris agreement.</P><P>&quot;We have a unique president today,&quot; Hamm said Wednesday, &quot;unique in that he keeps his promises.&quot;</P><P>Other executives and industry leaders called for investing trillions of dollars in new oil and gas projects to meet a growing demand for energy as developing nations, such as India and China, expand their economies. Chevron CEO John Watson dismissed theories of fast-approaching peak oil demand as &quot;wishful thinking.&quot;</P><P>&quot;You still have literally billions of people entering the middle class,&quot; he said. &quot;It may turn over, but if you look at the forecasts, most of them still show growing liquids consumption for some time.&quot;</P><P>That is true to a certain extent. The International Energy Agency is projecting economic growth in India and China will continue to drive up global crude demand for the next two decades. But by 2040, all bets could be off as renewable energy and electric cars are expected to become ubiquitous features of world societies, analysts said.</P><P>Already, the sharp drop in the price of renewable energy is forcing nuclear and coal-fired power plants to shut down, and slowing the development of new natural gas plants.</P><P>&quot;The trend lines are clearly more wind and more solar and all of that will continue to push fossil off the supply curve,&quot; Barry Smitherman, a board member at NRG Energy and former chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission and Public Utilities Commission, said Thursday.</P><P><EM style=""font-weight: bold;"">Asking for proof</EM></P><P>Investors, meanwhile, are taking note. A growing coalition of pension funds and institutional investors is increasing pressure on oil and gas companies to offer proof of how they will adapt their businesses to prosper in a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy. Some European firms, including Statoil and the French oil major Total, have already committed to putting defined portions of their capital spending to energy sources that do not produce <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>While oil and gas executives might be staying on message, the possibility of a U.S. withdrawal from Paris is causing anxiety among proponents of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Dirk Forrister, president of the trade group International Emissions Trading Association, said he worried if Trump did pull out, some developing countries &quot;might think the pressure's off.&quot;</P><P>But with Europe and China showing no signs of backing away from their Paris commitments, the general belief is the trend toward more <mark>carbon</mark> regulation is not going away.</P><P>&quot;The administration will stir up the pot to some extent,&quot; said Dan Reicher, a law professor at Stanford University who served as an energy adviser to former President Barack Obama. &quot;But I think the basic direction is increasingly being set by forces outside the administration.&quot;</P><P> </P><P><EM style=""font-weight: bold;"">Jordan Blum contributed </EM><EM style=""font-weight: bold;"">to this report.</EM></P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

	Amsterdam, 23 May 2017 - Today, Filipinos demanding <mark>climate</mark> justice from the companies responsible for fossil fuels that have contributed the significant share of global emissions of industrial <mark>CO2</mark> and methane, (1) invited <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> plc (Shell) to the Philippines to cooperate with an investigation into the responsibility of investor-owned <mark>carbon</mark> producers for <mark>climate</mark>-related human rights harms. Shell, and its subsidiary in the Philippines, the Shell Company of the Philippines Limited, are attempting to stop the investigation. (2) 

</DIV></DIV><DIV><P>At Shell’s annual general meeting in The Hague, AG Saño, one of the Filipinos who petitioned the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines (CHR) to conduct the investigation, (3) hopes to address Shell CEO Ben van Beurden and ask him to attend all hearings and to present Shell’s plans for phasing out fossil fuels in order to prevent further human rights impacts resulting from <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>A prolific visual artist and activist known for his collaborative public murals that champion conservation, peace and human rights, AG Saño survived super-typhoon Haiyan (locally, “Yolanda”), which hit the Philippines in November 2013. His family initially feared he was among the casualties. AG helped carry bodies of those who lost their lives in the immediate aftermath. Today, he continues to use his art and his public messages to help him deal with his experiences and to raise awareness about <mark>climate change</mark>.  </P><P> AG Saño said, “Having escaped death myself, I get to live to tell the stories of those from one of the ground zeros of extreme weather events. These people risk losing everything - their families, their lives, and their way of life. People on the frontlines of <mark>climate change</mark> have everything to lose. What can Shell lose by showing up at the hearings?” Typhoon survivors, community and civil society organisations and notable individuals, petitioned the Commission for the investigation in 2015, two years after Haiyan, which claimed thousands of lives and affected millions of others who have yet to recover. (4) Their aim is to prevent further human rights harms resulting from <mark>climate change</mark> being endured by Filipinos.</P><P>“Shell should demonstrate real leadership on <mark>climate change</mark> and human rights. Companies say a lot of good things on paper about reducing emissions and respecting human rights”, said Desiree Llanos Dee, <mark>Climate</mark> Justice and Liability campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia in the Philippines. “If they really mean it, they will show up and take part in the national public inquiry when hearings begin.”  Twenty-one companies have so far engaged to some degree with the Petition lodged before the Commission, including: Shell Company of the Philippines, Ltd. and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> plc. (5) Some have shared responses with the NGO Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC). (6) Only one company, Rio Tinto, seems to properly acknowledged the ‘fact-finding’ nature of the investigation. (7) Despite knowing about the severe risks posed by <mark>climate change</mark> for decades, the fossil fuel industry continues to extract and sell oil, coal and gas, which, when used as directed, result in significant amounts of <mark>climate change</mark>-causing greenhouse gas emissions. (8) In 1991, a film produced by Shell showed that the oil giant has long known about the catastrophic risks of <mark>climate change</mark>. (9)</P><P>The national inquiry is one of the many people-powered legal actions related to <mark>climate change</mark> that has been initiated around the globe by Indigenous Peoples in Canada, seniors in Switzerland, farmers from Peru and Pakistan, youth in Norway, Pakistan, Uganda, and the United States, and citizens in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Sweden. (10) In each of these cases, people are using the power of the law, because governments and fossil fuel companies are failing to protect and to respect human rights. <EM>–ENDS-</EM></P><P><STRONG>Notes for Editors:</STRONG></P><P>1)     Heede, R. 2014. <mark>Carbon</mark> Majors: Accounting for <mark>Carbon</mark> and Methane Emissions 1854-2010, Methods and Results Report, April 7, 2014.

CEO Ben van Beurden addressed the challenges of switching to renewable energy sources while maintaining the current business model and satisfying investor demands for consistent dividend payouts: “If collectively we find a way to stay within the 2 degree (Celsius limit), we will still need significant investment in oil and gas…I am talking about up to a trillion dollars every year.”  Based upon this, it seems that renewable energy and CCS solutions will remain a minor portion of the business, pending future investor interest or changes in financial incentives.</P><P>In May 2016, Shell organized its renewable energy investments into a separate business unit, titled ‘New Energies,’ receiving an annual investment budget of $200 M.  This business unit covers investments in biofuel, hydrogen fuel, wind and solar energy.  Its CCS joint venture, Quest, received C$865 M from the Canadian government and started operations in Alberta in 2015.  Since start-up, Quest has reduced <mark>CO2</mark> emissions by 315 kilotonnes.  Shell has the potential to continue innovating in CCS technology as well as renewable energies, but has clearly demonstrated a lack of willingness to scale up these efforts unless investors are able to forego payouts, or financial incentives in the sustainability space improve.  This bodes poorly for Shell’s long-term dominance in the energy space, as their own energy scenarios have forecasted.</P><P>Word count: 731 words</P><P><mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> plc. 2015 Annual Report.

Shell already is the world's leader in liquefied natural gas.</P><P>&quot;There's no other issue with the potential to disrupt our industry on such a deep and fundamental level,&quot; van Beurden said of <mark>climate change</mark> and the need to help meet the Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord goals, even though the United States plans to split from the agreement under the Trump administration.</P><P>The emphasis goes beyond making Shell's own operations cleaner and more efficient because most of the emissions come from Shell's products after they are sold. So Shell intends to invest more in offshore wind farms, biofuels, <mark>carbon</mark> capture projects and the planting of trees and forests.</P><P><A href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/For-big-oil-<mark>climate</mark>-change-looms-large-even-in-10993607.php"">RELATED: For big oil, <mark>climate change</mark> looms large even in Trump era</A></P><P>Shell is rolling out a new program in Europe to charge about 1 or 2 cents more for gasoline to fund tree-planting projects worldwide.</P><P>&quot;Oil and gas will continue to be the core for Shell for many decades to come,&quot; van Beurden said. But they must become cleaner. &quot;We are businesses; we're not charities.&quot;</P><P>As such, Shell is planning to grow more in U.S. shale in West Texas' Permian Basin, as well as in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico on both the U.S. and Mexican sides of the Gulf.</P><P>With a growing focus on natural gas, van Beurden said Shell and other players must continue to work to reduce and eliminate methane leaks and emissions or risk having natural gas' role &quot;fatally undermined.&quot;</P><P>Last year, van Beurden said global oil demand could peak as soon as the late 2020s. He didn't back away from that Wednesday, but he said that is just one possible scenario. Oil demand could instead peak in the 2030s or even later, he said.</P><P>&quot;We ignore that at our peril.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></BODY></HTML>"

(Craig Ruttle/AP)</DIV></DIV><P data-elm-loc=""1"">The New York City government is suing the world’s five largest publicly traded oil companies, seeking to hold them responsible for present and future damage to the city from <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P data-elm-loc=""2"">The suit, filed Tuesday against BP, Chevron, Conoco-Phillips, ExxonMobil and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark>, claims the companies together produced 11 percent of all of global-warming gases through the oil and gas products they have sold over the years. It also charges that the companies and the industry they are part of have known for some time about the consequences but sought to obscure them.</P><P data-elm-loc=""3"">“In this litigation, the City seeks to shift the costs of protecting the City from <mark>climate change</mark> impacts back onto the companies that have done nearly all they could to create this existential threat,” reads the lawsuit, brought by New York corporation counsel Zachary Carter and filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.</P><P data-elm-loc=""4"">The legal strategy has already been embraced by several California cities and counties, but prior lawsuits seeking to blame companies for their role in causing <mark>climate change</mark> have foundered.</P><P data-elm-loc=""5"">It remains unclear whether a new wave of litigation — propelled by stronger <mark>climate</mark> science, reports about how much some companies knew about <mark>climate change</mark> decades ago, and somewhat divergent legal strategies — will succeed where those efforts failed.</P><P data-elm-loc=""6"">In California last year, Marin County, San Mateo County and the city of Imperial Beach similarly <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/07/20/this-could-be-the-next-big-strategy-for-suing-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">sued</A> a group of fossil fuel companies over damage related to <mark>climate change</mark> — citing a theory called “public nuisance,” which basically argues that companies are causing an injury to the localities under common law. The cities of San Francisco and Oakland and the city and county of Santa Cruz have also filed suit.</P><P data-elm-loc=""7"">“I think the significant development here is that this is the first of these cases in this last year that’s filed outside of California,” said Michael Burger, who directs the Sabin Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Law at Columbia University. If more and more localities sue, “we might be able to see adequate pressure applied to these companies to inspire action on <mark>climate change</mark>,” he said.</P><P data-elm-loc=""8"">So far, that has not been the response. ExxonMobil has instead <A href=""http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/09/investing/exxon-<mark>climate</mark>-change-california-san-francisco-oakland/index.html"" target=""_blank"">reacted strongly</A> to the claims, <A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4345487-Exxon-Texas-Petition-Jan-2018.html"" target=""_blank"">seeking in Texas court</A> to depose California state officials and others involved in bringing the cases for “potential claims of abuse of process, civil conspiracy, and violation of ExxonMobil’s civil rights.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""9""><mark>Climate change</mark> “is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-<mark>carbon</mark> choices for businesses and consumers,” Curtis Smith, head of U.S. media relations for Shell, wrote by email, “not by the courts.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""10"">BP and ConocoPhillips, two other defendants named in the lawsuit, declined to comment.</P><P data-elm-loc=""11"">Exxon <A href=""https://energyfactor.exxonmobil.com/perspectives/better-approach-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" target=""_blank"">responded</A> to New York’s lawsuit on its blog, where the firm has also challenged investigative reports from Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News and the Los Angeles Times that showed the company was an early pioneer in <mark>climate</mark>-change science in the 1980s, reports that were cited in the suit.</P><P data-elm-loc=""12"">“ExxonMobil welcomes any well-meaning and good faith attempt to address the risks of <mark>climate change</mark>,” wrote Suzanne McCarron, Exxon’s vice president of public and government affairs. “Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions. Lawsuits of this kind — filed by trial attorneys against an industry that provides products we all rely upon to power the economy and enable our domestic life — simply do not do that.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""13"">Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall said in an email: “This lawsuit is factually and legally meritless, and will do nothing to address the serious issue of <mark>climate change</mark>. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue that requires global engagement. Should this litigation proceed, it will only serve special interests at the expense of broader policy, regulatory and economic priorities.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""14"" class=""interstitial-link ""><I>[<A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/01/10/beaches-line-the-coast-like-pearls-other-states-ask-why-floridas-are-more-special"">Beaches line the coast like pearls.

And what a horrible, disgusting way to profit — the way it puts so many people’s lives in danger.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""23"">“It’s time that they are held accountable,” de Blasio said. “It’s time that things change in the way we do business.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""24"" class=""interstitial-link ""><I>[<A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/01/08/hurricanes-wildfires-made-2017-the-most-costly-u-s-disaster-year-on-record"">Extreme hurricanes and wildfires made 2017 the most costly U.S. disaster year on record</A>]</I></P><P data-elm-loc=""25"">In addition to the litigation, officials said they expect to divest up to $5 billion in investments from as many as 190 companies with fossil fuel ties, even as they promised to maintain their fiduciary duty to New York’s pensioners.</P><P data-elm-loc=""26"">“We’re using this moment to send a message to the world,” said New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer. “We believe a green economy is a thriving economy.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""27"">Bill McKibben, an author and co-founder of the <mark>climate</mark> advocacy group 350.org, praised the city’s actions Wednesday.</P><P data-elm-loc=""28"">“I’ve been watching the <mark>climate</mark> fight for the last 30 years,” McKibben told reporters. “This is one of the handful of most important moments in that 30-year fight.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""29"">But the oil and gas lobby said that by not investing in their industry, New York was doing city workers a disservice.</P><P data-elm-loc=""30"">“Today Mayor de Blasio turned his back on millions of first responders, police officers and public employees who depend on their pensions to provide for themselves and their families in retirement,” said Karen Moreau, New York executive director for the American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. oil and gas lobbying group. “Government pension managers have a responsibility by law to seek the greatest return for their investors and pensions that invest in oil and natural gas companies have historically delivered a stronger return than other investments.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""31""><EM>Brady Dennis contributed to this report.</EM></P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""moat-trackable pb-f-theme-normal pb-f-dehydrate-false pb-f-async-false full pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-article-article-author-bio"" moat-id=""article/article-author-bio"" data-chain-name=""no-name"" data-feature-name=""no-name"" data-feature-id=""article/article-author-bio"" data-pb-fingerprint=""0f7Y1cjOKqD"" id=""f01xAHTANtmHPq""><DIV class=""pb-bottom-author-wrapper border-bottom-hairline border-bottom-100-pct""><DIV class=""pb-bottom-author ""><DIV class=""pb-author-info ""><DIV class=""pb-author-bio"">Chris Mooney covers <mark>climate change</mark>, energy, and the environment.

But it was welcomed by those who knew that Van Beurden was no fluffy liberal. “<A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f9517af6-b986-11e3-957a-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2Ff9517af6-b986-11e3-957a-00144feabdc0.html%3Fsiteedition%3Duk&amp;siteedition=uk&amp;_i_referer=#axzz3ZA4W9Irm"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Follow the money</A>,” was his mantra during a stint at Shell’s chemicals division, according to one colleague. Now, his message to the industry was: follow the overwhelming evidence on greenhouse gas emissions and join the debate on <mark>climate change</mark>, or risk the fossil fuel industry being sidelined.</P><P>But Shell’s own business model, and in particular a <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/08/shell-bg-group-47bn-takeover-oil-industry"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">career-defining takeover</A> executed by Van Beurden within two months of that industry broadside, points to a different corporate philosophy. The powerful ranks of oil and gas industry executives had not witnessed a Damascene moment.

Referring to the internationally agreed limit on a global temperature rise of 2C, the document states: “Both our scenarios and the IEA (International Energy Agency) New Policies scenario (and our base case energy demand and outlook) do not limit emissions to be consistent with the back-calculated 450 parts per million (<mark>CO2</mark> in the atmosphere) 2C.

Desertification of parts of the globe would force agriculture on to untouched areas of the planet, while populations would have to adapt to rising sea levels, extreme weather and increasing levels of agricultural pests and diseases, according to a collection of papers published by the Royal Society in 2010.</P><P>Meanwhile, a recent, seismic corporate event put even greater distance between Van Beurden’s words and reality. On 8 April Shell’s chief executive shocked the industry by announcing the <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/08/shell-bg-group-47bn-takeover-oil-industry"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">acquisition of BG Group</A>, the former exploration arm of British Gas, now one of the world’s biggest gas producers. Having warned industry colleagues about the discredited trade-off between jobs and the environment, Van Beurden put growth first in emphatic fashion. The BG deal is the biggest takeover in the company’s history and it clearly propels Shell deeper into fossil fuel extraction.</P><P>Putting the two businesses together makes a growing <mark>carbon</mark> footprint even bigger. <A href=""http://reports.shell.com/sustainability-report/2014/our-performance/environment/air-emissions.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Shell’s direct greenhouse gas emissions from facilities</A> were 76m tonnes on a <mark>CO2</mark>-equivalent basis in 2014, up 4% from 73m tonnes 12 months earlier. Operations directly under BG’s control in 2014 <A href=""http://www.bg-group.com/612/sustainability/2014-sustainability-report/valuing-our-environment-and-<mark>climate</mark>/<mark>climate</mark>-change:-our-operations/#/612/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">emitted 7.6m tonnes of greenhouse gases</A>, an increase of about 600,000 tonnes, or 9%, on 2013. If regulators let the new partnership proceed, Shell will be increasing its oil and gas reserves by 25%, raising production by 20% and employing almost 100,000 staff. This would be a big boost given that Shell, which in its early incarnation nearly a century ago boasted of producing 11% of the world’s oil, has struggled to find its own oil and gas reserves through the drill bit. Fadel Gheit, the highly respectedindustry analyst, described the transaction as “one of the best deals the industry has ever seen”.</P><P>But <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/08/shell-takeover-of-bg-what-the-analysts-say"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Pascal Menges, manager of the Lombard Odier Global Energy Fund</A>, which invests in the energy sector, sees failure as the driving motive behind the deal. “This shows that big oil’s growth strategy over the last 10 years is bust,” he argued. “Having bet enormous sums on eye-wateringly expensive oil production from oil sands, ultra-deep water and Arctic fields, the super majors are now ill-placed to cope with a low oil price,” he said, although oil had recently recovered from a perilous low of less than $50 per barrel this year – a price which makes profitable oil and gas exploration very difficult – to around $65.</P><FIGURE itemprop=""associatedMedia image"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/ImageObject"" data-component=""image"" class=""element element-image img--landscape element--supporting  fig--narrow-caption fig--has-shares "" data-media-id=""a43fd685bfc228e4ca20e8d2368d2065341863ea"" id=""img-3""><DIV class=""block-share block-share--article  hide-on-mobile "" data-link-name=""block share""><A class=""rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link"" href=""http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=The%20real%20story%20behind%20Shell%27s%20<mark>climate</mark>%20change%20rhetoric&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2F2015%2Fmay%2F17%2Fshell-<mark>climate</mark>-change-rhetoric-the-real-story%3Fpage%3Dwith%3Aimg-3%23img-3&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F15%2F1431703950417%2Fb599a5b9-92c0-4cd2-9ba6-37defe05c560-2060x1236.jpeg"" target=""_blank"" data-link-name=""social pinterest""><SPAN class=""u-h"">Pinterest</SPAN></A></DIV><FIGCAPTION class=""caption caption--img caption caption--img"" itemprop=""description""> Ben van Beurden, left, shakes hands with Andrew Gould, chairman of BG Group Plc, after Shell agreed to buy BG Group.

</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Menges also highlighted a trend pushing Shell into exploring difficult parts of the world – such as the Canadian tar sands, Nigeria, and deep water off Brazil and the US Gulf (underlined by the US government’s controversial decision on 11 May to allow <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/11/shell-arctic-drilling-alaska-oil-gas"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Shell to restart drilling in the Arctic,</A> off the coast of Alaska).</P><P>Shell has either taken most accessible oil and gas fields or had its path blocked by states engaged in resource nationalism – governments giving licences to state-owned companies at the expense of foreign multinationals.</P><P>Shell is upfront that its takeover of BG is about profit and capability.</P><P>A spokeswoman said: “By combining BG’s portfolio and skills set with Shell’s capabilities we can deliver a step change in the growth priorities for both of our companies. This means more deep water and more LNG [liquefied natural gas] plays where we have strong profitability and capabilities.”</P><P>This retreat to some of the most inaccessible and technically challenging oil and gas fields in the world poses, however, a further threat to Shell: the possibility of these projects being forcibly mothballed if there is global action to head off a rise of more than 2C.</P><P><A href=""http://www.<mark>carbon</mark>tracker.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CTI-Oil-Report-Oil-May-2014-13-05.pdf"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Research from <mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker</A>, a <mark>climate change</mark> thinktank, highlights all these areas – the Canadian tar sands, the US Gulf and Alaska – as being at the highest risk from enforced mothballing and becoming “stranded assets” tying up billions of pounds worth of shareholder funds.</P><P>This analysis was given further weight by a study for the Norwegian government by the industry consultancy Rystad Energy. <A href=""http://www.rystadenergy.com/AboutUs/NewsCenter/PressReleases/<mark>climate</mark>-report-for-ministry-of-the-environment"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">It concluded</A> that even if the world managed to remain within the 2C limit the “largest stranded areas are offshore North and South America, west Africa and in the Arctic”.</P><FIGURE class=""element element-interactive interactive element--supporting"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2015/03/<mark>climate</mark>-embeds/campaign-form/update/promos/campaign-embed-form.html"" data-alt=""<mark>Climate</mark> campaign sign up""><A href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2015/03/<mark>climate</mark>-embeds/campaign-form/update/promos/campaign-embed-form.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""><mark>Climate</mark> campaign sign up</A></FIGURE><P>The BG Group deal gives Shell a significant stake in one of the most technically challenging – not to mention potentially stranded – deep water projects in the world. In the previous decade Brazil made a mammoth oil discovery off its Atlantic coast and Shell inherited BG’s investments in those fields. The fields off Brazil are at depths of 2,100 metres (7,000 ft) compared with the 1,500 metres that BP was operating in when its Deepwater Horizon rig blew up in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 during a drilling operation. Deep water is expensive to operate in and, as BP found out, an environment where the consequences of serious accidents are harder to manage.</P><P>But Van Beurden rejects the stranded asset argument for Shell. In <A href=""http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/media/speeches-and-articles/2014/working-together-lower-<mark>carbon</mark>-higher-energy.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">a speech</A> to Columbia University, in New York, last September, he said: “In our opinion, the ‘stranded assets’ thesis underestimates the significance of rising energy demand. It underplays the role natural gas will perform in the global energy system, especially in replacing coal power plants. And it ignores the potential of <mark>innovation</mark>s like <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage.”</P><P>With Shell’s involvement in such controversial areas there is also scrutiny of its lobbying efforts. The Union of Concerned Scientists in the US has started a campaign against Shell over its continued involvement in the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), a rightwing nonprofit organisation that has been criticised for drafting model legislation that denies any human contribution to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>While companies such as Occidental Petroleum and Google have left Alec – Google’s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, alleged last year “<A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/23/google-to-cut-ties-with-rightwing-lobby-group-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change-lies"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">they’re just literally lying</A>” about <mark>climate change</mark> – Shell argues that it supports the organisation because it promotes job creation and the free market.</P><P>In a statement, it said: “We are members of Alec and several other similar groups across the political spectrum that foster bipartisan exchanges between elected officials. In terms of Alec, we specifically support their pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda and generally find commonality on issues important to the oil and gas industry.</P><P>“While there are some issues on which we have different views, we look at the totality of the organisation not a single issue. This is the case with other organisations as well.”</P><P>Some critics say the “responsible image” of Shell moving into a cleaner gas sector via the BG deal masks a fossil fuel company struggling for survival in a world facing <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“This is not an evil guy leading the world to destruction. He is just leading a company that is trying to find a way of maintaining this [fossil fuels] system,” said Ike Teuling, energy campaigner with Friends of the Earth Netherlands.</P><P>Fittingly for a pragmatic Dutchman, There is considerable latitude in Van Beurden’s stance on <mark>climate change</mark>. He argues that global warming is a significant issue that needs tackling but not in a way that distracts attention away from the reality of growing population, increasing prosperity and growing energy demand.</P><P>“Today, three billion people still lack access to the modern energy many of us take for granted,” he said. “This isn’t just about having a dustbuster or a TV set. <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Energy</A> access often makes the difference between poverty and prosperity. At the same time, demand is growing. There will be more people on this planet, more people living in cities and more people rising from poverty. They will all need energy if they are to thrive. The issue is how to balance one moral obligation, energy access for all, against the other: fighting <mark>climate change</mark>.”.</P><P>This allows Van Beurden to indicate that fossil fuel critics are largely based in the largely prosperous west and are denying prosperity to those developing countries such as China and India who need oil and gas energy to become more prosperous themselves.</P><P>Included in Van Beurden’s industry speech in that hotel ballroom there were excerpts that endorsed the status quo. “Yes, <mark>climate change</mark> is real. And yes, renewables are an indispensable part of the future energy mix. But no, provoking a sudden death of fossil fuels isn’t a plausible plan,” he suggested.</P><P>Nothing in Shell’s current strategy suggests Van Beurden is going to present a plausible alternative.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Report highlights include:</P><UL><LI>A thorough review of <mark>climate</mark> science literature, including acknowledgement of fossil fuels’ dominant role in driving greenhouse gas emissions. More importantly, Shell quantifies its own products’ contribution to global <mark>CO2</mark> emissions.</LI><LI>A detailed analysis of potential <mark>climate</mark> impacts, including rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and human migration.</LI><LI>A discussion of the potential impacts to the fossil fuel sector itself, including legislation, changing public sentiment, and infrastructure vulnerabilities. Shell concludes that active engagement from the energy sector is desirable.</LI><LI>A cautious response to uncertainty in scientific models, pressing for sincere consideration of solutions even in the face of existing debates.</LI><LI>A warning to take policy action early, even before major changes are observed to the <mark>climate</mark>.</LI></UL><P>In short, by 1988 Shell was not only aware of the potential threats posed by <mark>climate change</mark>, it was open about its own role in creating the conditions for a warming world. Similar documents by ExxonMobil, oil trade associations, and utility companies have emerged in recent years, though this Shell document is a rare, early, and concrete accounting of <mark>climate</mark> responsibility by an oil major.</P><P><STRONG>Fossil fuels are driving <mark>CO2</mark> emissions</STRONG></P><P>Throughout the report, Shell acknowledges the central role of fossil fuels, and oil in particular, in increasing <mark>CO2</mark> emissions. While the authors note the uncertainties and limitations of contemporary <mark>climate</mark> models — particularly around the timing and intensity of impacts — there is little ambiguity about the responsibility of the oil industry. The report states, “Although <mark>CO2</mark> is emitted to the atmosphere through several natural processes… the main cause of increasing <mark>CO2</mark> concentrations is considered to be fossil fuel burning.”</P><P>Later, the authors quantify Shell’s products’ unique contribution to global <mark>CO2</mark> emissions by segment. According to this internal analysis, Shell’s products (oil, gas, and coal) were responsible for 4% of total global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions in 1984. This is one of the earliest examples of <mark>carbon</mark> accounting by an oil major, and consistent with Richard Heede’s “<A href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-pvpXB8rp67dmhmsueWaUczHS5XyPy4p/view?usp=sharing""><mark>Carbon</mark> Majors</A>” methodology of tracing <mark>carbon</mark> responsibility back to the producers.</P><P><STRONG><mark>Climate change</mark> could have costly and significant impacts</STRONG></P><P>The report states that <mark>climate</mark> impacts could include “significant changes in sea level, ocean currents, precipitation patterns, regional temperature and weather.” It also states changes would impact “the human environment, future living standards and food supplies, and could have major social, economic and political consequences.”</P><P>Shell’s authors detail additional, specific impacts including the abandonment of cities and countries in low-lying areas (e.g. Bangladesh) and coral reef destruction, concluding these environmental and socio-economic changes may be the “greatest in human history.”</P><P>Shell’s analysis draws on much of the best available scientific research of the time, detailed in a lengthy appendix. The authors also include details of a report Shell commissioned from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at University of East Anglia in 1981. The research was later extended for Department of Energy and published by the U.S. government in 1984. Shell’s relationship with CRU and Director Wigley continued until at least 1985.</P><P><STRONG>Fossil fuel companies will be directly impacted</STRONG></P><P>No surprise, Shell examines the physical, financial, and political impacts of a warming world to its own business. It notes the risk of legislation and “changing demand for our products,” as well as new business opportunities in alternative fuels. Shell also anticipates the “environmental problem” forcing a policy response, the need for international government action, and the reputational risk of “political anxiety.” It’s up to investors to assess if these and other risks were adequately disclosed in subsequent years.</P><P>In light of these “strong stakes,” the authors advise active engagement from the energy sector in discussions of policy and programs.</P><P><STRONG>Uncertainty is not cause for delay</STRONG></P><P>Shell notes the existing uncertainty in <mark>climate</mark> models, recognizing that while some impacts are unavoidable, the relative timing, severity, and geographic distribution of global warming requires further research and observation. Nonetheless, Shell does not advocate delaying robust consideration of possible solutions until impacts are observed. In Shell’s own words:</P><P>“With very long time scales involved, it would be tempting for society to wait until then to begin doing anything. The potential implications for the world are, however, so large, that policy options need to be considered much earlier. And the energy industry needs to consider how it should play its part.”</P><P>Interested in more Shell documents?

And similar efforts to go after large industries for alleged damage to the public, including cases against makers of lead paint and tobacco products, have seen mixed results in the courts.</P><P>Product-liability and public-health experts said the new <mark>climate</mark>-change cases are extremely ambitious in scope, having the potential to set wide-ranging precedent concerning financial liability for forecasted impacts of global warming.</P><P>Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they modeled their legal tactics after past efforts to hold accountable cigarette businesses, makers of cancer-causing agents and gas and chemical companies that used methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), a gasoline additive that has contaminated groundwater across the country.</P><P>While many industries have won in court and avoided costly payouts, those high-profile cases have brought negative publicity for various companies or even helped change overall public sentiment about a highlighted issue.</P><P>If Imperial Beach and the two counties prevail, household names such as <A href=""http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/topic/business/energy-resource-industries/chevron-corportion-ORCRP003149-topic.html"" title=""Chevron Corportion"">Chevron</A>, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, BP and <A id=""ORCRP013311"" title=""<mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> Plc"" href=""/topic/business/energy-resource-industries/gasoline-industry/royal-dutch-shell-plc-ORCRP013311-topic.html""><mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark></A> could be liable for billions of dollars in mitigation costs and punitive damages in coming decades.</P><P>The leading industry groups for oil and coal conglomerates — the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Oil &amp; Gas Association — declined to comment for this story.</P><P>A decisive victory for the plaintiffs could trigger an avalanche of similar lawsuits nationwide. Other local governments could feel emboldened to sue fuel companies for a host of expenses related to global warming, including flood and storm damage, drought-related wildfires and steep increases in air-conditioning bills.</P><P>“How to deal with sea-level rise and, in particular, how to pay for it has been a growing concern for communities,” said Victor Sher, an attorney with Sher Edling LLP, a law firm that specializes in environmental cases and is representing Imperial Beach and Marin and San Mateo counties. “There’s nothing that makes this unique to California. I would not be surprised if there are other communities that are interested in this approach.”</P><P>The law firm is working on contingency. Neither the local governments involved in the <mark>climate change</mark> cases nor the law group would say who came up with the legal strategy or which group initiated the collaboration.</P><P>“We cannot discuss communications between the county and Sher Edling, including pre-litigation conversations,” said Paul Okada, chief deputy county counsel for San Mateo County. “The county and its board of supervisors have been working on sea level rise issues for years. Our office has also known and worked with Matt Edling, a county resident, for nearly a decade.”</P><P>The three new lawsuits are largely based on public nuisance law, meaning the local governments have to prove that fossil-fuel companies have caused special harm to their residents — in this case, costs associated with adapting to sea-level rise. The plaintiffs are also seeking punitive damages.</P><P>The most compelling precedent is perhaps a public nuisance lawsuit by 10 California cities and counties against several manufacturers of lead paint.</P><P>In 2014, a Santa Clara Superior Court judge order three companies — ConAgra Grocery Products, NL Industries and Sherwin-Williams — to pay a collective $1.15 billion into a fund to clean up old homes that suffered exposure to lead paint. The case was appealed and has been in the courts for 17 years now.</P><P>A similar effort involving more than half a dozen cities along the West Coast has <A href=""http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/environment/sdut-monsanto-pcbs-san-diego-bay-cleanup-gomez-lawyers-2015dec11-story.html"" target=""_blank"">taken Monsanto to court</A> to help pay for the costs of cleaning up polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, a global contaminant linked to cancer, neurological damage, thyroid problems and reproductive complications.</P><P>Such cases are largely predicated on the idea that corporations knew about the harms of their products but still sold them to continue making profits.</P><P>At the heart of the new litigation is a similar narrative that has to a certain extent been bolstered by scientific research as well as recent investigative reporting: Plaintiffs allege that executives of large oil and coal companies knew going back decades that their fossil fuels would warm up the planet — and possibly concealed that evidence. They sold their merchandise anyway and as a result, communities are today bracing for the worst consequences of chronic flooding driven by rising tides from melting glaciers, the plaintiffs said in their lawsuits.</P><P>“The notion is you have large corporations with highly developed research-and-development capacities and actual knowledge, frequently by the scientists within the organizations,” said Sher at the law firm. “They advise management and then management decides to ignore what they’re saying.”</P><P><A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken"" target=""_blank"">Reporting</A> by the nonprofit journalism group Inside <mark>Climate</mark> News and the Los Angeles Times <A href=""http://graphics.latimes.com/exxon-arctic/"" target=""_blank"">found that ExxonMobil</A> and other industry players conducted internal research going back to the 1980s that found ties between fossil fuels and <mark>climate change</mark>.</P></DIV><DIV class=""trb_ar_page"" data-role=""pagination_page"" data-content-page=""2""><P>At the same time, the state attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts have been investigating whether ExxonMobil improperly concealed this knowledge. The company has sued to block those inquiries, and that case is being heard in federal court.</P><P>Depending on how far the cases get, the world could learn substantially more about what oil and coal businesses knew and when.</P><P>To get the ball rolling, plaintiffs will have to prove that these corporations were a substantial factor in the alleged harms. This process could be trickier than it sounds, as the defendants may argue that complicity in <mark>climate change</mark> is shared globally by other large industries as well as anyone who drives a gas-powered vehicle or flies in an airplane or flips on the lights.</P><P>“The defendants can say, ‘Look, we may have emitted a bunch of (<mark>carbon</mark> dioxide), but if the only <mark>CO2</mark> in the world were ours, there’d be no global <mark>climate change</mark>, so we’re not a substantial factor,’” said Greg Keating, a professor with the University of Southern California’s Gould School of Law, who has written about <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Lawyers for Imperial Beach and Marin and San Mateo counties said they’ve gone to significant lengths to quantify the greenhouse gases they said are attributable to the fossil fuel companies in question. It could eventually be up to a jury to decide how compelling those figures are, but the quantification strategy is a key part of efforts to get judges to take the lawsuit seriously.</P><P>Specifically, they calculate that the defendants are collectively responsible for more than 20 percent of all <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and methane emitted between 1965 and 2015. This is a period in time referred to by scientists as the “great acceleration” when a fossil fuel production ramped up, accounting for roughly 75 percent of all historic emission from industry.</P><P>Because of recent advances in science, lawyers for the plaintiffs believe they can draw a convincing line from industry activities to seaside communities.</P><P>There are a whole host of other highly technical legal arguments that could hamstring the case before it even gets started. But if it clears a few key initial hurdles, the lawsuits could fundamentally restructure the way the country looks at corporate liability.</P><ASIDE class=""trb_em trb_embed "" data-content-embedlocation=""Embed + (4)"" data-content-id=""91593066"" data-content-size=""large"" data-content-type=""video"" data-content-slug=""sd-me-v-must-see-headlines"" data-content-subtype=""premiumvideo"" data-role=""sc_item  mediamanager_container  imgsize_ratiosizecontainer lightbox_container  "" data-state="""" data-embed-id=""91593066""><DIV class=""trb_em_m""><DIV class=""trb_em_r"" data-role=""lightbox_metadata""><DIV class=""trb_em_r_ca""><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It will go public with the idea in June, according to <EM><A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/15/shell-creates-green-energy-division-to-invest-in-wind-power"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Guardian</A>. </EM></P><P>It’s unlikely to attach much fanfare to the event, conscious of the risks of making exaggerated claims about saving the planet. The operations will account for only $1.7 billion in invested capital and have an annual investment budget of only $200 million out of a capital expenditure budget of $33 billion this year.</P><P> </P><P>But <mark>climate</mark> campaigners say it’s the thinking behind the move that’s more important; thinking that’s outlined in a new supplement to the company’s long-term energy outlook, entitled <EM><A href=""http://www.shell.com/energy-and-<mark>innovation</mark>/the-energy-future/scenarios/a-better-life-with-a-healthy-planet/_jcr_content/par/textimage_537406589.file/1462543150809/bce5cb0750a7797d79d7d43d3021596f/a-better-life-with-a-healthy-planet.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A Better Life with a Healthy Planet</A>. </EM></P><P>In most of its previous long-term research, Shell had refused to consider the possibility that there would be effective policy action to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius. It has leaned on MIT research suggesting that average temperatures will rise between 2.4 and 2.7 degrees by the end of the century. But the new report suggests that keeping the rise in temperatures to the 2 degrees pledged in the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement in December may be possible—albeit only in a scenario that “will require the combination of all the most optimistic outcomes described in (the MIT’s research) and more.”</P><P>“Our work has led us to conclude that providing the necessary energy in the context of net-zero <mark>CO2</mark> emissions”—i.e. a world in which the energy sector adds no further <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide to the atmosphere<EM>—”</EM>is technically feasible. But it will be very challenging,” Shell’s VP for global business environment, Jeremy Bentham wrote.</P><P>The main thrust of Shell’s environmental shtick in the past has been to urge governments to substitute more natural gas for coal in the electricity fuel mix. Its merger with BG Group fortified an already strong position in the world market for liquefied natural gas in particular. By contrast, it has shunned developing offshore wind in Europe or backing solar power (except in cases where the power generated goes to improve the efficiency of its oil lifting).</P><P>Why is this change of emphasis important? Because action to limit global warming is almost invariably action to stop Shell from monetizing its reserves of oil and gas, and therefore action to force it to write down the value of its asset base. That’s a challenge facing all oil and gas companies, and Shell is arguably further along that road than, say, ExxonMobil <A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""xom"">(xom)</A>, in as much as it has accepted shareholder resolutions asking it to detail the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> to its future value. By contrast Exxon is under investigation in New York and California for what amounts to the opposite: misleading investors about the risk of <mark>climate change</mark>. It denies the allegations.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""bottom-recirc padded-mobile "" data-tracking-zone=""bottom-recirc""><DIV class=""component lead-gen clearfix bottom-recirc"" data-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-mobile-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-partial=""sponsored-tile"" data-variation=""bottom-recirc"" data-title=""SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT"" data-provider=""dianomi"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-bottom-recirc"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-right-rail"" data-logo=""http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png"" data-logo_url=""https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&amp;utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank"" data-native_ad=""%7B%22dimensions%22%3A%22482x100%22%2C%22placement%22%3A%22footer%22%2C%22priority%22%3A6%7D"" data-nativekey=""wAcSQW5rUVzGCkuf6AZTLmdV""><DIV class=""title-wrapper""><H3 class=""subtitle"">SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

      </A></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden""><DIV class=""field-items""><DIV class=""field-item even""><P>This week saw two oil companies take two very different approaches to <mark>climate change</mark>. One has recognised the impact that global efforts to cut emissions will have on its bottom line while the other denies <mark>climate</mark> action will have any adverse impact.
	I’m talking about Shell and Chevron. Both behemoths in the energy world but with drastically opposite views sitting on either side of the Atlantic.
	This week <A href=""http://www.shell.com/investors/financial-reporting/annual-publications.html#vanity-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zaGVsbC5jb20vYW5udWFscmVwb3J0"">Shell released its latest annual report</A> for the year up to December 2015. Reading through it, it quickly becomes clear that the company has started joining the dots on <mark>climate change</mark> following the <A href=""//www.desmog.co.uk/2015/12/12/historic-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-major-leap-mankind"">Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement</A> and mounting shareholder pressure.</P><P>The risk of <mark>climate change</mark> to the company is disclosed in-depth: “Rising <mark>climate change</mark> concerns have led and could lead to additional legal and/or regulatory measures which could result in project delays or cancellations, a decrease in demand for fossil fuels and additional compliance obligations, and therefore could adversely impact our costs and/or revenue.”
	It then goes on to talk about the impact increased attention to <mark>climate change</mark> across society will have on its operations, recognising that regulations on greenhouse gas emissions “will focus more on suppressing demand for fossil fuels. This could result in lower revenue.”
	This is a much clearer recognition of the risks posed by <mark>climate change</mark> to a fossil fuel company than Shell had disclosed in the past.<A href=""http://reports.shell.com/annual-report/2014/servicepages/welcome.php"">Last year</A> it stated things more simply: “Rising <mark>climate change</mark> concerns could lead to additional regulatory measures that may result in project delays and higher costs.” There was no mention of the legal risks or direct impact to the company’s profits.<STRONG>Risk Disclosure</STRONG>
	This shift in public risk disclosure is a clear recognition from Shell that policy action and legal risks are mounting. And after the past year Shell’s experienced, it’s a wise move.
	Last May, the oil company’s <A href=""//www.desmog.co.uk/2015/05/19/shell-faces-shareholder-backlash-over-arctic-drilling"">shareholders voted unanimously</A> in favour of a resolution that forced Shell to consider the possibility of a 2C world in its forecasting. Until that time Shell had been <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/17/shell-accused-of-strategy-risking-catastrophic-<mark>climate</mark>-change?CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2"">using a 4C to 6C global warming scenario</A> to guide future business operations (twice the level of warming considered safe for the planet).
	Then, in September Shell was forced to <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/28/shell-ceases-alaska-arctic-drilling-exploratory-well-oil-gas-disappoints"">abandon its plans to drill for Arctic oil</A> off the coast of Alaska citing high costs, uncertain regulatory environment, and the failure to find enough oil and gas to drill. After months of protests against Shell’s Arctic drilling, green campaigners declared this a victory for the environment.
	Finally, it’s hard to ignore the impact of the ‘Exxon knew’ campaign. Last September it was revealed that <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken"">Exxon knew that <mark>climate change</mark> was caused by humans</A> burning fossil fuels long before it went on to promote <mark>climate</mark> science denial and misinformation campaigns. Based on this, New York and California have launched investigations into the oil giant.
	And now, <A href=""http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-congress-shell-<mark>climate</mark>-change-20160218-story.html"">calls have come for a similar investigation</A> to be launched into Shell – did it also deceive the public on <mark>climate change</mark>?
	You can see how this all might push a company into acknowledging the very real financial, regulatory, and legal risks posed to it by <mark>climate change</mark>.<STRONG>Chevron's Position</STRONG>
	Meanwhile, at the other end of the spectrum Chevron is singing a different tune.
	It <A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e34575d6-e603-11e5-a09b-1f8b0d268c39.html#axzz42UQ9czMH"">told the <EM>Financial Times</EM></A> this week that the world will always need Big Oil. Rather than taking a more humble, forward-thinking approach, Chevron’s <SPAN class=""caps"">CEO</SPAN> John Watson boasted that “arguably, we’ve never been more advantaged than right now.”
	As the <EM><SPAN class=""caps"">FT</SPAN></EM>writes: “The idea that curbs on greenhouse gas emissions put the long-term viability of the oil industry at risk has been gaining ground among investors, but John Watson doubts that <mark>climate</mark> policies will be a threat to Chevron.”
	Do a quick search through <A href=""http://www.chevron.com/annualreport/2014/documents/pdf/Chevron2014AnnualReport.pdf"">Chevron’s most recent annual report for 2014</A> (presumably this year’s report for 2015 is in the works) and you’ll find that the company only mentions the words ‘<mark>climate change</mark>’ once <SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;"">–</SPAN> in the context of increased regulations on greenhouse gas emissions.
	Chevron, along with Exxon, has a reputation for not engaging on <mark>climate change</mark>. While European oil majors including Shell signed a joint declaration supporting action on <mark>climate change</mark> ahead of the Paris <SPAN class=""caps"">COP21</SPAN> <mark>climate</mark> conference in December, the two American companies were noticeable in their absence. <STRONG>Public Pressure</STRONG>
	Of course, Shell still has room for improvement – I won’t be letting it off the hook that easy.
	The joint <mark>climate</mark> declaration was <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/oil-companies-deny-that-joint-<mark>climate</mark>-pledge-is-lip-service"">criticised for being little more than hot air</A> given the industry's history of actively lobbying against <mark>climate</mark> action. <SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;"">Last April </SPAN><A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/27/shell-lobbied-to-undermine-eu-renewables-targets-documents-reveal"" style=""line-height: 17.6px;"">it was revealed</A><SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;""> that Shell successfully lobbied to undermine European renewable energy targets. Instead, it argued that Europe’s transition to a low <mark>carbon</mark> energy system should focus on gas expansion.</SPAN>
	And as Shell's annual report states, its own internal forecasting assumes an average global temperature increase of 2-3C by 2100 – this is higher than the internationally agreed target of limiting warming to “well below 2C” with the aim of achieving 1.5C. 
	In fact, at <SPAN class=""caps"">COP21</SPAN> David Hone, Shell's head of <mark>climate change</mark>, <A href=""https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/adam-ramsay/gate-crashing-inner-sanctum-of-elite-at-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-talks"">told Adam Ramsay of openDemocracy</A> that oil companies don't see holding warming of the planet to two degrees as “a given”. This view is confirmed in its report, which reads: “Based on the above analysis, we believe current oil, gas and <SPAN class=""caps""><mark>CO2</mark></SPAN> prices are too low to stimulate the fossil fuel substitution necessary to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the average global temperature increase to well below 2°C.”
	But what Shell’s recent admission does is it recognises that public pressure for action on <mark>climate change</mark> is only going to keep increasing. And, it shows that this pressure is starting to be felt at the very heart of the fossil fuel industry.

The unusual hearing was required by Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing lawsuits filed by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland claiming that five oil giants are contributing to damages related to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>In the hours before the tutorial, which Alsup is using to gather historical observations about climatic conditions that can go back thousands of years, Chevron said it wouldn’t question the facts around rising temperatures.</P><P>“Chevron is not going to be engaging in a debate on <mark>climate change</mark> science,” said Avi Garbow, co-chairman of the Environmental Litigation and Mass Tort Practice Group at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP and a Chevron lawyer. He’s also a former official in the Obama administration who defended the Clean Power Plan as general counsel to then-U.S. EPA chief Gina McCarthy.</P><P>The company will “anchor its presentation” on the Fifth Assessment Report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC), issued in 2014, he said on a call with reporters Monday.</P><P>“Chevron’s neither going to overstate nor understate degrees of confidence. Chevron’s simply going to present the conclusions of the IPCC because Chevron thinks that’s the best and the most accurate way of responding to the court’s tutorial request,” Garbow said.</P><P>San Francisco and Oakland, along with several counties in California, are suing Chevron, BP PLC, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> PLC for allegedly downplaying the threat of <mark>climate change</mark>. The local governments claim that the oil majors knew years ago that the emissions related to their products could cause sea-level rise and contribute to other damages.</P><P>Earlier this month, Alsup asked the cities and oil companies to answer nine questions, including “What are the main sources of <mark>CO2</mark> that account for the incremental buildup of <mark>CO2</mark> in the atmosphere?” and “What are the main sources of heat that account for the incremental rise in temperature on Earth?”</P><P>He also asked the cities to produce documents referred to in their suits that deal with the extent to which the oil companies knew about the risks of <mark>climate change</mark>. Those documents have been submitted to the court.</P><P>Despite its open approach to the science hearing, Chevron yesterday filed a <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/assets/2018/03/20/document_gw_20.pdf"">motion</A> to dismiss the suits. So did ConocoPhillips, which claimed that the cases lack jurisdiction because it’s a Delaware company headquartered in Houston.</P><P>Chevron said claims that are similar to those filed by San Francisco and Oakland have been dismissed by other courts. Its key argument is that U.S. EPA has oversight over greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>“This is not the first (or even the second or third) time a plaintiff has tried to plead global warming-related tort claims,” Chevron’s motion said. “Similar claims have been considered, and dismissed, by the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit, and district courts around the country.”</P><P>Oil companies beyond Chevron declined to say if they would make presentations at today’s hearing or defer to Chevron. A spokesman for Exxon Mobil criticized the lawsuits.</P><P>“Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions,” Scott Silvestri said in an email. “Lawsuits of this kind—filed by trial attorneys against an industry that provides products we all rely upon to power the economy and enable our domestic life—simply do not do that.”</P><P>The cities’ attorneys declined to reveal their strategies for the hearing. San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said he “looks forward to providing the objective history of <mark>climate change</mark> science and the consensus science on future impacts. It’s time for <mark>climate</mark> science to have its day in court.”</P><P>“These companies knew their products were causing sea-level rise, and they deceived people about it,” Herrera added. “Now, that bill has come due.”</P><H2>On the record</H2><P>The oil companies have no real choice but to acknowledge <mark>climate</mark> science, legal experts said.</P><P>“They realize that the science behind <mark>climate change</mark> is so well understood and accepted that it isn’t in their interest to be seen as deniers,” Ann Carlson, co-director of the Emmett Institute on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the Environment, said in an email. “Moreover, their own internal documents and research accept the validity of <mark>climate change</mark> and for several of them they’ve made public statements acknowledging the human contribution to <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>She added, “They’re really hedging their bets, instead, on the large number of contributors to <mark>climate change</mark>, the causation questions, the global nature of the problem, and the hope that they can get courts to find that federal common law (at least) displaces nuisance claims.”</P><P>On the call with reporters, Chevron attorneys said it’s not possible to pin the cause of warming on a handful of oil companies. The cities in their suits say that the consumption of fossil fuels has created harms, said Joshua Lipshutz, a partner at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher and a Chevron lawyer.</P><P>“If that’s the allegation, then really anyone in the world could be brought in in the case, including the plaintiffs themselves,” he said. “San Francisco and Oakland are large consumers of fossil fuels and large emitters of greenhouse gas emissions.”</P><P>The Chevron lawyers discounted research attempting to pinpoint sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Garbow said it’s not emphasized in the IPCC report, which is considered scientific consensus.</P><P>“It is, as far as I’m aware, a line of, if you will, scientific study or inquiry that is not very developed, and certainly not at this juncture widely accepted by any stretch,” Garbow said.</P><P>Daniel Farber, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an email that the oil companies may try to show that there was “more uncertainty until recently” in terms of <mark>climate</mark> science.</P><P>Garbow, the Chevron lawyer, noted “that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-20th century.”</P><P>Farber said showing that uncertainty existed years ago might help the companies fight accusations that they knew the risks and “were simply lying in their public statements or were completely irresponsible to oppose regulation at earlier points in time—whether it helps them enough isn’t clear to me.”</P><P>Farber said it’s noteworthy that the oil companies plan to acknowledge that <mark>climate</mark> science is accurate.</P><P>“Most or all of the major oil corporations have now acknowledged the reality of <mark>climate change</mark> and the need for government action (though who knows how serious they are about that),” he said. “So it would be hard for them to take a contrary view in this litigation. Getting them to say the same thing in court will be kind of a victory for the plaintiffs even if nothing else goes their way.”</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>wire with permission from E&amp;E News.

Others, however, contend that the conversation on <mark>climate</mark> has shifted away from hard-liners, with a growing number of Republicans and conservatives embracing clean technology and <mark>climate</mark> science, according to several of the group's members.</P><P>&quot;I think the attention they got on energy and environmental issues was so intense that that's where they focused on their outreach with the center-left,&quot; said Paul Blair, director of strategic initiatives with Americans for Tax Reform and a member of ALEC. &quot;You can't pass the laugh test with going center-left on tax issues. To me, you can't pass the laugh test with me by going center-left on energy and environment issues. But they apparently think they can.&quot;</P><P>It's a fight that reflects the broader conservative debate over <mark>climate change</mark> and the direction of the Republican Party during the Trump administration.</P><P>And it will soon come to a head, as ALEC members prepare to vote on a measure that takes aim at U.S. EPA's endangerment finding on greenhouse gases. The Obama-era finding is a compilation of scientific evidence that forms the legal basis for EPA greenhouse gas regulations. It's despised by many conservatives.</P><SECTION class=""ad medium""><P class=""label"">Advertisement</P></SECTION><P>ALEC's Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force is slated to vote on a draft <A href=""https://www.alec.org/model-policy/resolution-calling-for-epa-review-of-the-2009-endangerment-finding-for-greenhouse-gases/"">resolution</A> at a meeting in Nashville, Tenn., next month that calls &quot;upon the Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw the 2009 endangerment finding for <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and other greenhouse gases and conduct a new rulemaking on this issue.&quot;</P><P>If ALEC ultimately adopts the resolution, it will serve as a model resolution for state and federal lawmakers to express their disdain for the EPA finding. The vote will put big businesses and trade groups that sit on the ALEC task force on the spot regarding whether the endangerment finding is worth investigating.</P><P>&quot;Robust debate comes from stakeholders engaging from a variety of perspectives. And that is precisely what's happening here,&quot; said ALEC spokesman Bill Meierling. He noted that the draft resolution could be amended or changed when the task force meets in Nashville.</P><P>The tug of war at ALEC mirrors the fight between voices skeptical of mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science — like the nonprofit Heartland Institute — and groups that are more moderate on <mark>climate change</mark>, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</P><P>Heartland is rumored to be behind the endangerment resolution, with former North Dakota state Rep. Bette Grande (R) — who now freelances for Heartland and participates in ALEC matters — thought to have drafted it and handed off the language to a state lawmaker and ALEC member.</P><P>Heartland did not respond to a request for comment.</P><P>Heartland and its allies have pushed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to take on the endangerment finding, which the EPA chief has been reluctant to pursue. Corporate America, meanwhile, largely supported staying in the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement and retaining the Clean Power Plan — an Obama administration rule to curb power plant emissions — but ultimately lost those battles to far-right groups, though some hope Trump will ultimately remain in the global <mark>climate</mark> pact.</P><H3>Bellwether moment?</H3><P>The endangerment finding vote may serve as a bellwether for where ALEC stands on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Is ALEC part and parcel of a conservative movement that has questioned <mark>climate change</mark> and the policy responses to it? Or does it operate among the wider atmosphere of reputation-conscious corporations and even some moderates who have opposed the Trump administration on <mark>climate change</mark>?</P><P>But that calculation also belies a more fundamental point about ALEC — while it has a reputation as a far-right group advancing industry interests, it's also a member-driven organization. If ALEC is shifting on <mark>climate</mark> and energy, it's largely because its members have, too.</P><P>&quot;If there were some grand conspiracy, I'd know about it, and there isn't,&quot; said Eli Lehrer, president of the free-market think tank R Street Institute, which supports a <mark>carbon</mark> tax. &quot;To the extent things have changed, it's because opinions have changed.&quot;</P><P>At its core, ALEC is an organization about free markets and limited government. Thus, its members also have railed against and helped craft bills to roll back President Obama's <mark>climate</mark> and environmental measures, many of which were federal regulations, and local incentives for clean energy. At the same time, though, the group has come under fire for taking cash from fossil fuel companies threatened by the advance of clean energy while often neglecting to mention subsidies and incentives that legacy energy sources enjoy.</P><P>Longtime ALEC watchdogs view the endangerment finding draft resolution as an attempt by its conservative members to reorient the organization to its roots after several rudderless years on energy and environment matters. Part of that is a response to the Trump administration, said Nick Surgey, director of Documented, an organization that tracks the influence of corporations on public policy.</P><P>&quot;This is a reflection of an organization that has shifted itself more into the mainstream of <mark>climate change</mark> in terms of rhetoric in the last three to four years,&quot; Surgey said. &quot;Now they've got almost everything they want from Scott Pruitt and the EPA, and they have to justify their existence to their funders. And it seems like they're allying themselves with the more radical of the funders.&quot;</P><P>The cohesion between ALEC and the Trump administration is evident to ALEC CEO Lisa Nelson. She sent a congratulatory email to its members on Jan. 30 to celebrate the new administration, saying, &quot;This administration does have the potential to be an ALEC administration. It is full of the people and ideas we've advanced since 1973.&quot;</P><P>But conservatives familiar with ALEC said they're concerned that the organization has gravitated to satisfying interests that aren't committed to the free-market principles upon which the group was created. They said that dynamic is most apparent in the energy and environment space.</P><P>&quot;When it comes to the policies of the organization, ALEC does have strong positions on issues that are consistent with the free market,&quot; Blair said. &quot;The issue is if they are planning to upend those principles to fundraise in the future.&quot;</P><P>They worry that ALEC is trying to plug a funding gap following the high-profile exits of Google, BP PLC, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> PLC and others, all of which blamed the organization's stance on <mark>climate change</mark> for their departure. Those companies left largely over pressure from shareholders who were spurred into action after activist groups harped on ALEC funding streams. The conservative billionaire industrialist Koch brothers are big donors; Exxon Mobil Corp., a member of the Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force, is also a major funder.</P><H3>Conservatives revolt</H3><P>ALEC's conservative members saw warning signs recently when feathers were ruffled over what they said in the past would have been a fairly easy decision.</P><P>The energy task force couldn't agree to move on a resolution that opposed property assessed clean energy, or PACE — a financing mechanism to fund clean energy or energy efficiency upgrades. Conservatives were worried about exposing taxpayers to losses, since municipal bonds underwrote many of the projects.</P><P>But many of ALEC's members also have PACE interests. One conservative source said those groups backing PACE angled to kill the resolution and criticized ALEC for trying to appease such funders. Rockwood Group CEO Scott Zajac, whose investment firm operates in the PACE world, was particularly vocal in opposing the resolution within ALEC, the source said.</P><P>Others, though, noted that's just how the energy space is these days — corporations are on board with clean energy. Rejecting mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science or trying to stymie growth of energy sources that compete with ALEC's old guard of coal, natural gas and oil companies doesn't fly anymore.</P><P>The PACE resolution foundered over much acrimony in ALEC's July meeting and was forbidden to ever return as a discussion point. That result has generated revolt from some of the more dogmatic conservatives.</P><P>&quot;I'm concerned that there has been an effort more recently to try and table what in the past would have been considered straightforward proposals based on free-market principles,&quot; said Tom Pyle, president of the conservative energy think tank Institute for Energy Research. &quot;That's what ALEC is supposed to be advancing.&quot;</P><P>That effort, though, is minor compared with the endangerment finding, which is a lightning rod in <mark>climate policy</mark> circles.</P><P>Publicly traded companies on the Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force are getting calls about the upcoming vote on the draft endangerment finding resolution, according to a source familiar with the situation.

The lawsuits, filed by Democratic Party politicians, are part of a larger campaign to address <mark>climate change</mark> in the courts. Worldwide, there are almost 900 lawsuits on <mark>climate change</mark> in 25 countries, a U.N. study said last year.U.S. District Judge William Alsup invited both sides to a hearing on Wednesday to describe their views on &quot;the best science now available on global warming, glacier melt, sea rise, and coastal flooding.&quot;Since U.S. President <A href=""https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/donald+trump"">Donald Trump</A> took office 14 months ago, domestic policy on <mark>climate change</mark> has been turned on its head. Republican Trump has pushed to increase production of fossil fuels and ordered a broad reversal of <mark>climate</mark> regulations. He said last year that he was withdrawing the <A href=""https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/united+states"">United States</A> from the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions but Washington has not disengaged from it completely.Alsup, who has presided over high profile technology cases including one between Alphabet's Waymo and Uber Technologies Inc over self-driving cars, is known to ask blunt questions from the bench.Chevron attorney Avi Garbow on Tuesday told reporters the company will tell the judge it agrees with the scientific consensus that it is extremely likely human influence is the cause of warming. It is unclear whether the other companies will agree with that view.Representatives for the other four companies could not immediately be reached. All of the oil companies generally acknowledge that greenhouse gasses are a contributor to <mark>climate change</mark>. However, the companies argued in court papers on Tuesday that they should not be held liable for global warming, which is caused by &quot;billions&quot; of parties and &quot;complex environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades.&quot;</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""embedgroup storyrelatedcontent clearfix  hide""><H3>RELATED</H3></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Sound unfair? Add this insane reasoning to the fact that dozens of other industrialized nations are apparently blameless for any of the planet’s <mark>climate</mark>-related woes. Operators of airlines, asphalt factories, cement plants, auto dealerships and heavy machinery in New York or California are likewise off the hook for any <mark>climate change</mark>-related issues. </P><P>These lefty mayors suggest that because the earth’s <mark>climate</mark> is changing, they might incur expenses years down the road for possible sea level rise, storms, etc., so they want our oil and natural gas producers to pay hundreds of billions in undefined damages.</P><P>A U.S. district judge in California scheduled a hearing to listen to both sides of the debate in a “tutorial” on <mark>climate change</mark>. While the energy industry presented logical facts, trial lawyers representing these liberal metropolises offered a tried-and-failed retread of legal claptrap. Importantly, the judge dismissed the notion of a conspiracy by energy companies to suppress global warming science.  Referring to one of the documents he reviewed, the judge said, “I read that paragraph 67 the same way; that there was a conspiratorial document within the defendants about how they knew good and well that global warming was right around the corner.  And I said: ‘Okay. That's going to be a big thing. I want to see it.’ Well, it turned out it wasn't quite that.”</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""pull-quote""><P class=""quote-text"">In 2011, six Midwest power companies faced the same legal nonsense.

All of the defendants joined in a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, in which they reiterated arguments from their March 20 motion to dismiss the original complaint: that federal common law claims were either displaced by federal statutes or were “plainly improper”; that the plaintiffs failed to allege the elements of a nuisance claim; and that even if the plaintiffs pleaded a viable claim, judicial resolution would be inappropriate because it would violate separation of powers. Each defendant other than Chevron Corporation also filed a new motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> plc (Shell) again also sought dismissal on the basis of insufficient service of process. The defendants addressed four questions that the court on March 27 had requested be addressed in the briefing on the motion to dismiss. They said they were aware of no cases sustaining a nuisance theory of liability based on the otherwise lawful sale of a product where the seller finance or sponsored research or advertising intended to cast doubt on studies showing that use of the product was harmful. They also told the court that “no global-warming-based nuisance claim has ever made it past the pleadings,” argued that the plaintiffs sought to hold them liable for speech “plainly immunized” by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, and asserted that the plaintiffs’ “expansive theory of liability has no limiting principle.” The plaintiffs’ response to the motions to dismiss was due by May 3, and defendants’ replies were due by May 10. The court had also set a deadline of May 10 for the United States to submit an amicus brief if it wished to do so. A hearing on the motions to dismiss was scheduled for May 24. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/19/2018</TD><TD>Motion to dismiss first amended complaints for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by BP p.l.c.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/18/2018</TD><TD>Motion filed by United States for extension of time to consider whether to participate as amicus curiae.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/18/2018</TD><TD>Order issued setting deadline of May 10, 2018 for United States to file amicus brief.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/04/2018</TD><TD>Redlined first amended complaint filed by plaintiffs (San Francisco).</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/04/2018</TD><TD>Redlined first amended complaint filed by plaintiffs (Oakland).</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/04/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180404_docket-317-cv-06011_order.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Order issued setting schedules for motions to dismiss amended complaint.</TD><TD>The court deemed the March 20 motions to dismiss withdrawn, and new motions to dismiss the amended complaints are due on April 19.

Their presentation included a section comprising “a tutorial overview of <mark>climate</mark> science, covering the most essential concepts and results and highlighting fundamental problems with the claimed scientific ‘consensus,’” and also a section answering the court’s eight questions.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/23/2018</TD><TD>Court granted motion by Viscount Monckton of Brenchley et al. for leave to file an amici curiae brief.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/23/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180323_docket-317-cv-06011_request.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Request for comment issued by court regarding handling of Shell's motion to dismiss based on insufficient service of process.</TD><TD>When the court asked the parties whether it should resolve Shell’s motion challenging service before addressing the other motions and issues, both the cities and the defendants responded that doing so was not warranted. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/21/2018</TD><TD>Motion for acceptance of submission as amicus curiae filed by Concerned Household Electricity Consumers Council.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/21/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180321_docket-317-cv-06011_notice.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Court issued notice to defendants re tutorial.</TD><TD>At the tutorial, three scientists presented on behalf of Oakland and San Francisco.

The five named defendants joined in a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. First, they argued that Congress had displaced federal common law claims based on domestic activities, whether those activities involved combustion of fossil fuels (in which case the Clean Air Act displaced federal common law) or production and promotion of fossil fuels (in which case “many federal statutes … expressly regulate (and, in fact, encourage) such conduct)). The defendants also argued that federal common law principles would not support recognition of a claim based on the defendants’ foreign activities. Second, the fossil fuel companies argued that elements of a federal common law claim for public nuisance were absent. The defendants asserted (1) that the plaintiffs had not alleged and could not allege that the defendants’ conduct was unauthorized by law; (2) that it was undisputed that the defendants did not control the fossil fuels at the time of the alleged creation of the nuisance (i.e., the time of combustion); (3) that the complaint’s allegations did not establish causation, since the claims depended “on an attenuated causal chain including billions of intervening third parties—i.e., fossil fuel users like Plaintiffs themselves—and complex environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades”; and (4) that the damages sought by the plaintiffs in the form of an “abatement fund” could not be awarded because plaintiffs had not alleged actual harm, only “speculative future harms that may never eventuate.” The defendants also argued that damages would violate the defendants’ due process and First Amendment rights. Finally, the defendants asserted that judicial relief would violate separation of powers by invading the executive branch’s authority to conduct foreign affairs and legislative authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180320_docket-317-cv-06011_motion-to-dismiss-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by ConocoPhillips Company.</TD><TD>Four of the defendants filed separate motions to dismiss on personal jurisdiction grounds, arguing that the court could not exercise either general jurisdiction over the companies—two of which were non-U.S. companies and two of which were headquartered in Texas and incorporated in other states (one in New Jersey, one in Delaware)—or specific jurisdiction based on the companies’ alleged activities in and contacts with California. <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> plc also asserted that the complaint should be dismissed against it for insufficient service of process.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by Exxon Mobil Corporation.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by BP p.l.c.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, insufficient service of process, and failure to state a claim filed by <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> plc.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Response filed by Happer, Koonin, and Lindzen to court's request for information re amicus curiae materials.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Responses filed by Viscount Monckton of Brenchley et al. to court's request for information re amicus curiae materials.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Plaintiffs filed response to motions to file amicus curiae brief and tutorial presentation and statement of nonopposition.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Stipulation and order issued regarding formatting for briefing of motions to dismiss.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/19/2018</TD><TD>Administrative motion for leave to submit presentation in response to the court's tutorial questions filed by William Happer, Steven E.

Connecticut; Requested “Tutorial” on <mark>Climate Change</mark>.</STRONG> The federal district court for the Northern District of California denied Oakland’s and San Francisco’s motions to remand their <mark>climate change</mark> public nuisance lawsuits against five major fossil fuel producers to state court. The court held that federal common law necessarily governed the nuisance claims because “[a] patchwork of fifty different answers to the same fundamental global issue would be unworkable” and “the extent of any judicial relief should be uniform across our nation.” The court stated: “Plaintiffs’ claims for public nuisance, though pled as state-law claims, depend on a global complex of geophysical cause and effect involving all nations of the planet (and the oceans and atmosphere). It necessarily involves the relationships between the United States and all other nations. It demands to be governed by as universal a rule of apportioning responsibility as is available.” The court dispensed with the cities’ three primary arguments for remanding the cases. First, the court said the cities’ novel theories of liability based on the defendants’ sales of their product did not differentiate their claims from earlier transboundary <mark>pollution</mark> suits in which the Supreme Court (American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut) and Ninth Circuit (Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp.) applied federal common law. Second, the court said the Clean Air Act did not displace the plaintiffs’ federal common law claims, allowing state law to govern; the court said that while the Clean Air Act spoke directly to the “domestic emissions” issues presented in American Electric Power and Kivalina, “[h]ere, the Clean Air Act does not provide a sufficient legislative solution to the nuisance alleged to warrant a conclusion that this legislation has occupied the field to the exclusion of federal common law.” Third, the court said the well-pleaded complaint rule did not bar removal. The court also indicated in dicta that “the very instrumentality of plaintiffs’ alleged injury — the flooding of coastal lands — is, by definition, the navigable waters of the United States. Plaintiffs’ claims therefore necessarily implicate an area quintessentially within the province of the federal courts.” The court said defendants had not waived this issue. The court certified the decision for interlocutory appeal, finding that the issue of whether the nuisance claims were removable because such claims are governed by federal common law was a controlling question as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that resolution by the court of appeals would materially advance the litigation. The court’s order also noted that six similar actions brought by other California municipalities were pending before another judge in the district and those actions asserted additional non-nuisance claims. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/19/2018</TD><TD>Defendants' reply to plaintiffs' supplemental brief on navigable waters of the United States filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/19/2018</TD><TD>Plaintiffs' supplemental reply brief on navigable waters of the United States filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/16/2018</TD><TD>Defendants' response to request for supplemental briefing filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/16/2018</TD><TD>Plaintiffs' supplemental brief on navigable waters of the United States filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/12/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180212_docket-317-cv-06011_request.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Request for supplemental briefing issued.</TD><TD><STRONG>Federal Court in Oakland and California <mark>Climate Change</mark> Suits Against Fossil Fuel Producers Asked for Additional Briefing on Navigable Waters Issue.</STRONG> The federal district court for the Northern District of California considering whether to remand Oakland and San Francisco's <mark>climate change</mark> lawsuits against fossil fuel producers issued a request for supplemental briefing on the issue of how the concept of “navigable waters of the United States” related to removal jurisdiction.

The parties completed their briefing on the remand motion on January 15, 2018. In their reply in support of remand, the city attorneys asserted that the defendants’ assertions of federal jurisdiction “would federalize vast areas of traditional state law.” They emphasized that they did not seek to limit anyone’s emissions and that the only remedy sought was an “abatement fund” to shift adaptation costs from the public to the fossil fuel companies. The city attorneys also argued that the argument that the cases arose under federal law suffered from the “fatal defect” that they relied on “ordinary preemption doctrines” that did not provide a basis for removal.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>12/19/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20171219_docket-317-cv-06011_opposition.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Joint opposition to motion to remand filed by defendants.</TD><TD>In their opposition to the remand motion, the defendants asserted that the cases “implicate longstanding federal government policies, concerning matters of uniquely national importance, including the Nation’s supply of energy and the global environment” and argued that the plaintiffs’ actions necessarily were governed by federal common law and necessarily raised federal questions by seeking “to supplant federal domestic and foreigh policy on greenhouse gas emissions to hold a handful of energy producers liable for the alleged consequences of rising ocean levels on a discrete portion of the U.S. coast.” The defendants also argued that the Clean Air Act completely preempted the actions because the statute “provides the exclusive cause of action for regulation of nationwide emissions.” The defendants also reiterated their arguments that the actions were removable because they were based on the defendants’ activities on federal lands and at the direction of the federal government, and because the claims would have an impact on a number of bankruptcy proceedings, not just Texaco’s, and because exemptions from bankruptcy jurisdiction for governmental exercises of police power were construed narrowly. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>12/14/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20171214_docket-317-cv-06011_complaint-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Third-party complaint filed by Chevron Corp.</TD><TD>Chevron Corporation filed a third-party complaint against Statoil ASA—an energy company of which the Norwegian State is majority stakeholder—for indemnity and contribution.

The city attorneys also asserted that none of the other theories in the defendants’ “kitchen-sink notices of removal” had merit: the plaintiffs argued that that their claim to relief did not necessarily raise a substantial and disputed federal issue and also asserted that no court had held that the Clean Air Act completely preempted state common law public nuisance claims. The plaintiffs also said that the fact that “some unspecified portion of [the defendants’] oil and gas production occurs on federal land” did not provide a basis for removal under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act or under a “federal officer” or “federal enclave” theory of removal.

We don’t know.</P><P>What does the website say? Er, there isn’t one.</P><P>Who are the members? Well, they are not listed on its <A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=646699114665-12"">lobby register declaration</A>, but according to its president, they include the likes of ExxonMobil, Total, Dow and Google.</P><P>How many times has it met with senior Commission officials? At least 180 times since the 1990s! But shockingly, none of the five meetings held with AMISA2 between December 2014 and January 2016 by senior Commission officials has been publicly declared as required by the rules.</P><P>So what do we know about AMISA2?</P><P><STRONG>Background</STRONG></P><P>According to Georg Brodach, AMISA2’s president (who was willing to answer <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/email_exchanges_feb_2016.pdf"">CEO’s </A><A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/email_exchanges_feb_2016.pdf"">emailed </A><A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/email_exchanges_feb_2016.pdf"">questions</A>), AMISA2 holds monthly breakfast meetings, mostly with a senior speaker from one of the EU institutions, “<A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=646699114665-12"">in order to educate corporate representatives about recent developments in EU policy fields</A>”.</P><P>Brodach sent <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/01-2016_past_guest-speakers_and_topics.pdf"">a list of the </A><A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/01-2016_past_guest-speakers_and_topics.pdf"">breakfast </A><A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/01-2016_past_guest-speakers_and_topics.pdf"">meetings </A><A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/01-2016_past_guest-speakers_and_topics.pdf"">held</A> and the speakers; the list dates back to 1994 and comprised a massive 293 meetings in total. Generally, these were with senior level officials (cabinet members, directors-general or their deputies), but other familiar names crop up too. Connie Hedegaard, previous commissioner for <mark>climate</mark> action, has addressed an AMISA2 breakfast, as have the US ambassador to the EU; the Russian permanent representative to the EU; Giovanni Kessler, controversial Director General of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF); and top-EU-official-turned-tobacco-lobbyist <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/revolvingdoorwatch/cases/michel-petite"">Michel Petite</A>.</P><P>Timely meetings have been held with:</P><UL><LI>Jos Delbeke, Director General, DG CLIMA on “what outcome should business expect from the COP21 <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference in Paris” in May 2015, in the run-up to these important <mark>climate</mark> negotiations</LI><LI>Dominique Ristori, Director General, DG ENER on “The Energy Agenda” in September 2014, as the Energy Union is under-development</LI><LI>Olivier Guersent, Head of Cabinet of Michel Barnier, (then Commissioner Internal Market and Services) on the “Single Market – a Status Report” in June 2013</LI><LI>Horst Reichenbach, Head of the Taskforce for Greece, on “GREECE: Achievements and Future Challenges”, in March 2013, during the Greek debt crisis.</LI></UL><P>Georg Broadch himself, the president of AMISA2, calls himself an “Experienced Public Affairs Executive” on his <A href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/georg-brodach-1a439b"">LinkedIn profile</A> and has a history of working for major European companies. He spent 14 years with <mark>ABB</mark>, the power technology company; five years with AT&amp;T, the telecoms firm; and 10 years at German business associations.</P><P><STRONG>Corporate capture</STRONG></P><P>AMISA2’s <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2016-02-17_list_amisa2_membership_2016.pdf"">17 corporate </A><A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2016-02-17_list_amisa2_membership_2016.pdf"">members</A>, as declared to CEO by Brodach, are: <mark>ABB</mark>, Airbus, Allianz, Amgen, BASF, Bayer, Dow Europe, ExxonMobil, Google, Norsk Hydro, LyondellBasell Industries, Michelin, Oracle, PGA, F. Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche), Solvay, and Total and, judging from the attendance lists at some of the breakfasts, there is a consistency about who attends the meetings from these companies. In fact, “the rule” is that only the head of a Brussels office can participate in AMISA2 breakfast meetings, so effectively that company’s top EU lobbyist.</P><P>These organisations each pay €4000 a year to be a member of AMISA2, more than enough to keep a roomful of lobbyists in croissants and coffee for a year. Presumably these membership fees are the source of the €60,000 budget declared in AMISA2’s lobby register declaration, the majority of which is spent on lobbying. AMISA2’s <A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=646699114665-12"">decl</A><A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=646699114665-12"">a</A><A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=646699114665-12"">red lobby spend</A> for 2015 is €25,000-€49,999; it’s not known on what else it spends its money.</P><P>CEO asked AMISA2 for the minutes of these breakfast meetings so that we could see exactly what is being discussed. However, Brodach <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/email_exchanges_feb_2016.pdf"">told us</A>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“There are no minutes and there is no result, because there is no common set of interests and the intention is not to come to a “result” whatsoever … if not to learn, understand and be educated on the topic. We are not a lobbying organization.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>But we find this disingenuous. While two chemical companies, or two energy companies might be competitors in the market place, more likely than not, they will also have very similar interests when it comes to EU policy-making. Corporations across sectors share many common interests and agendas when it comes to trade, tax, regulation and other matters. If that was not so, there would be no trade associations and no role for organisations like BusinessEurope which put forward common business demands.</P><P>Additionally, DG Trade’s <A href=""http://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/2593/response/9540/attach/4/Attachment.pdf"">internal </A><A href=""http://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/2593/response/9540/attach/4/Attachment.pdf"">minutes</A> of the meeting that Jean-Luc Demarty, Director General at DG TRADE, spoke at in February 2014 on “Recent Developments of the EU Trade Agenda” indicate that corporations get plenty of opportunity to ask questions about issues which concern their business, with Demarty providing direct one-to-one answers back. If this is any indication of how the other breakfast meetings work, it is not hard to see why senior staffers from major corporations are keen to participate in AMISA2.</P><P>And these corporations represent some of Brussels’ biggest lobbyists, between them declaring at least €28,589,000 lobby spend in the last year for which figures are available, and holding 73 European Parliament access passes. According to <A href=""http://www.integritywatch.eu/"">IntegrityWatch</A>, these corporations have, between them, held 217 lobbying meetings with the top brass at the Commission since December 2014. (All data correct as of 16 May 2016 and available in <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/amisa2_members_in_lobby_register.xlsx"">this spreadsheet</A>.)</P><P>AMISA2 events are not advertised publicly and no one else attends. Oh, apart from “personal friends” of Brodach who are invited to ‘“beef-up” the audience.</P><P><STRONG>Transparency</STRONG></P><P>Notwithstanding Brodach’s candour when we approached him directly, AMISA2 is an opaque organisation and the lack of a website, or other public sources of information, is problematic.</P><P>Its members are not very open about their membership either. Of the 17 corporate members, only 5 (<mark>ABB</mark>, Amgen, Dow Europe, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, and Total) list AMISA2 in their lobby transparency declarations. The other 12 (71 per cent) do not bother.</P><P>But even more problematic, the Commission is also not transparent about its contacts with AMISA2. At least five of the breakfast meetings which have been held with AMISA2 since December 2014 have been held with top officials at the Commission who are <A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/3/2014/EN/3-2014-9004-EN-F1-1.Pdf"">now required to </A><A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/3/2014/EN/3-2014-9004-EN-F1-1.Pdf"">publish all their lobby meetings</A>.

He is a frequent visitor to countries in Asia and in particular Singapore.</P><P>He joined <mark>ABB</mark> in 2001 and was involved in managing communications around many of <mark>ABB</mark>’s corporate, management, financial and environmental issues prior to his current position. He trained as a journalist and spent seven years in newspaper and broadcast journalism.</P><P>In this exclusive interview with Eco-Business, he shares how sustainability has changed the way corporates approach businesses and what drives <mark>ABB</mark> to want to be one of the world’s leading organisations on sustainability.</P><H4><STRONG>You’ve been head of sustainability since 2006, and at <mark>ABB</mark> since 2001 so you’ve seen the company through more than a decade. Can you share with us how the concept of sustainability has evolved since those early days? </STRONG></H4><P>If I look back at sustainability in corporations, in the mid to late 90s it was quite clear that the NGOs were successful in holding bigger companies to account on their environmental performance. So for many MNCs like <mark>ABB</mark>, one of our priorities then was to get our house in order, get our processes cleaner, more efficient. We looked at reducing impact when we deployed various projects; it was a process of understanding our environment impact and about environmental sustainability.</P><P>As we crossed over the millennium into the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century, we started looking more at the social aspect. So we focused on human rights and labour issues. We also looked at the other part of the triple bottom line (of people, planet and profit) – which included the financial aspect.</P><H4><STRONG>How so? Can you elaborate?</STRONG></H4><P>Today, it’s quite clear when you look at <mark>ABB</mark>’s portfolio that a large proportion of our revenues come from products that help customers reduce their environmental impact. We’re making money from helping people help the environment, and we’ve been able to embed sustainability into all aspects of our business. </P><P>At the heart of this is some dedicated hard work by our research and development colleagues who have undertaken Life Cycle Analyses of more than 100 product groups, which result in us being able to communicate solid and reliable Environmental Product Declarations that itemize the environmental impact of every aspect of a product’s life-cycle – from extracting the raw material, manufacture, in use and recycling or disposal.</P><H4><STRONG>How has <mark>ABB</mark>’s approach to sustainability changed over this past decade?</STRONG></H4><P>About 10 years ago, for example, sustainability issues in the supply chain were not on our agenda. But slowly, it was creeping up the agenda for the power industry, and was even affecting industries such as sports manufacturing. It was something that <mark>ABB</mark> didn’t think applied to it in a critical way, but it became quite clear that what happened in the consumer industry will at some stage hit the capital goods market.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><H2 class=""quote"">“</H2><P>One area we are perhaps lacking is being recognised for our contributions to a better world. We have lots of opportunities to do this and base our story on solid data and evidence. I would never greenwash. My intention is that <mark>ABB</mark>’s stories are backed by solid data.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>So we began to convince colleagues who headed supply chain that we should have some sort of oversight. Over the last three years, we’ve been working with the head of supply chain and his team to implement a supplier sustainability programme and that trains our key suppliers, particularly in India and China, on the expectations we have.</P><P>This involves addressing issues such as how we expect them to behave on social, health, safety and basic things like labour rights, like paying people the right amount of money for the work they did. We started auditing and found that they were not complying in some areas, so we decided we would go higher up the chain and we implemented a training programme to ensure suppliers understood our expectations. So it’s still a work in progress.</P><P>Sustainability is a journey and not a destination. As long as we have some milestones on our route, and we have a positive direction, then we can make some progress. I would never claim that we’ve arrived at any of our objectives or KPIs – it’s an improvement process.</P><H4><STRONG>One of <mark>ABB</mark>’s objectives, as stated publicly, is to become recognised as one of the world’s leading organisations in sustainability – where is <mark>ABB</mark> on that journey? What are some challenges you forsee in fulfilling this vision?</STRONG></H4><P>Yes of course it’s a very ambitious target to be recognised as the world’s leading companies in <mark>sustainable</mark> practices. We certainly have pockets of excellence, and we are focused on minimizing and reducing our impact. I think our health and safety performance is probably not as mature as we expected and we will double our efforts in that area.</P><P>In areas such as supply chain sustainability, I think we are making good progress. For example, we are looking at suppliers in Malaysia in the coming year and adding to India, China and Mexico, we will also include the Middle East and Saudi Arabia.</P><P>In terms of community and local stakeholder engagement, we have set some minimum activity level and standards for that engagement. For example, we have developed a standard way to engage stakeholders in a formal dialogue so we can capture their inputs from a standardised process across different countries. </P><P>In addition, while we think we make some good contributions to local communities, we have developed a tool to help us identify appropriate causes to support and to measure the positive impact of that support. One area we are perhaps lacking is being recognised for our contributions to a better world. We have lots of opportunities to do this and base our story on solid data and evidence. I would never greenwash. My intention is that <mark>ABB</mark>’s stories are backed by solid data.</P><H4><STRONG>What motivates <mark>ABB</mark>? Not all engineering companies have this focus.</STRONG></H4><P>I’ll use a hackneyed anology. We’re pushing at an open door with regards to <mark>ABB</mark> and sustainability. There are inherent qualities and benefits in reducing energy use, optimising resource use, helping customers get more bangs for their buck… this addresses all three aspects – social, economic and environmental.</P><P>So for me, it’s not that <mark>ABB</mark> has to step outside normal business activities and think about being <mark>sustainable</mark>, it’s increasingly how we do things in <mark>ABB</mark> as a mainstream activity – a business imperative.</P><H4><STRONG>Have there been instances where <mark>ABB</mark> has had to make a tough decision between bottom line performance and sustainability environmental considerations? </STRONG></H4><P>Yes, there are some examples. Sustainability is a major consideration whenever we review projects. We have a seat at the table when major projects are being discussed, and we’ve looked at it from the technical, financial and sustainability point of view.</P><P>We have walked away from bidding on projects on the basis of concerns about human rights impact. If we are not necessarily going to be able to manage the risks, then we must consider the impact it will have on our reputation.</P><P>For instance, there was a small customer project where we were concerned about forced labour issues and we declined to supply products in the end. We have such a multitude of customers across the globe, and we are held to account to our most demanding of customers even if they’re not buying from us at the moment.</P><P>If we’re highlighted in the press as helping others abuse communities and human rights, others will start asking us what we’re doing, and we don’t want to have those conversations with our customers. Avoiding the hazard – instead of managing the risk – is the better option. But we are in the business to make money, so managing the risk – if it is not a ‘deal-breaker’-  is very often something that we might end up having to do.</P><P>We are also very thorough, open and honest in identifying the risks, and we have a plan on how best to mitigate them and that can involve social, environment, health and safety, or security aspects as well.</P><H4><STRONG>In Asia, where the awareness of sustainability is minimal in some developing countries, do you face difficulties talking about these issues to your suppliers and clients? How do you approach this?</STRONG></H4><P>In Asia, it’s extremely varied. The awareness level ranges from absolute zero to 100 per cent. It’s something that is relatively new in business anyway, but the awareness is growing. To me, it demonstrates how exceptionally fast companies in the region are in terms of learning these so-called ‘non-financial ’issues.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><H2 class=""quote"">“</H2><P>It’s a win-win. We tell them (suppliers): look after your people, be a good corporate citizen, and they also end up doing more business because other global companies will buy from them.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>They are concerned not because they want to be at the forefront of human rights development, but they understand that if you want to win a project, you must do it with considerations for human rights. That’s a “permission to do business” issue and a profitability issue. If you get projects wrong in countries like in India, for example, you can expect the local community to let you know in a direct way that they don’t like it. Some have been known to barricade your roads, and these disruptions cost money. It’s better if you assess what the critical issues are early and manage them with a plan.</P><P>With regards to our contractors and suppliers, we had a wake-up call about two years ago. We thought we would do a simple audit and address some non-compliance issues and get suppliers to fix it. But in some cases, you have to explain in very simple and basic terms what you expect them to do, such as it’s not okay to put polluted water into a drain or chuck your waste in a backyard where children can get injured.</P><P>But once you start talking to them about these topics, they are very fast to appreciate the value they bring to the business. We had one supplier in India who didn’t want to come to training, and didn’t want anything to do with our audit programmes. Eventually, we got them involved and a year later, they came back saying they were 20 per cent more productive. It’s a win-win. We tell them: look after your people, be a good corporate citizen, and they also end up doing more business because other global companies will buy from them.</P><P>We’re not on a crusade to correct all the ills in the global supply chain, but within our remit, we certainly want to improve capacity and performance.</P><H4><STRONG>Does <mark>ABB</mark>’s sustainability efforts help it win customers? How about in Asia?</STRONG></H4><P>I think it certainly does. We conducted a brand perception survey here and one of the things <mark>ABB</mark> was recognised for was corporate citizenship, so sustainability is linked to our brand as well as to power and <mark>innovation</mark>.</P><P>There’s much more we can do on the sustainability side. There are many on-going discussions now about <mark>sustainable</mark> development, and we have the technology to make it happen today, rather than tomorrow. Our strong credentials also helps us to conduct dialogue on these issues around the world.</P><H4><STRONG>How do you view <mark>ABB</mark>’s role in advancing sustainability in Singapore – and more broadly in Asia- given that it has become more important in this region?</STRONG></H4><P>We see it as a tremendous growth opportunity. There’s a lot more we can do in terms of the technologies and projects that we are involved globally, and there huge opportunities for similar projects in the region. Our solutions could help the region’s development tremendously. For example, in Indonesia, almost half the population do not have access to regular electricity so <mark>ABB</mark> can be quite central to that infrastructural development and we can raise sustainability in a number of ways through our projects.</P><H4><STRONG>You were a journalist before, so can you share what stories on <mark>ABB</mark>’s sustainability journey have stood out for you?</STRONG></H4><P>There are a couple – the community impact of <mark>ABB</mark> has been quite large and global, particularly in Asia. For example, the <mark>ABB</mark> Juergen Dormann Foundation was set up in 2007 to promote and support engineering education in different parts of the world.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><H2 class=""quote"">“</H2><P>Ultimately, the story about sustainability is that every day, when <mark>ABB</mark> people get up and go to work, they are making a contribution for a more <mark>sustainable</mark> world… We’re both making money and saving the planet. It’s a pretty good gig.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>It was set up to mark Dormann’s contribution in helping <mark>ABB</mark> turn the corner in early 2000. When he retired, <mark>ABB</mark> put several million dollars into a fund that would help educate students who come from poorer backgrounds in engineering. In South Asia, for example, we have relationships with three universities in Malaysia, India and Vietnam, and worldwide the foundation has supported 70 to 80 students gain degrees that they wouldn’t have been able to achieve otherwise.</P><P>Some of them have even come to work for <mark>ABB</mark>, so that’s a great closed loop. We make a contribution to educate an individual, and we benefit from a highly-skilled engineer who enters our workforce and makes a contribution. It’s truly heartwarming, and it also illustrates how there are business benefits to such programmes. It’s a win-win situation.</P><P>Ultimately, the story about sustainability is that every day, when <mark>ABB</mark> people get up and go to work, they are making a contribution for a more <mark>sustainable</mark> world, just through their work, in making products and solutions that are more energy efficient. We’re both making money and saving the planet. It’s a pretty good gig.</P><DIV class=""eb-circle__story-cta""><H3>Thanks for reading to the end of this story!</H3><P>We would be grateful if you would consider joining as a member of The EB Circle.

Access to electricity is key for a de-<mark>carbon</mark>izing economy as we realize that fossil fuel and conventional resources are finite and also heavily polluting. <mark>ABB</mark>’s focus from a business as well as a CSR perspective is not only to promote and bring in solar and other forms of renewable energy to remote areas, but also make sure that the ensuing economic activities do not increase the <mark>carbon</mark> foot print.</P><P>As far as sustainability is concerned, <mark>ABB</mark>’s products and solutions are geared towards efficient generation, transmission and distribution of electricity – a key factor in mitigating the impact of <mark>climate change</mark>. <mark>ABB</mark>’s solutions for energy efficiency are also geared to render industrial processes more efficient and environment friendly. In other words, our business as well as sustainability activities are aimed at decoupling of growth from environmental impact. <mark>ABB</mark> globally also works with organizations like World Business Council for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development as well as the United Nation’s “<mark>sustainable</mark> energy 4 all” project. The latter constitutes providing expertise for drafting energy efficiency standards for commonly used appliances as well as on distribution transformers and high efficiency motors.</P><P><STRONG>2. What have been some of the greatest challenges in realizing your CSR and Sustainability goals in the past year, and how has your company overcome them?</STRONG></P><P>One of the bigger challenges have been the sustenance and continuance of our efforts through a combined and consistent implementation by the other partner agencies. We see it is as a joint effort between the communities, government agencies and corporates all working towards the same goal with varied roles.</P><P>For example <mark>ABB</mark> has been supporting government schools over several years in terms of improving and providing basic infrastructure facilities like class rooms, science labs, drinking water facility, toilets etc. However there needs to be a consistent and a well-rounded initiative by other concerned agencies to favourably impact behaviour, usage and sustenance of the project over an extended period of time. Remote areas, access, acceptability and adapting programs also have at times been challenging.</P><P><STRONG>3. Keeping in mind the targets set in the Paris accord what do you see on the horizon for corporate sustainability initiatives?</STRONG></P><P>The Paris summit in December 2015, was very fruitful in terms of brining in the urgency for global action to mitigate and cut further Greenhouse gas emissions through the adoption of the Paris Agreement. This can lead to ambitious outcomes that will have a real impact on tackling <mark>climate change</mark>. This brings in reinforcement and commitment from countries and corporates as well to focus on all possible way to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>Our greatest contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been and will be through our energy efficient and renewable energy products, systems and services that increase productivity while lowering environmental impact. As stated earlier, we also actively participate in the United Nations-driven ‘<mark>Sustainable</mark> Energy for All’ initiative to help promote energy efficient products globally.</P><P>Internally, <mark>ABB</mark> at the Group level aims to cut GHG emissions from direct use of fuels, from purchased electricity and district heating. We have set a target to reduce <mark>ABB</mark>’s energy intensity by 20 percent by 2020, from a 2013 baseline. (This includes both direct fuel consumption and the use of electricity and district heating for manufacturing processes and to operate buildings)</P><P>A lot of objectives can be achieved if we address the low hanging fruits like energy efficiency for processes and products. Adequate awareness with enabling policy framework can generate huge savings not only in material terms but also to mitigate issues pertaining to environmental impact. For a growing country like India, it is important that sustainability and clean energy is viewed as intrinsic to rather than extraneous to businesses, as an opportunity to create jobs and improve lives rather than a series of restricting compliances. It is growth with green and not one versus the other – <mark>sustainable</mark> technologies will lead the way.</P><P><STRONG>4. What are your goals for 2016 and your priorities for the year?</STRONG></P><P>We would have continued focus on the five main CSR focal area of the Company namely:</P><UL><LI><EM>Education and Skill development</EM>: To provide facilities and assist promotion of primary education among children and impart skills training to the youth</LI><LI><EM>Access to Electricity</EM>: Collaborating to provide innovative off-grid solutions to provide and improve access to electricity in the country</LI><LI><EM>Healthcare</EM>: To support and augment ongoing national initiatives on health, hygiene and health care systems</LI><LI><EM>Environment and Local Safeguard:</EM> To undertake greening and environmental initiatives in the community</LI><LI><EM>Differently abled</EM>: To catalyze skills training and employment opportunities for the differently abled</LI></UL><P>We would continue and sustain efforts to identify areas and communities where we can affect our renewable energy/micro grid projects for community use. We would like to use our internal expertise and technical footprint to render our CSR services and solutions for community betterment. Focus will be on renewable energy especially solar, microgrids and to provide where possible, <mark>ABB</mark> expertise and products for community use.</P></DIV><DIV class=""disclaimer""> DISCLAIMER : Views expressed above are the author's own. </DIV><DIV class=""panel authors mobile-authors sidebarPanelNew""><DIV class=""panel-heading""><H3 class=""panel-title"">Blog</H3></DIV><DIV class=""panel-body""><DIV>The blog aims to both create awareness about CSR and Sustainability as well as reflect on policy and strategic issues. </DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""panel authors mobile-authors sidebarPanelNew""><DIV class=""panel-heading""><H3 class=""panel-title"">Author</H3></DIV><DIV class=""panel-body""><A class=""media-heading"" pg=""Blog_Article_AuthorProfile"" title=""Go to the profile of N.

Attracting manufacturers such as Audi, Jaguar, Mahindra, Renault and, from the 2019-20 season, Mercedes and Porsche, the electric single-seater series is in a position of enviably rude health.</P><P>The <A href=""/node/225290"" target=""_blank"">addition of electronics giant <mark>ABB</mark> as a title sponsor in a multi-year deal</A>, however, is potentially the biggest coup so far, with some suggesting an annual fee of around $15 million finding its way into the coffers.</P><P>It flies in the face of the current motor sport <mark>climate</mark>, one in which Santander has pulled its $40 million annual sponsorship of Formula 1 and Ferrari to enter the Champions League in 2018; McLaren enters another new season lacking a major sponsor; NASCAR continues to wrestle with Monster Energy to renew its contract and IndyCar has lost the support of Verizon.</P><P>By bringing on board a title sponsor that earns nearly $34 billion of revenue per year, Formula E has seemingly bucked the trend. Significantly, it could now turn a profit for the first time.</P><P>The results of the partnership, a week after FE made its announcement in London, were instantly clear at Marrakesh, with towering banners sporting the electronic giant’s name lining the circuit for its first round as sponsor.</P><P>But it wasn’t immediately clear why billboards sporting the <mark>ABB</mark> logo were there, or who <mark>ABB</mark> was. Even the company’s executives admitted that the giant suffers from a lack of identity when it comes to consumers.</P><P>“In the past, I think we were too humble as an engineering company to portray what we were contributing, which needs to change,” said Nicolas Ziegler, the head of global brand management, to a reporter from The Drum.</P><P>The trouble with longstanding energy infrastructure corporations is that they don’t have an obvious tangible product for spectators to engage with. <mark>ABB</mark> has been working behind the scenes since 1883, for example, and still anonymous to the wider world.</P><P>Those at <mark>ABB</mark> are adamant that Formula E will help the company shed its clinical image, as CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer’s impassioned speech stated: “Together, we will write the next phase of this exciting sports activity and foster high-performance teams,” he said.</P><P>“Together, we will write the future – one electrifying race at a time.”</P><P>Back at Marrakesh, <mark>ABB</mark>’s intentions were set out much more gently. A mock electronic charging station stood next to a model of its new fully electric ‘flash-charging bus’ –complete with battery changing robotic arm, which drops in a fully charged power supply from stop-to-stop.</P><P>The company also produces electric car chargers – more than 5000 are present in 56 countries around the world, with a growing business in charging networks. It should be noted that electric mobility isn’t <mark>ABB</mark>’s priority, but it’s an evolving part of a colossal firm that primarily focuses on producing the backbone behind electric grids, world over.</P><P>Those products alone make the reasoning behind its sponsorship of FE much clearer, and series founder and <A href=""https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/opinion/formula-e/formula-e-will-be-only-motor-sport"" target=""_blank"">CEO Alejandro Agag’s bullishness over the series’ staying power</A> seems to match comfortably with the tone of Spiesshofer.</P><P>Even more fitting is the fact that Morocco, which hosted the first FE round under <mark>ABB</mark> sponsorship (and the second of 2017-18), produces the fewest <mark>carbon</mark> emissions per capita out of any location in the calendar, with Chile, Mexico and Uruguay all relatively low CO<SUB>2</SUB> emitters. </P><P>Switzerland lifted its ban on motor racing for the first time in more than six decades to welcome Formula E in 2017, and it derives nearly 60 per cent of its energy from renewable sources.</P><H3>Related: <A href=""https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/september-1954/32/grosser-preis-der-schweiz"" target=""_blank"">Grosser Preis der Schweiz</A></H3><P>It is puzzling, then, as to why the United States is hosting the penultimate (or final, depending on whether FE secures a double-header on July 28-29) round after the electric grid hits Zurich on June 10.</P><P>The country is a thorn in the side of attempts to fight against <mark>climate change</mark>, with a lack of drive to reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions and no signs of its leadership tearing the country away from its lucrative stash of fossil fuels; the round in New York seems an ill-fitting way to end the season.</P><P>It’s not just the USA. The presence of Hong Kong on the calendar, which sources a negligible proportion of its energy from renewable sources and has a continuing thirst for coal, should place the series at a crossroads.</P><P>A Birmingham round has been touted to be FE’s season-ender but, with a sponsor pushing its own green credentials and a series that urges a <mark>sustainable</mark> low-emission motor sport, perhaps there are more fitting locations than the United Kingdom to host the final two races of the 2017/18 series.</P><P>The CEO of <mark>ABB</mark> also questioned the UK’s motivation to increase the capacity of its charging network at the Formula E announcement in London: “The UK has a big population that really wants to contribute to a greener, more <mark>sustainable</mark> world,” said Spiesshofer.</P><P>“But there’s always a question of whether it’s quick enough. In the next couple of years, it’s in the interest of everybody to make sure the infrastructure is coming up.”</P><P>While the series will face questions over the lack of noise, the quality of racing and the choice of circuits, its barometer of success rests on whether FE’s environmentally friendly mission with <mark>ABB</mark> contains lasting substance. Or whether it will disappear under a smoky cloud.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""block-views-related-content-block"" class=""block block-views""><H3>Related &amp; recent</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

                            Today’s increase in renewable energy production means the way electricity is generated, transmitted and distributed is changing from a traditional centralised model to a more distributed localised way of doing things. Peter Jones, technology strategy manager at <mark>ABB</mark>, explains.
                        </P><DIV class=""body-content""><P>“What we’re looking at is the idea of ‘distributed energy resource’,” says <mark>ABB</mark>’s Peter Jones. He explains the term has been coined to accommodate the fact that there are contributing factors beyond renewables that go into today’s power generation, transmission and distribution mix. “If photovoltaics (PV) or onshore wind is part of that, then so be it, but what is really important is that we are moving away from large-scale centralised generation. That’s the main issue.”</P><P>Renewables are only part of a mix covered by the term, which also includes combined heat and power (CHP) and energy storage. “One of the challenges is to operate systems that have these elements within it.” It’s a Brave New World where conventional national grids are making way for a future that includes localised micro power grids.</P><P>“Because I’ve worked with <mark>ABB</mark> for 17 years, and because I’ve come from a utilities background, I understand network planning,” says Jones. In the course of those 17 years, he has been involved in “pretty much all of the main grid technology that <mark>ABB</mark> is involved with in operational roles: high voltage DC, wind farms, energy storage, network control systems and so on. I’ve been hands-on.”</P><P>Three years ago, <mark>ABB</mark> asked Jones to review the characteristics of a changing marketplace, “and based on the toolkit of technology that we have, start clarifying what was happening specifically in the UK” with a view to analysing what technologies needed to be prioritised in response to the prevailing economic conditions. This was to further ensure the company wasn’t pushing technology “into an arena that wasn’t really ready for it. Rather, it was to understand what the market requirements were and then build a case for putting it in place.” He says that, as technology strategy manager, his brief was to look at trends and identify business cases while structuring opportunities for the application of the emerging technical <mark>innovation</mark>s he understands so well.</P><P>Having spent “30-plus years in the industry”, Jones spent his early career working in areas such as centralised planning and design standards at a time when the market was dominated by fossil fuels and nuclear power. “But in the past decade, there’s been this gradual change that started with wind power,” which he describes as originally being a ‘contained’ market event. Yet, as the reduction in the price of renewables had an impact on the network, it presented a challenge to the traditional areas of centralised generation, transmission and distribution. “Looking at today’s network, we are seeing a higher penetration of renewables, while advances in technology are challenging the topology of these networks. Which means that people like me are now faced with how we are going to deal with this.”</P><P>The big questions on everyone’s lips are: “How are we going to deal with power flows going in the wrong direction? How are we going to deal with generation being in the wrong location? How are we going to deal with demand that isn’t in the right place? How are we going to deal with a lack of centralised generation?” Jones sums up the position by explaining that once “there would have been a great big power station with a couple of power lines and people taking what they were given. Now we have a situation that is much more dynamic. We also have a situation where third parties are starting to come into the mix as well, and that is really quite exciting.” In the power game, he says, new players are slowly displacing the traditional players “who are looking to deliver new business models. To say this is a challenge is to understate the position, because the technology involved is considerable.”</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blockquote""><P>‘‘Alternative’ energy has gone beyond a societal wish. It now makes economic sense to look at decentralisation and distributed energy.’</P><FOOTER class=""blockquote-footer"">Peter Jones, technology strategy manager, <mark>ABB</mark></FOOTER></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Jones says the uptake in renewables was ‘obviously’ driven by the <mark>climate</mark> agenda, while admitting that his personal view is that “nobody really thought that it would take off to the extent that it has done”. Neither does he think we predicted adequately just how readily society would accept renewable energy. But “what people really underestimated was the price drop in the technology”. He refers to the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO), the government’s primary instruments of renewable energy policy, in which emerging forms of energy supply were labelled ‘alternative’: a landscape that was regarded as either fringe or ‘nice’. Yet gradually, factors related to the decentralisation of generation “mean that renewables has gathered its own momentum, particularly with PV”.</P><P>While outliers of the movement were either visionaries or those simply on the lookout for subsidies, there was a middle ground of suppliers with a desire to provide an economically viable source of renewable energy that could contribute in a significant way to the national power mix.</P><P>In cases such as this, Jones says you’ve got to look at what is the main driver. While it is tempting to think the desire to appear ‘green’ was a strong candidate, “the main driver was the cost. In the early years, this was clearly subsidy-driven with a lot of emphasis on <mark>climate change</mark>.” Yet in the UK, “we took the approach that we would enable society’s wishes while fundamentally observing the real issue, which was cost. Our regulator has put a lot in place to enable low <mark>carbon</mark>, but it is primarily about cost. If you can put forward a solution that has <mark>carbon</mark> saving within it – which is difficult to put a value on – there is still always the question of the deliverable cost-saving to the customer.”</P><P>Today, says Jones, ‘alternative’ energy is self-sustaining, and “it can’t be stopped. This is because it has gone beyond a societal wish. It now makes economic sense to look at decentralisation and distributed energy.” The consensus in the market, he says, is that distributed energy will probably come in at a lower cost. “It is this cost argument now, rather than green credentials, that is a much more solid way of bringing this transition from centralised to distributed power into place. The early governmental subsidies for renewables were very brave. But they were always there to prime the pump for a future of distributed energy resource.”</P><P>Jones says that as a force in the power generation, transmission and distribution market, <mark>ABB</mark> provides technology to the industry “whichever way it goes”.</P><P>He means that as technologists, the company follows the market. “If it was for centralised generation and long-distance transmission, then <mark>ABB</mark> has that portfolio. If the market was for decentralised digitalisation and high levels of control ‘behind the meter’, then we have that too.</P><P>“We have the technology, but our brief is to look at what the drivers are. What we are seeing globally is that the trends are the same as in the UK,” which is a move away from large centralised generation plant that the industry is starting to view as ‘not bankable’. This implication that it makes more financial sense to work on a distributed basis can be seen “practically everywhere,” says Jones. It’s not so much that centralisation is “yesterday thinking”, as he carefully points out. “I would say that the market economics of big investments in centralised plants are less attractive in the current <mark>climate</mark>.”</P><P>At the same time, the economics of decentralisation are becoming more attractive. “At one time it was simply not thought feasible that it would be better to provide energy locally. It was always felt that the best way was to apply to a utility to get a connection. Yet now people are responding to a market pull, driven by a growing interest in available technology. They are looking to combine technologies and optimise use.”</P><P>As an example, Jones cites the Cheshire Energy Hub: “a group of customers that produces power and consumes large amounts of it”. One of its members is Peel, which has developed a 51MW onshore wind farm and through its Protos development, a 21MW biomass plant “right next to a science park. What Peel has asked is, if they were to optimise their resources locally, would that be a lower-cost solution than connecting to a traditional network?”</P><P>What’s important about this example, says Jones, is that “there are a number of people starting to think like that”. He says that where <mark>ABB</mark> comes in to a discussion like this, it isn’t to help them run the figures, but to deliver the appropriate technology to see the project through. “We can monitor and control a CHP plant and we can monitor, measure and control a biomass plant and collectively look right over the top of all this (because we have the software systems to do so), and provide data for the best solution.</P><P>“We’re speaking to customers asking us to tell them about micro-grids,” essentially investigating the feasibility of “operating as an island, only calling on the grid network when we need it. Is it possible to mix gas and electricity to reduce our energy costs? There are also third-party financial institutions looking into whether they can provide capacity into large cities.” What this means for Jones is that there are clients “asking us to show that this technology exists”.</P><P>However, it has to work financially. “The main thing about centralised power generation in the past was that it was well-​proved that economies of scale were a huge factor. Yet it was never considered that a localised approach may be cost-effective too, while also allowing for the accommodation of more renewables.” Of course, it is more complex than that, because, as Jones says, “there are many, many strands running in parallel here. There are the economies of digitisation, which now make it possible to control and monitor so many pieces of equipment.” There is also the consideration that while it is possible for centralised generation providers to accommodate renewables – and Jones states that there are providers doing a good job in this area – “there are also those that have hit the limit. For example, centralised systems in the south-west with high inclusion of PV are experiencing big constraints. During the peak in summer, there’s a large amount of power trying to flow back up transmission systems that were never designed to take that sort of flow.”</P><P>What this means is that decentralisation, with optimised digitisation and control, allows for better movement of power into areas “where it could be used, which in turn would allow you to put more renewables on the network. You get a double win: if you’re using more renewables, then you’re simply getting more from renewables. But you’re also avoiding a large amount of network reinforcement costs.”</P><P>With distributed energy, “what we are starting to see are multi-stranded benefits. It’s not straightforward or simple, but it is starting to appear.” Jones then cites the case of China – “which we think of as having large centralised coal-fired plants with large renewables up in the mountains” – that is committed to high PV and wind targets. “Because these targets are eye-wateringly high, they cannot absorb all of that renewable power into their transmission system because they can’t shift it about, and they too are running into problems. So they have a two-stranded approach. First, you put as much as you economically can onto the general system, while then having local distribution accommodated within the network. When you start talking about accommodating large amounts of renewable energy cost-effectively on a network, you’re talking distribution level, where the economics start to swing in your favour.”</P><P>What this example shows, says Jones, is that distributed energy resource isn’t just driven by the British market or the green agenda, but by engineering principles, which are, in a nutshell: “If you can’t use it, try and get it to where it’s going to be used. If you can’t use it at the right time, look to see if you can find a technology that will allow you to manage that. That’s what we are seeing globally, it’s what the market is telling us locally, and we’re seeing customer groups that are coming to us asking us if there is another way.” This ‘other way’ finds itself in that Brave New World, aligned to a cusp of technology change driven by market economic forces and, to an extent, green values targets.</P><P>What’s going to happen next? “From what I can see, the future is not going to follow the rules. There are an awful lot of network assets out there and they are not easy to change because of the money involved. So we are finding ourselves constrained by them. However, market pull is really testing this situation by demanding <mark>innovation</mark>. It’s extremely early days. Yet who would have thought that changes we have seen in other technological spheres would have happened?”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></ARTICLE></BODY></HTML>"

                        The historical Paris Agreement was adopted in December 2015 by as many as 196 States, parties to the UNFCCC. It aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of <mark>climate change</mark> by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. In October 2016, after a very swift process, the accord cleared the final threshold of 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions required for it to enter into force. Both developed and developing countries shall commit to ambitious emissions reductions, while the UNFCCC defines the rules of implementation and establishes a viable plan to provide financial support to developing countries to support <mark>climate</mark> action. International scientific, technological and financial co-operation is viewed as an element of crucial importance. How are global corporations, institutional players and first-tier research institutions reacting to the new, global challenges in the energy sector? At this event, global stakeholders will present their visions and strategies, which will then be challenged by ETH faculty members and researchers. This will be followed by an open panel discussion, where the audience will have the possibility to challenge the panelists.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion-media""><H3 class=""accordionHeader"" tabindex=""-1"">Media</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

	</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>If renewable energy is ever to account for a large part of the total energy supply, countries will need to install new, large-scale transmission grids, both to get power to cities from remote areas such as deserts that often have the best renewable resources, and to combine power from widely distributed wind turbines and solar panels, which can help average out fluctuations in their output. In Europe, there’s been talk for years of a supergrid that would pull together power from hydroelectric dams in Scandinavia with wind farms in Germany and large solar farms in Spain and even North Africa (see “<A href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/405558/a-supergrid-for-europe/"">A Supergrid for Europe</A>”).</P><P>But such a supergrid has faced serious technical hurdles. The transmission lines that make up conventional power grids use alternating current (AC), which loses large amounts of power over long distances unless complicated and expensive measures are taken. DC is more efficient over long distances, and it offers the additional benefit of working well underground and underwater, reducing or eliminating the need for the unsightly transmission towers that can make it difficult to site new transmission lines.</P><P>DC lines have long been used to transmit power across the North Sea, and from large hydroelectric dams to cities. But until <mark>ABB</mark>’s advance, it wasn’t safe to connect DC lines into a large-scale grid.</P><P><mark>ABB</mark>’s circuit breaker changes that. Within five milliseconds it can stop the flow of a huge amount of power—equal to the entire output of a nuclear power plant, <mark>ABB</mark> says. The breakers could be used to nearly instantaneously reroute power in a DC grid around a problem, allowing the grid to keep functioning. “Ordinarily, if something goes wrong anywhere, all the power goes off,” says Claes Rytoft, <mark>ABB</mark>’s chief technology officer. “The breaker can cut out the faulty line and keep the rest healthy.”</P><P>Researchers have been trying to develop high-voltage DC circuit breakers for a century (see “<A href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/427504/edisons-revenge-the-rise-of-dc-power/"">Edison’s Revenge: The Rise of DC Power</A>”). Mechanical switches alone didn’t work—they shut off power too slowly. Power electronics made of transistors that can switch on and off large amounts of power offered a possible solution, but they proved far too inefficient. <mark>ABB</mark>’s solution combines power electronics with a mechanical switch to create a hybrid system that’s both fast and efficient. The new circuit breaker could also be far less expensive than systems that use only transistors.</P><P>“The cost of the power electronics breaker was humongous,” says Ram Adapa, a power delivery technical leader at the Electric Power Research Institute. “The hybrid breaker should be less costly.”</P><P>With the major hurdle to DC grids out of the way, <mark>ABB</mark> is now developing algorithms to control them. The system will still need to work in concert with AC lines for distributing the power in local communities, since there is no inexpensive DC equivalent of the transformers needed to step down power to the relatively low voltages used in homes and businesses. One of the first markets for the new technology could be Germany, which has decided to turn off its nuclear power plants and rely heavily on renewable energy (see “<A href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/428145/the-great-german-energy-experiment/"">The Great German Energy Experiment</A>”).</P><P>The degree to which high-voltage DC grids can help renewables may depend on the economics of installing underground cables versus overhead lines. Obtaining rights-of-way is one of the biggest obstacles to installing new transmission lines in many countries, and underground installations don’t require obtaining new rights-of-way, since they can be easily installed along existing roadways. <mark>ABB</mark> says that when the entire system cost is taken into account, underground installations are only slightly more expensive than overhead ones. But Adapa is skeptical, saying that underground installations could cost five times as much.</P><DIV class=""callout--tagged-event-promo"" desc=""in-story-promo-mittr-subscribe""><P class=""callout__copy"">Meet the Experts in AI, Robotics and the Economy at EmTech Next.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

Solving a problem that has handicapped use of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) in transmission lines, networks, and power grids for more than 100 years, multinational power engineering giant <mark>ABB</mark> has announced that it has designed and developed a hybrid DC breaker capable of interrupting DC power flows “equivalent to the output of a nuclear power station within five milliseconds… as fast as a honeybee takes per flap of its wings.”</P><P>The hybrid DC breaker combines “advanced ultrafast mechanical actuators with <mark>ABB</mark>’s in-house semiconductor IGBT valve technologies or power electronics.” <mark>ABB</mark> management deems it a “game changer.”</P><P>Capable of carrying electricity over long distances much more efficiently than alternating current (AC), HVDC transmission is seen as a way of transporting renewable energy from remote utility-scale locations — such as desert solar power facilities and offshore wind farms — to consumption centers at much lower cost than existing transmission infrastructure.</P><P> </P><P> </P><H2>Stopping HVDC Flows Faster than the Blink of an Eye</H2><P>According to <mark>ABB</mark>, the breakthrough hybrid DC breaker “removes a significant stumbling block in the development of HVDC transmission grids where planning can start now. These grids will enable interconnection and load balancing between HVDC power superhighways integrating renewables and transporting bulk power across long distances with minimal losses,” technology manager for grid systems and HVDC grids program manager Magnus Callavik writes in a Nov. 7 post on the <A href=""http://www.<mark>abb</mark>-conversations.com/2012/11/<mark>abb</mark>-achieves-another-milestone-in-electrical-engineering"" target=""_blank""><mark>ABB</mark> Conversations blog</A>.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“DC grids will enable sharing of resources like lines and converter stations that provides reliability and redundancy in a power network in an economically viable manner with minimal losses. <mark>ABB</mark>’s new Hybrid HVDC breaker, in simple terms will enable the transmission system to maintain power flow even if there is a fault on one of the lines.” [<EM>sic</EM>]</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><mark>ABB</mark>’s hybrid circuit breaker is capable of blocking and breaking DC currents at thousands of amperes and several hundred thousands of volts, equivalent to the average power consumption of 1 million Europeans.</P><P>“It amounts to stopping power capable of feeding a large city much faster than an eye blink!,” <mark>ABB</mark> elaborates. “This speed helps protect the DC transmission system and prevent power outages in new low loss compact power superhighways. The next step is to install the breaker in pilot installations.”</P><H2>Edison and GE May Have Lost the Battle of the Currents…</H2><P>Promoted and developed by Nikola Tesla and Westinghouse, alternating current (AC) in the early 20th century won the so-called “<A href=""http://www.<mark>abb</mark>.com/cawp/seitp202/c646c16ae1512f8ec1257934004fa545.aspx"" target=""_blank"">War of the Currents</A>” versus DC, which was promoted and sponsored by Thomas Edison and General Electric. AC has since become the predominant form of electric current used in transmission lines, grids, buildings, and homes.</P><P>There are advantages to using DC at local and much smaller scales, however, according to <mark>ABB</mark>. DC is still used to distribute electricity — particularly in remote and isolated communities — and numerous and varied equipment and devices produce as well as run on DC (including batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines on the production side; and computers, cell phones, and LED lights on the consumption side), <mark>ABB</mark> notes in “Tesla vs Edison: the war of currents.”</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“At the moment, each of these appliances uses its own rectifier to switch power from AC to DC. A much more efficient solution would be to convert the power in a larger rectifier as it enters each building. <mark>ABB</mark> estimates the savings from using DC instead of AC in buildings could be in the order of 10 to 20 percent. Losses could be further reduced by converting power to DC at the substation level and distributing DC power throughout an entire district, or even by transmitting, distributing and using power as DC.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Building out DC distribution grids where AC counterparts already exist would be impractical, <mark>ABB</mark> acknowledges, but it sees DC as a “solution of choice” in newly built areas or cities, as well as for communities and installations that are off the grid at present. “Such islands include new ships and communities generating their own power from renewable resources,” <mark>ABB</mark> says.</P><P>Furthermore, <mark>ABB</mark> points out, “DC distribution would be particularly attractive for communities using power generated by photovoltaic solar panels, since this is already DC power and currently has to be converted to AC before distribution.”</P></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The firm predicts a $20 billion spending surge in smart technologies in the next ten years, led by electric utilities and global grid giants like <mark>ABB</mark>, who are ready to cash in on the power revolution.</P><P>The <A href=""http://www.luxresearchinc.com/images/stories/brochures/Press_Releases/RELEASE_Smart_Grid_1_26_11.pdf"">January report</A> finds that the new digital grid networks will pump out 900 percent more data to electric utility companies by 2020, as they install millions of smart meters, the in-home devices that report energy usage.</P><P>To handle the data explosion, utility companies and industrial power firms are expected to nearly triple the current $12.8 billion smart grid market to $34.2 billion by investing in the distribution hardware, management software and information technology (IT) needed.</P><P>Nearly 75 percent of that money will come from utilities updating their grids to make way for the smart grid revolution, Steve Minnihan, a Lux Research analyst and the lead author of the report, told Solve<mark>Climate</mark> News.</P><P><STRONG>Smart Grids: 'Absolutely Essential' for Clean Power</STRONG></P><P>&quot;Smart grids are absolutely essential to the widespread adoption of solar and wind energy,&quot; Minnihan said.</P><P>On a traditional electrical grid, the intermittent flows from wind farms or solar plants can sag or surge. To compensate, fossil fuel-powered energy then ticks up or down. But the movements are not adequately controlled and can lead to costly stoppages, energy leaks and overwhelming voltage levels.</P><P>The global expansion of smart grids means that renewable energy sources could increasingly hop onto a system that tracks energy flows in real-time and responds immediately to digital commands, thus taking much of the risk out of going green.</P><P>With a more efficient connection, more clean energy could reach consumers rather than get held up on an outdated grid.</P><P>Shihab Kuran, president and CEO of New Jersey-based <A href=""http://www.petrasolar.com/"">Petra Solar</A>, said: &quot;Seventy percent more solar energy could be implemented if you incorporate smart grid features. In order for solar to be successful, you really need smart grid to go there.&quot;</P><P>Speaking at a January <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/events/live/networked-solar/"">solar-smart grid conference</A> in New Jersey hosted by <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/"" target=""_blank"">Greentech Media</A>, he said that the clean technology company itself was investing in smart grids.</P><P>Since its start in 2006, Petra Solar has won around $6 million in grants from the <A href=""http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/segis.html"" target=""_blank"">Solar Energy Grid Integration System</A> (SEGIS) program by the U.S. Department of Energy to study how solar penetration affects electrical grids. The firm then went on to build its SunWave module, which features a solar panel and microinverter that attach to power poles to create a smart grid network in half an hour's time, Kuran said.</P><P>&quot;You have to think about reliability first, and solar production second,&quot; Kuran said.</P><P><STRONG>Industrial Giants, Led by <mark>ABB</mark>, Prepare for Surge</STRONG></P><P>Global manufacturing giants are already prepping themselves for the spending surge on smart grid technologies that is being spurred by utilities.</P><P>Companies like <A href=""http://www.<mark>abb</mark>.com/""><mark>ABB</mark></A>, <A href=""http://www.siemens.com/"">Siemens AG</A> and <A href=""http://www.gepower.com/"">General Electric (GE)</A>, which provide myriad services to power utility companies, are n<mark>abb</mark>ing leading telecommunications and IT firms to bolster their data-processing portfolios, hoping to secure their piece of the $34.2 billion pie.</P><P>&quot;It is a very strong move for them because it is a natural progression,&quot; Minnihan said.</P><P>He continued: &quot;The electricity industry is conservative and very slow to adopt new technologies, so if utilities have worked with a company in the past, they are more likely to adopt new smart grid technologies if they are being brought to them by a company that they already have a relationship with.&quot;</P><P>Switzerland-based <mark>ABB</mark> has led the charge. The firm provides electrical equipment at power plants and utility grids in more than 100 countries and made $32 billion in revenues in 2009.</P><P>Last May, the company spent $1 billion to acquire Atlanta-based <A href=""http://www.ventyx.com/"">Ventyx</A>, a major software, data and advisory services provider for utilities and smart grid markets. In December and January, <mark>ABB</mark> added <A href=""http://www.insertkey.com/"" target=""_blank"">Insert Key Solutions</A> (IKS) of Pennsylvania and <A href=""http://www.obvient.com/"" target=""_blank"">Obvient Strategies Inc.</A> of Georgia, both privately owned specialist software providers, to its Ventyx portfolio for undisclosed amounts.</P><P>Connecticut-based GE Energy, whose parent company made $38 billion in 2010 revenues, has gone on a spree of its own.</P><P>Last fall, it acquired large smart grid software companies <A href=""http://www.opalsoftware.com.au/"" target=""_blank"">Opal Software</A> of Australia and <A href=""http://www.snclavalin.com/ecs/en/indexen.htm"" target=""_blank"">SNC-Lavalin's Energy Control Systems</A> of Montreal for undisclosed amounts. Earlier this year, the corporation acquired Remote Energy Monitoring, a software and hardware firm in Australia and the U.K. that helps households and utilities to more efficiently manage energy usage.</P><P>German energy behemoth <A href=""http://www.siemens.com/"" target=""_blank"">Siemens</A> has similar ambitions in mind. Early last year, the company said its goal is to receive orders worth more than €6 billion, or $8.3 billion, for smart grids by 2015. The company made $38 billion in sales on energy-conserving electricity grids, wind power and solar energy last year.</P><P>&quot;The Smart Grid market will see increasingly dynamic growth fueled by <mark>climate change</mark> and economic stimulus programs. We want to grow twice as fast as the overall market,&quot; said Wolfgang Dehen, CEO of the Siemens Energy Sector, <A href=""http://www.siemens.com/press/en/pressrelease/?press=/en/pressrelease/2009/corporate_communication/axx20090981.htm"">in a press release</A>.</P><P>&quot;The world needs intelligent power grids in order to meet the growing demand for energy in a way that is eco-friendly and reliable. We estimate that the demand for electricity will double by 2030, due to trends like <A href=""http://www.energy.siemens.com/us/en/power-distribution/e-mobility.htm"">e-mobility</A>, which is just emerging,&quot; he said.</P><P>Lux Research's Minnihan said that leading networking firms like <A href=""http://www.cisco.com/""> Cisco Systems Inc.</A>, <A href=""http://www.ibm.com/"">IBM</A> and <A href=""http://www.intel.com/"">Intel</A>, plus mid-sized startups such as <A href=""http://www.silverspringnet.com/"">Silver Spring Networks</A> of Redwood City, Calif., are also gearing up to capitalize on rising demand from utilities and governments.</P><P>&quot;This is the next big market explosion for the electricity industry.

The fact that energy efficiency is the thread that runs through all of <mark>ABB</mark>’s planning makes the company a strong fighter against <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“Our crown jewels in this are our frequency converters, which were developed in Vaasa and which reduced <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions by about 340 million tonnes in 2014 worldwide. The energy they saved corresponds to the consumption of 110 million residences,” says Juha Muhonen, <mark>ABB</mark> Finland’s Sales Director in Rail and Wind.</P><DIV id=""attachment_189"" style=""max-width: 279px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">“With their energy efficiency and innovative solutions for utilising renewable energy sources, <mark>ABB</mark>’s technologies support the building of a <mark>sustainable</mark> world,” Juha Muhonen says.</P></DIV><P><mark>ABB</mark>’s technologies support energy production that is based on renewable energy sources, which the EU aims to increase to 50% by 2050. Already wind, biomass, solar and hydropower are growing rapidly and replacing coal more and more. Energy is mainly still produced in large units, and the cash flow runs from the consumer to the producer. However, decentralised energy production will change this pattern: when a lot of the energy in a network is supplied by small producers, both energy and cash flows will run in both directions.
“<mark>ABB</mark> has a great solution for this and it is smart grids. Fluctuating demand requires smart electric current to ensure a stable energy supply,” Muhonen explains.</P><P><mark>ABB</mark> is currently developing solutions for storing the extra electricity obtained from renewable energy sources; it is working on electric banks of accumulators for various needs. It has made the most progress with charging devices for electric cars and buses.
“For marine use, we have a hybrid ship in the pipeline that could carry batteries along at sea. The ship would be charged with shore-side electricity in the port, which would reduce its noise <mark>pollution</mark> and emissions,” says Muhonen.</P><P>In Finland, for example, one fifth of all the energy consumed is expended by transport of all kinds. Fortunately, <mark>ABB</mark>’s solutions can help to make transport more environmentally friendly.
“<mark>ABB</mark>’s Azipod® electric propulsion and energy management system, for example, reduces a vessel’s energy consumption by up to 20% and cuts <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions significantly,” Muhonen says. The energy consumption of trains can also be cut by up to 30% when their braking energy is converted into electricity to be utilised by the train.</P><DIV id=""attachment_190"" style=""max-width: 451px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Energy efficiency is the thread that runs through all of <mark>ABB</mark> planning.

The consumption of electricity by industrial electric motors worldwide, currently 28%, could also be reduced significantly. Furthermore, there is enough renewable energy available to be utilised multifold, if increasing its use was not so slow. In Muhonen’s view, the crucial point is the development of battery technology, which will further advance a <mark>sustainable</mark> world.
“We must conserve some natural resources for future generations. Because nations are procreating at a fast rate, we have to follow the principles of <mark>sustainable</mark> development when designing and planning products and solutions.

      city of Davos and <mark>ABB</mark> have teamed up in a long-term partnership to 
      provide e-infrastructure for public and private transportation.
    </P><P>
      Davos residents and WEF guests can experience the pioneering TOSA bus 
      for themselves. The award-winning TOSA bus, developed by <mark>ABB</mark> in 
      Switzerland, is already in use in Geneva and will soon be implemented in 
      the French city of Nantes. It can recharge its battery in just 20 
      seconds as passengers board and disembark. In Davos, it will operate on 
      the busy Line 1, running from the tourist center to the hospital. This 
      is the first time TOSA technology is being used in an Alpine region. The 
      idea is to run the system under extreme winter weather conditions; <mark>ABB</mark> 
      and its project partners expect to gain valuable insights from this 
      pilot project.
    </P><P>
      In addition, electric cars transporting attendees around Davos will be 
      able to recharge their batteries at eight newly installed <mark>ABB</mark> 
      fast-charging stations.
    </P><P>
      Collectively, the TOSA e-bus and the charging stations provide a 
      powerful, real-world demonstration of state-of-the-art <mark>sustainable</mark> 
      transportation technologies, which are seeing increased deployment 
      throughout the world as e-mobility becomes the driving force for 
      bringing energy efficiency with low environmental impact to cars, buses, 
      trains, ships and cable cars.
    </P><P>
      “The shift to electric vehicles is no longer a question of if, but 
      rather of when and how quickly,” said <mark>ABB</mark> CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer. “EVs 
      are becoming increasingly attractive to motorists. As well as being 
      ecologically responsible, they're becoming less expensive to buy and 
      maintain.”
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> is the technology leader in the fast-charging products and systems 
      that are transforming transportation in globally <mark>sustainable</mark> ways. 
      <mark>Sustainable</mark> transportation is playing a crucial role in the fight 
      against <mark>climate change</mark>, as e-mobility begins to replace 
      fossil-fuel-powered vehicles spewing greenhouse gases contributing to 
      global warming.
    </P><P><B>Fast-charging at the World Economic Forum meeting</B></P><P>
      For e-cars, <mark>ABB</mark> is already the global leader in fast charging, with more 
      than 6,000 stations installed in more than 50 countries. At Davos, world 
      leaders will get to see the eight recently installed <mark>ABB</mark> Terra 53 
      charging stations in action. The <mark>ABB</mark> Terra 53 is the best-selling 50 kW 
      DC charging station in Europe and North America, supporting the CCS, 
      CHAdeMO and simultaneous 43 kW AC charging standards.
    </P><P>
      For public transport, the all-electric TOSA e-bus at Davos is at the 
      cutting edge of <mark>sustainable</mark> transportation <mark>innovation</mark>. Indeed, TOSA 
      received the prestigious Watt d’Or 2018 in the energy efficient mobility 
      category from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy. The TOSA technology 
      was jointly developed in Switzerland by <mark>ABB</mark> in partnership with 
      Transport Publics Genevois (tpg), the Office de Promotion of Industries 
      et des Technologies (OPI), the Services Industriels de Genève (SIG), and 
      bus manufacturer Carrosserie HESS.
    </P><P>
      The same TOSA technology in use at Davos has been powering buses on 
      Geneva's bus line 23 airport route. They use overhead contacts that 
      connect at selected stops along their routes to replenish their 
      batteries in as little as 20 seconds, recharging as passengers board and 
      exit. The environmentally friendly system in Geneva could ultimately cut 
      <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions by 1,000 tons annually.
    </P><P>
      But <mark>ABB</mark>’s <mark>sustainable</mark> transportation solutions aren't limited to 
      conventional cars and buses.
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> supplies the railway sector with innovative and energy-efficient 
      technologies like traction transformer and converter made primarily in 
      Switzerland. One example is the Rhaetian Railway that shuttles between 
      Landquart and Davos.
    </P><P>
      In the racing world, through its recently announced partnership with the 
      Formula E electric-car racing organization, <mark>ABB</mark> will help to refine the 
      design and functionality of electric vehicles and infrastructure as well 
      as associated digital platforms.
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> is also enabling e-mobility in ocean-going tankers, freighters and 
      passenger ships. There, <mark>ABB</mark>’s <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnew.<mark>abb</mark>.com%2Fmarine%2Fsystems-and-solutions%2Felectric-propulsion%2Fazipod&amp;esheet=51746724&amp;newsitemid=20180122006126&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Azipod&amp;index=1&amp;md5=91ef11b58ad0e903731583e9b679b482"" rel=""nofollow"">Azipod</A> 
      propulsion systems power vessels with steerable, high-efficiency 
      electric-drive propellers, which make ships significantly more 
      maneuverable and can reduce their need for on-board fossil fuels by 40 
      percent or more.
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> is also taking e-mobility to new heights in cable cars. <mark>ABB</mark> motors 
      power the steepest funicular cable railway in the world, which opened in 
      the Swiss Alpine village of Stoos in December 2017. The <mark>ABB</mark> motors, 
      which deliver a total output of 2.3 megawatts, enable the cable railway 
      to carry up to 1,500 people per hour in each direction over its 1.7 
      kilometer route. <mark>ABB</mark> has also provided state-of-the-art motors and 
      drives for a newly opened, record-setting gondola system carrying 580 
      passengers an hour to the Zugspitze — Germany's highest peak.
    </P><P><B><mark>ABB</mark></B> (<mark>ABB</mark>N: SIX Swiss Ex) is a pioneering technology leader in 
      electrification products, robotics and motion, industrial automation and 
      power grids, serving customers in utilities, industry and transport &amp;

Before joining <mark>ABB</mark> in 2010, Markus earned an Engineering degree with a focus on Energy Technology, worked for the Japanese multinational conglomerate company Hitachi, and held several international management positions in marketing, sales and business development.

Today, we are the world leader in microgrids technology. Our main goal is to integrate more renewables into grids across the globe, thus being a main actor in driving the energy transition forward. We are continually working on lowering the <mark>carbon</mark> intensity across all our services and all our current implementations of the microgrid technology save fossil fuels every day.</P><P name=""bffc"" id=""bffc"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">Why are microgrids of crucial importance?</STRONG></P><P name=""1785"" id=""1785"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We’re currently witnessing a global trend in full swing, which is the rapid growth of renewables. This trend is driven by price reductions and the more decentralised nature of renewables. In both mature and emerging markets, renewables have taken leadership for the investment in power generation. The microgrid technology is the natural development to keep this trend growing, and to integrate more renewables into our power supply on and off grid. Renewables also have a different interaction with the grid and the consumer; this interaction needs to be managed as intelligently as possible, which modern microgrids do while improving system reliability.</P><P name=""1afc"" id=""1afc"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">What are the main advantages of microgrids?</STRONG></P><P name=""ca76"" id=""ca76"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Microgrids are like smaller versions of the national electricity grid running independently. They are a complement to the centralised transmission grid system, which has quite a lot of drawbacks (energy loss, high investment cost, disturbances for users, etc.). The microgrid technology address all these issues, especially for communities and regions that have adequate renewable energy resources.</P><P name=""63ba"" id=""63ba"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Microgrids also have much smaller financial commitments, they use renewable energy resources, hence are more environmentally friendly with lower <mark>carbon</mark> footprints; they are also isolated from any grid disturbance or outage and require fewer technical skills (as large scale power plants) to operate as they rely more on automation.</P><P name=""30f2"" id=""30f2"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Microgrids thus enhance the grid resilience and stability and contribute to the energy security by controlling its distributed energy resources. Operating in either grid-connected or islanded mode, microgrids have the ability to integrate and dispatch these resources, which include renewable generation, fossil fuel generation and storage, and finally manage loads.</P></DIV><DIV class=""section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn""><P name=""fc55"" id=""fc55"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--figure""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">On the other side, what would you say are the biggest challenges facing the uptake of microgrids worldwide?</STRONG></P><P name=""1b5d"" id=""1b5d"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">What’s not a problem is the technology. Indeed, it has been here for many years, and has now reached a mature status. Our main challenge today is to convince customers and stakeholders to accept new roles and responsibilities. In every area of business, it is always a challenge to adapt traditional commercial and technical concepts, but this is also what makes this work interesting. We’re pioneers.</P><P name=""3df1"" id=""3df1"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">With the integration of microgrids, existing players that have always had central power lose some of that control. There is a shift in responsibilities. A large energy customer can, for instance, implement his own microgrid and produce a lot of his energy, instead of buying it from his utility. But what happens when this customer doesn’t want to maintain his microgrid? Could the utility provider make new revenue by maintaining the microgrid, and providing high-quality grid stability? These questions are still unanswered, although we are already seeing the emergence of multiple business models, which is exciting.</P><P name=""1017"" id=""1017"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">As for any new technology, we must create trust in the concept. As described, microgrids go along with a shift in responsibilities and loss of centralised control. Not all influential stakeholders in the electricity system are happy with that shift. And regulators responsible for system stability need to be further convinced that decentralised power generation will guarantee and even improve grid stability. Let’s not forget that with any change, always comes resistance.</P><P name=""19bf"" id=""19bf"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">How are microgrid revolutionizing the energy structure in emerging countries?</STRONG></P><P name=""35ff"" id=""35ff"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">In an emerging market with growing population and electricity demand, microgrids provide reliable power supply, starting from small energy systems and finally supporting the bulk of the electric system. The implementation time of microgrids is much faster and cheaper than fossil fuel based power plants and large infrastructure. To give you a rough idea, it takes around six months to get a microgrid generating electricity online and a realistic timeframe for coal plants is between 5 to 10 years.</P><P name=""d88b"" id=""d88b"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Microgrids are best known for delivering electricity to communities or industrial operations in remote or inaccessible areas where it is too costly or difficult to provide a grid connection. However, grid-connected microgrids are now taking on a new role in developed areas of the world to ensure continuity of supply in the event of potential grid faults and emergencies. The ability of microgrids to seamlessly separate and isolate themselves from the main grid when needed is an increasingly important feature.</P><P name=""18fe"" id=""18fe"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">As a disruptive invention, have you ever faced any resistance from mainstream grid suppliers and governments when it comes to introducing microgrids to markets across the globe?</STRONG></P><P name=""63dc"" id=""63dc"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We had in the past, but it is becoming better. Years ago, grid suppliers and utilities were hesitant because the magnitude of implementation of renewables and batteries were not so clear. Today, distribution system operators are a lot more open to the concept of microgrids. They are responsible for providing grid stability, and they face a lot of integration of renewable energy — starting from house — holds up to utility scale projects — so they are familiar with the realities of a changing grid.</P><P name=""d283"" id=""d283"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">In fact, whoever is responsible for the system stability has now started to see distributed generation and microgrids as a reliable option.</P><P name=""9c59"" id=""9c59"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">Tell us about <mark>ABB</mark> successes in transforming the energy systems abroad?</STRONG></P><P name=""b2c0"" id=""b2c0"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We have over 40 references globally with a wide spread of applications, from industry applications to powering harbours. Let me give you a few examples. As far as industrial applications are concerned, we have delivered a microgrid to support a factory in South Africa with handling of critical loads that also stabilises the grid connection, integrating renewable energy and batteries. This has reduced the downtime of the factory as well as the usage of diesel generation, resulting in a lot of savings for the customer. We are currently commissioning a similar project for the Red Cross to support their logistic centre in Tanzania.</P><P name=""1335"" id=""1335"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Another recent project we have done was to build several microgrid solutions that ensure high penetration of photovoltaics into the energy systems of mines in very off-grid locations. Those microgrids ensure grid stability and cost reduction from less usage fossil fuels.</P><P name=""b314"" id=""b314"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">In Aruba and Kodiak Island (Alaska), we have delivered solutions to increase the penetration of renewables and reduce the high cost of diesel for the local community. These projects were good examples of the application of microgrids powering remote communities.</P><P name=""50e7"" id=""50e7"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Amongst the other projects we are proud of is the implementation of microgrids on an oil and gas platform. This project will specifically be designed to provide a so-called spinning reserve and replace existing gas turbines.</P><P name=""24e2"" id=""24e2"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">All of those implemented microgrids drastically lower the usage of fossil fuels. It’s diffcult to give an exact number, as every implementation is different, but when you switch from an often diesel-powered scenario to a microgrid scenario with a diesel supplying just 15% of the energy during the year — you need a lot less fossil fuels.</P></DIV><DIV class=""section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn""><P name=""9f03"" id=""9f03"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--figure""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">In regard to these off-grid mining projects, can you tell us how renewable and storage technologies present an opportunity to improve the mine’s environmental footprint?</STRONG></P><P name=""0f69"" id=""0f69"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Mines in off-grid areas generate most of their power with diesel generators. Although the cost of diesel went down, the transportation costs to get the fuel to an off-grid location have remained the same. More and more mining companies are also looking into <mark>sustainable</mark> solutions to improve their environmental footprint.</P><P name=""301c"" id=""301c"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Mines are mainly located in areas with either good wind or photovoltaics conditions and often have little restrictions in regards of available space. With the drop in CAPEX of renewables, the cost of electricity produced by wind or photovoltaics can be significantly cheaper than any other energy source.</P><P name=""3b0d"" id=""3b0d"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">In order to use those renewable resources, <mark>ABB</mark>’s microgrid solutions (<mark>ABB</mark> PowerStoreTM) can enable a mine to often use as much as 100% renewable energy while ensuring grid stability and power quality.</P><P name=""33ce"" id=""33ce"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">According to your experience, what single change — technological, regulatory or otherwise — could further catalyse the industry?</STRONG></P><P name=""0391"" id=""0391"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">There are three very obvious catalysts. First of all, more regulatory certainty would increase the speed of growth, as more certainty usually improves the availability of financing. That’s a simple observation, but we can observe this in many projects. Any serious implementation of <mark>carbon</mark> pricing would also greatly benefit the integration of renewables and thus microgrids, that’s the second idea. Last but not least, battery prices are decreasing — any additional decrease multiplies that attractiveness of microgrids in many areas.</P><P name=""ca2f"" id=""ca2f"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">Talking about the future, where globally do you think will see the biggest expansion of microgrids in five years from now?</STRONG></P><P name=""aba4"" id=""aba4"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We look at this less in geographies, and more in applications that geographies can have in common. The largest growth will happen in remote communities, whether this is a town in Alaska or a village in Africa. This should be followed by established utilities pushing into microgrids to lower costs and retain customer access. Another very promising parametre we expect is the growth coming from commercial and industrial applications.</P><P name=""87cd"" id=""87cd"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">How optimistic are you about “plug and play” microgrid systems like the PowerStoreTM supporting the replacement of most of the fossil fuel-based capacity in off-grid locations like mining or island utilities in the future?</STRONG></P><P name=""402e"" id=""402e"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We are very optimistic about it. <mark>ABB</mark> has standardised and productised PowerStoreTM solutions to enable “plug and play” integration. These solutions are pre-designed and they are transportable on trucks to any place in the world. The intelligent control of the PowerStoreTM is also predefined for various application and works for both grid connected and off-grid systems.</P><P name=""75bd"" id=""75bd"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--figure""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">What are the main benefits of the different models of the PowerStoreTM system (Standalone, Hybrid, Station, Integrated)?</STRONG></P><P name=""98df"" id=""98df"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We have standardised different products for different applications so our range of products fulfil the market requirements that we have studied for many years. The Standalone is specifically built for larger sites like mining and in case battery manufacturers take a more visible role in the projects; the Hybrid system is most useful for the very small application in remote villages; and the Station and Integrated usually fit better for commercial and industrial applications.</P><P name=""7452"" id=""7452"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">What is your vision for the future of off-grid electricity?</STRONG></P><P name=""9609"" id=""9609"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">I hope that off-grid areas in emerging countries will leapfrog several steps in the <mark>sustainable</mark> development and directly embrace a multi-energy infrastructure and distributed generation.

One might think -- after years of focus on global warming -- that all the easy measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions had already been deployed. And yet, as governments engage in the 21st annual conference on <mark>climate change</mark> (COP21), some surprisingly low-hanging fruit remains.</P><P>
I don’t mean small fruit, either. I’m talking about big, high-yield fruit. Consider this: fitting energy-efficient electric motors on all pumps and fans with devices to regulate their speed would save 3,338 terawatt-hours, roughly equivalent to the amount of electrical energy produced in the EU in 2013.</P><P>
The opportunity is so huge because electric motors are among the biggest consumers of energy. They power all manner of equipment and account for about 40 percent of all electricity consumed worldwide. In the European Union, they are responsible for about 12 percent of total <mark>CO2</mark> emissions, second only to space-heating products.</P><P>
In recent years, the EU, along with several countries such as the United States and China, has imposed new rules requiring older, energy-hungry motors to be phased out. These rules, known as Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS), specify the minimum acceptable efficiency levels of a product, defining which products can be marketed and sold. Typically, these MEPS become more stringent over time. In the EU, for instance, rules requiring a higher efficiency class of motors came into effect in January 2015.</P><P>
MEPS in Europe and their equivalents in other countries will ultimately lead to the upgrading of the installed base of electric motors. However, at the current pace of implementation, and taking account of loopholes and enforcement issues, they will likely fall short of the energy savings needed to achieve <mark>climate</mark> goals, especially given that global energy consumption is expected to increase by 30 percent over the next 15 years.</P><P>
One reason is that MEPS specify the efficiency of individual products, in this case electric motors, rather than the efficiency of motor systems. No matter how efficient a motor is, if it cannot regulate its speed according to load, it will always be operating at full throttle. Legislation is gradually changing to take account of this -- for instance, EU rules that came into force in January 2015 specify that certain (less-efficient) motors must be able to adjust their speed. But only around 10 percent of motors in service worldwide are currently equipped with (variable-speed) drives that allow them to do this, even though the energy savings can be substantial -- up to 50 percent in some cases.</P><P>
Another challenge is to establish common MEPS globally. Again, progress is being made in this area, with more and more countries moving toward harmonized standards, but much remains to be done. A recent study commissioned by the European Commission concluded that if the most stringent current MEPS for product energy efficiency were harmonized today, overall global energy consumption would be 9 percent lower, and energy consumption due specifically to products would be 21 percent lower. This would save 8,950 terawatt-hours of electricity, equivalent to closing 165 coal-fired power plants, or taking 132 million cars off the road.</P><P>
The clock is ticking on <mark>climate change</mark>. The weight of scientific opinion is that we don’t have much more time to turn the tide on emissions; otherwise, it will not be possible to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which is considered the maximum temperature increase we can sustain without triggering potentially catastrophic <mark>climate</mark> events.</P><P>
Of all the actions that can and are being taken to limit <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and mitigate the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, none holds out more promise than improving energy efficiency. There are numerous measures that can be undertaken immediately, without fear of harming economic growth; indeed, since most investments in energy-efficient technology are paid back within a year or two through lower energy costs, they can significantly boost competitiveness, and through the replacement of old equipment, generate additional economic activity. Fruit doesn’t hang much lower than this.</P><P>

Care should be taken at St <mark>Abb</mark>'s Head as the cliffs can be exposed. Quiet road and countryside paths bring you back to the start.</P><P><STRONG>Why it's special </STRONG>The 90m cliffs at St <mark>Abb</mark>'s Head, formed millions of years ago by active volcanoes, are an area of outstanding beauty and an exhilarating vantage point from which to enjoy the magnificent seabird colony, including thousands of guillemots, razorbills, kittiwakes, fulmars, shags, puffins, shearwaters and skuas. If bird spotting isn't your thing, away from the cliffs, the grassland and freshwater lochs are rich in wildflowers and butterflies.</P><P><STRONG>Keep your eyes peeled for</STRONG>Gannets catching fish. They plunge to the sea from around 30m, hitting the water at up to 100km/h. The outward route culminates at St <mark>Abb</mark>'s Head Lighthouse, which was built by David and Thomas Stevenson (members of the renowned Stevenson family of lighthouse engineers) in 1862 and was automated in 1993.</P><P><STRONG>Recover afterwards</STRONG>Five miles south of St <mark>Abb</mark>'s lies the historic fishing village of Eyemouth, which is teeming with sweet and salty seaside delights. Try Giacopazzi's (<A href=""http://www.giacopazzis.co.uk"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">giacopazzis.co.uk</A>), a traditional chippie and ice-cream parlour that makes fresh ice-creams and sorbets on the premises.

Built in the 1750s for smuggler John Nisbet, it had special adaptations – including a secret tea chute – that allowed John and his brother David to smuggle in style for years.</P><P><STRONG>How to get there</STRONG>Limited bus service from Edinburgh to St <mark>Abb</mark>'s. Regular buses from Berwick-upon-Tweed.</P><H2>Step by step</H2><P><STRONG>1</STRONG> Exit the car park by an information board on to a path which descends past a visitor centre and runs parallel with the main road. At the end of the path turn left through a gate where the path continues through a little pocket of woodland and then begins to climb gradually along a cliff path around Starney Bay. Continue along the path by some dramatic rock structures and then walk along a grassy path down to Horsecastle Bay.</P><P><STRONG>2</STRONG> Once over a stile the path then begins to climb steeply away from Horsecastle Bay. Continue to follow the well-worn paths along the clifftops (care should be taken when walking here) to reach the dramatic setting of St <mark>Abb</mark>'s Head Lighthouse.</P><P><STRONG>3</STRONG> Walk around the front of the lighthouse buildings to reach a single-track road. Follow this a little inland away from the lighthouse, dropping down towards Mire Loch to reach a cattle grid.</P><P><STRONG>4</STRONG> Turn left on to a path here. This is indistinct at first but improves as you follow it by the loch (which is to your left), where there is a fantastic variety of flora and fauna. Continue to the head of the loch to reach a gate.</P><P><STRONG>5</STRONG> Turn right on to a broad track and follow this to a road.</P><P><STRONG>6</STRONG> Here turn left and continue over a cattle grid and then follow a tarmac track down through some beautiful, open countryside to eventually return to the car park.</P><DIV class=""submeta""><SPAN class=""submeta__label"">Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

		Friday, 22 December 2017 00:00	</TD></TR><TR><TD valign=""top""><DIV><mark>BASF</mark> South Asia Chairman Dr. Raman Ramachandran who delivered the key note address at the inauguration of the 2017 symposium of the Employers’ Federation of Ceylon (EFC) themed, ‘<mark>Sustainable</mark> Enterprises- creating value’, noted that <mark>sustainable</mark> sourcing practices at workplace and motivating employees are the two key elements which would ensure the stability, the future and the sustainability of a company. Following are the excerpts of a pre-symposium discussion Dr. Ramachandra had with the EFC:</DIV><DIV><STRONG>Q: How important it is for organizations to champion <mark>sustainable</mark> practices at all levels including economic, social and environmental?</STRONG></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>A: Sustainability, by its definition, encompasses the three dimensions of economy, society and environment. There is growing recognition in the private sector of the pivotal role that it can play in creating a more <mark>sustainable</mark> world. Organizations are increasingly emphasizing a holistic approach to business which encompasses all the three dimensions of sustainability. Organizations are not only voluntarily adopting greater sustainability in their operations but also increasingly moving towards transparent and integrated reporting of sustainability. <mark>BASF</mark>, for instance, publishes an integrated Annual Report that covers its environmental, economic and social performance.</DIV><DIV>Organizations are a pivotal part of an emerging ecosystem that is pushing sustainability to the centre stage. There is increasing pressure from consumers and investors to adopt more <mark>sustainable</mark> business models. According to Nielsen’s 2015 report on new insights on consumer expectations, 66 % of global consumers say they are willing to pay more for <mark>sustainable</mark> brands—up from 55% in 2014 and 50% in 2013. Investors today are increasingly factoring <mark>climate</mark> risks into their decision making. They are considering both <mark>climate</mark> risks and opportunities that a company’s products pose as also environment related regulations that may affect the company’s profits in the future. Governments too are enforcing regulations for a more <mark>sustainable</mark> world. International treaties like the Paris Treaty on <mark>Climate change</mark>, by setting country specific goals, are obligating all stakeholders, including the private sector, to move towards more <mark>sustainable</mark> policies and practices.<SPAN style=""font-size: 12.16px""> </SPAN><SPAN style=""font-size: 12.16px"">Today, therefore, for organizations, there is both an internal and external impetus towards greater sustainability.</SPAN></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><STRONG>Q: What is the impact of ‘<mark>sustainable</mark> practices’ in generating employment and retaining talent within an organization?</STRONG></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>A: Employees, especially the younger workforce, increasingly view organizations through the prism of the value they bring to society. According to a 2011 Deloitte study, 61% of millennials feel a company’s commitment to the community would influence their career choice. Therefore, organizations that are committed to sustainability would find it easier to attract the best talent. <mark>BASF</mark> is committed to playing its role in helping achieve the UN SDGs through its <mark>sustainable</mark> products &amp; technologies and its abiding commitment to society. In 2016, <mark>BASF</mark> spent Euro 47 million in donations and sponsorships for social causes.</DIV><DIV>Organizations that have well defined human resource policies, that place the employee at the center stage, are more likely to retain talent. At <mark>BASF</mark> we follow global labour and social standards. Our voluntary commitment to respecting international labour and social standards is embedded in our global Code of Conduct. This encompasses internationally recognised labour norms as stipulated in the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the Tripartite Declaration of principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy of the International Labour Organisation (ILO).</DIV><DIV>We are also committed to the safety of workers in the production process and globally we have a specific sustainability goal of reducing worldwide loss-time injury rate per one million working hours to less than 0.5 by 2025. We also have a firm belief in promoting diversity as a part of the company culture and have set a global target of having 22-24% women in leadership positions with disciplinary responsibility by 2021. We have already achieved 19.8%. We also believe in striking the right balance between professional and personal life. In Sri Lanka, we have introduced flexi-working hours and a work from home policy. In addition, we have amended the leave policy to allow leave for bereavement, marriage and maternity.  </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><STRONG>Q: How important it is to create a business-enabling environment by all stakeholders (both state and private) concerned in championing <mark>sustainable</mark> enterprises?</STRONG></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>A: It is very important to create an enabling environment for encouraging organizations to adopt more <mark>sustainable</mark> practices. Policy makers have an especially important role to play in creating such an environment. Supportive regulations play an important role in this regard. For example, in the social dimension of sustainability, Governments are increasingly encouraging organizations to adopt CSR programmes. Many countries are adopting voluntary guidelines while some like, India, have enacted a law that mandates compulsory CSR spending. </DIV><DIV>Well-conceived environmental regulations by Governments also play an important role in creating a supportive environment for adoption of <mark>sustainable</mark> practices. As the world witnesses increasing environmental threats, countries are introducing regulations for protecting the environment and countering the threat of <mark>climate change</mark>. <mark>Carbon</mark> tax, in some form or the other, is applicable in many countries and this, by discouraging the use of fossil fuels, is opening up new <mark>sustainable</mark> business opportunities. The rapidly growing renewable energy space is an example of how environmental regulations are opening up business opportunities for the private sector. </DIV><DIV>International treaties like the Paris Treaty on <mark>Climate Change</mark> are also playing an important role. Goals set under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by each country have defined the contours of each country’s <mark>climate policy</mark>. The success in achieving NDCs will depend crucially on the contribution of the private sector. </DIV><DIV>The involvement of other important stakeholders like civil society, academia and environmental organizations are also critical. It is important that all these stakeholders work closely with the Government and private sector to help create a supportive ecosystem for a more <mark>sustainable</mark> world. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><STRONG>Q: What are some of the key best practices adopted by <mark>BASF</mark> in relation to <mark>sustainable</mark> enterprise?</STRONG></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>A: Sustainability is at the core of <mark>BASF</mark>’s existence. We carry out our corporate purpose, “We create chemistry for a <mark>sustainable</mark> future,” by pursuing ambitious goals along our entire value chain.</DIV><DIV><mark>BASF</mark> is a solution provider in the field of sustainability. We undertook a massive <mark>sustainable</mark> solution steering exercise to classify all of our 60,000 products and solutions into four categories. The leading category is accelerator products, which have a substantial sustainability contribution in the value chain. These accelerators find a natural fit in addressing many of the mega sustainability challenges we confront – air <mark>pollution</mark>, waste management, transportation, affordable housing and malnourishment. Nearly 27% of <mark>BASF</mark> sales come from such products.</DIV><DIV><mark>BASF</mark> spends nearly 2 billion Euro annually on R &amp; D, 60 % of which is spent on developing products with excellent sustainability performance. These products have helped avoid emissions of 540 million tons of <mark>CO2</mark> equivalent by our customers in 2016.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><mark>BASF</mark> has clearly defined Sustainability goals. Some of these are listed below</DIV><DIV> </DIV></TD></TR><TR><TD><STRONG>2020 Goal </STRONG></TD><TD><STRONG>Status at end of 2016</STRONG> </TD></TR><TR><TD> Increase the proportion of sales generated by products that make a particular contribution to susta¬inable development (“Accelerators”)</TD><TD>  28%</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

                                2018-02-07 - The collaboration leveraged ABB’s technology leadership and <mark>BASF</mark>’s industry expertise to highlight new growth opportunities for the chemical industry.
                            </P></DIV><DIV class=""bodyText"">
                        Transformation is key to continued success in the chemical industry. The hyper competitive nature of the chemicals business is forcing leaders to look to digital technology as a means of delivering competitive advantage. With the rising standards of living and higher disposable incomes, the global chemicals demand is expected to more than double by 2030, hence the industry needs to brace itself for rapid technology disruption in an evolving energy landscape. Companies must continue to evolve to meet the headwinds and challenges from mega trends, macroeconomic factors, energy volatility and fast-paced technology which could bring huge rewards yet also risks to established chemical sectors. 
<P>With this backdrop, ABB demonstrated how the concepts of automation and digitalization can be applied to chemicals operations to make them more efficient and productive by significantly reducing costs, schedule and risks at the 12<SUP>th</SUP> Annual Gulf Petrochemical and Chemical Association (GPCA) forum in Dubai.  <mark>BASF</mark>, the largest chemical producer in the world joined forces with ABB to host a seminar on ‘Digitalization in the chemical industry.’ During the session at the GPCA forum, close to 200 industry experts came together to discuss the current state of the chemicals market and how digital technologies will and are already impacting it.<B>Insights from the session</B>
Dr. Frithjof Netzer, Chief Digital Officer, <mark>BASF</mark> kicked off the session by giving insights to the digital journey at <mark>BASF</mark>. “It is clear that digitalization continues to be a source of transformational change for the chemical industry. It allows us to add value to our customers through digitally enabled products and services. ABB has been an innovative partner throughout our journey towards a digital future.” said Dr. Netzer. 
 “The digital journey – and the fact that value creation happens at every level: device, process, plant and enterprise – is changing the way we are thinking and working. This transformation is improving how we build relationships with customers, partners and each other,” commented Havard Devold, Global Digital leader from ABB’s Oil, Gas and Chemicals business during his presentation on ABB Ability<SUP>TM </SUP>, ABB’s digital solution to the market.  Mr. Devold used proven examples of where ABB Ability™ creates powerful solutions and services that solve real business problems and produce tangible business opportunities, helping consumption.
The team talked about how this disruptive change isn’t only impacting existing facilities but it has also changed the tone for the future of project execution within the chemical industry.  Dan Overly, Global Head of Product Management, ABB Oil Gas and Chemicals said, “The way companies are approaching projects has changed significantly.  Cost overruns and schedule delays are no longer acceptable. By putting the customer’s needs first we are moving our focus from product-centric to a more ‘outside-in’ approach. This means having much better understanding of customer pain-points and where we can help them to identify opportunities for their business.”
In the Middle East, there is an overall strategic shift from producing commodity chemicals and petrochemicals to going further downstream into specialty chemicals, spreading further out into the value chain of the oil, gas and chemical sectors. Experts during the session discussed how the region is deploying more and more advanced technologies in many new mega projects as well as in upgradation and expansion programmes of existing facilities. It has been integrated equipment, systems and technologies that have made many of the early-adopter projects successful. Sadara Chemical Company (Sadara) – a joint venture between Saudi Aramco and The Dow Chemical Company – is a striking project where ABB has delivered all process control systems across the 26 integrated world-scale plants. 
“Automation and digitalization done in the right way will further improve the uptime, productivity, energy efficiency and safety in the downstream industry. There is already a massive impact of automation and digitalization in the refineries and petrochemical facilities, and this trend is going to be more powerful in the future. The direction of this technology development is not just connecting systems but running them in a collaborative way with an increasing degree of autonomy. The way humans collaborate with plants is changing and ABB is at the forefront of helping customers to be successful,” summarized Joerg Theis, Global Head of Service, ABB Oil, Gas and Chemicals. <B>Trends to push the industry forward</B>
The GPCA session with <mark>BASF</mark> brought light to many of the trends around digitalization and disruptive technologies.  Global megatrends and challenges like ageing workforce, need for higher productivity, drive for safe and secure operations, <mark>climate change</mark> and urbanization along with population growth will continue to push the chemical industry to identify and implement <mark>sustainable</mark> solutions and embed rapid <mark>innovation</mark>. There is a strong need for industry collaboration, like ABB and <mark>BASF</mark>, as newer players emerge and global trade practices and regulations change faster than ever. It is time for industry players to work in parallel and think global as game changing technologies take hold. </P><P>ABB (ABBN: SIX Swiss Ex) is a pioneering technology leader in electrification products, robotics and motion, industrial automation and power grids, serving customers in utilities, industry and transport &amp; infrastructure globally. Continuing a history of <mark>innovation</mark> spanning more than 130 years, ABB today is writing the future of industrial digitalization and driving the Energy and Fourth Industrial Revolutions. As title partner of Formula E, the fully electric international FIA motorsport class, ABB is pushing the boundaries of e-mobility to contribute to a <mark>sustainable</mark> future.

That’s when <mark>BASF</mark> stepped in and decided to be part of the solution.</P><P>“Due to a perception that habitat loss was responsible for declining populations, we felt it was important to determine how the agricultural community could develop additional habitat in non-crop areas,” said Burleson Smith, Regulatory Affairs Manager, <mark>BASF</mark>, who’s been involved in this project from the start.</P><P><mark>BASF</mark> launched a biodiversity research initiative called<A class=""externalLink"" href=""http://agro.<mark>basf</mark>.us/living-acres/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> Living Acres</A> two years ago in Holly Springs, N.C., in hope of increasing the monarchs’ population by<A class=""externalLink"" href=""https://www.usgs.gov/news/more-milkweeds-located-throughout-landscape-can-help-conserve-monarchs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> planting milkweed</A> in non-crop areas, such as ditches, roadsides, alleyways and border areas. The objective was to provide information to farmers about planting milkweed in non-crop areas in an economic and practical manner. <mark>BASF</mark> followed up this effort by spreading the word on social media this year and launching the<A class=""externalLink"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/<mark>BASF</mark>.LivingAcres/app/?sk=app_234658916574732"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> Monarch Challenge</A> on Facebook, encouraging farmers to sign up to receive a free milkweed starter kit and grow the plants to increase biodiversity. More than 1300 farm families signed up, exceeding <mark>BASF</mark>’s 500 goal for the year. <mark>BASF</mark> sent out 500 milkweed starter kits, consisting of 18 milkweed seedlings, which totaled 9,000 milkweed seedlings this year.</P><P>Aside from being a monarch larvae’s sole food, milkweed is also slightly toxic to most animals and insects, save for the monarchs, who metabolize it and incorporate it into their bodies, which protects them from danger. Research efforts have shown much better long-term success when milkweed plots were started with seedlings or root cuttings rather than seeds, according to Laura Vance, Living Acres Biology Representative, <mark>BASF</mark>.</P><P>As <mark>BASF</mark>’s initiative continues to gain more traction and corporations, such as agricultural company<A class=""externalLink"" href=""http://www.chsinc.com/our-company/news-and-media/news/2017/05/01/chs-inc-accepts-the-<mark>basf</mark>-monarch-challenge"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> CHS</A>, and universities started getting involved, the chemical company decided to go the extra mile and extend the Monarch Challenge to professional and specialty solutions businesses, such as turf grass customers. In June, the challenge included its first golf course—North Carolina State University’s Lonnie Poole. Volunteers from the college and <mark>BASF</mark>’s crop protection division in Raleigh collaborated to plant a variety of milkweed plants.</P><P>According to Moore,</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“Golf courses have ample opportunity to create quality habitat for pollinators and monarchs.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>“They cover large amounts of area and they already have the capacity to maintain their ground, so approaching them about small changes, like adding milkweed and nectar plants is not an issue.”</P><P>About 750 milkweed plants and wildflowers were planted in low-impact areas of the golf course in hopes of establishing monarch habitat.</P><P><mark>BASF</mark>’s goal with this initiative is to show how modern agriculture can coexist with refuges for monarchs and play an important role in promoting biodiversity of wildlife future generations.</P><P>“Now when I look at a garden, I see it totally different than I did before,” Vance added. “I look at which insects are on which flower, and then where are they going. It connects you more with this larger cycle.”</P></DIV><FOOTER><DIV class=""td-post-source-tags""><UL class=""td-tags td-post-small-box clearfix""><LI><SPAN>TAGS</SPAN></LI></UL></DIV></FOOTER></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

If invasives out-compete natives, global changes that elevate resource availability may interact with invasives to exacerbate impacts on native communities. Indeed, evidence is accumulating that elevated <mark>CO(2)</mark> and N deposition decrease native biomass and simultaneously increase invasive biomass. However, superior competitive ability, and a relative increase in the magnitude of invasive impacts under elevated resource availability, remain to be definitively proven. Using model, multi-species, multi-individual riparian plant communities, where planting density was maintained by replacement of native with exotic individuals, we conducted a greenhouse, competition experiment using native (to the UK) and invaded communities exposed to ambient and elevated <mark>CO(2)</mark> (<mark>CO(2)</mark> experiment) or N availability (N experiment). We tested two hypotheses: (1) invasives are superior competitors to natives at ambient atmospheric <mark>CO(2)</mark> and N deposition; (2) negative effects of invasives on natives are exacerbated under elevated <mark>CO(2)</mark> or N availability. Our results provide some support for the first hypothesis: in the <mark>CO(2)</mark> experiment native biomass was significantly lower in invaded communities. In the N experiment, native biomass was unaffected by the presence of exotics but other characteristics (e.g. root:shoot ratios) were altered. Differences in light availability between the experiments may have modified the effects of the invasives on the native assemblages but our design did not permit us to determine this definitively. The hypothesis that elevated <mark>CO(2)</mark> and N availability benefit invasives at the expense of natives was not supported by our results. This may be explained either because the invasives showed minor responses to the resource manipulations or because native and exotic species were differentially limited by <mark>CO(2)</mark> and N. Our results confirm the expectation that invasives alter the characteristics of native assemblages but lead us to question whether elevated resource availability will magnify these effects.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In 2015, USGBC participated in two events hosted by <mark>BASF</mark>’s Creator Space™ to examine paths to resilience in urban, coastal neighborhoods. Findings from those discussions were recently published in the whitepaper “<A href=""https://creator-space.<mark>basf</mark>.com/content/<mark>basf</mark>/creatorspace/en/celebrating-150/white_papers/new-york-whitepaper.html"" target=""_blank"">Co-creating solutions for urban neighborhoods in coastal cities</A>.&quot;</EM></P><P>Coastal cities are on the front lines of <mark>climate change</mark> impacts. Cities such as New York are increasingly being affected by devastating storms and events that threaten natural resources, infrastructure and communities. A greater understanding of where and how communities are vulnerable to loss from coastal hazards is leading to the adoption of planning and development practices that help dictate the ability to bounce back and limit the amount of loss after damaging storms and events.  </P><P>In an effort to address some of these issues, <mark>BASF</mark> held a Creator Space<SPAN> New York City</SPAN> tour in May 2015. The aim was create strategies to improve urban living in coastal areas, using the Red Hook area of Brooklyn, N.Y. to serve as a model for other communities recovering from disasters. A diverse collection of industry experts, including members of USGBC, local residents and academics converged during two key Creator Space events, the Summit on Urban Living and the Creator Space Design Competition.</P><P>The events focused on three broad areas: habitat, citizenship and resilience, all aimed at improving the quality of life in Red Hook.</P><P>Ideas generated from the summit are captured in the white paper<SPAN>,</SPAN> which contains actionable recommendations for both rebuilding the community and increasing the resilience of infrastructure and buildings in the event of rising sea levels. Three ideas, featured below, represent ways to further resiliency and sustainability for coastal cities around the globe. Although these ideas could work in isolation, their impact is exponential when deployed holistically.</P><P><STRONG>Establish a network of green corridors:</STRONG> In addition to enhancing circulation and absorbing or channeling runoff from rainstorms to increase flood resilience, re-landscaping required to create green corridors would also improve social cohesion and reduce Red Hook’s isolation through shared spaces for pedestrians, as well as allowing for increased community interaction.</P><P><STRONG>Create a coastal park</STRONG>: To work in harmony with an ever-changing environment, a coastal park would serve not only as a first line of defense from storm surges and rising sea levels, but would also double as protection and recreational space for Red Hook’s residents. A second line of protection farther from the shoreline, consisting of breakwaters, dikes and ponds, would help absorb storm surges.</P><P><STRONG>Inspire with a model block:</STRONG> The concept behind the model block could demonstrate how smart design, the latest technology from <mark>BASF</mark>, can affordably preserve the character of a neighborhood and contribute to its resiliency and sustainability. Additionally, it serves to demonstrate a framework for <mark>sustainable</mark> and efficient living and working in an urban environment.</P><P> </P><P>Since the summit, <mark>BASF</mark> is continuing the dialogue among multiple stakeholders to share the solutions developed from the summit in an effort to help other coastal communities benefit from the research and findings. We are also exploring opportunities with private development partners, government advocates and NGOs with local interests that recognize the value of investing in a more resilient Red Hook. We see community engagement as paramount to the success of this effort and are establishing strong relationships with local residents, neighborhood businesses and key stakeholders to address consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> on the environment.</P><P>We are feeling the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> across the globe. As the frequency and intensity of natural disasters become increasingly common, building greater resilience in coastal communities in a timely and responsible manner is of the utmost importance and requires investment, <mark>innovation</mark> and action. Extreme weather events, like Superstorm Sandy, remind us that development cannot occur without addressing <mark>climate change</mark> and sea level rise.</P></SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In a 2015 report co-authored by Honeycutt titled, “Lowering the Ozone Standard Will Not Measurably Improve Public health,” the authors write, “The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality argues that the thoughtful integration of scientific data does not support the assumption that tightening the <A href=""https://energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Shaw-Lange-and-Honeycutt-EM-2015-Ozone-Health-Benefits.pdf"">ozone standard</A> will result in measurable health benefits.”  Honeycutt has repeatedly made public statements and testified in Congress to <A href=""https://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/hearings/HHRG-112-%20SY20-WState-MHoneycutt-20120606.pdf"">dispute the harmfulness of smog</A> (ground-level ozone) and soot (PM2.5) air <mark>pollution</mark>.

D'Aleo said his priority on the board would be attacking the endangerment finding, the legally binding document that holds that <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and other greenhouse gases harm human health and must be regulated by the executive branch. He said he wants to challenge the finding because it could otherwise be used later to build back Obama-era environmental regulations. &quot;We're going to push for reconsideration, start from scratch and put together the best science,&quot; he said. &quot;If <mark>CO2</mark> is not a serious pollutant, let's focus the attention of the EPA on other issues.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Edwin Berry</STRONG> funded his own <mark>climate</mark> research and says human <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions do not cause <mark>climate change</mark>.

Berry, in an email to E&amp;E News, described his tweet as a joke and said he does not advocate violence…. Berry, who confirmed that he and a number of other skeptics were nominated by Heartland, said he wants to use his position on the board to show that humans barely contribute to atmospheric <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels, which he claimed are mostly driven by natural factors. &quot;Let's get over this whole thing about <mark>climate change</mark> being an important thing, because in fact we humans have a negligible impact on <mark>climate</mark>,&quot; he said.</P><P><STRONG>Alan Carlin</STRONG>, a retired EPA employee who is affiliated with Heartland fought the agency's crafting of the endangerment finding. Carlin, an economist, was at the center of a political firestorm under Obama after he produced a widely criticized 93-page report comprising cherry-picked scientific data and blog entries concluding that regulating <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide was &quot;the worst mistake that EPA has ever made.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Kevin Dayaratna</STRONG>, a statistician at the conservative Heritage Foundation: His report was cited by Trump as a reason to withdraw from the Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord. It claimed that the agreement could shrink U.S. gross domestic product by $2.5 trillion within two decades (though Trump stated the impact as coming within a decade). The report was criticized by some as being misleading, because that amount is less than 1 percent of the aggregate GDP over that period and the report did not account for the cost of taking no <mark>climate change</mark> action. Dayaratna was invited to attend Trump's withdrawal announcement in June in the White House Rose Garden.</P><P><STRONG>Paul Driessen</STRONG>, a senior policy adviser at the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, a libertarian environmental think tank: His organization handed out leaflets at a <mark>climate</mark> protest this year in Washington, D.C., that said, &quot;<mark>CO2</mark> is not the 'control knob' of the <mark>climate</mark>.&quot; He also co-founded <mark>Climate</mark> Exit, or &quot;Clexit,&quot; which criticized the science behind the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement and holds that spiking levels of atmospheric <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide benefit the Earth. &quot;The world must abandon this suicidal Global Warming crusade,&quot; the group stated in its founding statement. &quot;Man does not and cannot control the <mark>climate</mark>.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Gordon Fulks</STRONG>, a physicist and adviser to the Cascade Policy Institute, an Oregon-based libertarian think tank: He has denied that net sea ice melt is occurring and that the Earth is warming.

Smith kicked off the event, saying, “As we celebrate this milestone, we are connecting people with ideas to make meaningful contributions to society in accordance with our corporate purpose: ‘We create chemistry for a <mark>sustainable</mark> future.’”</P><H3>Resilience for Red Hook</H3><P>The meaningful contribution for this particular summit was aimed at the question of the future of the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, an area devastated by Hurricane Sandy. Red Hook was selected because it typifies in many ways the kind of vibrant oceanfront community that has tough choices ahead, including the threat of future storms, growing population, economic inequality and the desire to maintain the unique characteristics that give the area its sense of identity and community.</P><P>A number of knowledgeable contributors were invited to the event to serve as co-creators. These included architects, city planners, engineers and artists as well as Red Hook community residents.</P><P>I participated with a group focused on resilience, with a specific emphasis on the space outside of or between the buildings. <A href=""https://www.stevens.edu/news/content/former-nyc-chief-urban-designer-alexandros-washburn-joins-stevens-institute-technology"">Alex Washburn</A>, founding director of the <A href=""https://www.stevens.edu/sse/research/research-centers/crux"">Center for Coastal Resilience and Urban eXcellence at Stevens Institute of Technology</A>, was on the team, as were members of <mark>BASF</mark>’s <A href=""http://www2.<mark>basf</mark>construction.us/cbe"">Center for Building Excellence</A>. Washburn, former NYC chief urban designer, himself a resident of Red Hook, recently published <A href=""http://islandpress.org/nature-urban-design"">“The Nature of Urban Design: A New York Perspective on Resilience.”</A> He emphasized that resilience is needed at all levels — “in materials, in structures, and in communities.”</P><H3>Suggested solutions: Barriers, elevation, floating buildings</H3><P>The team spent two days developing solutions. A number of ideas emerged that generally fell into three camps.</P><DIV class=""media media-element-container media-gbz_image_with_caption""><DIV class=""field field-name-gbz-media-attribution""><DIV class=""media-attribution""><SPAN class=""gbz-attribution""><A href=""https://www.flickr.com"">Flickr</A></SPAN><SPAN class=""gbz-attribution""> Wojtek Gurak</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""image-caption""><P>Floating houses such as these in the IJburg area of Amsterdam could be a good solution for Red Hook and other urban neighborhoods threatened by rising seas.</P></DIV></DIV>The first was to develop some kind of barrier system to help shield against future storm surges. The challenge here was to avoid turning the community into a fortress, destroying its character while protecting its assets. A combination of fixed and deployable barriers was proposed, with the idea that the fixed barrier, which would extend out into the water in places, have a bike path atop it, which would provide a recreational and scenic attraction. Red Hook is the only area in NYC with a full frontal view of the Statue of Liberty. Temporary barriers could be made available in the interim as this longer term barrier was put into place.<P>A second set of ideas collected around the notion of raising the neighborhood to a second story level, gradually moving assets up to the second floor of buildings while shoring up and waterproofing the first floor, in preparation for some time in the future when the area could exist as a city in the water, such as Venice, Italy. This could be supplemented by raised walkways and pedestrian areas that could elevate the “street life” to the second story level, so that people could window-shop at this level or even dine at second-story sidewalk cafes.</P><P>The third area of <mark>innovation</mark> had to do with floating assets. This was inspired, at least in part, by a home developed as part of the <A href=""https://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2011/12/30/how-green-building-can-bring-new-orleans-back"">Make It Right development</A> in <A href=""http://www.triplepundit.com/2010/06/resilient-new-orleans-still-rebuilding-from-last-disaster-as-it-braces-for-the-next-part-2/"">New Orleans’ lower ninth ward</A>, designed to float in the event of a storm. The home was built on a foundation of Styrofoam wrapped in concrete that was buoyant enough to raise the home in a flood, while remaining tethered to poles that would keep the home from being swept away. Utilities are connected to the home with flexible wires and pipes. The approach could be applied to homes, business or to critical assets such as power plants or communications infrastructure.</P><P>Indeed, this last idea was not far off from what one group of distinguished experts deemed one of the most likely <A href=""http://<mark>sustainable</mark>citiescollective.com/david-thorpe/1077131/top-10-most-likely-architectural-advancements-next-50-years"">architectural advancements of the next 50 years</A>: <A href=""https://www.greenbiz.com/article/seasteading-may-be-answer-sustainably-feeding-9-billion-people"">floating cities</A>. These cities, which potentially could harness both wave and solar power, were given a 30 percent probability of being realized.</P><P>One major advantage of making a city float, in an era of rising seas, is that unlike barrier systems, you don’t have to try to guess how high oceans will rise or how high storm surges might reach. On the other hand, riding out a hurricane on an floating island could be a memorable, but not necessarily pleasant, experience.</P><P>Other teams at the Summit developed concepts related to <A href=""http://www.triplepundit.com/2015/05/<mark>basf</mark>-creatorspace-nyc-confronts-post-sandy-neighborhood-realities/"">resilient buildings, habitat and citizenship</A>.

Hopes are fading that the European Commission can match “nice words” with action, EURACTIV was told.</P><P>The EU’s 28 industry ministers gathered in Brussels on 20 February for a meeting of the Competitiveness Council which discussed a European Commission policy paper (<A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/4108/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native"">communication</A>) for an “industrial renaissance”, published earlier in January.</P><P>“As you know, for Europe, energy prices are a big problem,” said Antonio Tajani, the Italian commissioner in charge of enterprise and industry behind the <A href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-42_en.htm"">industrial renaissance</A> initiative.</P><P>Speaking to the press after the meeting, Tajani said: “The first action by the European Commission is to put on the table for the first time the money for European re-industrialisation – one hundred billion euros coming from regional funds.” Other funds available for re-industrialisation include the €40 billion available for <mark>innovation</mark> and scientific research under the <A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/"">Horizon 2020</A> programme, which runs until the end of the decade.</P><P>“First of all, we aim to address the high cost of energy and the lack of a unified energy market. I believe that this is probably the most important priority,” added Kostis Hatzidakis, the Greek minister for development and competitiveness who was chairing the ministerial meeting.</P><P>“We need to mitigate the negative impact of the high cost of energy which is twice higher than in the USA, or Russia. Especially, EU gas is three to four times more expensive [for EU companies] than for the USA, the Russian and the Indian competitors.”</P><P>Hatzidakis said the Greek EU presidency was preparing a letter with concrete proposals on energy prices for the spring EU summit on 20-21 March that will feature a debate on industrial competitiveness.</P><P>But he warned that the Greek EU presidency “cannot work out miracles within six months”.</P><P>“What we can do is lay the foundation for the new European Commission that will be formed after the elections to bring forward concrete legislative proposals,” Hatzidakis said.</P><P><STRONG>‘Nice words’</STRONG></P><P>This came as a major disappointment for business representatives who claim ministers shied away from stating the obvious, that current energy and <mark>climate change</mark> policies deteriorate the EU’s competitiveness and therefore urgently need correction.</P><P>Instead of clear-cut language, the <A href=""http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/intm/141115.pdf"">meeting’s conclusions</A> listed a number of research papers, including one by the European Commission on the <A href=""http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&amp;t=PDF&amp;gc=true&amp;sc=false&amp;f=ST%205599%202014%20REV%201"">high cost of energy</A> in Europe, but stopped short of saying what needs to be done to correct the situation.</P><P>In the US, cheap shale gas has turned around the fortunes of the world’s largest economy. The cost of electricity in the United States is a third or half that of the EU and gas prices are just one third of those seen on the old continent.</P><P>“The USA currently attracts massively industrial investments and jobs: This is a true industrial renaissance in the US,” said Peter Botschek of the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC), which represents 29,000 companies, producing about a fifth of the world’s chemicals.</P><P>By contrast, EU statements about an “industrial renaissance” were just “nice words”, Botschek told EURACTIV.</P><P><STRONG>‘More and better jobs’</STRONG></P><P>The European Commission’s ‘<A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/4108/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native"">Industrial Renaissance</A>‘ paper is scheduled to be on the table of the next meeting of EU heads of state and governments on 20-21 March, which will mainly focus on “growth, competitiveness and jobs”.</P><P>But Botschek said that the EU’s recurring calls for “more and better jobs” would remain empty words if the Commission did not back it with actual policy measures.</P><P>Both CEFIC and BusinessEurope, the powerful employer’s association, have underlined the reforms they believe are necessary to that end and will drive those points home again ahead of the March and June European Council meetings of heads of state and government.</P><P>“Indeed the re-industrialisation of Europe is the hostage of an ambitious goal given the relatively high energy costs,” said Botschek, adding that energy costs have been relatively higher in Europe than in other regions for many years.</P><P>“Two factors are changing the game,” he said – the emergence of shale gas in the US and increasing energy costs in Europe, where energy policy is “subdued to <mark>climate policy</mark> ambitions”.</P><P>“We did so by creating <mark>carbon</mark> costs, surcharges and taxes in order to stimulate low-<mark>carbon</mark> investment and to subsidise power production from alternative – but largely uncompetitive and unreliable – energy sources such as solar and wind. Those energy sources have been granted priority access to the grids thereby undermining the EU’s energy market design and the EU’s energy market liberalisation policies that aim for an EU Internal Energy Market to be realised in 2014,” Botschek explained.</P><P>The CEFIC representative said EU policies should instead focus on diversifying energy supplies, putting in place a functioning single energy market, and introduce <mark>climate</mark> policies that encourage rather than hinder growth in the manufacturing sector.</P><P>Botschek admitted that such policies would likely run into fierce opposition from environmentalists and some policymakers. “But we have seen also a massive campaign in the run-up to the Commission proposal for the 2030 framework, all geared at pushing further on the current policy which entails higher costs for Europe,” he contended.</P><P>“20 million unemployed in Europe speak their own language and this cannot continue to be ignored,” Botschek stressed, underlining the negative economic consequences of the EU’s “unilateral” <mark>climate</mark> policies.</P><P><STRONG>2030 targets for renewable energy and <mark>climate change</mark></STRONG></P><P>A European Commission consultation document, or ‘Green Paper’, for the EU’s 2030 <mark>climate</mark> and energy policy mentions a potential greenhouse gas emission-reduction target of 40%, and does not close the door on a 30% target for the proportion of energy that renewables should make up by 2030.</P><P>For the German chemical company <mark>BASF</mark>, the difference in energy price between Europe and the US is already driving investment decisions that may have consequences down the line for industrial jobs in Europe and Germany.</P><P>“Our sites are in competition with each other and with such a huge difference in energy prices, the decision is clear – the money is not going there [in Europe],” said Claus Beckmann, head of <mark>BASF</mark>’s energy and <mark>climate policy</mark> unit.</P><P>He cautioned however that decisions to relocate factories or build new ones would not happen overnight but over the long run. “It’s a question of time,” Beckman told journalists at a briefing at <mark>BASF</mark> offices in Brussels on 25 February. “We think the market for chemicals will increase in the future. The question is only where the production will be located.”</P><P>“It depends on what the public is willing to pay for <mark>climate</mark> action,” added Brigitta Huckestein, a senior manager for energy and <mark>climate policy</mark> at <mark>BASF</mark>. “I do not believe that the public is aware of this – that it will cost them money if they are going for such a high goal.”</P><DIV class=""ea-article-custom""><DIV class=""ea-article-custom-item""><H4>Positions</H4><DIV><P><STRONG>The European Federation of Waste Management and Environmental Services (FEAD)</STRONG> called on the European Commission to revise the draft guidelines on environmental and energy state aid for 2014-2020 so the recycling industry is also protected from higher energy costs resulting from funding of support to energy from renewable sources.</P><P>FEAD members draw attention to the fact that the draft Guidelines stress that state aid should be limited to sectors that are exposed to a significant risk of <mark>carbon</mark> leakage due to the funding of support to energy from renewable sources.</P><P>“If the draft Guidelines recognise that state aid should be limited <EM>only </EM>to sectors that are exposed to a significant risk of <mark>carbon</mark> leakage, the European private waste management industry would have to face high energy costs. Recycling activity benefits the environment through the avoidance of emissions in primary production processes and EU policy is designed to encourage higher levels of recycling. The impact of higher energy prices resulting from the promotion of renewable energies could inadvertently reduce the incentive for recycling activity to be maximised across the EU”, FEAD states.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""ea-article-custom-item""><H4>Background</H4><DIV><P>In May 2013, the powerful employers’ group BusinessEurope called on European Commission President José Manuel Barroso to radically shift the EU's energy policy away from <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation towards cost-competitiveness and security of supply.</P><P>But a EU summit dedicated on energy with the objective of lowering prices and boosting the Union’s industrial competitiveness, held on 22 May 2013, ended up without major decisions.

For every 1˚ C rise above optimum growing season temperatures, farmers will likely experience a 10% decline in their yields. And with a growing global population expected to hit 9 billion by 2050, 80 million more people need to be fed each year. Now large agrochemical and seed corporations are developing “<mark>climate</mark>-ready crops” and have filed 1663 patents for genetically engineered (GE) plants with high tolerance for drought, heat, cold and salinity, according to <A href=""http://www.etcgroup.org/en"">ETC</A>, a Canada-based organization focused on <mark>sustainable</mark> and ecological diversity. What are the implications of these <mark>climate</mark>-ready crops?</P><P>Over millennia, agriculture has evolved as farmers identified the most desirable traits in their crops and enhanced crop genetics through selective breeding. Classical breeding involves the exchange of all the tens of thousands of genes in a plant and can only be done with closely related species or genera. In genetic engineering, one or two genes with the desired traits from <EM>any</EM> living organism are transferred directly into the plant’s genome, often resulting in novel gene combinations.</P><P>The desired gene (called a transgene after it’s transferred) is coated onto particles of gold or tungsten and shot into the plant’s cells with a gene gun or transferred into the plant’s DNA via a bacterium. So far, only two GE applications have been available commercially: one produces herbicide tolerant (HT) crops so that fields can be sprayed with Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide (made with the toxin glyphosate) and crops remain unharmed; the second transfers the toxic gene for Bt (<EM>Bacillus thuringiensis) </EM>into the plant to act as a built-in pesticide.</P><P>By 2010, almost 366 million acres around the world were planted with GE crops, with the most acreage in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, India, Canada, and China; developing countries are increasing their GE crops yearly.</P><DIV id=""attachment_15786"" style=""max-width: 225px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Photo credit: TheCleverSheep</P></DIV><P>In the U.S. GE soybeans make up 93% of the U.S. soybean crop, and GE corn is up to 70% of the corn crop. We don’t eat GE crops directly—most of it is used in animal feed—but since there is no requirement that GE products be labeled in the U.S., few Americans realize that as much as 80% of our processed foods contain GE crop ingredients such as corn starch, high fructose corn syrup, canola and cottonseed oil, soy flour, etc. Earlier this year, the Obama administration deregulated Monsanto’s GE alfalfa and sugar beets, which will soon make their way into our sugar and dairy products.</P><P>Proponents of GE crops claim they reduce the use of herbicides and pesticides, increase crop yields, and are safe, but various reports offer conflicting evidence.</P><P><STRONG>Pesticide use:</STRONG><A href=""http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.arplant.043008.092013"">Research by Peggy Lemaux</A>, a scientist at UC Berkeley, found the overall data confirmed that pesticide use for GE crops is lower than that for conventional crops. <A href=""http://truefoodnow.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/13years2009-fullreport-11-16-09.pdf"">The Organic Center reported</A>, however, that while Bt corn and cotton have reduced insecticide use by 64.2 million pounds over the first 13 years commercial GE crops have been in use (1996-2008), HT crops have increased herbicide use by almost 382.6 million pounds in the same period. This is mainly because 15 super weeds resistant to glyphosate have evolved, requiring the use of even more toxic herbicides.</P><P><STRONG>Yield:</STRONG> A <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/failure-to-yield.pdf"">Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) report</A> found that GE soybeans have not increased yields, and GE corn has increased yields only marginally. Other studies have shown a yield reduction of between 5% and 10% in Roundup ready crops when compared to similar non-GE crops.</P><DIV id=""attachment_15785"" style=""max-width: 300px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">GE corn. Photo credit: Peter Blanchard</P></DIV><P>The effects of GE crops on biodiversity are also of concern. Allergens from GE crops can be transferred across crop species, and transgenes can drift from GE crops to organic and non-GE crops. This gene drift could give some plants a selective advantage, allowing them to drive out other varieties. In addition, the Bt toxin in GE crops may harm species not specifically targeted that ingest pollen or plant debris. And because the giant agrochemical and seed companies can make more money from their GE seeds, they will likely stop selling conventional seeds, eventually limiting the variety of seeds available to farmers.</P><P><STRONG>Safety:</STRONG> Lemaux reported that “Although no human activity can be guaranteed 100% safe, the commercial GE crops and products available today are at least as safe as those produced by conventional methods.” However, a recent <A href=""http://www.enveurope.com/content/23/1/10"">European study</A> (GE crops are banned in the European Union) reviewed research done on mammals fed with GE soybeans and maize and found evidence of liver and kidney problems.  The study noted that very few tests have been done on humans to date.</P><P>The bottom line is that there is still a lot we don’t know about GE crops. It is impossible to verify if they perform as they claim to because so little independent research is being done on them. <EM><A href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=do-seed-companies-control-gm-crop-research"">Scientific American</A></EM><A href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=do-seed-companies-control-gm-crop-research""> reported</A> that to gain access to GE seeds, a buyer must sign an agreement that limits what he/she can do with them. Under the guise of protecting their intellectual property, three agrochemical giants, Monsanto, Pioneer and Syngenta, specifically forbid independent research to be done on their seeds. This means that only studies approved by the controlling companies get published in peer-reviewed journals.</P><P>GE crops also have far-reaching socio-economic impacts. Because GE seeds are proprietary, farmers must pay royalties to use them and new seeds must be purchased every season, even as prices rise. Turning their backs on the age-old farming tradition of saving seeds for the next season, farmers must sign contracts agreeing not to reuse and sell GE seeds or risk being sued. As of 2007, Monsanto had filed 112 lawsuits against farmers for patent infringement, including against organic and conventional farmers whose crops were inadvertently contaminated with transgene seeds that blew into their fields.</P><P>It is against this backdrop that the agrochemical and seed corporations have <A href=""http://www.etcgroup.org/upload/publication/pdf_file/FINAL_<mark>climate</mark>-readyComm_106_2010.pdf"">filed broad multi-genome patents</A> for <mark>climate</mark>-ready crops. Six corporations (DuPont, <mark>BASF</mark>, Monsanto, Syngenta, Bayer and Dow) control 77% of the patents. They maintain that these crops will be able to grow in poor soil, and require less rain and fertilizer. For example, Monsanto and <mark>BASF</mark>, who are readying the first GE drought tolerant maize for 2012, say field tests have shown 7% to 10% above average yields. Dow Agrosciences is focusing on products that use fertilizer more efficiently and reduce nitrogen <mark>pollution</mark>. And Arcadia Biosciences is developing GE rice and wheat that can tolerate drought and salinity, and use nitrogen more efficiently.</P><P>These <mark>climate</mark>-ready crop claims sound promising, and it’s quite possible that some of them may also be able to increase crop yield. But the response of plants to environmental stress from temperature and precipitation involves hundreds of genes and is affected by multiple factors such as the timing, intensity, duration and frequency of stresses. According to the UCS, most of the transgenes being researched for the future will affect many genes and result in much more complex effects, some of which may be harmful to the crop or the environment. Can <mark>climate</mark>-ready crops safely deliver what they’re promising when, in over 20 years of GE research, only single gene GE has been made commercially available?</P><DIV id=""attachment_15787"" style=""max-width: 300px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Bt corn in Kenya.</P></DIV><P>ETC calls the stockpiling of <mark>climate</mark>-ready crop patents by the agrochemical giants a “patent grab” in pursuit of an exclusive monopoly and control over the world’s plant biomass. The big corporations have donated “royalty-free” genes and technology to poor developing countries in Africa, but are expecting a lenient regulatory environment in return. ETC warns, “The pretext of <mark>climate</mark>-ready genes will increase farmers’ dependence on GM (genetically modified) crops, jeopardize biodiversity, and threaten global food sovereignty.”</P><P>Is there a better way to produce <mark>climate</mark>-ready crops? Cary Fowler, Executive Director of the <A href=""http://www.croptrust.org"">Global Crop Diversity Trust</A>, believes there is, and contends that we will never be able to solve the problems of <mark>climate change</mark>, energy, water scarcity, or world hunger if we don’t have crop diversity. Towards that end, the Trust is leading an <A href=""http://www.usnews.com/science/articles/2010/12/13/adapting-agriculture-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change?PageNr=1"">initiative</A> with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, to find, catalog, save and use the wild relatives of 23 food crops, including wheat, rice, beans, potato, barley, lentils, alfalfa, banana, and chick peas, to protect the global food supply from the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><DIV id=""attachment_15788"" style=""max-width: 300px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">The Svalbard Global Seed Vault. Photo credit: The Global Crop Diversity Trust</P></DIV><P>The program will identify in the more diverse wild relatives of food crops the traits that allow them to withstand <mark>climate</mark> stress, especially in developing countries where <mark>climate change</mark> is expected to reduce yields by 10% to 30%.  Using conventional breeding techniques, these traits will then be bred into crops to enable them to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>. The 10-year project is a race to collect the biodiversity before it is lost forever and adapt agriculture to <mark>climate change</mark> before it is too late. The <A href=""http://www.croptrust.org/main/video.php"">Svalbard Global Seed Vault</A>, owned and funded by Norway, and situated on a remote island near the North Pole, will safeguard 500 seeds of every agricultural crop and share genetic material and information openly.</P><P>In India, the <A href=""http://www.navdanya.org/organic-movement"">Navdanya Biodiversity Farm</A> founded by scientist and environmentalist <A href=""http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_62725.shtml"">Dr. Vandana Shiva</A>, is also developing <mark>climate</mark>-ready crops by saving 1500 varieties of seeds and growing them out, allowing the plants to naturally adapt to changing <mark>climate</mark> conditions. Navdanya practices organic farming methods that achieve soil fertility and pest control through the enhancement of natural processes and cycles. Shiva’s research has shown that this type of farming produces 2 to 5 times more food per acre than industrial monoculture farming.</P><P>ETC asserts that the keys to <mark>climate</mark> resilience lie in agricultural biodiversity, local seed systems and agro-ecological processes practiced by farming communities. Even if it’s possible to develop GE <mark>climate</mark>-ready crops, might the public/private money being invested in these proprietary products be better spent developing more affordable, local, and low-input farming strategies to truly help the world’s farmers cope with <mark>climate change</mark>?</P><P>To support <mark>sustainable</mark> food systems to meet the challenges of <mark>climate change</mark>, visit <A href=""http://www.fooddemocracynow.org/"">Food Democracy Now! </A></P><DIV class=""wpmchimpa-reset wpmchimpselector wpmchimpab chimpmatecss"" id=""wpmchimpab""><DIV class=""wpmchimpab-inner""><H3>Get our newsletter</H3><DIV class=""wpmchimpa_para""><DIV>I'd like to get more stories like this.</DIV></DIV><FORM action="""" method=""post""><DIV class=""formbox wpmchimpa-field""><DIV class=""wpmchimpa-text wpmc-ficon""><SPAN class=""inputlabel"">Email address</SPAN></DIV></DIV></FORM></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Generally, environmental stresses such as nutrient deficiency, drought, heat and adverse weather can limit opportunities to get the most from their crops in yield and plant health potential.</P><P><mark>BASF</mark> asked growers what their most pressing challenges were. One challenge is that water availability is becoming more variable and challenging to agricultural production. For instance, there are increasing losses through drought in major crops, yield and quality losses through high salt content, and contamination of irrigation water. The need for fresh water exceeds availability. So <mark>BASF</mark> is focusing on products that help plants use water more efficiently, to help farmers reduce irrigation and improve yield.

And that’s a business model set to attract greater scrutiny as scientific understanding about anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> sharpens.</P><DIV id=""attachment_679"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">LIGHTWEIGHT: <mark>BASF</mark>’s Kurt Bock shows off lighter car components made from its engineered plastic but the firm has yet to roll out “holy grail” processes such as those that use <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide as a raw material.</P></DIV><P class=""MsoNormal"">The struggle for companies like <mark>BASF</mark> remains one of doing better for people and planet while also making money for shareholders. Right now the s</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">hareholders appear to be winning. The shift to truly <mark>sustainable</mark> technologies seemingly is too expensive or too difficult – or both. Yes new technologies are being developed, but by and large the pace of change is incremental. And being less bad for the environment doesn’t qualify as <mark>sustainable</mark>.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">As Bock mentioned in Ludwigshafen, truly <mark>sustainable</mark> processes such as those that consume <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide remain the “holy grail” of the chemical industry. But as Bock also noted it was too early for him to be able to provide details about <mark>BASF</mark>’s activities in this field because they haven’t been sufficiently developed.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">On the one hand <mark>BASF</mark> and many other chemical companies could be blamed for this state of affairs: They make a profit and only pay the current value for</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">their raw materials, such as fossil fuels. The next generation will pick up the full (and hidden) costs, including those resulting from <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">On the other hand, all chemical companies are working in the best way that they can within the current regulations and that means staying as profitable as they can, otherwise they might not survive at all.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">A potential solution for breaking this deadlock is to markedly accelerate <mark>innovation</mark> in <mark>sustainable</mark> processes by creating closer ties between academia, industry and government. Government should step up its role of funding R&amp;D for <mark>sustainable</mark> processes, and additionally provide tax breaks and a tax regime that is attractive enough for chemical companies to make the early investment in R&amp;D for truly <mark>sustainable</mark> (not less bad) processes without going broke.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">The need for closer ties between chemical firms and academia and government was a central theme taken up by a panel of experts meeting in the past week at the Royal Society of Chemistry in London as one of the best ways for “future-proofing” chemical companies and the users of chemicals. “Just in the U.K. we throw away the same number of <mark>carbon</mark> atoms that we spend £1.5 trillion [$2.5 trillion] buying in this country,” said industry veteran Ian Shott, who among his other roles is head of the Scotland’s new national center for industrial biotechnology. “There is an enormous opportunity here,” he says.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">So curing the chemical industry’s <mark>climate change</mark> schizophrenia might enable chemical companies and their users to be future-proof too.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">Shott is not the only chemicals expert advocating a closer working relationship between academia and industry as a way of securing growth and unlocking <mark>sustainable</mark> technologies. The other panelists at the RSC meeting, including David Jakubovic, open <mark>innovation</mark> director for Procter &amp; Gamble, Tony Ryan, chemistry professor and pro-vice chancellor for the University of Sheffield in the U.K., and Andrew Burgess, chief scientist for Akzo Nobel, the company hosting the meeting, also voiced support for bringing academics and industrialists closer together to accelerate <mark>innovation</mark>. Cross-fertilization of technologies across the supply chain could further accelerate <mark>innovation</mark>, the panellists agreed.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">The chemical industry’s <mark>climate change</mark> schizophrenia, as demonstrated by Bock, will go on for some time yet. But the sooner the collective chemistry brains from academia and industry come closer together – as advocated by Shott and others – the sooner chemistry can really be unleashed to tackle <mark>climate change</mark>. Then maybe Bock and other chemical industry leaders can start talking about the ‘holy grail’ chemistries that we are really interested in.</P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Expectations for the group to endorse an ambitious <mark>climate</mark> and energy action plan are high but in this guest blog for ICC, Kurt Bock, Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and CEO of <mark>BASF</mark>, and Chairman of the Business-20 (B20) Taskforce on Energy, <mark>Climate</mark> &amp; Resource Efficiency says successful <mark>climate</mark> protection will only be possible through collective, global action.</P></SPAN><P>The Paris Agreement of December 2015 represented a breakthrough: After years of intense negotiations, 195 countries adopted the first global convention on <mark>climate</mark> protection at the United Nations <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference. The goal is to limit the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C compared with pre-industrial levels. The agreement entered into force at the beginning of November 2016. More than two-thirds of the signatory countries have already ratified it. We are now entering the phase where all countries have to rigorously implement the necessary measures. Successful <mark>climate</mark> protection will only be possible with collective, global action.</P><P>“The G20 countries have to work together: Successful <mark>climate</mark> protection will only be possible with collective, global action.”</P><P>During its G20 Presidency, Germany can provide impetus. This group, comprising 19 countries and the European Union, accounts for around three-quarters of global <mark>CO2</mark> emissions. Furthermore, the G20 members generate around 80% of global gross national income*. Their common goal should be to boost the innovative strength of industry and accelerate the development of technologies. Only in this way will industry be able to make its maximum contribution to <mark>climate</mark> protection.</P><P>Companies such as <mark>BASF</mark> are very actively engaged in the Business 20 (B20), the forum for business representatives from the G20 states – including in the Energy, <mark>Climate</mark> and Resource Efficiency Taskforce. An important milestone in this process is the B20 Summit in early May 2017 in Berlin. What is our focus?</P><P>Even if the countries implement all of the currently agreed nationally determined contributions (NDCs), the international community will only be able to limit global warming to 3°C. Furthermore, countries that do not reach their targets will not face sanctions. Since in many countries growth, jobs and prosperity are still more important than <mark>climate</mark> protection, the global community is facing a major challenge in this respect.</P><P><STRONG>Collective, global action on <mark>climate</mark> protection</STRONG></P><P>For example, Germany – a country that accounts for barely 2% of global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions – cannot on its own contribute all that much to reducing emissions. Therefore, the G20 countries in particular have to work together. Europe currently has the world’s most ambitious goals for reducing greenhouse gases. Consequently, European industry bears a heavier burden than its international competitors. We therefore urgently need fair competitive conditions and a global approach to regulation. Otherwise, the energy and raw material costs in Germany and Europe – which are already high in worldwide comparison – will continue to rise and put the region at even more of a disadvantage. We would then have to reduce or even close production sites in Europe. Instead of exporting, we would import – likely from countries with a worse <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, since the energy and <mark>climate</mark> efficiency standards  are lower in most countries outside of Europe. This does not support <mark>climate</mark> protection.</P><P><STRONG><mark>Climate</mark> protection requires <mark>innovation</mark></STRONG></P><P>Effective global <mark>climate</mark> protection requires <mark>innovation</mark>s. And <mark>innovation</mark>s require a competitive industry which can advance the research and development of energy-efficient products and processes.</P><P>With its products, the chemical industry contributes to saving energy, avoiding emissions and therefore to achieving the greenhouse gas reduction targets. For example, the energy required to heat a single-family house built in the 1960s with an area of 160 m2 can be reduced by around 60% by insulating the exterior walls. In renewable energy generation with wind turbine systems, curing agents and resin systems are decisive for the size and lifespan of the rotor blades and thus for the economic efficiency of the plants.</P><P>Furthermore, the utilization of chemical products over their life cycles avoids many times the amount of <mark>CO2</mark> that was emitted during their production. We need the <mark>innovation</mark>s that come from industry in order to make the transition to renewable energies economically viable and to reduce energy consumption and <mark>CO2</mark> emissions in other sectors, such as construction and transportation. The important role played by industry should be recognized, especially by the G20.</P><P>In addition to the innovative contributions that chemical products are making to <mark>climate</mark> protection, the chemical industry has already made its production extremely efficient. The German chemical industry reduced its emissions by 47% between 1990 and 2014, making it a pioneer in Germany. At <mark>BASF</mark>, we have also accomplished a lot: While we have doubled our sales volumes since 1990, we have been able to cut our greenhouse gas emissions by half in absolute terms and by 75% when measured per metric ton of product. At this level, it becomes more and more challenging to develop new technological options to further avoid <mark>CO2</mark> emissions.</P><P><STRONG>Recommendations of the B20 Taskforce</STRONG></P><P>In the B20 Energy, <mark>Climate</mark> &amp; Resource Efficiency Taskforce, we address these developments and needs, and we focus our recommendations on three core topics:</P><P>First, we call for the establishment of a G20 <mark>Carbon</mark> Pricing Platform to accelerate the development of global pricing mechanisms. The aim is to create a dialogue forum to share experiences with greenhouse gas pricing mechanisms, such as emissions trading.</P><P>Second, we recommend the development of a G20 Energy <mark>Innovation</mark> Action Plan. This would enable governments to create incentives to develop and use innovative technologies, including digital solutions. This could bring about an enormous reduction in emissions.</P><P>And third, we suggest the creation of a G20 Resource Efficiency Platform. Resource efficiency is essential to succeed amid international competition and it can also lead to <mark>sustainable</mark> economic development. The information network proposed by the B20 will strengthen knowledge transfer and collaboration on technological developments and <mark>innovation</mark>s, in order to optimize resource use.</P><P><STRONG>Outlook</STRONG></P><P>And the G20 countries can do even more: At the moment, we are seeing a very volatile political environment. This makes it more difficult for industry to play its key role in <mark>climate</mark> protection and to push forward with the necessary <mark>innovation</mark>s. For companies, it is therefore even more important that the G20 recognizes the key function that industry plays in achieving the <mark>climate</mark> targets set out in the Paris Agreement. The G20 should create a regulatory framework that fosters <mark>innovation</mark> and enables fair competition between industrial companies on a global playing field. Industry will then be able to fully utilize its innovative power and shape <mark>climate</mark> protection in an environmentally friendly, socially responsible and economical way.</P><P>* World Bank (2014)</P></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Policy is one of the strongest motivators for an industry to react to <mark>climate change</mark>. <mark>BASF</mark> has publicly supported and signed COP21’s L’Appel de Paris (Paris Pledge for Action) alongside 800 non-state members.
One recent example of the Chemical’s industry coming together to drive policy change in accordance to <mark>climate change</mark> was realized this past October in Kigali, Rwanda where many companies negotiated into legislature to move away from HCF’s (hydrofluoro<mark>carbon</mark>s). This is a vastly used chemical for refrigeration that is extremely harmful for the environment. The chemical industry was motivated to the legislation given new products that could have not competed with HCF if the legislation was not in place. Legislation in this case has helped chemical companies compete more environmentally friendly <mark>innovation</mark>s. (New York Times, 2016)<STRONG>Making your Yoga Pants Green:</STRONG>
Large volume chemicals, known as Intermediate Chemicals are used by various every day products. These chemicals today are sourced from non-renewable resources. Think of your yoga pants made of Spandex (Lycra). Spandex is primarily made of BDO 1,4. BDO 1,4 has historically been sourced and produced using naphtha or propylene (Figure 2 for Production Pathways to BDO). <mark>BASF</mark> has licensed a new technology to make BDO 1,4 out of dextrose and sugars. This new technology from a company named Genomatica has enabled <mark>BASF</mark> to create an identical renewable chemical.<STRONG>Figure 2: Production Pathways to BDO</STRONG></P><P><mark>BASF</mark> today is the largest producer of BDO. It has an installed global capacity of 650,000 tons/year. With the Genomatica License, <mark>BASF</mark> will be able to produce 50,000 tons / year of renewable BDO.
The benefits of renewable BDO (European Commission: From the Sugar Platform to biofuels and biochemicals, 2015):
1. Cost competitiveness: Competitive at oil prices of $45 / barrel; typically OPEX are 15 – 30% lower than current fossil fuel BDO production
2. CAPEX: Technology is based on fermentation, making the technological process not as capital intensive as other chemical manufacturing sites
3. Greenhouse Gas reduction: Depending on electricity and process the GHG reduction can be around 70 – 117% as compared to non-renewable BDO<STRONG>Success of this technology:</STRONG>
Genomatica has successfully licensed this technology to two major players, <mark>BASF</mark> and Novamont. Novamont has recently opened its first commercial facility with this licensed process, investing over $100 Million Euros. Additionally, Genomatica has produced commercial levels of BDO at the Tate &amp; Lyle facility demonstrating the capabilities of its processes. (Genomatica Press Releases, 2016)<STRONG>Figure 3: Novamont renewable BDO facility</STRONG></P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Conclusions on sustainability, cost and efficiency</STRONG>
Drop in ready renewable chemicals, like renewable BDO 1,4 are a way to reduce greenhouse gases and our dependence on fossil fuel sources for production. We do however have to keep in mind that some renewable feedstock can compete with food sources or be cost prohibitive. For the success of these projects we must invest in R&amp;D that enables cost competitive solutions that do not compete with essential food production. Additionally, to reduce greenhouse gases the efficient use of resources such as electricity, steam and water is extremely important.

It’s developing a process that could cut those emissions in half, making hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles significantly cleaner than electric vehicles in most locations (the environmental benefits of electric cars vary depending on how the electricity is generated). Beyond providing a cleaner source of hydrogen for fuel-cell vehicles, the process could also help clean up industrial processes, like oil refining, that use large amounts of hydrogen.</P><P><mark>BASF</mark> is working on a pilot plant to demonstrate the technology as part of a $30 million project partially financed by the German government. A second part of the project will demonstrate a new way to use <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions as a raw material for chemicals and fuels, by combining them with the hydrogen produced in <mark>BASF</mark>’s low-<mark>carbon</mark> emissions process.</P><P>Taken together, the systems could create new markets for natural gas, especially in the United States, where fracking has led to a boom in production. A cleaner form of hydrogen could also revive stronger interest in fuel-cell vehicles. A handful of automakers have plans to start selling fuel-cell vehicles as early as 2015 (see “<A href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/516711/why-toyota-and-gm-are-pushing-fuel-cell-cars-to-market/"">Why Toyota and GM Are Pushing Fuel-Cell Cars to Market</A>”). Conventional hydrogen production involves reacting methane—the main ingredient of natural gas—with oxygen or water. This reaction produces hydrogen gas and, as the <mark>carbon</mark> reacts with oxygen, <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide.</P><P>Researchers have known for a long time that it’s possible to form hydrogen without introducing oxygen, avoiding <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide production. At high-enough temperatures, methane forms hydrogen and solid <mark>carbon</mark>. (The <mark>carbon</mark> can be used in industrial processes, such as making steel.) But this approach hasn’t proved economical.</P><P>That’s partly because generating high temperatures requires a lot of energy, and producing that energy usually involves <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions, which would offset much of the potential environmental benefit. <mark>BASF</mark> has found better ways to recycle heat within its system, greatly decreasing the amount of energy needed. “The hydrogen production will be cost-competitive, while at the same time having the added advantage of having a reduced <mark>carbon</mark> footprint,” says Andreas Bode, the <mark>BASF</mark> project coordinator.</P><P><mark>BASF</mark> is working with ThyssenKrupp Steel to use the <mark>carbon</mark> produced in the process in steel manufacturing.</P><P>The second part of the project is using the hydrogen to make useful products from <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. In the presence of novel catalysts developed by <mark>BASF</mark>, hydrogen and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide form syngas, a mixture of mostly <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide and hydrogen. Syngas is used to make methanol and other chemicals and fuels. Using hydrogen produced in a way that produces relatively little <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide helps keep overall emissions low. The basic reaction has been known for some time, but <mark>BASF</mark> thinks its new catalysts—the details of which it is keeping to itself—can make it economical. “It’s really a breakthrough,” Bode says.</P><P>Though finding such uses for <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide will do little to dent overall greenhouse gas emissions, the process could be important because it could allow chemical producers to use alternatives to petroleum.</P><DIV class=""callout--tagged-event-promo"" desc=""in-story-promo-mittr-subscribe""><P class=""callout__copy"">Meet the Experts in AI, Robotics and the Economy at EmTech Next.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

These manufacturing systems have enabled impressive economic growth and raised the global standard of living. But as the land, water, and fossil fuel resources those systems rely on become more scarce, biology is offering new ways to engineer solutions.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Synthetic biology redesigns existing organisms for specific purposes to produce safe products that are more efficient, reliable, and predictable. Engineered microorganisms can make many of the same ingredients used in traditional industrialization processes with less energy and waste and without relying on petroleum derivatives. Synthetic biology’s breakthroughs will speed the development of biologically engineered solutions to global problems related to health, materials, energy, and environment. Its approach is multidisciplinary, bringing together biologists, engineers, software developers, chemists, and bioinformatics specialists to understand how genes work together and combine to produce useful applications. Synbio tools make the programming of biology more predictable, more like software.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">This article examines the exciting new tools being developed to solve issues I’ve spent my career tackling. It will give a historic perspective on the use of synbio to produce advanced biofuels and chemicals; look at new bio-based materials, platforms, and food; and examine what is catching investors’ interest now in industrial biotechnology and agriculture.</SPAN></P><H3>Synthetic Biology for Advanced Biofuels</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">My experience with synbio (before it was called that) began at the start of the advanced biofuels industry around 2005. We were trying to get enzymes to cheaply break down cellulose and hemicellulose and to develop microorganisms to process C5 and C6 sugars for the development of advanced biofuels.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">By 2007 government exuberance was pushing technologies and companies too fast. The DOE backed the funding of </SPAN><A href=""http://www.bioenergywiki.net/DOE_Selects_Six_Cellulosic_Ethanol_Plants_for_Up_to_$385_Million_in_Federal_Funding""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">six commercial-scale projects for $385M</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> when the biology was barely off the lab bench and no one had drafted engineering plans. Venture capitalists got excited and put too much money into very early stage companies. This is what VCs do – but in this case they expected the companies to scale and commercialize as quickly as software.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">The companies scaled their technology too quickly, skipping important developmental steps. We realized that after investors put $200M into a company, the company then needed an additional $200M to build its first plant. Then, as if high capital costs and scale-up risk were not harmful enough, when the bottom fell out of the energy market during the recession, it took much of the nascent synbio biofuel industry with it. This was followed by new energy sources and tanking oil prices. Competing with $140/barrel oil was one thing, but $50 was impossible.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Then along came the blend wall and the stalling of the </SPAN><A href=""http://www2.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-program""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Renewable Fuels Standard.</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> The problem here was not in biology – it was a systemic failure that no one saw coming soon enough. Many companies went bankrupt and investors closed their doors.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Today, advanced biofuels technology sits mostly with large, deep-pocketed companies. They have had some successes in building large advanced biofuels plants: Abengoa, DuPont, Poet, Beta Renewables, GranBio. Big, patient companies with other revenue streams can hold and improve the technology until such time as we have policies to support <mark>innovation</mark>. Energy markets are not free markets and don’t properly reward or support <mark>innovation</mark>. Advanced biofuel investors need policy made and maintained by a diverse set of governments. We hope to see such policy agreements come </SPAN><A href=""http://unfccc.int/meetings/paris_nov_2015/meeting/8926.php""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">out of Paris this week.</SPAN></A></P><H3>Pivot to Chemicals</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Challenged by cheap oil, investor fatigue, and technical hurdles, many biofuel companies pivoted to produce alternative chemical products through fermentation. We looked for products with lower costs, lower volume, and higher value, that used biomass and bioprocesses to replace petroleum as the important building block in a number of end products including plastics, lubricants, waxes, and cosmetics.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bio-based platform chemicals are now being produced at small scale mostly above the cost of the petroleum-based products they are trying to replace. These chemicals will be at price parity when we get to large-scale production. During product development and certification, products must be tested and approved throughout the supply chain by chemical producers, product manufacturers, brand owners, retailers, and end consumers. Each stakeholder in the supply chain needs to believe the product shows equal to superior performance. Powerful end users like Coca-Cola with their 20% bio-based bottle are a huge help in pulling product through the chain. They are often willing to pay premium price at the start and can adapt their packaging lines. Each new application of a new or drop-in chemical requires testing and approval that takes time and can’t be rushed by impatient investors. </SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many companies like Amyris and Solazyme are developing ingredients that go into other products, such as flavors and fragrances. As in most biochemical production, the microorganism is removed after fermentation, and at a molecular level, the product is identical to the non-fermented product it is made to replace.</SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Three companies (Solazyme, Amyris, BioAmber) have gone public and are having to deal with being in the public markets. For the most part, the companies are moving ahead, producing products and making good partnership announcements. Their share price does not reflect their advances. A sample of the companies moving forward:</SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Solazyme – produces oils for healthier foods; better home, personal care, and industrial products; and more <mark>sustainable</mark> fuels. Raised $146M + $200M IPO</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Amyris – high-performance renewable products across a range of consumer and industry segments. Raised $417M + $85M IPO</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">BioAmber – biosuccinic acid. Raised $135M + $80M IPO</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Verdezyne – adipic acid and other bio-based chemicals. Raised $67M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Genomatica – butanediol</SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">bio-based chemicals. Raised $113M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Myriant – biosuccinic acid. Raised $110M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Evolva – ingredients for health, wellness, and nutrition such as stevia and vanillin. Raised $28 million. Went public through reverse merger with Arpida.</SPAN></LI></UL><P>Many other companies went into bankruptcy or were purchased (Cobalt, LS9, OPX).</P><H3>Next Wave</H3><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">The collision of digital and biotech has given us tools for faster, cheaper, and better product development. We now have a transformative skill set that allows for quick design, not discovery of new products in a predictable fashion. Biology is becoming more software driven using cloud resources, robots, machine learning, and automation. Development can be done in silico. Costs for doing work continue to go down – for example, the costs and time requirement for gene editing are falling rapidly. Zinc-finger nucleases are costly and can take up to a cost about </SPAN><A href=""http://www.biocompare.com/Editorial-Articles/144186-Genome-Editing-with-CRISPRs-TALENs-and-ZFNs/""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">$3,000 per gene and take up to a year. </SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now, using CRISPR/Cas9, the cost is </SPAN><A href=""http://www.biocompare.com/Editorial-Articles/144186-Genome-Editing-with-CRISPRs-TALENs-and-ZFNs/""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">below $500 per gene</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> for a more accurate process that takes only a week. A genome can now be sequenced for well </SPAN><A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-01-15/illuminas-new-low-cost-genome-machine-will-change-health-care-forever""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">under $10,000 and going lower.</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> These new technologies allow product companies to stay smaller longer without burning as much cash.</SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">These tools are opening up new company and product possibilities. Three areas of interest (outside of pharma) are platform technology companies, industrial biotech, and agriculture.</SPAN></P><H3>Platform technologies</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">I got a front row seat to the early stages of a platform technology company as a pre-Series A board member of Zymergen. These fast-emerging companies are developing technology to support and enable product companies. In the previous generation of biofuel/biochemical companies, R&amp;D had to staff their own microbiologists, buy their own robots, and develop their own bioinformatics systems. They had to engineer and optimize their own microorganisms to make desired products.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now product companies can get superior microbes engineered to order. With more than $100M raised among them this year, Zymergen, Ginkgo Bioworks, Synthace, and Biosyntia are relying on a mix of robotic automation, machine learning, novel software, and high-throughput screening to rapidly develop and optimize new strains to produce industrial chemicals and other bio-based products.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tool-based companies have caught the eye of investors this year: </SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Zymergen – brings scale and efficiency to the process of strain optimization. Raised $44M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gingko Bioworks – built organism-engineering foundry to bring new organisms to customers. Raised $54M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Caribou Biosciences – provides solutions for cellular engineering and analysis based on the CRISPR-Cas9. Raised $14.6M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Intrexon – enables products in the health, food, energy, consumer, and environmental industries using platform technology. Primarily in pharma but active in industrial bio and ag. Raised $344M + $160M IPO ($35/share)</SPAN></LI></UL><H3>Industrial Biotechnology</H3><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many startups are focusing on smaller scale, higher value products that do not compete with petroleum or low-margin commodities. These products require less cap-ex and have lower feedstock exposure due to smaller volumes. New products are more likely to help incumbents, not try to replace them. Here are a few examples of these new companies, their products, and money raised to date:</SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bolt Threads – high-performance fashion fibers. Raised $40M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gingko Bioworks  – flavors / fragrances. Raised $54M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Modern Meadow – cultured leather and meat products. Raised $11M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mango Materials – biodegradable plastics from waste biogas</SPAN></LI></UL><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">An area that has gotten much Silicon Valley investor attention is plant- and fermentation-derived meat, eggs, and dairy replacements. Demand for animal protein is increasing in the developing world, devouring resources and creating waste. The total <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of beef is 4 pounds of greenhouse gases </SPAN><A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/one-hamburger-environment-resources-2015-2""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">per quarter pound of meat,</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> including all the greenhouse gases released during its production.  Although taste and consumer acceptance are going to be challenges, animal protein substitutes are a great way to reduce the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. Some companies are developing plant-based products, while others are fermentation-based:</SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Beyond Meat – animal protein from plant protein. Raised $17M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Impossible Foods – meats and cheeses made from plants. Raised  $183M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Clara Foods – synthetic egg whites from fermentation. Raised $1.75M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Muufri – synthetic milk from fermentation. Raised $2.06M</SPAN></LI></UL><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a mentor at </SPAN><A href=""http://www.indiebio.co/""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">IndieBio</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">, an accelerator for synthetic biology startups, I’ve seen a number of exciting new companies. Many startups are focused on the post-animal bio-economy. Groups are developing organisms to make different kinds of meat, egg and milk proteins, shark fin, and gelatin. These companies have a ways to go and their exits are far from certain. But the new products and technologies will have a positive impact on the environment.    </SPAN></P><H3>Agriculture</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’ve worked for decades to commercialize advanced biotechnology tools for the development of genetically modified crops using </SPAN><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Agrobacterium</SPAN></I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> and similar methods. The new focus is on technologies considered non-transgenic in plants, biocontrol products, and plant nutrition to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and toxic inputs, use less land and water, combat pests, and increase soil fertility.</SPAN></P><P><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Feedstock for 2</SPAN></I><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">nd</SPAN></I><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> gen fuels/chemicals and power</SPAN></I></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">As we continue to expand from hydro<mark>carbon</mark>-based products to carbohydrates, we will need better plant sugars using less water, less land, and fewer inputs. As soon as there is a market pull for $20/ton biomass, there will be companies to provide it, likely using new non-GMO tools to produce better crops faster.</SPAN></P><H3>Gene editing, breeding tools</H3><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">The big six ag companies – <mark>BASF</mark>, Bayer CropScience, Dupont, Dow Chemical Company, Monsanto, and Syngenta – have invested millions of dollars in internal R&amp;D for the commercialization of genetically modified crops. They are unlikely to invest equivalent resources in building new gene editing tools to produce improved non-GMO crops. A number of companies are developing platform technologies to make gene editing faster, quicker, and better. Large seed companies will likely license, partner, and acquire these companies. Two in the forefront are Caribou, with CRISPR technology (raised $14.46M), and Cibus, using gene-editing tools to produce herbicide-resistant crops with other traits and crops on the horizon. To date three US companies are selling crop products that were engineered using gene editing techniques: Cibus – herbicide-resistant canola; Okanagan Specialty Fruits (acquired by Intrexon) – Arctic apples that resist turning brown when sliced or bruised; J. R. Simplot Company – Innate potatoes that resist bruising and produce less potentially</SPAN><A href=""http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">cancer</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">-causing chemical when fried.  Consumer acceptance of the apples and potatoes remains to be seen.</SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regulation of gene editing techniques in crops is still ambiguous, causing some investors to be cautious. The European Commission is debating regulations of the latest techniques, and they may classify plants as GMOs even if they lack foreign DNA. In the United States, modifying plants with </SPAN><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Agrobacterium</SPAN></I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> requires regulation by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, but plants modified by gene editing (ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas based methods) are not currently regulated. In July, the White House launched a multiyear initiative to review federal regulations on agricultural biotechnology so the rules could change. </SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Microbial Solutions: Inoculants, biocontrol, stimulants</SPAN></I></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the beginning of my career, I worked on commercialization of natural biocontrol products produced from sources such as the Neem tree and naturally occurring fungi. We just couldn’t make them financially viable. Now scientists can develop new products to improve crop health by discovering, developing, and altering what naturally occurs in the microbiome of plants and soils. Microbial products are made from microbes that work alone or complement traditional methods of plant production and protection. Products can protect crops from pests and disease, combat resistance, and enhance plant productivity and fertility. Inoculant and biocontrol products can be applied on broad acre crops such as corn and soy, and on fruits and vegetables to help plants take up nutrients and defend against pests, disease, and weeds. </SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Novozymes and Monsanto have formed the BioAg Alliance to catalyze the development of new microbial solutions to address this market. In November, Syngenta and DSM announced a </SPAN><A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-06/syngenta-ties-with-dsm-in-race-for-bacteria-based-crop-products""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">collaboration </SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">that will focus on creating bio-controls, bio-pesticides, and bio-stimulants. A number of smaller companies are developing technologies as well:</SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> AgBiome – researching plant-associated microbiome to discover new biological and trait genes. Raised $34.5M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Symbiota – improve plant health and growth by promoting a healthy microbiome. Raised $7.5M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Agrimetis – natural product-derived compounds to protect crops from weeds, fungal diseases, and insect pests. Raised $7.3M</SPAN></LI></UL><H3>Exits</H3><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">A number of IPOs and acquisitions occurred in the first group of biofuels and biochemical companies with varying degrees of shareholder benefit. I was at Codexis, the first of the group to go public, when we IPOed. Codexis and other early IPO companies have remade themselves a number of times and their value is mostly unrecognized in the public markets. Amyris, Solazyme, Codexis, Gevo, and Metabolix are all trading below $3 a share. REG and Bioamber are trading around $8. Without knowing the financial details, it is unlikely the acquisitions of LS9, OPX, Cobalt, and Verenium were major windfalls for investors. Investment and attitudes will shift for this sector as we develop a price scheme for <mark>carbon</mark> to drive the use of non-petroleum-based products and advanced biofuels.</SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">With all of the seed round and Series A money going into platform, ag, and early-stage biomaterials companies, there is a concern about valuations getting too high and successful routes to exit. Middle-stage capital is missing in this space; medium-size companies have trouble making it to revenues. Raising C or D rounds has been tough. As happens with new asset classes and sectors, most investment firms tracking the industry have yet to build a substantial track record and a route to exit. Private equity firms have played a relatively limited role in the agriculture technology and biomaterials space so far. One of the main reasons is that few of them have been focused on the sector due mostly to the early stage of the companies.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Two examples of acquisitions include Bayer’s $425M acquisition of AgraQuest, the biologicals company, in June 2012 from Otter Capital and Generation Investment Management. In November 2012, <mark>BASF</mark> acquired Becker Underwood, a biological seed treatment, from Norwest Equity Partners for $1.02B. A few IPOs have occurred in the ag space including Marrone Bio <mark>Innovation</mark>s, the biopesticide company, and Arcadia Biosciences, the agriculture traits producer. Marrone is currently trading 80% below its IPO price and Arcadia is 65% below IPO price. Both deals were downsized on low demand and priced below initial share price target range.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Strategic investors like the Big 6 in ag have played a role in building excitement around the sector and its exit potential. Investors outside the industry – giants like Microsoft and Google – could soon become participants and buyers in ag and biomaterials/products. They will make for interesting competitors for incumbents. </SPAN></P><H3>Going Forward</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">We are in the golden age of biology. With the development of exciting new tools, we can engineer plants and microorganisms to make better, cheaper, and unique products. Many of the solutions I have worked on over my career were not financially viable at the time. We now are able to iterate faster and get to market and revenues more quickly with lower costs. It’s why I never say, “I’ve tried that, it didn’t work.” We just didn’t have the right tools yet. We may never get all segments of the population to say the words “<mark>climate change</mark>,” but society is looking for technologies that make us more resilient and adaptable. This change will help lead us to a price scheme on <mark>carbon</mark>, stimulating investment back into advanced biofuels and chemicals. We will adopt new bio-based materials that reduce the demand for protein sources like beef and eggs for a world with more people and fewer resources. Technologies that allow us to produce more food, fuel, and fiber with fewer inputs will make it to market and create shareholder, consumer, and environmental returns.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">In Paris this week the top global leaders announced the launch of “</SPAN><A href=""http://mission-<mark>innovation</mark>.net/""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mission <mark>Innovation</mark></SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">,” a 20-country initiative to accelerate public and private global clean energy <mark>innovation</mark> to address global <mark>climate change</mark>, provide affordable clean energy to consumers, and create additional commercial opportunities in clean energy.

It began in 2016 as an implementation plan for the <A href=""http://investorson<mark>climate</mark>change.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2014_GlobalInvestState_ClimChange_092316.pdf"">Global Investor Statement on <mark>Climate Change</mark></A>, a statement signed by 409 investors in the months before the Paris Agreement was finalized in 2016.</P><P>A steering committee including representatives from all 225 investors put together the list of 100 greenhouse gas emitting companies including agricultural input suppliers Bayer, <mark>BASF</mark>, and Dow Chemical along with global food powers Pepsico and Nestle. Australian conglomerate WesFarmers also made the list of target companies. WesFarmers owns several major food retailers in Australia including 300 Target stores in the country as well as selling agricultural inputs.</P><P>“Moving 100 of the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to align their business plans with the goals of the Paris Agreement will have considerable ripple effects. Our collaborative engagements with the largest emitters will spur actions across all sectors as companies work to avoid being vulnerable to <mark>climate</mark> risk and left behind,” said Anne Simpson, investment director of sustainability at California Public Employees’ Retirement System (Calpers), one of the participant investors, in a statement.</P><P>The list of companies was developed using data from CDP’s (formerly the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project) emissions data. Noticeably no major meat companies or feed suppliers ended up on the final list of 100 target companies.</P><P>The investors have committed to pressure these 100 companies to enact stronger corporate governance, reduce greenhouse emissions across the supply chain, and provide more information to shareholders of <mark>climate</mark>-related financial risks.</P><P>The Paris Agreement was dealt a blow this year when US President Donald Trump announced that the US would pull out of the agreement in June. However, French President Emmanuel Macron said in an <A href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42322968"">interview yesterday</A> that he believes Trump will bring the US back into the deal soon.</P><P>“To support the full implementation of the Paris Agreement it is also vital that investors and universal owners across the mainstream investment community do more to ensure major corporate emitters move swiftly to address the risks and pursue the opportunities presented by <mark>climate change</mark>,” said  Stephanie Maier, director of responsible investment at HSBC Global Asset Management in a statement.</P><P>All of the food and agriculture companies targeted by the initiative have public <mark>climate change</mark> policies.</P><P><A href=""https://www.nestle.com/csv/planet/<mark>climate</mark>-change"">Nestle</A> provides the most specific public goals, pledging to reduce emissions per tonne of product by 35% overall by 2020, compared to 2010. The company has also set the goal of reducing emissions in distribution operations and warehouses by 10% by 2020, compared to 2014.</P><P><A href=""https://www.bayer.com/en/response-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change-straightforward.aspx"">Bayer</A> has pledged to cut its “specific emissions” of greenhouse gases by 20% by 2020, compared to  2015 emissions.</P><P><A href=""https://www.<mark>basf</mark>.com/en/company/sustainability/environment/energy-and-<mark>climate</mark>-protection/<mark>climate</mark>-protection-goals.html""><mark>BASF</mark></A> has publicized the goal of reducing “specific greenhouse gas emissions” per metric ton of product by 40% by 2020, using 2002 levels as a baseline. The company claims to have reached a 37.2% reduction by 2016.</P><P><A href=""https://www.dow.com/en-us/science-and-sustainability/2025-sustainability-goals/leading-the-blueprint"">Dow Chemical</A> has no specific public goals for decreasing its own emissions but says it intends to “lead through performance and thought leadership to promote energy and greenhouse gas emissions performance policies, best practices and standards, and will participate in clean energy development and use.”</P><P><A href=""http://www.pepsico.com/sustainability/<mark>climate</mark>-change"">Pepsico</A> has an expressed goal of reducing “absolute” greenhouse emissions by 2030.</P><P>These companies are on the target lists despite these claims.

But should environmental measures be allowed to harm the economy?</P></DIV></DIV><B>SPIEGEL:</B> Mr. Hambrecht, to reduce the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel is calling for the &quot;fundamental transformation of industrial society.&quot; Have you already embarked on this transformation at <mark>BASF</mark>, the world's largest chemical corporation?<P><B>Hambrecht:</B> A corporation that competes internationally must change constantly, but in three dimensions, only one of which is environmental protection. Economic efficiency and social sustainability are also part of the mix. After all, I am responsible for 95,000 employees and their families.</P><P><B>SPIEGEL:</B> There are, of course, conflicts among these three dimensions.</P><P><B>Hambrecht:</B> Yes, but one thing is clear: I cannot reach the other objectives without economic success.</P><P><B>SPIEGEL:</B> Is Gabriel's demand too one-sided, in your opinion?</P><P><B>Hambrecht:</B> Mr. Gabriel is like a whirlwind. He chases the cloud across the land, but he doesn't really care where the wind is coming from, just that it blows strongly. What Mr. Gabriel is asking for is a pipe dream. I would like to know whether he even supports Germany as a site for industrial production. What does he want? The transformation of industry into a service economy? Then he should say so.</P><P><B>SPIEGEL:</B> Will you give voice to this criticism at the next energy summit on July 3, when you and other corporate leaders will meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other government officials?</P><DIV class=""asset-box asset-html-box""><DIV class=""asset-title"">From the Magazine</DIV><DIV><P><A href=""/international/spiegel-rights-reprints-and-other-usages-a-460322.html"" title=""SPIEGEL Rights, Reprints and other Usages"" class=""text-link lp-text-link-int article-icon article-en""><SPAN class=""asset-headline-intro"">Find out how you can reprint this DER SPIEGEL article in your publication.</SPAN></A></P></DIV></DIV><B>Hambrecht:</B> Of course. We cannot continue along the current trajectory. Everything is currently determined by environmental policy, but an energy policy worth its salt doesn't exist. Where do we stand on nuclear power? Will coal have a future in Germany? These are questions we must urgently discuss. Instead, politicians are constantly setting new, unrealistic goals.<P><B>SPIEGEL:</B> Such as?</P><P><B>Hambrecht:</B> Mr. Gabriel wants to increase annual growth in energy productivity from one to three percent.</P><P><B>SPIEGEL:</B> What's wrong with that?</P><P><B>Hambrecht:</B> Energy productivity must indeed be increased, but three percent is a completely unrealistic target.</P><P><B>SPIEGEL:</B> How does the government arrive at three percent?</P><P><B>Hambrecht:</B> By simple arithematic. The coalition agreement calls for doubling energy productivity in Germany from 1990 to 2020. In reality, however, it has only grown by 0.9 percent per year in recent years. This means that we would need three percent to reach the target, which is completely unrealistic. We're already on the cutting edge when it comes to efficiency, together with Japan.</P><P><B>SPIEGEL:</B> Gabriel has presented an eight-point plain with which he claims the three percent goal is achievable.</P><P><B>Hambrecht:</B> The plan is outrageous. For example, it calls for an &quot;an increase in efficiency in transportation and an increase in the share of biofuels to 17 percent.&quot; The minister doesn't seem to know what he's talking about. A share of only 10 percent would require the use of up to a third of current agricultural acreage in Germany.</P><DIV class=""js-module-box-image box-position asset-align-left"" style=""width:180px;""><DIV class=""article-image-description article-description-background""><DIV class=""asset-credit"">DER SPIEGEL</DIV><P><mark>BASF</mark> is the world's biggest chemical company.</P></DIV></DIV><B>SPIEGEL:</B> Brazil plans to grow plants for biodiesel on a large scale.<P><B>Hambrecht:</B> None of this is as easy as it seems, and certainly not on a global scale. Growing plants to produce biofuels competes with food production and also requires a lot of energy and water. Either way, it won't be feasible without genetic engineering and genetically modified crops.</P><P><B>SPIEGEL:</B> The use of biofuels is only one of eight points in Gabriel's program.</P><P><B>Hambrecht:</B> The next one gets me even more fired up: &quot;Reduction of emissions of other greenhouse gases, such as methane.&quot; Methane! Who produces methane? Cows, sheep and goats. If we could break Germany's entire livestock population of the habit of eating and digesting, we would save only 18 million tons, instead of the 40 million Mr. Gabriel wants. We shouldn't be dreaming. We need more candor!</P><P><B>SPIEGEL:</B> You are considered one of Merkel's key advisors. What does she say about your allegations?</P><P><B>Hambrecht:</B> We must help the chancellor at the energy summit. But more reasonable views are gradually taking hold -- finally. New scenarios are being calculated.</P><P><B>SPIEGEL:</B> The chancellor portrays herself on the international stage as someone anxious to protect the <mark>climate</mark>. Shouldn't Germany be setting an example in this respect?</P><P><B>Hambrecht:</B> Ambitious goals are a good thing, but we must be realistic. I am opposed to our going it alone as a country, which would be detrimental to our competitiveness.</P><P><B>SPIEGEL:</B> The energy summit planned for the beginning of July is already expected to issue recommendations. What do you expect?</P><DIV class=""js-module-box-image box-position asset-align-left"" style=""width:180px;""><DIV class=""article-image-description article-description-background""><DIV class=""asset-credit"">DPA</DIV><P><mark>BASF</mark> CEO Jürgen Hambrecht is skeptical about Germany's energy productivity goals as laid out by Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel.</P></DIV></DIV><B>Hambrecht:</B> All discrepancies must be discussed openly, and then we must agree on which initial conditions should go into the joint final analysis. It is only on this sort of joint basis that we can issue recommendations capable of enduring in the future.<P><B>SPIEGEL:</B> And if you don't achieve this?</P><P><B>Hambrecht:</B> Then certain individuals will probably no longer attend these meetings in the future.</P><P><B>SPIEGEL:</B> Will you be one of them?</P><P><B>Hambrecht:</B> It's possible.</P><P><B>SPIEGEL:</B> You say that what the government is calling for is completely unrealistic. What is realistic?</P><P><B>Hambrecht:</B> Realistic is what is doable without harming the economy. Otherwise we will be solving supposed problems by de-industrializing Germany. We are one of the few Western economies that still has a large, well-functioning system of industrial production. If politicians no longer want energy-intensive companies in Germany they should be honest about it.</P><P><B>SPIEGEL:</B> No one wants to drive out industry. But why shouldn't there be other ways to increase energy efficiency?</P><P><B>Hambrecht:</B> Industry has already done a great deal on its own in the past, including adherence to substantial voluntary obligations. And we will continue to do a lot in the future. But we have already moved far up the learning curve. <mark>Climate</mark> protection that doesn't make sense economically translates into the loss of jobs to other countries.</P></DIV><DIV class=""multi-pager-control clearfix""><UL class=""list-float clearfix""><LI class=""list-float-left""><SPAN class=""is-active"">1</SPAN></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Through this partnership, the two organizations will establish a multi-stakeholder DSR Consortium and further research on the use of non-genetically modified, herbicide-tolerant rice.</P><P>Under optimal conditions, direct seeding is considered a more efficient and cheaper method of growing rice than manual rice transplantation.

The concept of Siemens was not to desalinate seawater by means of energy-intensive heating and vaporizing processes, but by channeling water through an electric field.

			Most farmers in north-east Thailand, where there is a shortage of water resources, rely on rainfall.  As a consequences, harvests can fluctuate greatly depending on meteorological conditions.  The development of weather index insurance requires highly reliable long-term meteorological data.  Khon Kaen Province has relatively precise meteorological weather stations, making it a suitable target for product development.  Insurance coverage as well as penetration rates are low - Thai farmers are unfamiliar with insurance and struggle to pay back loans taken for agricultural equipment.  In response, Sompo Japan decided to develop a new scheme to sell an insurance product with loans from Thailand's Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC).  Between April and June 2008, Sompo Japan made a trial product, prepared fliers in Thai for the product, and conducted interviews with local farmers.  BAAC expects the product to succeed;  in May 2009, a simulation for full-scale product development was started and Sompo Japan is preparing to launch the product in 2010.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE cellpadding=""7"" class=""unfccc_table"" style=""width:100%""><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG>Suntory: Conserving water resources</STRONG></P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P><A href=""http://www.suntory.com/""><STRONG>Suntory Limited</STRONG></A>is making the conservation of water resources the axis of their environmental activities in line with their corporate message &quot;Water for Life, Suntory&quot;.  Suntory are carrying out work to protect water sources and forests (&quot;Forests of Natural Water&quot;) focused on the forests that serves as sources of water for their plants in cooperation with national and regional administrations across Japan.  The company has opened the Suntory School of Forest and Water to provide environmental eduction for elementary school children.  In addition to these activities, the company also has a long-running &quot;Save the birds&quot; campaign and is supporting bird conservation through a designated fund.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE cellpadding=""7"" class=""unfccc_table"" style=""width:100%""><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG>Thames Water: Adaptating business operations</STRONG></P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P><A href=""http://www.thameswater.co.uk/"">Thames Water</A>are adapting to the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> as part of core business strategy.  Thames Water's <A href=""http://www.thameswater.co.uk/cps/rde/xchg/SID-59B52569-D22B4A07/corp/hs.xsl/5372.htm"">Strategic Direction Statement </A><A href=""http://www.thameswater.co.uk/cps/rde/xchg/SID-59B52569-D22B4A07/corp/hs.xsl/5372.htm"">(SDS)</A> outlines how Thames Water will respond to a wide range of issues including <mark>climate change</mark>, leakage and improving water efficiency whilst delivering high quality customer service from 2010 to 2035.  The SDS was a culmination of Thames Water's largest-ever public consultation exercise, which included discussion groups with customers, stakeholder workshops, interviews with MPs and an online consultation, prompting over 2,600 individual comments.  The SDS has identified three main areas for action between 2010 and 2015:</P><OL><LI><P><STRONG>Water Resources - </STRONG><mark>climate change</mark> has been specifically taken into account through headroom.</P></LI><LI><P><STRONG>Sewerage/Sewer Flooding</STRONG> - improve the understanding of catchments and <mark>climate change</mark> with respect to sewer flooding between 2010 and 2015.

Conventional breeders and genetic engineers are both trying to make arabica coffee plants more robust.</DIV><DIV class=""credit"">Credit: Coffee World Research</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Mark Dunhill, CEO of English coffee, tea, and cocoa retailer Whittard of Chelsea, is obsessed with sourcing the finest ingredients. His kitchen brims with parcels of dark chocolate and tea caddies full of exotic varieties.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>But Dunhill’s even bigger obsession appears to be coffee. Every 10 days, a silver pouch packed with freshly grown and roasted coffee beans arrive from countries such as Guatemala, Tanzania and the Congo. He carefully weighs and grinds the beans before pouring them into an espresso machine that hisses as it delivers <A href=""https://cen.acs.org/articles/91/i5/Caffeine-Jitters.html"" title=""Caffeine Jitters"">caffeine</A>-powered perfection.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>For Dunhill, as for most of the world’s billion or so coffee drinkers, coffee has to be made with beans from <I>Coffea arabica</I>—a shrub discovered hundreds of years ago in the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia—or not at all. To switch to the bitter beans of <I>C. canephora</I>, also known as robusta, would be anathema.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>“Arabica beans provide a radically different and infinitely more pleasurable drinking experience,” Dunhill says. Robusta is typically relegated to instant coffee.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Unfortunately for the <A href=""https://cen.acs.org/articles/91/i13/Appreciating-Coffee.html"" title=""Appreciating Coffee"">coffee world</A>, arabica is also genetically predisposed for extinction. Cultivated arabica plants have a genetic diversity of just 1.2%, compared with more than 20% for crops such as rice and soy, making it less able to adapt to changing conditions. And it is a fragile, weakling of a variety that is susceptible to disease, including coffee leaf rust caused by the fungus <I>Hemileia vastatrix,</I> and pests such as the coffee borer beetle.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Compounding the problem, <mark>climate change</mark> in coffee-growing areas is forecast to increase stress on arabica, making it more vulnerable to pests and disease.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Stirred to action, coffee producers are working to protect arabica by crossbreeding it with more resilient <I>Coffea</I> varieties. But a debate on the rescue plan is heating up, with some scientists criticizing crossbreeding for being slow and inaccurate. They say genetic modification is the best way to ensure arabica does not go the way of the Gros Michel, a tasty species of banana wiped out by a fungus in the mid-20th century.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Coffee breeders reject this notion as well as any increased reliance on pesticides. They are counting on crossbreeding and better farming techniques to ensure arabica’s survival.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Time isn’t on arabica’s side. A leaf rust epidemic that began around 2008 wiped out large tracts of production across Central America. As long ago as 1890, rust killed off most of the arabica plants in Sri Lanka, until then a major coffee supplier to the U.K. It forced Sri Lankan growers to start growing tea, a move that is widely believed to have turned England into the nation of tea drinkers it is today.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>According to research published by London’s Royal Botanic Gardens last year in the journal <I>Nature Plants</I> (2017, <A href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nplants.2017.81"" title=""10.1038/nplants.2017.81"">DOI: 10.1038/nplants.2017.81</A>), <mark>climate change</mark> will make up to 60% of the growing land in Ethiopia—a major supplier—unsuitable for coffee cultivation by the end of the century.</P></DIV><DIV class=""htmljswidget section""><DIV style=""background-color: #e5efc1; width: 40%; float: left; padding: 10px; margin: 6px 10px 6px 2px;""><DIV style=""color: #618724; font-size: 20px; margin: 2px 0px;""><B>Spilling the beans on <I>Coffea arabica</I></B></DIV><P>Drugs in the news over the past five years offer case histories on medical break- throughs, research shortcomings, regulatory uncertainties, and pricing mayhem.</P><P><B><SPAN style=""color: #618724;"">▸</SPAN> 5.8 million metric tons:</B> Production in 2017<B><SPAN style=""color: #618724;"">▸</SPAN> 1.2%:</B> Arabica’s genetic diversity<B><SPAN style=""color: #618724;"">▸</SPAN> 15%:</B> Share of production lost to rust<B><SPAN style=""color: #618724;"">▸</SPAN> 10–14 days:</B> Time it takes for rust to appear after first infection.<B><SPAN style=""color: #618724;"">▸</SPAN> 1990:</B> Year coffee leaf rust became a global problem<B><SPAN style=""color: #618724;"">▸</SPAN> 40%:</B> Share of Colombia’s coffee crop wiped out in 2008 by rust<B><SPAN style=""color: #618724;"">▸</SPAN> 3 billion:</B> Number of trees Colombian growers have had to replant since 2008.</P><P><B>Sources:</B> The American Phytopathological Society, International Coffee Organization, London’s Royal Botanic Gardens.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Across the world, arabica crops are already being “chased up the hillside” to cooler climes, says World Coffee Research, an organization set up in 2012 by coffee producers to protect and enhance supplies of quality coffee. WCR has since begun a program to breed a resilient variety of arabica. Coffee retailers such as Starbucks have also introduced programs to breed arabica with greater disease resistance.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>WCR is working with experts around the world to identify wild arabica relatives in Ethiopia, or varieties maintained in agricultural institutes, that resist disease such as rust and crossbreed them with the weakling varieties we get our coffee beans from today.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>The group has already created 46 arabica hybrids designed for enhanced resistance to fungal diseases and is now testing them in the field. It plans to introduce the best performers commercially in 2023.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>WCR’s scientific director, Christophe Montagnon, acknowledges that the main focus is disease resistance and that heat tolerance won’t be bred into arabica soon.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>“It is very unlikely that we find now the very plant that will be necessary in 2050. We are improving the coffee populations step-by-step,” Montagnon says.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>But the crossbreeding advocated by Montagnon is not just slow but also somewhat clumsy, according to some scientists. “They are basically trying to breed a racehorse with a donkey. And it takes many, many years of backcrossing to get rid of the donkey,” says Brande Wulff, crop genetics project leader for the U.K.’s John Innes Centre, whose grandfather happened to be a tea grower in Sri Lanka.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Genetic engineering is a quicker and more effective alternative to crossbreeding for heat tolerance and disease resistance, Wulff argues. “With genetic modification, you can go to the wild relatives, identify resistance genes that matter, take them out with molecular tweezers, and stick them straight into your elite material to clinically combine the best of both worlds,” he says.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Lessons already learned from applying genetic engineering to other plant species should be transferable to arabica, Wulff suggests. “Resistance genes are like eyes that see the presence of the pathogen, and when they detect a pathogen, they can turn on defense mechanisms,” he says.</P></DIV><DIV class=""articlemedia parbase section""><DIV id=""cen-09607-bus2-curst-gr2"" style=""width:704px"" class=""article_image_box no_border bottomMargin""><DIV class=""article_border""><DIV><DIV id=""media_modal_cen-09607-bus2-curst-gr2"" class=""media_modal_image""><DIV class=""imagePopup""><DIV class=""description"">Arabica plants struggle against fungus, as seen here, and against rising temperatures.</DIV><DIV class=""credit"">Credit: Coffee Buyers Club</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""article_image_text""><DIV class=""text"">
Arabica plants struggle against fungus, as seen here, and against rising temperatures.</DIV><DIV class=""credit"">Credit: Coffee Buyers Club</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Techniques such as CRISPR can be used to change a single or a few base pairs of DNA, but Wulff says traditional genetic engineering approaches are required to incorporate a full resistance gene, which is typically 30–100 DNA base pairs long.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>A fungus might generate millions of spores, of which just one has a mutation that enables it to overcome a plant’s resistance. Two resistance genes would reduce the probability of the pathogen’s success to one in 1 trillion. Each new resistance gene can increase the odds against the pathogen’s success 1 million times. “If you introduce a stack of five genes, it should be durable for 100 years,” Wulff says.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>The cost of cloning disease-resistance genes has tumbled in recent years and now stands at roughly $70,000 per gene. And the work could be done in a few months. “So it is becoming much more affordable to clone these agronomically important genes,” Wulff says.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>University of California, Davis, researchers brought genetically modifying arabica coffee a step closer to reality in early 2017 when they released the genome sequence for the plant. “This new genome sequence for <I>C. arabica</I> contains information crucial for developing high-quality, disease-resistant coffee varieties that can adapt to the <mark>climate change</mark>s,” said UC Davis geneticist Juan Medrano, researcher on the sequencing effort, at the time of the publication.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>But WCR, which has the backing of more than 30 coffee-producing organizations, maintains that genetic modification is not an option. “The coffee world and story is not yet compatible with genetic modification,” Montagnon says diplomatically. Indeed, at this time there is no genetically modified coffee on sale anywhere in the world and no major plan under way to introduce it.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Wulff admits that genetically modified coffee would face social and regulatory challenges. The big agricultural companies are the only ones that can afford the multi-million-dollar regulatory costs required to bring such a product to market, he says.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>In the absence of genetic modification, three of the world’s biggest agrochemical firms—<mark>BASF</mark>, Bayer, and Syngenta—say they have pesticides and other technologies that will protect arabica.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Syngenta has introduced NuCoffee, a package of services that support best practices in coffee cultivation, including pesticide-use protocols. The approach is leading to significantly higher yields for coffee crops, says Daniel Bachner, a senior crop protection executive at Syngenta in Brazil.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Meanwhile, <mark>BASF</mark> says it has begun offering coffee producers a variety of the mineral kaolin, which forms a dusty coating that puts off pests while also protecting against sunburn and keeping plant canopies cooler. Named Surround, the material doubles bean yields in coffee bushes, according to Peter Barrows, international business director for <mark>BASF</mark> subsidiary TKI.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P><mark>BASF</mark> is also targeting leaf rust with an array of pesticides. “We are planning to launch a host of new products across all indications by the end of the decade,” <mark>BASF</mark> says. One example is Revysol, a triazole-based antifungal that the firm hopes will be its next blockbuster fungicide.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>WCR isn’t fond of these approaches either. “I don’t believe the solution is in pesticides,” Montagnon says. “I believe—and other scientists do—that we should be looking more at plant health.” Good use of fertilizer and farming practices such as promoting shade can be more efficient than the use of pesticides to protect rust-susceptible coffee plants, he argues.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Montagnon points to studies, including one being undertaken by Jacques Avelino, a plant pathologist at the French agricultural research institute CIRAD. According to Avelino, who has been studying coffee cultivation for 30 years and is an adviser to WCR, farming practices that promote shading of arabica bushes can be highly effective at reducing rust and other diseases.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Scientists like Wulff warn that farming improvements and crossbreeding, however well meaning, could fail to fight off <mark>climate change</mark>, pests, and disease. Consumers will then be forced to make a choice: Either switch to bitter robusta or wake up and smell the genetically modified coffee.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>But Montagnon, who himself has 28 years of experience in breeding coffee plants and has published more than 100 articles on the subject, is confident that a combination of crossbreeding and better farming practices is the best way of ensuring arabica’s survival.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>He’s also confident this approach will produce the exquisite-tasting coffee that consumers demand. Whittard’s Dunhill, among others, will be hoping that Montagnon is right and that shiny pouches of freshly roasted arabica beans will drop onto his doormat for years to come.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""clear""> </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Being in this position since 2012 he is responsible for <mark>BASF</mark>s sustainability strategy, the implementation into the business activities and decision making processes as well as sustainability stakeholder relation management. He is also heading the eco-efficiency analysis and sustainability evaluations.</P><P>In 1994 Dirk Voeste graduated with a Ph.D. in biotechnology and agricultural botany from University Bonn in Germany and a M.Phil. in Post Harvest Technology from the Cranfield Institute of Technology in England. After his studies he was the responsible scientist for the development of a closed equilibrated aquatic ecosystem in cooperation with NASA, USA. Since 1998 he has held various positions in the field of biotechnology, breeding and crop protection. Dirk joined <mark>BASF</mark> SE in 2001. He previously held responsibilities in research as well as in global marketing functions. Among others he was Head of Sustainability and Product Stewardship for the Crop Protection Division.</P><P><STRONG>AccountAbility (AA): <mark>BASF</mark> is an industry leader in stakeholder engagement practices. What role did social media play in terms of sustainability practices more generally?</STRONG></P><P>Dirk Voeste (DV): For <mark>BASF</mark>, social media is an integral part of innovative two-way communications. With its growing impact, social media provides an opportunity to intensify customer contacts and appeal to new target and stakeholder groups. <mark>BASF</mark> also aims to increase the company’s profile and strengthen the <mark>BASF</mark> brand. Ultimately, social media helps us implement our corporate strategy “We create chemistry for a <mark>sustainable</mark> future.” We put great emphasis on storytelling with concrete examples from a variety of perspectives and on our material strategic topics.</P><P><STRONG>AA: <mark>BASF</mark> has updated and enhanced the approach for evaluating suppliers in terms of sustainability. Could you please elaborate on the value generated by this initiative? </STRONG></P><P>DV: Our supply chain management aims to strengthen our suppliers’ awareness of our standards and expectations and shape their contribution to <mark>sustainable</mark> development in a transparent manner.</P><P>It is important for us that our suppliers adhere to environmental, social, and corporate governance standards. Further to our Supplier Code of Conduct which outlines <mark>BASF</mark>’s expectations on social and environmental compliance, we also provided employee training on sustainability-oriented supplier management to enhance our global supply chain management, reaching almost 750 employees last year.</P><P><mark>BASF</mark> also participates in the “Together for Sustainability” (TfS) initiative of leading chemical companies for the global standardization of supplier evaluation and auditing. This initiative aims at developing and implementing a global program for the responsible supply of goods and services and improving suppliers’ environmental and social standards.</P><P>Risk matrices relating to country and product risks are also helping us identify suppliers with a high sustainability risk potential. If we discover a need for improvement, we support our suppliers in taking measures to fulfill our standards. If we cannot find any improvement after a defined timeframe, we may terminate the business relationship.</P><P><STRONG>AA: <mark>BASF</mark> is a co-founder of the American Chemistry Council’s (ACC) Responsible Care Initiative. Could you please elaborate on how the Responsible Care Management System (RCMS) generates a business advantage for <mark>BASF</mark>?</STRONG></P><P>DV: As co-founder of the Responsible Care Global Charter in 2006, we set ambitious goals for environmental and health protection, safety and security to drive improvement. <mark>BASF</mark> implemented our Responsible Care Management System (RCMS) in 2007, which applies to all <mark>BASF</mark> Group companies as well as those companies in which we hold a majority share. <mark>BASF</mark>’s RCMS comprises the global rules, standards and procedures for environmental and health protection, safety and security for the various stations along our value chain. Our regulations cover the transportation of raw materials, the activities at our sites and warehouses, the distribution of our products and our customers’ application of the products. We regularly conduct audits to monitor our performance and progress, and use the findings from these audits to drive continuous improvement.</P><P>Fostering awareness of workplace safety and safe behavior in every individual is a key component of our worldwide safety initiatives. We assess risks in all areas ranging from research and production to logistics, and how these risks could affect the environment and surrounding community, as well as our employees.</P><P><STRONG>AA: What role do partnerships play in pushing <mark>BASF</mark>’s sustainability agenda further? What are some of the strengths and limitations of your partnerships?</STRONG></P><P>DV: Aspects of sustainability are often part of broader, complex frameworks that are relevant not only globally, but very often at the regional or local level. For example, cooperating along the value chain with our suppliers and customers is a pre-requisite to improving our contribution to sustainability. In order to promote societal acceptance for our business activities, we engage in ongoing dialogue with a large group of stakeholders including customers, employees, shareholders, neighbors, workers’ representatives, politicians, NGOs, media and business partners.</P><P>This open exchange helps identify sustainability issues and improvement potentials at an early stage so we can take appropriate measures to limit business losses; at the same time, it lays the foundation for identifying market opportunities and turning them into product solutions.</P><P><STRONG>AA: What do you feel are the two or three key issues where <mark>BASF</mark> can really make a difference for its stakeholders?</STRONG></P><P>DV: Based on our portfolio, we have identified three global megatrends where we can make a strong contribution to <mark>sustainable</mark> development: 1) Resources, environment &amp; <mark>climate</mark>; 2) Food &amp; nutrition and 3) Quality of life. To maximize our potential in these three areas and enhance the long-term success of our customers, we are fostering R&amp;D and <mark>innovation</mark> in more <mark>sustainable</mark> products and solutions. We invest around one-third of our total R&amp;D expenditure – which in 2013 reached a record €1.8 billion – on projects aimed at increasing energy efficiency and <mark>climate</mark> protection.</P><P><STRONG>AA: What would you say <mark>BASF</mark> is doing differently in the sustainability space compared to your competitors?</STRONG></P><P>DV: Through the “We create chemistry” strategy established in 2011, <mark>BASF</mark> is placing an even stronger emphasis on its contribution to current and future sustainability needs. We strive for increased sustainability not as an end in itself but because this is also key to our long-term business success.</P><P>With innovative solutions we can differentiate ourselves in the marketplace while also helping solve the world’s most pressing environmental and social challenges. Developing our company in line with our corporate purpose requires us to explore business value while at the same time managing risks. To achieve this, we conduct an intense and open dialogue with a broad range of stakeholder groups.</P><P>If we consider our new “<mark>Sustainable</mark> Solution Steering” method, our portfolio evaluation has a very high level of transparency compared to peers in our industry. For example, we communicate on product applications which we identified as “challenged”, meaning those which raise sustainability concerns and for which we are currently developing action plans for improvement.</P><P><STRONG>AA: Can you please elaborate on your strategic principles to </STRONG><STRONG>align your business more closely with your customers’ sustainability needs? </STRONG></P><P>DV: We want to offer products that meet our customers’ sustainability needs throughout the entire life cycle.

&lt;p&gt;The degree of air leakage or air infiltration a building has. Making a building airtight essentially means eliminating draughts. Ideally we want to have total control over how much air we're letting in to the building through designed ventilation systems, rather than cold air entering (and warm air escaping) uncontrolled through unwanted or unseen gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airtightness is typically measured in two units: air changes per hour (ACH) and air permeability (m3/hr/m2). For a typical building, there is usually little difference in the two figures. The smaller the airtightness figure the better. Under Irish building regulations new homes must have an air-tightness of 10 m3/hr/m2. The rigorous Passivhaus standard demands an airtightness of 0.6ACH or less.&lt;/p&gt;

This can cause heat to escape from the building or cold to enter. Thermal bridging occurs when a thermally conductive material (ie a material with low resistance to heat flow) can penetrate or bypass the insulation layer. For example, insulation is often placed between timber joists in roofs, however the joists themselves may conduct heat and reduce the effectiveness of the insulation by acting as a thermal bridge along which heat can be transferred out and lost. Thermal bridging can greatly reduce the effectiveness of insulation, so it's crucial to minimise thermal bridges during the design of a new build or refurbishment.&lt;/p&gt;"" data-tiptheme=""tipthemeflatdarklight"" data-tipdelayclose=""500"" data-tipeventout=""mouseout"" data-tipmouseleave=""false"" data-tipcontent=""html"" class=""jqeasytooltip jqeasytooltip140"" id=""jqeasytooltip140"" title=""Thermal bridges"">thermal bridges</A></SPAN>,” said a statement from <mark>BASF</mark>.</P><P><mark>BASF</mark> Elastospray LWP delivers simple and fast installation, high compressive strength, and water vapour permeability.</P><P>In its bid to curb <mark>climate change</mark>, the European Union is aiming to drastically reduce the use of fluorinated gases (F-gases) with high global warming potential (GWP).

</P><UL><LI>
		close to 0.5°C warmer than the average September from 1981-2010;

	Averaging over twelve-month periods smooths out the shorter-term variations. Globally, the twelve-month average from October 2016 to September 2017 is 0. 54°C above the 1981-2010 average. This is the second warmest, non-overlapping, twelve-month period on record and follows the warmest twelve-month period on record from October 2015 to September 2016, which had a temperature 0.64°C above average. 2016 is by far the warmest calendar year on record: its global temperature of 0.62°C above the average for 1981-2010 compares with the value of 0.44°C for 2015, the next warmest calendar year.
</P><P>
	The spread in the global averages from various temperature datasets has been unusually large in 2016 and 2017, due to differences in the extent to which datasets represent the relatively warm conditions that have predominated over both the Arctic and the Antarctic. Spread is also large for the years 2005 and 2006, for which the values presented here are relatively high and likely to be reduced when production of an updated dataset has been completed. Nevertheless, there is general agreement between datasets regarding:
</P><UL><LI>
		the exceptional warmth of 2016, and to a lesser extent 2015;
	</LI><LI>
		the overall rate of warming since the late 1970s;
	</LI><LI>
		the sustained period of above-average temperatures from 2001 onwards.
	</LI></UL><P>
	There is more variability in average European temperatures, but values are less uncertain because observational coverage of the continent is relatively dense. Twelve-month averages for Europe were at a high level from 2014 to 2016. They have fallen over the past twelve months, but remain well above the 1981-2010 average. The warmest twelve-month period occurred from July 2006 to June 2007.

The DriveNow app launched in London in late December 2014 but has since expanded to Stockholm and Copenhagen, Denmark, as well as a number of cities in Germany, <mark>BMW</mark>’s home country. Partnering with another app will expand <mark>BMW</mark>’s reach and emphasize its environmental awareness to like-minded consumers.“DriveNow’s on-demand car sharing service was always designed to provide city dwellers with another flexible way of getting around, sitting alongside things like public transport, taxis and Boris Bikes rather than replacing them,” said Joseph Seal Driver, director of DriveNow UK. “By partnering with Moovit and integrating DriveNow’s fleet of 290 cars into the app, we’re now helping people to compare every transport option in London at the click of the button.”
As the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> make themselves visible and scientists warn of future damages, the socially minded consumer has looked for ways to minimize her <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. Because of the impact of automobiles on the environment, ride-sharing services have emerged as a popular way of combating <mark>climate change</mark>.
The ride-sharing consumer skews young, so automobile purchase rates have consequently dropped among millennials. As such, automakers hoping to appeal to recent and upcoming luxury consumers have invested in mobility services and electric vehicles with the hopes of attracting young consumers.
With the partnership, Moovit users will be able to rent a car when they need one in accordance with the “pick up anywhere, drop off anywhere” slogan. A map will show all the DriveNow vehicles in the area, which consumers can rent for as long as they wish, with billing by the minute.
Also included within the app are options of finding and renting bicycles, as well as tracking trains and buses.
Moovit operates in 800 cities and more than 60 countries, providing <mark>BMW</mark> with an enormous platform for expansion. At present, most automotive brands have localized mobility sharing available in a small number of cities. This partnership could help <mark>BMW</mark> get out in front and show that automakers can be major players in the mobility service market.
<mark>BMW</mark> was an investor in Moovit’s most recent round of funding. The new relationship thus builds upon the existing sign of faith and helps position <mark>BMW</mark> as an environmentally-friendly option among other automakers.<STRONG>SBD has just released a new analytical report investigating the impacts of innovative mobility and vehicle ownership models on the automotive industry.

She sees her role as being to challenge and to spur the series on to transform the automotive and transport world to de<mark>carbon</mark>ise.</P><P>Speaking at the launch of the new title sponsorship by tech giant ABB of the Formula E electric racing series in London today, Figures challenged both Formula E boss Alejandro Agag and ABB CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer to bring about the “museum to the combustion engine” and to put a date on when it would happen.</P><P>“We have a lot to thank it (IC engine) for, it got us where we are today,” she said, but noted,”I challenge you to put a date on it (when the IC engine would be history). </P><P>“We are now in a race to the future, to de<mark>carbon</mark>ise the world. It is unstoppable, it’s just a question of when.”</P><P>Asked by this site after the event whether this meant that Formula 1 as the pinnacle of motorsport would have to become electric or become obsolete, she agreed.</P><P>The Costa Rican, who has been Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> since 2010, suggested that racing involving internal combustion engines would have a future as an entertainment, a retro series, given that there are many beautiful cars from the last 100 years that people would want to see  – and hear – race. </P><P>But as a global sporting business and as a technology leader for the automotive industry there was no question of a long term for a series which uses hybrid or any other form of fossil fuel power units.</P><P>Speaking to <A href=""https://www.popsci.com/how-will-formula-one-reckon-with-electric-cars#page-4"">Popular Science Editor Joe Brown at the end of 2017</A>, F1 managing director motorsports Ross Brawn was asked about F1 having an electric future and responded, ““I don’t see it in the next five to 10 years. I can’t see that.</P><P>“We have some tough questions to ask ourselves.”</P><P>For the short term, he added, the new owners’ view is that what F1 needs is that “The show has to be the number-one priority. The racing, the drivers, the history, the noise, the smell, the atmosphere.”</P><P>Mercedes is reputed to be building a new V6 hybrid engine for this new F1 season, with 1,000hp from just 1.6 litres. But Mercedes is also entering Formula E and F1 team boss Toto Wolff says, “The reason for us joining is that our road cars are gonna go electric — that’s a fact.”</P><P>There is an hourglass running on Formula 1’s future as a fossil fuel powered series. As governments increasingly set dates to call time on sales of petrol and diesel engined cars, the waist aperture of that hourglass opens up. </P><P>The question, as Figures says, is how long? </P><P><STRONG> What do you think of these suggestions?

However, very cold weather may cause your tires to be dangerously underinflated.</P><P>Many newer cars have a tire pressure monitor built in for each wheel that constantly measures the inflation of that tire.</P><P>A deviation from the recommended inflation pressure of your tires will cause the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) on your car to be activated.</P><P>Most TPMS measure your tires when they become significantly underinflated, and not overinflated.</P><P>Your owner's manual will indicate your recommended cold tire inflation PSI. </P><P><B>So how does the weather affect your tires?</B></P><P>Most tires are inflated with air, although some dealers are now using nitrogen because the nitrogen molecules are larger than oxygen molecules. Seepage is thus reduced through the tire walls and where the tire meets the rim. Any moisture in the tire is also eliminated, which can affect inflation.</P><P>There is a basic relationship between the change in temperature and pressure. When the temperature outside the tire changes, it will affect the pressure inside the tire.</P><P>In the fall, the colder weather will significantly lower your tire pressure. If your tire pressure has been set during the hot summer months, the first major cold wave will cause the air to contract inside your tire, lowering the pressure, thus setting off your TPMS.</P><P>The TPMS alarm is more prone to go off if one of your tires is already slightly underinflated. In addition, cars that sit outside all night will be affected more by the colder weather than those kept in a garage. </P><P>To alleviate that annoying tire light, check your tire pressure monthly, during the morning, when tires are cold. During this time, make sure all tires are at the PSI indicated in your manual.</P><P>As you drive your car, friction causes the tires to heat up, increasing the pressure within the tire. Checking the tire pressure after you have been driving around may give inaccurate, misleadingly high pressure readings.</P><P>Most tires can handle higher pressures resulting from driving and in hot weather, provided they were set at the &quot;correct&quot; pressure when cold.</P><P>If your TPMS light comes on, immediately check your tire inflation, or have a dealer check it for you. </P><P>Running on underinflated tires will negatively affect gas mileage and will substantially increase tire wear, as well as resulting in poor, dangerous handling.</P><P>Increased friction created while driving on underinflated tires will cause tires to overheat and increase the risk of a blowout.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The average improvement for all cars sold in the EU was just 1.7%. This is more than last year’s all-time low of 0.7 per cent, but still not enough to meet <mark>climate</mark> targets.</P><P>Jos Dings, director of T&amp;E said: “With the threat of legislation looming, <mark>BMW</mark> has shown that even premium carmakers can seriously reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB>.  But the slow response of most carmakers shows that the EU needs to keep up the pressure with challenging, long-term CO<SUB>2</SUB> targets.”</P><P>In December 2007 the European Commission proposed that new cars should emit, on average, no more than 130g CO<SUB>2</SUB>/km by 2012.  But according to the planned law, each company would receive its own target, based on the average weight of its vehicles in that year; premium carmakers would therefore get easier targets.  </P><P>Despite this, German carmakers, including <mark>BMW</mark>, have been lobbying hard against the targets, arguing that they should be ‘phased-in’ over several years.  In effect this would mean that the target would initially only apply to the cleanest segment of the fleet.  </P><P>Dings said: “German carmakers want CO<SUB>2</SUB> targets to only apply to the cleanest cars in the early years.  It’s the equivalent of demanding that a smoking ban should only apply to non-smokers.”</P><P>The T&amp;E report shows that German carmakers now appear to be closing the gap on their French and Italian rivals, in contrast to last year when their emissions actually increased on average.</P><P>Other companies that made notable improvements in CO<SUB>2</SUB> reductions include Hyundai Motor (-3.9%) and Daimler AG (-3.5%).  But more than half of Daimler’s improvement is a result of the sale last year of its gas-guzzling Chrysler arm, not to enhanced fuel efficiency of Daimler’s cars.  </P><P>Industry lobbyists are also arguing for ‘flexfuel’ cars (that can run on both biofuels and conventional fuel) to be considered as low CO<SUB>2</SUB> models, regardless of their actual emissions.  That would be a mistake according to T&amp;E.  The environmental impact (including CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions) of biofuels are currently very uncertain, and there is no guarantee that drivers will actually use them.  Replacing the fuel is also no substitute for energy efficiency measures. Given the crucial role of vehicle efficiency in achieving <mark>climate</mark> and oil dependence objectives, such an ‘escape’ would be unacceptable. </P><P>The European Parliament’s Environment Committee is scheduled to vote on the car CO<SUB>2</SUB> law on 8-9 September. </P><P>T&amp;E is calling for a target of 120g/km by 2012, in line with an official EU target first proposed in 1994 by the former German environment minister Angela Merkel (now Chancellor).  The fourteen-year-old target was supposed to be achieved by 2005 and has already been postponed three times.</P><P>The 120g/km average target can be met with existing technology including stop-start engines, weight reduction, engine downsizing and other modest improvements.  T&amp;E is therefore also calling for a long-term target of 80 g/km by 2020 to ensure that carmakers invest now in the technology needed to dramatically improve fuel efficiency in the long term.</P><P>The T&amp;E report, based on sales in Europe in 2007, are derived from official EU monitoring data obtained by T&amp;E under laws granting access to official documents.  T&amp;E commissioned the independent Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP) in London to analyse the data.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It contributes about one-fifth of the EU's total emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>).</P><P>Road transport is one of the few sectors where emissions have been rising rapidly over the last 20 years, with the exception of the period 2008 to 2010 when lower transport activity due to the economic slowdown brought a drop in CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions. In the period 1990 to 2010 emissions from road transport increased by 22.6%. This increase acted as a brake on the EU's progress in cutting overall emissions of greenhouse gases, which fell by 15.4%.</P><P>Passenger cars alone are responsible for around 12% of EU CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions. Although there have been significant improvements over recent years in vehicle technology – particularly in fuel efficiency, which translates into lower CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions – these have not been enough to neutralise the effect of increases in traffic and vehicle size.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">What is the EU's objective?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The <A href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32009R0443"">EU Regulation on passenger cars</A> is the first main measure of the <A href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/vehicles_en"">EU Strategy to reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from light-duty vehicles</A>(cars and vans). Under the Regulation, average CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from cars should not exceed 130 grams CO<SUB>2</SUB> per km by 2015 and should drop further to 95g/km by 2020. The 130 grams target will be phased in between 2012 and 2015. It represents a reduction of 19% compared with the 2006 level (161.3 g CO<SUB>2</SUB> per km).</P><P>This approach is similar to the <A href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32011R0510"">legislation on CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from light commercial vehicles</A> (vans) adopted in 2011. Achieving these targets will help Member States reach the economy-wide reductions in greenhouse gases they have committed to deliver by 2020 under the <A href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2020_en""><mark>climate</mark> and energy package</A>.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How will it work in practice?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Each manufacturer gets an individual annual target based on the average mass of all its new cars registered in the EU in a given year. As of 2012, manufacturers must ensure that 65% of the new cars registered in the EU each year have average emissions that are below their respective targets. The percentage rises to 75% in 2013, 80% in 2014 and 100% in 2015.</P><P>Indicative emissions are established for each car according to its mass on the basis of the emissions limit value curve in Annex I in the Regulation. The limit value curve is set in such a way that a fleet average of 130 grams of CO<SUB>2</SUB> per km is achieved for the EU as a whole.</P><P>Only the fleet average is regulated, so manufacturers will still be able to make vehicles with emissions above their indicative targets if these are offset by other vehicles which are below their indicative targets.</P><P>In order to comply with the regulation, a manufacturer will have to ensure that the overall sales-weighted average of all its new cars does not exceed the limit value curve. The curve for passenger cars is also set in such a way that, compared to today, emissions from heavier cars will have to be reduced by more than those from lighter cars.</P><P>The precise formula for the limit value curve is:</P><P>Permitted specific emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB> = 130 + a × (M – M0)</P><P>Where:</P><UL><LI>a = 0.0457</LI></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">What if a manufacturer does not meet its target?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>If a manufacturer's average emission levels are above the target set by the limit value curve it will have to pay an excess emissions premium. The more a manufacturer goes above the target, the higher the premium. It will be calculated on the basis of the number of grams per kilometre (g/km) that an average vehicle registered by the manufacturer is above the target, multiplied by the number of cars registered by the manufacturer. A premium of €5 per car registered will apply to the first g/km above the target, €15 for the second g/km, €25 for the third g/km, and €95 for each further g/km. From 2019 every g/km of exceedence will cost €95.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How does this legislation differ from legislation on light commercial vehicles (vans)?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The vans legislation is closely modelled on the legislation for cars. However, as the car market differs from the van market, there are some differences between the two regulations.</P><P>The limit value curve is different in its value and its slope because cars are lighter and emit less CO<SUB>2</SUB> than vans. Therefore, the limit value curve is flatter for cars, meaning that more reductions are required from larger cars. This is not the case for vans, because there is little risk of an uncontrolled increase in the size of vans.</P><P>The phase-in period for vans also starts later than for cars because the light commercial vehicles regulation was adopted later. The rules on derogations for small-volume manufacturers are also different.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How are the manufacturers placed in relation to their targets?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The chart below shows the actual position of the various car manufacturers in terms of the average CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions of the new cars they manufactured in 2006 (the year on which the Regulation's impact assessment was based).</P><P>The up-to-date information on average CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions of different manufacturers is available at the <A href=""http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/<mark>co2</mark>-cars-emission-2"">European Environment Agency's website</A>.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How will manufacturers' progress be monitored?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The relevant national authorities in each Member State will report annual registration figures for new cars to the European Commission, which will collate the data. Manufacturers will be invited to check that the data is correct. On that basis the Commission will publish, by 31 October each year, a list showing the performance of each manufacturer in terms of its average emissions and compliance with the annual emissions target. This will allow manufacturers' progress to be tracked. The data can be found at the <A href=""http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/<mark>co2</mark>-cars-emission-2"">European Environment Agency's website</A>.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How will the regulation promote alternative technologies?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><H4>Super-credits</H4><P>Manufacturers which produce cars with extremely low emissions (below 50g/km) will be given extra incentives in the first few years. When calculating the average emissions of each manufacturer's fleet, each low-emitting car will be counted as 3.5 vehicles in 2012 and 2013, reducing to 2.5 in 2014, 1.5 vehicles in 2015 and one vehicle from 2016. This will lower the manufacturer's average emissions as calculated by the Commission, making it easier to meet the target.</P><H4>Eco-<mark>innovation</mark>s</H4><P>Because the test procedure used for EU vehicle type approval is outdated, certain innovative technologies cannot demonstrate their CO<SUB>2</SUB>-reducing effects under the type approval test. As an interim procedure until the test procedure is revised, manufacturers which fit new cars with approved &quot;eco-<mark>innovation</mark>s&quot; that reduce emissions will be able to count up to 7 g/km worth of emission savings towards the 130 g/km target. The savings must be independently verified. See also: <A href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/vehicles/cars_en#tab-0-1"">eco-<mark>innovation</mark>s</A>.</P><H4>Alternative fuel vehicles</H4><P>Vehicles capable of running on E85 fuel (a mixture of petrol with 85% ethanol) will be considered, until the end of 2015, as having CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions 5% lower than the level  reported by the Member States provided that 30% of the filling stations in the Member State where the vehicle is registered offer this type of fuel. The fuel must comply with the sustainability criteria set by other legislation.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How will manufacturers comply? What about small manufacturers?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Manufacturers may form a pool to meet the specific emissions targets jointly. When forming a pool, manufacturers must respect the rules of competition law: the information they exchange should be limited to average specific emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, their specific emissions targets, and their total number of vehicles registered.</P><P>In addition, manufacturers which sell fewer than 10,000 cars per year and which cannot or do not wish to join a pool can instead apply to the Commission for an individual target. Manufacturers selling between 10,000 and 300,000 cars per year can apply for a fixed target of a 25% reduction from their 2007 average emissions.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">What about the impact on car buyers?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Cars are expected to become more fuel-efficient as a result of new investments and technologies. This will lead to fuel cost savings for users.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Will cars become more expensive?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>It is not certain that the cost of meeting the new targets for cars will be passed on by manufacturers to buyers. However, even if the purchase price of vehicles rises slightly, this will be more than compensated for by fuel savings over the vehicle's lifetime.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Will older vehicles have to be taken off the market?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>No, the emissions targets apply only to new cars. Cars registered before 2012 will not be affected. The lower fuel consumption of new cars may however provide a powerful incentive for replacing older cars by newer ones.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Is this part of a wider strategy?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Yes. The Commission has a comprehensive strategy, adopted in 2007, which sets the objective of limiting average CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from new vehicles to 120 g/km. This is to be achieved through setting emissions performance standards for cars and vans and through additional measures that can bring a further reduction of 10 grams CO<SUB>2</SUB> per km.</P><P>Furthermore, to promote the purchase of fuel-efficient cars, an EU-wide system of consumer information on the CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions of all new cars is in operation.</P><P>Member States are also encouraged to promote fuel-efficient cars through their vehicle taxation policies.</P><P>Besides the regulation limiting CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from new passenger cars, which was adopted in April 2009, the measures being taken to implement the strategy are:</P><UL><LI>EU legislation to reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from new light commercial vehicles (adopted in May 2011)</LI><LI>Improvements to car components with the highest impact on fuel consumption, such as:</LI><LI>standards on rolling resistance of tyres,</LI><LI>standards on the efficiency of mobile air conditioning,</LI><LI>on-board indicators incentivising more efficient driving,</LI><LI>gradual reduction in the <mark>carbon</mark> content of road fuels, notably through increased use of sustainably produced biofuels.</LI></UL><P>For more details on the implementation of the Strategy, see the <A href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52010DC0656"">progress report</A> adopted in November 2010.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">What is the next step?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The Regulation on cars is directly applicable in the Member States and does not need to be transposed into national law through national legal instruments.</P><P>The Regulation is currently being reviewed with a view to implementing the 2020 target of 95 g/km.</P></DIV></DIV><H2>Questions and answers on the proposed Regulation defining the modalities for reaching the 2020 target for CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from new cars (July 2012)</H2><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How much will the 2020 mandatory target save consumers in lower fuel bills?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The 2020 target for cars of 95 g CO<SUB>2</SUB>/km implies reductions in annual fuel consumption to private users and business owners of 27% compared with the 2015 mandatory target of 130g. For an average car, it is estimated the consumer will save some €340 in the first year, and a total of €2904-3836 (depending on the price of fuel) over the car's lifetime (13 years), as compared with the 2015 target. The higher the oil price, the greater the overall savings will be.</P><P>For both cars and vans, the 'payback period' – the time it takes for cumulative fuel cost savings to outweigh the additional cost of buying a more fuel-efficient vehicle - is below five years. Net cost savings over a vehicle's lifetime are estimated at around €2000 for cars and €2500 for vans.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Will the 2020 target increase the price of cars?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>It may do, but this depends on how far producers pass on additional manufacturing costs through higher vehicle prices. The average additional manufacturing cost is estimated at around €1100 per car in 2020. Even if the full additional cost is passed on through higher prices, the Commission's impact assessment shows that this extra cost to purchasers will be outweighed several times over by fuel cost savings over the lifetime of the vehicle. Over the past decade new car prices have decreased on average by about 1% annually while fuel consumption and CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions have also fallen every year. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) has stated that <A href=""http://www.acea.be/collection/<mark>co2</mark>_emissions_faq_on_<mark>co2</mark>/"">this trend is not likely to change</A>.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Will the tighter emission targets be bad for the economy?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>No, on the contrary. The proposals are expected to stimulate research and <mark>innovation</mark> in the automotive sector, promoting green growth and jobs and improving the international competitiveness of the EU industry. The impact assessment shows that the regulations would shift spending from fuel, which has a low impact on employment, to vehicle technology and other goods.</P><P>Compared with the 2015/2017 targets for cars and vans, it is estimated that consumers will save €27bn per year in fuel costs in 2025, rising to €36bn in 2030. The 2020 targets could increase EU GDP by €12bn annually and spending on employment by some €9bn a year.</P><P>The proposals would in total save almost 160 million tonnes of oil, worth about €70bn at today's prices, in the period to 2030. They would also prevent the emission of around 420 million tonnes of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, over the same period, resulting in net cost savings to society of €100-200 for every tonne of CO<SUB>2</SUB> avoided.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Will older vehicles have to be taken off the road?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>No, the emission limits will apply only to new vehicles. Those sold before 2020 will not be affected and will not have to be taken off the road. But the lower fuel costs of the new vehicles will provide a powerful incentive for replacing old cars and vans.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How does the 2020 target compare with current emission levels?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The 2020 mandatory target for cars of 95g CO<SUB>2</SUB>/km is 27% lower than the 2015 target of 130 g/km and 30% below last year's average level of 135.7g/km.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How have the 2020 targets been set?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The 2020 targets were established during the political process involving the European Parliament and Council that led to the adoption of the existing Regulations. The Commission has verified that the 2020 targets are achievable at reasonable cost by carrying out a thorough analysis of the available technologies and of their costs and benefits.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Are the 2020 targets technically and economically feasible?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Yes, the Commission's assessment of the technologies currently available shows that these are available to allow manufacturers to reach the targets at reasonable cost. The technological potential remains for further reductions beyond 2020, particularly in the case of vans.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Has the Commission consulted stakeholders on its proposal?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Yes, an on-line public consultation on policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from road vehicles was held from September to December 2011. The <A href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/consultations/articles/0012_en"">results are available here</A>.</P><P>In addition, a stakeholder meeting was held in December 2011 where the results of the car and van analysis were presented (see <A href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/events/articles/0048_en"">here for summary of the meeting</A>), and the CARS21 High Level Group also discussed the targets.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Are the 2020 proposals in line with the recommendations of CARS21?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Yes, the key recommendations of the CARS21 High Level Group regarding the 2020 CO<SUB>2</SUB> targets were that they should be implemented without change. The Commission's proposals do that.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Are the proposals part of a wider strategy?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Yes. The Commission has a comprehensive strategy, adopted in 2007, to reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from new cars and vans. A wide range of measures has been implemented. For details see the <A href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/vehicles_en#tab-0-1"">Commission's progress report</A>. Following adoption of the latest <A href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52011DC0144"">Transport White Paper</A>, the Commission is now pursuing a comprehensive strategy to reduce GHG emissions from transport by 60% compared to 1990 levels by 2050. CO<SUB>2</SUB> standards for vehicles form a key part of this overall strategy.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Have the 2020 targets for cars and vans been set in the same way?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Yes, the underlying assessment is identical. It looks at the technologies available and their costs. The most appropriate way of distributing the effort is then assessed. While the assessment methodology is the same, the results are slightly different because of the different characteristics of the markets for cars and vans.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How will small manufacturers comply?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>As in the existing regulations, manufacturers may form a pool to meet the mandatory emission targets jointly. When forming a pool, manufacturers must respect the rules of competition law; the information they exchange should be limited to average specific emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, their specific emissions targets, and their total number of vehicles registered.</P><P>In addition, smaller manufacturers benefit from provisions enabling them to have less demanding targets. The very smallest manufacturers registering less than 500 vehicles per year would be exempt from meeting the targets.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Why produce the proposals now?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The existing regulations state that the Commission should bring forward proposals for implementing the 2020 targets by the end of this year. The Commission is doing so several months before the deadline so that the modalities can be agreed as early as possible in order to increase certainty for manufacturers.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Why make two separate proposals? Why not merge the Regulations?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>There are two existing regulations with slightly different requirements so it makes sense to have a separate amending measure for each one. The option of merging the regulations was assessed in the impact assessment, but because of the differences between the characteristics of the car and van markets and van testing procedures it was not possible to merge the requirements into one structure.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Will the proposals promote electric, hybrid and other alternative propulsion systems?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Yes, the proposed Regulations not only create an incentive to improve internal combustion engines using petrol and diesel but will also spur electric, plug-in hybrid, fuel cell, natural gas, and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas)-fuelled vehicles. Manufacturers will be free to reduce emissions in the most cost-effective manner. This is in line with the Commission's standard approach of being technology-neutral.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Isn't CO<SUB>2</SUB> being over-emphasised compared with other pollutants?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Other pollutants in vehicle emissions are regulated through EU legislation governing air quality and these are also being progressively reduced. The latest emission standards for these pollutants, known as Euro 6, come into force from 2014. Many technologies can reduce emissions of both CO<SUB>2</SUB> and the traditional pollutants which affect air quality.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">The European Parliament has asked for 2025 CO<SUB>2</SUB> targets for cars and vans. When will these be proposed?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The Commission has said it intends to issue a communication around the end of 2012 in order to carry out a consultation on the form and stringency of post-2020 CO<SUB>2</SUB> targets for light duty vehicles. It would be premature to propose the targets before that consultation has taken place.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Isn't the Commission's approach flawed since real world emissions are not the same as test cycle results?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>While it is clear that the emissions test cycle gives very different results from real world driving, there is no evidence that test cycle results do not correlate to real world emissions. A vehicle with lower emissions in the test cycle will also have lower emissions under real conditions.</P><P>The Commission is nevertheless taking part in international efforts to develop a new global test procedure for light duty vehicles and it is hoped that this will result in CO<SUB>2</SUB> values that are somewhat more realistic than the current test procedures.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Why has the Commission based its proposal on a vehicle's mass rather than other possible parameters?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The existing cars Regulation is based on a vehicle's mass and in drawing up its proposal for the 2020 target the Commission assessed a wide range of other possible bases for the future Regulation. All of these parameters except using the area of the vehicle (known as its 'footprint') were found to be undesirable. The possible use of footprint instead of mass was analysed in detail. It does offer some benefits, including slightly lower costs. However, it was considered that providing certainty for manufacturers ruled out a change of the basis for the regulation for 2020.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Will the proposals put certain car manufacturers at a disadvantage?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The impact assessment addressed the questions of competitive neutrality and social equity. These were assessed based on the relative retail price increase for different manufacturers and car segments. The Commission believes that its proposal is fair to all cars manufacturers taking into account the full range of factors to be considered.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Why include super credits?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The impact assessment says they increase emissions.</P><P>It is true that the impact assessment shows super credits can lead to increased CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions if significant use is made of them. However, super credits can also be seen as providing a strong incentive for manufacturers to develop and market technologies that will need to be deployed more extensively in the future. They can therefore be considered as a sort of technological stimulus.</P><P>For this reason it is appropriate to allow for super-credits for a period of four years while limiting the number of vehicles which can benefit from them to 20 000 cars per manufacturer over the duration of the scheme.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Why does the Commission not propose phasing in the 2020 limit over a number of years?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Phasing in the new limit prior to 2020 would be more demanding on manufacturers and could make it more difficult for them to comply. On the other hand, phasing in the target starting 2020 onwards would weaken the Regulation and achieve lower CO<SUB>2</SUB> savings than the Council and European Parliament foresaw when requesting the 95g CO<SUB>2</SUB>/km target. This would not be helpful in view of the EU's target of reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to 1990 by 2020. It would also be contrary to the recommendation of the CARS21 High Level Group that the 95g/km target should be implemented in 2020.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Will the limit value curve for 2020 have a different slope compared to the 2015 target?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The limit value curve serves to calculate the specific emission targets for an individual car manufacturer's fleet average. The curve describes the relationship between the CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions target and the mass of the vehicle (expressed in kgs). The curve implies that heavier cars are allowed higher emissions than lighter cars, while ensuring that the overall fleet average target of 95 g in 2020 is met.</P><P>For 2020 the slope of the curve would remain at 60%, based on 2006 fleet data, the same as in the legislation for 2015. The line proposed by the Commission would require the same level of reduction effort (27%) from all vehicle types as compared to the 2015 limits. This 27% reduction represents the difference between the 2015 target of 130g and the 2020 target of 95g. As a result, the relative effort for each manufacturer is not altered.</P></DIV></DIV></DD></DL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""sidebar-right"" class=""col-lg-3 col-md-12 col-sm-0 col-xs-0 sidebar-right  hidden-print""><DIV class=""region region-sidebar-right""><DIV id=""block-views-clima-read-more-block"" class=""block block-views panel panel-default clearfix""><DIV class=""panel-heading"">

We are excited to be expanding this involvement as <mark>BMW</mark> Motorsport’s partner, in addition to being the <mark>BMW</mark> Group’s recommended supplier of aftermarket engine oils.</P><P>The partnership with <mark>BMW</mark> highlights the significant contribution that our brands such as Shell Helix Ultra and Pennzoil Platinum motor oils and Shell V-Power fuels can make to the performance of <mark>BMW</mark> cars both on and off the track. This collaboration will enable two like-minded companies to push the boundaries of both motor oil, fuel and engine development - hopefully for the ultimate benefit of the everyday car driver.”</P><P>Motor oils are crucial in ensuring engine durability and enabling vehicle efficiency and performance. Their cleansing, friction reduction and temperature control properties are important contributors to durability and performance. Evolving motorsport race rules have made the use of premium oils even more vital for an ambitious race team such as <mark>BMW</mark>. For example each DTM manufacturer is only permitted nine engines to last the full 2015 season. In pre-season testing, <mark>BMW</mark> Motorsport has already seen enhanced performance benefits to the engine from using Shell Helix Ultra with PurePlus Technology.</P><P>“Everyone at <mark>BMW</mark> Motorsport is delighted that we can count on the support of Shell in the future, both in DTM and USCC, as well as the Nürburgring 24 Hours,” said <mark>BMW</mark> Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “Shell Helix Ultra and Pennzoil Platinum as products are perfectly suited to our motorsport projects. We are putting our faith in these high-performance motor oils, and hope that the new partnership will allow us to lay the foundation for great success together on the racetrack.”</P><P>Shell will allocate a dedicated team of engineers, who will work alongside <mark>BMW</mark> Motorsport engineers. They will apply decades of motorsport experience to develop a bespoke blend of motor oil for the <mark>BMW</mark> M4 DTM car. This development will be on-going during testing and the race season.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV><DIV class=""textimage basecomponent-sightly parbase section""><SECTION class=""component text-image text-image--image-left text-image--image-quarter colour--palette-0 cq-dd-image"" data-ast-component=""text-image"" data-ast-separator=""false""><DIV class=""component__base text-image__base""><DIV class=""component__body text-image__body""><ARTICLE class=""text-image__content""><DIV class=""text-image__text""><H3>Enquiries:</H3><P>Shell Global Media Relations: +44 207 934 5550</P><P>Shell Motorsport: Nick Garton, <A href=""mailto:nick@crunchcommunications.co.uk"" data-resource-path=""/content/royaldutchshell/corporate/global/en_gb/business-customers/lubricants-for-business/news-and-media-releases/2015/shell-and-<mark>bmw</mark>-deepen-collaboration/jcr:content/par/textimage_1783690141"" class="" text-link link-info"">Nick@crunchcommunications.co.uk</A>, </P><P>+44 (0) 207 384 6199</P><P>Shell Lubricants Global: Mary B.

The act set the objective of “assist[ing] the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change systems.” With federal support ranging from $2.2 billion in 1990 (in 2008 dollars) to $1.8 billion in 2008, the USGCRP<A href=""/read/12782/chapter/8#p2001c3c58960163001""><SUP>1</SUP></A> has made enormous contributions to the understanding of <mark>climate change</mark> over the past two decades, including a considerable fraction of the advances summarized in <A href=""/read/12782/chapter/5#p2001c3c59970027001"">Chapter 2</A> (see, e.g., USGCRP, 2009b).</P><P class=""bodytextfp"">There have been a wide range of assessments, observations, and reviews of the USGCRP, including mandated formal reviews by the NRC (1999a, 2003a, 2004b, 2005e, 2007f, 2009k) and assessments and observations by other groups (e.g., the Congressional Research Service). Most of these reviews have praised the USGCRP for its support and facilitation of major advances in our understanding of the natural science aspects of global change, including the physical <mark>climate</mark> system, atmospheric chemistry, hydrology, and ecosystems, and also for supporting national and international scientific assessments. Earlier reviews of the program also noted significant progress in establishing a comprehensive and inclusive national <mark>climate change</mark> assessment process and in providing strategic guidance that promoted major advances in observations and modeling, although later reviews have noted a decline in the support for and effectiveness of these activities.</P><P class=""bodytextfp"">One persistent area of criticism has been the scope and balance of the program. In its early years, the primary research emphasis of USGCRP was on the physical <mark>climate</mark> system. The program has consistently aspired to call increasing attention to human interactions with the Earth’s <mark>climate</mark> and other environmental systems, but these aspirations have for the most part fallen short (NRC, 2007f). Another persistent criticism has focused on decision support, including progress in decision-support science and whether the program has lived up to its mandate of providing useful information for decision making (NRC, 2007f, 2009k).

Moreover, the failure to follow through with periodic, comprehensive national <mark>climate change</mark> assessments weakened the program’s ability to build a consistent and <mark>sustainable</mark> relationship with stakeholders. Other troubling signs include a decline in congressional oversight of and interest in the program—measured, for example, by the number of hearings convened to review aspects of the program—and an overall decline of 18 percent (in constant 2008 dollars) in program funding from 1990 to the present (NRC, 2007f, 2009k).</P><P class=""bodytextfp"">Past NRC reviews have also pointed out weaknesses in the program’s structure and institutional processes. For example, the program has relied on individual federal agencies to identify and engage in areas of <mark>climate change</mark> research aligned with their missions, with only a few, typically episodic and informal, mechanisms for supporting research in areas that do not map onto agency missions. One result of this “stove-piping” has been uneven progress, with some research elements receiving significant funding and making excellent progress, while other research areas—including those associated with several of the crosscutting themes identified in <A href=""/read/12782/chapter/7#p2001c3c59970091001"">Chapter 4</A>—receiving much less attention. Moreover, without strong coordination, leadership, and buy-in from the full range of federal agencies affected by <mark>climate change</mark>, the program has been limited in its ability to support the evolving needs for <mark>climate</mark> science, including research that could support more effective responses to <mark>climate change</mark>. Additionally, as discussed in the next section of the chapter, the activities of the USGCRP have not been very well coordinated with the <mark>Climate Change</mark> Technology Program (NRC, 2007f, 2009k) or with preliminary efforts to establish mechanisms to provide “<mark>climate</mark> services.”</P><DIV class=""bheadtitlegroup""><H5 class=""bhead""><STRONG>Needs for the <mark>Climate Change</mark> Research Program of the Future</STRONG></H5></DIV><P class=""bodytextfp"">The USGCRP currently involves 13 federal departments and agencies, and many of these organizations have several different agencies or groups active in <mark>climate change</mark> research. This scope of engagement is essential given the broad range of public interests that will be affected by <mark>climate change</mark>. However, this broad scope and inconsistencies between the mandates of the Global Change Research Act and the narrower missions of the participating agencies create a difficult and complex management environment. For example, as noted in the previous subsection, gaps between agency missions have led to weaknesses and gaps in certain research areas. Furthermore, progress on several key crosscutting issues, such as maintaining and improving <mark>climate</mark>-related observational programs, have suffered from a lack of leadership and coordination (e.g., NRC, 2008d).

The Panel on Advancing the Science of <mark>Climate Change</mark> considered several alternatives, each with its strengths and weaknesses. One model is to create a new office or agency that aggregates all federal <mark>climate change</mark> research into one organizational structure. This harkens to the call in the 1990s for a National Institute of the Environment to be the home for all federal environmental research. An NRC report examined this proposal and saw several problems with as well as several advantages to this approach (NRC, 1993). For example, a consolidated aproach would improve cross-agency coordination and planning, while a more distributed responsibility for environmental research leads to improved linkages between researchers and decision makers. The report called for “cultural changes” in the practice of environmental research in the federal government, including greater engagement of the ecological, social, and engineering sciences. It also considered several options for organizing these changes and suggested that the best immediate step would be to retain the multiagency support of environmental research but with better coordination and attention to neglected priorities, rather than consolidate research into a single agency.</P><P class=""bodytextfp"">For <mark>climate change</mark> research, a consolidated agency would facilitate coordination and allow for priority setting based on a systematic analysis, such as the seven research themes identified in <A href=""/read/12782/chapter/7#p2001c3c59970091001"">Chapter 4</A>. Neglected high-priority areas could thus be allocated the resources needed to move them forward. Decision makers and the public would also have a single entity to consult on <mark>climate change</mark>. However, there are many disadvantages to consolidation, and those may outweigh its benefits. First, given the many challenges facing the federal government at present, it is unlikely that a proposal to create a new agency that would pull current research functions out of existing agencies could reach an actionable level on the federal agenda. Second, one of the strengths of the USGCRP is that it encourages engagement by multiple agencies and, thus, has been able to adapt relatively easily as concerns about and needs for scientific understanding of <mark>climate change</mark> have spread to affect the missions of more and more agencies. This trend is likely to continue, especially as more agencies are involved in efforts to respond to <mark>climate change</mark>. Openness to new partnerships, which is a strength of the current USGCRP, would likely be reduced with the creation of a new agency. In addition, a single agency would be limited in its ability to draw on the strengths of the non-USGCRP components of currently participating agencies. For example, NASA’s Earth science activities benefit significantly from their integration with other complementary aspects of NASA’s portfolio. These benefits could be significantly compromised if the Earth science activity were moved from NASA to another entity.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""page"" data-page=""166"" data-display=""166"" data-format=""html""><DIV class=""page-tools""><DIV class=""page-tools-inner""><SPAN class=""page-number"">Page 166 </SPAN><SPAN class=""page-actions""><SPAN class=""page-actions-inner""><A href=""#"" class=""page-action share addthis_button"" title=""Share this page"" addthis:url=""http://www.nap.edu/read/12782/page/166"" id=""atic""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Share</SPAN></A><A href=""#"" class=""page-action cite"" title=""Cite this page""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Cite</SPAN></A></SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""page-tools-panel""><DIV class=""panel-citation""><STRONG>Suggested Citation:</STRONG>&quot;5 Recommendations for Meeting the Challenge of <mark>Climate Change</mark> Research.&quot; National Research Council.  2010. <EM>Advancing the Science of <mark>Climate Change</mark></EM>.

The major advantage of the continuance of the USGCRP in this coordinating role is that the program already exists and has the legal authority and mandate to engage in a cross-agency research program. In fact, a careful reading of the Global Change Research Act of 1990 indicates that the program was intended to accomplish many of the goals identified in this report. The main disadvantages of a continuation of the USGCRP are the weaknesses highlighted in the previous subsection. Hence, provided that these weaknesses can be addressed, the panel finds that a modified USGCRP could serve the role of leading and coordinating an integrated, decision-relevant, and expanded <mark>climate change</mark> research enterprise that continues to pursue an enhanced understanding of the causes and consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> while also improving understanding of and support for responses to <mark>climate change</mark>. Indeed, as of the writing of this report, the USGCRP is already engaging in a strategic planning process to address the weaknesses and pursue the opportunities identified in past reviews of the program. The next two subsections describe ways in which the current program might be reshaped to better meet the challenges of the new era of <mark>climate change</mark> research while maintaining its existing strengths.</P><DIV class=""bheadtitlegroup""><H5 class=""bhead""><STRONG>Improving the Relevance of the USGCRP to Decision Making</STRONG></H5></DIV><P class=""bodytextfp"">A common finding among many past reports (for example, NRC, 2007a, 2008b, 2009g), and this one, is that improving the relevance and utility of scientific research and infusing scientific information into the decision-making process require increased dialogue and engagement between scientists and decision makers. Several mechanisms help connect scientific and decision-making entities in the context of the USGCRP. For example, the USGCRP could establish an <EM>external advisory board</EM> to provide input on research needs, to review and provide advice on research priorities, and to guide activities designed to enhance communication and interactions with the broader stakeholder community. An external advisory board would help to ensure that priorities for research are informed by and responsive to the needs of decision makers and other information users, and it could assess and improve the program’s decision-support capabilities. If established, such a board should be composed of decision makers and stakeholders from a broad range of communities (e.g., leaders in state, local, and tribal governments; relevant businesses and industries; citizen groups; and other non-governmental organizations), including communities that are currently not strongly</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""page"" data-page=""167"" data-display=""167"" data-format=""html""><DIV class=""page-tools""><DIV class=""page-tools-inner""><SPAN class=""page-number"">Page 167 </SPAN><SPAN class=""page-actions""><SPAN class=""page-actions-inner""><A href=""#"" class=""page-action share addthis_button"" title=""Share this page"" addthis:url=""http://www.nap.edu/read/12782/page/167"" id=""atic""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Share</SPAN></A><A href=""#"" class=""page-action cite"" title=""Cite this page""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Cite</SPAN></A></SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""page-tools-panel""><DIV class=""panel-citation""><STRONG>Suggested Citation:</STRONG>&quot;5 Recommendations for Meeting the Challenge of <mark>Climate Change</mark> Research.&quot; National Research Council.  2010. <EM>Advancing the Science of <mark>Climate Change</mark></EM>.

A number of federal agencies have already taken steps to increase such engagement, but more comprehensive and coordinated efforts are needed. For example, “user councils” focusing on a particular type of decision or research area could help researchers understand the questions that are most critical for decision makers and other stakeholders, help users understand the information that science can and cannot provide, and assist in the development of enhanced decision-support processes and tools. Workshops and dialogues, such as the “listening sessions” USGCRP has held at various venues across the country, are also a valuable contribution.</P><P class=""bodytextfp"">There are two important caveats that need to be kept in mind when designing and implementing strategies to increase interactions between the research community and its stakeholders. First, and most important, interactions between users and producers of scientific information should always preserve the integrity of the research process in reaching factual conclusions. Second, input from stakeholders needs to be considered in the context of the tractability of the proposed research and the resources required, and mechanisms are needed to ensure that the scientific enterprise is not totally dominated by near-term decision-support activities.</P><DIV class=""bheadtitlegroup""><H5 class=""bhead""><STRONG>Next Steps for the USGCRP</STRONG></H5></DIV><P class=""bodytextfp"">A careful reading of the Global Change Research Act indicates that the legislation provides most of the necessary authority for implementing a strategically integrated <mark>climate change</mark> research program (see <A href=""/read/12782/chapter/27#p2001c3c59970493001"">Appendix E</A>).

For example, programs within the Departments of Agriculture or Interior that are responsible for protected lands, national parks, conservation reserves, and activities such as agricultural extension or water resources management have not been very active players in the USGCRP to date, yet they are in the process of developing responses to <mark>climate change</mark> because their missions will be directly affected by it. Such agencies and programs could play important roles in improving understanding of <mark>climate</mark> impacts and vulnerabilities and in formulating, evaluating, and improving response strategies. Data collection and research efforts performed by agencies and programs not specifically focused on <mark>climate change</mark>, such as those at the U.S. Census Bureau or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, could likewise contribute substantially to our understanding of both <mark>climate change</mark> and its interactions with other human and environmental systems. The relative ease with which the USGCRP structure can integrate new agencies or departments is a key advantage over a single consolidated entity or agency.

To address this problem, mechanisms are needed to ensure that research priorities identified by USGCRP are given greater weight by participating agencies, and the USGCRP needs the budgetary authority to implement the priorities it identifies. Improved review and oversight mechanisms, such as coordinated reviews of participating agency budgets (as opposed to merely designating established agency activities as contributions to USGCRP), would help promote accountability and would assist in evaluations of how well the priorities identified by USGCRP are reflected in the programs and budget requests of the participating agencies. Mechanisms are also needed to ensure that critical areas of research that are currently underrepresented in federal agency activities receive appropriate attention. Finally—and perhaps most difficult—program managers need to have the authority, willingness, and capability to emphasize the interdisciplinary, decision-relevant science needed to both improve understanding and support effective responses to <mark>climate change</mark>. Changes to the Global Change Research Act or other mechanisms, such as an Executive Order or performance measures, may be appropriate means to implement these changes and strengthen the program’s budget coordination and alignment with identified research priorities.</P><P class=""bodytextfp"">Changes in the USGCRP will require strong leadership. The importance of effective leadership, with adequate support and programmatic and budgetary authority to coordinate and prioritize across agencies, has been recognized in a number of previous NRC reviews of the USGCRP (NRC, 2004b, 2005e, 2007f, 2009k). Such leadership will be essential for setting priorities and building a more balanced and integrative program, ensuring effective interactions between federal research activities and action-oriented programs (as discussed in the next section of the chapter) and executing the other recommendations in this report. One step that could be taken to improve program leadership could be achieved by assigning higher-level leaders within the partner agencies and organizations to be liaisons to the program. The assignment of senior-level, experienced program managers to staff the USGCRP coordination office could increase buy-in from the participating agencies; experienced staff will be needed to address program gaps and help lead interagency program prioritization and coordination. Effective guidance and budget review could be provided by organizations such as the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the units within the Office of Management and Budget responsible for USGCRP partner agencies.</P><P class=""bodytextfp"">As noted in the first two sections of the chapter, setting research priorities needs to be an ongoing, iterative process.

Continued participation in these international activities will be crucial to an effective <mark>climate</mark> science enterprise in the United States. In particular, as noted in this report and others (e.g., NRC, 2009k), the science needs for improved <mark>climate</mark> observing systems and improved model projections of future <mark>climate change</mark> can best be met through collaborations and partnerships at the international scale. Moreover, <mark>climate change</mark> is a global challenge; impacts on ecosystems and societies span the globe and some of these impacts will cascade from one region to another. <mark>Climate change</mark> science conducted in the United States can thus play an essential role in improving the knowledge of and scientific capacity to respond to <mark>climate</mark> challenges in the developing areas of the world, where knowledge about possible responses to <mark>climate change</mark> is much more limited.</P><P class=""bodytextfp"">National and international coordination are essential, but decision-relevant research is often focused at regional and local scales.

Expanded investments will be needed in a wide range of research areas, such as energy sources that emit few or no GHGs, <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage, energy efficiency and conservation approaches (including strategies to promote adoption and use of energy-efficient technologies), and technologies to reduce emissions from agriculture and other land uses. Technologies that remove GHGs from the air or reflect more sunlight back to space (geoengineering approaches) may also warrant attention, provided that they do not replace other important research efforts (see <A href=""/read/12782/chapter/19#p2001c3c59970377001"">Chapter 15</A>).</P><P class=""bodytextfp"">A variety of research programs on transportation and energy technology development and deployment already exist in the federal government (for example and most notably, the <mark>Climate Change</mark> Technology Program led by the Department of Energy), in several states (e.g., California’s PIER program), in corporations, and through public-private partnerships such as corporate-funded university research efforts (NRC, 2009a,b,c,d). The <mark>climate change</mark> research enterprise envisioned in this report—including the USGCRP—would complement and build on these efforts. For example, research will be needed to evaluate the overall effectiveness of different technologies, possible unintended consequences of large-scale deployment, and possible tradeoffs and co-benefits with other types of responses. New scientific knowledge about human behavior, public perception, and institutional structures can help identify potential barriers to widespread implementation of promising technologies or policies to limit <mark>climate change</mark>. Research is also needed on a wide range of technology implementation and deployment issues, such as research on cost and cost effectiveness, governance issues, barriers to technology adoption, and policies and programs designed to overcome these barriers. Finally, research can help to develop frameworks for decision making that allow these barriers, costs, benefits, co-benefits, and trade-offs to be explicitly evaluated and incorporated into strategies for reducing emissions.</P><P class=""bodytextfp"">As noted in <A href=""/read/12782/chapter/7#p2001c3c59970091001"">Chapter 4</A>, an effective national research effort on limiting the magnitude of <mark>climate change</mark> will require integration of knowledge across a wide range of fields and collaboration with engineers, policy makers, and others involved in developing and implementing actions to limit <mark>climate change</mark>. However, collaboration and linkages between the USGCRP and existing programs relevant to limiting <mark>climate change</mark>—most notably the <mark>Climate Change</mark> Technology Program—are currently weak (NRC, 2009k). These linkages need to be improved, and any new programs that emerge to focus on limiting the magnitude of future <mark>climate change</mark> would surely benefit</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""page"" data-page=""175"" data-display=""175"" data-format=""html""><DIV class=""page-tools""><DIV class=""page-tools-inner""><SPAN class=""page-number"">Page 175 </SPAN><SPAN class=""page-actions""><SPAN class=""page-actions-inner""><A href=""#"" class=""page-action share addthis_button"" title=""Share this page"" addthis:url=""http://www.nap.edu/read/12782/page/175"" id=""atic""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Share</SPAN></A><A href=""#"" class=""page-action cite"" title=""Cite this page""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Cite</SPAN></A></SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""page-tools-panel""><DIV class=""panel-citation""><STRONG>Suggested Citation:</STRONG>&quot;5 Recommendations for Meeting the Challenge of <mark>Climate Change</mark> Research.&quot; National Research Council.  2010. <EM>Advancing the Science of <mark>Climate Change</mark></EM>.

In recent years large sums have been spent in an attempt to spur growth – so-called ‘quantitative easing’<EM> – </EM>with cheap loans made available to banks, and the buying of sovereign bonds, among other measures. So far, banks have been the primary recipients. This time around, the ECB has taken it a step further and started buying corporate bonds – essentially, making cheap loans to corporations, which is fundamentally a kind of subsidy to some of the biggest players in the European marketplace.</P><P>So who are the beneficiaries? Which corporations are enjoying the goodwill of the big bank?</P><P>Only a few names have surfaced over the past months, as the ECB does not reveal the names of the companies, only the codes of the bonds. Now, Corporate Europe Observatory has looked them all up, and the picture that emerges is disturbing. Notably, it seems the ECB in its own way is helping fuel <mark>climate change</mark>, providing financial support to both oil and gas companies, and car-makers, including, Shell, Repsol, Volkswagen, and <mark>BMW</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>The programme</STRONG></P><P>The Corporate Securities Purchasing Programme (CSPP) was decided in March and took off in June. Since then, the ECB has spent €46 billion on corporate bonds (as of 25 November 2016).<A class=""see-footnote"" id=""footnoteref1_abzi17c"" title=""https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omt/html/index.en.html"" href=""#footnote1_abzi17c"">1</A> According to one estimate, it is set to reach €125 billion by September 2017.<A class=""see-footnote"" id=""footnoteref2_jlq61aq"" title=""https://insights.abnamro.nl/en/2016/11/euro-corporate-watch-ecb-will-need-to-buy-more-in-primary/"" href=""#footnote2_jlq61aq"">2</A> No small sum.</P><P>Bonds are basically a form of loan. The buyer lends the issuer money, interest is paid at regular intervals, and face value is then paid back at a fixed date, the date of maturity. When bonds of a particular kind get popular on the market, corporations have to pay less interest. “It feels good to CSPP’d”, the <EM>Financial Times </EM>reported on 20 July 2016, citing research that showed how bonds actually bought by the ECB fared better than other bonds.</P><P>To issue a bond is not straightforward, it requires expertise in financial markets. Many corporations have banks of their own that manage the complicated transactions. It is a world that is not accessible to SMEs, that would go to a bank for credit, not sell bonds. For that reason, the CSPP is a helping hand to big corporations, not to SMEs.</P><P>The bonds are not bought directly by the ECB. The ECB coordinates the effort, but the actual buying takes place in a decentralized manner, with six central banks – the German, Spanish, Italian, Belgian, Finnish, and French – doing the work. They have all been assigned tasks to identify and buy attractive bonds in not just their own country, but in others as well, so the effect can be spread in a more or less even manner.</P><P>All six central banks regularly update information on their holdings on the ECB website.<A class=""see-footnote"" id=""footnoteref3_5nh0pn1"" title=""http://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omt/lending/html/index.en.html"" href=""#footnote3_5nh0pn1"">3</A> Unfortunately, except for Deutsche Bundesbank, they do not reveal the names of the companies, only the codes used to designate a particular bond, the so-called International Securities Identification Number (ISIN). But finding the names via the ISIN code is a simple job. Corporate Europe Observatory has looked them all up to see what investments the ECB has found worthy of public money.</P><P>Unfortunately, a lack of transparency at the ECB means the amounts held in bonds of individual corporations are not revealed. While many pension funds do release this information, it seems that the common national bank for hundreds of millions of European citizens is unable to! Nevertheless, a lot can be learned from the lists.</P><P><STRONG>Dirty energy and cars</STRONG></P><P>From the <A href=""https://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/corporate_bonds_cspp_list.pdf"">lists produced by Corporate Europe Observatory</A>, it seems there is a consistent strategy in terms of sectors. High priority is given to infrastructure, including motorways, trains, and even airports. However, by no means is the programme simply focused on utilities. The bond purchases as a whole tell a story; the CSPP as it stands, is about <mark>climate change</mark>. There is a distinct smell of fossil fuels in the holdings list, with some of the biggest oil companies enjoying remarkable attention from Frankfurt. The ECB has bought no less than 11 times from Shell, 16 times from Italian oil company Eni, 6 times from Repsol, 6 times from Austrian OMV, and 7 times from Total.</P><P>The clear number one sector, though, is electricity and gas utilities. When counting the purchase of bonds for example in Spain, 53 per cent are from companies involved in gas, and the corresponding number in Italy is an astounding 68 per cent.</P><P>Though the amounts – the total the ECB holds in these companies – are not available, the high number of trades indicates a strong interest in companies that are contributing the most to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The bias towards dirty energy companies is strong. Unless Siemens intends to invest in wind turbine production with the money received from the ECB, the only ‘alternative’ energy form present on the list is nuclear, with enriched uranium producer URENCO and Finnish nuclear power company Teollisuuden Voima on the list.</P><P>The ECB bond purchases also show a strong preference for the car industry. This is most clearly seen in the list of purchases by the German Bundesbank. The most frequent investment by the ECB is tied between Daimler AG (producer of Mercedes) and <mark>BMW</mark> with 15 purchases apiece. Volkswagen bonds come in at 7, whereas French carmaker Renault is at 3. Finally, it must be assumed that the presence of the Agnelli family’s investment holding company Exor is to make sure Italian cars Fiat and Ferrari also feel the Christmas spirit.</P><P><STRONG>Bizarre investments and scandals</STRONG></P><P>The inclusion of some corporations in the ECB bond-purchasing programme will raise eyebrows, particularly Volkswagen, involved in the ongoing dieselgate scandal over fraudulent reporting of emissions. Other corporations on the list currently beset by scandal include:</P><UL><LI><P>Estonian Eesti Energia, involved in the first tar sands mine in the US<A class=""see-footnote"" id=""footnoteref4_w516uw6"" title=""http://www.tarsandsresist.org/tag/estonia/"" href=""#footnote4_w516uw6"">4</A> – the dirtiest energy imaginable – and facing strong local resistance;</P></LI><LI><P>Ryanair, infamous for its contempt for labour rights;<A class=""see-footnote"" id=""footnoteref5_5ll5mad"" title=""http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ryanair-denmark-idUKKCN0PI21F20150708"" href=""#footnote5_5ll5mad"">5</A></P></LI><LI><P>Spanish company Gas Natural renown for mercilessly cutting off electricity and gas supplies, which recently led to the death in a fire of an elderly Spanish woman forced to use candles;<A class=""see-footnote"" id=""footnoteref6_d8gmixi"" title=""http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2016/11/16/catalunya/1479301923_566406.html"" href=""#footnote6_d8gmixi"">6</A></P></LI><LI><P>ENEL, an Italian energy utilities giant, involved in building of dams in South America that will seriously harm local communities – human rights abuses have been recorded in the face of local resistance;<A class=""see-footnote"" id=""footnoteref7_0yz4c84"" title=""https://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/corporate_conquistadors-en-web-0912.pdf"" href=""#footnote7_0yz4c84"">7</A></P></LI><LI><P>and Thales, producer of missiles, rifles, armoured vehicles and military drones, which has been enmeshed in many corruption scandals over the years, including one in South Africa which led to an indictment of then Deputy President, now President, Jacob Zuma.<A class=""see-footnote"" id=""footnoteref8_rltegj0"" title=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4408020.stm"" href=""#footnote8_rltegj0"">8</A></P></LI></UL><P>In addition, the three big private water corporations, Suèz, Vivendi, and Veolia have a strong showing on the French list of purchases. This might stir up angry sentiments among those who oppose the privatization of water, which has been spearheaded by these French companies.</P><P>Other investments simply appear bizarre. Why, for instance, would public entities invest in and hence subsidize a gambling company like Novomatic, owned by billionaire Johan Graf and headquartered in Austria? And why should public funds flow into the coffers of producers of luxury goods, including LVMH, producer of Moët &amp; Chandon champagne, Hennessy cognac, and classy Louis Vuitton women’s handbags, some of which carry price-tags in the thousands of euros?</P><P><STRONG>What is a good investment?</STRONG></P><P>All this begs the question: how are the official ECB investments picked? There appear to be few criteria, and none of them are qualitative in nature. The corporation must be incorporated in the Eurozone, it cannot be a financial corporation (or a credit institution supervised by the ECB), it cannot be a public entity, and the bond in question to be backed up by a positive credit rating.<A class=""see-footnote"" id=""footnoteref9_275uhfp"" title=""https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/legal/pdf/celex_32016d0016_en_txt.pdf"" href=""#footnote9_275uhfp"">9</A> Other than this, there are no official guidelines in the public domain.</P><P>The investments of the ECB are about 'quantitative easing' – making money cheap and available to shore up the Eurozone economy. Corporations can in some cases wait up to 31 years before they pay back (maximum “maturity” is up to 31 years), but in no other sense is the CSPP a long term development programme. And its effect on the real economy is yet to be seen; whether the billions of euros pumped into giant corporations actually lead to growth, jobs, or any other positive for the Eurozone economy. Imagine if this €46 billion euro had been spent on, say, insulating homes. A rough estimate shows that this eminently practical effort against <mark>climate change</mark> could have paid for the insulation of 66 million houses and led to tens of thousands of jobs.<A class=""see-footnote"" id=""footnoteref10_ugsyezb"" title=""http://www.kinggroup.ie/web/energy-services/cavity-wall-insulation/"" href=""#footnote10_ugsyezb"">10</A></P><P>Instead, what is certain is that the large sums being spent are in effect a public subsidy for corporations making <mark>climate change</mark> worse, while in no discernible way helping ordinary people recover from the economic crisis that still stalks Europe.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

						Byron Wilson | December 1, 2015					</SPAN></DIV><P>This week, 150 Heads of State and Government have convened in Paris, France, at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark>. The goal of the Conference is to “reach a new universal <mark>climate</mark> agreement that is applicable to all,” according to the <A href=""http://www.COP21.gouv.fr"" target=""_blank"">COP21.gouv.fr </A>website. The hope is that some arrangement can be reached to help reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions worldwide and keep global warming from exceeding a two degree Celsius rise in the coming years.</P><P>Emissions legislation and the transition to cleaner energy, both of which are included as strategies toward curbing <mark>climate change</mark>, have obvious impacts on the motorcycle industry. Europe, for example, has set some of the most stringent emissions standards on motorcycles with further restrictions forthcoming. Further changes are likely to be seen in the US as well, in part because of the pledges two motorcycle companies have made in accord with strategies outlined by the White House in Paris. American Honda Motor Company and the <mark>BMW</mark> Group are now involved in efforts to address global warming, both companies signing the American Business Act on <mark>Climate</mark> Pledge.</P><P>In a press release <A href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/30/white-house-announces-additional-commitments-american-business-act"" target=""_blank"">issued November 30, 2015</A>, by the White House, 154 companies are cited as having signed the pledge, each offering company-specific strategies to combat <mark>climate change</mark>. American Honda and <mark>BMW</mark> are currently the only two motorcycle OEMs to sign the pledge.</P><P>Here’s the text of the Pledge, in its entirety, courtesy of the White House:</P><P><EM>We applaud the growing number of countries that have already set ambitious targets for <mark>climate</mark> action. In this context, we support the conclusion of a <mark>climate change</mark> agreement in Paris that takes a strong step forward toward a low-<mark>carbon</mark>, <mark>sustainable</mark> future.</EM></P><P><EM>We recognize that delaying action on <mark>climate change</mark> will be costly in economic and human terms, while accelerating the transition to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy will produce multiple benefits with regard to <mark>sustainable</mark> economic growth, public health, resilience to natural disasters, and the health of the global environment.</EM></P><P>Honda has made a commitment to “reducing its total company <mark>CO2</mark> emissions by 50 percent by the year 2050, when compared to its 2000 baseline,” as well as to “reduce the <mark>CO2</mark> intensity of its automobiles, motorcycles and power equipment products worldwide by 30 percent by the year 2020, as compared to its 2000 baseline.”</P><P>“Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases remain at the center of our vision for helping to address society’s energy and environmental concerns,” said Honda North America President and CEO Takuji Yamada in a company press release. “Our efforts toward reducing GHG emissions and other environmental impacts extend to every facet of our operations.”</P><P>Part of Honda’s strategy to reach these numbers includes increasing its use of renewable energies, “establishing zero-waste-to-landfill facilities and reducing energy usage throughout its operations.”</P><P><mark>BMW</mark> is similarly motivated. Harald Krueger, Chairman of the Board of Management of <mark>BMW</mark> AG, provided this statement in a company press release:</P><P>“Sustainability plays a central role for the <mark>BMW</mark> Group. We have set up long-term sustainability goals which have defined targets to 2020 and thereafter. Therefore, we are pleased to join the American Business Act on <mark>Climate</mark> Pledge.”</P><P>“The American Business Act on <mark>Climate</mark> Pledge demonstrates our company’s public commitment to fight <mark>climate change</mark> by taking action,” added Ludwig Willisch, President and CEO, <mark>BMW</mark> of North America. “With this commitment, the <mark>BMW</mark> Group further shows its intent to continue being a leader in sustainability across the entire value chain: from R&amp;D to manufacturing to operations.”</P><P><mark>BMW</mark>’s goals include becoming the “leading automobile manufacturer in the use of renewable energy” by 2020 and continuing its investment in public/private partnerships aimed at “mass market adoption of zero-emissions vehicles.”</P><P>Strategies will be implemented at <mark>BMW</mark>’s California, South Carolina, Washington State and New Jersey locations and global initiatives will see the company reduce energy and water consumption in addition to reducing Volatile Organic Compound emissions from its vehicles.</P><P>EV technology has been slowly creeping into the mainstream motorcycle market over the past few years, highlighted by <A href=""http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2014/06/article/harley-davidson-livewire-first-ride/"" target=""_blank"">Harley-Davidson’s Livewire</A> concept and <A href=""http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2015/01/article/polaris-acquires-brammo-motorcycles/"" target=""_blank"">Polaris’ acquisition of Brammo</A> assets. Zero Motorcycles continues to lead the charge by improving the range and performance of its power sources, <mark>BMW</mark> put its C evolution electric scooter <A href=""http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2013/09/article/<mark>bmw</mark>-confirms-production-e-scooter-for-2014/"" target=""_blank"">into production in 2014</A> and Yamaha has released a <A href=""http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2015/10/article/yamaha-to-reveal-tilting-3-wheeler-electric-motorcycles-125cc-cafe-cruiser-at-tokyo-motor-show/"" target=""_blank"">number of electric concepts</A>. Pledges and promises are one thing, but actual resource allocation from major manufacturers will have a notable impact on the furthering of EV technology for motorcycles. An arms race to develop a smaller battery that provides better range, larger scale production to help reduce the final cost to consumers, investment in more charging stations and faster charging technology are all challenges to this shift to EV in the motorcycle industry. While the quiet hum of an electric motor will never replace the snarl of petrol-powered pistons and the sweet aroma of spent exhaust gasses, it will make for a very interesting and, hopefully, exciting industry in the years ahead. That’s our hope at least.</P></DIV><DIV class=""row author-box""><DIV class=""large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns""><DIV id=""author-box""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns author-avatar""><P class=""name"">Byron Wilson</P><P><B>Associate Editor</B> | <A href=""http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/author/byron-wilson/"">Articles</A> | Byron’s sure to be hunched over a laptop after the checkers are flown, caught in his own little version of heaven.

By their nature, car makers are normally conservative beasts, but progress requires trying new things, even at the risk of the occasional failure. Often, these automotive experiments are carried out by racing departments—always catnip to nerds like me who begin to salivate at the mention of words like &quot;homologation.&quot;</P><P>But recently, the cars of <mark>BMW</mark>'s i brand have captivated me the most. The plug-in hybrid i8 remains my default answer when asked about my favorite car (this happens regularly in my line of work), and it surely represents the near-term future of the sports car.</P><P>What's not to like about the i8? It looks like a proper supercar—complete with dihedral doors—but it's as practical as a Porsche 911 and a lot more fuel-efficient. The i8 has a <mark>carbon</mark>-fiber chassis, so it's very stiff but very light. The damping is brilliant even on broken road surfaces, and the way the electric motor and internal combustion engine harmonize in Sport mode will put a smile on your face come rain or shine. A convertible—the i8 Roadster—joined the line-up at this year's LA Auto Show, along with a slightly souped-up version of its urban EV, the i3S.</P><P>With these (and the self-driving iNEXT, <A href=""https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/07/<mark>bmw</mark>-intel-and-mobileye-will-launch-an-autonomous-car-in-five-years/"">due in 2021</A>), <mark>BMW</mark> is grappling with <EM>mobility</EM>, the brave new transport future that some believe will save us from the ravages of car crashes and <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><H2>A <mark>BMW</mark> will always have a steering wheel</H2><P>Autonomous and electric vehicles should be well outside of <mark>BMW</mark>'s comfort zone. After all, this is a company best known for legendary internal combustion engines and building ad campaigns on the idea of driving for fun. So the fact that <mark>BMW</mark> is getting this stuff right so far bodes well for the future. It's a future where you'll always have the option of driving your own <mark>BMW</mark>, though.</P><P>&quot;What we do not say is that all the <mark>BMW</mark>s in the future will drive fully autonomously. It's up to our customers,&quot; said Robert Irlinger, head of <mark>BMW</mark> i. &quot;But if there is a customer demand for the technique, someone will use it. For example, LA rush hour—to be honest, it's not sheer driving pleasure. Just push the button, and then maybe your car will bring you to the next place.&quot;</P><P>Irlinger sees the <mark>BMW</mark> i cars of the future giving their drivers that time back in their days—it's up to us whether we use those extra minutes to churn out a few more emails or perhaps just chill out with some music. We saw one such expression of this idea in <A href=""https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/01/<mark>bmw</mark>-uses-ces-to-show-its-autonomous-i8-concept-to-the-world/"">the i Vision Future concept</A> at CES in 2016.</P><P>When the iNEXT arrives in three years, expect it to be a service you hail, not a car you buy from your <mark>BMW</mark> dealer. Irlinger says that's for several reasons; for one thing, it's easier for a managed fleet to remain perpetually up to date with software fixes. &quot;You need something like a pilot fleet in operating cars to gain experience [with autonomous vehicles),&quot; he explained. But cost is another concern, and for these early implementations of autonomous driving technology, that may well be prohibitive even for the earliest of adopters.</P><H2>Not your typical <mark>BMW</mark> drivers</H2><P>I learned some other interesting facts in my chat with Irlinger. For one, the i3 and i8 are being bought by customers who aren't traditional <mark>BMW</mark> drivers—only one in three i3 owners is a previous customer, and 80 percent of i8s are sold to people new to <mark>BMW</mark>.</P><P>According to Irlinger, the main lessons <mark>BMW</mark> i has learned from the i3 and i8 are that its customers have range and infrastructure on the brain, which is why <mark>BMW</mark> has been working with some other OEMs on a network of 350kW chargers in Europe. Perhaps we should be surprised that there has been almost no demand from existing i3 owners looking to <A href=""https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/05/battery-bump-for-<mark>bmw</mark>-i3-existing-owners-will-be-offered-upgrade-too/"">retrofit the new, larger battery pack</A>. (<mark>BMW</mark> told me that it has only had about five serious inquiries on the matter.)</P><P>The i experiment appears to be working. Just yesterday, the company heralded the fact that it has delivered more than 100,000 electrified vehicles in 2017, and Irlinger told me he expects 2018's i3 sales to eclipse this year's. Electrification is now showing up in more of the regular <mark>BMW</mark> lineup—the 530e plug-in hybrid has been selling well since arriving earlier this year, joining a PHEV X5 and 7 Series in the showroom. Irlinger even says there <EM>will</EM> be electrified M cars in the years to come. If they end up anything like the i8, that'll be cause for cheer.</P><P><EM>Listing image by <A href=""https://www.<mark>bmw</mark>usa.com""><mark>BMW</mark></A></EM></P></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""column-wrapper""><DIV class=""left-column""><SECTION class=""article-author""><DIV class=""author-bio""><SECTION class=""author-bio-top""><A href=""/author/jonathan-m-gitlin"" class=""author-name"">Jonathan M.

Currently, the BWM Convention has been ratified by 61 countries, representing 68.46% of world merchant shipping tonnage.</P><P>From the date of entry into force, ships will be required to manage their ballast water to avoid the transfer of potentially invasive species.  All ships will be required to have a ballast water management plan and keep a ballast water record book. Ships will be required to manage their ballast water to meet the so-called D-1 standard or D-2 standard.</P><P>The D-1 standard requires ships to conduct the exchange of ballast water such that at least 95% of water by volume is exchanged far away from the coast where it would be released. </P><P>The <A href=""#Section"">D-2 standard*</A> requires ballast water management to restrict to a specified maximum the amount of viable organisms allowed to be discharged and to limit the discharge of specified indicator microbes harmful to human health.</P><P>Draft amendments to the treaty approved by the MEPC clarify when ships must comply with the requirement to meet the D-2 standard.</P><P>The draft amendments will be circulated after the entry into force of the BWM Convention on 8 September 2017, with a view to adoption at the next MEPC session (MEPC 72 in April 2018).  Under the approved amendments, new ships, i.e., ships constructed on or after 8 September 2017, shall conduct ballast water management that at least meets the D-2 standard from the date they are put into service. For existing ships, i.e., ships constructed before 8 September 2017, the date for compliance with the D-2 standard is linked with the renewal survey of the ship associated with the International Oil <mark>Pollution</mark> Prevention Certificate under MARPOL Annex I.

The 0.50% limit is prescribed in regulation 14.1.3 of MARPOL Annex VI.</P><P>The Sub-Committee on <mark>Pollution</mark> Prevention and Response (PPR) has been instructed to explore what actions may be taken to ensure consistent and effective implementation of the 0.50% m/m sulphur limit for fuel oil used by ships operating outside designated SOX Emission Control Areas and/or not making use of equivalent means such as exhaust gas cleaning systems; as well as actions that may facilitate the implementation of effective policies by IMO Member States.</P><P>To ensure this vital work is completed by 2020, the MEPC approved (subject to endorsement by the IMO Council) the holding of an intersessional working group meeting in the second half of 2018. </P><P>In other work related to air <mark>pollution</mark> matters, the MEPC:</P><UL><LI>adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex VI to designate the North Sea and the Baltic Sea as emission control areas (ECAs) for nitrogen oxides (NOX) under regulation 13 of MARPOL Annex VI.  Both ECAs will take effect on 1 January 2021, thereby considerably lowering emissions of NOx from international shipping in those areas;</LI><LI>adopted amendments to the information to be included in the bunker delivery note relating to the supply of marine fuel oil to ships which have fitted alternative mechanisms to address sulphur emission requirements;</LI><LI>adopted the 2017 Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system Guidelines.</LI></UL><P><STRONG>Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships </STRONG>The MEPC continued to build on the solid work the Organization has undertaken to address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping, with work on track for the adoption of an initial IMO strategy on the reduction of GHG emissions from ships in 2018, in accordance with a Roadmap approved at MEPC 70.</P><P>The MEPC noted agreement within a working group on a draft outline for the structure of the initial IMO Strategy.  The group met following a week-long meeting of the Intersessional Working Group on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships (26-30 June), which reported on its detailed discussions.</P><P>The initial strategy is set to include:</P><OL><LI>Preamble/introduction/context including emission scenarios</LI><LI>Levels of ambitionGuiding principles</LI><LI>List of candidate short-, mid- and long-term further measures with possible timelines and their impacts on States</LI><LI>Barriers and supportive measures; capacity building and technical cooperation; R&amp;D</LI><LI>Follow-up actions towards the development of the revised Strategy</LI><LI>Periodic review of the Strategy</LI></OL><P>The Committee approved terms of reference for the second and third meetings of the Intersessional Working Group.</P><P>In addition to further considering how to progress the matter of reduction of GHG emissions from ships and advise the Committee as appropriate, the second intersessional meeting (ISWG-GHG 2, 23-27 October 2017) has been instructed to further develop the structure and identify core elements of the draft initial IMO Strategy on reduction of GHG emissions from ships and develop draft text for inclusion in the initial Strategy, with submissions due by 22 September 2017.</P><P>The third intersessional meeting (ISWG-GHG 3, 3-6 April 2018) has been instructed, on the basis of the work of ISWG GHG 2, to finalize the draft initial IMO Strategy on reduction of GHG emissions from ships and submit a report to MEPC 72 (9-13 April 2018).</P><P><STRONG>Energy efficiency measures for ships</STRONG>Energy-efficiency design standards for new ships and associated operational energy-efficiency measures for existing ships became mandatory in 2013, with the entry into force of relevant amendments to MARPOL Annex VI. The Committee was informed that nearly 2,500 new ocean-going ships have been certified as complying with the energy efficiency standards. In other work related to the implementation of the mandatory energy efficiency measures in MARPOL Annex VI, the MEPC:</P><UL><LI>adopted 2017 Guidelines for Administration verification of ship fuel oil consumption data, to support the implementation of the mandatory MARPOL requirements for ships of 5,000 gross tonnage and above to collect consumption data for each type of fuel oil they use, as well as additional specified data, including proxies for transport work, from calendar year 2019;</LI><LI>adopted 2017 Guidelines for the development and management of the IMO Ship Fuel Oil Consumption Database;</LI><LI>approved an MEPC circular on Submission of data to the IMO data collection system for fuel oil consumption of ships from a State not Party to MARPOL Annex VI;</LI><LI>approved draft amendments to regulation 21 of MARPOL Annex VI regarding EEDI requirements for ro-ro cargo and ro-ro passenger ships, with a view to adoption at MEPC 72;</LI><LI>established a correspondence group on review of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) beyond phase 2, to report on progress by MEPC 72 and make a recommendation to MEPC 73 on the time period and reduction rates for EEDI phase 3 requirements. </LI></UL><P><STRONG>Protecting the Arctic from heavy fuel oil – work to begin at MEPC 72</STRONG>The MEPC agreed to add a new output in its work programme on the development of measures to reduce risks of use and carriage of heavy fuel oil (HFO) as fuel by ships in Arctic waters. This new output will appear on the agenda for its next session (MEPC 72) in April 2018.</P><P>Member Governments and international organizations were invited to submit concrete proposals on what type of measures should be developed, including the scope of the work, to MEPC 72, so that clear instructions can be given to the PPR Sub-Committee which will carry out the detailed technical work, starting at PPR 6.</P><P>The use and carriage of heavy fuel oil is banned in Antarctic waters under MARPOL and the IMO Polar Code recommends that States follow the same practice in the Arctic.  <STRONG>Designation of Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (Philippines) as a PSSA </STRONG>The MEPC approved the final designation of the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park, situated in the Sulu Sea, Philippines as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA), following the adoption by the Maritime Safety Committee of a new Area to be avoided as an associated protective measure. The aim is to reduce the risk of ship groundings in the park, thereby preventing any resulting marine <mark>pollution</mark> and damage to the fragile coral reef ecosystem, as well as ensuring the sustainability of local artisanal fisheries.</P><P>This brings the number of marine areas protected in this way to 15 (plus two extensions).</P><P><STRONG>OSV Chemical Code</STRONG>The MEPC approved the draft Code for the transport and handling of hazardous and noxious liquid substances in bulk on offshore support vessels (OSV Chemical Code), prepared by PPR 4 and amended and approved by MSC 98, for submission to the thirtieth IMO Assembly for adoption later this year.</P><P><STRONG>Oil <mark>pollution</mark> model courses approved</STRONG>Updated IMO Model Courses on Oil <mark>Pollution</mark> Preparedness, Response and Cooperation (OPRC Model Training Courses) were approved by the MEPC. The OPRC model training courses have been revised to provide up-to-date guidance for preparedness and response to marine oil spills.</P><P><STRONG>Major technical cooperation projects</STRONG>The MEPC was informed about recent developments with regard to major environment-related technical cooperation (TC) projects. With a view to continuing the technical cooperation efforts in marine biosafety, which started with the GloBallast Partnerships Project which came to an end in June 2017, IMO has secured further funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to prepare a full-scale document for a new global project aimed at assisting with implementation of the IMO Guidelines for controlling and managing ships’ biofouling.  </P><P>On the sidelines of the MEPC meeting,  leading shipowners and operators, classification societies, engine and technology builders and suppliers, big data providers, and oil companies signed up to a new Global Industry Alliance (GIA) to support shipping and its related industries make the transition towards a low <mark>carbon</mark> future.  The GIA has been established under the auspices of the GloMEEP Project, a GEF-United Nations Development Program (UNDP)-IMO project to support developing countries implement energy-efficiency measures for shipping.</P><P>Meanwhile, the European Union-funded Global MTCC Network (GMN) Project has successfully established maritime technology cooperation centres (MTTCs) in its five target regions - Asia, Africa, Caribbean, Latin America and Pacific. With the goal to support the move towards low-<mark>carbon</mark> shipping, the MTTCs will focus on capacity-building efforts and implementing pilot projects involving fuel oil consumption data collection and developing low-<mark>carbon</mark> technologies.</P><P>___________</P><P>* <STRONG class=""ms-rteThemeForeColor-6-0""><EM><A name=""Section"" id=""Section"" href=""/en/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/Pages/17-MEPC-71.aspx"">Regulation D-2 Ballast Water Performance Standard</A></EM></STRONG></P><OL><LI>Ships conducting Ballast Water Management in accordance with this regulation shall discharge less than 10 viable organisms per cubic metre greater than or equal to 50 micrometres in minimum dimension and less than 10 viable organisms per millilitre less than 50 micrometres in minimum dimension and greater than or equal to 10 micrometres in minimum dimension; and discharge of the indicator microbes shall not exceed the specified concentrations described in paragraph 2.</LI><LI> Indicator microbes, as a human health standard, shall include:.1 Toxicogenic Vibrio cholerae (O1 and O139) with less than 1 colony forming unit (cfu) per 100 millilitres or less than 1 cfu per 1 gram (wet weight) zooplankton samples ;.2 Escherichia coli less than 250 cfu per 100 millilitres;.3 Intestinal Enterococci less than 100 cfu per 100 milliliters.</LI></OL><DIV><A href=""#Top"">Back to top</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV> </DIV><P><STRONG>IMO</STRONG>– the International Maritime Organization – is the United Nations specialized agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine <mark>pollution</mark> by ships.</P></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

At the moment, there are large amounts of traffic on urban streets that create an increase in air <mark>pollution</mark> and loud noise. From our conversations with city officials, we’ve learned that future mobility services can only be successful if they can efficiently connect public transport and individual mobility.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">We presented our conception of future mobility during <mark>BMW</mark>’s 100 year anniversary with the <mark>BMW</mark> VISION NEXT concept cars. The car of the future is autonomous, connected, electric, <mark>sustainable</mark>, and, if desired, shareable between multiple clients. We see trends toward these developments in “Automated,”“Connected, “Electrified,” and “Shared”– ACES for short.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">In coming years, we will witness the automobile change more rapidly and substantially than ever before. Our customers should look forward to new technology and customization options. The future is exciting!</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>How is <mark>BMW</mark> helping to develop smart and liveable cities?</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">We have the opportunity to make cities more livable through technology. Our innovative vehicles and services are the primary method to achieve this.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Additionally, the <mark>BMW</mark> Group has founded a research center for urban mobility, with comprised of a variety of experts from different fields. The joint task of the team is to engage with leaders of big cities and analyze their needs. This is at the prerequisite for developing new urban mobility solutions together with cities.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>What do you see as the barriers to achieving large scale <mark>sustainable</mark> urban mobility?</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">There are currently big differences in how electro-mobility is being promoted in different countries and cities. Positive examples, like Norway, show what can be achieved with a proactive effort – one in three new cars is electric. Unfortunately, there is a lack of adequate electric vehicle charging infrastructure in many cities worldwide. This can scare away potential customers, who would otherwise want to make the switch to environmentally-friendly electro-mobility.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>What are the key <mark>innovation</mark>s and solutions that <mark>BMW</mark> are bringing to the <mark>climate change</mark> effort?</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">In our view, it is crucial to adopt a comprehensive approach to combatting <mark>climate change</mark> as business. Within the framework of our ten sustainability goals, we have targets for our products, services, production, and supply chain. In this way, we want to significantly reduce the <mark>CO2</mark> emissions of our vehicles, be a leading provider of electro-mobility, and permanently change mobility behaviour in cities.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">At the same time, we are continuing to pursue our goal of further reducing <mark>CO2</mark> emissions at our production facilities. We are increasing the energy efficiency of our facilities and are investing in renewable energy. Our vision is to ultimately have a completely emissions-free production process. To achieve this, we increased the share of renewable energy in our purchased energy mix to 63%. We built wind turbines at our Leipzig plant, where we build our <mark>BMW</mark> i vehicles. Our Oxford plant is relying on solar energy, while our Rosslyn, South Africa plant uses biogas. In the US we use energy sources such as hydropower as well as methane gas. There are countless examples of how we are achieving our energy goal step by step.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>How does your involvement with Formula E support your <mark>BMW</mark>i/urban mobility offering?</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">While de<mark>carbon</mark>ization is the key theme of our industry, the <mark>BMW</mark> Group has a strong athletic identity in its brand and production. Our dynamic identity has always made our products stand out. Given the air quality needs of large cities, Formel E offers an interesting approach to combining racing and <mark>sustainable</mark> mobility.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>Why does <mark>BMW</mark> continue to be involved with the <mark>Sustainable</mark> <mark>Innovation</mark> Forum?</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">The <mark>BMW</mark> Group’s commitment to the <mark>Sustainable</mark> <mark>Innovation</mark> Forum is a unique tradition, and for good reason. <mark>Sustainable</mark> management is part of our corporate strategy. We have a holistic approach to sustainability across our entire value chain. At the same time, we are aware for that many goals can only be achieved in cooperation with partners and stakeholders.

				Posted on <A href=""https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/<mark>climate</mark>-change-<mark>bmw</mark>s-supply-chain-strategy-to-reduce-<mark>co2</mark>-emissions/"" rel=""bookmark"">November 14, 2017</A></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""submission__excerpt entry-summary""><P>The article explores how <mark>BMW</mark>, the most <mark>sustainable</mark> automotive company based on the Down Jones sustainability index of 2016, is able to use its supply chain as a lever to reduce <mark>CO2</mark> emissions.</P></DIV></HEADER><DIV class=""submission__content entry-content""><P>Automotive manufactures need to reduce <mark>CO2</mark> emissions to remain competitive in the current business environment. On one hand, strict regulation is forcing automotive companies to rethink their manufacturing processes to comply with the new rules. On the other hand, a growing penetration of electric vehicles with a more environmentally conscious supply chain, puts additional pressure on the conventional car industry. Therefore, a key management concern is how to reduce <mark>CO2</mark> emissions and become more <mark>sustainable</mark> across all of the company’s processes. Supply chain processes are key in this strategy since traditional supply chain emissions can be greater than those from direct operations.</P><P><mark>BMW</mark> is the example of a company that is redefining its business model in reaction to the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>. In 2016, <mark>BMW</mark> was named the world’s most <mark>sustainable</mark> automotive company by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index<A href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</A>. The company aims to reduce at least 50% of its <mark>CO2</mark> emissions by 2020<A href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"">[2]</A>. In order to do so, <mark>BMW</mark> is focusing on four key areas of its business supply chain.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Development of a <mark>sustainable</mark> strategy and organization in supply chain</EM></STRONG><EM> </EM></P><P><mark>BMW</mark>’s 2020 vision includes sustainability as a key area of development. <EM>The <mark>BMW</mark> Group is the most successful and s<U>ustainable</U> premium provider of individual mobility<A href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3""><STRONG>[3]</STRONG></A>.</EM> To achieve its vision, the company has created a Sustainability Board that is in charge of executing the sustainability strategy and cascading it to the rest of the organization. Specifically, in supply chain, the company has set its 2020 goal to <EM>Develop</EM><EM>a <mark>sustainable</mark> resource efficient supply chain<A href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4""><STRONG>[4]</STRONG></A></EM>.  To execute its goal the company has established a decentralized sustainability team in the supply chain area with key short term and medium-term goals.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Increased supply chain transparency</EM></STRONG></P><P>By 2020 The <mark>BMW</mark> Group plans to increase supply chain transparency through the <EM>Supplier Sustainability Standards, </EM>which establishes the minimum requirements a supplier needs to meet to work with <mark>BMW</mark>. In order to ensure compliance, the company has created an industry wide sustainability questionnaire in which it analyzes the supplier overall commitment with sustainability. The questionnaire is a key resource for decision making in the tendering process.</P><P>In addition, <mark>BMW</mark> encourages its suppliers to report their <mark>CO2</mark> emission targets. In 2016, 69% of <mark>BMW</mark>’s suppliers publicly reported their emissions<A href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"">[5]</A>. With these metrics, <mark>BMW</mark> can benchmark and push suppliers to achieve specific sustainability goals. <mark>BMW</mark>’s plan for 2020 is the requirement that all suppliers report their sustainability metrics. By doing this the company is indirectly generating competition among suppliers to become more <mark>sustainable</mark>.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Training suppliers</EM></STRONG></P><P>In order to help suppliers achieve sustainability standards, <mark>BMW</mark> has created a training program for suppliers. During 2016, more than 150 purchasers<A href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"">[6]</A> participated in <mark>BMW</mark>’s trainings.  Moreover, <mark>BMW</mark> identified key suppliers with high <mark>CO2</mark> emissions and designed specific trainings for those suppliers. In addition to these training programs, <mark>BMW</mark> started a sustainability awareness program in which they participate in industry wide events with key talks on sustainability. By 2020, the company expects to increase the number of supplier trainings and expand its awareness programs to Latin America and USA.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Reduction in the consumption of key supply chain resources</EM></STRONG></P><P>In order to excel in its production processes, <mark>BMW</mark> has set a goal for the supply chain to<EM>: reduce its resource consumption (energy, water, waste, solvents) per vehicle produced by 45% by 2020<A href=""#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7""><STRONG>[7]</STRONG></A>. </EM>The role of the supply chain team to achieve this objective is to find more efficient sources of energy and to identify opportunities of vertical integration to reduce energy consumption. For instance, 63% of the company energy purchases in 2016 came from <mark>sustainable</mark> energy sources that at the same time are low <mark>CO2</mark> emissions.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Post 2020 goals</EM></STRONG></P><P>Post 2020 the company has different specific areas of action to become more <mark>sustainable</mark>: Become a leader in the electric car market, implement vertical integration of suppliers to reduce <mark>CO2</mark> emissions and monitor supplier sustainability metrics through digital platforms.<A href=""#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"">[8</A></P><P><STRONG><EM>Additional suggested actions</EM></STRONG></P><P>I would recommend that <mark>BMW</mark> act across two dimensions to in response to <mark>climate change</mark> and the increased pressure on its supply chain. First, <mark>BMW</mark> should try to develop pilots for purchasing non-conventional materials for car manufacturing. For instance, develop prototypes to replace aluminum and cobalt (which are high emission sourcing processes), by more green products e.g. recycled products. As a second area of action, I believe <mark>BMW</mark> should take a more drastic approach towards suppliers that don’t comply with sustainability metrics. Specifically stop sourcing from those providers or define penalties in long term contracts if the sustainability goals are not achieved.<EM> </EM></P><P><STRONG><EM>Additional important questions:</EM></STRONG></P><P>1-What additional incentives should governments implement to shift car manufacturers’ current business models towards sustainability?</P><P>2-If the electric car is not the most cost-effective solution for car manufacturers to address <mark>climate change</mark>, what other disruptive technologies are worth exploring?</P><P>(786 words)</P><P><A href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"">[1]</A> <mark>BMW</mark> press release (Munich 8 September 2016): <mark>BMW</mark> Group once again sector leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.

During that time, <mark>BMW</mark> asked owners of its electric cars if they would be willing to delay recharging them by an hour on the company's cue.</P><P>An app notified the owners when a delay was coming, and they could opt out if they needed to charge at that time.</P><P>&quot;Eighteen months later, I can unequivocally state that participation was transparent, hassle-free and mind-numbingly dull to the point that I mostly forgot about it,&quot; one participant, John Higham, wrote in a <A href=""http://insideevs.com/18-month-real-world-trial-proves-electric-vehicles-can-stabilize-the-grid/"">first person account</A> of his experience for Inside EVs.</P><P>The trial led <mark>BMW</mark> and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E), the utility for Northern California, to suggest that if electric vehicles become as popular as expected, electric vehicle demand management could become a powerful tool for supporting grid flexibility.</P><P>&quot;The overall lesson is we can use resources likes electric vehicles to help support the grid during times of peak use,&quot; said Ari Vanrenen, a spokesman for PG&amp;E.</P><P>Renewable energy experts have long held the theory that electric vehicles will play a momentous role in helping the electric grid be more flexible. EVs could be deployed to buffer uneven power generation of wind and solar. Owners might, for example, wait to charge their cars until the height of the day, when solar is most plentiful and cheapest. Or, they might delay their charging during peak hours in the early evening, when the grid is under the most stress.</P><P>As of now, customer sensitivity to prices is still an unknown quantity. While the <A href=""http://www.pgecurrents.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/PGE-<mark>BMW</mark>-iChargeForward-Final-Report.pdf""><mark>BMW</mark>-PG&amp;E partnership</A> tested only whether customers would agree to delay their demand by an hour if given a financial incentive, it offered some concrete evidence that influencing customer behavior is possible.</P><H3>How <mark>BMW</mark> Managed Demand</H3><P>For the test, PG&amp;E asked <mark>BMW</mark> to build a system that could remove 100 kilowatts of demand from the grid on short notice.</P><P>PG&amp;E could make the call at a random time. Of particular interest to the utility was whether demand could eventually be decreased during <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/14062017/solar-renewable-energy-negative-prices-california-power-grid-solutions"">peak load hours</A> of 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., when solar power is waning for the day and demand on the grid ramps up.</P><P><mark>BMW</mark>'s app would signal to customers that a one-hour delay was coming. If the car was connected to a charging station at that time, <mark>BMW</mark> could trigger the charging delay through software in the vehicle. Participants were paid $1,000 up front to participate in the study and $540 more depending on how many times their vehicle participated in the request for a one-hour delay.</P><P>If <mark>BMW</mark> could not meet the power reduction goal through delaying customer charging, it was encouraged to supply the necessary charging through its own battery storage center.</P><P>Throughout the 18-month test period, which ended in December 2016, customers were asked to delay 209 times. <mark>BMW</mark> was able to meet its obligations to reduce power about 90 percent of the time, however only 20 percent came from owner demand reduction and 80 percent come from <mark>BMW</mark>'s battery storage.   </P><H3>The Challenge of Charging Times</H3><P>While that seems far from conclusive, the results have to be seen in the context of a small pool of drivers whose vehicles would have to be connected to a charging station when the request came in. <mark>BMW</mark> found an average of only about seven of the nearly 100 cars involved were typically available to participate when a reduction request was announced. A lack of EV charging at work lowered the numbers.</P><P>If the time of the request came between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m., when cars were more likely to be plugged into their home charging stations, vehicle owners were much more likely to participate in the delay.</P><P>Since 93 percent of the participants stated that they liked the program and would be willing to participate in a similar program going forward, PG&amp;E said it was eager to conduct a larger second phase. The California Energy Commission has given <mark>BMW</mark> a grant to lead that second phase with support from PG&amp;E that has already begun.</P><P>As more and more EVs hit the road, programs like this have broad promise, the companies said.</P><P>&quot;We can extrapolate to the future likely load reduction from plug-in vehicle drivers, as EV adoption increases,&quot; said Rebecca Kiehne, a spokesman for <mark>BMW</mark> North America. &quot;If we assume 20 percent of all existing EV owners enroll in a similar program, and behave similarly, a single future event might result in a load drop big enough to power approximately 58,000 homes in California.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""tagged-with""><LABEL>Published Under:</LABEL></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

<BODY><DIV id=""main""><DIV class=""wrapper active""><DIV class=""single_post""><H1><mark>Carbon</mark> Offsets Connection to Solving <mark>Climate Change</mark></H1><H3 class=""date"">Monday, 11 June 2012</H3><P>Environmental organizations, I believe, do a notoriously poor job communicating for our audience the positive of what we do, the results we achieve and the change we accomplish, whether they focus on <mark>carbon</mark>, energy, water, smog, soil or any number of environmental problems. The ability to connect business leaders, consumers and environmental activists with the positive <mark>climate</mark> results we aim to solve is crucial. I often feel we do a better job highlighting the problem (also critical), but not on sharing the results. So I want to address how <mark>carbon</mark> offsets, or <mark>carbon</mark> credits, help reduce the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, catalyze encourage low <mark>carbon</mark> technology and help pave the way to a cleaner, more <mark>sustainable</mark> environment for all of us.</P><P>The first step is to address that a <mark>carbon</mark> offset represents a reduction of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions from a project, in a manner verified by outside third-parties and using outside third-party standards, such as the Verified <mark>Carbon</mark> Standard, American <mark>Carbon</mark> Registry and <mark>Climate</mark> Action Reserve. The paper trail for a <mark>carbon</mark> offset shows these projects reduced emissions, whether from renewable energy, energy efficiency or forestry. This is one reason we give our supporters the choice of which types of projects to support and why we remain agnostic on which type of project is ‘better’. <mark>Carbon</mark> dioxide reductions are the goal, not the project type.</P><P>It is this connection of the project to the greenhouse gas reduction (<mark>carbon</mark> offset or <mark>carbon</mark> credit) that also ties it to solving <mark>climate change</mark>. Our planet does not care either where we emit <mark>carbon</mark> emissions or where we reduce them. Bali or Boston, same impact. <mark>Climate change</mark> is not impacted differently if a reduction comes from within a company’s premises or outside its premises. (This is different for other gases such as SO<SUB>2</SUB>, which causes acid rain and has a localized and regional impact, meaning it affects the area nearer to where it is emitted.)</P><P>So another benefit, then, is that <mark>carbon</mark> offsets allow us to direct funds to reducing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions in the most cost effective manner. If <mark>carbon</mark> is <mark>carbon</mark> is <mark>carbon</mark>, then making a $100 donation going to reduce ten tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> is more efficient than the same amount reducing just five tonnes.</P><P>What’s more, this brings about technology transfer and, often, international development. Since many developing countries are very inefficient in how they generate and manage their energy use, reducing emissions in the developing world is often much more cost effective than trying to make a <mark>BMW</mark> factory in Germany even more efficient than it already is. <mark>Carbon</mark> offsets enable this transfer of assets to reduce greenhouse gases cost efficiently, while still maintaining the verification and standards necessary to know the reductions are happening.</P><P><mark>Carbon</mark> offsets also bring more people to the table in terms of education about <mark>climate change</mark> and engagement in the solution. Most developing countries are not obligated to reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions and feel a strong sense they should not have to, while they are still developing (a topic for another day). However, when a <mark>carbon</mark> offset project comes to Brazil, India or China, local businesses, policy makers and individuals get to learn about and be part of the solution. This creates both knowledge transfer and buy in. And if the company is profiting from the project, which we would hope they are, even better for buy-in.</P><P>If we are going to solve <mark>climate change</mark> in the next few decades and stop a pending disaster, we simply must reduce our emissions substantially, by as much as 50-80% by mid-century. The less scary way of putting this is for us to aim for a 2% reduction in <mark>carbon</mark> emissions annually, but first we have to stop the growth. <mark>Carbon</mark> offsets are helping solve <mark>climate change</mark> in efficient ways by directing these massive investments toward the most efficient <mark>carbon</mark> reduction opportunity while benefitting both the <mark>climate</mark> and people.. In our best scenario, this efficiency spurs greater investment than would otherwise occur, which helps drive down the costs of new, clean, low-<mark>carbon</mark> technologies and projects. Ultimately, if enough investment helps wind, solar or another technology cost less than coal (a debatable figure but also a topic for another day), market transformation will occur based on straight economics and that will be a very good day for our planet, <mark>climate</mark> and us.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

""><P>Coal versus wind? One key to how eco-friendly your e-car really is</P></DIV><P>Because of the complex batteries they use, it currently takes more energy to produce an electric car than a conventional one.</P><P>And, disposing of those batteries creates an environmental hazard.</P><P>So, how can consumers be sure they're making the right decision?</P><P><STRONG>Shifting emissions off roads - and onto power plants</STRONG></P><P>Under present conditions, the overall <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of a battery-powered car &quot;is similar to that of a conventional car with a combustion engine, regardless of its size.&quot; That's the conclusion of a 2011 study by the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (IFEU) in Heidelberg.</P><P>While less emissions are produced by the cars themselves while driving on the streets, <A href=""/en/opinion-the-myth-of-a-clean-electric-car/a-39856708""><mark>CO2</mark> is still being emitted by power plants to charge the electric cars</A>.</P><P>In Germany for example, more than half of Germany's electricity is generated from coal and gas. A person charging an electric car with what regularly comes out of a German power socket would need to drive 100,000 kilometers (62,000 miles) in order to &quot;pay off&quot; this eco-debt, and produce overall less <mark>CO2</mark> than driving a gasoline-driven car.</P><P>If the car is charged off of green electricity only, this figure is reduced to 30,000 kilometers.</P><P><STRONG>Energy-intensive battery production</STRONG></P><P>The production of electric vehicles currently poses the biggest environmental problem. According to a study by the Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics, it takes more than twice the amount of energy to produce an electric car as a conventional one.</P><P>The main reason for that is the battery. The institute estimates that each kilowatt hour of battery capacity involves 125 kilograms (276 pounds) of <mark>CO2</mark> emissions. For a 22 kilowatt-hour battery for a <mark>BMW</mark> i3, this translates into almost 3 tons of <mark>CO2</mark>.</P><P>A study by the IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute found that the <A href=""http://www.ivl.se/download/18.5922281715bdaebede9559/1496046218976/C243+The+life+cycle+energy+consumption+and+<mark>CO2</mark>+emissions+from+lithium+ion+batteries+.pdf"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon external"">greenhouse gas burden of current battery production is 150 to 200 kilograms <mark>CO2</mark> per kWh</A>. Battery manufacturing with current technology requires 350 to 650 Megajoule of energy per kWh, the study says.</P><P>Batteries also need to be made from minerals such as copper and cobalt, and rare earths like neodymium.</P><P>Mining activities in countries like China or the Democratic Republic of Congo often cause <A href=""/en/slow-progress-on-conflict-minerals/a-18844178"">human rights violations</A> and vast ecological <mark>devastation</mark>: deforestation, polluted rivers, contaminated soil.</P><P>In addition, many automakers use aluminum to build the bodies of e-cars, and a tremendous amount of energy is required to process bauxite ore into the lightweight metal.</P><DIV class=""picBox	full

In terms of the environment, the electric vehicles of today are already performing better than internal combustion engines, he points out.</P><P>&quot;And this performance is set to improve as more renewables provide clean electricity to the grid.&quot;</P><P>Then there are further considerations. The German Environmental Forecasting Institute (UPI) warns that more electric cars could cause more traffic in general.</P><P><A href=""/en/how-electric-cars-take-over-oil-rich-norway/a-37868042"">Norway is the leading country in Europe for electric vehicle</A> sales. However, as the sales of electric cars have gone up, the use of public transport to get to work dropped by 80 percent, according to the UPI.</P><P>The environmental organization Greenpeace has warned that the benefits of a conversion to e-cars would be limited if it resulted in more personal car ownership. Instead, governments should focus on <A href=""/en/take-a-ride-on-an-e-bus/a-19262114"">electrifying public transport</A>.</P><P>However, the German government and the country's car industry are still encouraging private transport, offering buyers an incentive of up to <A href=""/en/germany-sets-out-major-cash-incentive-for-electric-car-buyers/a-19266326"">4,000 Euros to buy an electric car</A>as part of a scheme to subsidize electromobility.</P><DIV class=""picBox	full

""><P>More cities need to make use of electrified public transport</P></DIV><P><STRONG>Electric greenwashing?</STRONG></P><P>Because of their indirect emissions, there has been controversy over whether electric cars can be called &quot;zero emission vehicles.&quot; It's a question with far-reaching consequences.</P><P>The EU's new <mark>CO2</mark> limits only need to be met on an average that takes account of all the different cars a manufacturer produces. By building &quot;zero emission&quot; vehicles, car-makers can also continue to sell gas guzzlers like SUVs that exceed these limits.</P><P>According to the latest research from the Mobility, Logistics and Automotive Technology Research Centre at the Free University of Brussels (VUB), a battery-powered electric vehicle that uses electricity generated by fossil fuels will emit slightly more emissions over its lifetime than a diesel-powered car - still less than a petrol car.</P><P>But e-cars that use electricity produced from renewable sources will produce up to six times less <mark>carbon</mark> emissions over their lifetimes than a petrol car.</P><P>This means that in order for the switch to e-mobility to be most effective, countries will have to transition their energy generation in parallel.</P><P>Renewables made up about 34 percent of Germany's energy mix in 2016 - by the year 2035, Germany wants 55 to 60 percent of its electricity to come from wind, solar and biomass.</P><DIV class=""picBox	full

Temperature measurements are taken by both land and sea all over the world by several international organizations. Groups like NASA, NOAA, and the UK Met Office keep and manage their own temperature data, but they all show the same thing: the earth is warming. Overall, the planet has warmed about 1.6°F since the 1880s, and the 10 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1998.

The fact that all three major dataset corroborate each other despite differences in analysis only strengthens confidence in what they show. Though 1.6°F might not sound like a big number, it has already contributed to an array of issues from melting Arctic sea ice to rising seas to shifting ecosystems, droughts and heat waves. Since the 1950s, each decade has been warmer than the last including a big jump after the 1970s.

Average new car emissions in Europe were 135.7g in 2011, almost meeting the 2015 target four years early, which environmental campaigners have cited as evidence the targets were not set low enough. On Wednesday, the EU is expected to propose a target of 95g by 2020.</P><P>Greg Archer, of campaign group Transport and Environment said: &quot;It is time for the hypocrisy to stop. <mark>BMW</mark> should stop talking up how green and efficient their cars are whilst at the same time lobbying to weaken planned regulations to improve the fuel efficiency of cars. Car buyers want more fuel-efficient vehicles, that put money in drivers pockets through lower fuel bills.&quot;</P><P>Luca Lytton, a spokesman for the independent motoring research charity the <A href=""http://www.racfoundation.org/"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">RAC Foundation</A>, said &quot;We very much support the 95g target. It's clear that a lower CO<SUB>2</SUB> target is better for British motorists' pockets. The target needs to be achievable but we think 95g is.&quot;</P><P>The car industry is split on the new EU proposals, with smaller car makers such as Fiat, Renault and Peugeot lining up with &quot;progressive&quot; makers such as Ford and Toyota against the German car makers, Volkswagen, <mark>BMW</mark> and Daimler. Paul Everitt, the chief executive of the UK motoring trade body, the SMMT, told the Guardian the 95g target was &quot;fairly comfortable&quot; – albeit &quot;technically challenging&quot; – for manufacturers.</P><P>The German car companies are understood to favour a &quot;phase-in approach&quot;, where the cut-off date for their new fleets to meet the 95g target is pushed back to 2022, with only a percentage of their fleets required to meet it in 2020 and 2021. A similar phased-in approach was used for the 2015 target – 75% of a manufacturer's fleet must meet the 2015 target by 2013.</P><P>A new version of the leaked proposals shows that additional allowances have been given to heavier and larger vehicles since the first proposals were leaked in early June.</P><P><mark>BMW</mark> declined to comment.</P><P>Sara Ayech, <mark>climate</mark> campaigner at Greenpeace, said: &quot;The new car efficiency targets being discussed by the EU this week must not let the big polluters off the hook. It's time for the European commission to face down [those] who want to water down the efficiency proposals. The UK government must push for strong car regulations.

Total cost if all were fully implemented? $27.4 trillion. That’s a lot of cash, right? However will we pay for all that? With savings, people — or deferred costs. The authors estimated total economic savings at just under $74 trillion.</P><H3 style=""text-align: center;"">Deferred Gratification</H3><P style=""text-align: justify;"">The trick, of course, is that the costs come up front. The savings often come later. Human beings seem genetically incapable of making hard choices today that will have extraordinary benefits later. Deferred gratification could be the death knell for the capitalist model prevalent in most countries today. Pie-in-the-sky projections about future savings are discounted. Either they are treated as irrelevant or derided as #FakeNews.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">The world operates on what I like to call the Wimpy Theory. Wimpy was a character in Popeye cartoons (some of you may be old enough to remember watching cartoons on television on Saturday mornings). Wimpy had one line that he used all the time. It went like this: “I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a cheeseburger today.” It’s the “kick the can down the road” theory of global management and it will kill us all if we don’t stop — all except the lucky few who can escape to Mars aboard Elon Musk’s magic carpet.</P><H3 style=""text-align: center;"">Empowerment Of Women</H3><P style=""text-align: justify;"">We have recently written some articles on <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2017/07/17/air-conditioning-use-cool-us-makes-planet-hotter/"">refrigeration</A>. We have also touched on <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2017/07/24/afghan-girls-overcome-stupid-politicians-religious-lunatics-compete-robotics-competition/"">educating girls</A> and the <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2017/06/10/male-privilege-endangers-search-<mark>climate</mark>-change-solutions/"">empowerment of women</A>. Each of those areas makes the Top 10 list in <EM>Drawdown. </EM>Electric cars are #49. Combined, educating girls and empowering women are rated as saving more <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions than any other element in the hierarchy of suggestions for combating <mark>climate change</mark> compiled by the editors.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">And yet, the US government, spurred on by the hatred and bigotry of the so-called Religious Right (which is neither, by the way), has reimposed the so-called “global gag rule” that prohibits the spending of $1 to assist women in other countries from having access to family planning services. Here at home, the US Congress is howling like a pack of jackals in search of ways to defund Planned Parenthood.</P><H3 style=""text-align: center;"">Changes In Attitude Needed</H3><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Want to make an impact in the fight to limit the ravages of <mark>climate change</mark>? Buying an electric car and putting solar panels on your roof is laudable. But advocating for women’s rights and access to adequate health care should be your first priority. What <EM>Drawdown</EM> makes abundantly clear is that putting shackles on women to satisfy some cultural notions of male privilege or the ravings of so-called religious leaders like Pat Robertson and Franklin Graham is a death warrant for the earth.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">It’s easy to throw platitudes around and advocate for our favorite fix for global warming. <EM>Drawdown</EM> shows us that fixing our attitudes about each other will be more important in the long run than all of Elon Musk’s astonishing inventions, all the solar panels, and all the Gigafactories in the world. It’s shocking to realize electric cars will eliminate only 4% of the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide added to the atmosphere in coming years compared to the combination of educating and empowering women.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Shocking it may be, but as Mark Twain once said: “It’s not what you don’t know that kills you, it’s what you know for sure that ain’t true.”</P><P><CENTER><EM><STRONG><SPAN style=""font-size: large;"">Support CleanTechnica’s work via donations on <A href=""https://www.patreon.com/CleanTechnica/overview"" rel=""nofollow""><STRONG><SPAN style=""color: #339966;"">Patreon</SPAN></STRONG></A> or <A href=""https://www.paypal.me/ImportantMedia"" rel=""nofollow""><STRONG><SPAN style=""color: #339966;"">PayPal</SPAN></STRONG></A>!</SPAN></STRONG></EM></CENTER></P></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

They sell very big, heavy, polluting cars.”</P><P>Proposed regulations would see new European cars required to emit no more on average than 95grammes of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide per kilometre by 2020, an improvement on the current target of 120g<mark>CO2</mark>/km by 2015.</P><P><STRONG>Political power</STRONG></P><P>This policy was expected to have been agreed by EU leaders at the end of June 2013, but German Chancellor Merkel <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/28/angela-merkel-eu-car-emissions"">cut a deal</A> with British Prime Minister David Cameron to block its progress.</P><P>Merkel’s logic is fairly simple. With elections scheduled for September, she did not want to be seen harming the German car industry. And <mark>BMW</mark>’s hierarchy let her know this is how any EU deal would be portrayed.</P><P>One Brussels insider, who declined to be named due to ongoing EU negotiations told RTCC: “<mark>BMW</mark>’s influence with the [German] government is very strong – it’s incredible”.</P><P>Jurgen Pieper, a European automotive expert at the Frankfurt-based Metzler Bank, sees the i3 as part of a wider push by <mark>BMW</mark> CEO Norbert Reithofer to shift to “greener cars”, but says it’s not a sign of a wider change in direction.</P><P>“As <mark>BMW</mark> still earns a lot of money with its traditional gasoline and diesel cars, it is lobbying at the same time for higher <mark>CO2</mark> targets,” he told RTCC.</P><P><STRONG>Super-credits</STRONG></P><P>Analysts believe the EU will rubberstamp an emissions limit after the German elections, but there is still considerable concern that <mark>BMW</mark>, Daimler and Audi will try and weaken the proposals.</P><P>One way is through the allocation of ‘super-credits’. This is a way of rewarding companies who invest in low <mark>carbon</mark> cars with offsets on their more polluting models.</P><P>In its most basic form, if a company produces one electric car (EV) it can ‘offset’ the emissions from a petrol or diesel vehicle.</P><P>But a ‘multiplier’ formula pushed by <mark>BMW</mark> and its allies means one EV could account for two or even three conventional cars, a plan Cecile Toubeau says would undermine the whole concept of setting emission limits.</P><P>“On the one hand you have <mark>BMW</mark> who came out saying how green they are, and on the other you have them devising the super-credits scheme that means they fundamentally don’t have to change anything they are doing,” she said.</P><P>“They can bring out a car, market it and help improve their brand, but the reality is they don’t have to shift high numbers to be able to continue selling the gas guzzlers they sell.”</P><P>Our Brussels insider agrees with this analysis, but points out that other car makers like Ford and VW are happy with the EU proposals, because their products are already at the lower end of the <mark>pollution</mark> scale.</P><P>“<mark>BMW</mark> and Daimler have been strongly trying to water the regulations down, and introduce flexibility instruments like super-credits,” they said.</P><P>“If you look at it from their point of view it makes sense, because <mark>BMW</mark> and Daimler have a very different fleet compared to other manufacturers.”</P><P>The evidence suggests that in the words of its advertisement, <mark>BMW</mark> does fear change, and is willing to go to extreme lengths to ensure it happens as slowly as possible.</P><P><STRONG>Mobility solutions</STRONG></P><P>On this basis it’s easy to dismiss <mark>BMW</mark>’s new electric cars as an expensive form of ‘greenwash’, but other analysts say this would be unfair, and inaccurate.</P><P>One of the more interesting components of the i3 is the range of mobility solutions its purchase offers to drivers, who are not just getting a car, but access to other vehicles and software to make their travels easier.</P><P>Peugeot and Daimler have similar schemes, but Peter Fuss, E&amp;Y’s Automotive Leader in Germany, says the i3 is a sign that <mark>BMW</mark> is planning for 20-30 years time, when a car will be important but only as part of a package of services.</P><P>“The customer is changing, and requiring more of this. They no longer want to own a car – they want to move from A-B in the most cost efficient way,” he told RTCC. “That means car sharing and integrated mobility, smart mobility. <mark>BMW</mark> calls it 360 degrees mobility.</P><P>“When we look back in 20 years the launch of the i3 may be a revolution, because it is changing the whole concept of the industry.”</P><P>Fuss believes the launch of a larger i8 model in 2015 will take <mark>BMW</mark> another step down the road of this ‘evolution’, which he suggests could see leading manufacturers and megacities working in harmony to develop emission free infrastructure.</P><P><mark>BMW</mark>’s reluctance to ditch its range of high emission ‘premium’ vehicles suggests it is far from ‘going green’, and still wedded to the conventional business model of car ownership, but as cities absorb more people this may – as Fuss indicates – become un<mark>sustainable</mark>.</P><P>“When you see people living in London, New York and Amsterdam attracting business, part of this is who provides the best living environment and mobility,” he said.</P><P>“When you combine this it is not just selling cars any longer. There is much more required. Who owns the mobility of the future? Car manufacturers, google, apple or leasing companies?”</P><P>Perhaps in this aspect alone, <mark>BMW</mark>, which boasts of manufacturing the ‘ultimate driving machine’, may be slightly ahead of the curve.</P><DIV class=""yarpp-related""><H3>Related posts:</H3></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

Shortly after, an international study concluded that extreme weather conditions constitute a threat to the reindeer herding culture of the Nenets people living in the Yamal Peninsula in Siberia.</P><P>“Reindeer herding cultures have been able to adapt to climatic, social and economic changes. Despite the challenges, I believe there is a future for reindeer herding,” says Associate Professor <STRONG>Timo Kumpula</STRONG>.</P><P>For several years, he’s been a member of an international research group studying the reindeer herding culture of the Yamal-Nenets people. Kumpula has also carried out extensive research into reindeer herding issues in Finland.</P><P>“For a geographer, reindeer pastures constitute an interesting topic of research. We can look at reindeer pastures from the viewpoint of lichen and draw conclusions based on that. However, reindeer husbandry is a socio-ecological system, and this makes over-grazing a difficult question, for example.”</P><P>Possible over-grazing by reindeer has been a topic of discussion in Finland and the Yamal Peninsula alike. It has been speculated that overly large reindeer flocks caused the outbreak of an anthrax epidemic in the Yamal Peninsula in spring 2016. However, another and more likely possible culprit could be the exceptionally warm summer.</P><P>“The Yamal Peninsula suffered a major anthrax epidemic in the 1940s, and dead animals were buried deep in the permafrost. Due to last summer's exceptional warmth, the active soil layer melted deeper than before, and it is suspected that this melting caused the release of anthrax pathogens.”</P><P>What does the discussion on reindeer over-grazing in Finland focus on? Several studies have established that the amount of lichen is considerably smaller in the northernmost parts of Finland than across the border in Norway. There is a reindeer fence on the Finnish-Norwegian border, preventing reindeer from moving between the two countries.</P><P>“A simple explanation is that the areas by the border on the Norwegian side are winter pastures, with reindeer grazing there only in late winter.”</P><P>On the Finnish side of the border, on the other hand, the lichen areas are summer pastures, resulting in lichen trampling and lower coverage. According to Kumpula, pasture rotation could be one solution.</P><P>“In some districts, reindeer herders practise pasture rotation, keeping winter and summer pastures separate. This prevents reindeer from trampling on fragile lichen in the summer.”</P><P>In Finland, however, the system of several reindeer owners’ associations makes pasture rotation difficult: there are 54 separate owners’ associations, each of them an independent regional administrative unit. For these associations, increasing pasture rotation would mean an increased amount of work and costs, as reindeer would have to be more intensively herded from one pasture to the next.</P><P>“Practices vary between associations. Some of them gather their reindeer inside fences for the winter and feed them there. However, there are also associations that let their reindeer graze freely, without any additional food.”</P><P>Another thing that has been totally missed in the recent over-grazing discussion is the impact of other land use on lichen pastures.  </P><P>“Most herding districts have suffered from heavy forestry, and old forests with arboreal lichens have disappeared. Arboreal lichen growing on old trees has constituted very important winter fodder for reindeer. Now that it’s gone, supplementary feeding is of course needed, and there is greater pressure on remaining ground lichen pastures.”</P><P>Lichen is only one indicator used in analysing the condition of pastures. Preliminary research findings suggest that reindeer also play a significant role in preventing the growth of shrubs in fell areas.</P><P>Kumpula and researcher <STRONG>Teemu Tahvanainen </STRONG>have studied the effects of reindeer pasturage on ground vegetation in the operating area of the Näkkälä reindeer owners’ association in Enontekiö, Finnish Lapland. In the early 2000s, 15 experimental fences were set up, and the preliminary findings suggest that reindeer help in keeping fell vegetation at bay.</P><P>“In the experimental areas, willows have started to gain length. In Norway, shrub vegetation was higher in the fell areas, possibly contributing to the fact that snow melts away sooner there. This, in turn, affects global warming.”</P><P>Global warming constitutes a challenge for the traditional reindeer herding culture of the Nenets people in the Yamal Peninsula in particular. In winter 2013–2014, exceptionally large areas used for reindeer pasturing froze after heavy rain, resulting in the death of more than 60,000 reindeer.</P><P>The pasture areas froze because of exceptionally low ice coverage in the Barents Sea and the Kara Sea, and that brought humid air masses to land and caused rain on snow.</P><P>“If the sea remains open longer and more often, these kinds of climatic phenomena will become increasingly frequent. Pasture freezing is more common towards the west, but <mark>climate change</mark> is moving the boundary of unsettled weather conditions increasingly eastwards,” Kumpula says.</P><P>In Fennoscandia, pasture freezing is not that significant a problem for reindeer herding, as there is a possibility to provide reindeer with additional food.</P><P>“In the Yamal Peninsula, however, providing additional food is not a possibility, as the area doesn’t have fields or an extensive road infrastructure. If widespread pasture freezing becomes common in the Yamal Peninsula, making additional food available to reindeer could be a solution for preventing large-scale reindeer deaths.”</P><P>However, if reindeer herders continue to struggle with <mark>climate</mark>-related problems, the traditional livelihood may lose its appeal among the younger generations.</P><P>“So far, the younger generations have wanted to continue reindeer herding and living on the tundra.”</P><P>The study on the effects of pasture freezing on reindeer husbandry in the Yamal Peninsula was published in Biology Letters in November 2016. The study constituted part of a series of studies led by the Arctic Centre of the University of Lapland, with the University of Eastern Finland participating in them.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""footerwrapper""><DIV class=""socialwrapper""><DIV class=""social""><SPAN class=""soclabel"">Follow UEF:</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Infectious diseases are spreading faster due to warmer temperatures, <A href=""https://theconversation.com/conflict-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change-lead-to-a-rise-in-global-hunger-84999"">hunger and malnourishment is worsening</A>, allergy seasons are getting longer and sometimes it’s simply too hot for farmers to tend to their crops. </P><P>But what would happen if we treated <mark>climate change</mark> as a health problem rather than an environmental one?</P><P>As an expert in the political economy of <mark>climate change</mark>, I contend we can learn useful lessons from some relatively successful public health campaigns. Take smoking, for example.</P><P>We have successfully used advertising bans and warnings on cigarette packages to change perceptions about the dangers of burning tobacco, so perhaps a similar strategy will work to focus on the dangers of burning gasoline and diesel.</P><P>After all, most of <A href=""https://<mark>climate</mark>.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/""><mark>climate change</mark> is caused</A> because humans are burning fossil fuels at prodigious rates. This combustion generates <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. It’s accumulating rapidly in the atmosphere, warming the planet and making storms, heatwaves and droughts an <A href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/<mark>climate</mark>-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html"">increasing problem for people</A> in <A href=""http://time.com/4884648/<mark>climate</mark>-change-india-temperatures/"">many</A><A href=""https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vb7mqa/phoenix-will-be-almost-unlivable-by-2050-thanks-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">places</A>.</P><H2><mark>Climate</mark> health warning</H2><P>Cigarette advertising was actively promoting a hazardous product, and so the public health case was made for restricting advertising of cigarettes. Alarmed by the damage to human health caused by tobacco smoking, public authorities gradually transformed the public image of cigarettes from symbols of sophistication into objects of danger. Social life has now been largely disconnected from smoking.</P><P>Many countries require packaging that alerts smokers to the dangers of the “cancer sticks” they are purchasing, and many cartons carry dire health warnings. In some cases, images of the grievous bodily harm caused by prolonged exposure to tobacco smoke must be printed on cigarette cartons. It’s all designed to discourage smoking and make plain the damage it causes.</P><FIGURE class=""align-center ""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">Cigarette packages in Canada and other countries now feature dire and graphic warnings.</SPAN><SPAN class=""attribution""><SPAN class=""source"">(The Canadian Press/Graham Hughes)</SPAN></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Campaigns against smoking have also emphasized the dangers to third parties, and children in particular, when they inhale second-hand smoke.</P><P>Now there are health hazards from another form of combustion. The health impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> are clear. So, perhaps it’s time to adapt the success of the campaign against burning and smoking tobacco to policy actions against burning gasoline and diesel in vehicles.</P><P>Like cigarettes used to be, internal combustion-engined vehicles are ubiquitous. According to advertisers, their possession and use apparently infers social status. Equated with freedom, despite the amount of time drivers spend stuck in traffic, gasoline-burning cars are supposedly the ultimate symbol of individualism, autonomy and power.</P><P>Here’s an example of a car ad that glamourizes driving:</P><P>But cars are hazardous to both the driver and other people as well. Internal combustion engines generate urban <mark>pollution</mark>. They cause <mark>climate change</mark>. Everyone is endangered by <mark>climate change</mark> whether they drive or not. <mark>Climate change</mark> is the automobile equivalent of second-hand smoke.</P><H2>Ban car advertising?</H2><P>So, how about a ban on advertising internal combustion engine-powered vehicles? No longer could they be shown as a symbol of glamour and sophistication to young people. Instead, the consequences of their widespread use could be highlighted.</P><P>Cigarette packaging displays health warnings, so why not have gasoline- and diesel-fueled cars decorated with images of disasters, floods, damaged buildings, hurricane <mark>devastation</mark> and the like?</P><P>Consumer choice need not be unduly restricted here. If people really want to buy this increasingly outdated technology, then regulations could easily allow each model of car to be sold with a choice of flood, pestilence, drought or fire damage decor.</P><P>The car companies would no doubt protest, as did the tobacco firms before them. But the larger public health concerns are much more important than automobile producers’ business plans.</P><P>While these practical measures alone won’t alone solve the <mark>climate change</mark> problem, they would surely help people focus on the need to move rapidly away from internal combustion engines and towards a safer and more healthy world.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The car company will also be making larger commitments with the possibility of taking a greater equity stake. Initially, the plan was to invest $60,000 alongside <A class=""crunchbase-link"" href=""https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hax-accelerator/"" target=""_blank"" data-type=""organization"" data-entity=""hax-accelerator"">Hax </A> in graduates from the incubator.</P><P>With Urban Us, that number is $100,000 and the equity stake that Urban-X will take will vary depending on the startup, according to Kotch.</P><P>“We really learned from the first two for an upgraded program,” said Kotch. “Previously when we ran the program there was a fixed amount of capital for a fixed amount of equity… now we can invest up to $100,000 for a variable amount of equity as long as valuation doesn’t exceed $5 million.”</P><P>The program is also longer. With Hax, the Urban-X program was three months long, the new accelerator program lasts five months, and has a way to help with more funding down the line.</P><P>Finally, partnering with Urban Us also gives MINI flexibility for follow-on financing in concert with Urban Us to track the company through its growth, said Kotch.</P><P>For its part, Urban Us gets to pursue its investment thesis with a fellow traveler, according to the firm’s co-founder Stonly Baptiste (who first presented the tie up onstage at our Disrupt conference in New York).</P><DIV id=""attachment_1492642"" style=""width: 1034px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Stonly Baptiste (Urban Us) at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2017</P></DIV><P>“We already have a lot of confidence and a great relationship with Micah,” Baptiste said. “The history was with Urban-X goes back to its inception… we heard rumblings.”</P><P>While Urban-X focused on one geography, Urban Us created a distributed network of interested investors and entrepreneurs. “We opted to focus on investing in a more geographically dispersed network and building an online community to take the time to understand what an urban technology ecosystem might look like globally,” Baptiste said.</P><P>The two men envision an investment platform where the incubator can make small pre-seed and seed commitments on which the Urban Us fund will follow. Then if it’s warranted, <A class=""crunchbase-link"" href=""https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/<mark>bmw</mark>/"" target=""_blank"" data-type=""organization"" data-entity=""<mark>bmw</mark>""><mark>BMW</mark>’s </A> own iVentures platform could eventually be involved in financing some of the companies.</P><P>That said, Urban-X has a broader mandate than its later stage corporate counterpart. While <mark>BMW</mark>’s investments are focused on mobility, Urban X can look at connected living, or energy, or food waste as potential theses that it can invest in.</P><P>Other large investors are getting into the urban tech space. General Catalyst made an investment in HubHaus a shared, co-living company that shared the stage with Baptiste at TechCrunch’s Disrupt New York event.</P><P>MINI’s partnership with Urban Us on the Urban X initiative is happening despite an increasingly harsh view of the current White House toward notions of <mark>climate change</mark> — and the tax benefits that would promote companies look to ameliorate the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“Whatever winds the national or international political thoughts are moving in… with good engineering and design you can solve real problems that are urgent and pressing,” says Kotch.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Comte fell into fashion photography when, in 1980, Karl Lagerfeld asked the then 25-year-old to shoot a Chloé campaign. Since then, he’s worked with Givenchy, Nike, <mark>BMW</mark>, Hennessy, and many others, and photographed Jeremy Irons, Mike Tyson, Miles Davis, Helena Christensen, Naomi Campbell, Louise Bourgeois, and Sharon Stone. Before, during, and after this era of editorial and commercial work, however, the Swiss artist developed—and continues to explore—another interest: <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>Now Rome museum <A href=""http://www.maxxi.art/en/"" target=""_blank"">The Maxxi</A> is hosting Comte’s never-before-seen series <I> Light</I>. An avid mountaineer, the artist has spent more than 30 years documenting the rapid changes of glacial landscapes, from the Himalayas to Mount Kilimanjaro. In the exhibition, viewers will confront environmental flashpoints in close-up images of pristine, silvery landscapes that look like the products of Photoshop manipulation. Also on show are sculptures, installations, and projections. And later this month, he’ll also present <I> Black Light</I><I>, White Light</I> an expansion of <I> Light</I>, at the <A href=""http://www.triennale.org/en/"" target=""_blank"">Triennale di Milano</A>. </P><P>Above: The exterior of The Maxxi, National Museum of the 21st Century Arts, Rome, with a projection of Michael Comte's <I>Light. </I>Video mapping by Manuel Savoia.

My grandfather was one of Swissair’s three founders. His co-pilot took the very first series of photographs of the Swiss glaciers in 1914, and my grandfather and I looked at pictures from that period when I was growing up. I was also an active mountaineer until an accident in the French mountains in which my best friend was killed as we were hiking together. After that, I kept climbing, but not extreme climbing, and I began to record the mountain landscapes, in particular the glaciers.</P><DIV class=""article__media""><PICTURE class=""article__image""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 25em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 40.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 53.125em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 65.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x""><DIV class=""article__image-caption"">From Michael Comte's <I>Light</I>, 2017. The K2 region of the Himalayas</DIV></SOURCE></SOURCE></SOURCE></SOURCE></PICTURE></DIV><P><B> So your interest in environmentalism must’ve predated your fashion work. How did <I> Light</I>, specifically, come about?</B> In 1975, before even starting university, I wrote an essay about the limits of growth called “Water Is the Oil of the Future” and was invited to speak in front of <A href=""https://www.clubofrome.org/"" target=""_blank"">The Club of Rome</A>, one of the first organizations concerned about the environment. Then, in 1986, I spent a year in the Tibetan Himalayas. I met a group of Chinese scientists at a very remote monastery and we talked about water. They told me: “The reason China is in Tibet has nothing to do with the Dalai Lama or religion. The Chinese are here because Tibet is the water reserve for China’s future.” These scientists predicted a great ice melt between the years 2005 and 2010. </P><P>I returned to Switzerland and found scientific data that confirmed the glaciers were retreating 20 centimeters a year. This intrigued me and it’s why I decided to inspect all of the glaciers in the Himalayas over a period of two years. What I discovered was shocking. I went to one glacier and a year later 50 <I> meters</I> were lost, not 20 centimeters. I went to another glacier and, in one year, we lost 300 meters. I went to British Columbia and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro; there was no snow in some places. I thought to myself, “Wow, we really have a problem,” and that was how this project was born.</P><DIV class=""article__media""><PICTURE class=""article__image""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 25em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 40.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 53.125em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 65.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x""><DIV class=""article__image-caption"">From Michael Comte's <I>Light</I>, 2017.

Between 1996 and 2001, I contributed to the construction of the orthopedic center in Kabul. I was part of the International Red Cross committee for many years.

Fog in the K2 region</DIV></SOURCE></SOURCE></SOURCE></SOURCE></PICTURE></DIV><P><B> At what point did you also become interested in film, sculpture, and installation?</B>I became interested in different kinds of art at a very early age. In the 1970s, I was in the States and went to the Mohave Desert where I saw Michael Heizer’s <I> Double Negative. </I>I also liked the stone pieces that [Joseph] Beuys did and I was very taken by Robert Smithson’s <I> Spiral Jetty </I>and Walter De Maria’s <I> Lightning Field.</I> I was also a producer of <I> Trouble Makers </I>(<I>The Story of Land Art</I>), a film by James Crump. I’ve always been obsessed with land art as a form of contemporary art, and <I> Light </I>is extremely related to this.</P><P><B> What prompted you to leave fashion behind and focus on art?</B> You know, I don’t like retrospectives. I get tired of the same questions being asked over and over. I especially disliked the stigma of being a “star photographer.” It was always the worst thing anyone could ever call me. I never ever felt I was working with stars. My relationships with many of the people I worked with lasted 25 to 30 years. People like Louise Bourgeois, Jeremy Irons, Ben Kingsley, Sophia Loren, and William Defoe, for me, were not only celebrities; they were so much more. When an assignment had a celebrity angle, it had to be fascinating in a strange way, like Sharon Stone—those pictures were mad. </P><P>This “star” stigma is one of the things I’ve been working to get rid of. It was very difficult and involved building new relationships with galleries and museums based on a very different perception of me and my work. I am now working with great museums that give me creative freedom and <A href=""https://galerieursmeile.com/contemporary-chinese-art-beijing-china-lucerne-switzerland.html"" target=""_blank"">Galerie Urs Meile</A>, Beijing, represents my work worldwide. So it has been an unusual path, it’s taken a lot of hard work, and I’ve had to invest a lot of time and money, but I do it because I am passionate about contemporary art—and about my subject.</P><DIV class=""article__media""><PICTURE class=""article__image""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 25em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612705691-michel-comte_light_2017_0014138.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612705691-michel-comte_light_2017_0014138.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 40.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612705691-michel-comte_light_2017_0014138.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612705691-michel-comte_light_2017_0014138.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 53.125em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612705691-michel-comte_light_2017_0014138.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612705691-michel-comte_light_2017_0014138.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 65.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612705691-michel-comte_light_2017_0014138.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612705691-michel-comte_light_2017_0014138.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x""><DIV class=""article__image-caption"">From Michael Comte's <I>Light</I>, 2017.

</LI><LI>Put sharps containers in the recycling bin.</LI></UL><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Who is allowed to ship used sharps through the mail?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Homeowners and small quantity <mark>BMW</mark> generators (those who produce less than fifty pounds of sharps per month) may ship their used sharps via the mail. In CT, sharps are the only kind of <mark>BMW</mark> that may be shipped through the mail. This is usually accomplished via mail-back services that send a special container for their customers to use.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Who can accept <mark>BMW</mark> from households?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Hospitals and regional hazardous waste collection facilities can legally accept <mark>BMW</mark> generated by households. Check first with a local hospital or your town to see if there is a facility that does so.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Is <mark>BMW</mark> generated by visiting health care nurses at homes of patients regulated by the DEEP?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Yes. <mark>BMW</mark> generated in the home during the administration of medical care (e.g. sharps, IV bags, etc.) is regulated. We also encourage healthcare providers to accept <mark>BMW</mark> generated by their patients, since many patients lack knowledge of proper disposal techniques.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">How should <mark>BMW</mark> be disposed?</P></I></B><P align=""left""><mark>BMW</mark> must be packaged, labeled, and marked as required by state regulations. Generators and permitted <mark>BMW</mark> transporters must deliver the waste to a permitted &quot;<mark>BMW</mark> treatment facility&quot; to store, treat, or dispose the waste. The methods of treatment/ disposal are as follows:</P></LI><LI>Chemotherapy waste – by incineration 
</LI><LI>Pathological waste (i.e. human tissue, organs, body parts) – by incineration 
</LI><LI>Infectious waste (i.e. body fluids or items dripping with body fluids, discarded sharps, <mark>BMW</mark> generated from research, etc.) – either by incineration, discharge to a sanitary sewer, treatment by steam sterilization or other alternative treatment technology. </LI><P align=""left""><mark>BMW</mark> may be treated in accordance with methods specified in the regulations. If treated, <mark>BMW</mark> must be rendered unrecognizable in order to be disposed as municipal solid waste.</P><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Can I dispose <mark>BMW</mark> in a sewer?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Yes, but chemotherapy and pathological waste must NOT be disposed in a sewer under any conditions. Only infectious wastes that are not pathological or generated from chemotherapy can be discharged to a sanitary sewer, provided the waste is in liquid or in semi-solid form, the sewage treatment plant does not prohibit the discharge and secondary treatment is provided and all discharge permits are obtained.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">What are CT’s <mark>BMW</mark> packaging and labeling requirements?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Before transporting <mark>BMW</mark>, the generator must:</P></LI><LI>Place the waste in a red bag to render it universally recognizable as <mark>BMW</mark>. 
</LI><LI>Package it in rigid, leak and moisture resistant containers. 
</LI><LI>Use a container that is strong enough to avert tearing or bursting under normal circumstances and seal it to prevent leakage. 
</LI><LI>Make sure each container displays the universal biohazard symbol or the words &quot;BIOHAZARD&quot; in large, easy-to-read lettering. 
</LI><LI>Never reuse a container that housed <mark>BMW</mark> for any purpose unless: 
</LI><LI>its surfaces were protected from contamination through the use of a liner or bag that was removed with the waste, or 
</LI><LI>it has been thoroughly washed and disinfected, with all visible traces of prior contamination removed.</LI></OL><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">How should <mark>BMW</mark> be stored?</P></I></B><P align=""left""><mark>BMW</mark> must be stored so that it avoids being mixed with other materials, and access to it must be limited to personnel authorized by the generator, transporter, or <mark>BMW</mark> treatment facility operator to handle it. Outdoor storage areas, such as dumpsters, sheds, or trailers, must be locked. The areas used for storage must be constructed of finished materials that are impermeable and can be easily maintained in a sanitary condition.</P><P align=""left""><mark>BMW</mark> storage should be in a manner and location that protects it from water, precipitation, wind, animals, and does not provide a breeding place or food source for insects or rodents. <mark>BMW</mark> may be refrigerated during storage to maintain a non-putrescent state. Finally, a sign displaying the universal biohazard symbol and/or the words &quot;BIOHAZARD&quot; must be posted wherever <mark>BMW</mark> is stored.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">What should be done with used <mark>BMW</mark> containers?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Disposable containers must be disposed with the <mark>BMW</mark>. Reusable containers must be cleaned and decontaminated prior to usage.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Can other types of waste be mixed with <mark>BMW</mark>?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Yes, but with varying processing rules. If <mark>BMW</mark> is mixed with hazardous waste it is regulated as hazardous waste. Likewise, if it is mixed with radioactive waste it is subject to radioactive waste regulations. If <mark>BMW</mark> is mixed with other forms of solid waste, then the combined waste must be managed as <mark>BMW</mark>. However, properly treated <mark>BMW</mark> from approved treatment facilities that is physically unrecognizable may be disposed as municipal solid waste.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Are <mark>BMW</mark> generators required to implement a written <mark>BMW</mark> Management Plan?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Yes. A <mark>BMW</mark> Management Plan must be written for each facility and contain policies and procedures for the segregation, mixture, treatment, and disposal of <mark>BMW</mark>. An OSHA Exposure Control Plan may suffice if it provides for these policies and procedures.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">May I transport / treat <mark>BMW</mark> without a permit in CT?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Any person in the business of transporting <mark>BMW</mark> must obtain a <mark>BMW</mark> transporter permit issued by the DEEP pursuant to RCSA section 22a-209-15(g). Homeowners and small quantity <mark>BMW</mark> generators may transport their own waste under specific conditions. See the <mark>BMW</mark> regulations for more details.</P><P align=""left""><mark>BMW</mark> treatment facilities located in CT must also obtain a DEEP permit. To receive the most current list of permitted transporters/ treatment facilities contact the DEEP or visit our website.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">What are the <mark>BMW</mark> tracking requirements?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">A generator who transports or offers for transport <mark>BMW</mark> must use the tracking form in Appendix 1 of RCSA section 22a-209-15 to track its movement from the site of generation to a permitted <mark>BMW</mark> treatment facility. It is necessary to prepare at least the number of copies that will provide the generator and each transporter with one copy, and the operator or each <mark>BMW</mark> treatment facility where the waste is headed with two copies. A transporter may not accept <mark>BMW</mark> without a tracking form. For exceptions to the rules and more detailed guidelines, see RCSA section 22a-209-15(h).</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">I am a licensed hazardous waste transporter. Do I need a separate permit to transport <mark>BMW</mark>?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Yes. CT requires separate permits for transporting hazardous and <mark>BMW</mark>.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Are trauma scene responders subject to <mark>BMW</mark> requirements?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">No, but any <mark>BMW</mark> generated at the scene must be managed in accordance with the <mark>BMW</mark> regulations. Entities engaged in this business should provide appropriate training to their employees and contract with a licensed transporter to ensure compliance with current regulations.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Are ambulance or emergency service vehicles allowed to transport <mark>BMW</mark> to any hospital?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Yes. Many hospitals accept <mark>BMW</mark> that comes in with the trauma victim. If the ambulance does not have the time or resources to transport <mark>BMW</mark>, emergency service vehicles may also take it to the hospital. If the hospital refuses to accept the waste, entities should either take it back to their own facility for eventual pickup by a <mark>BMW</mark> transporter or drop the waste off at a permitted treatment facility.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Should hospitals let patients take home <mark>BMW</mark> (limbs, organs, etc.)?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">The DEEP is aware that hospitals may get requests from patients to take home their pathological waste for religious or other reasons. However, since hospitals bear the responsibility for <mark>BMW</mark> generated at its facility, allowing this practice places the public in danger of improper disposal. Hospitals should exercise caution and restraint when deciding on this delicate matter by doing their best to educate their patients about proper disposal techniques.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">What should be done to clean up a <mark>BMW</mark> spill?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Secure the spill area with personnel using protective equipment described in RCSA section 22a-209-15(e). Damaged containers and spilled <mark>BMW</mark> must be placed into red plastic bags that meet the requirements outlined in the regulations. Spill responders must decontaminate the affected area and take any other appropriate clean-up measures. Finally, any reusable equipment used in the clean-up process must be cleaned and decontaminated; non-reusable equipment must be appropriately bagged, and disposed. For more details call the DEEP’s Emergency Response and Spill Prevention Section at (860) 424-3024. </P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">What should I do if I come across suspected <mark>BMW</mark>?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Do not handle the waste yourself. You should call your <A href=""http://www.ct.gov/dph/cwp/view.asp?a=3123&amp;q=397740"">town’s health department</A> or the DEEP’s Emergency Response and Spill Prevention Section at (860) 424-3024.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">How should waste generated from a veterinarian’s office be treated?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Objects from animals known or suspected to have been exposed to infectious diseases (such as blood-soaked bedding, etc.), or any other <mark>BMW</mark> generated from treatment or research in a veterinary hospital must be managed as infectious waste and incinerated.<STRONG>Questions?</STRONG>  If you have questions about biomedical waste, call our toll-free compliance assistance hotline at 1-888-424-4193, Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (except state holidays).<FONT size=""1"">Content Last Updated June 30, 2015</FONT></P></LI></DSFCONTENT></BODY></HTML>"

I stress here the word, “known”, as statisticians are able to say that, as there are trillions of planets in the universe, millions of them must support life. We also know of many planets, orbiting stars, which are said to be, “Goldilocks” planets, as they are, as Goldilocks would say, just right. But they are only just right as far as the position and size go, for liquid water, and surface gravity, as we have no idea, really, whether they could support life, or not. Add into these uncertainties, the fact that the nearest star is 4 light years away, which is approximately 24 trillion miles, and all of these, so-called, “Goldilocks planets”, are much further away than that. The nearest is about 12 light years away. Our current methods of space travel, allow speeds of around 160,000 mph, using  gravitational slingshots, but by rockets alone, can only reach around 30,000 mph. It would take about 15,000 years to get to even the nearest star, by current technology, making those “Goldilocks” planets as much of a fairy-tale as the original story.</P><P align=""justify"">So let’s focus on the real story, which is our own little planet Earth , which, as I said, is the only planet in the universe known to be able to support life, and the only home we have. On the Earth we have just the right temperature. Our position relative to the sun should make the Earth a relatively cold planet, an ice planet, rather than the blue planet we know today. During the ice age it was a cold planet, and what we believe ended that was a change in the Earth’s atmosphere through volcanic activity, which caused more of the Sun’s radiant energy to be retained. So, now, we have the right temperature, just about the right amount of water, and land, just the right solid composition, and at this distance from the sun, we have just the right atmosphere. This is an atmosphere just right for both us, and plants, to symbiotically coexist, in the constant exchange of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, and oxygen between us. The Earth has just the right humidity, and the right conditions for rainfall. It has the magnetic field that prevents the solar wind from blowing our atmosphere away. We have the ozone layer which protects us from savage levels of ultraviolet radiation. So, all of this is just right, as Goldilocks would say, and the Earth is really the only planet we can say, with any certainty, is “The Goldilocks planet”.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Life and Water</H5><P align=""justify"">The conditions for the survival of life on this planet are so precarious and unusual that our existence is something of a miracle. Look at the behaviour of water, for example. We all learn at school that as things get colder they contract, and having the same mass, are therefore more dense. Water behaves in the same way, but when it reaches 4°C, it starts to expand again, and become less dense, so that the solid form of water, ice, is less dense than the water, and floats on the top of it. In the winter, instead of the coldest water falling to the bottom and freezing at the bottom, it is the water at 4°C that falls to the bottom, so ice, which is less dense, forms on the top. This allows aquatic creatures to survive in the liquid water at the bottom. So, if it were not for the peculiar behaviour of water, aquatic life and therefore, possibly, life on land, would not have been possible. This just adds to all those other things I have mentioned, the ozone layer, the magnetic field, and so on, without which, our life would not be possible, and which make this planet Earth so unique.</P><H5 align=""justify"">The Tree of Knowledge, and The Garden of Eden</H5><P align=""justify"">In the past few hundred years there has been a great evolution in awareness, of the nature of our planet. Prior to Copernicus and Galileo people thought that the Earth was at the very centre of the entire universe, and even that the Earth was the entire universe, with the sun and moon being lights put into the sky by God for the convenience of mankind. The stars were merely fairy lights to decorate the night sky for our amusement. It was a very comforting picture, and that we, like little children on our playground, were being looked over by the great Father God, to see that all was well, and no harm could come to us.</P><P align=""justify"">Since the time it was accepted that Copernicus, and Galileo, were correct, and that the Earth travels around the sun, we have made more and more startling discoveries about the nature of the universe, and now know that the Earth is no more than a speck of dust in a boiling cauldron of chaos. If cosmologists are correct, eventually the stars will all fade, one by one, and the universe will become an infinite, lifeless, expanse of nothingness, and darkness, enduring for ever. This is all quite a dramatic shift of perspective for us to have to face, and, just as in the Garden of Eden, eating from the Tree of Knowledge has cast us out from childlike innocence, to an adulthood, full of insecurity, and uncertainty.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Grown-up Responsibilities, and Challenges</H5><P align=""justify"">We know that the conditions for the survival of life on this planet are so precarious and unusual that our life is much more of a miracle than it seemed, even in those comforting days when we thought the Earth was our playground, permanent, safe, and secure. We now have to understand that the continuance of life on this planet is our responsibility, and considering the supreme idiocy, carelessness, and ignorance, displayed by so many, the thought that our survival depends on all people, and nations, cooperating is a scary thought.</P><P align=""justify"">There are known hazards that we will have to deal with sometime in the future. We might, or might not, survive the merging of the Milky Way galaxy with Andromeda, which is hurtling towards us. At some time in the future, all the hydrogen in the sun will have been converted to helium, at which point the precarious balance between gravity, and the explosive outpourings of energy from the sun, will shift to allow an expansion, and our Sun will become a red giant, and our little planet Earth, a glowing ember inside the Sun’s outer atmosphere. Before that, the Earth’s core might cease to generate the magnetic field, which protects us from the ferocious solar wind emanating from the Sun, and all our atmosphere might be swept away. Before that, super-volcanoes, such as at Yellowstone national park in the USA might erupt, filling the atmosphere with ash, and blotting out the sun’s warmth for months.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Rocks in Space</H5><P align=""justify"">In the 18th C, when scientists thought that planetary motion worked just like their clockwork models, with perfect spheres moving in perfect circles, in perfectly empty space, the idea that shooting stars might be pieces of space rock burning up in the atmosphere, was refuted by the bland statement, by the French Scientist, Antoine <EM>Lavoisier</EM>, “Stones cannot fall from the sky, because there are no stones in the sky.” This is a good illustration of how we tend to impose our concepts upon reality, and refuse to see what is in front of our faces. Now we know that there are countless millions of rocks, hurtling about in space, and the Earth could be struck by one at any time, with catastrophic consequences. There are people monitoring all those near-Earth objects, but, so far, we have not come up with any concerted effort to ensure that we would be able to do anything about any one of them being on a collision course with our planet.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Initiative Test</H5><P align=""justify"">Although there are so many hazards in the future there is one hazard that is with us right now, and if there were a Father God, it is just the sort of thing they might have come up with as an initiative test, a kind of easy one to start with, to see if mankind is capable of co-operating, and working together, in a rational way, to overcome a simple problem, before we have to go on to survive much more difficult problems in the future. So, how are we doing? Not very well I fear.</P><H5 align=""justify"">When Did we First Know About Global Warming?</H5><P align=""justify"">Beginning with work by Joseph Fourier in the 1820s, scientists had understood that gases in the atmosphere might trap the heat received from the Sun. As Fourier said,</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px"" align=""justify"">“Energy in the form of visible light from the Sun easily penetrates the atmosphere to reach the surface and heat it up, but heat cannot so easily escape back into space, for the air absorbs invisible heat rays, (‘infra-red radiation’), rising from the surface.”</P><P align=""justify"">The warmed air radiates some of the energy back down to the surface, helping it stay warm. This would later be called the “greenhouse effect.”</P><P align=""justify"">In 1859, the Irish physicist, John Tyndall, demonstrated that some gases have the ability to absorb radiant heat, so explaining, and confirming, the greenhouse effect. Tyndall set out to find which, if any, gases in the atmosphere could absorb radiant heat. He identified several gases that did so, including water vapour, and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>).</P><P align=""justify"">Svante Arrhenius was a Swedish scientist who was the first to claim, in 1896, that burning fossil fuels might cause global warming. He hypothesised a correlation between <mark>CO2</mark> concentrations in the atmosphere and temperature. He believed that the average surface temperature of the earth is about 15°C because of the capacity of water vapour and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide to absorb radiant heat. This he called the greenhouse effect. Arrhenius suggested a doubling of the <mark>CO2</mark> concentration would lead to a 5°C temperature rise. He, and Thomas Chamberlin, calculated that human activities would warm the Earth by adding <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide to the atmosphere.</P><P align=""justify"">In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that concentrations of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide were increasing and raising global temperature. By the 1950s most scientists accepted the idea of global warming, and believed that <mark>CO2</mark> plays a crucial role in <mark>climate change</mark>, so that rising levels would have significant consequences.</P><P align=""justify"">In 1959 the Physicist, Teller, gave a warning to the US Oil Industry that burning fossil fuels could cause global warming. <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2018/01/03/edward-teller-warned-oil-industry-<mark>carbon</mark>-dioxide-<mark>climate</mark>-change-6-decades-ago/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">(See CleanTechnica Article)</A></P><P align=""justify"">He said –</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P style=""text-align: justify"">Whenever you burn conventional fuel, you create <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. [….] The <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is invisible, it is transparent, you can’t smell it, it is not dangerous to health, so why should one worry about it? <mark>Carbon</mark> dioxide has a strange property. It transmits visible light but it absorbs the infra-red radiation which is emitted from the Earth. Its presence in the atmosphere causes a greenhouse effect [….] It has been calculated that a temperature rise corresponding to a 10 per cent increase in <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. All the coastal cities would be covered, and since a considerable percentage of the human race lives in coastal regions, I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.</P><P> </P><P style=""text-align: justify"">At present the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by 2 per cent over normal. By 1970, it will be perhaps 4 per cent, by 1980, 8 per cent, by 1990, 16 per cent [about 360 parts per million, by Teller’s accounting], if we keep on with our exponential rise in the use of purely conventional fuels. By that time, there will be a serious additional impediment for the radiation leaving the earth. Our planet will get a little warmer. It is hard to say whether it will be 2 degrees Fahrenheit or only 1°, or 5°.</P><P style=""text-align: left"" align=""justify"">But when the temperature does rise by a few degrees over the whole globe, there is a possibility that the ice-caps will start melting and the level of the oceans will begin to rise. Well, I don’t know whether they will cover the Empire State Building or not, but anyone can calculate it, by looking at the map, and noting that the ice-caps over Greenland, and over Antarctica, are perhaps 5,000 feet thick.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">From July 23rd, to the 27th, 1979, a scientific assessment of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, and <mark>climate</mark>, was made, and a report produced at Woods Hole, Massachusetts USA-</P><P align=""justify""><A href=""http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/steve/charney_report1979.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/steve/charney_report1979.pdf</A></P><P align=""justify"">This was a report to the <mark>Climate</mark> Research Board, the Assembly of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the National Research Council. In that report they stated –</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">For more than a century, we have been aware that changes in the composition of the atmosphere could affect its ability to trap the sun’s energy for our benefit. We now have incontrovertible evidence that the atmosphere is indeed changing, and that we ourselves contribute to the change. Atmospheric concentrations of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide are steadily increasing, and these changes are linked with man’s use of fossil fuels and exploitation of the land. Since <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide plays a significant role in the budget of the atmosphere it is reasonable to suppose that continued increases would affect <mark>climate</mark>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">In their conclusion they stated –</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">Having examined the principal attempts to simulate the effects of increased atmospheric <mark>CO2</mark> on <mark>climate</mark>, we can assume a rate of increase that would lead to a doubling of airborne concentration at some time in the first half of the 21st-century. From this doubling we can predict a global surface warming of between 2° and 3.5° Celsius. However, it is expected that absorption of heat in the oceans, will initially mitigate the effects of warming, but that warming will eventually turn, and the associated regional climatic changes may well be significant.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">An article appeared in Inside <mark>Climate</mark> News by Neela Banerjee, Lisa Song and David Hasemyer</P><P align=""justify""><U><A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/15092015/exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/15092015/exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming</A></U></P><P align=""justify"">In the article they say –</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">In July 1977, at a meeting in Exxon Corporation’s headquarters, a senior company scientist named James F. Black delivered a sobering message: <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from the world’s use of fossil fuels would warm the planet and could eventually endanger humanity.</P><P align=""justify"">In 1978, he warned Exxon scientists and managers that independent researchers estimated a doubling of the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>) concentration in the atmosphere would increase average global temperatures by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (4 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit), and as much as 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) at the poles. Rainfall might get heavier in some regions, and other places might turn to desert.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">The article goes on to say that at first, Exxon responded by launching its own research into <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from fossil fuels, and its impact on the Earth, but then began to see it mainly as a problem that posed an existential threat to the oil business. Toward the end of the 1980s, <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/sites/default/files/documents/Exxon%20Review%20of%20<mark>Climate</mark>%20Research%20Program%20%281981%29.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><U>Exxon curtailed its <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide research</U></A>. and worked, instead, at the forefront of <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/<mark>climate</mark>-denial"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><mark>climate</mark> denial</A><U>,</U> to create doubt about the reality of global warming. It lobbied against federal and international action to control greenhouse-gas emissions, and helped to erect a vast edifice of misinformation that stands to this day. The millions of dollars Exxon had spent since the 1990s on <mark>climate change</mark> deniers had long surpassed what it had once invested in <mark>climate</mark> science.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Current <mark>Climate Change</mark> Deniers</H5><P align=""justify"">So, here we have it. Though Trump, and his administration, like to pretend that there is no such thing as global warming, that it is all a hoax invented by the Chinese, and have even eradicated all mention of it on government websites, and although the US oil industry, appears to have taken the opportunity to spread misinformation, and doubt, concerning <mark>climate change</mark>, science has been well-established starting from the early part of the 19th century, and there is absolutely no doubt that our <mark>climate</mark> is deteriorating, due to our own activities, and if these activities are not brought under control there is a very real danger that the Earth will no longer be able to support life. It seems extraordinary to me that individuals are willing, and able, to put their short-term economic interests above the continuation of life on Earth, by creating and spreading these false denials of <mark>climate change</mark>. Such is the unfathomable stupidity, and wickedness of some, living amongst us. Equally unfathomable are those who, for no better reason than to inflate their own egos, disseminate these falsehoods, on websites, social media, and comments. They add to the delay of urgent protection for all life on Earth, just so that they can pretend to be members of the inner-circle, with the “insider knowledge” that other mere mortals, including 98% of the worlds <mark>climate</mark> scientists, do not possess.</P><H5 align=""justify"">What We Need to do Now.</H5><P align=""justify"">Had we started to do something about this 50 years ago, we would not need to do much at all right now, and if the politicians had started to actually do something at the time they just started to talk about doing something, the situation would not be as desperate as it is now. So far, despite all the talk, greenhouse gas emissions are still increasing, and to make it worse, the ability of our planet to absorb the greenhouse gas emissions is also being reduced by foolish human activity. Global warming, that has already started, is, itself, causing more greenhouse gas to be released, from the thawing Tundra, for example, so creating a self accelerating process. This is accelerated further by the loss of heat reflective white surfaces at the poles, as the ice melts. All of this makes the need for our intervention very urgent, and our action needs to be immediate, robust, and extensive.</P><P align=""justify"">Every Nation, needs to introduce new legislation today, which will ensure and encourage, investment in, and development of, renewable sources of energy, and which will expedite the installation of what ever renewable energy plant is currently available. They also need to lay definite plans for the phasing out of all fossil fuel burning, as alternatives become available, and to make every effort to make those alternatives available, as soon as possible. This would include fossil fuel burning in power stations, transport, and for domestic, and industrial, space heating, and in manafacturing.</P><P align=""justify"">In the area of transport, this would need measures for encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles, and positively discouraging the use of ICE cars, buses, and trucks. Ships trains, and planes will also need to cease using fossil fuels, and can use biofuels, or where practical be converted to use renewable energy directly. All trains can be electric, as many are already.</P><P align=""justify"">In the area of power generation, extensive use needs to be made of wind generators, both on-shore, and off-shore, solar panels to be installed wherever possible, and sufficient storage installed on the grid to buffer the mismatch between peak production, and peak demand. All other methods of energy harvesting, such as hydro, wave, tidal, and geothermal, need to be developed and utilised as soon as possible, and all the power produced by fossil fuels must be replaced by renewable energy sources at the earliest possible moment.</P><P align=""justify"">For space heating, renewable energy systems are already available, such as solar heat panels, and heat pumps operated by renewable electricity. Air conditioning can also be powered by renewable electricity. It is also possible to produce gas from bio-materials, from otherwise non-productive land. <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/09/rock-star-dale-vince-founder-of-ecotricity-interview/"">(See CleanTechnica Article)</A></P><P align=""justify"">In general, it must be made illegal to seek out any new sources of fossil fuels, or to drill any exploratory well, or mine, to test for the existence of fossil fuel deposits. All current fossil fuel production must cease, and wells and mines decommissioned, as soon as alternative energy sources become available. To put it more simply, all fossil fuels must be left in the ground as soon, and as much, as is practically possible.</P><P align=""justify"">We then need to look at energy efficiency so that the energy we are producing is not wasted. We also need to be conscious of the means by which <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide already in the atmosphere is absorbed. Plants, from microscopic phytoplankton in the ocean, to forest giants, are all absorbing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, and releasing oxygen, and without this process we could not live. We need to nurture and manage all of the land on the planet, and the oceans, to maximise the total of plant life, and plant health.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Methane – The Other Green-House Gas</H5><P align=""justify"">I have mentioned <mark>CO2</mark> so far, but methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas, and is released into the atmosphere from the following three sources-</P><OL><LI><P align=""justify"">Any rotting organic material, on farms, landfill sites, and occurring naturally in peat bogs, and the like.</P></LI><LI><P align=""justify"">Bovine animals reared for food, of which there are billions of individuals in the world today. They release methane through the mouth, in the process of digestion of plant material.</P></LI><LI><P align=""justify"">Oil and gas wells, from which methane constantly leaks, unless carefully managed.</P></LI></OL><P align=""justify"">It is simply not <mark>sustainable</mark> to continue consuming animals as food, and we all need to stop doing this for environmental, moral, and health reasons. If you must eat meat, eat birds or fishes, or when it comes in, the new “lab” meat. Methane from rotting material needs to be carefully managed, and can be used as a bio-fuel. Methane oxidizing bacteria can be employed to stop methane emissions, but these become decreasingly  effective from temperatures above 20 degrees Celcius. Methane from oil and gas wells will cease, once those wells are decommissioned, and in the meantime, need to be carefully managed. Methane from wells is a fossil fuel, and so should not be used.</P><P align=""justify"">As individuals we need to look at our own lifestyle, to reduce our use of energy and maximise our energy efficiency. This can be by large investments such as photovoltaic cells, wind turbines, electric vehicles, ground source heat pump installations, and home insulation, and also simple, low, or no, cost choices, such as changing what we eat, and how extravagant, or otherwise, we are in our use of energy. People also need to stop voting for irrational politicians like Trump, in the US, and The Tories, in the UK.</P><P align=""justify"">This ends Part I of this article: <A href=""https://evobsession.com/planet-earth-the…e-change-part-ii/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">in Part II</A>, coming soon, I will be talking about the contrast between what we need to do, as laid out above, but in more detail, and what we are actually doing, and the huge gap between what governments say, and what they are actually doing.</P><P align=""justify"">In the meantime you can follow me on <A href=""https://twitter.com/AndyMilesco"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Twitter</A>.</P> </DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Will <mark>BMW</mark>’s Solar-Wind Package Tap a New Target Car Market?
</H1><DIV class=""article-summary""><P>At upscale prices, <mark>BMW</mark> customers get green electric driving—but does that matter?</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""media-holder""><DIV class=""social-holder""><UL class=""social-networks ""><LI class=""comments""><SPAN class=""comment-count""><A href=""/articles/read/will-<mark>bmw</mark>s-solar-wind-package-tap-a-new-target-car-market#disqus_thread"" class=""link-mail"">2</A></SPAN></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><ARTICLE class=""article-body"" data-article-channel=""""><DIV class=""row custom add""><DIV class=""col-md-9 article-content""><P>
<mark>BMW</mark> is launching its all-electric ActiveE vehicle with a lease program for 700 dedicated customers. The pitch for the upscale car is that it's “100 percent electric and 100 percent <mark>BMW</mark>.”</P><P>
The rollout is basically “a <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/mixed-greens-ron-paul-furious-about-light-bulbs-<mark>bmw</mark>-creates-venture-fund-an/"">field trial</A>” of the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) marketplace for <mark>BMW</mark>, according to Green Mountain Energy Vice President Scott Martin. The ActiveE is not for sale. Only a two-year lease is available. <mark>BMW</mark> used a similar, 600-driver field test for its <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/test-drives-the-all-electric-mini-e-and-mercedess-f-cell-hydrogen-car/"">Mini E</A> electric car. <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/audi-mercedes-<mark>bmw</mark>-prep-electric-sports-cars-should-tesla-fisker-worry/"">Feedback</A> from that program informed preparations for the ActiveE rollout.</P><P>
This trial is aimed at what <mark>BMW</mark> calls “Electronauts” and will be limited to Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento, New York, Boston, and the state of Connecticut, where EVs are popular.</P><P>“<mark>BMW</mark> electric vehicle drivers,” Martin said, “are affluent, mostly urban individuals who put a high value on social responsibility and environmental friendliness. That’s according to <mark>BMW</mark>.” And, except perhaps for the term 'affluent,' Martin added, “that description lines up well with Green Mountain Energy’s customer.”</P><P>
To further appeal to <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/here-comes-the-revenge-of-the-electric-car/"">Electronauts’ enthusiasm</A> and concerns, Martin said, they will be given the opportunity, for a one-time fee of $48, to purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs) from Green Mountain Energy that will assure the electricity they are projected to use over the term of the two year lease will be offset by renewable energy.</P><P><A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/deregulation-doesnt-mean-healthy-competition/"">Green Mountain Energy</A> will obtain “regional wind” RECs from Western and Northeastern power systems. By purchasing from electricity distribution systems where the cars will be marketed, the Electronauts will, to the extent possible, be supporting local renewables.</P><P>
<mark>BMW</mark> is also offering its Electronauts the opportunity to install <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Solar-Installer-Insight-What-is-the-Best-PV-Panel-for-Your-Roof/"">residential rooftop solar</A> systems at a 35 percent discount. “This solar program, along with the new partnership with Green Mountain, demonstrates <mark>BMW</mark>’s truly holistic approach to <mark>sustainable</mark> mobility,” the company said.</P><P>
The renewables add-ons in the ActiveE marketing campaign, <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/embargo-<mark>bmw</mark>-picks-tendril-for-ev-charging-demo/""><mark>BMW</mark></A> said, eliminate <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/ethanol-or-electric-cars-the-debate-isnt-over-says-gm/"">critics’ claims</A> that EVs powered from a dirty grid still generate emissions. However, critics may argue that this is only partially true. An electric drivetrain’s increased efficiency can translate to fewer emissions from a coal-powered EV than from a comparable gasoline-powered vehicle. In any case, the Green Mountain Energy partnership raises another question.</P><P>
With record heat, droughts, and wildfires making <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/advertising-<mark>climate</mark>-change-a-study-of-green-ads-20052010/""><mark>climate change</mark></A> increasingly undeniable, Martin was asked, does offsetting matter? In answer, he pointed to markers of Green Mountain Energy’s success.</P><P>
In <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Ten-Years-in-Texas-Electric-Utility-Deregulation/"">the fifteen years Green Mountain Energy has worked</A> to reduce emissions growth, he said, it has funded some 50 renewable energy facilities and seen renewables’ cumulative share of U.S. electricity generation grow to 13 percent. “I can think of no greater proof of our standing and growth potential,” Martin said, “than the fact that NRG Energy bought us for $350 million.” Other markers of success, he added, include its expanding customer base and banner name clients like the Empire State Building and the NFL's Super Bowl.</P><P>
Because Green Mountain is now owned by NRG, Martin explained, numbers that show its customer base and revenues are growing are unavailable. Graphs of “<mark>CO2</mark> avoided” and “renewable energy served” in Green Mountain’s sustainability report may substantiate Martin’s claims.</P><P>
But the numbers aren’t the entire story, said Attorney Jerry Bloom, the Winston &amp; Strawn, LLC Energy Practice Chair. “The market is telling us that the people who are marketing, and here it is <mark>BMW</mark>, believe there is such <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/clean-tech-needs-to-shift-focus-to-the-consumer/"">a thirst and demand from consumers</A> for green products that it is valuable for them to be able to certify the product is green.”</P><P>
This demand, Bloom said, “is very grassroots, but at the same time is way at the top, with companies like <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/what-is-the-back-story-on-googles-renewables-play/"">Google</A> and Wal-Mart and Proctor and Gamble and Dow Chemical. These companies believe that for future growth, for strictly commercial value, they need to be able to certify they are green.”</P><P>
The new paradigm, Bloom explained, is “the commercial private sector paradigm that says, irrespective of what the government may or may not require, green in itself has a perceived value. And people are chasing that -- and they’re chasing it hard.”</P><P>
There are still a lot of the unanswered questions, he acknowledged. “What’s the measurement of green? When do you get to claim you’re green? What do you get to say in advertisements? That’s the next step. But the first premise is to say there is a value. <mark>BMW</mark> obviously believes that.”</P><P><A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/walmart-and-cdp-reaching-the-tipping-point/"">Wal-Mart now has a sustainability index</A>, Bloom said. “If you are Proctor &amp; Gamble, who makes more sales to Wal-Mart on a wholesale level than all their other sales put together, and you believe you have to do well on the sustainability index to maintain your sales to Wal-Mart, you are trying to figure out how to become greener. That’s the private sector talking. That’s the commercial market giving value to being green.”</P><P>
Another example, Bloom added, “is <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/green-light/post/rgy-efficiency-winning-global-green-stimulus-race-says-hsbc/"">HBSC</A>, a huge British bank. It now has a sustainability index for making commercial loans, strictly because of concerns about <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/sustainability-is-really-risk-management/"">potential liability and risk</A>. Companies that want to borrow money may have to bring down their <mark>carbon</mark> footprint to borrow money from HSBC.”</P><P>
A huge number of companies, and <mark>BMW</mark> is a perfect example, Bloom noted, “are saying, ‘We are only going to deal with green companies.’ How you quantify how big the demand is, I don’t know yet. What I do know is that this market is real.”</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></UL></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

          This article is part of the <SPAN class=""related-item"">World Economic Forum Annual Meeting</SPAN></A></DIV><DIV class=""article-body""><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>For anyone concerned about disruptive <mark>climate change</mark>, 2016 was a tumultuous year. On 4 November, the <A href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/09/what-is-the-paris-agreement-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">Paris <mark>climate change</mark> agreement</A> went into force; three days later, Donald Trump, who has called <mark>climate change</mark> a <A href=""https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en"">hoax</A> “created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive” was elected President of the United States.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>Even before election day, there were troubling signs on the horizon. Scientifically, new data showed that two of the most dangerous impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>, <A href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/09/greenland-s-ice-sheets-are-disappearing-faster-than-predicted-here-s-why-you-should-care"">ice-melt</A> and record <A href=""https://www2.ucar.edu/atmosnews/news/1036/record-high-temperatures-far-outpace-record-lows-across-us"">high temperatures</A>, were accelerating. Politically, conservatives in Washington, DC were already mobilizing to <A href=""https://cei.org/content/paris-<mark>climate</mark>-agreement-treaty-requiring-senate-review?gclid=CjwKEAiA17LDBRDElqOGq8vR7m8SJAA1AC0__jNJOAcaaE761vv8pA9xc-iBRGMvh9k2RBF607KA4xoCNGzw_wcB"">block</A> the Paris accord, just as they blocked US participation in the Kyoto protocol. </P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>Now the President-elect proposes to appoint the CEO of Exxon-Mobil, Rex Tillerson, whose company has <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/business/global/exxon-and-rosneft-partner-in-russian-oil-deal.html"">committed to developing</A> the world’s largest untapped oil reserves - in the Russian Arctic - to lead the US State Department.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>Scientists have <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/analysis-only-five-years-left-before-one-point-five-c-budget-is-blown"">little doubt</A> that development and combustion of these reserves will push global atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations above the level of dangerous <mark>climate</mark> disruption. As one recent scientific <A href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v517/n7533/abs/nature14016.html"">paper</A> puts it: “development of resources in the Arctic … [is] incommensurate with efforts to limit average global warming to 2°C.” </P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>But the fact is, a number of oil and gas companies have been gearing up to drill in the Arctic for many years and the Paris Agreement doesn’t change that. In fact, it left each country to decide for itself what to do and how to do it. So while American leadership would be desirable, it is not a prerequisite for the rest of us to proceed.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>There is an enormous amount that the business community can do, because at root the solution to <mark>climate change</mark> is technological. Anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> is primarily caused by burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests. Therefore, it will be prevented primarily by switching the sources of our energy and greening our supply chains. Government policies can support and accelerate these transitions, but they are not required.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>According to <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-14/solar-and-wind-just-did-the-unthinkable"">Bloomberg</A>, solar power is now the <A href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/1/1/1615247/-Solar-now-cheapest-new-form-of-energy-in-nearly-60-countries"">cheapest</A> form of energy in many countries, including in nearly 60 low-income ones. In emerging markets, solar and wind are outcompeting oil, gas and coal, despite very low <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-14/solar-and-wind-just-did-the-unthinkable"">prices</A> for those commodities. Some of this is driven by government policy, particularly investment by the Chinese government in renewable energy infrastructure, but increasingly renewable energy is both preferable and profitable. </P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>Meanwhile, at Unilever, <A href=""https://www.unilever.com/news/speeches/Paul-Polman-interview-with-Business-Green.html"">CEO Paul Polman</A> is demonstrating that businesses can support <mark>sustainable</mark> development while serving both their customers and their shareholders. Unilever has aligned their corporate strategy with the United Nations Millennium Development goals, noting that the scale of the activities of large corporations enables them to have real impact.</P></DIV><H2 class=""st__content-block st__content-block--heading""><B>Overcoming obstacles </B></H2><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>However, private-sector leadership on <mark>climate</mark> will require us to overcome some conceptual obstacles. </P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>One conceptual obstacle is that “socially responsible” is not fiscally responsible. In diverse sectors, companies around the globe have proved that isn't true. Just look at <mark>BMW</mark>. According to a recent <A href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathryndill/2016/01/22/the-worlds-most-<mark>sustainable</mark>-companies-2016/#4a7f3ef4965f"">report</A> in Forbes, <mark>BMW</mark> was the world’s most <mark>sustainable</mark> company in 2016, while enjoying low employee turnover, taking a responsible approach to investment, maintaining a low ratio of CEO-to-average worker pay, and, yes, making large profits by making great cars.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>That said, many socially responsible policies don't address <mark>carbon</mark> - indeed, <mark>BMW</mark> lags badly on that point. Addressing <mark>climate</mark> in terms of both products and policies - including the application of corporate prestige and influence to advance sound <mark>climate policy</mark> - should be an essential part of any programme of social responsibility. </P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>A second is the free-rider problem. For a long time, many argued that it would be ineffective, perhaps even foolish, to act alone on <mark>climate</mark>: <mark>climate change</mark> was a global problem that needed a global solution. Going forward, Russia or the US could become drains on the world economy if they continue to promote damaging fossil fuel development, and already some political <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/us/politics/trump-<mark>climate</mark>-change.html?_r=0"">leaders</A> have <A href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/donald-trump-us-<mark>carbon</mark>-tax-nicolas-sarkozy-global-warming-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-a7418301.html"">suggested</A> that a <mark>carbon</mark> tax might have to be imposed on US imports. But the fact is: as renewable energy technology becomes increasingly profitable, the companies and countries that lead its development will see their influence and power increase. </P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>A third is the idea that efficiency and design are for sissies. Most near-term population growth is likely to be in urban areas, which offers tremendous opportunities not just for energy efficiency but also for creative solutions that support a high quality of life, both at home and in the workplace. The <A href=""http://www.bullittcenter.org/"">Bullitt Center</A> in Seattle is a case in point: it doesn’t just use less energy, it <I>produces</I> energy. </P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>The fourth is the hobgloblin of “energy poverty”. Of course poor people need energy, but that does not mean they need fossil fuels. To the contrary: the work of Social Entrepreneur <A href=""http://www.schwabfound.org/content/harish-hande"">Harish Hande</A>, Global Shaper <A href=""https://www.globalshapers.org/shapers/jaideep-bansal"">Jaideep Bansal</A>, and others like them demonstrates that renewable power can meet the needs of poor communities quickly and efficiently.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>Just as many rural communities leapfrogged land-lines to adopt mobile telephones, so these communities are <A>leapfrogging</A> 20th Century style land-line electricity into 21st Century distributed solutions. Large, smart integrated grids may be a good choice for the US and Europe, but highly distributed energy may well solve energy poverty, particularly when coupled to the rapid advances in <A href=""https://electrek.co/2016/07/27/tesla-powerwall-6-months-customer-review/"">local</A> energy storage that are underway. After all, why make poor people wait for a big expensive grid run on fossil fuels when they can have the energy they need right now? Consider <A href=""https://www.nokero.com/our-impact-a/256.htm"">Nokero</A>, which makes solar lights designed to replace costly and dangerous kerosene lanterns. The Indian woman who buys one now doesn’t have to wait for a grid to reach her village. </P></DIV><H2 class=""st__content-block st__content-block--heading""><B>Looking to the future</B></H2><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>The future is in clean, green energy. The question is whether we will get there before the world suffers serious <mark>climate</mark> disruption and what role we as a community will play. We should continue to push for appropriate policy, because history shows that government policy can be a powerful driver of research, development, and <mark>innovation</mark>, and because appropriate policies will be essential to future cities. We should work with the <A href=""https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/24288"">World Bank</A> and <A href=""http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2015/NEW070215A.htm"">International Monetary Fund</A> to phase out perverse <A href=""https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15105.pdf"">subsidies</A> for fossil fuels, and support <mark>carbon</mark> <A href=""https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/25160"">pricing</A> so that the external costs of fossil fuels are properly accounted, and oppose expanded fossil fuel infrastructure. The World Economic Forum should seek to increase the visibility of <A href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/11/open-letter-from-ceos-to-world-leaders-urging-<mark>climate</mark>-action/"">The Alliance of CEO <mark>Climate</mark> Leaders</A> and The Friends of <mark>Climate</mark> Action, and perhaps consider a Partnering Against <mark>Climate Change</mark> Initiative (PACCI) akin to the recently formed Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI).</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>And those of us in leadership positions - in manufacturing, finance, pension funds, education, and philanthropy - should help to steer our institutions away from investment in fossil fuels and towards investment in clean and healthy energy, as well as away from trade organizations that continue to oppose sensible <mark>climate</mark> and energy <mark>innovation</mark> policies. </P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>The business community has a historic opportunity to lead on <mark>climate change</mark> in 2017, and beyond.
