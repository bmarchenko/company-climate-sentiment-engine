There is also a need for near future weather scenarios and anticipation of their impacts in the water cycle together with risk management strategies. BINGO will provide demand-driven solutions for a number of specific <mark>climate</mark>-related challenges in particular for highly vulnerable water resources of strategic importance. Water managers and other stakeholders will then be provided with information on specific <mark>climate</mark> scenarios at the space/time resolution fitting their needs, enabling them to act at various geographical levels (local, regional and European). BINGO aims at reducing the uncertainty of <mark>climate</mark> predictions and developing response strategies to help society manage that uncertainty. An innovative approach consists of enrolling end-users from the start, identifying specific vulnerabilities, needs and concerns about future <mark>climate</mark>. BINGO is built around 7 research sites in Northern and Southern Europe, covering a representative range of climatic conditions as well as combinations of water systems and water pressures. They illustrate a variety of water cycles at local/regional scales in Europe over various timescales, as well as common problems, including floods and droughts; water quality pressured by CSO, agriculture and competing demands for water (urban/tourism; agriculture/food security; hydropower). To guarantee sound management strategies for future weather challenges, BINGO will develop and validate all solutions built by strong dynamic interaction of researchers with end-users and decision makers throughout the project. By creating such knowledge alliances, water managers and other stakeholders can share awareness of <mark>climate</mark> challenges, thus increasing the possibilities of collaboration in order to manage and better cope with future <mark>climate</mark> challenges.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""hiddenwrapper""><UL id=""information-item-tabs"" class=""nav nav-tabs margin-top-20 hidPdf"" role=""tablist""><LI><A href=""#results"" aria-controls=""results"" role=""tab"" data-toggle=""tab"">Results</A></LI></UL><DIV class=""relatedContent""><DIV class=""tab-content""><DIV role=""tabpanel"" class=""tab-pane active"" id=""relatedInfo""><DIV class=""relatedInfo""><DIV class=""ReportSummary"" id=""ReportSummary""><DIV class=""label""><H3 class=""title"">Report Summaries</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

These are just two of the headlines that appeared in January. Satellite images confirm that the water situation in the region is serious. Drought expert <A href=""https://www.uu.nl/staff/NWanders"">dr Niko Wanders</A> blames this on the lack of rain caused by the strong El Niño of recent years. The situation has been further exacerbated by <mark>climate change</mark> and the increased demand for water in the region. ​</P><P>The present drought in Cape Town has been caused by extremely poor rainfall in recent months, with the result that the water supplies are under enormous pressure. It is feared that, unless it rains very soon, the drinking water supply in Cape town will be seriously threatened. Of course, rain in itself will not immediately solve the problem, as the water supplies have shrunk to such an extent that it will take a long time for them to be replenished.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""content-block content-block-beeld""><DIV class=""content-block-inner""><DIV class=""caption"">Figure 1: Satellite image of the reservoirs surrounding Cape Town in the month of January for the last four years.

He shows that the amount of available water in the region around Cape Town is indeed dependent on El Niño (Figure 2). Wanders: “The stronger the El Niño signal, the less water is available in the region. This is first manifest in the form of less rain, soon followed by lower discharges in the rivers. These lower discharges also have a direct influence on water storage levels in the reservoirs. If there is a continuous shortage of water feeding the reservoirs, this will inevitably lead to water shortages and thus drought. This drought can have terrible consequences, as Cape Town is now experiencing.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""content-block content-block-beeld""><DIV class=""content-block-inner""><DIV class=""caption"">Figure 2: Correlation between the El Niño signal and discharge anomalies.

Measures such as new reservoirs or better irrigation systems could help to mitigate the water scarcity, thinks Wanders.</P><H3>Human influence</H3><P>Human influence on drought is also an increasingly important factor, and this present drought is no exception. Across the continent of Africa, more and more water is being used for irrigation, and this puts increasing pressure on the limited water available. During times of drought this becomes increasingly evident, and it also means that existing shortages become worse. This is true in other parts of the world besides Africa, so <mark>sustainable</mark> water consumption is one of the most important factors if we want to overcome drought in the future. We need to invest in <mark>sustainable</mark> measures to ensure that water is not lost or too polluted for use as drinking water.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""content-block content-block-beeld""><DIV class=""content-block-inner""><DIV class=""caption"">Figure 3: Changes in duration and intensity of drought in the 21st century.

Much of it is arid or semi-arid and the whole country is subject to droughts and floods. Even small variations in rainfall or temperatures would exacerbate this already stressed environment. Most South African crops are grown in areas that are only just climatically suitable and with limited water supplies.</P><P>But that <mark>climate</mark> is set to change for the worse because of rising global emissions of greenhouse gases. Indeed, there are already ominous signs of change – dry seasons are becoming longer and wet seasons starting later. Rainfall is reported to be becoming even more variable, with rain coming in more concentrated, violent bursts.</P><P>As the <mark>climate change</mark>s, it is South Africa’s poor, the majority of the population, who will be the hardest hit.  <mark>Climate change</mark> worsens existing vulnerabilities and adds to the pressures on the environment and natural resources on which so many South Africans directly rely. <mark>Climate change</mark> could increase the prevalence and distribution of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever and water-borne diseases such as cholera and dysentery. Such things mean that people living with HIV/AIDS in particular would experience increased risks.</P><P>South Africa has been playing an influential role as a developing country in international <mark>climate change</mark> negotiations even though it is not yet obliged to make commitments to reduce emissions. But South Africa is also part of the problem – the largest emitter of green house gases on the African continent and home to the world’s biggest single emitter of <mark>CO2</mark> (<A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasol"">Sasol</A>‘s Secunda plant, which converts coal to diesel and other fuels).</P><P>South Africa is faced with a difficult challenge in trying to juggle three imperatives – development (conventionally based on fossil fuels), poverty eradication and <mark>climate change</mark>. On the one hand, the country has to fast track provision of adequate transport, power, communication networks, water, sanitation and other infrastructure services. Much of this development implies that South Africa’s GHG emissions will increase. The provision of these services is essential to improving people’s well being and to reducing poverty.</P><P>On the other hand, conventional development as carried out in South Africa (like many other countries) has not focused on reducing poverty, will not reduce it by itself, and may sometimes exacerbate poverty and ill-health. And now South Africa also has to respond to the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> by reducing emissions and helping poor people adapt to the changing <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>Energy production is a particular concern. South Africa’s dependency on coal-fired power stations has already resulted in a yearly per capita emission rate of about 10 tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, 43 percent higher than the global average.  But despite extremely high per capita energy use, 30% of South African citizens do not have access to electricity.</P><P>So what needs to happen? To provide cleaner energy to all citizens equitably and effectively, South Africa needs to agree:</P><P>1. A moratorium on building further coal-fired plants
2. An immediate moratorium on any new coal-to-liquid plants.
3. The Treasury should institute its fossil fuel levy with immediate effect, revenue from this to be ring-fenced for Free Basic Electricity.
4. A staggered implementation of <mark>carbon</mark> taxation.
5. The provision of 1 million solar water heaters by 2020.
6. 15% of all electricity to come from renewable energy by 2020, and 50% by 2050.
7. Make energy efficiency in Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) housing a mandatory measure by 2015.
8. Invest in an efficient public transport system.
9. Promote gardening in urban and peri-urban areas and around homesteads.
10. Increase public awareness and promote behavioural change among consumers.</P><P>A year and a half ago, an official from the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT) stood up before a group of environmentalists and NGO representatives and pleaded, <EM>“Where is the environmental movement? Where are the placards? We can’t change things without the pressure of citizens.” </EM>At the end of 2009, the governments of the world will meet to decide our collective fate at the UN <mark>climate change</mark> conference at Copenhagen; they have this one chance. Perhaps we should remind them just exactly who they are working for.’</P><P><EM>Update: Nearly ten years later (2018), this post still regularly appears as one of the most-read on FP2P – could someone tell me who is recommending it?</EM></P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

When times were good and the commodity super-cycle raised prices to all-time highs from 2002-11, the natural resources boom could have been channelled into benefits for the citizenry, perhaps through a sovereign wealth fund or nationalized mines.</P><P>But pro-corporate policy prevailed and instead of circulating the wealth, most major mining houses are headquartered overseas and export their profits. The continent suffered a net negative outflow of wealth (‘adjusted net saving’), according to even the pro-extraction-and-export World Bank. Depletion of so-called ‘natural capital’ (i.e. ripping minerals from the soil) left the continent’s producers poorer, especially during the 2000s boom that was misnamed ‘Africa Rising’.</P><P>In the resource-cursed country I know best, South Africa, the depletion of this natural capital in a typical year outweighs the additions of ‘produced capital’ and ‘human capital’, the Bank admits, leaving our compatriots an average US$245 poorer each (in this expanded measure) than they started the year. Yet the economic irrationality of mining under these circumstances goes unmentioned, because of overwhelming business babble about ‘job creation,’‘export earnings’, ‘new downstream and upstream businesses,’‘infrastructure to access remote mining areas’, and ‘economic development.’</P><P>Those days are now over. The justifications fall apart on closer examination, especially given how vulnerable South Africa is to the whimsical world economy and to the terrible pressure of men like Business Day editor Peter Bruce, local capital’s loudest voice. He insisted in 2012, i.e. after minerals prices started to crash, that the government must help corporations “mine more and faster and ship what we mine cheaper and faster.” The country’s two biggest infrastructure projects, estimated to cost US$25 billion each, will do exactly that: more coal stripped from eastern South Africa and shipped through Richards Bay (one of the world’s largest coal export sites), plus a port-petrochemical expansion in Durban.</P><P>Critics of ‘extractivism’– i.e., of the mindless, self-destructive route Bruce advocates – usually point out the vast political, social and ecological costs of the industry, but the implications of the commodity price crash should be foremost in mind.</P><P>To illustrate, last week marked the third anniversary of the worst post-apartheid violence by state against society: 34 striking Lonmin platinum mineworkers killed in two locations at Marikana two hours west of Johannesburg on <SPAN id=""OBJ_PREFIX_DWT1327_com_zimbra_date""><SPAN id=""OBJ_PREFIX_DWT1341_com_zimbra_date"">August 16</SPAN></SPAN>, 2012.

Not far from Marikana, in Brits, Glencore announced one of its main platinum mines would close, and one of its main coal mines was closed so hurriedly that the state mining minister felt compelled to suspend the parent firm’s license. (Glencore is the new name of the firm that US tax fugitive Mark Rich used to bust United Nations oil sanctions to supply apartheid South Africa.) Two months ago Glencore sold its stake in the world’s third main platinum mine, Lonmin.</P><P>Lonmin was labeled ‘the unacceptable face of capitalism’ by British Prime Minister Edwin Heath (a conservative) in 1973 because of the way that Tiny Rowland looted Africa and bribed its leaders. On <SPAN id=""OBJ_PREFIX_DWT1336_com_zimbra_date""><SPAN id=""OBJ_PREFIX_DWT1350_com_zimbra_date"">July 24</SPAN></SPAN> Lonmin also announced 6000 job cuts as several mineshaft closures, as its share price hit a record low, having lost 70 percent over the past year. Since May alone, the platinum price has fallen 14 percent.</P><P>The shares of the main gold firms listed on the Joburg Stock Exchange have fallen 73 percent from a 2002 peak.</P><P>Next are the downstream mineral smelters and metal works, now crashing just as fast as the miners. The Arcellor Mittal iron and steel firm is owned by an Indian but based in tax haven Luxemburg, and is <SPAN id=""OBJ_PREFIX_DWT1337_com_zimbra_date""><SPAN id=""OBJ_PREFIX_DWT1351_com_zimbra_date"">today</SPAN></SPAN> worth just 5 percent of its 2008 stock market valuation. According to the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), “Arcelor Mittal is considering the closure of their plant in Vereeniging; and other major companies such as Evraz Highveld Steel in Mpumalanga and Scaw Metals Group are intending to retrench thousands of workers.” Complained metalworker leader Irvin Jim, “The country’s political alliance with China is becoming problematic for our economy and workers in particular. The dumping of steel by the Chinese in our country is destroying jobs, so we need government’s intervention” in the form of protective tariffs.</P><P>Emergency measures are going to be needed, and if that means protectionism to defend the major steel corporations against China’s boomeranging exports of base metals, a fair deal would involve more power for workers at the point of production in exchange. It appears that Employee Share Ownership gimmicks on offer. However, what with the ruling party’s hatred of the metalworkers union – Africa’s largest – because of its recent breakaway left project, a genuine pro-worker arrangement is unlikely. So jobs will be lost permanently at a time the unemployment rate exceeds 35 percent.</P><P>In this extremely difficult period, it also makes sense for critics of mining and smelting to wage a long-haul battle for an economy not subject to world market whims and multinational corporate exploitation. A more visionary approach is required, one piece of which should be a genuine full-cost accounting of mining aimed at fusing the interests of mineworkers, communities (and local small businesses), environmentalists and democrats.</P><P>This would show that since mining is a net drain on the economy, state resources should instead be allocated to a full employment programme aiming to meet basic needs. One place to start is eliminating the huge subsidies to high-<mark>carbon</mark> smelting and mining, such as billions of dollars in ultra-cheap electricity that go to the world’s largest mining company, BHP Billiton, and others in the Energy Intensive Users Group. These remain unjustifiable at a time of electricity shortages (and blackouts) and concern over South Africa’s extremely high <mark>climate change</mark> liability.</P><P>One countervailing campaign, ‘<SPAN id=""OBJ_PREFIX_DWT1338_com_zimbra_url""><SPAN id=""OBJ_PREFIX_DWT1352_com_zimbra_url""><A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>jobs.org.za/"" target=""_blank"">Million <mark>Climate</mark> Jobs’</A></SPAN></SPAN>, suggests that smelting jobs be converted to welding a new generation of wind and tidal turbines, and home-based solar installations. As for policy, a small step in a more <mark>sustainable</mark> direction was taken in 2012 when South Africa and nine other African countries endorsed the Gaborone Declaration. Because of “the limitations that GDP has as a measure of well-being and <mark>sustainable</mark> growth,” the Declaration commits to “integrating the value of natural capital into national accounting and corporate planning,” which if actually done would immediately negate the mining industry’s economic arguments.</P><P>Furthermore, the Declaration argues, signatories should be “transitioning agriculture, extractive industries, fisheries and other natural capital uses to practices that promote <mark>sustainable</mark> employment, food security, <mark>sustainable</mark> energy and the protection of natural capital.” Such a transition is vital for local economic protection and global <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation.</P><P>Needless to say, a government under the thumb of men like Ramaphosa won’t take seriously this pledge, which was signed by the weak Environment Minister, Edna Molewa. The capture of the new democratic rulers of South Africa by mining did not lead to better wealth distribution, unlike in Venezuela after the 2002 battle over PDVSA oil. But it has ensured class-struggle showdowns like Marikana, three years ago, will move now from the point of production to economy policy contestation.</P><P><EM>Patrick Bond is a political economist at Wits University in Johannesburg and also directs the Centre for Civil Society at the University of KwaZulu-Natal.</EM></P></DIV><DIV class=""tagBarNews""><H4>Tags</H4></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

While most are aware of the threats, she finds they might not be adapting fast enough.</STRONG></P><P>SOUTH African cities are grappling with less water, more flooding, runaway fires and sizzling temperatures due to <mark>climate change</mark>. Official scenarios for the future predict these impacts will be felt most acutely in cities, where extra investment is needed to prepare for increasing disruption. </P><P>Decisions about investment in urban infrastructure, buildings and land use taken now will have huge implications for development outcomes in the future. They could prove critical in preventing cities from being locked into un<mark>sustainable</mark> development pathways that will expose them to increasingly intense and frequent urban shocks and stresses. </P><P>Investing in the right decisions for the future takes up resources, both in management and capital. To assess if South African cities are preparing for the worst, ClimaTracker scrutinised published adaptation data sets and sent questionnaires to eight municipalities. </P><BLOCKQUOTE><EM>“<mark>Climate change</mark> will have significant impacts on the availability of water in our city.”</EM></BLOCKQUOTE><DIV class=""block text-block""><P>All the municipalities surveyed indicated that creating resilience to the threats of <mark>climate change</mark> should be a priority. Many of them said increasing collaboration between different departments is key to ensuring that the correct policies are drawn up and implemented. </P><P>Data compiled for internal <mark>climate change</mark> reports and for external compliance monitoring bodies indicates city authorities are well aware of the threats of <mark>climate change</mark>, but putting that knowledge into action by mainstreaming resilience projects, allocating funds and accessing financing remain challenges. </P><P><STRONG>Drought: Cape Town </STRONG></P><P><EM>Cape Town is dealing with the dual challenges of unprecedented drought and increased water demand due to population growth, urbanisation and economic development.</EM></P><P>The city, which is home to around 3.7 million people, also identifies heatwaves and flooding as <mark>climate</mark> risks. </P><P>“People are moving out of villages and into cities at a pace unprecedented in history,” says Michael Berkowitz, president of the 100 Resilient Cities network, which is helping cities around the world to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>Cape Town has set up a working group comprised of representatives from relevant city departments to facilitate collaboration on <mark>climate</mark> projects at administrative level. Their decisions feed into a dedicated council committee on <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>The city has appointed a chief resilience officer, Craig Kesson, and has included a <mark>climate</mark> adaptation response in its 2017-2022 industrial development plan. </P><P>Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille says the city is reviewing its 30-year water plan. “<mark>Climate change</mark> will have significant impacts on the availability of water in our city and the current drought provides us with the perfect opportunity to focus our minds on the appropriate responses.”</P><P>Previously <mark>climate change</mark> issues fell under a more general environmental policy, but because of their growing importance they require a more dedicated approach, De Lille says. </P><P>A water-saving programme targets both technical and behavioural changes. This includes public awareness campaigns about water use efficiency, water tariffs designed to encourage water savings, the promotion of the use of recycled water for irrigation, as well as a range of technical interventions to minimise water losses. </P><BLOCKQUOTE><EM>“People are moving out of villages and into cities at a pace unprecedented in history”</EM></BLOCKQUOTE><DIV class=""block text-block""><P>Particularly vital and socially inclusive elements include offering free plumbing repairs for low-income households and training “community plumbers”. More than 4 000 households have been visited for leak detections and repairs, and 258km of water pipes have been replaced to reduce leaks. </P><P>The city says the programme has been a success, as water demand has grown at an average of 1.78% compared to an average growth of more than 4% before implementation. </P><P>While Cape Town’s coastline is one of the city’s most important assets, it is also a source of risk due to rising sea levels and storms. City adaptation measures include a “coastal set-back line”, which ensures that development does not encroach on the coastal biodiversity and now protects more than 240km of coastline. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""block heading-block""><DIV class=""block text-block""><P><STRONG>Rising seas - Ethekwini</STRONG></P><P><EM>Ethekwini municipality, home to South Africa’s third largest city, Durban, is dealing with coastal erosion, rising sea levels and extreme storms.</EM></P><P>Durban’s average annual temperature increase is expected to be between 1.5°C and 2.5°C by 2065, with the outer west areas predicted to experience increases in short duration rainfall which may lead to flooding. Heat waves are also expected to increase. </P><P>The city has a chief resilience officer, Dr Debra Roberts, whose main goal is to maintain coastal ecological infrastructure as a buffer against sea level rises and coastal storms. </P><P>Durban’s coastal built environment is protected where appropriate, and further development is discouraged in high risk areas.</P><DIV class=""block heading-block""><DIV class=""block text-block""><P><STRONG>Storms and flooding – Ekurhuleni</STRONG></P><P><EM>In Gauteng the Ekurhuleni municipality is dealing with heat waves, urban flooding and severe storms.</EM></P><P>City planner Freddie Aucamp says high-risk flooding areas have been identified and community awareness campaigns have been launched. </P><P>A green infrastructure sustainability guideline has been drawn up to improve storm water management.

</TIME></P><DIV id=""article_body""><P class=""intro"">Earlier this week, the Vaal Environmental Justice Alliance formally released the long-sought Environmental Master Plan for the Vanderbijlpark Steel Works owned by international steel giant ArcelorMittal (AMSA). AMSA only handed over this Master Plan, a series of expert reports on the environmental and health impacts of the steel works compiled in 2003, in December 2014, after being ordered to do so by the Supreme Court of Appeal.</P><DIV class=""field-item even"" property=""content:encoded""><H2>The birth of Steel Valley</H2><P>Dr Victor Munnik, researcher at the University of the Witwatersrand who has studied Steel Valley for many years, describes how the Vanderbijlpark Steel Works was built in the 1950s by the apartheid parastatal Iscor as part of a government initiative to establish industry on the Vaal coalfields. For most of its existence, the Steel Valley community living to the west of the Steel Works was a racially segmented society, with white smallholders as owners, retaining one or two black families as farmworkers or servants on each holding. This started changing by 1990, when black South Africans could buy land in “white areas”, and established themselves as smallholders in the area.</P><P>For many decades, the Steel Valley community argued that the Steel Works was polluting air, soil and groundwater in the area. Iscor denied that it was responsible for the <mark>pollution</mark> in Vanderbijlpark.</P><P>By 2002, the entire community of nearly 600 smallholdings, their houses, outbuildings and shops had disappeared. Civil damages claims brought against Iscor floundered as the steelmaker bought up many of the small farms. The area had been cordoned off with electric fences. Most of the population had been dispersed into neighbouring towns and townships.</P><P>However, Steel Valley residents would not go quietly: some of the ex-residents continued their battle. In his PhD thesis on Steel Valley, Dr Munnik describes how a “toxic tour” for overseas dignitaries, in which the steel factory was a “highlight”, as well as public protests during the World Summit on <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development in 2002, brought the Steel Valley history to the attention of the world. Ex-residents continued to take part in consultation processes made available under environmental legislation in the new South Africa. They formed a regional (Vaal Triangle) alliance with other fenceline and impacted communities. They achieved the integration of Steel Valley survivors into first a national environmental justice movement and then a global network of communities affected by AMSA’s <mark>pollution</mark>, which aims to hold AMSA accountable for its <mark>pollution</mark> worldwide. <SUP id=""fnref:1""><A href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</A></SUP></P><H2>The long-sought Master Plan</H2><P>For many years, the challenges of gathering persuasive evidence of <mark>pollution</mark> by AMSA and its predecessors, particularly in the face of its denial of any responsibility for <mark>pollution</mark>, has complicated efforts to hold the owners of the steel plant accountable.</P><P>In the early 2000s, under pressure from Steel Valley residents and regulators (particularly in view of the Constitution and its recognition of environmental rights, and new environmental legislation passed in the late 1990s) the company commissioned a “holistic integrated environmental Master Plan for the Iscor Vanderbijlpark Steel (IVS) Works, whereby all disciplines would be thoroughly researched, and all available historic information used and combined with the aim of providing an integrated environmental management plan for the Works”. <SUP id=""fnref:2""><A href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</A></SUP></P><P>The Master Plan, completed in 2003, is a comprehensive strategy document that contains the results of specialist environmental tests for <mark>pollution</mark> levels at Vanderbijlpark, as well as recommendations for AMSA to address this <mark>pollution</mark> and rehabilitate its sites over a 20-year period. The Master Plan consists of more than 7,000 pages of 22 specialist investigations covering the following topics: toxicology, solid waste, sediments, leachates, soils, air quality, ground water, process water system, geotechnical, geology, environmental monitoring, land capability, terrestrial eco-systems, surface water, aquatic eco-systems, consultation process, noise, archaeology, visual aspects, land use and socio-economics.</P><P>But despite undertakings by Iscor to share the Master Plan with local communities, in 2003 they were only given a summary report of the Master Plan. This summary failed to answer their questions, and left the communities frustrated and angry. It also identified that various significant unacceptable environmental and human health risks existed at the site.</P><H2>Compliance inspections</H2><P>In November 2008, Environmental Management Inspectors (Green Scorpions) undertook a compliance inspection at the Vanderbijlpark Steel Works. <SUP id=""fnref:3""><A href=""#fn:3"" rel=""footnote"">3</A></SUP> Not surprisingly, that inspection found a long list of violations with environmental and water laws, including a lack of permits, failure to comply with permits and uncontrolled atmospheric emissions (air <mark>pollution</mark>). A follow-up inspection in August 2010 found that AMSA continued to operate without certain permits and in violation of existing permits. In 2013, authorities instructed AMSA to close certain facilities for violating requirements to limit air <mark>pollution</mark>.</P><P>Despite the persistent allegations of water <mark>pollution</mark> at the site, and despite the findings of the Green Scorpions inspections in 2008 and 2010 in relation to violation of water laws, we have no evidence of any administrative or criminal enforcement action taken against AMSA or its predecessors by the Department of Water &amp; Sanitation or its predecessors.</P><H2>Court victory for the Vaal Environmental Justice Alliance</H2><P>In 2011, with support from the then newly established Centre for Environmental Rights (CER), community-based organisation the Vaal Environmental Justice Alliance (VEJA) submitted a request in terms of the Promotion of Access to Information Act for the Master Plan for the Vanderbijlpark Steel Works. These documents were finally released to VEJA in December 2014, after the Supreme Court of Appeal upheld VEJA’s case, and – in a strident judgement - <A href=""http://groundup.org.za/article/vaal-environmental-justice-alliance-claim-court-victory_2496"">ordered AMSA to release the Master Plan and pay VEJA’s legal costs</A>. <SUP id=""fnref:4""><A href=""#fn:4"" rel=""footnote"">4</A></SUP></P><H2>What did AMSA know in 2003?</H2><P>The Integration Report of January 2003 (which forms part of the Master Plan) makes clear that, at the time that the Master Plan was prepared, there was already substantial <mark>pollution</mark> at the Vanderbijlpark plant, particularly groundwater and soil contamination by a range of contaminants that include heavy metals. <SUP id=""fnref:5""><A href=""#fn:5"" rel=""footnote"">5</A></SUP> It also recorded “potentially unacceptable impact” on the surface water of the Rietkuilspruit via the Rietspruit canal”. <SUP id=""fnref:6""><A href=""#fn:6"" rel=""footnote"">6</A></SUP></P><P>The report showed a “potentially unacceptable” risk to the environment and human health as these contaminants move through groundwater, with potential exposure through affected drinking water. <SUP id=""fnref:7""><A href=""#fn:7"" rel=""footnote"">7</A></SUP> The Report also found that the risks to human health and the environment were “generally unacceptable” in the area between the contaminated areas on site and the western perimeter of the plant, and “for a distance beyond the perimeter”. <SUP id=""fnref:8""><A href=""#fn:8"" rel=""footnote"">8</A></SUP> The perimeter and immediate surrounding areas of the site are identified in the Master Plan as the priority area for intervention: <SUP id=""fnref:9""><A href=""#fn:9"" rel=""footnote"">9</A></SUP> a strip of land that houses residential areas such as Boipatong, Tshepiso, Bophelong, Bonanne and agricultural smallholdings”. <SUP id=""fnref:10""><A href=""#fn:10"" rel=""footnote"">10</A></SUP></P><P>The Report noted that the affected aquifers “can generally not be remediated to acceptable risk levels through technical measures, over the short and medium terms. Such measures will require flushing of the aquifers with ‘clean’ water and/or steam and will in any event take several decades to improve the situation significantly”. <SUP id=""fnref:11""><A href=""#fn:11"" rel=""footnote"">11</A></SUP></P><P>The Master Plan produced and prioritised 220 recommendations for action, and also divided them into measures that were regarded as: feasible, leading to a number of big remediation and technology update processes; and those that were too difficult or expensive and “technically impracticable”, which would be subject to “institutional measures”, that is, where remediation would not take place, but measures like a buffer zone created by the bulldozing of the Steel Valley houses would be put in place.</P><P>In many instances, it seems that “institutional measures” were preferred by AMSA over “technical measures” as means to remediate <mark>pollution</mark>, due to the “technical Impracticability” to remediate certain areas in the plant “to levels that will represent acceptable risk to human health and the environment”. <SUP id=""fnref:12""><A href=""#fn:12"" rel=""footnote"">12</A></SUP></P><P>It is important to note that the Master Plan was commissioned by AMSA, and community organisations have now started the arduous process of assessing the quality of the evidence provided by the Master Plan. Initial findings by expert and scientist of Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide in the USA, Dr Mark Chernaik, have pointed out that, given that groundwater samples taken as part of the Master Plan reports showed detectable levels of cadmium, “cadmium toxicity should have been, but was not, a main focus of the investigation of groundwater contamination in the vicinity of AMSA”. Chronic exposures to very low levels of cadmium can cause renal dysfunction, including kidney failure. Residents of Steel Valley have long alleged significant health impacts from water <mark>pollution</mark> in the area.</P><H2>Measures taken by AMSA as at 2014</H2><P>The Master Plan was released with a summary report by AMSA compiled in 2014 “to place the so-called Vanderbijlpark ‘Master Plans’ and the progress made in terms of Environmental Management at this facility into perspective”. This summary essentially records measures taken by AMSA since the Master Plan was compiled – measures that AMSA says has cost hundreds of millions of rands to date. At least some of these measures were taken only after AMSA was directed to do so by the Green Scorpions.</P><P>In December 2014, new AMSA CEO Paul O’Flaherty announced that AMSA was committed to dealing with its “legacy” of environmental problems “openly and transparently” and stated that, “we intend reaching out and holding an NGO forum as quickly as we can … to talk through these issues,” O’Flaherty added that the group had “nothing to hide” and would adopt a “proactive” stance towards stakeholders. <SUP id=""fnref:13""><A href=""#fn:13"" rel=""footnote"">13</A></SUP></P><P>While these sentiments are to be welcomed, historical liabilities remain. Adequate rehabilitation measures must be completed, and those who have suffered must be compensated.</P><H2>Public access to the Master Plan</H2><P>Copies of the Master Plan have been archived in various places for public access, including the <A href=""http://www.saha.org.za/collections/the_centre_for_environmental_rights_cer_collection.htm"">online archive of the non-profit South African History Archive</A>, and the Northwest University, Vaal Campus.</P><P><EM>Melissa Fourie is executive director of the Centre for Environmental Rights, a non-profit law clinic and advocacy organisation that works to advance environmental rights in South Africa and to give a voice to communities affected by environmental rights violations.

The draft, released last year, predicted the calamities that unfolded across the coastal Cape regions this month: “Communities may experience increased exposure to raging fires, exacerbated by changes in climatic conditions like extended, dry, hot spells and fanned by strong, unseasonal winds.”</P><P>And: “Communities located in a different province may experience extensive floods caused by excessive downpours, sea level rise, ageing stormwater infrastructure or inadequate designs to deal with the rate of urban growth and development in recent years.” </P><P>Knysna’s incident commander, Richard Geldenhuys, told media this week: “The scale and intensity [of the fire], mixed with the drought and intense weather conditions, made it impossible to deal with.” </P><P>A thousand firefighters were drafted in from the rest of the country to help. </P><P>Once a narrative of the future, of 2030 and 2050, the increase in extreme events are realities that countries are having to deal with now. The reason for this requires no debate: human emissions of greenhouse gases — from cars to smokestacks — are warming the planet. The concentration of the most plentiful of those gases, <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, is at a higher level than at any time in human history.</P><P>People and nature have adapted to <mark>climate change</mark> in the past. But, as the National Adaptation Strategy states, the “unprecedented pace of current changes” makes doing this harder. </P><P>Cognisant of this, South Africa joined nearly 200 other countries in signing the Paris Agreement in 2015 to lower greenhouse gas emissions. But, even if all emissions were stopped now, the gases already in the atmosphere will continue to warm the world for the coming century. </P><P>Therefore, South Africa has to plan for the worst and hope for the best. Either way, the roughly predictable 18-year weather cycle of droughts and floods is coming to an end. The extremes of that cycle have led to damage. According to the latest summary the government sent to the United Nation’s <mark>climate</mark> agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, damaging events cost R2-billion a year throughout the noughties. But, in the seven years since, that figure has jumped to R6-billion a year. </P><P>Record hot years in 2014, 2015 and 2016 have exacerbated South Africa’s three main natural disasters: drought, flood and veld fires. That has meant more than three years of constantly dealing with disaster declarations and crisis response throughout the country. </P><P>Although temperatures cannot be controlled, the ability of society and the economy to handle the related disasters, known as resilience, can be strengthened. Hence the adaptation strategy. Its targets are enshrined in the 2014 to 2019 medium-term strategic framework. This requires the government to do things such as sustaining ecosystems, so they can act as a buffer when disaster strikes — such as wetlands, which catch and slow down flash floods so the water does not wash away homes — and ensuring there’s a disaster response system in place. </P><P>Some work on this is being done. A local green fund, with R800-million in funds, is backing projects that increase people’s resilience. It is supporting initiatives such as a R232-million aquaculture project in the Camdeboo municipality of the Eastern Cape. </P><P>In Cape Town, a rapid decrease in the cost of desalination technology means the city could get a third of its water from the ocean. The various Working For programmes are creating tens of thousands of jobs in rural areas, while looking after wetlands and getting rid of thirsty invasive plant species. Eight hundred of their firefighters are fighting the Knysna fires. </P><P>But it is not enough. Adapting to <mark>climate change</mark> is something that the country’s 226 local municipalities, 19 government departments and parastatals must focus on and work together on. Many aren’t. The adaptation strategy warns: “Institutional fragmentation poses enormous challenges to co-ordination, which is compounded by the fact that few departments, apart from environmental affairs, view <mark>climate change</mark> as a priority in their sector.” </P><P>Put more bluntly by an official in the co-operative governance department: “Our <mark>climate</mark> crisis is here but, at best, the different departments have an office that they dedicate to the problem — because they have to.” </P><P>Officials and researchers in other departments, parastatals and groups such as the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research have all expressed similar frustrations. </P><P>Each government entity has to create a <mark>climate change</mark> plan, and most have. But that’s as far as they get. </P><P>The National Development Plan, which should be pulling these plans together to do things such as bolster resilience to storms and droughts, is not being implemented. </P><P>Mines continue to get permission to dig up wetlands and cities still allow shopping centres to be built on endangered grassland. </P><P><mark>Climate change</mark>, an issue that should be at the heart of all planning, is left on the periphery, treated as a luxury. The result will be death and destruction. Research by Stanford University last year warned that this country’s gross domestic product could shrink by 66% by 2100 as a result of <mark>climate change</mark> destroying the ecosystems that life relies on. </P></DIV><SECTION class=""author-profile section-clear""><DIV class=""author-container""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-xs-12 col-md-9""><ARTICLE><HEADER class=""section-header-other header-bg-other""><H3>Sipho Kings</H3></HEADER><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-xs-12 col-md-12 author-description author-bio""><BLOCKQUOTE>Sipho Kings is the Mail &amp; Guardian's environment reporter.

In this economic <mark>climate</mark> and with the ongoing power, labour and consumable cost pressures, ArcMittal faces a difficult challenge.ArcMittal has been implementing various measures to improve its operating and financial performance, including a restructuring of the corporate services departments. This process was concluded in 2015.The harsh reality is that the profitability of the operations remain under pressure. It was envisaged that a larger portion of the additional volumes of steel from the recently relined Newcastle furnace would be consumed domestically. However, since the commissioning of the Newcastle furnace, the local market has been affected by a surge in imports and local demand, combined with a challenging export market, has been weaker than expected.This has resulted in the need to consider additional cost saving and optimisation initiatives. Shareholders are advised that ArcMittal will be exploring further initiatives to ensure its sustainability. While the closure of some plant cannot be excluded should circumstances not change, the immediate priority will be a focus on the alternatives that can be implemented to avoid such a situation. In order to optimise the long steel business, the company is also considering various options, including moving all billet production from its Vereeniging Works to the newly relined and more efficient Newcastle furnace. The impact of such an initiative is being assessed together with other alternatives.In this regard ArcMittal will be engaging with its stakeholders, including organized labour and undertaking an industrial footprint review of its Vereeniging Works with a view to considering alternatives and deciding on whether mothballing some of its plants and placing others under care and maintenance would be a prudent decision. This initial process is expected to be completed by the end of August 2015. Should a final decision be taken to proceed along this path, it will not be taken lightly.As South Africa?s leading steel producer, the sustainability of the local steel industry remains ArcMittal?s primary concern and the company will continue to engage its stakeholders to find lasting solutions to the challenges faced by the industry.</TD></TR><TR><TD valign=""top"" class=""textCell"" width=""150"">23-Jul-2015<SPAN style=""font-weight:normal;"">(Official Notice)</SPAN></TD><TD valign=""top"" class=""dataCell"">In terms of paragraph 3.4 (b) of the JSE Ltd.

While the full judgment will be made available on Tuesday, 20 December 2011, the North Gauteng High Court has declared that the terms of the converted mineral rights granted to Sishen Iron Ore Mining Company Ltd (&quot;SIOC&quot;) in 2008 gave SIOC 100% of the right over the Sishen mine. The North Gauteng High Court also set aside the grant of the prospecting right to Imperial Crown Trading 289 (Pty) Ltd, and furthermore also found acceptances by the Department of Mineral Resources of all applications for rights to iron ore at SIOC lodged after 2008, including SIOC's application for a 21.4 percent mining right, were void from the outset. The ruling confirms the position that the company has always held that its rights over the 21.4% never lapsed and that SIOC has an ongoing obligation to supply the 6.25Mt of iron ore at cost plus three percent in terms of the existing agreement. Shareholders will be kept informed of any further developments.</TD></TR><TR><TD valign=""top"" class=""textCell"" width=""150"">09-Dec-2011<SPAN style=""font-weight:normal;"">(Official Notice)</SPAN></TD><TD valign=""top"" class=""dataCell"">Subsequent to the institution of arbitration proceedings to determine the mining rights dispute between ArcelorMittal and Sishen Iron Ore Company (Pty) Ltd (&quot;SIOC&quot;), proceedings were instituted by SIOC in the High Court which joined ArcelorMittal as a party thereto.                                             ArcelorMittal and SIOC have agreed that it is not possible for the arbitration to proceed prior to the finalisation of the High Court proceedings. The issues to be determined in the High Court impact directly on the fundamental premise of SIOC`s contentions in the arbitration, being that SIOC was awarded a 78.6% mining right. ArcelorMittal contends in the High Court proceedings that SIOC was, as a matter of fact and law, awarded a 100% mining right. If this issue is determined in ArcelorMittal`s favour in the High Court proceedings, it will effectively negate the aforesaid basis of SIOC`s contentions in the arbitration which may render the arbitration academic. ArcelorMittal`s legal representatives have advised ArcelorMittal that, as a matter of law, the arbitration cannot proceed until ArcelorMittal`s contentions have been finally resolved in court.            There is a real prospect that, having regard to the importance of the matters in issue, the unsuccessful parties will apply for leave to the Supreme Court of Appeal who will be required to determine the highly complex, legal and factual issues which have arisen in these proceedings. Such hearing before the Supreme Court of Appeal is likely to take place before the end of next year. ArcelorMittal remains confident of its prospects of success in both the High Court and arbitration proceedings. ArcelorMittal will publish a further announcement in due course containing the salient aspects of the High Court judgment subsequent to the judgment being handed down and will continue to keep shareholders informed of any further material developments in this matter.</TD></TR><TR><TD valign=""top"" class=""textCell"" width=""150"">03-Nov-2011<SPAN style=""font-weight:normal;"">(C)</SPAN></TD><TD valign=""top"" class=""dataCell"">Revenue increased to R7.6 million (R7.2 million).

Chief financial officer Aditya Mittal said 2011 should be better than 2010, even if growth of demand is lower.Mr Mittal added that the second quarter should be stronger than the first, when ArcelorMittal's furnaces would run at 76% of capacity, compared to 69% last year.</TD></TR><TR><TD valign=""top"" class=""textCell"" width=""150"">08-Feb-2011<SPAN style=""font-weight:normal;"">(C)</SPAN></TD><TD valign=""top"" class=""dataCell"">Revenue increased to R30.2 billion (R25.6 billion) and profit from operations grew to R2.2 billion (R229 million).

DividendNo dividend was declared for the period under review. ProspectsWith the expected increase in demand for steel and higher international steel prices, a significant turnaround in earnings is anticipated for the first quarter 2011 compared to the loss for the last quarter of 2010. This will be partially offset by an increase in some raw material prices, mainly scrap. Changes in the Rand/US Dollar exchange rate will have an important impact on earnings.</TD></TR><TR><TD valign=""top"" class=""textCell"" width=""150"">19 Jan 2011 08:08:06<SPAN style=""font-weight:normal;"">(Official Notice)</SPAN></TD><TD valign=""top"" class=""dataCell"">Shareholders of ArcMittal were referred to the announcement dated 10 August 2010, informing shareholders that ArcMittal has entered into a subscription and shareholders' agreement, to give effect to the BEE transaction; and to the renewal of cautionary announcements dated 30 August 2010, 21 October 2010 and 2 December 2010.

The offer for all Baffinland's shares and all its 2007 warrants would make the deal worth more than CAD492 million, Baffinland vice-chairwoman Daniella Dimitrov said.

Nyembezi- Heita added that the company would implement a new shift rotation that would see the introduction of a fourth team. This meant that instead of the current three-shift system, which involves an excessive amount of overtime, ArcelorMittal was going to introduce an additional team to cut overtime. It is a two-three year programme that will demand 1400 permanent employees. An extra shift will be introduced in Newcastle and Van der Bijl Park, which will translate into 1400 new jobs in the company.</TD></TR><TR><TD valign=""top"" class=""textCell"" width=""150"">26 Oct 2010 08:20:19<SPAN style=""font-weight:normal;"">(C)</SPAN></TD><TD valign=""top"" class=""dataCell"">Revenue rose to R7.2 billion (R6.9 billion), profit from operations soared to R365 million (R30 million), profit attributable to ordinary shareholders was recorded at R64 million (loss of R72 million).

Arcmittal was named in Zimbabwe this month as being among five bidders for Zisco, after the canning of an earlier bidding round in which the South African steel maker was rejected, reportedly on grounds that it was too big, along with India?s Jindal Steel and Power. Adding Zisco to its assets would bolster Arcmittal's integrated asset amid a protracted dispute with Kumba Iron Ore.</TD></TR><TR><TD valign=""top"" class=""textCell"" width=""150"">21 Oct 2010 13:29:25<SPAN style=""font-weight:normal;"">(Official Notice)</SPAN></TD><TD valign=""top"" class=""dataCell"">Shareholders are referred to the previous announcement from the company relating to Sishen Iron Ore Company (Pty) Ltd (&quot;SIOC), released on 22 July 2010 where it was announced that an interim pricing arrangement has been reached between SIOC and AMSA in respect of the supply of iron ore to AMSA from the Sishen mine and the announcement released on 30 August 2010 when the cautionary was renewed.

Zimbabwean state media quoted Welshman Ncube, the industry and commerce minister, as saying the government had received five offers, among them fresh bids from Arcmittal SA and India's Jindal Steel and Power. Both were short-listed in an earlier round of bidding but their bids were rejected in May. Arcmittal SA, which is majority-owned by the world's biggest steel producer, was said to be too big whereas Zimbabwe preferred medium sized investors.

The Vanderbijlpark Works in the former region is one of the world’s largest inland steel mills and the biggest supplier of flat steel products in sub-Saharan Africa.</P><P class=""Body"">Across its four major facilities, ArcelorMittal South Africa has a sizeable local capacity from which to manufacture products for the heavy engineering, construction, mining, automotive, furniture, cabling, fencing and fertiliser industries. This commonly includes slabs, plates, cold and hot rolled coil (HRC), galvanised, tinplate, Corex, Midrex, billet rebar and other bars and rods.</P><P class=""Body"">Showcasing its depth of technical and managerial expertise across not only its primary business vertical, the Company also has interests in coking coal and is able to process and beneficiate metallurgical and steel products into coal tar pitch.</P><P class=""Body"">With domestic sales accounting for 90 percent of its revenue, the Company proudly contributed R43 billion to South Africa’s economy in 2015, an amount equivalent to 1.1 percent of the country’s GDP. This is further compounded by a team of 9,315 permanent employees, in addition to supporting more than 90,000 jobs directly and indirectly across South Africa, as well as investing a total of R12.6 million back into local communities in 2015, impacting 18,300 people through a multitude of socio-economic development initiatives.</P><P class=""Body""><B>Innovative and creative investments</B></P><P class=""Body"">With the recent economic <mark>climate</mark> presenting difficult trading conditions, ArcelorMittal South Africa has adapted and restructured several internal departments to optimise its operations. Over the past few years, the Company formed a Business Improvement division to continuously identify and implement measures to improve operational and financial performance in a bid to regain local market share; a feat which has become increasingly challenging as a result of Chinese imports and over-supply in the market.</P><P class=""Body"">Dean Subramanian, ArcelorMittal South Africa’s Acting Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in 2016 explained at the time: “Until last year [2015], South Africa was one of only two steel-producing countries (out of a total of 69) that did not have protection measures in place to counter the impact of foreign imports. Based on the recent approval of import duties by the International Trade and Administration Commission (ITAC), I am confident that stability will be restored in the coming years.”</P><P class=""Body"">He continued to say: “Our innovative and creative investments in research and development (R&amp;D), as well as the significant spending allocated to environmental and health &amp; safety initiatives, will also serve to counter over-supply and distinguish us from the competition; boosting efficiencies and optimising costs. We continually monitor the quality of our products and are quick to respond and address any problems by applying the necessary knowledge and technology to find a solution.”</P><P class=""Body"">Benchmarking itself against similar manufacturing plants through the Global Technical Benchmark System used by the Group, ArcelorMittal South Africa also embraces the latest technologies that can enhance and streamline business activity.</P><P class=""Body"">“We are continuously working to increase the level of automation in all our plants and now utilise SAP as standard across our ERP systems. Moreover, on a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) level, we have adopted various bespoke developed systems,” Subramanian detailed during the interview.</P><P class=""Body"">In spite of the industry slowdown, the Company has experienced growth in the automotive and renewable sectors in particular, due to increased localisation of products and the need to develop higher grades of steel. </P><P class=""Body"">“There has been huge but somewhat erratic growth in the renewable energy sector in recent years and we have been working hard to extend our product range in relation to steel plate products for wind turbines, which are largely being imported from China,” he added.</P><P class=""Body"">“Similarly, the rising cost of electricity in South Africa means that we are making internal investments in energy efficiency initiatives and exploring viable alternative sources of power generation.”</P><P class=""Body""><B>Future requirements</B></P><P class=""Body"">Working closely with the South African Government to identify and implement various measures to ensure the sustainability of the local steel industry - including the introduction of import tariffs on 10 locally-produced steel products as well as the consideration of anti-dumping measures - ArcelorMittal South Africa continues to work with the best interests of the wider economy in mind.</P><P class=""Body"">“First and foremost, we are a proudly South African steel-producing Company and this is heavily reflected in our emphasis on local employment, B-BBEE emphasis, and community and Government involvement,” said Subramanian, who has since been replaced by the current Chief Executive Officer, Wim De Klerk. “Our employment strategy is designed to provide local opportunity through apprenticeships, learnerships, bursaries and other skills development initiatives to ensure there is a pool of qualified talent available to meet both current and future requirements.</P><P class=""Body"">“In partnership with the Department of Science and Technology and the Department of Education, our Science Centres represent our biggest investment in the local communities in which we operate; providing local students with extra tuition in science, technology, English and mathematics (STEM subjects). In 2016, our flagship Science Centre in Sebokeng is celebrating 10 years of existence, and we plan to celebrate this milestone with the former learners who have been part of the initiative.”</P><P class=""Body"">Policies and procedures at ArcelorMittal South Africa ensure that all employees are afforded with equal opportunities and individual progression. The Company’s Transformation department has also undertaken a robust and ambitious programme to develop local entrepreneurs via a six-month pilot programme in partnership with the Vaal University of Technology aimed at enhancing the skills of local business people. The division also launched an industrial and manufacturing hub later in 2016 which provided at least 12 local fabricators with a facility to work from, access to markets and the opportunity to exchange ideas.</P><P class=""Body"">“We are cognisant of the role that we play in the socio-economic development of local communities and as the country’s and the region’s largest steel producer, we will work with all stakeholders to ensure the sustainability of the South African steel industry for the benefit of all stakeholders,” Subramanian further detailed in regards to the launch last year.</P><P class=""Body""><B>Important steps</B></P><P class=""Body"">The global steel industry contributes enormously to the growth and development of economies around the world. With the crisis in the steel industry continuing unabated, it is more important than ever before to ensure that ArcelorMittal’s Group-wide stakeholders understand the threat to the industry and the implication for national and local economies.</P><P class=""Body"">“We are focused on stabilising the business and returning our operations to profitability. Above all, we aspire to be the preferred steel producer on the African continent as we understand what steel products are needed to satisfy the demand,” noted Subramanian in a sentiment no doubt echoed by De Klerk since taking up the post.</P><P class=""Body"">On a local scale in South Africa, the Company is more than half-way through its 2012-2019 strategy, which will grow ArcelorMittal’s footprint on the continent even more extensively.</P><P class=""Body"">Subramanian rounded up the remaining goals for 2016 and 2017, onwards: “We hope to double our tin product capabilities for the packaging market, continue modifying our facilities to produce galvanised products for the automotive industry, bolster our construction market offering, and conduct a mini-reline of our blast furnace at Saldanha to extend the life of our operations. </P><P class=""Body""> “The global steel crisis has undoubtedly affected our business and we have had to respond swiftly and decisively to ensure that we survive into the future. We are confident that with the important steps we have taken - together with the positive interventions agreed by Government - that we will be able to turn the business around in the medium-term. We will continue our engagements with the Government to ensure that the necessary protection measures are fully implemented, including the designation of locally produced steel for use in Government infrastructure projects.”</P><P class=""Body"">And with the inception of a new Arcelor Centre in Isando; R12.6 million spent on three science centres; a five-year pricing plan in place with the Government to aid the consistent price of steel; the imminent introduction of two internal programmes; and the ongoing raising of funds in order to refurbish and update all of its facilities - the aforementioned important steps are continuing to be taken to compound ArcelorMittal’s stronghold on the industry in South Africa.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER><DIV class=""container""><DIV class=""footer-R1""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-md-12""><DIV style=""text-align: center;""><DIV class=""caption""><B> Contact Us </B></DIV>

The agreement relates to various cases that the Commission has investigated against AMSA, some of which were subsequently referred to the Tribunal for adjudication.</P><P>The following is a summary of the cases and the Commission’s findings.</P><P><STRONG>Investigations and findings</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Scrap metal cartel:</STRONG> In December 2009, the Commission initiated an investigation against the consumers of scrap, namely AMSA, Highveld, Cape Gate, CISCO and Columbus Stainless for collusive practices. The Commission’s investigation found that AMSA, Columbus Steel, Cape Gate and Scaw fixed the purchase price of scrap metal. In this regard, the Commission found that these firms collectively negotiated and agreed a standard formula which was used to determine the purchase price of scrap metal as a buyers’ cartel.</P><P>The Commission found that AMSA and Columbus Steel, Cape Gate and Scaw collaborated and acted in tandem with the upstream cartel of scrap merchants. In August 2013, the Commission referred this matter to the Tribunal for adjudication.</P><P><STRONG>The long steel cartel:</STRONG> In April 2008, the Commission initiated an investigation against long and flat steel producers in South Africa, including AMSA. This investigation was initiated following concerns about high and increasing prices of steel products observed by the Commission despite South Africa being a net exporter of steel. As part of the investigation, on 19 June 2008, the Commission conducted a dawn raid at the premises of Cape Town Iron and Steel Works, Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation Limited, and the South African Iron and Steel Institute. Subsequently, Scaw South Africa, a subsidiary of Anglo American, applied for and was granted leniency for its involvement in collusive practices.</P><P>The Commission’s investigation found that AMSA, CISCO, Scaw and Cape Gate, being competitors in the manufacturing of long steel products, engaged in collusion by fixing prices and discounts, allocating customers and sharing commercially sensitive information through the South African Iron and Steel Institute 2 (SAISI) and the South African Reinforced Concrete Engineers’ Association. The Commission referred its findings to the Tribunal for prosecution.</P><P><STRONG>The flat steel cartel:</STRONG> In April 2008, the Commission initiated an investigation against flat steel producers Highveld and AMSA. The Commission found that during the period 1999 and 2009, AMSA and Highveld had an understanding in terms of which Highveld would follow AMSA’s lead on pricing in the flat steel market. The Commission also found that AMSA and Highveld used the industry association, SAISI, to exchange commercially sensitive information, such as sales volumes. This conduct constituted price fixing and market allocation in contravention of the Competition Act. On 30 March 2012, the Commission referred a complaint against AMSA and Highveld to the Tribunal.</P><P><STRONG>The Barnes Fencing complaints:</STRONG> In December 2003, the Commission received complaints from Barnes Fencing Industries, F&amp;G Quality Tubes and Dunrose Trading (against AMSA and various wire producers. The complaints alleged that AMSA differentiated between its customers in terms of discounts offered for low <mark>carbon</mark> wire rod and that this conduct amounted to price discrimination in contravention of the Competition Act. The Commission’s investigations found that AMSA engaged in the conduct of price discrimination in contravention of the Competition Act. This complaint concerned the period 2000 to 2003.</P><P>The complaints were referred to the Tribunal for adjudication in January 2007. In the second complaint received in December 2008, the same complainants alleged that the conduct complained of in the first complaint had continued from 2004 to 2006. The Commission referred the second complaint to the Tribunal in November 2012.</P><P><STRONG>The excessive pricing complaint</STRONG>: In July 2011, the Commission initiated a complaint into AMSA’s pricing policy for its flat steel products based on a complaint by the Department of Trade and Industry. The investigation pertained to AMSA allegedly charging excessive prices for its flat steel products in contravention of the Competition Act. The Commission has not made a finding in this matter.</P><P><STRONG>Agreed terms of settlement</STRONG></P><P>The Commission and AMSA have agreed to resolve the above complaints on the following terms:</P><P>Three admissions: AMSA admits that it engaged in collusion with CISCO, Scaw and Cape Gate by fixing prices and discounts, allocating customers and sharing commercially sensitive information in the market for the manufacture of long steel products, in contravention of the Competition Act.</P><P>AMSA also admits that it fixed the purchased price of scrap metal with Columbus Steel, Cape Gate and Scaw.</P><P>In respect of the flat steel complaint and the Barnes Fencing complaints, AMSA admits the conduct as alleged by the Commission but does not admit that this conduct constituted a contravention of the Competition Act. In relation to the pricing complaint, AMSA does not admit that it acted in contravention of the Competition Act. However, it has agreed to remedies to address competition concerns arising from its pricing conduct.</P><P><STRONG>Administrative penalty:</STRONG> AMSA has agreed to pay an administrative penalty in the amount of R1.5 billion in five annual instalments of no less than R300 million.</P><P><STRONG>Pricing remedy for flat steel products:</STRONG> AMSA has agreed that it shall for a period of five years not be permitted to earn an earnings-before-interest-and-tax margin percentage greater than 10% relating to flat steel products sold in South Africa over a 12 months period linked to AMSA’s financial year.</P><P>The 10% margin cap is subject to variation up to a maximum of 15% if certain market circumstances set out in the settlement agreement arise.</P><P><STRONG>Capital investment:</STRONG> As part of the settlement agreement, AMSA has committed a R4.64 billion capital expenditure over five years.</P><P>“The Commission is delighted to bring an end to these longstanding proceedings. The penalty sends a strong message of deterrence and is an important milestone in the Commission’s enforcement against cartels,” said Commissioner Tembinkosi Bonakele.</P><P>“In addition, the pricing remedy reflects our desire to protect South African consumers against dominant firms, particularly on key industrial products. This remedy is a safeguard in the event that AMSA were to revert to the historical prices that the Commission regards as excessive.”</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Earlier this year, Treasury published the draft <mark>Carbon</mark> Tax Act, indicating it wanted to start taxing emitters at the beginning of next year.</P><P>The regulations are an addendum to the bill, ­setting out the conditions of the rebates and ­offsets, and explaining how it will work.</P><P>A <mark>carbon</mark> tax could be a lucrative income for the fiscus, adding R13.7 billion, according to Treasury estimates. It would start at R120 per ton of CO<SPAN>2</SPAN>, but be reduced with the rebates and offsets.</P><P><mark>Carbon</mark> tax aims to put a price on <mark>pollution</mark> and encourage heavy emitters to change their ways, while also aligning South Africa with its international commitments to reduce its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. Big industry in South Africa has been fighting against the controversial <mark>carbon</mark> tax for half a ­decade.</P><P>Thava Govender, Eskom’s group executive for transmission and sustainability, welcomed the ­inclusion of the offsets in the draft, but warned that the long lead times required to ­deliver these projects could ­limit their effectiveness.</P><P>The new regulations suggest that companies could reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> tax burden by ­between 5% and 10% of their ­total greenhouse gas emissions by investing in projects that ­reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>The projects must fall under ­international standards such as the ­European ­Union’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the Verified <mark>Carbon</mark> Standard and the Gold Standard.</P><P>Govender said Eskom had several projects in the process of registration with international accreditation bodies, but the utility would have to examine their eligibility.</P><P>Green lobbyists are also sceptical. World Wildlife Fund SA said this week that on its own, the offset programme would not lead to a massive reduction, and nongovernmental organisation Earthlife Africa called it a false solution for <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>David Hallowes, an energy researcher at ­environmental justice nonprofit organisation groundWork, said the new <mark>carbon</mark> tax offset added unnecessary complexity.</P><P>“We think this is a disastrous policy largely driven by Treasury’s faith in markets.”</P><P>Hallowes said the offsets didn’t work, and that some CDM projects actually resulted in increased emissions. “They invite scamming of all sorts, as happened in the European Union [EU].”</P><P>Last year, green think-tank the Stockholm ­Environment Institute questioned the EU trading scheme, saying it “significantly undermined”­efforts to tackle <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>In some projects, chemicals known to exacerbate global warming were created and then ­destroyed to claim cash.</P><P>Izak Swart, director at Deloitte, said that to get CDM and Gold Standard projects registered was burdensome and administratively complex.</P><P>Despite the lukewarm response to the new tax, the industry, including Eskom and major power users, believed that putting a price on <mark>carbon</mark> to cut emissions was the way to go. But they agreed that a <mark>carbon</mark> tax was not the solution.</P><P>Nevertheless, Swart said the world was moving towards putting a price on <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>According to the World Bank, about 12% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions were subject to a <mark>carbon</mark> price in 2015, and this, Swart believed, would only grow in the future.</P><P>“I do believe that South Africa needs a form of <mark>carbon</mark> pricing,” he said.</P><P>“The recent Paris agreement will reinforce this. If we don’t have some sort of pricing mechanism, our exports to countries that do have <mark>carbon</mark> pricing may be jeopardised.”</P><P>The Energy Intensive Users Group of Southern Africa said that the instrument to price <mark>carbon</mark> should be determined based on global agreements to avoid certain countries having an advantage in trade.</P><P>Swart said the proposed <mark>carbon</mark> tax was ostensibly being introduced to change behaviour, but that there were better methods to do so.</P><P>“For instance, why not impose a realistic limit on what a company can emit? Should the company exceed the limit, it should be subject to a significant tax.”</P><P>Eskom also questioned the <mark>carbon</mark> tax, notwithstanding its “constructive engagements” with Treasury. Govender said <mark>carbon</mark> was already priced through a limit on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.</P><P>Sasol spokesperson Alex Anderson also believed the <mark>carbon</mark> tax would not change behaviour. </P><P>“On this basis, we believe that the current <mark>carbon</mark> budget ­approach being implemented by the department of environmental affairs is the most ­appropriate instrument. ­Currently, <mark>carbon</mark> tax is not aligned with this.”</P><P>Themba Sepotokele, spokes­person for ArcelorMittal SA, said the <mark>carbon</mark> tax’s intended goal – to change ­behaviour – was limited in the steel industry ­because no alternative technologies were available to lower <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by the percentages called for.</P><P>“A proposal that would make more sense is an emission allocation system with fair allocations. If such an allocation is exceeded, then a tax can be levied,” he said. “Our engagement with government is continuing.”</P><P>Sepotokele said <mark>carbon</mark> tax would significantly affect the company’s bottom line. ArcelorMittal SA’s direct emissions are in the region of 11 million tons a year, making the company liable to pay R320 million in <mark>carbon</mark> tax. This takes into account the tax-free thresholds.</P><P>“We’ve not made a profit in more than five years, and the addition financial burden will further ­impede our drive to regain profitability.”</P><P>Eskom said its calculations showed that if a company takes advantage of all possible tax-free allowances, the value of a ton of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is expected to be R42.</P><P>Based on Eskom’s reported emission to the JSE’s voluntary disclosure project, the state utility emitted 233 million tons last year, bringing its <mark>carbon</mark> tax bill to an estimated R9.8 billion a year.</P><P>Swart calculated that a company that emits 100 000 tons of greenhouse gases would, without the offset allowance, be subject to a <mark>carbon</mark> tax of R4.8 million.</P><P>“If the company qualifies for the offset allowance, and let’s assume it is 10%, the <mark>carbon</mark> tax would reduce to R3.6 million.”</P></DIV><DIV id=""keywords_listing""><H4>Read more on:</H4></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

The high level trends show that over the last nine years there has been an improvement in both disclosure and performance scores, as well as an overall reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by the JSE 100. However, the emission reductions achieved in the recent years do not meet required global and national reduction targets. This article highlights the key findings and trends observed by the CDP over the period:</P><P><STRONG>South Africa’s highest emitters</STRONG></P><P>The latest CDP report states that the majority of the <mark>carbon</mark> emissions emitted in South Africa are from a few large companies. Eskom is the highest direct emitter by far in South Africa, with emission figures of 233,4000,000 t<mark>CO2</mark>e for 2015. Eskom does not form part of the JSE 100 but does voluntarily report to the CDP.</P><P>The JSE 100’s ten largest public emitters in 2015, emitted 177,000,000 t<mark>CO2</mark>e which equates to 85% of the JSE 100 total scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. The list includes: Sasol Limited, BHP Billiton, Anglo American, Arcelor Mittal South Africa Ltd, Anglo American Platinum, Mondi PLC, Sappi, Sibanye Gold Ltd, AngloGold Ashanti, and PPC Ltd. The graph below illustrates South Africa’s JSE 100 top four emitters and their emissions over the 2009 – 2015 period. The graph shows a gradual decrease over the reporting years.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Emissions reductions</STRONG></P><P>Using a “like for like” comparison of 45 companies that consistently reported to the SA CDP, scope 1 and 2 emissions for these companies declined by 11.5% from 2009 to 2015. The report highlights that external factors such as load shedding and the global financial crisis could have potentially influenced this reduction. In addition, although emissions data reported to the CDP indicates a steady decrease since 2007, companies are still not achieving significant GHG emissions reductions.</P><P><STRONG>Increasing GHG reduction targets and emission reduction activities</STRONG></P><P>The CDP report highlights that the number of companies setting specific emission reduction targets has increased from 18 (34%) in 2008 to 58 (78%) in 2015, and more emission reduction activities (ERAs) have been implemented over the reporting years. These ERAs have benefitted companies through total monetary savings equivalent to R 6.7 billion, from 2011 to 2015 and a total of 16.8 million tonnes CO<SUB>2</SUB>e emission savings from 2012 – 2015.</P><P><STRONG>Improved disclosure and performance scores</STRONG></P><P>The response rate over the reporting period has increased from 58% in 2008 to 79% in 2015 with a similar trend observed in the median disclosure scores which increased from 71 in 2008 to 96 in 2015. Additionally, 99% of companies now report their scope 1 and scope 2 emissions which is up from 75% in 2008. Based on these disclosure and performance scores<STRONG>, </STRONG>South Africa has grown to become one of the best responding countries in the world with a response rate percentage of 80% as last recorded in 2014. However little improvement has been observed regarding the reporting of scope three emissions.</P><P><STRONG>Companies integrating <mark>climate change</mark> into governance activities</STRONG></P><P>More companies are integrating <mark>climate change</mark> into their governance activities which shows increased awareness and effort from companies. Since 2008, the percentage of companies that have <mark>climate change</mark> issues overseen by a board has increased from 75 -100%; the percentage of companies that have integrated <mark>climate change</mark> into their risk management strategies has increased from 74-97%; and the percentage of companies that have integrated <mark>climate change</mark> into their business strategies has increased from 80 – 95%.</P><P><STRONG>Moving towards improving the accessibility of <mark>carbon</mark> data</STRONG></P><P>The CDP’s high level trends of the 2007-2015 period can be found in the infographic attached below. The series of infographics has been released together with an <A href=""http://www.nbi.org.za/assets/downloads/CDP_South%20Africa_Executive_Summary_2015.pdf"">executive summary</A> which highlights <mark>carbon</mark> emissions reporting trends in 2015 and over the nine year period.

Their coke plant, Zdzieszowice, was over-allocated 940,265 permits in 2012 alone, while the Kraków coke plant also received a <A href=""http://www.sandbag.org.uk/maps/companymap/"" target=""_blank"">huge surplus</A> of 276,205 permits. According to the UK-based NGO Sandbag, ArcelorMittal has, as of June 2012, a <A href=""http://www.sandbag.org.uk/site_media/pdfs/reports/Losing_the_lead_modified_3.7.2012_1.pdf%20"" target=""_blank"">surplus of 123 million freely allocated <mark>carbon</mark> allowances</A> worth an estimated 1.6 billion euros. This makes it <A href=""http://www.sandbag.org.uk/site_media/pdfs/press_releases/PressRelease_ArcelorMittalORBIT_FIR.pdf"" target=""_blank"">the most oversupplied company</A> in the entire EU ETS.</P><H2>Have your cake and eat it</H2><P>Lakshmi Mittal, billionaire CEO of ArcelorMittal and the UK's richest man, had warned the European Commission in 2006 that “ArcelorMittal is likely to have a large shortage in <mark>CO2</mark> allowances of several Mt/year”. The steel industry is very energy intensive; <A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch7s7-4-1.html"" target=""_blank"">according to the IPCC</A> it is responsible for 6 -7% of global human emissions, and a report by the <mark>Carbon</mark> Trust puts the steel industry's contribution to EU emissions at <A href=""<mark>Carbon</mark>%20Trust,%202010%20http://www.<mark>carbon</mark>trust.com/media/84908/ctc767-tackling-<mark>carbon</mark>-leakage.pdf"" target=""_blank"">20%</A>. Lakshmi Mittal had been successful in convincing the EU member states that unless his company got the permits it wanted, his steely empire would be forced to up and leave Europe to cheaper, but more fossil fuel-intensive, pastures abroad. Despite receiving the desired credits, ArcelorMittal appears to be carrying out its threat nonetheless, as <A href=""http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/steel-layoffs.mbk"">jobs and operations are cut across Europe</A>.</P><H2>Business as Usual</H2><P>ArcelorMittal not only has 123 million excess permits (worth 1.6 billion euros), but is also planning not to sell all of its surplus, and instead keep a significant proportion for future use. For example, it was allocated 184,949,947 allowances in 2009 while its verified emissions were in fact <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/sites/default/files/files/resource/lafarge_arcelor_mittal_jackpot.pdf"">just over half that amount</A> (94,053,080 tons). By holding on to its surplus for use at a later date, there's now nothing whatsoever to make ArcelorMittal reduce its emissions, a situation it's more than happy with.

</P><P>The Court ruled Arcelor's action as inadmissible on the grounds that only companies individually or directly concerned by EU acts can bring a legal challenge to them. It argued that Arcelor is &quot;neither individually nor directly concerned by the directive,&quot; which applies generally to all operators that it covers, including those in pig iron or steel production.</P><P>The EU directive establishing an emissions trading scheme has since 2005 set an absolute cap on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from specified power and industrial sectors (see EURACTIV LinksDossier on the '<A href=""http://www.euractiv.com/en/<mark>climate</mark>-change/eu-emissions-trading-scheme/article-133629"">EU ETS</A>'). It obliges the operators to pay for emission permits for their polluting activities.</P><P>Arcelor, the world's largest steel producer since its merger with Mittal in 2006, applied for the annulment of a number of articles under the EU ETS in 2004, arguing that applying these to pig iron or steel production violates several principles under Community law, including the property rights, the freedom to pursue economic activity and the principle of equal treatment.</P><P>Arcelor argued that the pig iron and steel producers in the EU face a &quot;unique lock-in situation&quot; as they are the only ETS sector that faces competition from sectors that are not covered by the directive: non-ferrous metals and plastics.</P><P>The General Court, previously called the Court of First Instance, also dismissed the steel giant's application for the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to pay for the damages that it has suffered as a result of the contested rules.</P><P>The court decision stated that Arcelor had not proved that the law had &quot;committed a sufficiently serious breach&quot; of the EU's legal principles to justify a liability by the Community.</P><P>This is the second case that Arcelor has lost against the ETS provisions.</P><P>In 2008, the Court of Justice decided that the law did not violate the principle of equal treatment by excluding the chemical and non-ferrous sectors from the first trading phase of the directive. The sectors were added to the scope of the new revised directive for the post-2012 trading period, adopted in 2009.</P><P>Reacting to the decision, ArcelorMittal spokesperson Jean Lasar said while some of the initial shortcomings of the EU ETS which the company criticised in its lawsuit have since been corrected, it remains concerned that the European trading system &quot;might put an excessive strain on the EU steel industry's competitiveness and threaten steelmaking jobs&quot;.</P><P>&quot;This issue will need to be addressed especially with regards to the third trading period of the ETS which starts in 2012,&quot; he added.</P><DIV class=""ea-article-custom""><DIV class=""ea-article-custom-item""><H4>Further Reading</H4><DIV><H3 class=""links-section tid-2"">European Union</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

This means that AMSA must make the documents available to VEJA by 17 December 2014.</P><P>The SCA made a number of critical findings in relation to AMSA’s lack of good faith in its engagement with VEJA and the discrepancies between AMSA’s shareholder communications and its actual conduct. The SCA also emphasised the importance of corporate transparency in relation to environmental issues, stating that “Corporations operating within our borders… must be left in no doubt that, in relation to the environment in circumstances such as those under discussion, there is no room for secrecy and that constitutional values will be enforced”.</P><P>VEJA has been fighting for access to the Master Plan for more than a decade. AMSA has consistently refused to release it. This comprehensive strategy document contains the results of numerous specialist environmental tests for <mark>pollution</mark> levels at AMSA’s Vanderbijlpark facility, as well as its plans to address this <mark>pollution</mark> and rehabilitate its sites over a 20 year period.</P><P>Through its attorneys, the Centre for Environmental Rights, VEJA requested access to the Master Plan using the Promotion of Access to Information Act in late 2011. In February 2012, VEJA also requested records relating to the closure and rehabilitation of the company’s Vaal Disposal Site, situated in Vereeniging, after the company had illegally dumped hazardous waste here. AMSA refused both requests, arguing that VEJA had no right to access the documents.  VEJA then applied to the High Court, which in 2013 upheld VEJA’s arguments and ordered AMSA to release the documents. Instead, AMSA appealed to the SCA.</P><P>In their judgement today, the SCA highlighted the “dangers of a culture of secrecy and unresponsiveness” and berated AMSA’s “obstructive and contrived”, “disingenuous” approach in which it had “feigned ignorance” of the existence of the Master Plan. The judgement highlights AMSA’s history of environmental impacts, pointing out that such impacts are of public interest and importance, and do not only affect persons and communities in the immediate vicinity of its facilities. Navsa ADP points out that AMSA’s approach contradicts its publicly-stated commitment to engage with environmental activists, calling “into question [AMSA’s] stated commitment to collaborative corporate governance in relation to the environment, as well as its bona fides in resisting the request for information”.</P><P>The judgement recognises “the importance of consultation and interaction with the public. After all, environmental degradation affects us all”. As an “advocate of environmental justice”, VEJA is entitled to the information sought and “to monitor the operations of [AMSA] and its effects on the environment”.</P><P>Samson Mokoena, Coordinator at VEJA, states: “This has been a long struggle. This judgement confirms what we have known all along – that we have a Constitutional right to know what AMSA’s impacts are on our health and the environment.  Polluting companies like AMSA can no longer to try to hide this kind of information.”</P><P>According to Bobby Peek, Director of environmental justice NGO groundWork, “Even those who do not live close to AMSA, only have to read the Department of Environmental Affairs’ annual <A title=""NECERs on CER website"" href=""http://cer.org.za/virtual-library/reports/necer"" target=""_blank"">Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Reports</A> to see that AMSA’s activities have serious impacts on human health and the environment. Democracy is not only about relying on government to protect society and the environment, but for people to participate in their democracy, and the SCA case confirms this by ensuring that the VEJA must be given access to documents in order to monitor these environmental impacts”.</P><P>Robyn Hugo, attorney at the CER, states: “This case is about accountability. Industries like AMSA regularly refuse to release environmental information – as basic as licences – to non-government and community organisations. Like AMSA, these companies simultaneously claim – in communications with shareholders and the public – that they constructively engage with stakeholders and/or are committed to transparency. The SCA has confirmed that this approach is not only disingenuous, but unacceptable.”</P><P>The full judgement is available here: <A href=""http://cer.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/VEJA-v-AMSA-SCA-Judgment.pdf"">http://cer.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/VEJA-v-AMSA-SCA-Judgment.pdf</A></P><P>Issued by:</P><UL><LI>Vaal Environmental Justice Alliance (contact <STRONG>Samson Mokoena,</STRONG> Project Coordinator at the VEJA: +27 (0) 16 933 9079 / 084 291 8510</LI><LI>groundWork (contact <STRONG>Bobby Peek, </STRONG>Director at groundWork: +27 (0) 82 464 1383 / <A href=""mailto:bobby@groundwork.org.za"">bobby@groundwork.org.za)</A></LI><LI>Centre for Environmental Rights (<STRONG>Robyn Hugo</STRONG>, Attorney at CER: +27 (0) 28 312 2746 / +27 (0) 82 389 4357 / <A href=""mailto:rhugo@cer.org.za"">rhugo@cer.org.za</A>)</LI></UL><P><STRONG>OTHER SOURCES</STRONG></P><P>Previous press releases about this case:</P><UL><LI>“Vaal environmental organisation takes Amsa to court for withholding records” issued on 31 May 2013 <A href=""http://cer.org.za/news/media-release-vaal-environmental-organisation-takes-arcelormittal-south-africa-to-court-for-withholding-records"">http://cer.org.za/news/media-release-vaal-environmental-organisation-takes-arcelormittal-south-africa-to-court-for-withholding-records</A></LI><LI>“Vaal Environmental Justice Alliance’s struggle against ArcelorMittal South Africa goes to Bloemfontein <A href=""http://cer.org.za/news/media-release-vaal-environmental-justice-alliances-struggle-against-arcelormittal-south-africa-goes-to-bloemfontein"">http://cer.org.za/news/media-release-vaal-environmental-justice-alliances-struggle-against-arcelormittal-south-africa-goes-to-bloemfontein</A></LI></UL><P>A full list of court papers related to this case is accessible here: http://cer.org.za/virtual-library/judgements/vaal-environmental-justice-alliance-v-company-secretary-arcelormittal-sa.</P><P>The Vaal Environmental Justice Alliance (VEJA) is a voluntary association of non-governmental and community-based organisations that advocates for a healthy environment and <mark>sustainable</mark> development in “the Vaal Triangle”.  This is an area of heavy industry and mining in the south of Gauteng, in which two of ArcelorMittal’s major steel-plants are situated, namely its Vanderbijlpark and Vereeniging sites.

Already, Zimbabwe has reported an unspecified number of wild animals and some <A href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/active/12122794/Low-water-levels-at-Victoria-Falls-highlight-southern-Africas-worst-drought-in-30-years.html"">7,000 cattle</A> dying due to low rainfalls.

According to research from the <A href=""https://africacheck.org/2015/04/17/analysis-are-foreigners-stealing-jobs-in-south-africa/"">Migrating for Work Research Consortium</A>, 32.65 percent of international migrants are in the informal sector, compared to 16.57 percent of “non-migrants” and 17.97 percent of “domestic migrants.” The country is among the <A href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-39064642"">top 10 destinations</A> in the world, for migrants looking for safety or a fresh start, according to the office of the South African President.

Therefore, for example, the very poor rural inhabitant might move to the nearest town and stay put. Those with a little more money might migrate to a neighboring country.
However, long distance migration, takes money, time and knowledge. While the communications revolution has spread information and knowledge of other places, money remains the main obstacle to migration around Africa, just as it is for migrants trying to reach Europe. For many people with little in the way of resources, South Africa rather than Europe is seen as the easier choice to escape the problems of <mark>climate change</mark>. For many, the country is seen as a land of opportunity, stability and prosperity.<STRONG>
As for the future</STRONG></P><P>War, famine, religious intolerance and disease were the traditional drivers for migration. Today, we can add economic, political and climatic conditions to this list of cross border migration in sub-Sahara Africa.

Water and Sanitation Minister, Nomvula Mokonyane <A href=""https://www.enca.com/south-africa/sa-will-take-at-least-three-years-to-recover-from-drought-minister"">has said</A> that it is going to take South Africa at least three years to recover from the drought, and even that might not be enough. The Daily Vox looks at who will be affected the most by <mark>climate change</mark> in South Africa.</STRONG></P><P>First of all, are the weather patterns we have been experiencing related to <mark>climate change</mark>?</P><P>Professor Nicholas King, an environmental futurist, says that while it is difficult to attribute individual weather events to <mark>climate change</mark>, all of the models around <mark>climate change</mark> show a much more volatile <mark>climate</mark> or weather patterns, which is exactly what we are seeing.</P><P>“South Africa has already observed a change in <mark>climate</mark> from about 1960 where we have very reliable data. We’ve had higher mean annual temperatures, higher minimum and maximum daily temperatures, more frequent hot extremes and more variable rainfall,” he says.</P><P>So, with a very high level of certainty we can say these events if, not directly attributable to <mark>climate change</mark>, “are in line with what we expect from <mark>climate change</mark> and they are certainly being exacerbated by <mark>climate change</mark>,” says King.</P><P>King also says it is not just the drought, but the country has experienced an increase in temperature so everywhere is hotter and the rainfall is more sporadic. He also says that even if we experience a normal average rainfall, because it is coming in more extreme events, the rain doesn’t soak as much, it runs off quicker, and there’s extreme flood events. So things aren’t going to go back to normal.</P><P>“So again, because we’re getting this change overall, the long-term <mark>climate change</mark>, we can’t go back to normal. There isn’t a normal anymore so it isn’t a cycle like there used to be before. So even if we were to get three years of normal rainfall, because the temperatures are higher, we won’t get back to how we were before. We can’t use the statistical analysis of the past to plan for the future.”</P><P><STRONG>So what is <mark>climate change</mark>?</STRONG></P><P><A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/spms2.html""><STRONG><mark>Climate change</mark></STRONG></A> is a result of global warming, which is caused by human activities that have resulted in the emission of various pollutants, principally <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide.

The report mentions that <mark>climate change</mark> adds pressure on the environment and natural resources which are relied on greatly by South Africans.

</P><P><STRONG> THREE KEY POINTS:</STRONG></P><P>
1. Rising temperatures will affect health. Adelaide currently experiences an average of 17 extremely hot days (above 35 degrees) a year. By 2030 this number could rise to about 23 and will continue to increase in the future. More record hot days and associated heatwaves increase the risk heat related illness and death particularly in the elderly.
</P><P>
2. Changing rainfall patterns combined with higher temperatures pose significant risks to South Australia's agricultural areas and urban water supplies. Droughts will become more severe and drying soil will lead to further warming. This will have significant impacts on South Australia's agricultural belt.
</P><P>
3. Rising sea-level will exacerbate existing vulnerability in South Australia's coastal towns and infrastructure. Sea-levels in South Australia have been rising at a rate higher than the global average with a rise of approximately 4.6 mm a year since 1990 and this trend is set to continue. As a result between 25,200 and 43,000 residential buildings in South Australian could be at risk of flooding towards the end of the century.

Scrapping our renewable energy target signals that maybe they’re not welcome here,” he said. </P><P>A centrepiece of Marshall’s energy security plan is a $200m fund to enhance connections with the national grid, with the only project announced so far a new interconnector with NSW.</P><P>Marshall initially sold the project as an energy security measure, but later began to promote it as a way to sell SA’s excess green energy generation interstate.</P><P>David Blowers, an energy policy specialist at the Grattan Institute, said it will certainly be able to do both, but believes initially it will import more energy from NSW than it will export.</P><P>Longer-term however, he thinks an interconnector might actually incentivise further renewables growth in SA as there will be a bigger market to sell energy to.</P><P>Blowers says an interconnector could take up to nine years to plan and build, and cost well in excess of Marshall’s initial $200m fund. </P><P>“It needs a proper cost-benefit analysis, and promising to do it without that analysis is risky,” he said.</P><P>Then there is the question of what will become of Labor’s plan to build a virtual power plant <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/04/labor-offers-solar-panels-and-tesla-batteries-for-50000-south-australia-homes"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">connecting 50,000 home battery storage systems in partnership with Tesla.</A></P><P>On Monday Marshall told ABC Radio National that the plan is “not part of our agenda”, but when being sworn in as premier later that day clarified that if Labor had already entered into any contracts “we’ll be honouring them”. </P><P>Even if the plan is abandoned, Marshall has committed to proceed with his own $100m plan to subsidise the installation of 40,000 solar and home battery storage systems.</P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-3 | 3""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">Turnbull's national energy guarantee a step closer after Jay Weatherill's exit</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

Labor’s plan would be largely financed by Tesla, and benefit at least 25,100 Housing Trust homes, who would not have ownership of or have to pay for the home battery storage systems, but would enjoy a 30% cut to their energy bill.</P><P>The Liberal plan would cost taxpayers $100m in subsidies to households prepared to buy their own rooftop solar and home battery storage systems, pricing out lower socioeconomic groups.</P><P>Blowers said the main difference from an energy infrastructure perspective is a question of ambition.</P><P>“[The Liberal plan] of subsided solar home batteries seems to be subsidy for people to reduce reliance on grid, which sounds like a relatively expensive way of reducing energy prices,” he said.</P><P>“The virtual power plan is a more interesting experiment, in that those batteries almost become a combined battery that can do a range of things, including selling to the grid when prices are high.”</P><P>If Marshall unveils further plans that could impact on renewables, there is one obstacle he will have to face: SA’s Legislative Council.</P><P>Although the Liberals are expected to form a majority government out of Saturday’s state election, the SA upper house is a mixed bag. </P><P>The Liberals will have to secure the support of the majority of a likely crossbench of six, including two Greens.

<BODY><DIV class=""container""><DIV class=""content""><DIV xmlns="""" class=""index,en""><P> </P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""><B>ABSTRACT</B></FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The key sectors of the Greater Giyani Municipality (GGM) economy are driven by manufacturing, trade, catering, government, finance, transport, communications and agriculture. The goal of this study is to analyse the effect of <mark>climate change</mark> on rural-livestock farming activities in the Giyani Policing Area (GPA). The effects are described in terms of agricultural yield, livelihood and production. Apart from other general factors that impact agriculture negatively, the success of rural livestock farmers in the GPA is greatly influenced by turbulent <mark>climate change</mark> aspects. The current paper further identifies the effect of <mark>climate change</mark> (e.g. drought, temperature and rainfall) on farmers and key stakeholders while establishing how they handle challenges associated with <mark>climate change</mark> in the study district. Data were collected from 22 participants, including officials associated with Veterinary Services and Land and Infrastructure of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) in the GGM. Taking part in the Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) were officials from the DAFF-2:1, and 20:10 rural livestock farmers from Makosha and Xikukwana villages, respectively, were used for the Focus Group Discussions (FGD's). The main findings show that the rural livestock farmers in the GGM are highly vulnerable to the consequences of <mark>climate change</mark>, shown by the overall decline in livestock farming practices in the area caused by associated health and nourishment problems brought forward by <mark>climate change</mark>. The links between <mark>climate change</mark> and rural livestock farming were examined in the process of describing that droughts, excessive temperatures and heavy rainfall has a detrimental effect on rural livestock farmers in the selected areas. This paper further investigates the strategies that rural producers utilise to maintain <mark>sustainable</mark> economic viability concerning animal health, safety and nutritional requirements while preparing for unforeseen risks. In conclusion, this paper enforces the statement that the identified <mark>climate change</mark> factors do have a significant effect on rural livestock farming, despite the infrequent and varied occurrence between regions. This paper recommends that the relevant stakeholders should be encouraged to be involved in proactive and reactive activities concerning the <mark>climate change</mark>, to avoid unnecessary negative effects implicating national food security.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""><B>Keywords</B>: Agriculture, drought, rural livestock farmers, rainfall, temperature</FONT></P><P> </P><P> </P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""3""><B>1. INTRODUCTION</B></FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Different regions of the world are currently experiencing vast effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, and this trend is predicted to continue into the future. Some parts of southern Africa are predicted to have less rainfall and more wind, other parts can contrastingly have more rainfall, hotter and more humid conditions. It is foreseen that even the length of seasonal plant growth can vary in the future, which in turn affects the agro-ecosystem's production potential (<mark>Climate</mark> System Analysis Group, 2015:np).</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Previously, rural livestock producers dealt with small incidences of livestock (sheep) theft, however producers are currently (2016) faced with large scale livestock theft in the form of organised syndicates (87%), with the remainder attributed to subsistence theft (13%), largely attributable to poverty. The stock thieves are able to steal truckloads of livestock at a time and these operations are organised and supported by individuals from different socio-economic standings as described by the South African Police Service (SAPS) Research Unit (2010:np). Apart from the difficulties caused by stock theft, rural livestock farmers are additionally faced with problems due to <mark>climate change</mark>. Patterns of <mark>climate change</mark> across South African rural areas and GGM has been identified over a long period of time.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The earth's atmosphere is a mixture of gases, including 78,08% Nitrogen and 20,95% Oxygen. The rest (less than 1%) is made up of water vapour, Argon, <mark>Carbon</mark> Dioxide, Neon, Helium, Methane, Hydrogen, Nitrous Oxide and Ozone (Chetty, Isaac, Manganye, Mpondwana &amp; White, 2012:324). Some traces of Krypton, Xenon and Radone can also be found in the atmosphere. Of all the recognised gases, that contribute significantly to the 'greenhouse effect' influencing global warming and <mark>climate change</mark> are; water vapour, <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone. The increases in concentration of these greenhouse gases (GHG) has led to a rise in the average temperature on Earth defined as global warming. The global warming process contributes to an ongoing change in the earth's weather pattern referred to as <mark>climate change</mark> (Chetty, <I>et al.</I> 2012:324).</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The main objective of this paper was to identify the actual perceptions of both prominent rural livestock farmers and DAFF officials from the GPA in the Limpopo Province regarding the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, and its implications concerning rural livestock farming. Furthermore, the researcher aims to introduce a baseline in understanding the implications of <mark>climate change</mark>, and bring about reactive and proactive responses provided by rural livestock farmers and relevant stakeholders to develop a holistical approach to address this phenomenon.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""3""><B>2. THE PROBLEM FRAMEWORK</B></FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Estimating the implications of <mark>climate change</mark> on rural livestock farming, has received little attention in academic research up until now. The current study attempts to fill in the recognised research gap. In an effort to do so, the focus of this paper was based on GPA, concentrating on two villages (Makosha and Xikukwana) classified under ward 14 of GGM in the Limpopo Province. The majority of literature researched for this study predicts that the African continent will be influenced the most by <mark>climate change</mark>. Larger areas of agricultural production yields can decrease over 50% by 2020, as a result of an increasingly hotter and drier <mark>climate</mark> that threatens food security and livelihoods in most parts of Africa [UNFCCC (2008); Maponya &amp; Mpandeli (2012:5276-5277)].</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">As specified, the Limpopo Province has already experienced some of these weather events, including floods and droughts. One notable example is the floods which destroyed crops, infrastructure, and effected the harvesting period during 2000 and 2012. Due to the economic impact of these events, it is important to recognise changing rainfall distribution patterns, as well as extreme temperature trends that are likely to increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events such as drought (<mark>Climate</mark> System Analysis Group, 2015:np).</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">From October 2012 to February 2013, maximum rainfall across the Limpopo province was recorded to be below normal. Maximum mean temperatures remained cooler than the average annual previously recorded temperatures in the entire province. The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was in a strong El Niño phase for the forecast period, resulting in drought circumstances in some parts of the province negatively affecting GPA livestock farmers in the Makosha and Xilukwana villiges. Consequently, between 171 and 134 livestock were reported to have died in the Makosha and Xikukwana villages respectively, surpassing the number of reported stock theft cases for the period of 2012 (e.g. 71), 2013 (e.g. 36) and 2014 (e.g. 43). By the time this paper was drafted, the livestock farming sector was already undergoing a serious decline in production as the area was negatively influenced by drought and the shortage of available drinking water for various livestock.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The red boxes in    <A href=""/img/revistas/sajae/v45n1/04f01.jpg"">Figure 1</A> outlines the systems that focus on <I>Communities/Settlements,</I><I>Infrastructure</I> and the <I>Natural environment</I>, with the stressors    affecting those systems outlined in blue circles. The arrows point to the specific    impacts identified for the different stressors, within the different systems.    <A href=""/img/revistas/sajae/v45n1/04f01.jpg"">Figure 1</A> also identifies the relation of <mark>climate</mark>    related stressors and disaster management, to confirm the central role of <mark>climate</mark>    change in disaster management. The identification of these <mark>climate</mark> related stressors    and their impacts were correlated with the findings of the Disaster Risk Assessment    and Disaster Risk Reduction Report for Mopani District, 2012 as cited in Brodrick,    <I>et al</I>. (2014:110). The report highlights that Letaba and GGM experienced    fires, drought, dam failure, floods, deforestation, erosion, hazardous material,    epidemics, water <mark>pollution</mark>, water management, crime and extreme weather cited    as priority threats.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Communities and settlements in Letaba and GGM were identified to be prone to stress caused by change in wind patterns that results in damage to homes, loss of human life and the death of livestock. It was also noticed that many rural settlements in the area are sensitive to such damage, as they are located in wind prone areas. Moreover, infrastructure damage, due to veld fires, heavy rainfall or flooding, can disrupt service delivery, lead to the loss of livestock and can result in communities being cut-off from basic facilities such as hospitals. Some infrastructure elements are particularly sensitive to damage due to their old age and poor maintenance.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The natural environment, the resource base on which people live and from which they depend, is prone to stress from <mark>climate</mark> related factors like drought and extreme heat. Resulting impacts, such as soil erosion, a dropping water table and veld degradation and fires, depletes this resource base and requires disaster management responses. The resource depletion further requires responses that aim to restore the resource base, and that promote <mark>sustainable</mark> resource use. These findings give an indication of how people in Letaba and GGM handle disaster management while being vulnerable to a number of <mark>climate</mark> related stressors, with the disaster management sector having to develop approaches to respond.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""><A href=""/img/revistas/sajae/v45n1/04t1.jpg"">Table    1</A> indicates that <mark>climate change</mark> is real, despite the fact that many individuals    are still sceptical. More severe weather events, drought temperatures are rising,    heavy rainfall, floods, strong winds, veld fires are experienced creating major    challenges to the rural livestock farming sector.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""><A href=""/img/revistas/sajae/v45n1/04t2.jpg"">Table    2</A> illustrates the analysis of income generating activities and some of the    stressors faced in making a living from these activities. Livelihoods in Letaba    and GGM can be considered vulnerable in that they have limited financial, physical,    human, natural and social assets to deal with the stressors. Apart from the    agricultural activities, for which climatic stress plays a crucial role, all    of the stressors facing income-generating activities are non-climatic.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""3""><B>3. PROVINCIAL BACKGROUND: <mark>CLIMATE CHANGE</mark> EFFECTS AND RESPONSIVE STRATEGIES WITHIN LIMPOPO PROVINCE</B></FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Flora and fauna in the form of crops and livestock are affected by their direct environment. An organism's surroundings are identified as its environment, and can include varying conditions such as sunlight, rainfall and temperature, as well as the influence from other living organisms. The different parts of the organism's environment interact and affect the plants and animals within it negatively or positively.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">In this paper, the researchers argues that drought is a recurring problem in Limpopo Province characterised by harmful vast effects, further branding this province as an unofficial drought capital of South Africa, if not the world (selected villages under GGM included). In response to this epidemic, Mpandeli (2005) as cited in Maponya and Mpandeli, (2012:5276), mentions that in times of drought, excessive temperatures and heavy rainfall, different coping strategies should be identified, examined and shared amongst a range of role-players, including the National Agro-meteorological Committee, research institutions such as the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) and the South African Weather Service (SAWS). Limpopo's rural livestock farmers should also be encouraged to use drought-resistant cultivars during drought periods to prevent food shortages.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""><B>3.1 Monthly <mark>climate</mark> outlook </B></FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""><A href=""/img/revistas/sajae/v45n1/04t3.jpg"">Table    3</A> indicates the monthly <mark>climate</mark> outlook relating to rainfall and temperature,    seasonal rainfall (October 2012 to February 2013), and seasonal temperature    forecast (October 2012 to February 2013) in the GPA.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The following can    be deduced from <A href=""/img/revistas/sajae/v45n1/04t3.jpg"">Table 3</A> and <A href=""/img/revistas/sajae/v45n1/04t4.jpg"">Table    4</A>:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT size=""2"">■</FONT><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""> Rainfall was anticipated to be below normal from October of 2012 and this trend was also expected to extend into the New Year (2013) over Limpopo province.</FONT></P><P><FONT size=""2"">■</FONT><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""> Maximum mean temperatures were expected to remain cooler than normal in the entire province.</FONT></P><P><FONT size=""2"">■</FONT><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""> ENSO was currently in an El Niño phase and was predicted to persist in ENSO phase for the forecast period.</FONT></P><P><FONT size=""2"">■</FONT><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""> Farmers were advised to prioritise drought tolerant cultivars. In addition, farmers were encouraged to utilise seven-day weather forecasts for short-term planning (DAFF, Limpopo Provincial Government, Republic of South Africa, 2012:2-7).</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P> </P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""3""><B>4. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY</B></FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">According to Bezuidenhout (2011:48), a research design is the blueprint, procedure or plan of action used to analyse a chosen topic. Mouton (2001:55) also promotes that a research design is &quot;a plan of how one intends conducting the research, by focusing on the end product&quot;. This framework correlates with the guideline used for writing this paper. A qualitative research approach was used in the current study. The validation of this approach is reinforced by White (2002:81), who states that qualitative research is more concerned with understanding social phenomena from the perspective of the participants. This takes place through the researchers' participation in the daily life activities of those involved in the research and thus corresponds with the main objective of this paper.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Purposive sampling was adopted in this paper to ensure that participants were composed out of the most characteristic and representative attributes of the population while making judgements about the prior selection criteria. This type of sampling is regarded as the most important type of non-probability sampling. While utilising this method, researchers rely on their experience, ingenuity and/or previous research findings to deliberately obtain units of analysis in such a manner that the sample they obtain may be regarded as being representative of the relevant population (Welman, Kruger &amp; Mitchell, 2005:69). In selecting settings and behaviour, the researcher used his own discretion to select both public and private methods. Public methods are non-secretive, and this was directed towards the FGDs.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">GGM has a population size of 244217 (by the time of writing this paper), which makes it the second largest municipality in terms of population contribution (22%) in the Mopani District. According to the 2011 Census, 99,5% of the population are black Africans, with the other population groups making up the remaining 0,5% with a 0,14% growth rate. The estimated population for Makosha village was 4 818 with 1 218 livestock farmers, while the Xikukwana village comprised of 2 618 people with a total of 658 livestock farmers. When this paper was finalised, an overall 35.9% of the GPA population owned various livestock and 60.7% of households practiced livestock farming. Livestock farming is regarded as income generating activities in the GGM, comprising of small-scale crop and livestock farming (e.g. beans, potatoes, green pepper, tomatoes, banana, apples, cattle, pigs, chickens, goats, commercial farming-crop farming, and livestock farming of poultry) (Statistics South Africa, 2014 &amp; 2015:np).</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Livestock farming contributes significantly to the livelihoods of people living in the rural areas of developing countries (De Haan, Van Veen, Brandenburg, Gauthier, Le Gal, Mearns &amp; Simeon, 2001:np). South Africa is no different, especially the GPA. Amongst various challenges that are faced by South African livestock farmers, adaptation to <mark>climate change</mark> remains particularly problematic. In addition, rural livestock farmers are commonly affected by their surrounding environment.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The population    used for the paper in question consisted of prominent livestock farmers and    DAFF officials in the GGM. In connection with this statement, the sample was    purposively selected from the inner city of GGM and in particular two villages    outside the city centre. The sample included 22 participants-2:1. Veterinary    Services and Land and Infrastructure officials from DAFF and 20:10 participants    in the group consisted of 20:10 prominent rural livestock farmers from the respective    villages (Makosha and Xikukwana). The selected sample were viewed by the researcher    as the most accurate representative for the GPA communities while relying on    the participants' experiences of <mark>climate change</mark>.</FONT></P><P> </P><P align=""center""><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""><A href=""/img/revistas/sajae/v45n1/04t5.jpg"">Table    5</A></FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Paterniti (2012:np) views FGDs as a small group discussion guided by a set of research questions that explore attitudes, values, and behaviours, emphasising a particular topic or event and a homogenous yet diverse group led by a trained discussion leader and KII's. The purpose of a KII is to collect information from a wide range of people, including community leaders, professionals, or residents who have first-hand knowledge about the community.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">These community experts, with their particular knowledge and understanding, can provide insight into the nature of problems and give recommendations for solutions, University of California, Los Angeles [UCLA] Centre for Health Policy Research (2015:np). The fieldwork was conducted from 5 October 2012 to 5 February 2013 in the GPA with the adoption of FGDs and KII's interviewing methods. This was coupled with unstructured questions asked to the participants as a mode of data collection for this paper. The researcher launched explorative investigation to conduct pre-testing of the interview schedule, in support of the research problem and objectives of this paper. Welman, <I>et al</I>. (2005:201) explain that this type of interviewing helps to clarify concepts and problems and allows the establishment of a list of possible answers and solutions which, in turn, facilitates the construction of further questions, the elimination of superfluous questions, and the reformulation of ambiguous ones. However, it is evident that <mark>climate</mark> outlook may be interpreted in different ways, therefore, participants were given the opportunity to express themselves freely about their knowledge and beliefs about the concept under discussion.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Two FGD's (20:10) were conducted with prominent rural livestock farmers from selected villages (Makosha and Xikukwana). The interview guide to the participants examined the trends of <mark>climate change</mark>, including factors such as temperature, rainfall and drought over time, which may result in livestock fatalities basing more conclusion on the condition of drinking troughs, earth dams, reservoirs, grazing camps and livestock, and the number of livestock that died as a result of extreme temperatures, excessive seasonal rainfall and drought in the GPA.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Two KII's and two FGD's were conducted in GPA, with the participants drawn from rural areas and the inner city:</FONT></P><UL type=""disc""><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">An inner-city area (DAFF officials KIIs), and</FONT></P></LI><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Rural areas outside the inner city (FGDs).</FONT></P></LI></UL><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The participants were made available and requested to participate in the research. Gender, age, educational background and economic differentiation did not play a role in this regard. All 22 participants were Tsonga speaking. Furthermore, population validity was used in this research since it was very difficult and practically impossible to obtain the relevant information from the entire population within the targeted locations of the current study. Therefore, the targeted individuals were native residents of GGM and DAFF officials, and were mainly rural livestock farmers with different socio-economic status.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">For this paper, the collected data was analysed through the use of a voice recorder and note taking while conducting the said FGD and KII's. The KII's and FGD's were conducted with the identified target population of this study in the GPA. By analysing the data derived from these interviews, the researcher obtained an overall picture of the perceptions of the participants on the subject matter. Qualitative findings gained from the KII's and FGD's enabled the researcher to present findings of this paper in a meaningful context. The solicited data was analysed according to the thematic method. In connection to this statement; the researcher further strived to link concepts to each other in terms of a sequence, as oppositional sets or as sets of similar categories that will eventually be interweaved into theoretical statements, as expressed by Neuman (1997:421).</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">De Vos, Strydom, Fouche and Delport (2005:339) further elaborate that the salient grounded categories of meaning held by participants in the settings. This method assisted in compiling data into themes, sub-themes and categories. The participants of this paper were given details of the intended paper and offered an opportunity to contribute their views in person. Moreover, it was explained to the participants that this paper was exploratory in nature. The same sets of questions were asked to all the selected participants. The results obtained were generalised to the entire population. The participants were further asked for their views on the effects of <mark>climate</mark> on rural livestock farmers, and to indicate what kind of modifications might be introduced to overcome the challenges in responding to predicted change in <mark>climate</mark>. They were reassured that no individual sources would be revealed, and that a summary of the report would be made available to them on conclusion of the study.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""3""><B>5. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS</B></FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""><B>5.1 Paper finding 1: Turbulent <mark>climate change</mark></B></FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Variable temperatures and excessive seasonal rainfall are not unique to the Limpopo province, which is also branded as a drought prone province. As a result, the province has experienced reduced available grazing and water availability for livestock and irrigation, which has negatively impacted the agricultural sector. Of all South African provinces, Limpopo was the worst affected by drought in the past eight years (2004-2012), where dams were only 50% full, compared with 84% in the late nineties. The agricultural sector is seen as an important source of livelihood for Limpopo, especially in rural areas. Extreme <mark>climate change</mark>s make it difficult for livestock farmers to cope with all the various financial implications/ challenges? It is quite disturbing that in the Makosha and Xikukwana villages, livestock farmers were forced to sell their livestock in the year 2012 and 2013 respectively due to the identified <mark>climate change</mark> conditions. This presents a serious challenge for agriculture activities resulting in food scarcity, not only in the province, but also in all rural communities across South Africa.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">An interview was held with an affected livestock farmer residing at Makuleke Village in Malamulele, under Vhembe district on the 6H30-7H00 current affairs (Munghana Lonene FM, Friday, 12/10/2012). At the time of the interview, 30 cows of his stock were dead. He further mentioned that there was no grazing pasture, water or water tank. When the call was made he had been in the veld looking for food and water for the remaining cattle. Regarding available water sources, he said that the wells and dams were also dry. In response, the Provincial Head of DAFF for Limpopo province, Mr. Mortimer Mannya, was asked the following question by the current affairs presenter during the same interview: <I>&quot;Many areas in Limpopo province are hard hit by drought leading to the death of livestock, thus, what are the hints in place to combat further mortalities?&quot;</I> In responding to the posed question, Mr Mannya mentioned that areas in Limpopo Province are exposed to very harsh weather and, in essence, there are many high-risk areas. He went on to say that the livestock farmers should be given early warnings of exposure that they can expect over a particular period of time.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The second question was: <I>&quot;Is there any advice you can give to livestock farmers in order for them to limit their losses?&quot; </I>This is what he said:</FONT></P><UL type=""disc""><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">They must sell their livestock early when approaching drought seasons;</FONT></P></LI><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">They should register as livestock farmers with the veterinary service official in order to be given fodder in desperate times like these; and</FONT></P></LI><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">They should note that the supply of fodder is not adequate, however, the Provincial Disaster Management say they are doing the best they can to meet the demand.</FONT></P></LI></UL><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Within five days after the initial interview, another interview was conducted with Mr. Chauke, residing at Makuleke village in Malamulele, under Vhembe district by the radio station Munghana Lonene FM, 2012, on the 9H00 evening news. This producer mentioned that he lost 134 cows due to the drought, and went on to state that his farming business is suffering due to the livestock losses. He also mentioned that at Makuleke Block H, a further 171 cows were dead. He then blamed the DAFF for not helping them with anything and said that they do not know who to turn to. He concluded by saying that &quot;even where I am standing right now, some of my livestock has collapsed.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Based on the responses from the participants, it is clear that beyond the initiatives that revolve around educating, empowering and involving the livestock community as well as the general public to prevent and protect their livestock against any challenges, drought remains problematic in the area.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""><B>5.2 Paper finding 2: Severe livestock mortalities </B></FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">During the FGD's, one of the participants mentioned that 30 cows of his stock died due to the drought. Overall, 305 livestock died in Makosha and Xikukwana villages collectively for the period of October 2012-February 2013. The Provincial Disaster Management does not seem to meet the demands in terms of fodder supply in the area.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The DAFF officials indicated that the number of livestock had died because of drought. They mentioned that the GGM is already becoming increasingly prone to periodic water and grass shortages in the grazing camps and irrigation scheme, which threaten necessary developments and even the sustainability of existing industry and agriculture. This phenomenon affects the farmers drastically in the following ways:</FONT></P><UL type=""disc""><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""><B>Financial        implications:</B> Drought condition was still persisting, in August 2012,        a delivery schedule for dry fodder for 2012-2013 financial years was received        for Mopani District distributions, while the DAFF was still waiting for        the service provider on the other hand. In addition, drought, excessive        temperatures and rainfall in the GPA (<A href=""/img/revistas/sajae/v45n1/04t6.jpg"">Table 6</A>)        affected the following numbers of livestock.</FONT></P></LI></UL><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">In summation, by the time of conducting the fieldwork, approximately 719 livestock were reported dead resulting from drought conditions from different villages around GGM. The researcher personally visited the traditional leader of each village to compile the statistics above. It was clearly indicated by the participants and the traditional leaders, in isolation from the participants, of this paper that the experienced <mark>climate change</mark> period was not associated with witchcraft connotations at all costs. The DAFF participants concluded by stating that no marketing information was available, but sales were done through <I>Makhoma</I> meat butchery in the GGM, and fodder is urgently needed, the participant concluded.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""><B>5.3 Paper findings 3: Unfavourable <mark>climate change</mark> conditions </B></FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The veld condition was deteriorated and disease outbreak on livestock resulting in mortalities was witnessed. Dam water was used for both livestock and human consumption, and some of the earth dams were silted, damaged or empty. A large number of livestock died due to the effect of the drought. It was also mentioned by the participant that the GGM is already becoming increasingly prone to periodic water and grass shortages in the grazing camps and irrigation schemes. These shortcomings threaten necessary developments and even the sustainability of existing industry and agriculture.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">During the KII with DAFF officials, it was revealed that the <mark>climate</mark> conditions around GGM received 15-millimetre rainfall in September 2012 and the daily temperature ranged between a minimum of 15ºC and a maximum of 36ºC. The participant went on to mention that in line with veld and livestock conditions, the following was indicated as the most problematic areas for livestock farming in the area (e.g. not in order of importance):</FONT></P><UL type=""disc""><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The veld condition has deteriorated, and</FONT></P></LI><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Livestock disease outbreak and livestock mortalities reported.</FONT></P></LI></UL><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">In general, grazing conditions were very bad and fodder supplements were urgently needed. The participant further cited the following examples below:</FONT></P><UL type=""disc""><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">680 livestock farmers applied for fodder at Muyexe depot, and</FONT></P></LI><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">833 livestock farmers applied for fodder at GGM depot.</FONT></P></LI></UL><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The aforementioned    clearly indicates that the demand for the dry fodder was of high demand during    this time (e.g. 15 13 total application received). The FGD's revealed that the    demand and supply was not meeting the producer's needs. However, the acknowledgement    of good work by the DAFF officials was highly cited. They indicated that there    are many livestock farmers in the area in anticipation of feed supply. Thus,    the DAFF faced the shortfall in supplying them with additional feed. It is about    time for the participants to come up with alternative ways of responding to    <mark>climate change</mark>. With not much reliance placed on the local DAFF for the preservation    of their livestock, the local DAFF on the other hand should educate the livestock    farmers about the responsive ways to <mark>climate change</mark> to enhance their relations    with the livestock farmers across GPA communities for future purposes. The DAFF    participants further mentioned that dams are used for both livestock and human    consumption and some of the earth dams are silted, damaged and empty. They were    in need of repair, cleaning and dredging. <A href=""/img/revistas/sajae/v45n1/04t7.jpg"">Table 7</A>    indicates the condition of dams in the GGM.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">In summation, the DAFF participants recommended that due to the shortage of stock watering, additional bore holes and earth dams are needed to avoid the current situation and future livestock mortalities owing to drought.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""3""><B>6. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS</B></FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">In order to prevent further global warming and its effects, we need to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We can do this by reducing greenhouse gas emissions (e.g. change to renewable forms of energy, save energy, recycle waste, use public transport and use clean technologies), increasing <mark>carbon</mark> sinks (e.g. protecting existing trees and forestry and plant new trees), working with other countries of the world (e.g. all the countries needs to work together to bring greenhouse gas emissions under control and prevent further <mark>climate change</mark> as a global problem such as <mark>climate change</mark> needs a global solution) and reducing our own <mark>carbon</mark> footprint (e.g. a measure of the total greenhouse gas emissions through the activities of a country, an organisation or a person in one year -electricity usage-activities such as heating, lighting and electrical appliances, transport for travelling purposes, waste production-waste produced, recycling and compost waste and fires-wood and fossil fuels such as coal burned for cooking or heating) as described by De Fontaine, Freedman, Marchant, Mckay, Simenson, Van der Merwe and Webb (2012:334-336).</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""><mark>Climate change</mark> predictions of constant change in temperatures, excessive seasonal rainfalls and drought conditions in the GPA of GGM are beyond control of rural livestock farmers. With acknowledging that weather and <mark>climate</mark> patterns play a significant role in livestock farming, <mark>climate change</mark> is identified as the affect varying weather conditions have on rural livestock farmers. Therefore, the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on rural livestock farming depends on many associated factors that can be detrimental to the economic viability and sustainability of livestock production. It suggests that agriculture can be a major contributor to the local economy, if the climatic conditions are favourable. Agriculture has been the backbone of the Giyani local economy; therefore, the local municipality should fast track arable land and irrigation schemes.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">It is suggested that the strategies and guidelines outlined are employed by rural livestock farmers to respond to the effects and implications caused by unfavourable <mark>climate</mark> conditions in the GPA of G MM, and should include the following:</FONT></P><UL type=""disc""><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Close collaboration, interaction and information exchange between relevant role-players within GPA (e.g. more especially the DAFF) to respond to turbulent <mark>climate change</mark>. Rural livestock farmers should learn more about how they can adapt to <mark>climate change</mark> impacts. Working in line with Animal Identification Act 6 of 2002, regulation 11 to receive the necessary aid in dry fodder supply.</FONT></P></LI><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Promoting greater awareness within GPA in understanding the risks and actions that can instigate the behaviours of relevant stakeholders and enable livestock protection and preservation against <mark>climate change</mark>. Furthermore, they should be encouraged to sell mature, marketable animals to help prevent overstocking and minimise livestock mortalities during excessive <mark>climate change</mark> periods.</FONT></P></LI><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">To respond to <mark>climate change</mark> conditions. Enhanced nutritional value of dry grazing should be exercised. This is done by following correct farming practices to keep stocking rates in balance through carrying capacity, to ensure livestock good conditions and provide lots of drinking points to anticipate drought and change in temperatures.</FONT></P></LI><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Enhanced nutritional value of dry grazing feed fields with links should be improved. Links should (in most cases) provide phosphorous, urea (to help the breakdown of dry vegetation and grazing fields for livestock), salt and molasses (e.g. deficiencies differ according to vegetation composition <mark>climate</mark> and analysis of vegetation samples can benefit the decision for supplement composition).</FONT></P></LI><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Ensuring that Kyoto Protocol based on agreement made by 170 countries reduce greenhouse gases that cause <mark>climate change</mark> and Conference of the Parties [COP](e.g. COP17) resolutions (e.g. details of the Bali Action Plan, goals for reducing GHGs emissions by 2050, time frames for the peaking of GHG's, a second commitment term for the Kyoto Protocol and development of a Green <mark>Climate</mark> Fund) as suggested in 2011, at COP 17, Durban, South Africa are adhered to by the parties involved during yearly meetings to assess progress in dealing with <mark>climate change</mark>.</FONT></P></LI><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">More empirical research needed for <mark>climate change</mark> on livestock farming. Despite the importance of livestock to poor people and the magnitude of the changes that are likely to befall livestock systems, the inter-section of <mark>climate change</mark> and livestock in developing countries (e.g. South Africa included) is a relatively neglected research area (Thornton, Van de Steeg, Notenbaert &amp; Herrero, 2009:113).</FONT></P></LI><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The need for a mix of technological, policy and institutional <mark>innovation</mark>s is required. It is emphasised that on the technology side, improvements should be linked to a combination of feed and nutrition, genetics and breeding, health and environmental management options, with different combinations appropriate to different systems (Thornton, <I>et al</I>. 2009:113).</FONT></P></LI><LI><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">With <mark>climate change</mark>, significant changes in improving physical and biological systems have already occurred on all continents and in most oceans (e.g. South Africa should follow the lead) and most of these changes are in the direction expected with warming temperature (e.g. this can further help the livestock farmers going forward) (Rosenzweig, <I>et al</I>. 2008 as cited in Thornton, <I>et al</I>. 2009:113).</FONT></P></LI></UL><P> </P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""3""><B>REFERENCES</B></FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">BEZUIDENHOUT, C. 2011. <I>Southern African perspectives on fundamentals criminology</I>.

Issue No.49/50  (DECEMBER 2016)</P><P><STRONG>The crises in steel and mining and what they mean for the South African economy</STRONG></P><P>The core of the South African economy has been hit by significant crises in the steel industry and across mining. Commodity prices have been in a state of collapse for the last five years, following the commodity boom that preceded the slump.</P><P>Both crises reflect the madness of the market, and of production being dependent on global market forces. Both have dire consequences for economic development in South Africa – critically jobs – and suggest more deindustrialisation is likely, instead of less. In steel, the international price has plummeted to the lowest in over a decade – about a 45% drop over the course of 2015, from $500 a tonne to about $280 a tonne. This drop in price is a consequence of “oversupply”.</P><P>The price of iron ore and coking coal – the key inputs in the production of steel – have also halved.</P><P>This crisis has not affected South Africa alone. It is a global crisis. Jobs and plants are threatened with closure in Britain, and the Conservative government there considered the renationalisation of the industry, albeit briefly.</P><P>The oversupply is a result of how the steel industry has been caught up in China’s market crash.</P><P>China produces about half of the 1.6 billion tonnes of steel made each year. The state subsidises steel production, sustaining domestic production. As the economy has slowed down, a greater part of Chinese steel has been exported. This has led many to argue that China has been dumping steel on the global market, producing a crisis for other producers and threatening mass steel closures. The boom in cheap Chinese exports is what has caused the plummeting of the price.</P><P>In South Africa, the industry came close to complete collapse, forcing the government to impose a 10% tariff on imported steel in a last ditch effort to save the industry.</P><P>But is the industry worth saving? The answer to that question must be yes. Steel is the most important feedstock into industrial development. It is second only to oil in importance. But it is hardly produced in Africa at all. Only South Africa and Egypt produce steel in any quantity on the whole continent. Construction and the auto industry are big sources of demand but public transport, roads and railways, housing, irrigation schemes, hospitals, schools, and so forth all need steel. It’s a dirty, <mark>carbon</mark> intensive industry, though producers could be far cleaner than they presently are. But there are no substitutes for steel, unlike in the energy sector where coal can be replaced by renewable energy sources.</P><P><STRONG>Commodity price collapse</STRONG></P><P>The crisis in mining has followed the global collapse of commodity prices from their peak in 2011. The last five years has been disastrous, though mining is still South Africa’s biggest foreign currency earner.</P><P>The collapse of commodity prices, sometimes by over 50%, has led to the restructuring of many mining houses, the selling off of assets, and, of course, job losses. Anglo and Lonmin in particular have seen major job losses. Platinum has had six years of crisis. Iron ore and manganese have seen the biggest price changes. Coal export prices have halved, and nickel and gold, oil and copper have been hit hard too.</P><P>Prices picked up a little at the start of 2016 from their 25 year low, but remain unstable. Many commodities are profitable, just not profitable enough, with firms facing “excess production capacity.” The mining crisis has hit investments in infrastructure too, as much infrastructure development is tailored to the global minerals sector. In South Africa the government’s infrastructure development plans now seem irrationally optimistic.</P><P>However, executive pay in mining continues to grow. For example, Nick Holland of Gold Fields received R40 million in 2015 (8.8% up on the previous year) whilst dividends fell by 19% in the same period. AngloGold’s CEO Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan got R26 million, 28% up on the year before.</P><P><STRONG>Consequences of the crisis</STRONG></P><P>The crisis means conflicts over jobs, not only between companies and workers but between workers, and between workers and the unemployed. This accompanies the already deep tensions between the mines and the communities of the mining areas, starved of resources like water and basic public services.</P><P>This is not just in South Africa but across all the many mining-dependent economies in Africa.</P><P>South Africa does face a specific problem, though. Many of the stronger sections of manufacturing developed to supply machinery and equipment, critical inputs into the mining sector. So they are dependent on mining for demand. A crisis in mining thus quickly becomes a crisis for manufacturing sectors like metals and metal products.</P><P>So the mining and the steel crises are crises in the core of the economy, in the core of what Ben Fine and Zavareh Rustomjee have called the “Minerals-Energy Complex”.</P><P><STRONG>Loss of state-owned steel</STRONG></P><P>The South African state established the Iron and Steel Industrial Corporation, ISCOR , in 1928. Its purpose was to use South Africa’s iron ore to ensure a supply of cheap steel to industry and to develop industrialisation and generate employment (for whites.) It was developed alongside Eskom’s provision of cheap coal-based electricity to the mines and other industry, and later SASOL ’s oil from coal and polymers for plastics. They formed a capital-intensive core of the economy. State-owned enterprises played a key role. They were intertwined with the mining industry, and they rested on cheap, black labour.</P><P>ISCOR was privatised in 1989, one of the cruel last acts of the apartheid regime. It eventually became part of ArcelorMittal – the biggest steel producer in the world. There was a state-owned steel industry which could now be used to help diversify industry and the economy generally, to generate jobs for the black majority, and to help in meeting basic needs (houses, hospitals, school etc.). Instead, we have a private monopoly which hits downstream industries by charging them import parity prices. They add on transport costs so that local buyers pay the same price for steel produced locally as the price they would pay if it came from oversees. This can add as much as 35% above international prices, once these imaginary transport costs have been added on. On top of this, the South African operations of ArcelorMittal were used to subsidise its operations elsewhere in the world.</P><P>So the once-nationalized industry in the MEC core of the economy became a barrier to industrial development in the post-apartheid era by squeezing downstream manufacturing. Now it needs to be rescued because of the global crisis! Across the post-apartheid period, what we see is that there was no diversification out of the MEC core of minerals and energy or building up a labour intensive manufacturing sectors. Instead, the labour intensive sectors were first hit by trade liberalisation, and now the MEC core itself is being hit by de-industrialisation.</P><P><STRONG>Renationalise steel industry</STRONG></P><P>Global oversupp ly of steel is likely to continue. The impact on the South African economy will continue to be dire. And yet South Africa has high grade iron ore, it has steel making knowledge and capacities, there is vast need for the industries’ products, priced radically differently from how they have been over the last 20 years. And whilst the price of electricity is no longer as cheap as it was, electricity remains relatively cheap. This surely points to the necessity for a state steel company and the renationalisation of the steel industry.</P><P>Likewise, to rebuild the industrial base of the economy, we should be debating renationalising SASOL and polymer production. They are the basis of key inputs into plastic goods. Like ArcelorMittal, SASOL has been abusing its monopoly position with monopoly prices that hit downstream industries. And surely now is the time to revisit the nationalisation of the mines debate. Think how cheap it would be, given the erosion in the value of the mining companies. What we can be sure of is this: the further de-industrialisation of the core of the South African economy helps no one.</P><P>Sam Ashman is Associate Professor in the Department of Economics and Econometrics at the University of Johannesburg.
