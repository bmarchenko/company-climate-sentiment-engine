Regulations basically put a price on emitting <mark>carbon</mark>, making it more expensive to burn fossil fuels. &quot;The question to ask is, in a world where <mark>climate change</mark> is leading regulations, what happens to the estimated value of the company's assets, and therefore the worth of that company,&quot; says Bevis Longstreth, a former SEC commissioner. This is especially important for companies who rely on public investors.</P><P class=""paywall"">Since at least the late 1980s, Exxon has sold its stock based on two claims: 1) <mark>Climate change</mark> is not real; and, 2) Even if it were, governments would balk at the huge costs associated with transitioning to clean energy economies. But in 2015, <EM>Inside <mark>Climate</mark> News</EM> reported that Exxon didn't actually believe that first claim. That investigation showed how the company's <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/15092015/Exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming"" target=""_blank"">own research established the links between greenhouse gas emissions and <mark>climate change</mark> back in the 1970s</A>. Then, beginning in the late 1980s, Exxon actively worked against domestic and international efforts to introduce <mark>climate change</mark>-fighting regulations. By extension, it was—allegedly—misleading its own investors about how <mark>climate change</mark> would affect their returns.</P><P class=""paywall"">The SEC is just the latest government agency to target Exxon for investor fraud. New York's attorney general launched an investigation last September, and has since been joined by 19 other attorneys general. In March, the Department of Justice <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/02032016/justice-department-refers-exxon-investigation-request-fbi-<mark>climate</mark>-change-research-denial"" target=""_blank"">referred a congressional request for an investigation into Exxon to the FBI</A>.</P><P class=""paywall"">So what are they all looking for? Well, first of all, this is more broad than just <mark>climate</mark> investigations. Exxon does not publicly record how it values its own oil reserves during market fluctuations. The current oil market, for instance, is <A href=""http://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart"" target=""_blank"">oh-so-timidly rebounding from a historic bottoming out</A>, which was driven largely by a natural gas boom. But through that dip, Exxon has continued to invest in high-cost oil exploration.</P><P class=""paywall"">&quot;Then the question arises of corporate waste. This becomes of paramount interest to your investors, if you are spending $80 or so per barrel to explore for new oil, and the market is only paying $40 per barrel. In short, your stock is overvalued,&quot; says Longstreth. Especially if the oil price is not expected to recover—which is a reasonable assumption, given that last year 185 countries agreed to emit net zero <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by 2050. &quot;If the world's economy is weaned off oil by 2050, what happens to the value of those reserves you spent all that money accumulating? Do they have any value anymore&quot; says Longstreth.</P><P class=""paywall"">To figure that out, the SEC will dive into Exxon's accounting records, looking for evidence that it was overvaluing its oil reserves. The investigators will also likely try to figure out how Exxon calculated the effects of various government emissions regulations on its profits. &quot;They will probably ask the following questions: What would be the impact on Exxon's assets if emissions were priced at $20 a ton, $40 a ton, $60 a ton,&quot; says Bob Litterman, former head of risk management for Goldman Sachs. &quot;That's the kind of information any investor would want to learn about a company operating in the fossil fuel industry.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">The mere fact that the normally pussyfooted SEC is doing a formal investigation is big news. Launching one requires a majority vote from the SEC commissioners. &quot;They wouldn't launch a formal investigation without something close to probable cause that these rules had been violated, and if Exxon violated them the SEC has no option but to proceed with some form of enforcement,&quot; says Longstreth. In the most extreme circumstance, Longstreth says the SEC could make Exxon liable for paying out damages to anyone who overbought, or undersold, stock during whatever time frame the SEC deems the company culpable.</P><P class=""paywall"">But that's not likely, given Exxon's litigious nature, and the SEC's track record with bringing corporate mustache-twirlers to justice. More realistically, they might send an impartial accountant to monitor Exxon's books for a few years. That alone would probably force more active <mark>climate change</mark> disclosures from other fossil fuel companies (most of whom are doing much better in that regard than Exxon). &quot;But the fact that the SEC is raising the <mark>carbon</mark> cost question is deeply significant,&quot; says Longstreth. Other companies could be driven to release more accurate accounts of how <mark>climate change</mark> affects their business, and that cost would become transparent in their stock prices. And that's how you slay a giant.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The 1999 acquisition of Mobil by Exxon brought together two of the former portions of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Trust that each had racked up a long string of environmental violations and other controversies. <SPAN style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 1.5em;"">Environmental groups have targeted the company for supporting <mark>climate change</mark> denial, and now state attorneys general are investigating whether the company for decades deliberately concealed its knowledge of <mark>climate</mark> dangers.</SPAN><SPAN style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 1.5em;""> </SPAN></P><P> </P><P><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Environment and Product Safety</SPAN></P><P>Exxon was never a particularly &quot;green&quot; company, but an event on March 24, 1989 gave it a prominent place in the environmental rogues gallery. On that day its supertanker Valdez went aground off the coast of Alaska and spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into the Prince William Sound, polluting more than 700 miles of shoreline. Although much of the guilt was laid to the captain of the vessel, who was intoxicated and away from his post at the time of the accident, Exxon was also blamed. Among the charges were that the company did not act quickly enough in dealing with the spill and that it did not adequately cooperate with state and federal officials.</P><P>A coalition of environmental groups launched a boycott of Exxon and urged customers to return their credit cards to the company. They also called on the oil giant to roll back recent gasoline price increases, to pay for the clean-up, and to establish a $1 billion trust fund for protecting endangered areas of Alaska. When institutional investors pressured the company to appoint an environmentalist to its board of directors, Exxon named John H. Steele of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution—a choice that was not entirely satisfactory to many environmental groups. Exxon also vowed to spend some $1.3 billion for the clean-up.</P><P>Nonetheless, in February 1990 the company was indicted by a federal grand jury on criminal felony and misdemeanor charges. The following year, Exxon agreed to settle the case by pleading guilty to one charge and paying a fine of $100 million. The civil cases were another matter. An initial $900 million <A href=""http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/valdez/02.html"">settlement</A> fell apart. After several years of legal maneuvering, in September 1994 a federal jury <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/17/us/exxon-is-ordered-to-pay-5-billion-for-alaska-spill.html"">ordered</A> Exxon to pay $5 billion in punitive damages. There was an uproar after it came to light that Exxon had made deals with seafood processors that in effect let the company recoup some of the damages it would pay. The judge in the case, H. Russel Holland, <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/14/business/exxon-is-accused-of-astonishing-ruse-in-oil-spill-trial.html"">said</A> Exxon was engaged in “an astonishing ruse.”</P><P>Exxon delayed as long as possible in paying any of the damages by pursuing a protracted appeals process. In 2001 it got a federal appeals court to rule that the punitive damage award was punitive, prompting the judge in the case to <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/07/us/award-in-exxon-valdez-oil-spill-cut-from-5-billion-to-4-billion.html"">reduce</A> the amount to $4 billion. That amount was also <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/23/us/court-is-ordered-to-reconsider-award-in-exxon-valdez-spill.html"">rejected</A> by the appeals court, but rather than giving in, Judge Holland <A href=""http://www.lieffcabraser.com/news/594/judge-says-exxon-owes-6-75-billion-for-valdez-appeal-promised-as-suit-over-89-spill-drags-on"">hiked</A> the damage award to $6.75 billion. In 2008 the case reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/washington/26punitive.html"">slashed</A> the punitive damage award to about $500 million, or about the same as the compensatory damages that had been imposed.   </P><P>While the Exxon Valdez dispute played out, Exxon faced other environmental controversies.</P><P>In December 1989 an explosion at its Baton Rouge, Louisiana refinery was so powerful that debris was spread for miles; two men were killed in the incident. On January 1, 1990 a cracked underwater pipeline at the company's Bayway Refinery in New Jersey leaked some 600,000 gallons of heating oil into part of New York harbor. That leak continued for six hours as operators doubted the validity of an alarm that had sounded. The company settled criminal and civil charges brought in connection with the leak by agreeing to fund $15 million in environmental initiatives. In 1992 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fined Exxon $178,000 for reporting violations at Bayway. The following year the company <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/10/business/company-news-exxon-to-pay-<mark>pollution</mark>-fines-on-refinery-it-sold.html"">agreed</A> to pay another $1 million to New Jersey officials in connection with Bayway violations before selling the facility to Tosco Corp.</P><P>In 1996 an estimated 2,000 gallons of crude oil <A href=""http://articles.latimes.com/1996-05-03/news/mn-55_1_santa-barbara-channel"">spilled</A> into Santa Barbara Channel off southern California from an Exxon oil platform.</P><P>In February 1998 the U.S. Justice Department, acting on behalf of the EPA, sued Exxon USA for violations of the Clean Air Act and demanded up to $4.7 million in fines.</P><P>In August 1998 Exxon and two other oil companies <A href=""http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/27/news/mn-17086"">agreed</A> to pay $4.8 million to settle a lawsuit claiming that the firms had discharged unacceptable levels of toxic selenium into San Francisco Bay.</P><P>Prior to its merger with Exxon, Mobil had its own environmental compliance problems. For example, in 1989 the company was sued by the city of Torrance, California because of leaks of hydrofluoric acid and other health and safety problems at the company's refinery in that city. The suit, calling the facility a public nuisance, cited numerous instances of worker injury and death at the refinery as well as an instance in which fumes from the plant hospitalized eight students and two teachers at a nearby school. The city later filed criminal charges against the company and two of its managers in connection with a 1988 explosion at the refinery that killed one person and burned several others. In 1990 Mobil and the city reached a settlement of the public nuisance suit in which the company agreed to phase out or reformulate the use of hydrofluoric acid.</P><P>In 1989 the state of Massachusetts penalized Mobil for failing to report the discovery of a leaking gasoline tank at one of its service stations by requiring the company to take out newspaper advertisements urging other gasoline companies to comply with environmental laws and to upgrade their storage facilities. </P><P>Also in 1989, Mobil pleaded no contest to criminal charges in California relating to pipeline ruptures the year before that had spilled more than 130,000 gallons of crude oil, much of it into the Los Angeles River and the city's sewer system.</P><P>In 1990 Mobil finally began to take action to deal with an environmental hazard that had existed for decades. The problem was a veritable underground lake of petroleum resulting from years of leaks from storage tanks and pipelines at the company's facility in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, New York. After years of resisting taking responsibility for the millions of gallons of oil, Mobil signed a consent order that required it to clean up the mess. </P><P>Mobil came under criticism for its attempt to portray its Hefty plastic trash bags as friendly to the environment. In 1990 half a dozen states filed lawsuits against the company, charging it with deceptive advertising for calling the bags biodegradable. New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams called the company's claims for Hefty “green-collar fraud.” Mobil settled the suits in 1991 by agreeing to end the claims about biodegradability and to pay each of the states $25,000. </P><P>In 1991 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed a penalty of $575,000 against Mobil's facility in Paulsboro, New Jersey for failure to report several accidental releases of hazardous substances.</P><P>Exxon and Mobil were both among the ten major oil companies cited by the EPA in 1991 for discharging contaminated fluids from service stations into or directly above underground sources for drinking water. Each agreed to pay a fine of $125,000 and to clean up the conditions by the end of 1993.</P><P>In 2001 Exxon Mobil <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/14/nyregion/exxonmobil-to-pay-11.2-million-for-lying-about-poison-waste.html"">agreed</A> to pay $11.2 million to settle a 1990s federal case in which Mobil was accused of dumping waste with carcinogenic benzene into the Arthur Kill waterway of Staten Island in New York City—and then lying about its actions.</P><P>As concern about <mark>climate change</mark> escalated in the 1990s, Exxon was targeted for its attempts to downplay the crisis. In October 1997, for example, CEO Lee Raymond gave a speech to the 15th World Petroleum Congress in which he declared that there were no feasible alternatives to fossil fuels, so that “the use of fossil fuels is essential both for economic growth and for the elimination of poverty, which is itself the worst polluter.” Raymond went on to assert that “most of the greenhouse effect comes from natural sources, especially water vapor.”</P><P>In 2000 environmental and religious shareholder activists groups launched Campaign ExxonMobil to pressure the company to change its position on <mark>climate change</mark>. In 2005 a coalition of 12 environmental groups launched the <A href=""http://www.exxposeexxon.com/"">Exxpose Exxon</A> campaign to focus on the company’s <mark>climate</mark> denial posture and its efforts in support of exploration and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</P><P>A few years later, Exxon Mobil <A href=""http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/business/news/exxon-mobil-softens-its-<mark>climate</mark>-change-stance-467256/"">said</A> it would end its funding of at least some global warming denial groups and indicated a willingness to discuss greenhouse gas regulation. But critics such as the Union of Concerned Scientists remained skeptical and continued <A href=""http://ucsusa.org/assets/documents/global_warming/exxon_report.pdf"">criticizing</A> the company’s stance on the issue. In 2008 a proxy resolution calling on Exxon Mobil to take global warming more seriously was <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/27/business/27exxon.html"">supported</A> by a group of descendants of company founder John D. Rockefeller. The group also endorsed a resolution to create an independent chairman that did not pass but which attracted an impressive 39.5 percent of the votes.</P><P>In 2015 <EM>Inside <mark>Climate</mark> News</EM><A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken"">published</A> an exhaustive expose on Exxon's decades-long campaign of <mark>climate</mark> denial, including the suppression of its own research showing the dangers of greenhouse gases. There were subsequent <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/03/31/investigation-broadens-into-whether-exxon-mobil-misled-public-investors-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" target=""_blank"">moves</A> by the New York Attorney General and his counterparts in some other states to investigate whether the company deliberately misled investors and the public on the financial risks of <mark>climate change</mark>. The effort came as more documents <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/14/science/pressure-on-exxon-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change-intensifies-with-new-documents.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">emerged</A> suggesting that the company knew about <mark>climate</mark> dangers as early as the 1950s.

In 2017 two Harvard University researchers <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/23/<mark>climate</mark>/exxon-global-warming-science-study.html?_r=0"">published</A> a report finding that Exxon had misled the public about the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> despite its own research over many years affirming the problem.</P><P>In 2018, responding to pressure from shareholder groups to address the issue of global warmiing, Exxon Mobil <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/<mark>climate</mark>/exxon-global-warming.html"">claimed</A> it had looked into the matter and concluded that <mark>climate change</mark> poses &quot;little risk&quot; to its investments. </P><P><EM>Recent Regulatory Violations</EM></P><P>In 2008 Exxon Mobil <A href=""http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/d0cf6618525a9efb85257359003fb69d/bee3abce3fa91fd285257522006fef92%21OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=2,Exxonmobil"">agreed</A> to pay about $6 million to resolve charges that it violated the terms of a 2005 Clean Air Act settlement concerning emissions from its refineries in Texas, Louisiana and California.</P><P>Also in 2008, Exxon Mobil <A href=""http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/dc57b08b5acd42bc852573c90044a9c4/66964079fdc4700e852574ac006f4537!OpenDocument"">agreed</A> to pay $2.64 million to settle EPA charges that it violated the Toxic Substances Control Act by improperly handling and disposing of PCBs on an offshore oil and gas platform in the Santa Barbara Channel off the Southern California coast.</P><P>In 2009 a federal jury <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/science/earth/20exxon.html"">found</A> Exxon Mobil liable for contaminating ground water in New York with the gasoline additive MTBE and awarded the city $104 million in compensatory damages. That same year, the company <A href=""http://www.epa.gov/enforcement/criminal/press/2009/exxon-mobil-04-30-09.pdf"">pleaded</A> guilty to one criminal charge of violating the Clean Water Act in connection with a 2006 leak of fuel oil into the Mystic River in Massachusetts.</P><P>Also in 2009, Exxon Mobil <A href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_52/b4161030134321.htm"">put</A> itself in the center of the controversy over hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, by purchasing the shale gas company XTO Energy.</P><P>In July 2011 an Exxon Mobil pipeline in Montana ruptured, sending more than 40,000 gallons of crude oil into the Yellowstone River. Gov. Brian Schweitzer <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/09/us/09spill.html"">accused</A> the company of withholding key information and otherwise misleading public officials about the accident. In January 2013 the Associated Press <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/us/montana-exxon-faulted-for-response-to-spill.html"" target=""_blank"">reported</A> that an unpublished study by U.S. Department of Transportation investigators had found that Exxon Mobil's slow response made the spill much worse than it otherwise would have been.

In 1995 the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration <A href=""http://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/establishment.inspection_detail?id=110342607"">fined</A> the company $120,000 in connection with the accident, but the lawsuits <A href=""http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-5th-circuit/1117358.html"">dragged on</A> in federal court for more than 15 years.</P><P>In 2007 Infineum USA, a joint venture between ExxonMobil Chemical and Shell, <A href=""http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/0/f719aa895eab8c1985257275006a4ad0?OpenDocument"">agreed</A> to pay $950,000 to settle charges that it violated the Toxic Substances Control Act by using a new chemical in its auto products before the chemical had undergone a required review.</P><P>In December 2010 Environment Texas Citizen Lobby and the Sierra Club filed suit in federal court charging that ExxonMobil’s manufacturing complex in Baytown, Texas, which includes chemical production, has committed thousands of violations of the Clean Air Act. Over the past five years, ExxonMobil Chemical’s Baytown operation has <A href=""http://www.epa-echo.gov/cgi-bin/get1cReport.cgi?tool=echo&amp;IDNumber=110000463178"">paid</A> more than $190,000 in Clean Air Act penalties.</P><P>For more than a decade, ExxonMobil Chemical has <A href=""http://chej.org/2011/11/exxon-mobil-you-can%E2%80%99t-duck-reform/"">fought</A> efforts to put stricter controls on plasticizers containing phthalates and has challenged the science indicating the risks of the chemicals, which have been <A href=""http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=201010&amp;RIN=2070-AJ70"">linked</A> to reproductive and development hazards, autism, endocrine disruption, and breast cancer.

The dispute began in 1913, when some 9,000 miners employed by the Rockefeller-controlled Colorado Fuel and Iron Co. and other companies went on strike to demand union recognition as well as better working and living conditions. Several months into the walkout the state militia was sent in to attack the tent village of the strikers. During a battle with the workers the militiamen poured oil on the tents and set them afire. Two women and eleven children were killed in the blaze.</P><P>By the 1920s Jersey Standard was projecting a very different image for itself. It led the way in using paternalistic policies as a way of discouraging unionization. When labor organizations became more active in 1930s, Jersey Standard, like many other companies, created company unions to “represent” its workers. Those unions ostensibly became independent after company-dominated unions were outlawed. Yet while such independents at other oil companies eventually gave way to representation by the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers (OCAW), Jersey Standard's unions remained isolated, weak and largely under the domination of management.</P><P>Morale among both unionized and non-union workers at the company plummeted during the 1980s as Exxon eliminated tens of thousands of jobs and put the squeeze on those who remained. These policies may have had consequences outside the company. A front page article in the <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM> (March 16, 1990) suggested that accidents like that in New Jersey (see below) were the result of the company's restructuring moves. One analyst was quoted as saying Exxon's operations were “overworked and undermanned.</P><P>By the 2000s, many of the independent unions had affiliated with the Steelworkers union and were participating in industry pattern bargaining with other U.S. petroleum sector workers.   </P><P>The company has been no great friend to labor abroad. In 1990, for example, the company's International Colombia Resources subsidiary pressured the government of Colombia to crack down on a group of coal miners who had walked off the job at its facility in the country. Demands included improved housing and a shorter work week. Colombian authorities declared the strike an economic detriment to the country and ordered the miners back to work. The miners' union then reached a settlement with the company that included some of what they were seeking.</P><P>In 2003 unions representing Exxon Mobil workers in 11 countries formed a network under the auspices of the International Chemical, Energy, Mine, and General Workers’ Unions (ICEM).</P><P> </P><P><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Human Rights and Sanctions Issues</SPAN></P><P>In the 1990s there were <A href=""http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1998-12-27/indonesia-what-did-mobil-know"">allegations</A> that Mobil’s subsidiary in Indonesia collaborated with a brutal crackdown by that country’s army against Muslim separatists in Aceh province.  In 2001 the International Labor Rights Fund <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/21/business/lawsuit-says-exxon-aided-rights-abuses.html"">filed</A> a lawsuit against Exxon Mobil in federal court, accusing the company of complicity in human rights abuses. The case was dismissed by a federal district court in 2009 but was reinstated by an appeals court two years later.</P><P>In 2017 the U.S. Treasury Department <A href=""https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/CivPen/Documents/20170824_cosl.pdf"">fined</A> Exxon Mobil $2 million for violating sanctions imposed against Russia in connection with its actions in Ukraine.</P><P> </P><P><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Anti-Competitive Practices</SPAN></P><P>In 1996 the Federal Trade Commission <A href=""http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1996/09/exxon1.shtm"">filed</A> a complaint against Exxon, charging that it advertisements claiming its gasoline made engines cleaner and reduced maintenance costs were misleading. The company <A href=""http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1997/09/exxon.shtm"">signed</A> a consent order the following year.</P><P>In 2001 a federal jury in Florida <A href=""http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/apnews/stories/022001/D7A9FFU80.html"">ordered</A> Exxon to pay $500 million to 10,000 service station owners around the country who claimed that the company had overcharged them for gasoline for 12 years. The company fought the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 2005 <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/24/politics/24rights.html"">ruled</A> against Exxon, forcing it to pay an award which with interest had grown to $1.3 billion.</P><P> </P><P><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Royalties and Subsidies</SPAN></P><P>In 1998 Mobil <A href=""http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/29/business/fi-17545"">paid</A> $45 million to resolve claims that it underpaid royalties owed to the federal government for oil produced on public and Indian land in California, the Rocky Mountain States and in the Gulf of Mexico.</P><P>In 2000 a jury in Alabama <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/20/us/exxon-told-to-pay-alabama-3.5-billion-for-natural-gas.html"">ordered</A> Exxon Mobil to pay $3.5 billion in damages after it found the company guilty of defrauding the state of royalty payments from natural gas wells in state waters. That verdict was overturned on technical grounds, and in 2003 a separate jury <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/15/business/exxon-is-ordered-to-pay-11.9-billion-to-alabama.html"">awarded</A> the state $11.9 billion. The judge in the case later reduced the award back down to $3.5 billion.</P><P>Like other oil companies operating in the state, Exxon was been a major recipient of subsidies in Louisiana for decades. A March 26, 1996 article in the <EM>Baton Rouge Advocate</EM> said: “Over the years, the state of Louisiana has forgiven Exxon from paying hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.” A 1992 report called “The Great Louisiana Tax Giveaway” published by the Louisiana Coalition for Tax Justice found that Exxon’s facilities in the state (including the ones in Baton Rouge) with a combined value of $887 million had received 282 industrial property tax exemption during the 1980s. The cost to the taxpayers was estimated at $93.3 million. Exxon’s tax breaks were the fifth highest of any company in the state during the decade. Most of Exxon’s breaks were for projects that created no new permanent jobs.</P><P>In 1994 the Coalition raised the issue of tax breaks received by the Exxon Chemical plant in Baton Rouge during the course of protests about unsafe conditions at the facility, which had resulted in several serious explosions. That same year, State Senator John Guidry introduced a resolution that would have withheld $20 million in tax breaks for expansion of the facility until a final report on the latest explosion was released. The measure failed, but the publicity caused Exxon to announce that it was postponing its request.</P><P>In June 2000 the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN) awarded its first “Corporate Hog at the Trough” award to Exxon Mobil in connection with its Baton Rouge facility. The group said that Exxon had received $286 million in tax exemptions for its Baton Rouge plants over the past decade while creating only 95 permanent jobs. LEAN said Exxon had avoided paying $103 million in local school taxes during that period. The company declined the award.</P><P>Exxon Mobil has continued receiving tax abatements in Louisiana, including a $16 million <A href=""http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/subsidy-tracker/la-exxon-mobil-corporation-refinery"">award</A> to its Baton Rouge refinery in 2010.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Right now, the company assumes that its massive fossil fuel reserves will be burned to generate electricity and power cars and trucks. However, if world leaders enact limits on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions that prohibit the burning of Exxon Mobil's reserves, presumably the company's value would tumble. </P><P>This topic is of particular interest to company shareholders and financial regulators.</P><P>&quot;...

In the meantime we suggest that anyone who remains unconvinced by the record we have collected and published of the company’s internal statements confirming the reality of <mark>climate change</mark> consider its actions, especially its expenditures. Regardless of its campaign to confuse policymakers and the public, Exxon has always kept a clear eye on scientific reality when making business decisions.</P><P>In 1980, for example, Exxon paid $400 million for the rights to the Natuna natural gas field in the South China Sea. But company scientists soon realized that the field contained unusually high concentrations of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, and concluded in 1984 that extracting its gas would make it “the world’s largest point source emitter of <ABBR>CO</ABBR>2 [, which] raises concern for the possible incremental impact of Natuna on the <ABBR>CO</ABBR>2 greenhouse problem.” The company left Natuna undeveloped. Exxon’s John Woodward, who wrote an internal report on the field in 1981, told <I>Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News</I>, “They were being farsighted. They weren’t sure when <ABBR>CO</ABBR>2 controls would be required and how it would affect the economics of the project.”<SUP id=""fnr-3""><A href=""#fn-3"">3</A></SUP></P><P>This, of course, was a responsible decision. But it indicates the distance between Exxon’s decades of public deception about <mark>climate change</mark> and its internal findings. So do investments that Exxon and its Canadian subsidiary Imperial Oil made in the Arctic. As Ken Croasdale, a senior ice researcher at Imperial, told an engineering conference in 1991, concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were increasing “due to the burning of fossil fuels. Nobody disputes this fact.” Accordingly,</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>any major development with a life span of say 30–40 years will need to assess the impacts of potential global warming. This is particularly true of Arctic and offshore projects in Canada, where warming will clearly affect sea ice, icebergs, permafrost and sea levels.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Croasdale based these projections on the same <mark>climate</mark> models that Exxon’s leaders spent the next fifteen years publicly disparaging. But following his warnings that rising seas would threaten buildings on the coast, bigger waves would threaten offshore drilling platforms, and thawing permafrost would threaten pipelines, Exxon began reinforcing its Arctic infrastructure.<SUP id=""fnr-4""><A href=""#fn-4"">4</A></SUP></P><P>Similarly, as Steve Coll<SUP id=""fnr-5""><A href=""#fn-5"">5</A></SUP> wrote in <I>Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power</I> (2012), the company’s</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>investments in skeptics of the scientific consensus coincided with what at least a few of ExxonMobil’s own managers regarded as a hypocritical drive inside the corporation to explore whether <mark>climate change</mark> might offer new opportunities for oil exploration and profit.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The company tried to use the work of one of its most celebrated earth scientists, Peter Vail, to predict how alterations to the planet’s surface made by the changing <mark>climate</mark> could help it discover new deposits of oil and gas. “‘So don’t believe for a minute that ExxonMobil doesn’t think <mark>climate change</mark> is real,’ said a former manager…. ‘They were using <mark>climate change</mark> as a source of insight into exploration.’”<SUP id=""fnr-6""><A href=""#fn-6"">6</A></SUP></P><P>Soon after Rex Tillerson replaced Lee Raymond as <ABBR>CEO</ABBR> at the start of 2006, he created a secret task force to reconsider the company’s approach to <mark>climate change</mark>—“so that it would be more <mark>sustainable</mark> and less exposed,” according to one participant.<SUP id=""fnr-7""><A href=""#fn-7"">7</A></SUP> Tillerson may have been afraid that the company’s aggressive denial campaign had made it vulnerable to lawsuits.<SUP id=""fnr-8""><A href=""#fn-8"">8</A></SUP></P><P>Under his leadership, as Coll has shown, the company gradually began to change its public position on <mark>climate</mark>. In 2006 its British subsidiary promised the UK’s Royal Society it would stop funding organizations that were misinforming the public about <mark>climate</mark> science.<SUP id=""fnr-9""><A href=""#fn-9"">9</A></SUP> In 2007 Tillerson stated, “We know the <mark>climate</mark> is changing, the average temperature of the earth is rising, and greenhouse gas emissions are increasing.” (That was more than Raymond had ever admitted, but Tillerson still wouldn’t acknowledge that fossil fuel combustion caused global warming)<SUP id=""fnr-10""><A href=""#fn-10"">10</A></SUP> In January 2009—twelve days before President Obama’s inauguration would situate the company in much less welcoming political territory—Tillerson announced that ExxonMobil had become concerned enough about <mark>climate change</mark> to support a <mark>carbon</mark> tax.<SUP id=""fnr-11""><A href=""#fn-11"">11</A></SUP></P><P class=""initial"">The <mark>climate</mark> measure then under active discussion in Washington, however, was a cap-and-trade bill. There was almost no political support for a <mark>carbon</mark> tax at the time, and Tillerson’s announcement may have been meant to divert support from the reform that seemed most plausible.<SUP id=""fnr-12""><A href=""#fn-12"">12</A></SUP> Indeed, since then, although ExxonMobil continues to claim that it supports a <mark>carbon</mark> tax, it has given much more money to members of Congress who oppose such a tax than to those who endorse one.<SUP id=""fnr-13""><A href=""#fn-13"">13</A></SUP> As of last year it was still funding organizations that deny global warming or fight policies proposed to address it.<SUP id=""fnr-14""><A href=""#fn-14"">14</A></SUP> And at its annual shareholder meetings it still fiercely resists almost all meaningful resolutions on <mark>climate change</mark>.<SUP id=""fnr-15""><A href=""#fn-15"">15</A></SUP></P><P>The Securities and Exchange Commission requires companies to disclose known business risks to their investors, and Exxon’s leaders have been acutely conscious of the changing <mark>climate</mark>’s danger to the oil business for almost forty years. The company didn’t start telling its shareholders about that danger until 2007,<SUP id=""fnr-16""><A href=""#fn-16"">16</A></SUP> however, and in our opinion has never disclosed its full scope. To take just one very important example, the valuation of any oil company depends largely on its “booked reserves,” meaning the quantities of buried oil and gas to which it owns the rights.<SUP id=""fnr-17""><A href=""#fn-17"">17</A></SUP> Ultimately, however, ExxonMobil may not be able to sell most of its booked reserves, because the world’s governments, in trying to prevent catastrophic <mark>climate change</mark>, may have to adopt policies that make exploiting them economically unfeasible.</P><P>In 2013 the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (<ABBR>IPCC</ABBR>) formally endorsed the idea of a global “<mark>carbon</mark> budget,” estimating that, to keep warming to the two degrees Celsius then considered the largest increase possible without incurring catastrophe, humanity could only burn about 269 billion more tons of fossil fuels.<SUP id=""fnr-18""><A href=""#fn-18"">18</A></SUP> (We are currently burning about ten billion tons a year.)<SUP id=""fnr-19""><A href=""#fn-19"">19</A></SUP> As of 2009, however, the world had 763 billion tons of proven and economically recoverable fossil fuel reserves.<SUP id=""fnr-20""><A href=""#fn-20"">20</A></SUP></P><P>If ExxonMobil can sell only a fraction of its booked reserves—if those reserves are “stranded”—then its share price will probably decline substantially. The company has long been familiar with the concept of a <mark>carbon</mark> budget, but claims to believe it is “highly unlikely” that the world will be able to comply with the <ABBR>IPCC</ABBR>’s recommendation for such a budget. In 2014 it stated, “We are confident that none of our hydro<mark>carbon</mark> reserves are now or will become ‘stranded.’”<SUP id=""fnr-21""><A href=""#fn-21"">21</A></SUP> Because it is a matter of the highest urgency that humanity find a way to adopt the <ABBR>IPCC</ABBR>’s global <mark>carbon</mark> budget, however, it seems to us that ExxonMobil has been much too sanguine about its business prospects.<SUP id=""fnr-22""><A href=""#fn-22"">22</A></SUP> As a <I>Baltimore Sun</I> editorial about the company’s long history of <mark>climate</mark> deceptions put it, “Surely there ought to be consequences if a for-profit company knowingly tells shareholders patent falsehoods (and then those investors make decisions about their life savings without realizing they’ve been lied to).”<SUP id=""fnr-23""><A href=""#fn-23"">23</A></SUP></P><P>It is up to government officials, not public interest advocates, to determine whether ExxonMobil’s conduct has violated any state or federal laws within the relevant statutes of limitations. Recognizing this, the Rockefeller Family Fund (<ABBR>RFF</ABBR>) informed state attorneys general of our concern that ExxonMobil seemed to have failed to disclose to investors the business risks of <mark>climate change</mark>. We were particularly encouraged by Schneiderman’s interest in this matter, because New York’s Martin Act is arguably the most powerful tool in the nation for investigating possible schemes to defraud.<SUP id=""fnr-24""><A href=""#fn-24"">24</A></SUP> If ExxonMobil fully complies with Schneiderman’s subpoena, he will be able to make a thorough review of the company’s disclosures to shareholders on <mark>climate change</mark> and the history of its internal knowledge. He will then be able to decide whether or not to hold ExxonMobil legally responsible based on all the facts.</P><P>No state <ABBR>AG</ABBR>’s office can easily compete with ExxonMobil’s legal resources, however, not even New York’s. Schneiderman has been intrepid so far, but would benefit greatly from cooperation from the <ABBR>AG</ABBR>s of Massachusetts, California, and other states, as well as from the federal government. ExxonMobil has already launched aggressive legal actions against the Virgin Islands, Massachusetts, and New York in response to their investigations, and this may deter others from joining Schneiderman’s efforts.<SUP id=""fnr-25""><A href=""#fn-25"">25</A></SUP> Still, we hope that other <ABBR>AG</ABBR>s will recognize how dangerous it is when a corporation can use its wealth to discourage enforcement of possible violations of laws governing securities and consumer protection. If they believe the laws of their states may have been violated, they should initiate investigations of their own.</P><P>The <ABBR>RFF</ABBR> has also consulted with other advocates about ways to use what we know about ExxonMobil to educate the public about <mark>climate change</mark>.<SUP id=""fnr-26""><A href=""#fn-26"">26</A></SUP> The company’s suggestion that our communications with governmental officials and like-minded public interest advocates constitutes “conspiracy,” however, is absurd, ignoring the long record American civic associations have of addressing deep societal problems by use of the First Amendment.</P><P>ExxonMobil’s success in forestalling any sort of adequate response to <mark>climate change</mark> for a quarter-century makes it imperative that Congress address this swiftly descending crisis now with all possible force and urgency. If the companies that bear so much responsibility for blocking <mark>climate</mark> action have broken any laws in the process, we hope they will be held accountable. We also hope, secondarily, to make it difficult for elected officials to accept ExxonMobil’s money and do its bidding.</P><P class=""initial"">Texas Congressman Lamar Smith has taken more money in campaign contributions from oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, than from any other industry during his congressional career.<SUP id=""fnr-27""><A href=""#fn-27"">27</A></SUP> It is not hard to see why companies intent on blocking new <mark>climate</mark> policies are eager to support him. Last year, for example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration published an article in <I>Science</I> refuting the already discredited canard that <mark>climate</mark> data show no warming over the past two decades.<SUP id=""fnr-28""><A href=""#fn-28"">28</A></SUP> In response Smith issued a subpoena to the agency, demanding all its internal e-mails about <mark>climate</mark> research. An article in <I>US News and World Report</I> observed that Smith’s “brand of oversight may signal a new era for science, one where research itself is subject to political polarization.”<SUP id=""fnr-29""><A href=""#fn-29"">29</A></SUP> According to Eddie Bernice Johnson, the ranking minority member of the House Science Committee, Smith has repeatedly called former tobacco industry scientists, consultants, and public relations firms to testify at his committee’s hearings, and has relied on their guidance in previous investigations.<SUP id=""fnr-30""><A href=""#fn-30"">30</A></SUP><I>Wired</I> last year called him “Congress’ Chief <mark>Climate</mark> Denier.”<SUP id=""fnr-31""><A href=""#fn-31"">31</A></SUP></P><P>Recently, Smith has accused several <ABBR>AG</ABBR>s and environmental organizations, including the Rockefeller Family Fund, of “undermin[ing] the First Amendment of the Constitution.” He has told us at the <ABBR>RFF</ABBR> that “Congress has a duty to protect scientists and researchers from the criminalization of scientific inquiry” and “a responsibility to investigate whether [the state inquiries into ExxonMobil] are having a chilling effect on the free flow of scientific inquiry and debate regarding <mark>climate change</mark>.”<SUP id=""fnr-32""><A href=""#fn-32"">32</A></SUP> As the dean of the Yale Law School wrote in <I>The</I><I>Washington Post</I>, “It is hard to exaggerate the brazen audacity of this argument.”<SUP id=""fnr-33""><A href=""#fn-33"">33</A></SUP> Johnson wrote to Smith that “in a Congress in which the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology’s oversight powers have been repeatedly abused, this latest action stands apart…. Never in the history of this formerly esteemed Committee has oversight been carried out with such open disregard for truth, fairness, and the rule of law.”<SUP id=""fnr-34""><A href=""#fn-34"">34 </A></SUP>The <I>San Antonio Express-News</I>, Smith’s hometown paper, which had previously endorsed his bids for reelection, declined to do so this year because of his “abuse of his position as chairman” and his “bullying on the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>.”<SUP id=""fnr-35""><A href=""#fn-35"">35</A></SUP></P><FIGURE data-id=""55240"" data-usage-terms=""3,60,2016-11-22"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text""><SMALL>Will Rose/Greenpeace </SMALL>Greenpeace activists preparing to board an ExxonMobil oil rig in Norwegian waters to protest its plans to drill for oil in the Russian Arctic, March 2014</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Congressional committees have very limited jurisdiction over state law enforcement officers engaged in the good-faith execution of their duties, and never before has Congress subpoenaed a state attorney general.<SUP id=""fnr-36""><A href=""#fn-36"">36</A></SUP> The <ABBR>AG</ABBR>s investigating ExxonMobil are trying to determine whether the company has defrauded shareholders according to the laws of their states.<SUP id=""fnr-37""><A href=""#fn-37"">37</A></SUP> Fraud, of course, is not protected by the First Amendment, and since the <ABBR>AG</ABBR>s are responsible for prosecuting fraud, they must be free to investigate it.</P><P>As for the nonprofit organizations the Science Committee has subpoenaed, including our own, it is obviously not within our power to violate anyone’s First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court has called it “a commonplace that the constitutional guarantee of free speech is a guarantee only against abridgment by government, federal or state.”<SUP id=""fnr-38""><A href=""#fn-38"">38</A></SUP> That aside, we have no wish to silence anyone, or to interfere with free scientific inquiry. For the best ideas to prevail, however, people must be allowed to point out instances of inaccurate or dishonest speech. And indeed, by calling attention to the deep, largely orchestrated dishonesty that has characterized the <mark>climate</mark> denial movement ever since its inception, we are supporting genuine scientific inquiry.</P><P>We have tried to reach a reasonable accommodation with the Science Committee. But we do wish to criticize ExxonMobil on moral grounds for its long effort to confuse and deceive the public about <mark>climate change</mark>. Moreover, we believe that the willingness of some members of Congress to echo and defend ExxonMobil’s obfuscation of established <mark>climate</mark> science is an inexcusable breach of the public trust. It is our First Amendment right to express these views.</P><P>In fact, the Science Committee is doing to the people and organizations it subpoenaed exactly what it accuses us of doing. It is trying to chill the First Amendment rights of those who would petition government, speak freely, and freely associate to advocate for responsible <mark>climate</mark> policies.<SUP id=""fnr-39""><A href=""#fn-39"">39</A></SUP> The legal fees we have incurred because of its demands are bearable for the <ABBR>RFF</ABBR>, but they would be crippling for many smaller organizations. We also face civil or criminal liability if we are held in contempt of Congress because we will not accede to these demands.</P><P>More seriously, the committee’s actions now force all organizations that would collaborate with others when taking on powerful special interests to consider that they might be ordered to reveal their strategies to any hostile member of Congress with subpoena power. This is a clear injury to the First Amendment right of association. As the Ninth Circuit wrote in <I>Perry</I> v. <I>Schwarzenegger</I> (2010):</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Implicit in the right to associate with others to advance one’s shared political beliefs is the right to exchange ideas and formulate strategy and messages, and to do so in private.

This is not so different from ExxonMobil’s politicized variant of the “Tobacco Strategy”—people will be tempted simply to take the side with which they sympathize ideologically. Meanwhile, the committee is creating a distraction from the real issues, which are what Exxon knew, and when; what it did with its knowledge; and what options humanity has left to prevent the worst consequences of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P class=""initial"">Thousands of scientists from around the world contribute to the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>’s reports, reviewing and synthesizing the published literature on <mark>climate</mark> science every few years. The summaries for policymakers that encapsulate those reports must then be considered and approved, line by line, by representatives of over 120 different countries.<SUP id=""fnr-42""><A href=""#fn-42"">42</A></SUP> Because of the remarkable number of scientists participating in the <ABBR>IPCC</ABBR>’s work, it is generally considered the world’s greatest institutional authority on <mark>climate</mark> science.<SUP id=""fnr-43""><A href=""#fn-43"">43</A></SUP> But because it requires the approval of so many nations, including oil producers like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and because it is subject to political manipulation, as happened when ExxonMobil convinced the Bush administration to have its chairman replaced in 2001,<SUP id=""fnr-44""><A href=""#fn-44"">44</A></SUP> the <ABBR>IPCC</ABBR>’s conclusions are generally considered quite conservative.<SUP id=""fnr-45""><A href=""#fn-45"">45</A></SUP></P><P>Still, the predictions of the <ABBR>IPCC</ABBR>’s latest report, published last year, are dire.<SUP id=""fnr-46""><A href=""#fn-46"">46</A></SUP> In this century, disastrous weather events such as storms, droughts, floods, fires, and heat waves will become more common and more severe. Changes to regional weather will have especially serious consequences in places that are already poor, as areas that are semiarid now, for example, become too dry to farm at all. Low-lying islands and coastal cities around the world will be threatened by rising sea levels. In many parts of the world, both the quantity and the quality of fresh water will decline.</P><P>For a time, some places will see agricultural productivity increase as the planet warms and rainfall distribution shifts; but others will face shortages of food and the possibility of famine. Globally, total agricultural output is expected to be lower at the end of the century than it is now. The challenge of feeding the world’s people will be exacerbated by declining fisheries as the oceans warm and turn more acidic. Many plant and animal species will become extinct as climatic changes outpace their ability to adapt, others will migrate to new regions, and all of this will have cascading effects on most ecosystems. (For example, the combination of much larger wildfires than we are used to seeing and invasive beetle species may endanger the world’s boreal forests—and if they disappear, they will release vast additional quantities of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into the atmosphere.) Old diseases will spread and new ones emerge.</P><P>These different effects of <mark>climate change</mark> will interact with each other in complex ways, some of which may not be predictable now. It seems clear, however, that the poorest parts of the world will become poorer still, and economies everywhere will be threatened. (A 1980 American Petroleum Institute meeting in which Exxon participated concluded that at a “3% per annum growth rate of <mark>CO2</mark>, a 2.5° C rise [in average global temperature] brings world economic growth to a halt in about 2025.”)<SUP id=""fnr-47""><A href=""#fn-47"">47</A></SUP> Conflict over dwindling resources will increase around the world; so, dramatically, will human migration and political instability.</P><P>As a group of retired American generals and admirals who studied the national security implications of <mark>climate change</mark> concluded in 2007:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Economic and environmental conditions in already fragile areas will further erode as food production declines, diseases increase, clean water becomes increasingly scarce, and large populations move in search of resources. Weakened and failing governments, with an already thin margin for survival, foster the conditions for internal conflicts, extremism, and movement toward increased authoritarianism and radical ideologies.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>It is true that scientists still disagree about precisely how severe the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> will be, and when. But, the generals and admirals wrote, “As military leaders, we know we cannot wait for certainty. Failing to act because a warning isn’t precise enough is unacceptable.”<SUP id=""fnr-48""><A href=""#fn-48"">48</A></SUP></P><P class=""initial"">The world’s governments should have acted decades ago. When the Exxon scientist James Black wrote in 1978 that “the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical” in “five to ten years,” he was right.<SUP id=""fnr-49""><A href=""#fn-49"">49</A></SUP> That was humanity’s best chance to start making the transition to a clean energy economy before so much <mark>CO2</mark> was released into the atmosphere that a great deal of warming became unavoidable. In our opinion, the reason the world has failed to act for so long is in no small part because the <mark>climate</mark> denial campaign that Exxon helped devise and lead was so successful.</P><P>Just as the tobacco industry gained decades of huge profits by obfuscating the dangers of smoking, the oil industry secured decades of profits—in Exxon’s case, some of the largest profits of any corporation in history—by helping to create a fake controversy over <mark>climate</mark> science that deceived and victimized many policymakers, as well as much of the public. The bogus science it paid for through front groups, which was then repeated and validated by industry-funded, right-wing think tanks and a too-easily cowed press, worked just as well for ExxonMobil as it had for R.J. Reynolds. A 2004 study by Naomi Oreskes in <I>Science</I> examined 928 peer-reviewed papers on <mark>climate</mark> science and found that not a single one disputed global warming’s existence or its human cause.<SUP id=""fnr-50""><A href=""#fn-50"">50</A></SUP> But according to a recent Yale University study, only 11 percent of Americans understand that there is a scientific consensus on these points.<SUP id=""fnr-51""><A href=""#fn-51"">51</A></SUP></P><P>The <mark>climate</mark> deniers succeeded in politicizing a formerly nonpartisan issue and a threat to all humanity.<SUP id=""fnr-52""><A href=""#fn-52"">52</A></SUP> In consequence, for decades now, meaningful congressional action to address <mark>climate change</mark> has been impossible.

The recently completed Paris agreement on <mark>climate</mark>, for which the Obama administration fought, will be effective—but only if the world’s nations live up to the commitments they made in it. Although, as a result in part of the actions of ExxonMobil, we have already missed our best chance to prevent a reordering of the world’s ecological balance due to <mark>climate change</mark>, we can still avoid its worst effects.

Cap-and-trade is a market-based mechanism designed to reduce <mark>pollution</mark>, in this case greenhouse gases. The Waxman-Markey Bill passed by the US House of Representatives in 2009 set a “cap” that established the total amount of allowable greenhouse gas emissions from certain industries. The cap declined over time until emissions would have been reduced by 80 percent in 2050 from 2005 levels. Under the bill, permits to emit <mark>carbon</mark>—which, when added together, comprised the cap—were either auctioned or allocated to the states, to historic polluters (e.g., utilities, refineries, cement plants), or for other public purposes. The bill required emitters to obtain and submit a permit for each ton of <mark>pollution</mark> they produced. No industry was allocated so many permits that it would not need to purchase additional ones. This was intended to create a clear financial incentive to reduce emissions. As the cap declined and the number of allocated permits shrank, the incentive would become even stronger.
By contrast, under a <mark>carbon</mark> tax regime there is no cap. Instead, typically, the first importer or producer of fossil-based fuel is assessed a tax based on the <mark>carbon</mark> content of the fuel. Because coal contains the most <mark>carbon</mark>, it would be charged at the highest rate, followed by oil and then natural gas. The tax would be passed along to consumers, creating a market signal to reduce consumption of the <mark>carbon</mark>-based fuels. <A href=""#fnr-12"" class=""footnoteBackLink"" title=""Jump back to footnote 12 in the text"">↩</A></P></LI><LI id=""fn-13""><SPAN class=""marker"">13</SPAN><P>See Elliott Negin, <A href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elliott-negin/exxonmobils-latest-campai_b_11408752.html"">“ExxonMobil’s Latest Campaign to Stymie Federal <mark>Climate</mark> Action,”</A><I>The Huffington Post</I>, August 8, 2016.  <A href=""#fnr-13"" class=""footnoteBackLink"" title=""Jump back to footnote 13 in the text"">↩</A></P></LI><LI id=""fn-14""><SPAN class=""marker"">14</SPAN><P>See Elliott Negin, <A href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elliott-negin/exxonmobil-is-still-fundi_b_10955254.html"">“ExxonMobil Is Still Funding <mark>Climate</mark> Science Denier Groups,”</A><I>The Huffington Post</I>, July 13, 2016.  <A href=""#fnr-14"" class=""footnoteBackLink"" title=""Jump back to footnote 14 in the text"">↩</A></P></LI><LI id=""fn-15""><SPAN class=""marker"">15</SPAN><P>See Steven Mufson, <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/<mark>climate</mark>-resolutions-fall-short-at-exxon-mobils-annual-meeting/2016/05/25/7108d45c-2287-11e6-9e7f-57890b612299_story.html?utm_term=.76fc9d697f5a"">“<mark>Climate</mark> Resolutions Fall Short at ExxonMobil’s Annual Meeting,”</A><I>The Washington Post</I>, May 25, 2016.  <A href=""#fnr-15"" class=""footnoteBackLink"" title=""Jump back to footnote 15 in the text"">↩</A></P></LI><LI id=""fn-16""><SPAN class=""marker"">16</SPAN><P>See Lieberman and Rust, “Big Oil Braced for Global Warming.”  <A href=""#fnr-16"" class=""footnoteBackLink"" title=""Jump back to footnote 16 in the text"">↩</A></P></LI><LI id=""fn-17""><SPAN class=""marker"">17</SPAN><P>See Coll, <I>Private Empire</I>, pp. 51, 57.  <A href=""#fnr-17"" class=""footnoteBackLink"" title=""Jump back to footnote 17 in the text"">↩</A></P></LI><LI id=""fn-18""><SPAN class=""marker"">18</SPAN><P>See <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>central.org/news/ipcc-<mark>climate</mark>-change-report-contains-grave-<mark>carbon</mark>-budget-message-16569"" target=""_blank"">IPCC Report Contains ‘Grave’ <mark>Carbon</mark> Budget Message</A>.  <A href=""#fnr-18"" class=""footnoteBackLink"" title=""Jump back to footnote 18 in the text"">↩</A></P></LI><LI id=""fn-19""><SPAN class=""marker"">19</SPAN><P>See <A href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2016/06/08/world-sets-record-for-fossil-fuel-consumption/#353f90411ea6"" target=""_blank"">World Sets Record For Fossil Fuel Consumption</A>; Avaneesh Pandey, <A href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/<mark>climate</mark>-change-10-billion-tons-<mark>carbon</mark>-are-now-being-released-every-year-fastest-66-2340770"">“<mark>Climate Change</mark>: 10 Billion Tons of <mark>Carbon</mark> Are Now Being Released Every Year, The Fastest in 66 Million Years,”</A><I>International Business Times</I>, March 22, 2016. <A href=""#fnr-19"" class=""footnoteBackLink"" title=""Jump back to footnote 19 in the text"">↩</A></P></LI><LI id=""fn-20""><SPAN class=""marker"">20</SPAN><P>See Malte Meinshausen, Nicolai Meinshausen, William Hare, Sarah C.

From our perspective, the e-mail contained some rhetorical bravado (though it was never intended for publication, of course), and while we consider Exxon’s actions immoral, we have no particular interest in persuading the public that the company is corrupt.

</H1><DIV class=""byline_wrap""><SPAN class=""post-categories""> Posted in <A href=""https://www.dandodiary.com/articles/securities-litigation/"">Securities Litigation</A></SPAN></DIV></HEADER><SECTION class=""post-content""><P>For many years, I have been <A href=""https://www.dandodiary.com/2009/11/articles/environmental-liability/new-environment-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/"">raising the possibility</A> of <mark>climate change</mark>-related corporate and securities litigation. However, despite my best prognostication, the <mark>climate change</mark>-related  corporate and securities lawsuits have basically failed to materialize – that is, until now. On November 7, 2016, investors filed a purported securities class action lawsuit in the Northern District of Texas against <mark>Exxon Mobil Corpo</mark>ration and certain of its directors and officers. The lawsuit specifically references the company’s <mark>climate change</mark>-related disclosures, as well as the company’s valuation of its existing oil and gas reserves. One lawsuit doesn’t make a trend, and many of the lawsuit’s allegations relates specifically to Exxon Mobil and its particular disclosures. Nevertheless, the filing of the lawsuit raises the question whether there may be other <mark>climate change</mark>-related disclosure cases ahead. A copy of the November 7, 2016 lawsuit can be found <A href=""https://dandodiary.lexblogplatformthree.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/265/2016/11/exxon-complaint.pdf"">here</A>.</P><P> </P><P>The plaintiff’s complaint alleges that throughout the purported class period, Exxon “repeatedly highlighted the strength of its business model and its transparency and reporting integrity, particularly with regard to its oil and gas reserves and the value of those reserves.” The complaint alleges that Exxon’s public statements were materially false and misleading as they failed to disclose:</P><P> </P><OL><LI>that Exxon’s own internally generated reports concerning <mark>climate change</mark> recognized that the environmental risks caused by global warming and <mark>climate change</mark>;</LI><LI>that, given the risks associated with global warming and <mark>climate change</mark>, the Company would not be able to extract the existing hydro<mark>carbon</mark> reserves Exxon claimed to have and, therefore, that a material portion of Exxon’s reserves were stranded and should have been written down; and</LI><LI>that Exxon had employed an inaccurate “price of <mark>carbon</mark>” – the cost of regulations such as a <mark>carbon</mark> tax or a cap-and-trade system to push down emissions – in evaluating the value of certain of its future oil and gas prospects in order to keep its reserves materially overstated.</LI></OL><P> </P><P>The complaint alleges that these alleged misrepresentations caused the company’s share price to be inflated; while the share price was inflated the company conducted a $12 billion public debt offering.</P><P> </P><P>The complaint further alleges that in mid-August 2016 and late September 2016, the market learned that federal regulators were scrutinizing Exxon’s reserve accounting related to <mark>climate change</mark> and global warming and the company’s refusal to write down any of its oil and gas reserves in the face of declining oil prices. However, on October 28, 2016, the company disclosed that “it might be forced to write down nearly 20% of its oil and gas assets.” The company’s share price allegedly fell on the news.</P><P> </P><P>The complaint’s allegations about the company’s <mark>climate change</mark>-related disclosures had previously been raised  by regulators that had subpoenaed the company’s internal research regarding <mark>climate change</mark> risks, as discussed <A href=""https://www.dandodiary.com/2015/11/articles/environmental-liability/up-next-<mark>climate</mark>-change-disclosure-and-corporate-liability-exposures/"">here</A>. In connection with these regulatory investigations, questions previously had been raised about whether the company’s had failed to disclose that its own internal findings concerning <mark>climate change</mark>. In September 2016, it was <A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-investigating-exxon-on-valuing-of-assets-accounting-practices-1474393593"">reported</A> that the SEC was investigating the company’s <mark>climate change</mark> disclosures.</P><P> </P><P>The company’s October 28, 2016 disclosure that it may need to write down some of its oil and gas assets also drew a great deal of attention and scrutiny (refer for example <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/business/energy-environment/exxon-concedes-it-may-need-to-declare-lower-value-for-oil-in-ground.html"">here</A>).</P><P> </P><P>As I <A href=""https://www.dandodiary.com/2015/11/articles/environmental-liability/up-next-<mark>climate</mark>-change-disclosure-and-corporate-liability-exposures/"">said at the time</A> when the investigative subpoenas directed to Exxon first emerged, <mark>climate change</mark>-related disclosures are going to continue to be the source of scrutiny that potentially could affect a wide range of companies. To provide just one example, on November 9, 2015, the NYAG’s office announced (<A href=""http://www.ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-secures-unprecedented-agreement-peabody-energy-end-misleading"">here</A>) that it had reached a settlement with Peabody Coal of charges that the company’s <mark>climate change</mark> related disclosure violated New York law. The company agreed to file revised shareholder disclosures that “accurately and objectively represent these risks to investors and the public.” The terms of the company’s agreement with the NYAG’s office can be found <A href=""http://ag.ny.gov/pdfs/Peabody-Energy-Assurance-signed.pdf"">here</A>.<EM> </EM></P><P><EM> </EM></P><P>Much of this attention and scrutiny is the result of initiatives by environmental activists and politically motivated activity by elected officials. However, environmental activists are not the only ones agitating to make <mark>climate change</mark> disclosure a priority. Indeed, for several years now, the National Association of Insurance Commission’s has been actively campaigning to make the disclosure of <mark>climate change</mark> risks a priority for the insurance industry in the United States. The NAIC’s latest update on the topic can be found <A href=""http://www.naic.org/cipr_topics/topic_<mark>climate</mark>_risk_disclosure.htm"">here</A>.</P><P> </P><P>Enterprising plaintiffs’ lawyers seeking to diversify their product line will likely will assess whether or not <mark>climate change</mark> disclosure represents a promising new liability area. Just as the question of future global <mark>climate change</mark> itself is fraught with uncertainty edged with menace, the question whether <mark>climate change</mark>-related disclosure represents a potential new source of corporate liability exposure is itself both uncertain and more than a little scary. The issue represents a potential concern for companies in a variety of industries; not just energy companies like Exxon, but also utilities, mining companies, automobile manufacturers, transportation companies, insurance companies, and many others.</P><P> </P><P>It may be that D&amp;O insurance underwriters decided they didn’t need to worry about <mark>climate change</mark>-related exposures. As I have noted in the past with respect to these areas, the problem has been the possibility that these issues might move from the background, where they have been, to the front burner. The filing of the Exxon securities lawsuit may be the first move in that direction.</P></SECTION><FOOTER class=""post-footer""><SPAN class=""post-tags""> Tags: <A href=""https://www.dandodiary.com/tags/<mark>climate</mark>-change/""><mark>climate change</mark>,</A><A href=""https://www.dandodiary.com/tags/environmental-disclosure/"">environmental disclosure,</A><A href=""https://www.dandodiary.com/tags/exxon-mobil/"">exxon mobil,</A><A href=""https://www.dandodiary.com/tags/litigation-trends/"">litigation trends</A></SPAN></FOOTER></ARTICLE></DIV><ASIDE class=""sidebar""><ASIDE id=""text-19"" class=""widget widget_text ""><H3 class=""widget-title"">About Kevin</H3><DIV class=""textwidget"">Kevin M.

These accusations indicated at a fraud and the company was asked to present more documents.Schneiderman’s filing followed a day after President Trump announced plans to pull out of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord. Per the accord, about 200 countries vowed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to slow global warming. The President’s decision was condemned by several world leaders and many U.S. executives.<STRONG>How Investors Were Mislead</STRONG>Eric Schneiderman is believed to hold evidence against ExxonMobil that can prove that the company had been presenting false and misleading statements. This could have led investors to think that ExxonMobil had accurately evaluated the risks. However, the company is likely to have overlooked a formula to estimate the impact of future environmental regulation on new deals.In his filings, Schneiderman focused on the method used by ExxonMobil to present investors with estimates of the regulatory cost of greenhouse gas emissions on new projects. The company often presented a number it called a “proxy cost” for greenhouse gases. Through this, the company tried to account for prospective changes to government policy that will make the production and consumption of fossil fuels more costly.Per Schneiderman, this whole accounting may be a fraud as the company might not have used it when calculating profits and losses on investments. This can again be verified by examining ExxonMobil’s documents of oil sands project, which indicates profit over the course of the project’s original timeline. The case would have been separate, if ExxonMobil applied the proxy cost it promised to shareholders. Per the attorney general, at least one significant oil sand project might have projected a financial loss.Along with Schneiderman’s reports, ExxonMobil’s <mark>climate</mark>-related statements to investors are also being examined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on how it values its oil and gas reserves amid low prices as well as potential restrain on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.However, the company has denied such allegations and stated that its external statements have correctly presented the use of a proxy cost of <mark>carbon</mark>. Also, the documents forwarded to the attorney general make this fact apparent. The company will present more documents to support court filings.<STRONG>Transparency Issue</STRONG>Recently, ExxonMobil has been actively involved in implementing <mark>climate change</mark> policies, thanks to tremendous pressure from investors and environmentalists. The primary objectives include the restriction of greenhouse gas emissions, reduction in global warming, appointment of a <mark>climate</mark> expert on the board, reports on fracking activities and <mark>climate change</mark> impact assessments.As a result, the company has increased <mark>climate</mark>-related disclosures. These disclosures include affirmation of the company’s pledge to the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement, inclusion of an environmental expert to its board and the reduction of emission from its operations. However, ExxonMobil is avoiding shareholders’ request for additional information regarding the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> in its operations.However, the company has been struggling with Schneiderman’s requests for information about its <mark>climate change</mark> policies in state and federal court. ExxonMobil argues that it is not liable to produce records because the New York-based prosecutor’s probe is politically provoked and is an insult.The opposition by ExxonMobil has led to a strange situation. Usually, State and federal prosecutors only disclose their findings once they have concluded the process and are ready to file charges.ExxonMobil sued Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is also questioning the company in federal court. Moreover, the company’s effort to challenge Schneiderman’s subpoenas has led the prosecutor to forward the proofs to fight his case on why ExxonMobil should be forced to provide more documents.As part of the inquiry, ExxonMobil has already submitted 2 million documents. These documents have revealed that Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of ExxonMobil, used a separate email address under a different name — Wayne Tracker — to talk about <mark>climate change</mark>-related issues while at the company.Schneiderman is searching more documents, that haven’t been forwarded by ExxonMobil. He is trying to interrogate employees who might know about the company’s internal <mark>climate change</mark> plans. <STRONG>How ExxonMobil Plans to Fight <mark>Climate Change</mark></STRONG>ExxonMobil has launched a plan to slash methane emissions from its onshore assets in the United States. The company plans to replace old equipments with updated technology. It has already invested about $8 billion on energy efficiency and low-emission technologies such as <mark>carbon</mark> capture and next-generation biofuels.ExxonMobil will focus on employee training to reduce emissions. The company plans to study the use of satellites, drones and other relevant equipment in controlling future leakages. The company's ally, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, may help with drones for detecting methane.<STRONG>Other Lawsuits Filed on <mark>Climate Change</mark> Issues</STRONG>In September 2017, two major Californian cities — San Francisco and Oakland — filed lawsuits against five oil and energy super majors. The cities had taken legal action against Chevron Corp.

This includes the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on energy prices and the environment as well as the company’s ability to develop reserves.Notably, many such lawsuits have been filed in the past which did not bear results. In 2009, Kivalina, AK, filed charges against many oil companies which got dismissed in the court and repealed by the Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency.In 2011, the Supreme Court of U.S. overruled the public nuisance claims of eight states and the New York City against electric utility companies. In July 2017, similar litigation cases were filed by two coastal counties of California — Marin and San Mateo — against oil majors like Chevron, BP, Shell and ExxonMobil among others for rising sea levels. The charges claimed that the companies were responsible for emitting about 20% of greenhouse gases between 1965 and 2015.The verdict is pending and there are chances that this case might fail given the complex nature of legal requirements.<STRONG>Bottom Line</STRONG>Of late, ExxonMobil’s argument was dismissed by the U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan as “implausible”. Also, Schneiderman and Healey were said to be pursuing politically motivated as well as fraud investigations with the intention of breaching its constitutional rights. Even the Massachusetts Supreme Court rejected ExxonMobil’s appeal to block the state’s attorney general from obtaining records to examine whether the company had hidden its knowledge of the role of fossil fuels in <mark>climate change</mark> for decades.Caproni discharged the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning the Irving, Texas-based company cannot bring it again.This is a major turning point, which is likely to result in ExxonMobil being prosecuted for misleading investors. Moreover, the documents produced by the company and evidences shown by Schneiderman are against the company.<STRONG>Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending</STRONG>A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it.

ExxonMobil argues that this has violated the company’s First Amendment right to free speech.</P><P>Specifically, ExxonMobil seeks to investigate 16 individuals who the company claims are behind a litigation campaign that led to California communities suing Exxon and others in 2017. Last July, Marin and San Mateo counties, along with the city of Imperial Beach, <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/18072017/oil-gas-coal-companies-exxon-shell-sued-coastal-california-city-counties-sea-level-rise"">sued 37 oil, gas, and coal companies</A> for allegedly knowing that fossil-fuel use would lead to <mark>climate change</mark>-related sea-level rise, and failing to warn the public. The communities want the companies to pay, arguing that corporations were responsible for roughly 20% of total emissions from 1965 to 2015. Since, other California coastal communities have joined the suit.</P><P>ExxonMobil is taking the <mark>climate change</mark> fight to <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/09012018/exxon-california-coastal-cities-<mark>climate</mark>-change-damages-lawsuit-texas-court"">friendlier turf</A>. The company is located in Texas, a state that appreciates Big Oil. But it isn’t yet counter-suing the California communities. With this request, ExxonMobil is simply asking a Texas court to allow it to depose 16 individuals, private and governmental attorneys it claims are behind that California case and other “abusive” litigations that are designed to push policy positions rather than to remedy actual, provable harms. Now, it’s asking the Texas court permission to officially question the 16 individuals to determine whether to file a countersuit.</P><FIGURE id=""image-1178141"" class=""progressive-image inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium""><FIGCAPTION class=""inline-image-caption"">Exxon filing.<SPAN class=""inline-image-credit has-space""> (Exxon filing.)</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P><A href=""https://www.hbsslaw.com/attorneys/partner/matthew-f-pawa-partner-co-chair-of-environmental-practice-group"">First on the list, for example, is Matthew Pawa</A>, an environmental attorney. Pawa represented New Hampshire in a groundwater-contamination case against ExxonMobil, winning the state $236 million in damages after a jury trial in 2013. ExxonMobil now alleges that Pawa (and the 15 others on the filing) conspired with state and municipal attorneys in an “abusive” nationwide law enforcement and litigation campaign which arose from a 2012 gathering of attorneys and scientists in La Jolla, California.</P><P>At that meeting, ExxonMobil argues, this group planned a massive nationwide campaign, based not on the desires of constituents but on the politics of a few. The filing explains:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>This conspiracy emerged out of frustration in New York, Massachusetts, and California with voters in other parts of the country and with the federal government for failing to adopt their preferred policies on <mark>climate change</mark>. But rather than focusing their efforts in the marketplace of ideas and adopting a strategy of persuasion, the members of this conspiracy chose to advance their political objectives by imposing unlawful burdens on perceived political opponents.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>That rhetoric might sound familiar. The notion that <mark>climate</mark>-change skeptics are targeted by leftists is a common conservative complaint. In 2016, Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the right-leaning Heritage Foundation, <A href=""http://dailysignal.com/2016/12/28/the-california-gathering-that-hatched-plan-to-prosecute-skeptics-of-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">said that</A> that there is an “incestuous relationship between <mark>climate</mark> -change activists and partisan state attorneys general” who “are subverting our democratic system by using the courts to silence the opposition to…an unproven scientific theory.<I>”</I></P><P>Exxon isn’t going so far as denying <mark>climate change</mark> science. On the contrary—the filing argues that the company “has long acknowledged the risks presented by <mark>climate change</mark>, supported the Paris <mark>climate</mark> accords, and backed a revenue-neutral <mark>carbon</mark> tax” but is nevertheless “targeted by state and local governments for pretextual investigations and litigation intended to cleanse the public square of alternative viewpoints.”</P><P>This claim runs contrary to recent research that indicates ExxonMobil deliberately misled the public in its communications about <mark>climate</mark> for decades. In August 2017, a Harvard study, published in the journal <A href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa815f/pdf"">Environmental Letters</A> (pdf), examined 187 ExxonMobil communications on <mark>climate change</mark> published between 1977 and 2014 in places like peer-reviewed journals, advertorials, and internal documents. The study concluded that as the effects of fossil fuels became more widely known, ExxonMobil’s public-facing communications increasingly expressed doubt about science that it internally acknowledged to be true. The paper explained:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>This discrepancy is most pronounced between advertorials and all other documents. For example, accounting for expressions of reasonable doubt, 83% of peer-reviewed papers and 80% of internal documents acknowledge that <mark>climate change</mark> is real and human-caused, yet only 12% of advertorials do so, with 81% instead expressing doubt. We conclude that ExxonMobil contributed to advancing <mark>climate</mark> science—by way of its scientists’ academic publications—but promoted doubt about it in advertorials. Given this discrepancy, we conclude that ExxonMobil misled the public.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The timing of ExxonMobil’s request <A href=""https://www.courthousenews.com/five-oil-giants-sued-by-nyc-for-contributions-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">coincides neatly</A> with another <mark>climate</mark>-related legal case filed on Jan. 9. New York City is suing Big Oil, claiming that in recent decades the fossil-fuel industry behaved like Big Tobacco last century, using “disinformation campaigns” to encourage use of products that oil companies knew were dangerous to the planet. The companies named in that case: BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell, and, of course, ExxonMobil.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The sizeable increase over last year's 38 percent support for a similar report signaled the non-binding proposal was backed by at least some of Exxon's top institutional shareholders.</P><P>Exxon had stepped up efforts to persuade investors to vote against <mark>climate</mark>-related proposals at Wednesday's annual meeting with a campaign of calling, writing and lobbying shareholders in person.</P><P>The world's largest publicly traded oil company opposed the proposal requiring it to report on the risks to its business from new technologies and global <mark>climate change</mark> policies, insisting it already provides the information.</P><P>The stakes have gotten higher since the last vote. The business-impact issue is central to lawsuits by two state attorneys general alleging Exxon soft-peddled the risks to consumers and shareholders. Wall Street support of similar measures also has convinced energy companies including <A class=""inline_quotes"" data-gdsid=""27849"" data-inline-quote-symbol=""OXY"" href=""//www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=OXY"" target=""_self"">Occidental Petroleum</A> to address the Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord's goal of keeping global temperature increases under 2-degrees Celsius.</P><P>Had the proposal garnered less than last year's 38 percent support, it would have endorsed Exxon's view which is that its current reporting is appropriate, said Rob Schuwerk, senior counsel for environmental think tank <mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker Initiative.</P><P>But with support this year in excess of 50 percent, the oil company will likely do more to explain potential business impacts from having to meet the Paris agreement's temperature goal, Schuwerk said prior to the vote. A result in between the two, he said, would have been &quot;the hazy middle&quot; that would still show growing investor interest in <mark>climate</mark> issues.</P><P>Exxon took a conciliatory approach in a letter to investors on Tuesday. Vice President Jeff Woodbury wrote that on many of the shareholder proposals &quot;the corporation agrees with the underlying objective — we just have a different view on the best means to achieve it.&quot;</P><P>Prior shareholder letters insisted the proposals were misguided or ignored the company's efforts to spell out its position that even in a world intent on limited temperature rises, it would still need more oil.</P><P>Anne Sheehan, head of corporate governance at California State Teachers' Retirement System, which backed the additional <mark>climate</mark> reporting, said Exxon's letter had suggested the voting was at least very close and would go against the company.</P><P>&quot;You're not going to do an eleventh-hour shareholder communication if everything was going swimmingly,&quot; she said in an interview.</P><P>In addition to the vote on the <mark>climate</mark>-impact report, Exxon holders considered proposals to shift spending to dividends and buybacks from oil exploration and on a proposal to require a report on its efforts to restrict emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas.</P><P>Exxon opposed all these proposals and has actively lobbied shareholders. This campaign &quot;is a lot more intense than normal,&quot; said one investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. &quot;I think they're pulling out all the stops.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""group-container last""><H4 class=""subtitle"">Billboards and rallies</H4><DIV class=""group"" itemprop=""articleBody""><P><mark>Climate</mark> campaigners were also active ahead of Wednesday's vote.

ExxonMobil’s board argued that disclosure is already covered by their “<A href=""http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/energy/energy-outlook"">Outlook for Energy</A>” projections and other publications, but said it would reconsider its stance against additional disclosure in light of the shareholder request.</P><P>“<mark>Climate change</mark> is one of the greatest long-term risks we face in our portfolio and has direct impact on the core business of ExxonMobil,” New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in a statement. “The burden is now on ExxonMobil to respond swiftly and demonstrate that it takes shareholder concerns about <mark>climate</mark> risk seriously,”</P><P>In the weeks leading up to the shareholder meeting and in their <A href=""http://cdn.exxonmobil.com/~/media/global/files/investor-reports/2017/2017_proxy_statement.pdf"">proxy statement</A> to investors, ExxonMobil noted the “importance of assessing the resiliency of the Company’s resource portfolio” but urged investors to vote against additional disclosures.</P><P>ExxonMobil shareholders’ support for disclosing the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> comes on the heels of a similar move by shareholders from Occidental Petroleum, who passed the reporting measure by 67 percent on May 12.</P><P>“We look forward to continuing our shareholder engagement on the topic and providing additional disclosure about the Company’s assessment and management of <mark>climate</mark>-related risks and opportunities,” Eugene Batchelder, board chairman of Occidental Petroleum, said in a written statement Wednesday.</P><P>Analysts pointed to Occidental and ExxonMobil’s moves as the start of a trend in <mark>climate change</mark> risk disclosure.

The combined value of the company in 2015 was $353bn, making it the world's most valuable, publicly traded oil company.</P><P>The company employs around 75,000 around the world. </P><P>The oil spill from the Exxon Valdez tanker in Alaska in 1989 was the biggest in US history until Deepwater Horizon in 2010.</P><P>In 2016, the Rockefeller foundation said it would eliminate its holdings in Exxon, saying the company had misled the public over <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>&quot;The countries where they operate are going to say you can't do what you're doing and will tax them out of existence or what ever.&quot;</P><P>Exxon says that <mark>climate change</mark> is a &quot;very real&quot; issue for the company but believes the shareholders' resolutions are unnecessary. They say that since 2007 they have included a proxy price for <mark>carbon</mark> in all their forecasts, which essentially means they have been factoring in a likely cost of more restrictive <mark>CO2</mark> policies. </P><P>&quot;I think the 'change or die' comments are a little dramatic, Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers told BBC News.</P><P>&quot;The issue is an important one, <mark>climate change</mark> presents very real risks that need to be managed but so do energy requirements of the modern economy.

I’m sure that it would still be the largest point source of <mark>CO2</mark>, but since <mark>CO2</mark> emissions have grown faster than projected in 1989, it would probably account for a smaller fraction of global <mark>CO2</mark> emissions,” Bernstein wrote.</P><P>The email was written in response to an inquiry on business ethics from the Institute for Applied and Professional Ethics at Ohio University.</P><P>“What it shows is that Exxon knew years earlier than James Hansen’s testimony to Congress that <mark>climate change</mark> was a reality; that it accepted the reality, instead of denying the reality as they have done publicly, and to such an extent that it took it into account in their decision making, in making their economic calculation,” the director of the institute, Alyssa Bernstein (no relation), told the Guardian.</P><P>“One thing that occurs to me is the behavior of the tobacco companies denying the connection between smoking and lung cancer for the sake of profits, but this is an order of magnitude greater moral offence, in my opinion, because what is at stake is the fate of the planet, humanity, and the future of civilisation, not to be melodramatic.”</P><P>Bernstein’s response, first posted on the institute’s website last October, was released by the Union of Concerned Scientists on Wednesday as part of a report on <mark>climate</mark> disinformation promoted by companies such as ExxonMobil, BP, Shell and Peabody Energy, <A href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ucs-documents/global-warming/<mark>Climate</mark>-Deception-Dossiers_All.pdf"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">called the <mark>Climate</mark> Deception Dossiers</A>.</P><P>Asked about Bernstein’s comments, Exxon said <mark>climate</mark> science in the early 1980s was at a preliminary stage, but the company now saw <mark>climate change</mark> as a risk.</P><ASIDE class=""element element-pullquote""><BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""pullquote-paragraph"">The science in 1981 on this subject was in the very, very early days and there was considerable division of opinion</P><FOOTER><CITE class=""pullquote-cite"">Richard Keil, Exxon spokesman</CITE></FOOTER></BLOCKQUOTE></ASIDE><P>“The science in 1981 on this subject was in the very, very early days and there was considerable division of opinion,” Richard Keil, an Exxon spokesman, said. “There was nobody you could have gone to in 1981 or 1984 who would have said whether it was real or not. Nobody could provide a definitive answer.”</P><P>He rejected the idea that Exxon had funded groups promoting <mark>climate</mark> denial. “I am here to talk to you about the present,” he said. “We have been factoring the likelihood of some kind of <mark>carbon</mark> tax into our business planning since 2007. We do not fund or support those who deny the reality of <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>Exxon, unlike other companies and the public at large in the early 1980s, was already aware of <mark>climate change</mark> – and the prospect of regulations to limit the greenhouse gas emissions that cause <mark>climate change</mark>, according to Bernstein’s account.</P><P>“In the 1980s, Exxon needed to understand the potential for concerns about <mark>climate change</mark> to lead to regulation that would affect Natuna and other potential projects. They were well ahead of the rest of industry in this awareness. Other companies, such as Mobil, only became aware of the issue in 1988, when it first became a political issue,” he wrote.</P><P>“Natural resource companies – oil, coal, minerals – have to make investments that have lifetimes of 50-100 years. Whatever their public stance, internally they make very careful assessments of the potential for regulation, including the scientific basis for those regulations,” Bernstein wrote in the email.</P><P>Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard University professor who researches the history of <mark>climate</mark> science, said it was unsurprising Exxon would have factored <mark>climate change</mark> in its plans in the early 1980s – but she disputed Bernstein’s suggestion that other companies were not. She also took issue with Exxon’s assertion of uncertainty about the science in the 1980s, noting the National Academy of Science describing a consensus on <mark>climate change</mark> from the 1970s.</P><P>The White House and the National Academy of Sciences came out with reports on <mark>climate change</mark> in the 1970s, and government scientific agencies were studying <mark>climate change</mark> in the 1960s, she said. There were also a number of major scientific meetings on <mark>climate change</mark> in the 1970s.</P><P>“I find it difficult to believe that an industry whose business model depends on fossil fuels could have been completely ignoring major environmental reports, major environmental meetings taken place in which <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and <mark>climate change</mark> were talked about,” she said in an interview with the Guardian. </P><P>The East Natuna gas field, about 140 miles north-east of the Natuna islands in the South China Sea and 700 miles north of Jakarta, is the biggest in south-east Asia, with about 46tn cubic ft (1.3tn cubic metres) of recoverable reserves.</P><P>However, Exxon did not go into production on the field.</P><ASIDE class=""element element-pullquote""><BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""pullquote-paragraph"">Corporations are interested in environmental impacts only to the extent that they affect profits</P><FOOTER><CITE class=""pullquote-cite"">Lenny Bernstein</CITE></FOOTER></BLOCKQUOTE></ASIDE><P>Bernstein writes in his email to Ohio University: “Corporations are interested in environmental impacts only to the extent that they affect profits, either current or future.

Feel free to share this e-mail with her. Corporations are interested in environmental impacts only to the extent that they affect profits, either current or future. They may take what appears to be altruistic positions to improve their public image, but the assumption underlying those actions is that they will increase future profits. ExxonMobil is an interesting case in point.</P><P>Exxon first got interested in <mark>climate change</mark> in 1981 because it was seeking to develop the Natuna gas field off Indonesia. This is an immense reserve of natural gas, but it is 70% <mark>CO2</mark>. That <mark>CO2</mark> would have to be separated to make the natural gas usable. Natural gas often contains <mark>CO2</mark> and the technology for removing <mark>CO2</mark> is well known. In 1981 (and now) the usual practice was to vent the <mark>CO2</mark> to the atmosphere. When I first learned about the project in 1989, the projections were that if Natuna were developed and its <mark>CO2</mark> vented to the atmosphere, it would be the largest point source of <mark>CO2</mark> in the world and account for about 1% of projected global <mark>CO2</mark> emissions. I’m sure that it would still be the largest point source of <mark>CO2</mark>, but since <mark>CO2</mark> emissions have grown faster than projected in 1989, it would probably account for a smaller fraction of global <mark>CO2</mark> emissions.</P><P>The alternative to venting <mark>CO2</mark> to the atmosphere is to inject it into ground. This technology was also well known, since the oil industry had been injecting limited quantities of <mark>CO2</mark> to enhance oil recovery. There were many questions about whether the <mark>CO2</mark> would remain in the ground, some of which have been answered by Statoil’s now almost 20 years of experience injecting <mark>CO2</mark> in the North Sea. Statoil did this because the Norwegian government placed a tax on vented <mark>CO2</mark>. It was cheaper for Statoil to inject <mark>CO2</mark> than pay the tax. Of course, Statoil has touted how much <mark>CO2</mark> it has prevented from being emitted.</P><P>In the 1980s, Exxon needed to understand the potential for concerns about <mark>climate change</mark> to lead to regulation that would affect Natuna and other potential projects. They were well ahead of the rest of industry in this awareness. Other companies, such as Mobil, only became aware of the issue in 1988, when it first became a political issue. Natural resource companies – oil, coal, minerals – have to make investments that have lifetimes of 50-100 years. Whatever their public stance, internally they make very careful assessments of the potential for regulation, including the scientific basis for those regulations. Exxon NEVER denied the potential for humans to impact the <mark>climate</mark> system. It did question – legitimately, in my opinion – the validity of some of the science.</P><P>Political battles need to personify the enemy. This is why liberals spend so much time vilifying the Koch brothers – who are hardly the only big money supporters of conservative ideas. In <mark>climate change</mark>, the first villain was a man named Donald Pearlman, who was a lobbyist for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. (In another life, he was instrumental in getting the US Holocaust Museum funded and built.) Pearlman’s usefulness as a villain ended when he died of lung cancer – he was a heavy smoker to the end.</P><P>Then the villain was the Global <mark>Climate</mark> Coalition (GCC), a trade organization of energy producers and large energy users. I was involved in GCC for a while, unsuccessfully trying to get them to recognize scientific reality. (That effort got me on to the front page of the New York Times, but that’s another story.) Environmental group pressure was successful in putting GCC out of business, but they also lost their villain. They needed one which wouldn’t die and wouldn’t go out of business. Exxon, and after its merger with Mobil ExxonMobil, fit the bill, especially under its former CEO, Lee Raymond, who was vocally opposed to <mark>climate change</mark> regulation. ExxonMobil’s current CEO, Rex Tillerson, has taken a much softer line, but ExxonMobil has not lost its position as the personification of corporate, and especially <mark>climate change</mark>, evil. It is the only company mentioned in Alyssa’s e-mail, even though, in my opinion, it is far more ethical that many other large corporations.</P><P>Having spent twenty years working for Exxon and ten working for Mobil, I know that much of that ethical behavior comes from a business calculation that it is cheaper in the long run to be ethical than unethical. Safety is the clearest example of this. ExxonMobil knows all too well the cost of poor safety practices. The Exxon Valdez is the most public, but far from the only, example of the high cost of unsafe operations. The value of good environmental practices are more subtle, but a facility that does a good job of controlling emission and waste is a well run facility, that is probably maximizing profit. All major companies will tell you that they are trying to minimize their internal <mark>CO2</mark> emissions. Mostly, they are doing this by improving energy efficiency and reducing cost. The same is true for internal recycling, again a practice most companies follow. Its [sic] just good engineering.</P><P>I could go on, but this e-mail is long enough.</P></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE><DIV class=""submeta""><SPAN class=""submeta__label"">Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Exxon’s history has been the subject of recent reporting by Inside <mark>Climate</mark> News, The Los Angeles Times and others.</P><P>The reporting has alleged the company misled the public about what its own scientists found about the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> and greenhouse gases.</P><P>Here is a clip of a video produced by PBS’ Frontline in collaboration with Inside <mark>Climate</mark> News, a not-for-profit journalism organization that covers energy and the environment.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>MAN:</STRONG></P><P> Proponents of the global warming theory say that higher levels of greenhouse gases are causing world temperatures to rise and that burning fossil fuels is the reason.</P><P>The scientific evidence remains inconclusive as to whether human activities affect the global <mark>climate</mark>.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>WOMAN:</STRONG></P><P> We found a trail of documents that that go back to 1977.</P><P>Exxon knew <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide was increasing in the atmosphere, that combustion of fossil fuels was driving it, and that this posed a threat to Exxon.

They were compared to Bell Labs as being at the leadership of doing good scientific work. And then they changed tactics for some reason, and their numerous statements over the last 20 years or so that question <mark>climate change</mark>, whether it’s happening, that claim that there is no competent model for <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>So we’re very interested in seeing what science Exxon has been using for its own purposes, because they’re tremendously active in offshore oil drilling in the Arctic, for example, where global warming is happening at a much more rapid rate than in more temperate zones. Were they using the best science and the most competent models for their own purposes, but then telling the public, the regulators and shareholders that no competent models existed?</P><P>Things like that. We’re interested in what they were using internally and what they were telling the world.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>JUDY WOODRUFF:</STRONG></P><P> And what law would be violated by doing this?</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN:</STRONG></P><P> Well, in New York, we have laws against defrauding the public, defrauding consumers, defrauding shareholders.</P><P>We’re at the beginning of the investigation. We have to see what documents are in there, but certainly all of the claims would lie in some form of fraud.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>JUDY WOODRUFF:</STRONG></P><P> Well, I’m sure you’re not surprised to know Exxon is categorically denying this. The CEO, Rex Tillerson, said this week nothing could be further from the truth.</P><P>In the company’s written statement, they start out by saying for many years, they have included all the information they have about the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> in their public filings, in their reports to shareholders.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN:</STRONG></P><P> We know that they have been issuing public statements that are at odds with that, and that they have been funding organizations that are even more aggressive <mark>climate change</mark> deniers.</P><P>And they have made numerous statements, both Exxon officials and in Exxon reports, but also through these organizations they fund, like the American Enterprise Institute, ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council, through their activities with the American Petroleum Institute, so directly and through other organizations, Exxon has said a lot of things that conflict with the statement that they have always been forthcoming about the realities of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>JUDY WOODRUFF:</STRONG></P><P> Well, let me read you, Attorney General Schneiderman, something else that Exxon has been saying where they reacted to some of the reporting that was done on this which is similar to what you’re describing.</P><P>They say these are allegations based on what they call deliberately cherry-picked statements attributed to various ExxonMobil employees to wrongly suggest that conclusions were reached decades ago by researchers. He said they were statements taken completely out of context and ignored other available statements at the same time.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN:</STRONG></P><P> Well, then they should welcome this investigation, because, unlike journalists, my staff is going to get to read all of the documents in context, and they will have an opportunity to explain the context of the statements and whether there are contradictions or not.</P><P>So, we’re at the very beginning stages. We don’t want to prejudge what we’re going to find, but the public record is troubling enough that we brought — that we decided we had to bring this investigation.</P><P>Another area that — where they have been active and we’re concerned about is overestimating the costs of switching to renewable energy. They have issued reports, one as recently as last year in response to shareholder requests and public requests, estimating that switching over to renewables by the end of this century would raise energy costs, to the point that they would cost — they would be 44 percent of the median income of an American family.</P><P>We want to see how they arrived at that conclusion, which we believe to be vastly overstated.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>JUDY WOODRUFF:</STRONG></P><P> How do you draw a line between ExxonMobil doing research and talking openly about the debate out there about what is known about <mark>climate change</mark>, and on the other hand advocating for policies that they think are going to be better for their own bottom line?</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN:</STRONG></P><P> Well, there’s nothing wrong with advocating for your own company.</P><P>What you’re not allowed to do is commit fraud. You’re not allowed to have the best <mark>climate change</mark> science that you’re using to build — in your planning of offshore oil towers in the Arctic, where you have to take into account rising sea levels and the melting of the permafrost and things like that. If you’re using that internally, but what you’re putting out to the world, directly and through these <mark>climate</mark> denial organizations, is completely in conflict with that, that’s not OK.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>JUDY WOODRUFF:</STRONG></P><P> New York State Attorney General Eric Schmitt, we thank you.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN:</STRONG></P><P> Thank you.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>JUDY WOODRUFF:</STRONG></P><P> And joining me now is Kenneth Cohen. He is vice president for public and government affairs with ExxonMobil Corporation.</P><P>Kenneth Cohen, welcome.</P><P>Let me just begin by asking flat out, has Exxon in any way misled or been dishonest with the public about what it knows about <mark>climate change</mark>?</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>KENNETH COHEN, Vice President of Public &amp; Government Affairs, <mark>Exxon Mobil Corpo</mark>ration:</STRONG></P><P> Well, Judy, first, thank you for the invitation to come on tonight’s program.</P><P>And I also appreciate opening with that question, because the answer is a simple no. And what the facts will show is that the company has been engaged for many decades in a two-pronged activity here.</P><P>First, we take the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> seriously. And we also have been working to understand the science of <mark>climate change</mark>. And that activity started in the late ’70s and has continued up to the present time. Our scientists have produced over 150 papers, 50 of which have been part of peer-reviewed publications.</P><P>Our scientists participate in the U.N.’s <mark>climate</mark> body. We have been participating in the U.N. activities beginning in 1988, running through the present time. At the same time, we have also been engaged in discussions on policy.</P><P>And in the discussions on policy, for example, in the late ’90s, we were part of a large business coalition that opposed adoption in the U.S. of the Kyoto protocol. Now, why did we do that? We opposed the Kyoto protocol because it would have exempted from its application over two-thirds of the world’s emitters. Think about that. And that was in 1997.</P><P>Going forward, if that policy were in effect today, it would have excluded almost 80 percent of the world’s emissions. So that wasn’t a good policy approach.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>JUDY WOODRUFF:</STRONG></P><P> Well, let me ask you about one of the points that the attorney general made. He said Exxon over the last few decades, in his words, has shifted tactics, from taking <mark>climate change</mark> seriously, engaging in serious research, to, he said, much more recently questioning whether it’s happening at all.</P><P>Is that an accurate, a fair description of the shift that’s taken place?</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>KENNETH COHEN:</STRONG></P><P> No, it’s not. And the facts are as follows.</P><P>We have endeavored with — to understand the science of this very complex subject, as I mentioned, beginning in the ’70s and running to the present time. This is a very complex area. This is a very complex system, <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>What we discovered, what our scientists discovered, working in conjunction with the U.S. government, with the Department of Energy, working in conjunction with some of the leading research institutions around the world in the ’70s and the ’80s, was that the tools available the science to get a handle on the risk, these tools needed to develop, and we, for example, were part of developing, working with others, some of the complex modeling that is used today.</P><P>And, today, that work continues. Now, on the policy side, we have to remember that ExxonMobil is a large energy provider, one of the world’s largest energy companies. We have a two-pronged challenge in front of us. We produce energy that the modern world runs on.</P><P>And what we strive to do is produce that energy while at the same time reducing the environmental footprint associated with our operations and, most importantly, with consumers’ use of the energy.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>JUDY WOODRUFF:</STRONG></P><P> And I think people understand that, but I think what is striking was his — was the attorney general’s comment that Exxon — what he’s concerned about and wants to know is whether Exxon was using one set of scientific models to do its work in the Arctic, for example, where Exxon has been engaged in drilling, and on the other hand telling the public, telling its shareholders a very different set of facts about the state of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>KENNETH COHEN:</STRONG></P><P> Well, the facts will show that the company has been engaged with, not only on our own, but with — in conjunction with some of the leading researchers.</P><P>Our view of this very complex subject over the years, over the decades has mirrored that of the broader scientific community. That is to say, the discussions that have taken place inside our company, among our scientists mirror the discussions that have been taking place and the work that’s been taking place by the broader scientific community.</P><P>That’s what the facts will show.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>JUDY WOODRUFF:</STRONG></P><P> Just final question. He made a point of saying that Exxon has funded a number of organizations that he said that have been openly <mark>climate change</mark> deniers. He mentioned the American Enterprise Institute. He mentioned the American Petroleum Institute and the American Legislative Exchange.</P><P>Has Exxon been funding these organizations?</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>KENNETH COHEN:</STRONG></P><P> Well, the answer is yes. And I will let those organizations respond for themselves.</P><P>But I will tell you that what we have been engaged in, both — we have been focused on understanding the science, participating with the broader scientific community in developing the science, while at the same time participating in understanding what would be and working with policy-makers on what would be appropriate policy responses to this evolving body of science.</P><P>That’s why we were involved with large business coalitions challenging the adoption of the Kyoto protocol in the United States. And we then moved to oppose, for example, early adoption of cap-and-trade approaches in the U.S. One of the earlier approaches in the last decade would have exempted, for example, coal from its operations.</P><P>So we favor the adoption — policy-makers should consider policy and should adopt policy.

Yet it passed, with 62 percent of shareholders voting “yes” on the call for a “2-degree scenario” analysis, which, as 195 countries have agreed to under the 2016 Paris Agreement, seeks to prevent the Earth from heating up by more than 2 degrees Celsius since the start of the industrial age. (So far, it’s up about 1.1 degrees Celsius.)</P><P>Asset managers Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street represent ExxonMobil’s three largest shareholders, with roughly 7, 6, and 5 percent of shares outstanding, respectively.</P><P>Almost every investor has heard of Vanguard, the Malvern-based, $4 trillion indexing powerhouse founded by John Bogle, an advocate for low-fee investing. According to Bloomberg data, Vanguard owns 299 million shares of ExxonMobil.</P><P>Fewer have likely heard of Sister Nora. She’s no ordinary nun — she is director of corporate responsibility for the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia.</P><P><FIGURE id=""attachment_15506"" style=""width: 309px;"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Sister Nora Nash, of the Aston-based Sisters of St. Francis, helped propose a <mark>climate</mark>-change shareholder proposal at ExxonMobil that passed on Wednesday. The nuns own 5,900 shares in their retirement fund. The largest institutional shareholder is Vanguard, with 299 million shares. (INTERFAITH CENTER ON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY)</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></P><P>The religious order, based in Aston, Delaware County, owns about 5,900 ExxonMobil shares in its retirement fund. The sisters also own Chevron, Anadarko, Chesapeake Energy, Southern Co., and Marathon Oil shares.</P><P>“We know the oil and gas industry isn’t going away, but we’re putting a lot of pressure on them,” Sister Nora said in an interview. “They have been extremely slow to recognize the 2-degree scenario coming from the Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord. If we don’t stay below 2 degrees, our world will be more troubled because of greenhouse-gas emissions.”</P><P>Vanguard reportedly had been considering voting for the <mark>climate</mark>-change resolution, but on Wednesday declined to comment on how it voted. At past shareholders meetings, Vanguard generally votes with ExxonMobil management, but has sometimes voted against.</P><P>Faith-based shareholders said Blackrock and Vanguard likely voted for the proposal.</P><P>“The vote was 38.1 percent last year for the same proposal, and 62.3 percent this year,” said Christina Cobourn Herman of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), an activist group of asset managers and religious leaders who advocate responsible investing and corporate governance.</P><P>Together, Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street own 18 percent of ExxonMobil. “I don’t know how we could have gotten that vote level without all three of these large funds, unless there are other very large shareholders out there that we aren’t aware of,” she said.</P><P>It was Sister Nora and those faith-based investors who put forth the <mark>climate</mark>-change resolution. Her religious order is a member of the ICCR.</P><P>Wednesday’s shareholders meeting in Dallas was the first for ExxonMobil’s new CEO, Darren Woods, as head of the company. Woods took over at the start of the year after longtime chief executive Rex Tillerson retired to serve as President Trump’s secretary of state.</P><P>In remarks to the shareholders, Woods said, “We must also be mindful of the environment. We expect global <mark>CO2</mark> emissions to peak and gradually decline by 2035.”</P><P>Prior to the meeting, Woods wrote a letter to the president, urging him to keep the United States in the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement. Reports out of Washington on Wednesday suggested that Trump is leaning toward pulling the United States out of the accord.</P><P>“I want to thank you for writing that letter, and it’s for this reason I’m very grateful,” Sister Pat Daly, of the Dominican Sisters of Caldwell, N.J., told Woods. She is executive director of the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investments, which comprises 40 Catholic institutions, mostly congregations of sisters and priests, who assist investors in engaging with companies, educating their members, and connecting investment activity with Catholic social teaching.</P><P>In response, Woods said: “The Paris framework involves countries all around the world, and it’s very important.”</P><P>This isn’t the first time Sister Nora has tangled with a Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 corporate giant. She and the Sisters of St. Francis are invested in Wells Fargo, and as part of Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, they condemned the bank and demanded a deeper investigation into the bank’s cross-selling activities in October. As the Wells Fargo scandal involving the opening of two million accounts by retail banking employees without customers’ knowledge unfolded, the ICCR passed resolutions expressing disappointment in the bank.</P><P>“At our meeting with Wells representatives last December, we pressed for disclosure and we were denied the truth,” Sister Nora said in a news release from ICCR last year. “We are confronted with painful accounts of fraud including some 80,000 customers in Pennsylvania alone. As shareholders and customers ourselves, we feel betrayed and have no choice but to call for a full review of business standards through this resolution, which we hope other shareholders will support.”</P><P>Though environmentalists declared the ExxonMobil vote a victory, “it is nonbinding,” noted Dan Wiener, a longtime Vanguard investor and  Brooklyn-based publisher of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors newsletter. “This is a safe vote for all the institutional investors like BlackRock and Vanguard, since it doesn’t do very much.”</P><DIV class=""pad-and-half--top cb""><DIV class=""shirttail font--primary font--ml space--btm pad--top pad--btm border--top border--btm""><DIV class=""unify article-meta__text pad-half--left"" id=""timestamp-published""><STRONG>Published:</STRONG><TIME class=""date space-half--right gray"" datetime=""Wed May 31 17:20:00 PDT 2017"" pubdate=""""> May 31, 2017 — 8:20 PM EDT</TIME></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN><FOOTER class=""article-recirc article--pad space-and-half--btm""><DIV class=""section__header sf__header bg--slate space-and-half--btm""><DIV class=""lc""><DIV class=""page--pad""><H3 class=""upper white font--ml pad-half--top pad-half--btm"">More in business</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></BODY></HTML>"

The Competitive Enterprise Institute, whose website says it opposes U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, had also sought the documents.</P><P>&quot;This is far less a proper common interest agreement than a sweeping cloak of secrecy,&quot; said Chris Horner, a lawyer who represents the Energy &amp; Environment Legal Institute.</P><P>The attorneys general, as previously reported, received guidance from well-known <mark>climate</mark> scientists and environmental lawyers before announcing the Exxon probe.</P><P>Critics have called this a sign of meddling by special interests, though prosecutors' offices have made clear <mark>climate change</mark> is a top concern of voters.</P><P>New York state's attorney's general office said confidentiality agreements are used often.</P><P>&quot;Entering into a common interest agreement is routine practice during a multistate investigation.

It has also said it is being unfairly targeted by <mark>climate</mark> activists.</P><P>The company, which supports a revenue-neutral <mark>carbon</mark> tax, declined to comment.</P><P>A U.S. House of Representatives committee last month issued subpoenas to the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts over their investigations of whether Exxon misled investors on <mark>climate change</mark> risks. The two state officials said they would refuse to comply with the subpoenas, with one calling it &quot;unconstitutional and unwarranted&quot; interference.</P><P>In a bid to try to force action on <mark>climate change</mark>, the state attorneys general said in March they would jointly investigate whether Exxon executives misled the public by contradicting research from company scientists that spelled out the threats of global warming.</P><P>A pact was signed in May and included California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington state and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</P><P>But only a couple formal inquiries have started.

Schneiderman has also targeted the company. A lawsuit he filed in June 2017 accuses Exxon Mobil of committing fraud and inflating its stock price by <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/business/energy-environment/exxon-mobil-<mark>climate</mark>-change-lawsuit.html?_r=0"">keeping two sets of books</A>.</P><P>Schneiderman alleges that one set of books, made public, is predicated on there being little risk that <mark>climate</mark> policies would interfere with the company’s future ability to profit from its investments in oil and gas projects. The other alleged set of books, kept hidden, accounts for those policies leading it to <A href=""http://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=17-P13-00024&amp;segmentID=3"">earn less money</A>, according to court filings.</P><P>Based on my research on how <mark>climate change</mark> affects corporate accounting, I also suspect that Exxon determined that disclosing its <mark>climate</mark>-related risks would help all of its shareholders and other stakeholders such as lenders, suppliers and consumers.</P><P>Ample research, including my own on the <A href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278425413000033""><mark>climate</mark>-related information <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> companies voluntarily disclose</A>, indicates that stock prices rise when outside investors have — or anticipate getting — more accurate information about plans and strategies to manage <mark>climate change</mark> risk.</P><H3>Behind the Curve</H3><P>On top of bowing to demands from investors, Exxon Mobil needed to catch up with its competitors.</P><P><A href=""http://www.conocophillips.com/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-change/<mark>climate</mark>-change-strategy/<mark>carbon</mark>-scenarios/"">ConocoPhillips</A>, <A href=""http://www.shell.com/sustainability/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-change.html"">Shell</A>, <A href=""https://www.total.com/en/commitment/environmental-issues-challenges/<mark>climate</mark>-change?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyNytjoyL2AIVkl5-Ch0RMQ4QEAAYASAAEgJTxPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"">Total</A>, <A href=""https://www.statoil.com/en/how-and-why/<mark>climate</mark>-change.html"">Statoil</A> and <A href=""https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/energy-outlook/a-lower-<mark>carbon</mark>-world.html""><SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN></A> already assess and report on their <mark>climate</mark> risks, along the lines of how Exxon Mobil plans to undertake this task.</P><P>In short, Exxon Mobil’s executives may have realized that not disclosing risks that its peers already acknowledge would potentially hurt its stock price more than airing the information.</P><P>Had it not bowed to pressure to start disclosing its <mark>climate</mark> risks, investors could have construed that Exxon Mobil has something to hide, whether true or not.</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""twitter-tweet"" data-lang=""en""><P dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"" xml:lang=""en"">Exxon's recent announcement that it will report on <A href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/<mark>climate</mark>risk?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#<mark>climate</mark>risk</A> shows the impact of collaborative investor engagement. <A href=""https://t.co/VjXYiASAvz"">https://t.co/VjXYiASAvz</A></P>

This is already happening: Exxon Mobil wrote off a $16 billion investment in Canadian tar sands in early 2017 due to the project’s high cost per barrel of oil.</P><P>However, shareholders could lose money if the company ends up revealing proprietary information that aids its competitors when it discloses its <mark>climate</mark>-related risks.</P><P>I believe Exxon Mobil has resolved to disclose more of these risks because it judges that it has more to gain by reporting on its <mark>climate</mark> plans than it stands to lose by not becoming more open.</P><H3>Voluntary Yet Consistent</H3><P>In an earlier article I wrote for <A href=""https://theconversation.com/should-oil-companies-like-exxon-be-forced-to-disclose-<mark>climate</mark>-change-risks-66961"">The Conversation</A> with energy and sustainability expert <A href=""https://www.cfr.org/experts/amy-myers-jaffe"">Amy Myers Jaffe</A>, we urged the <SPAN class=""caps"">SEC</SPAN> to establish a voluntary disclosure program for major oil and gas corporations. We proposed that the <SPAN class=""caps"">SEC</SPAN> establish a common framework for reporting on <mark>climate change</mark> risks and that it use its moral authority and enforcement powers to encourage full compliance.</P><P>This approach would bring about a steady and predictable flow of consistent and comparable information on <mark>climate change</mark> policies and outcomes. Currently, all companies are essentially on their own to disclose whatever they please whenever they feel ready to do it.</P><P>This is not always helpful for markets. When companies disclose information that investors and analysts cannot easily compare it is costly and unwieldy for them to cross-reference it.</P><P>In a recent paper, presented at the Journal of Corporate Finance <A href=""/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b9d1cdcdc9839696cecece97d8df97c9d6d5c0cc97dcddcc97d1d296dad6d7dfdccbdcd7dadce6c9d8dedcca96dddccdd8d0d5968e89"">conference on sustainability</A>, <A href=""https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/estelle-yuan-sun/"">Estelle Sun</A> at Boston University, <A href=""https://www.uakron.edu/cba/about-us/directory/profile-detail.dot?u=tneururer"">Thaddeus Neururer</A> at the University of Akron and I show that when the cost of processing environmental information increases, analysts lose interest in dealing with it.</P><P>This means analysts issue fewer and less timely reports, to the detriment of outside investors and others, who are deprived of market prices reflecting the most up-to-date data and information.</P><P>In short, the public cannot rely only on the private sector to provide consistent and comparable information regarding the effects of businesses on <mark>climate</mark> change.</P><P>Even with Exxon Mobil’s about-face, I still believe the <SPAN class=""caps"">SEC</SPAN> needs to create a voluntary disclosure program to correct the private sector’s failure to establish a common standard for comparing <mark>climate change</mark> data as soon as possible.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">Senator Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, urged former Exxon Mobil <SPAN class=""caps"">CEO</SPAN> Rex Tillerson to discuss the company’s <mark>climate</mark> track record during a confirmation hearing for the Trump administration’s secretary of State.</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P><EM>This article was originally published on <A href=""https://theconversation.com"">The Conversation</A>.

The attorneys general previously filed motions to dismiss based on the absence of a ripe injury or the Colorado River abstention doctrine. The Massachusetts attorney general also argued that a Massachusetts state court decision  precluded Exxon’s claims and that the court lacked personal jurisdiction. At a hearing on November 30, 2017, the district court requested that the attorneys general update their briefing on dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) (previously brief in Texas federal court) to reference Second Circuit law. In its supplemental filing, the New York attorney general argued that Exxon’s claim that the investigation was an attempt to “suppress Exxon’s corporate viewpoint on <mark>climate change</mark>, in violation of the First Amendment,” was not plausible. The New York attorney general also argued that Exxon’s claims that the attorney general’s subpoena called for an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment and violated the dormant Commerce Clause were without merit. In addition, the attorney general contended that Exxon’s allegations of “political bias” did not support a procedural due process claim, that Exxon’s claim that a Securities and Exchange Commission rule preempted the investigation was premature, and that the court was without jurisdiction to hear state law claims. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>08/03/2017</TD><TD>Letter submitted by Exxon in response to Attorney General Healey's August 1, 2017 letter.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>08/01/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20170801_docket-117-cv-02301_letter.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Letter filed by Massachusetts attorney general.</TD><TD>In a letter to the court, the Massachusetts attorney general's office contended that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>casechart.com/case/in-re-civil-investigative-demand-no-2016-epd-36/"">taking Exxon's appeal</A> of the trial court's order requiring it to comply with the civil investigative demand provided additional support for abstention by the federal court.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>06/30/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20170630_docket-117-cv-02301_reply-2.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Reply filed by Massachusetts attorney general in support of motion to dismiss.</TD><TD><STRONG>Briefing Completed on Motions by Attorneys General to Dismiss Exxon Federal Lawsuit.</STRONG> Briefing was completed for the motions by the Massachusetts and New York attorneys general to dismiss <mark>Exxon Mobil Corpo</mark>ration’s (Exxon’s) action in New York federal court to block the states’ investigation of its <mark>climate change</mark>-related disclosures.

The court also ordered the dismissal without prejudice of the attorneys’ general pending motions to dismiss and set a schedule for renewal of the motions. Briefing on the motions was to be completed by June 30, 2017. The order authorized the attorneys general to seek dismissal on the grounds of personal jurisdiction, ripeness, abstention pursuant to the Colorado River doctrine (which may apply where there are concurrent federal and state lawsuits pending), and collateral estoppel and res judicata. The court did not authorize the defendants to seek dismissal based on Younger abstention—the abstention doctrine on which the attorneys general primarily had relied in their motions before the Texas federal court. (Younger abstention applies when ongoing state judicial proceedings implicate important state interests and provide adequate opportunity to raise constitutional challenges.) Expressing concern that the attorneys general had commenced their investigations in bad faith, the Texas federal court had ordered discovery into the motivations of the attorneys general to determine whether the “bad faith” exception to Younger abstention applied. The New York court’s order followed a status conference held on April 21, at which the judge reportedly stated that she had a “<A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/21042017/exxon-mobil-<mark>climate</mark>-change-scandal-fraud-investigations-new-york-schneiderman"">different view</A>” of the case than the Texas judge.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/20/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20170420_docket-117-cv-02301_amicus-brief.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Amicus brief filed by states in support of plaintiff's request to lift the stay of discover and in opposition to defendants' requests for dismissal.</TD><TD>One day before a status conference, the attorneys general from Texas and 10 other states sought permission to file an amicus brief in support of Exxon.

Echoing the concerns raised by the Texas federal district court, the 11 attorneys general argued that abstention under the Younger doctrine was not warranted because the defendants had commenced their investigations in bad faith.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/20/2017</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Yet Exxon publicly represented that none of its assets were 'stranded' because the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>, if any, were uncertain and far off in the future.&quot;</P><P>Exxon did not respond to a request to comment. Lawyers representing the shareholders also did not respond to calls for comment.</P><P>Exxon is the world's largest publicly traded company, reporting $1.7 billion in profits the second quarter of this year. According to figures cited in the lawsuit, the value of Exxon stock dropped 13 percent from $95 a share in mid-July to $82.54 in late September and was $85.31 as of Friday.</P><P>The lawsuit, which could include hundreds of thousands of investors, seeks unspecified damages to reimburse stockholders for their losses and holds open the option for a judge to bar Exxon from the practices that led to the lawsuit.</P><P>These allegations of violations of the federal Securities Exchange Act by company officials add to Exxon's legal woes as the company faces fraud investigations by the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts.</P><P>The two investigations are being conducted under the states' consumer protection laws to determine whether Exxon deceived consumers and investors about the role of its products in contributing to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The class-action suit alleges that Exxon breached its fiduciary responsibility to investors, but the legal bar remains high to prove the company intentionally deceived them.</P><P>Holding a company legally accountable requires proof that it failed to act responsibly based on its evolving assessments of <mark>climate</mark> risks, legal experts said.</P><P>The investors who filed suit purchased Exxon stock between February and October. They claim the company was aware of the connection between burning fossil fuels and <mark>climate change</mark> for decades, and understood that coming regulations could restrict development of some hydro<mark>carbon</mark> reserves, according to the lawsuit filed in the Northern District of Texas.</P><P>Yet the company continued to file disclosure statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the federal regulatory agency that polices stock sales, saying everything was fine, the lawsuit said.</P><P>Exxon's public statements—submitted to the SEC under the assurance of accuracy—that investors rely on when deciding whether to buy stock were &quot;materially false and misleading&quot; because they failed to disclose a number of factors, according to the lawsuit.</P><P>The<A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/21092016/exxon-sec-questions-financial-risks-<mark>climate</mark>-change-eric-schneiderman-ny""> SEC also has reportedly opened an investigation</A> into Exxon to determine whether the company has been forthcoming with investors about <mark>climate</mark> risks and accounting issues concerning its reserves.</P><P>Among the cautionary signs that Exxon concealed from investors was the company's own internal reports from the 1970s concerning <mark>climate change</mark>, which recognized the environmental risks caused by global warming, according to the lawsuit.</P><P>&quot;Given the risks associated with global warming and <mark>climate change</mark>, the Company would not be able to extract the existing hydro<mark>carbon</mark> reserves Exxon claimed to have,&quot; according to the lawsuit.</P><P>As a result, the suit says, a significant portion of Exxon's reserves should already have been written down; that's a bookkeeping function that reduces the value of an asset because it has been overvalued.</P><P>Key to the complaint is the allegation that Exxon's continued assertion that the company was on solid ground despite internally understating the potential impact of <mark>climate change</mark> resulted in an artificial inflation of stock values. Stock value took a hit <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/04112016/exxon-tar-sands-reserves-<mark>climate</mark>-change-oil"">when the company recently announced that it might be forced to write down</A> nearly 20 percent of its oil and gas reserves, according to the lawsuit. It has since rebounded to roughly the price it was selling for in September.</P><P>&quot;Specifically, the Company acknowledged that it might have to write down 3.6 billion barrels of <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/oil-sands"">oil sand</A> reserves and one billion barrels of other North American reserves that Exxon now conceded were not profitable to produce under current prices,&quot; according to the lawsuit.</P><P>Celia Taylor, a professor of securities and corporate law at the University of Denver, said shareholders will have a much easier task proving Exxon failed to lower the value of its oil reserves than proving it deceived investors about <mark>climate change</mark>'s role in charting the company's future.</P><P>&quot;That is a tangible element—that the company knew the value of the oil in the ground wasn't what they knew it to be and failed to assign the true value to the asset.</P><P>&quot;That is a stronger hook than the <mark>climate change</mark> hook. There would have to be a showing that officers and directors knew <mark>climate change</mark> posed risks and didn't disclose those risks because they knew that would have a negative effect on stock value,&quot; <A href=""http://www.law.du.edu/index.php/profile/celia-taylor"">Taylor</A> said.</P><P>That's a tough task when disclosure requirements lack guidelines on precisely what has to be disclosed specific to <mark>climate change</mark>, she said.</P><P>Ryan McConnell, an adjunct professor of corporate law at the University of Houston Law Center, said class-action lawsuits of this type require proof that a company propped up the price of its stock by not disclosing information that would have influenced the stock value.</P><P>&quot;They have to show causation where information from the company moved the stock price,&quot; he said. &quot;Otherwise how do you know the statements mattered?&quot;</P><P>The next hurdle to overcome in winning a securities fraud case is proving the information related to setting stock prices was intentionally withheld, he said.</P><P>&quot;There is always the debate about what should have been disclosed and when,&quot; <A href=""http://www.rmcconnellgroup.com/team/ryan-mcconnell/"">McConnell</A> said.</P><P>&quot;The fight is always about interpreting what is disclosed and what isn't and what material consequence it had.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""tagged-with""><LABEL>Published Under:</LABEL></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

      <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""mailto:PHayes@bloomberglaw.com"">Peter Hayes</A></I></P><P><mark>Exxon Mobil Corp.</mark>, BP PLC, and Chevron Corp. are some of the oil, coal and gas companies
   that face a new wave of <mark>climate change</mark> litigation. These latest cases are by California
   cities and counties alleging the energy producers’ emissions amount to public nuisances
   under state law.
</P><P>The suits, filed by 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/uP1"">Marin</A> and 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/uP3"">San Mateo</A> counties and the cities of 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/t3h"">San Francisco</A>, 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/t3i"">Oakland</A> and 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/uP2"">Imperial Beach</A>, are expected to be the first of many, as public officials in other states increasingly
   look to the courts, not the federal government, to protect their communities from
   sea level rise, attorneys told Bloomberg Law.
</P><P>Some legal experts said this latest set of suits, sparked in large part by the Trump
   administration’s reversal of <mark>climate change</mark> initiatives, have their basis in state
   law similar to nuisance claims recently upheld in high-profile lead paint litigation.
   
</P><P>The suits’ state-law grounding, they said, makes them significantly different from
   federal <mark>climate change</mark> litigation rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court several years
   ago.
</P><P>Proponents also said advancements in the ability to trace <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and other
   pollutants to a relatively small group of companies could bolster the claims.
</P><P>“We are at the dawn of what is a massive wave of litigation,” said 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://www.ciel.org/about-us/ciel-staff/carroll-muffett-president-and-ceo/"">Carroll Muffett</A>, president and CEO of the Center for International Environmental Law, an environmental
   advocacy organization in Washington. “While it began in California, I don’t think
   it’s going to end there,” he said. 
</P><P>But defense attorneys, while acknowledging that more suits are in the offing, remain
   generally skeptical of the odds of any of the litigation gaining much traction. 
</P><P>The new public nuisance suits amount to “lawless exercises in standardless liability
   that lie beyond the power of courts to adjudicate,” said 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""https://www.dwt.com/people/richardfaulk/""> Richard Faulk</A> with Davis Wright Tremaine
   LLP in Washington. Many courts “have already condemned” such efforts, he said. 
</P><H5>`Wave of the Future’</H5><P><mark>Climate change</mark> public nuisance suits are “the wave of the future,” Professor 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://columbia<mark>climate</mark>law.com/about-us/our-team/michael-burger/"">Michael Burger</A>, executive director of the Sabin Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Law at Columbia Law School
   in New York, told Bloomberg Law.
</P><P>While the companies could be found liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages
   in the California suits, “it’s unlikely that would make a dent in their pocketbooks,”
   Burger said. 
</P><P>More litigation will be required “to put real pressure on industry to get behind significant
   greenhouse gas regulation,” he said. “That doesn’t happen if there are only suits
   in one state.” 
</P><P><A class=""bluenobold"" href=""https://delawarelaw.widener.edu/current-students/faculty-directory/faculty/122""> James May</A>, a professor at Widener University Delaware Law School in Wilmington, Del., agreed
   that the California suits are only the beginning. “I would anticipate there will be filings in other states, regardless of what happens
   in the California cases,” May, who’s co-director of Widener’s Environmental Rights
   Institute, said. 
</P><P>May said he would look to states that have shown an interest in addressing <mark>climate</mark>
   change, including New York, Maine, Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington, as likely
   locations for upcoming litigation. 
</P><P>“The potential significance of these cases is huge,” May said “It sounds dramatic,
   but the world is watching.” 
</P><P>San Francisco and Oakland, represented by Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP in Seattle,
   Berkeley, Calif., and Newton Centre, Mass., filed their suits in September.
</P><P>Those suits came on the heels of the San Mateo, Marin and Imperial Beach claims filed
   in July by Sher Edling LLP in San Francisco. 
</P><H5>Trump Effect</H5><P>The latest suits are driven by a number of factors, including the Trump administration’s
   retreat from efforts to combat <mark>climate change</mark> such as withdrawal from the Paris accord,
   a premise even some defense attorneys agree with. 
</P><P>“We have a tone deaf administration that rejects <mark>climate change</mark>,” defense attorney
   William Ruskin with the Law Office of 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""https://wruskinlaw.com"">William A. Ruskin</A>, PLLC in Rye Brook, N.Y., told Bloomberg Law. “In frustration, people are turning
   to the courts.” 
</P><P>Burger agreed that the political <mark>climate</mark> is a factor driving the litigation. </P><P>“The obvious answer is the election of Trump ground <mark>climate change</mark> action to a halt,”
   Burger said. 
</P><P>“We are seeing the federal government abdicate its responsibility,” he said. “When
   there’s a large regulatory gap, one way to fill it is through litigation.” 
</P><P> May said the failure to address <mark>climate change</mark> in the U.S. outside of the courtroom
   leaves few alternatives to litigation. 
</P><P>“The politically blue states have taken action, but that can only go so far,” May
   said.
</P><P>“Historically, the common law provides a cause of action to get into court.” </P><H5>‘It’s Not Going Away’</H5><P>But defense counsel are critical of the public nuisance suits, which they say unfairly
   target companies for engaging in legal activity. 
</P><P>“To make a handful of companies responsible for billions in damages for <mark>climate change</mark>
   is inherently lawless and unprincipled,” Ruskin said. 
</P><P>Ruskin defends industrial companies and manufacturers in products liability, toxic
   tort, and environmental actions.
</P><P>The suits, he said, “respond to a failure of government to address <mark>climate change</mark>.”
   
</P><P>“But as extreme as Trump is to the right, it’s an equally disturbing result on the
   other end of the spectrum,” he said. “There’s a big social problem, and a lack of
   funds to address it so we turn to people whose product was perfectly legal.”
</P><P>Ruskin, too, predicts more such suits in other states. </P><P>“Of course there will be copycat cases. If a city attorney or AG is running for election,
   these are popular cases,” he said. 
</P><P>“The plaintiffs’ bar will keep hammering,” he said. “It’s not going to go away.” </P><P>Ruskin said, however, the plaintiffs’ assertions that they can quantify the <mark>carbon</mark>
   dioxide and methane emissions attributable to each defendant “is a lot of smoke and
   mirrors.”
</P><P>“It’s like claiming if you have a million dairy cows, each of which emits methane,
   you can somehow determine how much any one cow’s methane releases contribute to <mark>climate</mark>
   change,” he said. “It just cannot be done. It’s junk science.”
</P><P>Ruskin also said he expects courts to look at the claims skeptically because both
   the U.S. Supreme Court, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, found
   federal common law nuisance claims barred under the Clean Air Act in 
   <I><A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Am_Electric_Power_Co_v_Connecticut_564_US_410_131_S_Ct_2527_180_L?doc_id=X1FJHB2003?jcsearch=+131+supreme+court+2527"">Am. Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut</A></I>, 564 U.S. 410 (2011) and 
   <I><A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Native_Vill_of_Kivalina_v_ExxonMobil_Corp_696_F3d_849_75_ERC_1289?doc_id=X1Q6MDH3D2O2?jcsearch=+696+f+3d+849"">Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp</A>. 696 F.3d 849, (9th Cir. 2012)
   </I>. 
</P><P>But, he acknowledged, “who knows how a state court in California is going to look
   at this?”
</P><H5>Distinguishing the Federal Rulings</H5><P>Professor May certainly sees some advantages for plaintiffs in having the first set
   of suits proceeding in the Golden State. 
</P><P>“The common law is a little more generous” in California than in other states, he
   said, including a more lenient statute of limitations and a higher bar to preemption.
   
</P><P>A California appeals court recently 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/uec"">upheld</A>, but trimmed, a high-profile lead paint public nuisance ruling against Sherwin-Williams,
   NL Industries and ConAgra Grocery Products. 
</P><P>The court affirmed liability findings in the case, but sent the suit back to a trial
   court to recalculate the $1.15 billion judgment against the companies.
</P><P>May also said that if the <mark>climate change</mark> nuisance cases end up being moved to federal
   court, the Ninth Circuit, despite the 
   <I>Kivalina</I> ruling, is overall a good circuit for a plaintiff to be in.
</P><P>And there’s the simple fact that California is a major greenhouse gas producer, he
   said. 
</P><P>Professor Burger, at Columbia Law School, said both 
   <I>AEP</I> and 
   <I>Kivalina</I> are distinguishable from the California cases. 
</P><P>“The analysis for whether federal legislation displaces a federal common law claim
   is different than the analysis for whether federal legislation preempts state law,”
   he said. 
</P><P>“State nuisance claims for air <mark>pollution</mark> have been found to not be preempted in several
   important cases,” Burger said. “And there is nothing in the Clean Air Act to indicate
   that Congress expressly or implicitly intended to preempt state common law claims
   based on harms from <mark>climate change</mark>.”
</P><P>But other federal appeals courts have found the opposite, including in

</P><H5>New Science </H5><P><A class=""bluenobold"" href=""https://www.sheredling.com/team/vic-sher/"">Vic Sher</A>, attorney for the Marin, Imperial Beach and San Mateo plaintiffs, cites scientific
   advances, and new media reporting showing industry culpability, as other factors supporting
   the new set of <mark>climate change</mark> suits.
</P><P>“In terms of science, there have been developments showing links between emissions
   and impacts and the attribution of them to particular corporate actions,” Sher said.
   “And investigative reporting shows what they did and didn’t do.” 
</P><P>Muffett, of the Center for International Environmental Law, said it is now possible
   to “to quantify contributions of individual corporate actors to <mark>carbon</mark> in the atmosphere.”
   
</P><P>“Two-thirds of all industrial emissions of C02 and methane since the industrial revolution
   can be traced to 90 entities,” Muffett said, citing a 2013 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/uWZ"">study</A> by Richard Heede, co-founder of the <mark>Climate</mark> Accountability Institute in Snowmass,
   Colo. 
</P><P>“Courts aren’t comfortable dealing with a million defendants. But they are comfortable
   dealing with 50,” he said. “Once we get to a constrained universe of defendants, the
   landscape changes completely.” 
</P><P>But Burger of Columbia Law School said it remains to be seen whether the alleged link
   between <mark>climate change</mark> and energy emissions will be sufficient to establish liability
   under state nuisance law.
</P><P>“There is no single, established methodology for attributing greenhouse gas emissions
   to fossil fuel companies based on the eventual combustion of the products they put
   into the market,” Burger said. 
</P><P>“Plaintiffs in the California cases have offered one method. Defendants will undoubtedly
   challenge it in numerous ways—from the technical details to the central assumptions,”
   he said. 
</P><P>“But courts are well equipped to figure out how responsibility should be apportioned
   among different actors with different types and degrees of responsibility,” Burger
   said.
</P><H5><B>Other Claims </B></H5><P>As the public nuisance cases make their way through the courts, they are not the only
   suits pending against energy companies and other defendants over <mark>climate change</mark>. 
</P><P>The Ninth Circuit heard oral arguments Dec. 11 in a 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/uIA"">suit</A> brought by children who allege the federal government has violated their constitutional
   right to a livable <mark>climate</mark> by failing to reduce greenhouse gases.
</P><P>And, in November, a German court ruled that a Peruvian farmer may proceed with his
   claims that German energy utility RWE’s emissions have caused glacier melt in his
   home town. 
</P><P>The RWE case is an “important development,” Burger said. “It’s similar to the public
   nuisance cases, and further along than any of these cases have gotten in the US,”
   he said.

The oil and gas company made the internal papers public and <A href=""http://www.exxonmobilperspectives.com/2015/10/21/when-it-comes-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change-read-the-documents/"">challenged anyone</A> to “read all of these documents and make up your own mind,” accusing journalists of cherry-picking data.<P>Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes, from Harvard's Department of the History of Science, took up that challenge, comparing the information in the documents cited by ExxonMobil against the information conveyed in the publicly-available advertorial columns published by the company on anthropogenic (or human-caused) <mark>climate change</mark> in the <EM>New York Times</EM>. They found that “83 percent of peer-reviewed papers and 80 percent of internal documents acknowledge that <mark>climate change</mark> is real and human-caused, yet only 12 percent of advertorials do so, with 81 percent instead expressing doubt.”</P><P>The research comes at a tricky time for ExxonMobil, when Attorneys General from 17 states as well as the officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission have <A href=""https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/11/exxon-mobile-probed-for-misleading-investors-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change-risks/"">launched investigations of the company</A> due to allegations that ExxonMobil misled the public and investors on the risks of anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>. Recently, <A href=""https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/exxon-investors-clash-with-executives-vote-in-favor-of-annual-<mark>climate</mark>-report/"">investors voted that the company</A> should produce an annual report on the risks that <mark>climate change</mark> policies might pose to ExxonMobil’s global businesses, despite opposition from the company’s executives.</P><H2>&quot;Stranded fossil fuel assets&quot;</H2><P>The Harvard analysis, published this week in the journal <EM>Environmental Research Letters</EM>, focused on communication and research produced by ExxonMobil between 1977-2014. The researchers compared the internal and research reports to a couple dozen advertorials placed by ExxonMobil in the <EM>New York Times</EM> during those years. Advertorials (meaning, paid-content columns written in the style of opinion pieces) were chosen to represent ExxonMobil's communication with the public because the columns “come directly from ExxonMobil and are an unequivocally public form of communication” designed to affect public opinion.</P><P>The researchers then used a detailed &quot;point&quot; system to assess the advertorials. With their numbered ratings, they were able to sort them based on whether they expressed reasonable or unreasonable doubt of <mark>climate change</mark>. “We recognize that all science involves uncertainties, and therefore that doubt is not, <EM>ipso facto</EM>, an inappropriate response to complex scientific information,” the researchers wrote. Advertorials expressing doubt of <mark>climate change</mark> that were published on or before 1990 were considered to express a reasonable doubt. On or before 1995, the researchers considered doubt over <EM>human-caused</EM> <mark>climate change</mark> to be reasonable. (The researchers stress that these are conservative thresholds.)</P><P>Similar analysis is applied to internal knowledge vs. external communication on the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>, and the possibility of <mark>climate change</mark> and policy leading to “stranded fossil fuel assets,” which would affect investors.</P><P>The paper states that ExxonMobil does not appear to have “suppressed” <mark>climate</mark> science. Instead, ”in public, ExxonMobil contributed quietly to the science and loudly to raising doubts about it.“</P><P>“On the question of whether ExxonMobil misled non-scientific audiences about <mark>climate</mark> science, our analysis supports the conclusion that it did,” the researchers write. “Internal documents show that by the early 1980s, ExxonMobil scientists and managers were sufficiently informed about <mark>climate</mark> science and its prevailing uncertainties to identify AGW [Anthropogenic Global Warming] as a potential threat to its business interests.”</P><P>The researchers also note that to find all of ExxonMobil’s scientific <mark>climate</mark> studies, they required access to Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology libraries, as well as international interlibrary loans—a level of research support that a layperson would not generally have.</P><P>Ars contacted Exxon, but the company did not respond to a request for comment. <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-<mark>climate</mark>change-exxon-idUSKCN1B31TR"">To Reuters</A>, Exxon spokesperson Scott Silvestri &quot;said the researchers' study was ‘inaccurate and preposterous’ and that their goal was to attack the company's reputation at the expense of its shareholders.”</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><SECTION class=""inline-video"" title=""The Greatest Leap, Episode 3: Triumph"" data-video-overlay-template-id=""tmpl-5a340160148bb05431000005""><H3>Latest Ars Video <SPAN>&gt;</SPAN></H3><DIV class=""video-description""><H2>The Greatest Leap, Episode 3: Triumph</H2><SPAN>In honor of the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Apollo Program, Ars Technica brings you an in depth look at the Apollo missions through the eyes of the participants.</SPAN></DIV><TEMPLATE type=""text/template"" id=""tmpl-5a340160148bb05431000005""><FIGURE class=""video""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption""><DIV class=""caption-text"">The Greatest Leap, Episode 3: Triumph</DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H3>The Greatest Leap, Episode 3: Triumph</H3><P class=""excerpt"">In honor of the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Apollo Program, Ars Technica brings you an in depth look at the Apollo missions through the eyes of the participants.</P></TEMPLATE></SECTION></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""column-wrapper""><DIV class=""left-column""><SECTION class=""article-author""><DIV class=""author-bio""><SECTION class=""author-bio-top""><A href=""/author/megan-geuss"" class=""author-name"">Megan Geuss</A>

Since then the county of Santa Cruz and the cities of San Francisco, Oakland and Santa Cruz have joined the suit as plaintiffs.</P><P>In January, ExxonMobil struck back, petitioning the Tarrant County District Court in Texas to allow it to question 17 government officials who work for the plaintiffs and a Hagens Berman lawyer. The move has been interpreted as the first step toward ExxonMobil suing the government entities. ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.</P><P>Among the officials that ExxonMobil wants to depose are County Administrator Matthew Hymel and Marin County Counsel Brian Washington.</P><P>“It’s not technically a lawsuit yet,” Washington said, “but they’ve filed in court to ask for permission to do investigative depositions to try to find evidence for a lawsuit.”</P><P>Washington said the city and counties involved in the litigation are fighting ExxonMobil’s right to take those depositions.</P><P>“We don’t think the Texas court has jurisdiction over this issue,” Washington said. “That is being litigated in Texas right now.”</P><H5>Asserts bad faith</H5><P>ExxonMobil is asserting the suit against the oil companies demonstrates bad faith because while the government entities are asserting global warming will result in costly damages to their jurisdictions they have not disclosed this fact in their bond offerings.</P><P>For example, ExxonMobil says that in the suit Marin County asserts a 99 percent risk it will experience a devastating flood before 2050 but has not disclosed this to investors in bond offerings.</P><P>Last week, Marin and the other four plaintiffs counterpunched with the help of Martha Mahan Haines, who headed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of Municipal Securities from 2001 to 2011. Prior to that, Haines worked for more than 20 years as a municipal bond attorney in private practice.</P><DIV id=""div_Cube_Article""><SPAN id=""AD_text"">Advertisement</SPAN></DIV><P>In a detailed report, Haines wrote, “None of the municipal governments either made an untrue statement of a material fact regarding sea level change, or where relevant, <mark>climate change</mark> in their respective documents for the securities offerings identified in (ExxonMobil’s) petition or omitted such a material fact necessary in order to make the information included therein, not misleading.”</P><P>In addition, Haines wrote, “There is no inconsistency or conflict between the allegations in the complaints filed by the municipal governments in connection with their respective civil tort claims against Exxon and other fossil fuel companies regarding sea level rise and the disclosures made by such governments in their respective disclosure documents.”</P><H5>‘Legal stunt’</H5><P>Since January, ExxonMobil’s line of argument has been taken up by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who sent letters to the SEC asking for an investigation into these allegations. NAM’s president, Jay Timmons, repeated the claims on a radio talk show in Boston, and the charges are being blogged and tweeted via the internet.</P><P>Supervisor Damon Connolly said, “Exxon’s accusations are nothing more than a PR and legal stunt designed to distract attention from their role in causing the <mark>climate change</mark>-related damages facing Marin and other communities.</P><P>“The Haines Report unequivocally refutes Exxon’s claims, as well as those from the National Association of Manufacturers and other fossil fuel industry surrogates, so we are not concerned about liability,” Connolly said. “Thus far, we’ve only expended staff time on this issue. It’s important that we stand up to their efforts to intimidate us, and the Haines report only helps our cause.”</P><P>At the end of March, U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in New York City dismissed with prejudice an ExxonMobil lawsuit seeking to stop the states of New York and Massachusetts from investigating whether the oil and gas company had knowledge about <mark>climate change</mark> and lied to investors and the public concerning that knowledge.</P><P>ExxonMobil sued in June 2016 after receiving subpoenas from the state attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts requesting documents about the company’s historical understanding of global warming and communications with shareholders and other interest groups. ExxonMobil accused the attorney generals, both Democrats, of conspiring to “silence and intimidate one side of the public policy debate,” thus violating its rights to free speech and due process.</P><H5>Huffman reacts</H5><P>On Jan. 9, New York City announced it is separately suing the world’s five largest oil companies — ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Conoco-Phillips and Royal Dutch Shell — seeking unspecified financial compensation for present and future damage to the city caused by <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“You have to expect these Rambo litigator tactics; the oil companies are not going to go gently,” said Rep. Jared Huffman, D-San Rafael. “The liability that this litigation could present for them is historic and transformative.”</P><P>Huffman expects the oil companies to borrow from the tobacco companies’ playbook.</P><P>“When they were being held accountable for profiteering at the expense of the public health, they went after the character, habits and actions of the smokers who died because of their product,” Huffman said. “You’re going to see Exxon and the other fossil fuel companies do the exact same thing in this case.”</P><P>Huffman predicts in the end, however, the oil companies will be no more successful than the tobacco companies.</P><P>“They will be held accountable,” he said, “and that liability has the potential to really transform this <mark>climate change</mark> issue like almost nothing else.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""author-info"" id=""author""><H4>About the Author</H4></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

The company claims the lawyers, public officials and environmental activists are “conspiring” against it in a coordinated legal and public relations campaign.</P><P>Exxon has even given that campaign a vaguely sinister-sounding name: “The La Jolla playbook.” According to the company, about two dozen people hatched a strategy against it at a meeting six years ago in an oceanfront cottage in La Jolla, Calif.</P><P>&quot;It’s an aggressive move,” said Howard Erichson, an expert in complex litigation and a professor at Fordham University School of Law in New York. “Does Exxon really need these depositions or is Exxon seeking the depositions to harass mayors and city attorneys into dropping their lawsuits?”</P><H3>At Stake</H3><P>Experts say Exxon’s combative strategy -- an extraordinary gambit to turn the tables -- is a clear sign of what’s at stake for the fossil-fuel industry. So far, New York City and eight California cities and counties, including San Francisco and Oakland, have sued Exxon and other oil and gas companies. They allege that oil companies denied findings of <mark>climate</mark>-change scientists despite knowing that the use of fossil fuels posed “grave risk” to the planet.</P><P>Attorneys general Eric Schneiderman of New York and Maura Healey of Massachusetts, are investigating whether Exxon covered up information on <mark>climate change</mark>, defrauding shareholders and consumers.</P><P>Exxon, the world’s 10th biggest company, has denied the allegations and says its defense is intended to show that it’s being punished for not toeing the line on <mark>climate change</mark>, even though it agrees with the scientific consensus.</P><P>“The attorneys general have violated Exxon Mobil’s right to participate in the national conversation about how to address the risks presented by <mark>climate change</mark>,” said Dan Toal, a lawyer who represents Exxon. “That is the speech at issue here -- not some straw man argument about whether <mark>climate change</mark> is real.”</P><H3>‘Scare Tactic’</H3><P>Plaintiff lawyers and legal experts contend the oil giant’s tactics are meant to intimidate while shifting the spotlight away from claims of environmental damage. And they say there’s nothing improper with lawyers discussing legal strategies together.</P><P>&quot;It’s crazy that people are subpoenaed for attending a meeting,&quot; said Sharon Eubanks, a lawyer who was at the La Jolla gathering. &quot;It’s sort of like a big scare tactic: reframe the debate, use it as a diversionary tactic and scare the heck out of everybody.&quot;</P><P>Exxon has focused on the La Jolla meeting as ground zero for its conspiracy claim. Ironically, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a nonprofit run by descendants of John D. Rockefeller who are pressing Exxon to address <mark>climate change</mark> issues, has funded organizations that led the La Jolla conference (Exxon, which grew out of John D.’s Standard Oil, also subpoenaed the fund to testify.)</P><P>At the gathering, participants met to discuss litigation strategies that could be applied to <mark>climate change</mark>, according to a 35-page summary that was later made public. Eubanks, a former Justice Department lawyer, talked about how the U.S. government used the racketeering law against cigarette makers, for example.</P><P>More than four years after the meeting, Eubanks got a subpoena from Exxon to testify about it. The subpoena is pending.</P><H3>Document Request</H3><P>Exxon has also aimed its legal firepower at Matthew Pawa, whose firm represents Oakland, San Francisco and New York in their suits against Exxon. Last month, Exxon asked a state judge in Fort Worth, Texas, to order Pawa to turn over documents and testify under oath about the La Jolla conference and other conversations with lawyers and activists. He’s also been subpoenaed to testify in a federal action Exxon has brought against the state attorneys general.</P><P>Pawa declined to comment.</P><P>The company is also seeking testimony from 15 municipal lawyers and officials in California. Exxon said it’s seeking evidence for “an anticipated suit” claiming civil conspiracy and violation of its First Amendment and other Constitutional rights.</P><H3>Routine Meetings</H3><P>Experts in litigation say that lawyers in big lawsuits, including those targeting tobacco, guns and pharmaceuticals, routinely meet to share information and coordinate strategy.</P><P>“I don’t think there’s anything wrong with plaintiffs’ lawyers and attorneys general strategizing together,” said Fordham professor Erichson, ”just as I don’t think there’s anything wrong with lawyers for oil companies strategizing together.”</P><P>But Linda Kelly, general counsel of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the <mark>climate</mark> litigation is really a play for money and votes.</P><P>“It’s a coming together of plaintiffs’ lawyers who have a profit motive and a liability theory, environmental activists who have a political agenda and politicians who are looking to make a name for themselves with this issue,” Kelly said.</P><H3>Contingent Fees</H3><P>San Francisco has promised 23.5 percent of any settlement to its lawyers. New York is working on a contingent-fee deal like San Francisco’s, according to a spokesman for the city’s Law Department.</P><P>In recent years, the most notable attack on a plaintiff lawyer came in 2011 when Chevron Corp., claiming it was target of an extortion scheme, successfully pursued a civil racketeering suit against Steven Donziger, the attorney behind a $9.5 billion Ecuadorian judgment against the company over <mark>pollution</mark> in the Amazon.</P><P>Some experts say Exxon’s strategy goes beyond mere litigation tactics.</P><P>&quot;People often try to use litigation to change the cultural conversation,&quot; said Alexandra Lahav, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law, pointing to litigation over guns and gay rights as examples. &quot;Exxon is positioning itself as a victim rather than a perpetrator.&quot;</P></DIV><DIV class=""social-buttons"" data-theme=""businessweek""><DIV class=""share-article-button""><DIV class=""share-article-button__label"">Share</DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

ExxonMobil Corp.</A></EM>, 696 F.3d 849 (9th Cir. 2012), dealt another blow to recent attempts to use the federal common law tort system to address issues relating to greenhouse gas emissions and <mark>climate change</mark>. The Supreme Court held last year, in<EM><A href=""http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-174.pdf"">American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut</A></EM>, 131 S. Ct. 2527 (2011) (<EM>AEP)</EM>, that federal common law claims seeking emissions caps against “major” sources of greenhouse gases are displaced by the Clean Air Act (CAA). The Court held that federal common law could not proceed because the CAA sets forth a method to address these issues, through U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) action, and thereby left no room for a parallel track of regulation through common law litigation. The Ninth Circuit held in <EM>Kivalina </EM>that the same reasoning also precludes federal common law claims seeking monetary damages, rather than injunctive relief. Together, these cases might spell the end of <mark>climate change</mark> tort litigation in the federal courts.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""premiumarticle""><DIV class=""premiumpar parsys""><DIV class=""text parbase section""><DIV class=""text""><H1>The litigation and appeal process</H1><P>The complaint in <EM>Kivalina </EM>was filed in February 2008, by the governing bodies of an Alaskan tribal village. They alleged that their village is being threatened by the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>—specifically, by the reduction in protective sea ice and an increase in storms and flooding—and asserted that the 24 oil, energy, and utility companies named as defendants should be held liable for the costs of relocating the village, estimated at $400 million, because they had allegedly contributed to the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> through their greenhouse gas emissions. The plaintiffs styled their cause of action as a “nuisance” claim under federal common law, although they asserted in the alterative that their claims might also proceed as a matter of state common law.</P><P>The defendants raised three principal objections. First, they argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the claims because they could not show that <mark>climate change</mark> or its effects were “fairly traceable” to these individual defendants, as required under Article III of the Constitution. Second, they asserted that the claims were not justiciable under the political question doctrine because, in order to determine a “reasonable” level of greenhouse gas emissions for a particular company or industry, a court would need to make decisions regarding national policy with respect to appropriate greenhouse gas levels that are reserved under the Constitution for the legislative and executive branches. Third, the defendants argued that the court lacked authority to recognize the asserted “nuisance” claims as a matter of federal common law—without express congressional authorization—and that such claims would in any event be displaced by the CAA.</P><P>The district court dismissed the federal common law claims in October 2009, holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing and, further, that the claims presented non-justiciable political questions. <EM><A href=""http://legalplanet.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/663_f-supp-2d_8631.pdf"">Native Vill. of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp</A>.</EM>, 663 F. Supp. 2d 863, 879–80 (N.D. Cal. 2009). The court found it unnecessary, in light of these holdings, to address whether the claims could properly be recognized under federal common law or, if so, whether they would be displaced by the CAA. <EM>Id.</EM> at 882–83. The court also did not address whether the claims might be brought under state common law, after declining to exercise jurisdiction over those claims following dismissal of the federal issues. <EM>Id.</EM></P><P>The plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit. After initial briefing was completed, but before argument was scheduled, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <EM>AEP</EM>, holding that federal common law claims seeking injunctive relief against sources of greenhouse gas emissions were displaced by the CAA. 131 S. Ct. at 2537–38. In supplemental briefs, the defendants argued that <EM>AEP</EM> compelled dismissal of the claims in <EM>Kivalina</EM>, while the plaintiffs asserted that <EM>AEP</EM> was distinguishable because the claims in that case sought injunctive, not monetary, relief. The appeal was argued in November 2011, before Ninth Circuit Judges Sidney Thomas and Richard Clifton and District Judge Phillip Pro of the District of Nevada, sitting by designation.</P><H1>Ninth Circuit decision</H1><P>On September 21, 2012, the panel unanimously affirmed the district court’s judgment. <EM>Kivalina</EM>, 696 F.3d at 858. It did not, however, rely upon or even address the two issues on which that judgment was based—standing and political question. Rather, the panel’s opinion focused exclusively on federal common law and displacement. <EM>Id. </EM></P><P>The panel found, first, that the “<mark>climate change</mark>” claims asserted by the plaintiffs were potentially “viable under federal common law in the first instance.” <EM>Id.</EM> at 855–56. It acknowledged the principle that federal courts generally cannot develop common law causes of action without express authorization from Congress, <EM>id.</EM> at 855 (citing <EM>Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins</EM>, 304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938)), but it said that courts may nevertheless do so when necessary to resolve “federal questions that are not answered by statutes,” <EM>id.</EM> In support, the panel cited the Supreme Court’s opinion in <EM>AEP</EM>, which—although it explicitly declined to resolve this particular question—noted at one point that “[w]hen we deal with air and water in the ambient or interstate aspects, there is a federal common law.” 131 S. Ct. at 2535 (quoting <EM>Illinois v. City of Milwaukee</EM>, 406 U.S. 91, 103 (1972)). For that reason, according to the panel, “federal common law can apply to transboundary <mark>pollution</mark> suits. . . . [which] often, as in this case, . . . are founded on a theory of public nuisance.” <EM>Kivalina</EM>, 696 F.3d at 855.</P><P>However, the panel then concluded that, even if the claims might have been viable at one time, they are now displaced by the CAA. <EM>Id.</EM> at 858. A federal common law claim is displaced by federal statute, the panel explained, when the statute “speaks directly to the question” addressed by the claim. <EM>Id.</EM> at 856 (quoting <EM>AEP</EM>, 131 S. Ct. at 2537). While this analysis may sometimes be “complex” and “fact-specific”—in order to determine “whether Congress has provided a sufficient legislative solution to the particular [issue] to warrant a conclusion that the legislation has occupied the field to the exclusion of federal common law,” <EM>id.</EM> (quoting <EM>Michigan v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs</EM>, 667 F.3d 765, 777 (7th Cir. 2011))—the panel said it was simple in this case, given the Supreme Court’s holding in <EM>AEP</EM> that the CAA displaced the <mark>climate change</mark> claims presented there. <EM>Id.</EM> That holding, the panel concluded, was directly applicable to the plaintiffs’ claims. <EM>Id.</EM> at 858.</P><P>The panel acknowledged but quickly rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that <EM>AEP</EM> was distinguishable because it addressed claims for injunctive relief, rather than monetary damages. <EM>Id.</EM> at 856–58. The panel noted that the Supreme Court had previously “rejected similar attempts to sever remedies from their causes of action,” <EM>id.</EM> at 857 (quoting <EM>Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker</EM>, 554 U.S. 471, 489 (2008)), and had found federal common law “nuisance” claims based on water <mark>pollution</mark> to be displaced by the Clean Water Act whether the relief sought was injunctive or monetary in nature, <EM>id.</EM> (citing <EM>City of Milwaukee v. Illinois</EM>, 451 U.S. 304, 314,25 (1981); <EM>Middlesex Cnty. Sewage Auth. v. Nat’l Sea Clammers Ass’n</EM>, 453 U.S. 1, 4 (1981)). Finding these decisions controlling, the panel held that the federal common law claims in <EM>Kivalina </EM>were displaced. <EM>Id.</EM> at 858.</P><P>Judge Pro issued a separate concurring opinion, to address two separate points. First, he suggested that there was “tension” in the Supreme Court’s displacement jurisprudence. <EM>Id.</EM> In particular, he posited that <EM>Exxon Shipping </EM>may represent a “departure” from other displacement cases, insofar as it seemed to suggest (in holding that the Clean Water Act did not displace common law claims for punitive damages linked to an oil spill) that “the right and the remedy may indeed be severed when the particular claim at issue seeks injunctive relief versus damages.” <EM>Id.</EM> at 862–63. Nevertheless, he found that <EM>AEP</EM> and prior “nuisance” decisions of the Supreme Court in the water <mark>pollution</mark> context were sufficiently clear to control the outcome and compel displacement in this case. <EM>Id.</EM> at 866. Second, Judge Pro opined that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their claims in federal court under Article III of the Constitution, because in his view the alleged link between defendants’ greenhouse gas emissions and the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> was too “attenuated” to support the necessary finding of causation. <EM>Id.</EM> at 867–69. He distinguished <EM>Massachusetts v. EPA</EM>, 549 U.S. 497 (2007), in which the Supreme Court upheld a state’s standing to challenge EPA’s refusal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, on grounds that <EM>Massachusetts</EM> had been brought by a state pursuant to an express statutory right of action. <EM>Kivalina</EM>, 696 F.3d at 869.</P><P>Neither the panel opinion nor Judge Pro’s concurrence addressed whether the plaintiffs’ claims might proceed as a matter of state law, as that question was not presented on appeal. Nevertheless, the implications of the panel’s opinion may suggest that such claims would be preempted by the CAA. Although the standard for preemption of state law is traditionally regarded as more demanding than that for displacement of federal common law, in either circumstance a federal statute that sets forth a “comprehensive” method for regulating in a particular area will generally be deemed to preclude all common law claims in the field, whether under federal or state common law. <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> Int’l Paper Co. v. Ouellette</EM>, 479 U.S. 481 (1987). Insofar as both <EM>AEP</EM> and <EM>Kivalina</EM> imply that the CAA is precisely this type of statute, as applied to issues relating to greenhouse gas emissions and <mark>climate change</mark>, <EM>see Kivalina</EM>, 696 F.3d at 866, they would seemingly also bar the plaintiffs’ claims as a matter of state law (as at least one district court has recently held, <EM>Comer v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc.</EM>, 839 F. Supp. 2d 849, 868 (S.D. Miss. 2012)). But the opinion does not actually resolve the preemption question, and for that reason, as Judge Pro noted in his concurrence, <EM>Kivalina</EM>, 696 F.3d at 866, it is possible that other plaintiffs may attempt to repackage such claims in state court.</P><H1>A new hurdle for <mark>climate change</mark> tort claimants</H1><P>The decision in <EM>Kivalina</EM>, given its heavy reliance on <EM>AEP</EM>, might be viewed as simply affirming existing law, as opposed to announcing any new legal principle. But the panel’s holding, even if pre-ordained, is nevertheless important: it confirms that the displacement analysis of <EM>AEP </EM>applies to all federal common law “<mark>climate change</mark>” claims, whatever the nature of the relief sought. That holding, assuming it does not categorically bar all such claims, at the least presents another large hurdle to future plaintiffs who would seek to address issues relating to greenhouse gases and <mark>climate change</mark> through federal common law litigation, rather than the legislative and regulatory process.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

(Michael Nagle/Bloomberg)</SPAN></DIV><P>ExxonMobil management was defeated Wednesday by a shareholder rebellion over <mark>climate change</mark>, as investors with 62.3 percent of shares voted to instruct the oil giant to report on the impact of global measures designed to keep <mark>climate change</mark> to 2 degrees centigrade.</P><P>The shareholder rebellion at the ExxonMobil annual meeting in Dallas was led by major financial advisory firms and fund managers who traditionally have played passive roles. Although the identity of voters wasn’t disclosed, a source familiar with the vote said that major financial advisory firm BlackRock had cast its shares in opposition to Exxon management and that Vanguard and State Street had likely done the same. All three financial giants have been openly considering casting their votes against management on this key proxy resolution.</P><P>The shareholder vote on <mark>climate change</mark> came on a day when President Trump appeared to be nearing a decision on whether to exit the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement, underlining the deep political and economic divisions over how to deal with the global challenge. Even as the Trump administration’s commitment to the <mark>climate</mark> accord wavered, the Exxon vote showed that <mark>climate</mark> concerns were gaining ground in the business world.</P><P><A href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/video/business/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-paris-agreement-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change/2016/09/30/b3d0a8c6-8747-11e6-b57d-dd49277af02f_video.html"">What you need to know about the Paris Agreement on <mark>climate change</mark></A></P><P>BlackRock and Vanguard are the biggest shareholders in ExxonMobil, owning 13 percent, or $43.6 billion worth, of the company’s stock. State Street Global Advisers, another big financial advisory firm that has called for greater <mark>climate</mark> disclosures, is close behind with 5.1 percent of the stock. The vote by them against management marked an important step for groups that have been trying to force corporations to adopt greater disclosure and transparency about the financial fallout of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>BlackRock, which said that <mark>climate</mark> disclosure is one of its top priorities, had warned on its website that “our patience is not infinite.”</P><P>“This is an unprecedented victory for investors in the fight to ensure a smooth transition to a low <mark>carbon</mark> economy,” said New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, a trustee of the New York Common Retirement Fund which co-sponsored the proxy resolution. “<mark>Climate change</mark> is one of the greatest long-term risks we face in our portfolio and has direct impact on the core business of ExxonMobil,” he said in a statement.</P><P channel=""wp.com"" class=""interstitial-link""><I> [<A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/01/26/besieged-by-<mark>climate</mark>-controversy-exxonmobil-puts-a-<mark>climate</mark>-scientist-on-its-board/"">Besieged by <mark>climate</mark> controversy, ExxonMobil puts a <mark>climate</mark> scientist on its board</A>] </I></P><P>The resolution, which was co-sponsored by the New York City pension fund, says that the company “should analyze the impacts on ExxonMobil’s oil and gas reserves and resources under a scenario in which reduction in demand results from <mark>carbon</mark> restrictions and related rules or commitments adopted by governments consistent with the globally agreed upon 2 degree [Celsius] target.”</P><P>The resolution adds that “this reporting should assess the resilience of the company’s full portfolio of reserves and resources through 2040 and beyond, and address the financial risks associated with such a scenario.”</P><P>It notes that other major oil companies including BP, Total, ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell have endorsed the two degree analysis.</P><P>BlackRock’s website injected a sense of urgency about the issue.</P><P>“As a long-term investor, we are willing to be patient with companies when our engagement affirms they are working to address our concerns,” it said.</P><P>However, it added, “when we do not see progress despite ongoing engagement, or companies are insufficiently responsive to our efforts to protect the long-term economic interests of our clients, we will not hesitate to exercise our right to vote against management recommendations.”</P><P>Fidelity Investments said it was adopting the U.N.’s Principles for Responsible Investment, though a spokesman said that was just a “formulization of what we’ve done for a long time.”</P><P>The prospect of major financial management firms joining pension funds such as California’s and New York’s that have backed social and environmental resolutions in the past is already putting some companies on the defensive.</P><P>This month similar resolutions demanding that management explain how <mark>climate change</mark> could affect their businesses were adopted at Occidental Petroleum and PPL, a large utility holding company. Occidental’s shareholders backed the resolution with a 67 percent majority, including BlackRock in its first vote ever against a company’s management over the <mark>climate</mark> issue. Similar resolutions fell just short  including at Dominion with 48 percent and Duke Energy and Southern Co with 46 percent each.</P><P>Major shareholders have also leveled criticism at ExxonMobil’s board of directors. Worried about the outcome of the Wednesday votes, the oil giant on Tuesday issued an addendum to its proxy statement, providing additional arguments and information to bolster its recommendation that shareholders reject resolutions about the responsiveness of the company’s board of directors.</P><P>While the management prevailed, the votes showed widespread discontent among Exxon shareholders. One resolution, requiring that a director running unopposed garner a majority of votes cast, was supported by 45.7 percent of the shares despite the opposition of management. A resolution backing an independent chairman separate from the chief executive garnered 38.2 percent. And a resolution that would enable 15 percent of shareholders the call a special meeting won 40 percent of the votes cast.</P><P>ExxonMobil rarely loses a shareholder resolution. Last year, ExxonMobil lost a vote over “proxy access,” which would enable large shareholders to nominate their own candidates for the board directly on the company’s ballot. The previous setback was in 2006, when a resolution relating to the election of directors received about 52 percent of the votes. After that, the company implemented a new policy about director resignations.</P><P>The ExxonMobil annual meeting was the first for Darren W. Woods as chief executive. He took over from Rex Tillerson, now secretary of state.</P><P>Although the company has written two open letters urging President Trump to stay in the Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord, ExxonMobil has remained the subject of criticism and litigation over whether it has adequately disclosed <mark>climate</mark> consequences of burning fossil fuels.</P><P>Some corporate governance groups have urged ExxonMobil to disclose more than the modest statement it currently files with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</P><P>But other experts say that the uncertainties about the size and consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> make disclosure useless.</P><P>At a recent Chamber of Commerce panel about whether the SEC should require greater disclosure, historian and oil industry expert and consultant Daniel Yergin said that events that take place in 30 years might not be material for Big Oil and gas companies and that it went “beyond the scope of what investors need to make decisions.” He said that there was a difference between scenarios and forecasts that provide foundations for financial planning. And financial regulation should not turn into <mark>climate</mark> regulation, he added.</P><P>“<mark>Climate</mark> regulation is best left to governments with expertise and not to financial regulators,” he said.</P><P>But Gretchen Goldman, research director at the center for science and democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that investors “are right that <mark>climate change</mark> can pose material risks to companies and that this is another indication that investors are demanding this information and are not satisfied with the way companies are acting.”</P><P>She said that <mark>climate change</mark> would persuade governments to restrict the use of fossil fuels and that much of the reserves held by oil, gas and coal companies could be “stranded” and never used.</P><P>In its proxy materials, ExxonMobil rejected that argument. It cited the International Energy Agency’s estimate that $11 trillion to $22 trillion would be needed through 2040 for energy investment in exploration and production.</P><P channel=""wp.com"" class=""interstitial-link""><I> [<A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/12/if-exxonmobil-were-a-country-it-would-be-the-worlds-41st-largest-economy/"">If ExxonMobil were a country, its economy would be bigger than Ireland’s</A>] </I></P><P>The company also said that it had done adequate disclosure in its annual “Outlook for Energy” document, which most recently said that global demand for energy would increase 25 percent through 2040 and that “oil will remain the world’s primary fuel.”</P><P>“We believe the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> are serious and warrant action, thoughtful action,” Woods said, repeating the proxy points. He said that the company uses a <mark>carbon</mark> cost to measure repeated potential impacts. But he defended the company’s mission, saying that “there’s a moral imperative to bring energy to people who live in energy poverty.”</P><P>Exxon’s feud over access to directors has added to friction with major shareholders. Edward Kamonjoh, of the 50/50 <mark>Climate</mark> Project, said that ExxonMobil barred shareholders from “engaging in a direct and unfiltered way” with directors. He called the board “ossified” thanks to the way it chooses new directors and the financial incentives for directors to serve until the age of 72.</P><P>Unhappy about those issues, BlackRock voted against two of ExxonMobil’s directors last year.</P><P>This year 50/50 <mark>Climate</mark> Project is urging shareholders to oppose director Kenneth Frazier, who chairs ExxonMobil’s Board Affairs Committee that has direct oversight responsibility for the investor engagement policy, board succession planning and director compensation.</P><P>Kamonjoh said that Exxon’s addendum to the proxy statement “feels a little desperate to me and is, in many respects, unprecedented but Exxon has been known to employ its well-oiled machinery to defeat proposals that are headed for majority investor support in the past.”</P><P>Major shareholders had planned a similar <mark>climate</mark> resolution for Chevron, which also held its annual meeting on Wednesday. But the company made additional disclosures and proponents of the measure withdrew it and said they would pursue further dialogue with Chevron management to address remaining issues.</P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""moat-trackable pb-f-theme-normal pb-f-dehydrate-false pb-f-async-false full pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-article-article-author-bio"" moat-id=""article/article-author-bio|business"" data-chain-name=""no-name"" data-feature-name=""no-name"" data-feature-id=""article/article-author-bio"" data-pb-fingerprint=""0f7Y1cjOKqD"" id=""fUpLQ61uzH1kSq""><DIV class=""pb-bottom-author-wrapper border-bottom-hairline border-bottom-100-pct""><DIV class=""pb-bottom-author""><DIV class=""pb-author-info col-sm-offset-2""><DIV class=""pb-author-bio"">Steven Mufson covers energy and other financial matters.

As stated in the filing:</P><BLOCKQUOTE itemprop=""citation"" class=""p p1""><P>Consistent with ExxonMobil's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Company's Board of Directors has reconsidered the proposal requesting a report on impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> policies (Item 12) that the New York State Common Retirement Fund submitted for the 2017 Annual Shareholders Meeting. In reconsidering the proposal, the Company sought input from a number of parties, such as the proponents and major shareholders. As such, the Board has decided to further enhance the Company's disclosures consistent with the Item 12 proposal and will seek to issue these disclosures in the near future. These enhancements will include energy demand sensitivities, implications of two degree Celsius scenarios, and positioning for a lower-<mark>carbon</mark> future.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p p1"">Last May, the company's <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/business/energy-environment/exxon-shareholders-<mark>climate</mark>-change.html"" rel=""nofollow"">shareholders voted</A> by a 62% margin in favor of a resolution that called for the company to conduct analyses into the risks posed to its business by <mark>climate change</mark>, especially within the context of the now-ratified Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Accord. The resolution, which had been unsuccessful in previous votes, was opposed by Exxon Mobil's directors, making last week's announcement a notable change of course by the company.</P><P class=""p p1"">The most important aspect of the company's pledge is its decision to analyse &quot;energy demand sensitivities&quot;, which will be driven by the Paris Agreement's 2 degrees C target and global energy de<mark>carbon</mark>ization efforts. For several years, many <mark>climate</mark> scientists have advocated for the planet's major emitters to work within the framework of a global &quot;<mark>carbon</mark> budget.&quot; Put simply, this budget compares the potential <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions contained in proved reserves of fossil fuels against the volume of emissions that can occur by 2100 without pushing the global atmospheric <mark>CO2</mark> concentration above 450 ppm (the threshold most commonly associated by scientists with a 2 degrees C temperature increase). While a certain amount of uncertainty regarding the size of even proved reserves exists, the potential emissions contained in the reserves substantially exceed the &quot;450 ppm budget&quot; under even conservative estimates.</P><P class=""p p2"">While the Paris Accord is not binding, it is intended to prepare the way for future binding multinational agreements on greenhouse gas emission reductions. Assuming that the world's major economies do succeed in maintaining the 450 ppm threshold via reduced emissions - and this, of course, is a very important assumption - then global fossil fuel demand will peak as the excess reserves end up being unextracted and uncombusted. Organizations such as the International Energy Agency and OECD have attempted to quantify the value of this excess that would become &quot;stranded&quot; and <A href=""https://www.oecd.org/sd-roundtable/papersandpublications/Divestment%20and%20Stranded%20Assets%20in%20the%20Low-<mark>carbon</mark>%20Economy%2032nd%20OECD%20RTSD.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">calculated it</A> to be up to $304 billion by 2035. Estimates by environmental groups have reached <A href=""https://qz.com/139907/<mark>climate</mark>-change-could-put-6-trillion-in-fossil-fuel-reserves-at-risk/"" rel=""nofollow"">as high as $6 trillion</A>, with academics <A href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v517/n7533/abs/nature14016.html#affil-auth"" rel=""nofollow"">calculating that</A> 33% of global petroleum and 50% of global natural gas reserves (as well as the large majority of global coal reserves) will need to become stranded by 2050 if the planet is to have even a 50% probability of remaining under the 2 degrees C threshold. (For a broader review of the various estimates, see my <A href=""https://seekingalpha.com/article/4012838-investors-guide-keep-ground-movement"">previous article</A> on the subject.)</P><P class=""p p2"">There are a number of very large uncertainties associated with the calculation of stranded assets, not least being the large geographical distributions of proved reserves, with the New York, Moscow, and London stock exchanges having the largest reserves in terms of <mark>carbon</mark> content (and London having the largest in terms of just coal). Predictions as to how stranded assets would be allocated to individual companies break down still further when considering the distinction between publicly-owned and state-owned owners of fossil reserves, with the latter <A href=""http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2017/03/cust.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">vastly exceeding</A> the former in terms of the total <mark>carbon</mark> contained in their reserves. This is only one of the analytical challenges that Exxon Mobil will now need to grapple with: the deployment rates of battery-electric vehicles (causing peak demand to be sooner) and <mark>carbon</mark> capture and sequestration technologies (causing policy-induced peak demand to be later) will also have major impacts on any attempt to quantify energy demand scenarios and sensitivities.</P><P class=""p p3"">These hurdles notwithstanding, Exxon Mobil's decision is not likely to hurt its investors, and not just because it has already prompted New York's comptroller <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxonmobil-<mark>climate</mark>/exxon-deal-aside-tough-proxy-season-looms-at-u-s-energy-firms-idUSKBN1E623E"" rel=""nofollow"">to withdraw</A> a similar resolution that his office had sponsored for the 2018 shareholder meeting. The company has also experienced two minor legal setbacks in recent weeks with regard to the continued investigation by the attorney generals of New York, Massachusetts, and other states into its past <mark>climate change</mark> research and energy policy modeling. Late last month, the federal judge who is hearing Exxon Mobil's attempt to counter the states' investigation <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-30/exxon-s-claim-of-bogus-probe-by-schneiderman-questioned-by-judge"" rel=""nofollow"">appeared dismissive</A> of the company's main argument against the investigation. The following week, some of the six Massachusetts justices hearing a similar appeal by the company in response to that state's role in the broader investigation also <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-mobil-<mark>climate</mark>change/exxon-takes-<mark>climate</mark>-change-probe-fight-to-massachusetts-top-court-idUSKBN1DZ1DQ"" rel=""nofollow"">sounded skeptical, in this case</A> about the company's argument that Massachusetts does not have jurisdiction over it.</P><P class=""p p3"">It is important to note that, even if the two courts rule against Exxon Mobil's immediate legal arguments, such a result would have little impact on the merits of the state AGs' broader investigation. Furthermore, it is not surprising that the company has decided to work with its shareholders despite (or perhaps because of) these setbacks given the common topics involved. Investors should not expect the company's future reports on energy demand sensitivities and policy impacts to be groundbreaking, however. As an energy policy wonk, I am personally quite interested to see how the company approaches the methodological quandaries that it now must handle. As mentioned above, however, the numerous uncertainties and sensitivities involved in any analysis of future energy demand and fossil asset stranding have resulted in a vast range of estimates being made by various research outfits. Given this reality, then, I must question just how useful the new reports will be to shareholders, given that the company already provides guidance to investors on its energy demand and policy expectations.</P><P class=""p p4"">Exxon Mobil's share price is still on track to achieve a small gain in Q4 (see figure), reflecting mixed behavior by petroleum and natural gas prices over the period. While the recent news regarding the company's legal developments and new reporting commitments is unlikely to have much of a short-term impact, it, along with Exxon Mobil's <A href=""https://seekingalpha.com/article/4126346-exxon-mobils-renewable-energy-moonshots"">recent activity</A> in the renewable energy sector, does symbolize a shifting landscape for the world's largest energy producers.</P><P class=""p p4""><FIGURE class=""sa-widget sa-ycharts"" data-id=""null"" data-name=""null""><A href=""http://ycharts.com/companies/XOM"" rel=""nofollow"">XOM</A> data by <A href=""http://ycharts.com"" rel=""nofollow"">YCharts</A></FIGURE></P><P id=""a-disclosure"" class=""p p4""><B>Disclosure:</B><SPAN>I am/we are long XLE.</SPAN></P><P class=""p p4"">I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

</FIGURE><P><mark>Exxon Mobil Corp.</mark> filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Friday, challenging <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/389/28610/file0.774302649117214.pdf"">the dismissal</A> last month of its suit against the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts over allegations their action over whether the energy giant committed fraud by withholding its research on <mark>climate change</mark> was solely motivated by politics.</P><P>U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni dismissed the suit on March 29, stating from the outset that Exxon was “[r]unning roughshod over the adage that the best defense is a good offense” in its suit against the attorneys general.</P><P>As Caproni noted, the suit’s basis was that the investigations amounted to retaliation against Exxon over the company’s views on <mark>climate change</mark>, and, therefore, violations of the company’s constitutional rights.</P><P>The suit was originally brought in Texas and then transferred to New York in March 2017. Exxon’s suit was an attempt to “stop state officials from conducting duly-authorized investigations into potential fraud,” Caproni said.</P><P>“It has done so on the basis of extremely thin allegations and speculative inferences,” Caproni continued, adding later in her opinion, “Exxon’s allegations that the AGs are pursuing bad faith investigations in order to violate Exxon’s constitutional rights are implausible and therefore must be dismissed for failure to state a claim.”</P><P>Beginning in 2015, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s office opened up an investigation into Exxon’s public statements about <mark>climate change</mark>. Brought under the state’s powerful Martin Act blue sky law, the investigation is probing whether the energy company lied about its own findings publicly and to investors, committing consumer and securities fraud. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced her own investigation under that state’s blue sky laws in April 2016.</P><P>While the respective suits have played out <A href=""https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/sites/newyorklawjournal/2017/06/19/schneidermans-latest-exxonmobil-subpoena-faces-resistance-from-the-bench/"">in state courts</A>, Exxon attempted to have a federal judge put an end to the investigations. Initially assigned to U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade of the Northern District of Texas, Exxon’s suit claimed the attorneys general were conducting “improper and politically motivated investigations … in a coordinated effort to silence and intimidate one side of the public policy debate on how to address <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>Kinkeade, who had allowed the suit to substantially proceed, transferred the case on his own motion in large part because much of the alleged activity—namely a March 2016 press conference and a subsequent closed-door meeting between the attorneys general and <mark>climate</mark> activists that Exxon claims revealed the attorneys general’s true motivations—took place in the Southern District of New York.</P><P>Caproni proved far less accepting of Exxon’s claims that it was targeted in an effort to improve the political standing of Schneiderman and Healey.</P><P>In a statement, Schneiderman spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick said the Attorney General’s Office expects the appeal to be dismissed.</P><P>“Last month, a federal judge made clear that Exxon’s lawsuit was nothing more than ‘legal jiu jitsu’ that resulted in a ‘huge waste’ of time and money,” she said.</P><P>Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison partners Theodore Wells Jr. and Daniel Toal are leading the appeal on Exxon’s behalf.
