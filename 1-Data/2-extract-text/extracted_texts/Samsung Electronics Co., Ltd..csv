                    Lubbock Day 2014: Tuesday, 13th May
                </H1><DIV id=""parent-fieldname-description"" class=""documentDescription""> Dr Kinam Kim, President of the Semiconductor Memory Business, the flagship component business of Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.(SEC), delivered the 40th Maurice Lubbock Memorial Lecture on 13th May, which was titled: “Technology <mark>innovation</mark>s revolutionising society”. For the first time the Department of Engineering Science held the Lubbock Lecture in the University of Oxford’s new Mathematical Institute. Over 250 representatives from industry, academia, the University’s alumni community, government, and schools from Oxfordshire attended.
                </DIV><DIV id=""content-core""><DIV id=""parent-fieldname-text"" class=""plain""><P>Dr Kim’s presentation provided fascinating insights into global advances in technology from the last 30 years to those we can expect in the next generation of IT. He highlighted how technological <mark>innovation</mark>s of devices such as televisions, computers and smartphones impact every aspect of our lives from our environment, our education, our leisure time, the way we work and our health. He demonstrated how in future ‘resource scarcity, <mark>climate change</mark> and accelerating urbanisation’ will need to be addressed. Dr Kim’s vision of society in the future is that it will be ‘smarter, healthier and greener as ICT technology continues to be developed’.</P><P>Dr Kim said: “<EM>Technology is a key driving force for socio-economic change. Silicon device technologies continue to evolve. In the future, CMOS (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) technology <mark>innovation</mark> will enable exa-scale (10E18) computing, which is potentially up to human-scale and real-time processing. Silicon scaling technology, which is expected to reach sub-10nm, will enable cost effective ultra-high density memories to satisfy future data storage requirements. Mobile network will open an era of the internet of things where everything could potentially have a digital identity and be connected to the internet and to each other</EM>”.</P><P>He added: “<EM>All these connected objects and devices will generate an exorbitant amount of data (traditional IT data as well as medical/health, bio informatics, environment and so forth), which need to be analysed in order to produce meaningful data. Therefore, Big Data analytics will also be an important technology in the future. Display technology in the future will be more realistic and immersive as well as more intelligent as it has started to become interactive</EM>”.</P><P>In Dr Kim’s closing remarks he said: “<EM>Stakeholders in industry try to push the limits of technology within their capabilities. But they always have to rely on academia for the big breakthroughs that could revolutionise society. Engineers are creators. What they imagine today will be the future of human society</EM>&quot;.</P><P>A profile of Dr. Kim is available via <A title="""" target=""_self"" href=""http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/images/dr-kinam-kim-biography"" class=""internal-link""><SPAN class=""internal-link"">this link</SPAN></A>.</P><P>A <SPAN class=""internal-link"">photo montage of the day</SPAN> is available via <A title="""" target=""_self"" href=""http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/images/lubbock-2014-photo-montage"" class=""internal-link"">this link</A>.</P><P>With special thanks to the Trustees of the Maurice Lubbock Memorial Trust for their continued support.</P><H3 class="" "">Guests at this year’s Lubbock Day also enjoyed two exhibitions…</H3><H3 class="" "">The Undergraduate Project Exhibition by 4th Year Students</H3><DIV style=""float: right; width: 320px;""><SPAN style=""float: right; width: 300px; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;"">Professor Cathy Ye (pictured left) co-ordinated the 4th Year Project Exhibition.

South Korean prosecutors searched offices at a Samsung Electronics Co Ltd unit on Friday as part of a probe into allegations the conglomerate had sabotaged workers’ efforts to strengthen labor unions, the prosecutors’ office said.
The tech giant has often come under fire from politicians and civics groups for not engaging with organized labor and its existing unions tend to be small and weak.
The Seoul Central District Prosecutors office told reporters in a brief text message that it raided Samsung’s repair service unit outside Seoul.

“I think the administration is trying to put a brake on Samsung’s no-union policy, which labor has long criticized,” said Kim Tai-gi, an economics professor at Dankook University, referring to the labour-friendly government of President Moon Jae-in.
Samsung Group, the country’s top family-run business empire, has come under greater scrutiny since heir apparent Jay Y Lee received a suspended jail term in February for bribing a former president.
“Samsung was already cornered in the wake of Jay Y Lee’s case. It does not seem easy for Samsung to stick to the existing stance on unions,” Kim said.
During a bribery probe involving another former president earlier this year, investigators found thousands of documents suggesting the conglomerate had developed union-busting strategies, domestic media outlets reported.
A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman said the company was aware that prosecutors had secured labor-related documents. She declined to comment further on the probe and had no immediate comment on whether a raid had taken place at the unit which carries out repairs for Samsung Electronics products.
Prosecutors investigated similar accusations after a lawmaker disclosed a document in 2013 that she claimed contained Samsung’s guidelines on how to stop its employees from organizing unions.
However, the case was dropped as prosecutors could not verify the source of the document.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd will consider splitting itself into two as proposed by U.S. activist hedge fund Elliott Management, Seoul Economic Daily reported on Monday citing an unnamed source. </P><P> A split would allow the heirs of the founding Lee family to strengthen their grip on the global smartphone leader, the crown jewel of the Samsung Group business empire. Elliott proposed a split in October to boost shareholder value. </P><P> Samsung's board of directors will meet on Tuesday and respond to Elliott's proposals, the newspaper said. The Korea Exchange separately asked Samsung to comment by 6 p.m. (0900 GMT) on whether it planned a spinoff. </P><P> The company did not immediately comment on the newspaper report. </P><P> The hedge fund wants Samsung Electronics to divide into a holding vehicle for ownership purposes and an operating company, pay a $26 billion special dividend, pledge to return at least 75 percent of free cash flow to investors and agree to appoint some independent directors. </P><P> Neither the Lee family nor Samsung Group have commented on restructuring plans, but the conglomerate's reorganization efforts have accelerated since Jay Y. Lee took over the reins after his father and Samsung patriarch Lee Kun-hee was incapacitated following a May 2014 heart attack. </P><P> Samsung has sold non-core assets while pushing through a merger of two affiliates in 2015 to consolidate stakes in key affiliates under a company controlled by Jay Y. Lee and his two sisters, as the founding family moves to secure a stable transfer of control. </P><P> &quot;Even if Samsung Electronics does not comment on specifics such as the timing of a split ... the firm will at least say it will implement ownership structure changes in a reasonable manner,&quot; HI Investment said in a report on Monday. </P><P> (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates) </P></DIV></SECTION></ARTICLE></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

            Investors with $1 trillion put weight behind call for big brands to step up <mark>climate</mark> targets        </H1></HEADER><DIV class=""post-body""><P>Investors managing over $1 trillion USD, coordinated by <A href=""https://shareaction.org/"">ShareAction</A>, are calling on companies around the world to drastically reduce the impact of their operations on the planet, and protect the financial assets they manage from <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Over 60 major shareholders such as Aegon Asset Management, Candriam Investors Group, and Ethos Foundation (a collective of Swiss pension funds) yesterday sent letters to the chief executives of 15 companies including big brands like Morrisons, Netflix, and The Walt Disney Company, and high <mark>carbon</mark> emitters from the power generation and cement sectors.</P><P>The investors in the group, called the Investor De<mark>carbon</mark>isation Initiative, are encouraging the companies they own to set ambitious science-based <mark>climate</mark> targets to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in line with the global Paris Agreement on <mark>climate change</mark>, and to commit to cleaner energy like renewable electricity.</P><P>In the letters, investors say they want ‘to invest in environmentally and financially <mark>sustainable</mark> companies that are prepared for and contributing to the low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy.’</P><P>Momentum behind setting science-based targets is growing, with news today that over 100 companies have now had their targets approved by the <A href=""http://sciencebasedtargets.org/approved-targets-map"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Science Based Targets initiative</A>.</P><P>Sophia McNab, Project Manager at ShareAction, which campaigns for a more responsible investment system, said: “I still hear from some companies that they’ve received no questions from investors on environmental issues. We welcome the leadership of investors in our networks but there is more work to be done by institutional investors. On a personal note, I’d like to see my own pension fund – NEST – championing these issues.”</P><P>Emanuele Fanelli, Responsible Investment Manager at Aegon Asset Management (£279 billion AUM), said: ‘We welcome the momentum behind science-based target setting and are pleased to see that now 100 companies, from Utilities to Real Estate companies across different geographies, currently have approved science-based targets. This encouraging shift from disclosure to action is in the best interests of the environment, society at large, and company long-term investors. In general, there is still a gap between the way companies identify <mark>climate</mark>-related risks and how they are preparing to tackle them. We hope this approach to target setting becomes the new norm and it will advance the implementation of the Paris Agreement.’</P><P>Support from investors can provide vital additional encouragement to companies that recognise the need to prepare for and participate in the low-<mark>carbon</mark> transition. Investors want to hold companies whose business models are aligned with the low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy.</P><P>Isabelle Cabie, Global Head of Responsible Development at Candriam Investors Group, which manages £97 billion, said: “<mark>Climate</mark> risk is now seen as a mainstream risk to financial stability by investors and regulators around the world. It is crucial that this translates into pressure on the most high-<mark>carbon</mark> sectors who are critical in delivering the low-<mark>carbon</mark> transition. As such, we are pleased to be part of collaborative investor initiatives, such as ShareAction’s, which are driving <mark>climate change</mark> up the corporate agenda.”</P><P>Vincent Kaufmann, CEO, at Ethos Foundation which represents the 24 Swiss pension funds (£50 billion AUM) in ShareAction’s investor group, said: “Pension funds, as the guardians of their members’ savings, have an important role to play in the low-<mark>carbon</mark> transition. One way they can do this is to engage businesses, who are the world’s largest users of energy, to drive a faster transition to cleaner alternatives. Collaboration among pension funds and other shareholders can be highly effective and powerful in driving change – investors should continue to engage companies to deliver the ambitions of the Paris Agreement.”</P><P>Companies are facing increasing pressure to disclose and manage <mark>climate</mark>-related risks and opportunities following the Paris Agreement and the work of the Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney’s Task Force on <mark>Climate</mark>-related Financial Disclosures.</P><P>As well as coordinating investor support for science-based targets, ShareAction is also calling on investors to support the shareholder resolution at Shell, asking the company to set Paris-aligned <mark>climate</mark> targets. The vote is another test of investors’ stance on <mark>climate change</mark> issues.</P><P>-ENDS-</P><P>Notes to editors:</P><UL><LI> For more information please contact Beau O’Sullivan on beau.osullivan@shareaction.org or 07950 299 491</LI><LI> Signatories to the letters include: Achmea Investment Management, Adrian Dominican Sisters Portfolio Advisory Board, Aegon Asset Management, Ashden Trust, Australian Ethical Investment, Bank J.

Currently, finding renewable alternatives to conventional petrochemical processes has become one of the major focus areas of the global chemical industry sector. Since over 4.2 million tons of acrylic acid (AA) is annually employed for the manufacture of various products via petrochemical processes, this chemical has been the target of efforts to replace the petrochemical route by ecofriendly processes. However, there has been limited success in developing an approach combining the biological production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) and its chemical conversion to AA. Here, we report the first direct fermentative route for producing 0.12 g/L of AA from glucose via 3-HP, 3-HP-CoA, and Acryloyl-CoA, leading to a strain of Escherichia coli capable of directly producing acrylic acid. This route was developed through extensive screening of key enzymes and designing a novel metabolic pathway for AA.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""keywords""><H4>KEYWORDS: </H4><P>Acrylic acid; Direct fermentation; E. coli; Glucose</P></DIV><DIV class=""aux""><DIV class=""resc""><DL class=""rprtid""><DT>PMID:</DT></DL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

An increase in patent activity from large entities or by foreign entities would be needed to offset this impact.</P><P><SPAN style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><STRONG>Discussion</STRONG></SPAN></P><P>Analysis of the current state of the IP landscape for Green Technology may establish a baseline from which comparisons and conclusions can be drawn. An IP landscape provides insight into the technical developments relative to a technology by analyzing issued patents and published patent applications that are still undergoing examination. The general process for creating an IP landscape involves the use of keywords to identify patent documents that incorporate such keywords in their title, abstract, and/or claims.<SUP>2</SUP> Initially, the keywords are selected to provide a broad data set that globally identifies strategic players, timelines, priority jurisdictions, and key concepts associated with the technology (“Data Mining”). The landscape analysis can then be narrowed to specific technical concepts by incorporating additional keywords that are more focused towards the desired technology (“Text Mining”).<SUP>2</SUP></P><P>Green Technology may be defined as technology capable of reducing or reversing the impact that human activity has on the environment. In this sense, Green Technology includes such concepts as <mark>sustainable</mark> development, energy conservation and management, alternate or renewable energy, and environmental remediation or waste reduction. Within the confines of these concepts, the energy value chain associated with the generation, change, distribution, storage, and usage of energy, may be used to define keywords. Figure 1 lists keywords that can be used to generate an IP landscape.<SUP>3</SUP></P><P align=""center""><STRONG><SPAN style=""font-size: 10px;"">Figure 1. Keywords for Different Sectors in Energy Value Chain.<SUP>3</SUP></SPAN></STRONG></P><P>The energy generation and storage sectors represent important sectors for “Green Technology” because they deal with alternative energy sources and the storage of energy via phase change materials and batteries. Using keywords associated with the energy generation and storage sectors of the energy value chain in a global patent search yields about 1.43 million documents, with the energy storage sector accounting for 72.3% of the documents.</P><P>The patent documents identified for the energy generation sector can be subdivided into the various alternate energy types that define the sector (see pie chart in Figure 2A). Technology development related to solar energy and nuclear energy exhibit the greatest activity over the last two decades, accounting for 43.4% and 30.0% of the documents, respectively. Wind energy is the next largest energy type accounting for 14.6% of the documents, with the other alternative energy types, namely, biofuel, hydropower, geothermal, and solar thermal power accounting for 5% or less of the documents. In comparison, the patent activity associated with fossil fuels over the same time-period is very low, accounting for only 1.2% of the documents.</P><P>The patent documents identified for the energy storage sector can be subdivided into storage concepts relative to thermal energy, chemical energy, and electrical energy that define the sector (see pie chart in Figure 2B). In this sector, technology relevant to batteries accounts for 89.1% of the identified documents, while phase change materials account for another 3.3% of the identified documents.</P><P align=""center""><STRONG><SPAN style=""font-size: 10px;"">Figure 2. Subdivision of Patent Documents in Energy Generation and Energy Storage Sectors</SPAN></STRONG></P><P>The origin of the patent documents may also be determined in the landscape analysis (see timeline in Figure 3). The 1.43 million patent documents identified in the combined energy generation and storage sectors can be reduced into 574,209 patent families (i.e., applications addressing the same invention) in which the first patent application filed determines the country of origin. The number of original patents filed in the four largest economies (US, CN, EP, &amp; JP) were similar in magnitude until about 2004, when the number of patent applications filed in China began to outpace the applications filed in the other jurisdictions. In addition, the number of patent applications filed in the U.S., Europe, and Japan remained relatively constant over the past two decades with a slight peak around 2012-2013, while the number of applications filed in China continued to grow through 2016. Since the number of patent families that originate from foreign jurisdictions (e.g., CN, EP, &amp; JP) greatly exceed the number of inventions originating from the U.S., the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement should not have a substantial impact on the number of patent applications being filed globally.</P><P align=""center""><STRONG><SPAN style=""font-size: 10px;"">Figure 3. Timeline of Patent Families Arising from the Energy Generation and Storage Sectors</SPAN></STRONG></P><P>The owners of patent documents in both the energy generation and storage sectors are discernable from the landscape analysis. For example, in the area of batteries, the five entities having the largest number of patent families assigned to them include Samsung SDI Co. Ltd., Toyota Jidosha KK, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, Sony Corporation, and Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd.  Each of the alternative energy types listed in the energy generation sector exhibit similar results in that the entities owning the largest number of patent families are medium to large multinational companies. Most of these medium/large entities are U.S. or foreign corporations that market products globally and are expected to continue their research and development efforts in Green Technology. Thus, the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement should have minimal impact on research and development in Green Technology conducted by these companies.</P><P>However, the number of filings by small entities or individual inventors may be affected by the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement. Overall, 42,781 entities own one or more of the battery-oriented patent documents. In addition, each of the alternate energy areas in the energy generation sector include a large number of owners. For example, in the areas of solar energy, nuclear, and wind, the number of entities that own one or more patent documents in these areas is 52,314, 28,572, and 30,378, respectively. In fact, even the smallest area in the energy generation sector, i.e., biofuel, includes greater than 4,200 assignees. Thus, in the battery area of the energy storage sector, as well as in the various alternative energy source areas, a significant number of small entities own a limited number of inventions (e.g., 1-3 patent families). The number of small entities or individual inventors that file patent applications within the United States may begin to decrease if a market is not readily available for their product(s).</P><P><STRONG><SPAN style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Endnotes</SPAN></STRONG></P><OL><LI><P>Paris Agreement, United Nations – Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, <U>http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php</U>.</P></LI><LI><P>Weiss, K.; Spink, M., “Intellectual Asset Management – Key Areas to Consider Prior to Product Launch, Proceedings of IEEE TEMSCON 2017, Santa Clara, CA, pages 168-173, June 2017.</P></LI><LI><P>Luther, W., “Application of Nanotechnologies in the Energy Sector”, vol. 9, publisher: HA Hessen Agentur GmbH, Wiesbade, Germany, pages 1-82 (2008).</P></LI></OL><P>Further information regarding “<EM>The Evolving IP Landscape for Green Tech</EM>”, is published by the author in <U>Intellectual Property Magazine</U> (July/August), pages 37-38 (2017).  </P><P><SPAN style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><STRONG>Contact Us</STRONG></SPAN></P><P>If you have any questions or wish to discuss how this decision may impact your business, please contact one of the authors.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""imageContentBlock imageContainer forwardThinker"" data-response=""scroll"" data-tag=""forwardThinker""><DIV class=""sg-row sg-row-pad content maxWidth""><DIV class=""sg-col-lg-12 tranBg""><DIV class=""sg-row""><DIV class=""sg-col-sm-10""><DIV class=""upper tabTitle"">Forward Thinkers</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

                                        request to divert the water on Wednesday, arguing that it only represented “a 0.07 percent increase in total surface water withdrawals from Lake Michigan.” Of the 7 million gallons that will flow to the factory daily, around 2.7 million will be lost mainly through evaporation, and the rest, according to the company, will be treated and then returned to the lake.</P><P>Foxconn was able to obtain the approval more easily thanks to a loophole, according to <A href=""https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/foxconn-lake-michigan/"" target=""_new"" class=""icon "">tech news website Digital Trends</A>. Typically, factories that wish to divert water from Lake Michigan must get the OK from all eight states that surround the Great Lakes. Because Foxconn’s facility, which hasn’t been built yet, will be located outside the boundaries of the Great Lakes Basin, it was able to apply for its water usage simply through a request filed with the city of Racine, Wis., with Wisconsin’s governor, Republican Scott Walker, reportedly <A href=""http://isthmus.com/opinion/citizen-dave/foxconn-is-trouble-for-walker-marquette-law-poll/"" target=""_new"" class=""icon "">facing polling backlash over Foxconn incentives</A>.</P><P>Foxconn, meanwhile, maintains that environmental sustainability is a company priority, noting that it has a code of conduct in place that sets the company’s environmental management standards. The company said in an emailed statement that it plans to optimize its water usage, promote the reuse of wastewater and reclaimed water, and invest in waste treatment technologies. “We take a systematic approach towards integrating green and <mark>sustainable</mark> practices into our global operations,” the company said. “This is the approach and philosophy that we will bring to our Wisconsin operations.” </P><P>Conservation groups including the Sierra Club opposed Foxconn’s water request because it circumvented the multistate agreement that restricts Great Lakes water usage, <A href=""http://www.wisconsingazette.com/news/dnr-approves-racine-s-application-to-divert-lake-michigan-water/article_29a8d8b2-48c5-11e8-9250-07febd339297.html"" target=""_new"" class=""icon "">the Wisconsin Gazette reported</A>. Furthermore, environmental activists worried the approval could set a precedent for similar requests in the future. As of 2016, only 10.8% of water withdrawn from the Great Lakes was used for industrial purposes, according to the <A href=""https://waterusedata.glc.org/pdf/2016-Water-Use-Report-Final.pdf"" target=""_new"" class=""icon "">Great Lakes Commission</A> — comparatively, nearly two-thirds of the water diverted goes to power plants.</P><P>Foxconn’s water use is just the latest example of how smartphones cost Planet Earth.</P><H6>Consumers are churning through smartphones</H6><P>There have been 7.1 billion smartphones manufactured since 2007, according to Greenpeace — enough to equip nearly every person in the world with a device. Yet newer devices like the iPhone X continue to be produced as consumers seek out updated and improved models.</P><P>“It’s magnifying the problem very significantly,” said Alex Sebastian, co-founder of Orchard, a Canadian company that resells smartphones. “If you look at a computer, most people use it until it’s unusable. But people have gotten used to new updates to the phone every one to two years.”</P><P><STRONG>Don’t miss:</STRONG><A href=""/story/how-to-build-your-own-paris-agreement-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change-in-your-own-home-2017-06-02"" class=""icon none"">11 ways to build a Paris <mark>climate change</mark> accord — in your own community</A></P><P>It’s largely thanks to the pace at which companies like Apple

                          </CITE></FOOTER></BLOCKQUOTE><H6><mark>Carbon</mark> emissions is another smartphone-related problem</H6><P>Additionally, the vast majority (73%) of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide associated with smart devices is emitted during manufacturing, according to Greenpeace. “It’s not possible to make an electronic device that’s environmentally friendly,” said Kyle Wiens, CEO of <A href=""https://www.ifixit.com/"" target=""_new"" class=""icon "">iFixit</A>. “We’re very far away from that.”</P><P>Apple has taken steps to reduce its environmental footprint. The company is investing in methods to recover materials from its products and works to encourage customers to return products through <A href=""https://www.apple.com/recycling/"" target=""_new"" class=""icon "">its recycling program Apple Renew</A>. Apple customers who donate qualifying devices through that program are eligible to receive a gift card. The company is also working to use more recycled materials in its manufacturing — for instance, Apple said it’s transitioning to using 100% recycled tin solder for logic boards in the iPhone 6s.</P><P>Despite that progress, some believe Apple could be doing more to address its environmental impact. The choice to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 likely added further to e-waste as older earbuds became obsolete without a new adapter, Wiens said.</P><P>The AirPods wireless earbuds are powered by a rechargeable battery — but Wiens said that battery cannot be replaced. Traditional headphones use wiring and magnets that are easily recyclable, he said. (Apple did not return a request for comment regarding this matter.)</P><H6>There are ways to extend the life of your smartphone</H6><P>Consumers can take steps to ensure their smartphone use is as environmentally sound as possible. Putting the phone on airplane mode whenever feasible will conserve energy and extend the battery’s life — as will making sure that the device does not overheat when charging.</P><P>Additionally, smartphones can outlive their original batteries. Consumers can take a device to the original retailer, get the battery replaced by an independent repair shop or even do it themselves. Old batteries can be disposed of at many hardware stores and electronics retailers such as Best Buy, Wiens added. (Consumers should check their warranty before going to an independent repair shop or making fixes themselves, however.)</P><P>“The best thing you can do with your phone is not to let it sit in a drawer or throw it out but to sell it immediately,” said Wiens. Not taking that action opens a door to the risk that the device will get too out-of-style to be refurbished, meaning it could become 100% e-waste. For those who don’t want to exert the effort of researching prices and selling their used phone, Sebastian recommended contacting charities. Many charitable organizations will give previously owned smart devices to people in need if the device is still working, ensuring an extended life for it.</P><P><STRONG>Read more:</STRONG><A href=""/story/10-years-later-some-people-are-still-holding-onto-their-original-iphones-2017-01-09"" class=""icon none"">This 2007 iPhone will cost you 10 times more than the rumored iPhone X</A></P><P>As for recycling, consumers are best off going through major retailers such as <A href=""http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Global-Promotions/Recycling-Electronics/pcmcat149900050025.c?id=pcmcat149900050025"" target=""_new"" class=""icon "">Best Buy</A><SPAN class=""quote down bgQuote"" data-channel=""/quotes/zigman/219712/composite"" data-bgformat=""""><A class=""qt-chip trackable"" data-fancyid=""XNYSStockBBY"" href=""/investing/stock/bby"" data-track-mod=""MW_story_quote"">BBY, <SPAN class=""bgPercentChange"">-0.67%</SPAN></A></SPAN>

For starters, smartphones represent only a fraction of the electronic waste that’s been produced historically. Plus, they use fewer materials (as compared with items like cathode-ray televisions). And because smartphones can perform many functions, they have replaced the need to have separate devices such as an MP3 player and a digital camera, meaning fewer materials are being used overall.</P><P>Scientists are also <A href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/10/25/end-smashed-smartphones-scientists-invent-super-flexy-touchscreen/"" target=""_new"" class=""icon "">researching ways</A> to make the glass in smartphones more smash-resistant. </P><P>And while there is room for improvement where recycling is concerned, consumer electronics have the fastest growing recycling rate of any product category in the United States, <A href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-11/documents/2014_smm_tablesfigures_508.pdf"" target=""_new"" class=""icon "">according to a report from the Environmental Protection Agency</A>. </P><P><EM>This story was updated on April 30, 2018.</EM></P><DIV class=""module"" id=""related-articles""><STRONG>More from MarketWatch</STRONG></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It is not possible to cover all of these topics in this report.
The following is a selection.
The companies we engaged in a dialogue in 2015, and the type of topics that were discussed are shown in the overview at the end of this chapter.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""vvb-item"" id=""milieu-en-klimaatverandering""><DIV class=""typo""><H2>Environment and <mark>climate change</mark></H2><P>We expect companies to have good insight into the environmental risks they run and a policy on how to deal with them. The greatest risk at the moment, which affects almost all of our investments, is <mark>climate change</mark>. In particular, it is vital that energy companies and companies with high <mark>CO2</mark> emissions respond to this. Real estate can also play a significant role in reducing emissions.</P><H4>Shell and the Arctic</H4><P>We publicly expressed our doubts about the plans of Anglo-Dutch oil company Shell to drill for oil in the Arctic at its shareholders’ meeting in the spring. This was held shortly after the United States government had given permission for trial drilling. Partly on the basis of information from environmental organization Greenpeace and specialists in the oil world, we had serious doubts about the risks of the project, both for the environment and for the shareholders. These doubts were not dispelled by a visit by one of our staff to the drilling area. We notified Shell that it could do better by developing gas and oil fields off the coast of Brazil. We were, therefore, happy when Shell announced after initial drilling that it would end activities in the Arctic.</P><H4>Fracking</H4><P>The Disclosing the facts survey published at the end of 2015 showed that oil and gas companies are increasingly following the guidelines we adopted some years ago, on extracting shale gas and oil. Disclosing the facts reports each year on how the thirty largest oil and gas companies that use fracking<SUP>13 </SUP>provide information to investors on,
for example, the use of toxic chemicals, emissions of waste gases, water consumption and the effect on local communities. This was discussed with eight companies in 2015 and all but one displayed clear progress in the latest report.</P><H4>Divestment from coal</H4><P>We have asked the Chinese wind energy company Longyuan to reconsider its coal activities (about 10% of the total) and investigate whether a complete transition to renewable energy would be more attractive. We expect this would increase the value of the company as coal currently generates poor returns and involves risks. The company
has not yet done this but the discussions continue.</P><H4>Voting for <mark>CO2</mark> reductions</H4><P>Along with other investors<SUP>14 </SUP> we have worked on resolutions for the shareholders’ meetings of mining companies Glencore, Rio Tinto and Anglo American that will be voted on in 2016. We want these companies to report more clearly on the amounts of <mark>CO2</mark> they emit, how they link the reduction targets to their remuneration policy, how they are responding to possible new <mark>climate policy</mark> from governments and their lobbying in this area. Last year we voted in favor of similar shareholders’ resolutions at Shell and BP. Both resolutions were accepted by their boards.</P><P>We voted against a shareholders’ resolution at Apple calling for more insight into the risks it faces as a result of possible national, state and local government measures on <mark>climate change</mark>. Apple already provides sufficient information on this.</P><P>In total we voted on over 100 shareholders’ resolutions on environmental subjects, supporting about two-thirds of them. Consequently most resolutions on combating <mark>climate change</mark> and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could count on our vote. Most votes against (28) were exercised in Japan where far-reaching resolutions on ending nuclear energy and moving to renewable sources were presented at several meetings. Although we support the transition to <mark>sustainable</mark> energy, in our opinion these resolutions were not the right way of approaching this. Some specified what management had to do in excessive detail, others would have meant, in practice, a prohibition on the use of nuclear energy.</P><P><SUB>13. In fracking, oil and gas is extracted from hard shale after it has been cracked by injecting large quantities of water, sand and chemicals into the ground.
14. We are working with the Aiming for A coalition, which is in dialogue with the ten largest listed mining and utilities companies in the United Kingdom to encourage them to reduce their <mark>CO2</mark> emissions.</SUB></P><P> </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""vvb-item"" id=""mensenrechten""><DIV class=""typo""><H2>Human Rights</H2><P>The UN Global Compact, which is one of the foundations of our responsible investment approach, states that companies may not be complicit in breaches of human rights. They also have to avoid their activities leading or contributing to them.</P><H4>No drugs for the death penalty</H4><P>We sold our shares in American pharmaceutical company Mylan after it did not meet our request to ensure its muscle relaxants could not be used in carrying out the death penalty. We contacted the company on the back of information from an NGO on the use of its rocuronium bromide in executions in the United States. Mylan then stated on its website that its products were not intended for use in executions. The company did not want to clarify measures it had taken to prevent actual use in executions or whether it delivered muscle relaxants to American prisons that could use them in the death penalty. In a later discussion, Mylan stated its delivery contracts include a clause on unintended use of its products. That was not sufficient for us as there is no check on compliance.</P><H4>Preventing repeated problems</H4><P>At our request, the British-Danish security company G4S published more information on how it applied its human rights policy and what it had learned from complaints by stakeholders on activities in Israel, Cuba and Papua-New Guinea. It also announced a centralization of complaints procedures so management can identify possible
malpractice at the local level more quickly. Oil company Chevron responded positively to our suggestion to centralize complaints procedures.</P><P>The Chinese mining company Zijin Mining, which suspended operations in Peru after fierce protests by local people, has committed to examine the possibility of a complaints procedure so people affected can express their concerns to the company. This has not yet led to clear results. We will continue monitoring this.</P><H4>Operations in disputed territory</H4><P>Oil company Total explained to us how it dealt with different people in Western Sahara who strive for independence from Morocco, which regards the region as part of its territory. The French company had been licensed by the Moroccan government to search for oil off the coast of Western Sahara. We wanted to be certain that Total was acting in line with international regulations on disputed territories which state that the interests of the local population must be served when extracting commodities and that they should benefit from the proceeds.
Total explained the discussions it had with the local communities. Arrangements had been made on sharing any future revenues equitably. A few months after our talks, Total announced it had not renewed the licenses and is no longer operating in Western Sahara.</P><H4>Voting on human rights and labor rights resolutions</H4><P>We voted in favor of six resolutions on human and labor rights at the shareholders’ meetings of nineteen companies. We supported resolutions at Caterpillar (machinery manufacturer), Kroger (supermarket chain) and T-Mobile US (telecoms) for more information on measures to combat violations of human rights. We did not support similar resolutions at Facebook, Amazon.com and eleven other companies because in our opinion they already do enough and additional obligations would involve an unnecessary burden. Resolutions on human and labor rights are, however, less than 2% of all resolutions that shareholders submitted in 2015 at the meetings of companies in which we hold shares.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""vvb-item"" id=""fatsoenlijke-arbeidsomstandigheden""><DIV class=""typo""><H2>Working conditions</H2><P>We want employees of companies we invest in to be free to join trade unions and bargain collectively on working conditions. Child labor, forced labor and discrimination on the shop floor are not acceptable. A good personnel policy can enhance the value of an investment.</P><H4>Safe ports</H4><P>LBC Tank Terminals amended its safety policy after we had suggested this. Following a fatal accident in the Port of Rotterdam in 2014, the oil and chemicals bulk storage company made central arrangements for safety regulations that apply to all ports where it has operations.
A new three-year program should ensure that its safety performance is better than at similar companies. A special management committee, on which we are represented, will monitor this. During a visit to the LBC site in Antwerp, one of our specialists saw how the safety regulations are being applied.</P><H4>Engaged employees</H4><P>APG, along with supermarket chains Ahold and Sainsbury’s, contributed to an investors’ manual for the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) to encourage retail chains to be more open about their personnel policy. According to the PRI, satisfied and engaged employees are good for a business as they stay longer and on average are more productive. The investors who drew up the PRI manual want retail chains to give more information on, for example, staff turnover and training.</P><P>The Indian hotel chain Lemon Tree, of which APG owns about 15%, has won the Asian Human Capital Award. The company (twenty-five hotels in sixteen towns) received the award since it actively employs people who are deaf or hard of hearing, or have Downs syndrome. About 11% of the chain’s 3,200 staff are people with physical or learning disabilities. Four years ago this was 6%. The Asian Human Capital Award is made each year to two companies in Asia with an innovative personnel policy that sets an example
to other companies.</P><H4>Good work in the clothing and textile sector</H4><P>We discussed sustainability performance with a fashion brand we invest in through one of our private equity funds. This brand came bottom of a Dutch NGO’s list because it provided no information at all on working conditions in its clothing factories or its environmental policy. Since we, as an investor (limited partner), have no direct contact
with the companies in our private equity funds, we made a visit with the manager (general partner). After we had established that the company does much more than it discloses, it said it would publish more.</P><P>At our suggestion, clothing company H&amp;M contacted a factory in Burma which subcontracted work to a company not on the list of approved suppliers on the H&amp;M site.
APG found out about the supplier at the end of 2014 during a working visit to clothing factories in Burma and Bangladesh. H&amp;M, which is in the lead internationally in providing information on its factories and suppliers, tightened its internal procedures. It also organized a workshop for its factories in Burma on why it is so important to be transparent about the companies involved in clothing production.</P><P>We also spoke to the Spanish fashion group Inditex (parent of Zara and other companies) and the Chinese company Li &amp; Fung about tighter supervision of working conditions in the production chain.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""vvb-item"" id=""gedrag-en-cultuurverandering""><DIV class=""typo""><H2>Conduct and culture change</H2><P>Metal and commodities company Glencore published its policy on corruption, signed up to the principles in the UN Global Compact, reviewed its internal code of conduct and announced an external board evaluation. APG had been in discussion with the Swiss-British company on these and other subjects for some years. We will continue to talk to Glencore, which generates a large part of its revenues from coal mining, about how it is responding to <mark>climate change</mark> and monitoring safety at work.</P><P>Oil company Cobalt has issued its first sustainability report. This American company was accused of corruption in its activities in Angola and was investigated by the American judicial authorities and the regulator, the SEC. Although it is still currently managing them, Cobalt has since sold its Angolan assets and so runs fewer risks.</P><H4>Culture change at Volkswagen</H4><P>We have urged Volkswagen to work on a change of culture following the scandal with the “defeat software” it used to manipulate the <mark>CO2</mark> emissions of its diesel cars in the United States. A more open culture is needed to hold the company’s senior managers more accountable for inappropriate behavior and strategy. We also want Volkswagen to find new directors who can operate more independently.</P><P>APG is also in talks with companies about their corporate governance to stay ahead of issues. At our request, Chinese real estate company Dalian Wanda set up a whistle-blowers’ scheme and appointed a chief financial officer with responsibility for the financial policy of the rapidly-growing Wanda Group, which includes cinemas, shopping centers and a yacht builder.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""vvb-item"" id=""bestuurders-met-oog-voor-aandeelhouders""><DIV class=""typo""><H2>Directors with an eye for shareholders</H2><P>We attach great value to a properly functioning board with a varied composition, a clear division of executive and super-visory duties and sufficient independent directors who safeguard the interests of minority shareholders such as pension funds.</P><H4>European Shareholder Rights Directive</H4><P>Following pressure from us, the European Parliament rejected a proposal in the new Shareholder Rights Directive to grant additional rights to investors who have held the shares in their portfolio for at least two years. Along with other institutional investors, we set out our objections to the European Commission and the European Parliament. The final Shareholder Rights Directive, which is expected to be adopted in 2016, is a step in the right direction, since for example investors everywhere will soon be able to vote on remuneration policies. The directive is unlikely to have significant effects in the Netherlands.</P><H4>Unequal voting rights in France and Italy</H4><P>We and other investors have asked seventy-one French companies to prevent long-term shareholders receiving double voting rights. The Florange law, which came into force in 2014, means that these rights are granted automatically to investors who have held shares in a company continuously for two years unless that company explicitly decides not to implement this (an opt-out). We are against double voting rights as they give some shareholders disproportionate control. They also allow the French government to sell a large proportion of its shareholdings without losing influence. A majority voted in favor of an opt-out at nineteen of the twenty-five companies prepared to put a resolution to their shareholders. This strengthened our position as a shareholder.</P><P>We made a similar request to the 100 largest Italian listed companies. Unlike in France, double voting rights are not automatic in Italy but since 2014 it has been possible for
a company to put such a resolution to its shareholders (an opt-in). Despite our request, seven of the companies approached did put an opt-in on the agenda and the resolution was passed in all cases.</P><H4>Swedish corporate governance code</H4><P>We believe it is important that individual directors can be held accountable so we asked the committee overseeing the revision of the Swedish corporate governance code to end the practice of shareholders’ meetings voting on all directors together in a joint resolution. Along with other investors we wrote to forty Swedish companies to request that directors stand individually. In early 2016, a number of companies (telecoms company Ericsson, Swedbank and Handelsbanken) said they will do this. The committee does not currently want to accept our request. We will continue to urge this.</P><H4>Guidance for company boards in Japan</H4><P>The Japanese government has introduced a corporate governance code that APG and other investors had been advocating for years. The code will contribute to a change of culture that will make companies more transparent and pay greater attention to minority shareholders. Along with other institutional investors, we visited ten companies to examine how they are applying the code. Discussions were held on this with the Japanese financial markets regulator and the government pension fund, which, as the largest pension fund in the world, can exercise huge influence.</P><P>Nine of the thirty-three large Japanese companies we wrote to, explaining why we wanted to see a third of the members of their directors being non-executives, have increased the independence on their board. This is a major step in a country where non-executive directors were unknown until recently. Japan is our principal Asian market, in ninth place on a list of countries where we invest, just above China.</P><H4>Discrimination against non-Japanese investors</H4><P>We voted against the introduction of new shares with guaranteed proceeds and voting rights at the shareholders’ meeting of Toyota Motor Corporation. These “AA shares” would only be available to Japanese investors. APG was against this since it was excluded as a foreign investor and could be put at a disadvantage as a holder of normal shares. The request to remove this resolution from the agenda was not honored.</P><H4>Controversial merger in South Korea</H4><P>We voted against the merger of Korean companies Samsung Construction &amp; Trading and Cheil (advertising and marketing). The reason for this was that Cheil wanted to pay far too little for the shares in Samsung Construction &amp; Trading, which, like Cheil, has close ties with Samsung Electronics. APG as a shareholder would lose some €21 million as a result. As over two-thirds of the shareholders agreed to the acquisition by Cheil, the merger went ahead.</P><P>During a subsequent enquiry into this matter by the Korean parliament, our Asian corporate governance specialist explained why we voted against the merger, while the Korean civil service pension fund NPS voted in favor. APG had announced in advance in local and international media (New York Times, Bloomberg Business News) why it was against the merger. In early 2016, the Samsung Group announced that it will strengthen the independence of the boards of its subsidiaries.</P><H4>Approved financial statements</H4><P>We wrote to twenty-two South Korean companies asking them to distribute the financial statements approved by the auditors before the shareholders’ meeting. In Korea it is usual only to issue provisional figures in advance and to present the final figures at the meeting itself. This is not practical for us as we usually vote remotely and have to approve the board’s policy in advance of the meeting. We have been working on this for over two years. About ten companies have now complied with our request.
We will write to the others again in 2016.</P><H4>Sound remuneration policy</H4><P>As in 2014, we looked critically at the remuneration of the directors of the companies in our equities portfolio.
In 2015, we voted on over 1,730 remuneration resolutions at some 1,600 shareholders’ meetings. We voted slightly more often against (54%) than in favor (45%). We cast
the same percentage of votes against in 2014, when we abstained slightly more often. The main reasons for voting against were excessively generous severance packages, inadequate links between payment and performance, and opaque schemes. Resolutions linking pay to challenging performance that makes a sufficient contribution to the strategic long-term targets of a company could in general rely on our support.</P><H4>Greater shareholder influence</H4><P>Ahold withdrew a proposal to reduce the number of members of its management board from three to two. A resolution to make this possible was removed from the agenda of the shareholders’ meeting after we urged this. Ahold wanted to place responsibility with executives just below board level. These executives are not supervised by the supervisory board or elected by the shareholders.</P><P>We supported resolutions to allow shareholders to nominate directors (proxy access) at some eighty shareholders’ meetings in the United States. In the Netherlands, holders of at least 3% of the shares are already able to nominate candidates for the board. Companies in the United States have resisted this for some time out of fear of shareholders with detrimental intentions. Several companies, including pharmaceutical company Pfizer, General Electric and DTE Energy, introduced proxy access last year after we had raised the subject with them.</P><P>American real estate company, Vornado (with several stores in the center of New York) announced it would listen more to its shareholders. For years, the company was
run by directors who had not received a majority at shareholders’ meetings. Shareholders’ resolutions to change the board structure were passed but not followed by the board. From 2018, Vornado directors who do not receive a majority of votes must offer their resignation to the other directors (who will then decide).</P><H4>Clear divisions between executives and supervision</H4><P>After we (and other investors) had urged this, Bank of America (BoA) submitted its plan to unite the roles of chairman and CEO to its shareholders for approval. Before the financial crisis, both roles were held by the same person at BoA. They were separated after shareholder pressure. This year the company wanted to return to the old situation without asking the shareholders’ approval. We are not only against one person having both the role of CEO and of chairman but also believe that a company may not reverse a decision of its shareholders without consulting them. BoA obtained the support of a majority of the shareholders at a special shareholders’ meeting although there was a substantial minority (40%) against. We wrote setting out our objections against combining the roles once again and will return to this in 2016.</P><H4>More independence and more female directors</H4><P>We have been discussing the membership of the board of British property company Derwent London, which owns many office blocks in the center of London, for some years. Only a third of the company’s directors were independent in 2013. Last year, after it appointed more independent directors this had grown to half.</P><P>Talks have been held with several French companies about the need to have more women on boards. French legislation states that 40% of directors must be women from 2016. Vacancies cannot be filled until this percentage is reached. We are not currently aware of any companies where a problem has arisen because they have been unable to find suitable candidates.</P><H4>New governance structure after dubious transaction</H4><P>After sharp criticism from APG and others, Hyundai Motor Company altered its board structure, setting up a separate governance committee just below the board specifically
to monitor the interests of minority shareholders. An independent director has also been appointed. Both have a clear role in major investment decisions.The criticism from the shareholders, which we expressed at the shareholders’ meeting in March, was prompted by the purchase of an expensive piece of land in the Seoul district of Gangnam after which the share price fell sharply. APG believed that the roughly $10 billion spent on this should have been distributed to the shareholders.</P><H4>Voting on appointments of directors</H4><P>Overall we voted on over 18,000 directors at over 2,600 shareholders’ meetings in 2015, supporting almost 85% of the nominations. We voted against 9% of the candidates who, for example, were not sufficiently independent or already held too many directorships. We abstained or no vote was submitted in 6% of cases. These percentages are almost the same as those for 2013 and 2014.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""vvb-item"" id=""overzicht-alle-dialogen""><DIV class=""typo""><H2>All engagements in 2015</H2><P>During 2015, specialists of our sustainability and governance team engaged with 199 listed companies on sustainability and governance.

He and a small team would ski 600 miles to the Geographic South Pole using only renewable energy. Their thesis: If it could be achieved in the highest, driest and windiest place on Earth, there is potential to utilize renewable energy anywhere in the world.</P><P>Swan describes the journey in an exclusive interview with Global GoalsCast (<A href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/global-goalscast/id1329524900?mt=2"">“Journey Across Antarctica: the Swans and <mark>Climate Change</mark>”</A>), a new podcast that profiles bold individuals’ efforts toward achieving the 17 UN <A href=""https://www.globalgoals.org/""><mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals</A> by the year 2030.</P><P>The podcast episode launches today at the <A href=""http://dld-conference.com/DLD18"">DLD conference</A> in Munich, at a panel titled “The Power of Podcast.”</P><P>Swan and his son and fellow explorer, Barney, will speak live with Global Goalscast co-hosts <A href=""https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/21234-meet-claudia-romo-edelman-thrive-global-editor-at-large-a-woman-with-a-plan-for-our-planet-because-there-s-no-planet-b"">Claudia Romo Edelman</A> and <A href=""http://edielush.com/about/"">Edie Lush</A> on January 25 at the World Economic Forum.</P><P>Robert, 61 and the first man ever to walk to both the North and South Poles Swan, said he couldn’t keep up. While he didn’t have health or equipment issues and could ski an impressive 10 nautical miles each day, he couldn’t sustain the 12 to 14nm required to reach the South Pole and test all the technology before the Antarctic winter began.</P><P>Robert reports to the Global GoalsCast that the he encountered an unprecedented “pie crust-like” ice texture in Antarctica that made it more difficult to traverse than in past expeditions. Swan acknowledges that while there is no official scientific conclusion proving the cause of the altered ice conditions, the change could be presumably related to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P><EM>“The surfaces across which we were travelling were surfaces none of us have ever experienced before. Not just me, five of the top polar travelers in the world who are making journeys in Antarctica have all commented on the fact that the surfaces this year in Antarctica are different than they’ve ever been before…We believe – all of us – that it is a sign that we are changing even in the coldest parts of Antarctica,” Robert said.</EM></P><P>The eight-week Antarctic expedition aimed to highlight to younger generations that there is no silver bullet to the challenge of <mark>climate change</mark>. It is up to all players in society – including including governments, industry, entrepreneurs and corporations – to work together to develop cleaner energy solutions.</P><P>Barney, 23, took the baton from his father and completed the challenge. Robert believes his son’s courage “will resonate and inspire young people to act and say, ‘My God, I’m going to make an effort myself.’</P><P><EM>“Our effort, yes, is extreme, but it gives us is a story that underlines and hopefully inspires people to make change because we cannot carry on as we are. The way that we are living is not <mark>sustainable</mark>. If we can survive here [in Antarctica] on renewable energy than we can do that anywhere on the planet – and that is the message,” Robert said.</EM><EM> </EM></P><P>Robert ultimately rejoined the team at the 89th parallel and completed the last 60 miles to the Geographic South Pole.</P><P>As the official sound of Global GoalsCast, HARMAN provides financial support as well as AKG microphones, and JBL and Harman Kardon headphones to help capture and communicate dramatic stories that will educate and engage listeners around the world.</P><P>“HARMAN is a connected technologies company with a mission to elevate experiences for people no matter where they are,” said Dinesh C.

The platform is designed to accommodate a wide range of automated driving requirements, from ADAS and scaling upwards to support full autonomy.</P><P>
DRVLINE hardware is architected to be scalable, with a baseboard that acts as a functionally safe gateway to the vehicle, and expansion boards that can be stacked on top of the baseboard. The expansion boards provide additional compute, specialized SOCs, Accelerators, and also increase the number and variety of sensors supported. They can incrementally support more advanced ADAS and Autonomous features as the system requirements grow.
</P></DIV><DIV class=""entry-more font-entrybody""><P>
DRVLINE builds upon and extends the AUTOSAR Adaptive platform, and runs on any POSIX OS.
</P><P>With DRVLINE, Samsung is positioning itself as a partner for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) and Mobility as a Service (MaaS) providers in the autonomous driving market.</P><P>Many hardware and software autonomous driving platforms force the user to adopt particular technology as an all-or-nothing black-box package. The DRVLINE platform however, has been designed so vendors can collaborate and the software can be customized or enhanced and individual components and technologies can be swapped in and out as needed. This also helps future-proof the platform—an essential consideration in such a fast-changing industry: OEMs can market the most advanced existing autonomous technology, while incorporating new <mark>innovation</mark>s as they work toward Level 5 automation.</P><P>

The DRVLINE platform incorporates several best-in-class components and technologies, which leverage Samsung’s global expertise in electronics, IoT, and embedded systems, including in-car compute for Levels 3, 4, and 5 automation. It also includes a new ADAS forward-facing camera system, created by Samsung and HARMAN, which is engineered to meet upcoming New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) standards. These include lane departure warning, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, and automatic emergency braking.</P><P>

Samsung appears at CES alongside several of its partners in ADAS and autonomous driving. As part of its strategy of open <mark>innovation</mark> and collaboration, the company has engaged a robust ecosystem of partners across the industry, including:</P><UL><LI>Software: TTTech, AImotive, Hella Aglaia, Renovo Auto</LI><LI>In-Car Compute: Graphcore, ThinCi, Infineon</LI><LI>Communications: Autotalks, Valens</LI><LI>Sensors: Quanergy, Tetravue, Oculii, Innoviz</LI></UL><P>
Samsung’s announcement at CES, comes after a year of firsts for the company. These include: an $8 billion acquisition of connected technologies company HARMAN and the creation of a joint automotive Strategic Business Unit; the establishment of a $300-million Samsung Automotive <mark>Innovation</mark> Fund; and a series of investments and partnerships designed to promote collaboration in the automotive sector.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

    			</DIV></DIV><DIV class=""artText""><DIV class=""section1""><DIV class=""Normal"">MUMBAI: Electronic goods companies, including multinationals that have been operating in India for at least a decade, could see pressure on profit due to a proposed rule on electronic waste disposal and its treatment under current accounting standards. Companies such as <A href=""/topic/Samsung"" target=""_blank"">Samsung</A>, <A href=""/topic/LG"" target=""_blank"">LG</A>, <A href=""/topic/Apple"" target=""_blank"">Apple</A> and <A href=""/topic/Nokia"" target=""_blank"">Nokia</A> will be required to collect a predetermined percentage of the goods they sell every year, stretching back over the past 10 years.
Under Indian Account Standards (Ind-AS), the companies will be required to provision for this cost in the current fiscal, leading to a possible erosion in earnings. They have asked the Ministry of Environment, Forests and <mark>Climate Change</mark> to amend the rule and strip out its retrospective nature.
E-waste includes mobile phones, tablets, computers, television sets, washing machines and refrigerators. The regulations also indicate the life span of a product— such as five years for mobile phones and 10 years for washing machines.
If the rules are put in place without changes, companies may look to pass on the costs to consumers, experts said, estimating that prices could rise 1-4% in that case.
<STRONG>Later Entrants Would Benefit</STRONG>“ACE (appliance and consumer electronic) and phone makers could have significant financial implications on their books as they will have to provision for e-waste they collect on their last eight to 10 years’ sales,” said Manish Sharma, president of the Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (<A href=""/topic/CEAMA"" target=""_blank"">CEAMA</A>).
“Under the current Indian accounting standards (Ind-AS), the entire provision for such obligation must be booked in the first year, which makes the rules retrospective.”The lobby group has said the rules should be prospective as this will promote ease of doing business, Sharma said. CEAMA had asked the ministry to reconsider the draft rule in a December 14 letter. “There is a year-wise liability for past sales going back to 10 years (for electronic goods manufacturers). Under prevailing accounting rules, any obligation of a retrospective nature must be accounted in the year from when law takes effect,” it said. “This places unimaginable financial burden on the companies.”A South Korean consumer goods company executive told ET that this has emerged as one of its main concerns this year, especially since later entrants would benefit.
“We operate on wafer-thin margins and such a provisioning could potentially impact the bottom line heavily,” he said.
“We already have a strict e-waste policy but the accounting implication would not benefit us and would put some of the other late entrants in the segment from China in a better position.”Accounting experts said provisioning has to be made in the current financial year for most consumer goods companies. “Due to the new requirements, many consumer goods companies will have to make a provision for the cost of meeting the e-waste collection targets, which in turn is linked to the past sales of the product and its expected life,” said Sai Venkateshwaran, head of accounting advisory services at <A href=""/topic/KPMG"" target=""_blank"">KPMG</A> in India. “As per Indian accounting standards, this provision needs to be made taking into account sales of past periods, and this impact will come in the current fiscal which would impact the bottom line of a company.”Putting a number on the exact cost will be difficult and depend on the company.
“I would say for every Rs 5,000 crore of sales, the estimated cost could be anywhere around 1% to 4% of the cost,” said an accounting expert helping some companies. “So it would come to Rs 50 crore to Rs 200 crore per year for a company with such revenue.”The multinationals have asked accounting experts to arrive at provisioning estimates.
“We have already made substantial capital expenditure in India. Now how do I go back to global (headquarters) and say we will make losses this year due to e-waste provisioning,” said the finance head of a multinational consumer goods company. The company has also commissioned an estimate of the cost.
To be sure, there are some experts who said there is ambiguity over the retrospective element.
“While the percentage of collection for each product is mentioned by in the October draft notification, there is still no clarity on whether the collection targets are for past or just for sales going ahead for the companies,” said Sandip Khetan, partner in a member firm of EY Global. “Because if it’s retrospective then companies may have to provision the present value of future obligation for applicable past period sales, something on the lines of how warranty provision is treated in the books.”Estimates costs won’t be easy for companies.
“It will be difficult for companies to estimate both the quantum of historical e-waste as well as the related costs associated with this obligation,” said Venkateshwaran of KPMG. “Companies that have been in existence for over five-ten years and have had significant sales during this period are likely to see a greater impact on their P&amp;L this year due to the provisioning.”An e-waste company head said costs won’t be as high as companies fear.
“The cost of managing e-waste is not as high as some people claim,” said BK Soni, chairman, Eco Recycling Ltd (Ecoreco), an e-waste management company. “These norms are the need of the hour and I think they are in line with global e-waste management norms.”</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""clearfix sharingBox shareVert bottom"" data-share_msid=""62215052""><DIV class=""flt comment_count"" onclick=""commentBox.show(62215052);"" data-msid=""62215052""><SPAN>0</SPAN>Comments

</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></HEADER><DIV class=""content__article-body from-content-api js-article__body"" itemprop=""articleBody"" data-test-id=""article-review-body""><P>The US president, Donald Trump, has announced steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels, giving a boost to Whirlpool Corp and dealing a setback to the renewable energy industry in the first of several potential trade restrictions. </P><P>The decisions in the two “Section 201” safeguard cases followed findings by the US International Trade Commission (ITC) that both imported products “are a substantial cause of serious injury to domestic manufacturers,” US trade representative Robert Lighthizer said. </P><P>The washer tariffs exceeded the harshest recommendations from ITC members, while the solar tariffs were lower than domestic producers had hoped for. The restrictions aim to help domestic manufacturers but drew complaints that consumer costs for new washers and solar installations will rise. </P><P> Trump will impose a 20% tariff on the first 1.2m imported large residential washers in the first year, and a 50% tariff on machines above that number. The tariffs decline to 16% and 40% respectively in the third year. </P><P>A 30% tariff will be imposed on imported solar cells and modules in the first year, with the tariffs declining to 15% by the fourth year. The tariff allows 2.5 gigawatts of unassembled solar cells to be imported tariff-free in each year. </P><P>Whirlpool, which sought the washers “safeguard” action against rivals Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics after years of anti-dumping cases, saw its shares rise 1.8% in after-hours trade. </P><P>“By enforcing our existing trade laws, President Trump has ensured American workers will compete on a level playing field with their foreign counterparts,” Whirlpool chairman, Jeff Fettig, said.</P><P>The move punishes Samsung, which recently began washer production in South Carolina, and LG, which is building a washer factory in Tennessee. </P><P>“This tariff is a tax on every consumer who wants to buy a washing machine. Everyone will pay more, with fewer choices,” Samsung said in a statement. LG Electronics said that the decision will hinder the ramp-up and employment prospects of its new plant, which will not begin production until late 2018 or early 2019. </P><P>Trump ignored a recommendation from the ITC to exclude South Korean-produced washers from LG from the tariffs, as prior anti-dumping duties on these machines have been dropped. The decision could also hurt retailer Sears Holdings, whose Kenmore brand sources its larger washers from LG’s overseas factories. </P><P>The tariffs are expected to slow a shift to renewable energy in the United States, just as solar was becoming cost competitive with electricity generated from fossil fuels like coal, an industry that Trump has pledged to protect. </P><P>MJ Shiao, head of renewable energy research for Wood Mackenzie, said the tariffs would likely reduce projected US solar installations by 10-15% over the next five years. </P><P>“It is a significant impact, but certainly not destructive to the end market,” Shiao said. </P><P>The domestic solar panel producers who sought the trade remedies wanted tariffs of 50% – the highest allowed under law. Petitioners Suniva and SolarWorld have said they cannot compete with the influx of cheap imports, mostly from Chinese producers, which has caused solar panel prices to drop more than 30% since early 2016. </P><P>The US solar trade group, the Solar <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Energy</A> Industries Association, campaigned against the tariffs and estimated the decision would create a “crisis” for the burgeoning industry and result in the loss of 23,000 US jobs this year as billions of dollars in solar investments are cancelled.</P><P>Suniva, majority-owned by Hong Kong-listed Shunfeng International Clean Energy Ltd, applauded the decision, saying that Trump “is sending a message that American <mark>innovation</mark> and manufacturing will not be bullied out of existence without a fight.” </P><P>The decisions were the first of several potential tariff actions that Trump may take in the coming weeks and months. He is considering recommendations on import restrictions for steel and aluminium on national security grounds under a 1962 trade law and tariffs or other trade sanctions against China over its intellectual property practices. </P><P>The intellectual property, washer and solar panel probes were done under a 1974 trade law that has been seldom invoked since the World Trade Organization was launched in 1995.</P><DIV class=""submeta""><SPAN class=""submeta__label"">Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

</DIV><DIV class=""pf-content""><P><STRONG>LONDON, NEW YORK, ZURICH, SEPTEMBER 7, 2017: </STRONG>S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices (S&amp;P DJI), one of the world’s leading index providers, and RobecoSAM, an investment specialist focused exclusively on Sustainability Investing (SI), today announced the results of the annual Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) review.</P><P>The three largest additions and deletions (by free-float market capitalization) to the DJSI World this year include:</P><P><STRONG>Additions: </STRONG><mark>Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.</mark>, British American Tobacco p.l.c., ASML Holding N.V.</P><P><STRONG>Deletions: </STRONG>Enbridge Inc.1, Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, Rio Tinto plc 2</P><P>1 Still member of DJSI North America</P><P>2 Still member of DJSI Europe</P><P>The new component lists for the DJSI will be published on the RobecoSAM website on <SPAN data-term=""goog_933064009"">Monday, September 11, 2017</SPAN>. All changes are effective on <SPAN data-term=""goog_933064010"">Monday, September 18, 2017</SPAN>.</P><P>Launched in 1999, the DJSI World represents the gold standard for corporate sustainability and is the first global index to track the leading sustainability-driven companies based on RobecoSAM’s analysis of financially material Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors and S&amp;P DJI’s robust index methodology. Every year, RobecoSAM assesses the world’s largest companies via its Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA), which uses a consistent, rules-based methodology to convert an average of 600 data points per company into one overall score. This score determines inclusion in the DJSI.</P><P><STRONG>Manjit Jus, Head of Sustainability Application &amp; Operations, RobecoSAM: </STRONG>“Being a pioneer and thought leader in Sustainability Investing for over 20 years, we understand the right questions to ask in our CSA in terms of financially material sustainability aspects within the corporate world. This is what firms appreciate about the CSA. It brings them a big step ahead in terms of Corporate Sustainability and with this – a big step ahead of their competitors – getting a coveted spot in the DJSI makes sure they continue to play in the premier league of companies.”</P><P><STRONG>David Blitzer, Managing Director and Chairman of the Index Committee, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices: “</STRONG>Many of the events witnessed so far in 2017 make it even more important for corporations around the globe to recognize sustainability, establish policies and manage their businesses in ways that support and increase sustainability of the global environment and the world’s leading businesses. The DJSI family provide a tool for investors to create asset allocations that can further sustainability.”</P><P><STRONG>Ahead of the Curve </STRONG></P><P>RobecoSAM prides itself on the development of leading ESG assessment criteria to achieve deeper insights into companies’ sustainability practices. Tax Strategy and Materiality criteria were, for example, added to the CSA in 2014 and 2016, respectively, anticipating investors’ growing interest in them. <STRONG>PRESS RELEASE </STRONG>Page <STRONG>2 </STRONG>of <STRONG>4 </STRONG></P><P>This year, RobecoSAM’s CSA assessed Policy Influence for the first time to learn more about companies’ lobbying activities, and expanded the Impact Measurement &amp; Valuation criteria to nearly all industries. Preliminary analysis of the CSA data set for these criteria reveals:</P><P><STRONG>Companies spend on policy influence</STRONG></P><P>RobecoSAM perceives Policy Influence as a material issue for investors that deserves more attention from ESG and investment analysts. In situations where the revenues of public companies are larger than the GDPs of the countries in which they operate these companies may exert tremendous influence over the local political and legislative process. This creates risks and opportunities which are critical inputs into investment decisions.</P><P>Analysis of the CSA dataset reveals that companies in the DJSI assessment universe spend an average of 0.02% of total sales annually on policy influence activities (median spending is 0.01% of total sales). Another observation is that companies are hesitant to report on Policy Influence spend that goes beyond legal obligation.</P><P><STRONG>Companies face difficulty assessing financial impacts</STRONG></P><P>In light of the <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals (SDGs) as set by the United Nations Development Programme in 2016, companies, governments and investors alike want to understand both the positive and negative externalities inherent in companies’ business models and how their products, services and operations contribute to, or detract from, the achievement of the SDGs.</P><P>Analysis of the CSA data set shows that while the vast majority (70%) of companies are aware of the need to understand these types of environmental and social profits and losses, less than 10% of companies actually have a viable valuation approach in place today that provides detailed insights into these potential financial impacts.  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Its emissions doubled in the 15 years to 2005, the fastest growth in the OECD.  </P><P>South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, laid out several measures to help it achieve the goal, adding that trade in <mark>carbon</mark> emissions rights and tax incentives could help offset some of the costs. It did not provide any further details on these plans.  </P><P>It also aims to increase use of hybrid cars, renewable and nuclear energy consumption, energy efficiency with light-emitting diodes and smart grids to achieve the target, which will cost 0.3 to 0.5 percent of GDP.  </P><P>While modest compared to the 15-17 percent curbs that Japan and the United States have pledged, officials said they marked a big commitment to head off an estimated 30 percent rise in emissions that would result if no action were taken.  </P><P>Seoul drew measured praise for taking a lead among newly industrialized nations not bound by the U.N.’s Kyoto Protocol by setting 2020 goals ahead of a major global <mark>climate</mark> meeting in Copenhagen, where the U.N. hopes to seal agreement for a successor pact to Kyoto from 2013.  </P><P>“It’s good to see countries like South Korea willing to take a step forward but of course we would like to see a higher level of ambition,” said Diane McFadzien, <mark>climate policy</mark> officer for conservation group WWF in Singapore.  </P><P>“If you look at the group of developing countries in general, having some come forward and take steps is useful, it stops them from hiding more as a bloc, saying it’s not possible.”</P><H3>GREEN INVESTMENT  </H3><P>The country’s green investment plans already rank near the top in Asia. The government said last month it would invest 107 trillion won ($87.56 billion), or 2 percent of its annual GDP, in environment-related industries over the next five years, pushing stricter fuel efficiency and emission requirements.  </P><P>But as one of Asia’s richest nations, it has come under pressure to cut its output of planet-warming <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, which reached 11.1 metric tons per person in 2005, the same as some European nations and the 17th largest among OECD members.  </P><P>For a graphic, please click: <A href=""http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/089/KR_C02EM0809.jpg"">here</A></P><P>“Probably many would say ‘great, South Korea is taking steps now’. But in terms of really big impact, in terms of the Copenhagen process, it is probably not significant enough to impact other countries’ commitments,” said Changhua Wu, Greater China Director for The <mark>Climate</mark> Group, an NGO.  </P><P>Under the Kyoto Protocol, nearly 40 developed nations are legally bound to curb greenhouse gas emissions between 2008-2012. Those countries are under intense pressure from developing countries to ramp up their targets to cut emissions more deeply by 2020 as part of a broader <mark>climate</mark> pact under negotiation.  </P><P>South Korea, along with other newly industrialized states such as Singapore and Mexico, are unlikely to immediately join the list of nations legally bound to curb emissions, making any measures voluntary. Mexico in June said it would voluntarily cut emissions by an estimated 8 percent by 2012.  </P><H3>FEAR OF “<mark>CLIMATE</mark> TARIFFS”</H3><P>As the world’s sixth-largest crude buyer and second-largest LNG buyer, South Korea wants to reduce its dependence on <mark>carbon</mark> energy resources and embrace green energy, messages that stoke anxiety among many of its resource-intensive industries.  </P><P>“To the petrochemical industries, it means new additional costs,” said an official at top ethylene maker Yeochun Naphtha Cracking Center.  </P><P>The Korea Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry said in a statement: “It is hard to evaluate the target options without specific details, although they look desirable, considering the Korean economy keeps growing.”</P><P>Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Hyundai Motor Group, which owns Hyundai Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp, POSCO and SK Energy have all announced billion dollars in green-related investment plans.  </P><P>But the government on Tuesday pointed to the future risk of border tariffs on South Korean exports. In a statement, the government said the European Union and other developed countries might punish some exporting nations that do not adopt tough greenhouse gas reduction targets.  </P><P>South Korea, as the world’s fifth-largest automaker, is heavily dependent on exports of manufactured goods and petroleum products to drive its economy.  </P><DIV class=""container_28wm1""><DIV class=""attribution_o4ojT""><P class=""content_27_rw"">Additional reporting by David Fogarty; Editing by Jonathan Leff</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

<mark>Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.</mark> unveiled the world’s first “Wind-Free” wall mounted air-conditioner designed after careful consideration of the <mark>climate</mark> in the Saudi Arabia. This all-new air-conditioner has integrated Samsung’s exclusive wind-free cooling technology into the product’s design, providing customers with a perfect indoor <mark>climate</mark> with optimal energy efficiency and without direct cold airflow.Ismail Yoon, president of Samsung Electronics KSA, said: “Consumers will love this new air condition and the capabilities it comes with as it cools their living and working spaces. They will no longer have to deal with uncomfortable, cold air, and high electricity bills.”The “Wind-Free” air-conditioner provides customers with ideal conditions by maintaining a comfortable room temperature, using the latest technology to gently disperse cold air through 21,000 micro air holes. Saher Hilal, head of air-conditioning at Samsung Electronics KSA, said: “A two-step cooling system first lowers temperature, using the fast cooling mode before switching automatically to ‘Wind-Free Cooling Mode’ creating ‘still air’ once the desired temperature is reached.” This approach can also reduce energy consumption by up to 72 percent compared to “Fast Cooling Mode.”Using Samsung’s 8-pole new digital inverter with power-boost technology, the compressor’s motor generates fewer torque fluctuations — reducing the overall energy required and shortening the time needed for the compressor to reach its maximum rotation speed.The Wind-Free™ Air-conditioner is also Wi-Fi-enabled so it can be controlled from anywhere through Samsung’s Smart Home app. Users can remotely regulate temperature, adjust settings, receive real time updates about performance and daily energy usage, as well as troubleshoot solutions when a repair is needed. The unique “triangle architecture” has a wider inlet which allows more air to be drawn in at once, while the optimal width and angle of the outlet, extra v-blades, and large fan — 22 percent larger than previous — ensure air is cooled and expelled faster, farther and wider, to reach every corner of the room.Samsung also unveiled the world’s first “Wind-Free” One-Way, and Four-Way Cassette air-conditioners, using the same technology into its design, offering the commercial construction market and business partners reliable air solutions. </DIV></DIV><DIV class=""entry-comments""><DIV class=""section-wrapper""><DIV class=""section-title text-center first-letter-style uppercase""><H4><SPAN><BUTTON type=""button"" class=""comments-load button hollow gray uppercase comments-holder-opened"" onclick=""loadDisqus($(this), 'Samsung’s world’s first ‘Wind-Free’ air-conditioner launched in KSA', '/node/1230636'); return false;""><SPAN>Hide comments</SPAN></BUTTON></SPAN></H4></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""view view-full-content-display view-id-full_content_display view-display-id-block_1 view-dom-id-6e061f0c57706461d628d88d5a7ae828""><DIV class=""view-content""><DIV class=""views-row views-row-1 views-row-odd views-row-first views-row-last""><DIV class=""pageWrapper""><DIV class=""entry-article"" data-nid=""1305976""><DIV class=""grid-x entry-article-inner align-center""><DIV class=""cell large-auto""><DIV class=""printable-area""><DIV class=""title-area show-for-printable-area""><H2>Events company sees KSA as market leader</H2></DIV><DIV class=""entry-highlight""><UL><LI>My Events International is based in Malaysia and operates on three continents worldwide.</LI><LI>‘Saudi Arabia is being renewed,’ says My Events International founder. </LI></UL></DIV><DIV class=""entry-meta hide-for-large no-print""><DIV class=""updated-ago"">
