This is especially true of those in historically poor and disadvantaged Scheduled Tribe (ST) and Scheduled Caste (SC) communities. Although the entire population of women farmers in India face gender-based inequalities, women belonging to these communities are particularly marginalized, experiencing multiple layers of discrimination. The prevalence of Scheduled Tribe and Scheduled Caste communities is particularly high in the state of Odisha, located in the eastern region of the India. Poverty levels in the state are also high with a significant percent of its population living below the poverty line. The primary source of employment in the state has historically been agriculture and this continues to be the case. However, over the years, the sector has suffered from minimal investment, declining growth, and frequent natural disasters.</P><P>The Pathways program seeks to increase poor women’s productivity and empowerment in more equitable agriculture systems at scale using a strong gender focus, working with ST and SC communities in two rural districts of Kalahandi and Kandhamal of Odisha State in India. To address agricultural input access disparities, the program tested an <mark>innovation</mark> that brings affordable inputs closer to farmers—agricultural kiosks. With supplementary funding from Cargill, Inc., Pathways is working to close the input supply gap, using agricultural kiosks as <mark>sustainable</mark> providers of inputs and market information to assist farmers. Kiosks are placed in close proximity to Pathways villages and within access to well-paved roads, eliminating the burden of farmers traveling 25+ kilometers to blocks where they previously went to purchase inputs. This case study assesses the impact of agricultural kiosks on access to inputs among women farmers in India.</P><H2><SPAN style=""color: #e4761e;""><STRONG>Results</STRONG></SPAN></H2><P>The study found that women’s access to agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizers grew significantly over the project period, increasing 2.4 fold, from 37% to 89% at the end of the project. Survey data shows women at the baseline primarily sourced inputs from local producers, cooperatives and government programs, in the range of 12-14% of female farmer respondents for each of these groups. While sourcing from cooperatives and governments has decreased since baseline, inputs from local producers doubled to 26%. Similarly, there was a 23% increase in access to inputs from suppliers five or more kilometers away and a 40% increase in access to nearby suppliers such as agricultural kiosks, eliminating the burden of farmers traveling 25+ kilometers to blocks where previously they had to go to for inputs. At least half of the kiosk customers are women who are interested in paddy and kitchen garden inputs.</P></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

An urgent solution is needed for <A href=""http://www.cargill.com/foodsecureworld/"" target=""_blank"">how we will feed 9.5 billion</A> people by 2050 in a changing <mark>climate</mark> that is altering how we grow our food.</P><P>This promises to be a daunting exercise. Global warming could have the most serious impact on the parts of the world where populations are growing the fastest. Most of the planet’s remaining arable land is in Africa, a continent that is rich in growth and promise, but, for now, still poor in income and infrastructure.</P><P>One can’t help but wonder how we’ll come up with enough food for all.</P><P>These worries are not new. The world’s population grew from 1.5 billion in 1900 to 2.5 billion in 1950. Then, too, many feared that agricultural output couldn’t keep up. As late as the 1960s, people warned of a ticking “population bomb.” Yet, the “Green Revolution” in agriculture delivered new techniques and scientific approaches to growing food. In the last 40 years, we were able to double agricultural output without taking much new land into production.</P><P>We at Cargill believe the world can do that again. But it won’t just happen by itself. Just as we did in the second half of the 20th century, we have to keep innovating and using science and technology to get the most out of every acre. We have to build the infrastructure in the developing world to make that happen.</P><P>The complicating factor, compared to the 20th century, is <mark>climate change</mark>. We don’t know the full consequences global warming will have, but we do know that we are beginning to see them today. One in 100- and 1,000-year heat waves, droughts and floods are becoming routine. The planet is seeing months and years of record heat. According to NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2014 was the hottest year on record, and 2015 is on pace to be even hotter.</P><P>Evidently, we all need to do what we can to keep <mark>climate change</mark> in check. Cargill has been lowering its own greenhouse gas emissions steadily, and we’re taking measures to eliminate deforestation – a significant source of greenhouse gases – from our supply chains. But we also need to prepare ourselves for a more volatile world.</P><P>The solution is not to cut and run, with individual nations moving to protect their own populations with trade barriers and short-term advantage winning the day. We need to recognize our interdependence. If each country grows the crops it grows best and imports the ones it doesn’t, the total amount of available food will grow. If extreme weather wipes out harvests on one end of the globe, we need a global trade system that allows food to flow there freely from the other end.</P><P>That is by no means an easy task. In December, another U.N. <mark>Climate</mark> Summit will be held in Paris. We hope for the best, but we also know that past summits have shown how hard it is to rise above politics as usual and cooperate for substantial progress.</P><P>That’s why Cargill and its partners – the World Wildlife Fund, the Center for American Progress, the Center for Naval Analyses and Mars, Inc. – are organizing the <A href=""http://foodchainreaction.org/"" target=""_blank"">Food Chain Reaction</A> crisis simulation in Washington on November 9 and 10. We want to put real-life decision makers in the eye of the storm to see how they handle disruptions to the global food system and react to the consequences of their own decisions. We are optimistic that the world can rise to the challenge. The point now is to learn how to do it.</P><P><EM>Joe Stone is a corporate vice president of Cargill and a member of the company’s Sustainability Council.</EM></P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In India to inaugurate a $100-million corn milling unit of his firm in Karnataka, MacLennan told ET that 2016 will be a good year for consumers as the downturn in commodities is likely to continue. Edited excerpts from an interview:</EM><STRONG>You are here to inaugurate Cargill’s corn milling facility in Karnataka. What are your future plans for India?</STRONG> I was here last in March 2014… In less than two years we have a new corn mill. We have 550 employees at our shared services business in Bengaluru from zero two years ago. We project to have another 500 employees in next 12-15 months. Cargill has embarked on a worldwide business services approach. So we have five shared services centres in the world with Bengaluru being one of them. I get to India every other year. So I was here 22 months ago and will be here again soon. <STRONG>What do you think has changed in the past 22 months?</STRONG> We have certainly changed. We have a new corn mill and 500 employees. Soon we will have a new animal feed mill in Punjab. So our business profile is changing. Siraj (Cargill India chairman Siraj A Chaudhry) and his colleagues have been able to grow our edible oil business based in Gurgaon. I think the business <mark>climate</mark> seems to be friendlier, people are more optimistic since (Narendra) Modi came in power. The feedback that I have got since I have been here is that the ease of doing business is becoming less cumbersome. <STRONG>What are your plans for India in term of investment?</STRONG> We are going to build 60,000 tonnes of storage near our corn mill in Karnataka. So that's a $10-million investment. So I think between the three investments (corn mill unit, animal feed business in Punjab and storage) we have put a lot of money in the country. Next we want to see the business grow to the potential and give returns on our investment. Right now in near term we don’t have plans for additional capital, but better the things go with our investment the more willing we will be to continue to invest. <STRONG>Chinese <A href=""/topic/economy"" target=""_blank"">economy</A> just saw its slowest growth in 25 years. How long do you see the down cycle of commodities globally?</STRONG> At least another year I think (for the down cycle to continue). China has significant stocks of corn. We can keep speculating that what will happen when it starts releasing the stock in the market. I think we have seen record growing seasons in North and South America in the last couple of years. There is no pressure on prices relative to petroleum prices. So I think it is very good for consumers. Low prices are here to stay for at least the next year, but of course that can always change in case of a significant weather event. It’s been a very moderate winter for <A href=""/topic/North-America"" target=""_blank"">North America</A> and from where I am, things can change very quickly. But I think for the foreseeable future, next one year, it looks that the down cycle in commodities will continue. There is plenty of stock (wheat, corn, soyabean) available globally. <STRONG>CEOs of developed world talk about BRICS economy. What is your view on investing in emerging markets?</STRONG> Emerging markets are down. We have invested significantly in emerging markets, but I don’t think it’s time to panic. If you are in the US things are good and if in Europe it is not bad. We have to be patient and have conviction that this is the place you want to be for the long term. So no one in Cargill is saying that we want to run away from BRICS. We are a 151-yearold company and we have gone through so many cycles in business history and this is another one. We look at where is opportunity, where we can be successful, where can we grow, rather than this is better than that place, and we should invest. <STRONG>Are you watching <mark>climate change</mark>?</STRONG> We have been very active in trying to be a thought leader about <mark>climate change</mark> and its impact. Look at the severity in temperatures in growing seasons, moisture levels, etc. The swings will become more extremes and significant in the years ahead as a result of <mark>climate change</mark>. We are looking at the scenario and what it means for our corn, wheat and soya. Where will be they grown, what <mark>climate</mark> will be hostile and which will be friendly? We are spending considerable time on the impact of it on food economy. <STRONG>Do you think genetically modified crops could be the solution?</STRONG> That’s a very timely question. GM crops are a solution to and tool to sustainability to help meditate the impact of <mark>climate change</mark>. In the US the debate is on GM and it is not only of labelling but there is a misconception that GM food is harmful. It’s a controversial topic in most countries, particularly in the US. <STRONG>So do you think India should adopt it?</STRONG> I think the Indian population is well informed and educated about the benefits of GM crop relatively to sustainability and responsible agriculture practices. <STRONG>How do you see your domestic business in edible oil, grains and animal feed?</STRONG> It’s doing well. It is our core business — the edible oils. But I don’t think we will be investing as much capital as we did earlier. You can imagine there are some countries in the world where we are not investing any new capital and where things are very volatile, but that is not the case in India. So we have been putting substantial money in the past couple of years in India. <STRONG>India is very uncompetitive in global commodity market compared to Brazil and Argentina. What are the reasons?</STRONG> Argentina and Brazil have been consistently investing in agriculture infrastructure at a faster pace than India. Those countries are consistently investing in agriculture infrastructure from ports to river ways — ways to get products to market and onto the world market. That is a challenge for India. Currency competitiveness is also another reason, but the Brazilian real is also very weak. <STRONG>What are your thoughts on Iran?</STRONG> It’s step by step. I think it remains to be seen to what trade moderation with Iran takes place, now that sanctions have been lifted. I think it will be a while before you see open trade relations. It’s my opinion. I think it might take another 3-5 years for something to last. What happens in politics in the US, who gets elected also has to be watched. <STRONG>Globally, after making investment in salmon feed business in Norway, chicken facility units in China and new cocoa chocolate unit in Indonesia, what is your focus?</STRONG> We have invested in green field projects significantly in Asia, but I am interested in acquisitions. The challenge is that acquisitions are very expensive as interest rates are low and multiples are very high, so we have to be patient. Our focus will be aqua feed. In agriculture, supply acquisitions are expensive, but we are scouting for acquisition for industrial oil supply. Animal protein and nutrition accounts to 40% of our business, followed by agriculture and food ingredients. We sold our port business last year so we are looking at opportunities in poultry sector. </DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""clearfix sharingBox shareVert bottom"" data-share_msid=""50735672""><DIV class=""flt comment_count"" onclick=""commentBox.show(50735672);"" data-msid=""50735672""><SPAN>0</SPAN>Comments

						Cultured meat company Memphis Meats has received a sizable donation from a number of investors, including Bill Gates and Richard Branson. Going forward, the company will use the money to improve the food quality, reduce costs, and potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions.					</DIV><DIV class=""summary module""><H2>I Can’t Believe It’s Not Beef</H2><P><A href=""https://futurism.com/lab-grown-meat-startup-may-add-thanksgiving-turkey-to-the-menu/"" target=""_blank"">Memphis Meats</A>, a post-livestock meat producer, received a new $17 million donation from a slew of major American industrial powerhouses, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, and <A href=""https://www.cargill.com/about"" target=""_blank""><mark>Cargill Inc</mark></A>, one of the largest agricultural corporations in the world. As of August 23, Memphis Meat has raised a total surpassing $22 million.</P><P>Some consumers prefer to know their meat comes from a familiar source, but lab grown meat may be the inevitable future of food. This isn’t a small-time one-off or fad. Another company called <A href=""https://futurism.com/are-lab-grown-meats-really-the-future-of-food/"" target=""_blank"">Beyond Meat</A> is also proving the concept’s worth by creating great-tasting food without live animals, which require a lot of resources to properly house and raise.</P><P><A href=""https://futurism.com/researchers-unveiled-the-first-chicken-meat-grown-without-chickens/"" target=""_blank"">Memphis Meats already produces chicken</A>, beef, and duck from animal cells, forgoing the need to use live animals, and intends to use their new funding to add to the range of food it produces. It also plans to improve upon various aspects of its business, including faster food production and reduced production costs.</P><H2>More Lab Chicken, Less Gas Emission</H2><P>“The world loves to eat meat, and it is core to many of our cultures and traditions,” said Memphis Meats co-founder and CEO Uma Valeti <A href=""http://www.memphismeats.com/s/Memphis-Meats-Press-Release-23-Aug-2017-vFF-nefe.pdf"" target=""_blank"">in a press release</A>. “Meat demand is growing rapidly around the world. We want the world to keep eating what it loves. However, the way conventional meat is produced today creates challenges for the environment, animal welfare and human health.”<FIGURE style=""width: 360px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text center""><STRONG><A href=""https://futurism.com/images/highrises-and-labs-may-be-the-farms-of-the-future/"" target=""_blank"">Click to View Full Infographic</A></STRONG></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></P><P>A <mark>climate change</mark> report published by the WorldWatch Institute earlier this year claimed animal agriculture accounts for <A href=""https://futurism.com/researchers-unveiled-the-first-chicken-meat-grown-without-chickens/"" target=""_blank"">nearly 51 percent of gas emissions</A>. Meat production alone uses about a third of our planet’s fresh water and land. The new livestock-free process uses fewer resources to grow meats, which would certainly reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we pump into our besieged atmosphere. The thing to take away here is this: <mark>climate change</mark> continues to be huge issue, and shifting to lab-grown meat would go a long way in addressing this serious antagonism.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Led by experts in global food production, security, political science and <mark>climate change</mark>, participants assumed the roles of governments, institutions and businesses as they confronted a burgeoning crisis from 2020 to 2030.</P><P><A href=""http://foodchainreaction.org/"">Food Chain Reaction</A> exposed three critical gaps in the global food system. To create a more resilient and food-secure future, organizers recommend several policy priorities to narrow these gaps:</P><UL><LI><STRONG>The Knowledge Gap:</STRONG> Public- and private-sector leaders should build on successful early warning systems to develop a real-time global food security dashboard that allows decision-makers to detect and address disruptions to the global food system before they occur.</LI><LI><STRONG>The Productivity Gap:</STRONG> Public, private and multilateral actors must invest to increase agricultural productivity in low-income countries in a <mark>sustainable</mark> manner, while minimizing its impact on the environment.</LI><LI><STRONG>The Collaboration Gap:</STRONG> Global leaders need to create specialized forums to enable better decision-making in times of crisis, introduce long-term measures, and engage cross-sector decision-makers on global food security issues.</LI></UL><P>“This exercise shed light on areas in which collaboration can catalyze cooperation to help head off food shortages before they occur,” said exercise mentor Senator Tom Daschle, CAP Chairman and Founder and CEO of The Daschle Group. “<mark>Climate change</mark> will certainly stress our global food system, but we are now better armed with a deeper understanding of how decision-makers may act as shortages escalate into crises.”</P><P>“In the beginning stages of the simulation, leaders were apprehensive to act and collaborate. But, as inaction led to increased volatility and instability, they worked together to find solutions,” said <A href=""../../experts/dave-mclaughlin"">David McLaughlin, senior vice president for <mark>sustainable</mark> food at WWF</A>. “They found that no one nation, organization or business could successfully address global food security, yet the actions of any one entity could create negative impacts globally.”</P><P>“Food Chain Reaction demonstrated that the global food system can withstand the pressures of <mark>climate</mark> and political instability,” said Joe Stone, vice president for animal nutrition at Cargill. “But a new approach focused on breaking down barriers and public-private action is required.”</P><P>“Governments, civil society and businesses are grappling with how to work together to provide safe, affordable and nutritious food for a growing population threatened by <mark>climate change</mark>,” said Dave Crean, vice president for corporate research and development at Mars, Incorporated. “Food Chain Reaction gives us all clear evidence that collaboration and innovative public-private partnerships are essential to building a more secure food system for the future.”</P><P>A full set of findings, recommendations and participants are available at <A href=""http://foodchainreaction.org/"">www.foodchainreaction.org</A>.</P><P># # #</P><P><STRONG>About Food Chain Reaction</STRONG></P><P><A href=""http://foodchainreaction.org/"">Food Chain Reaction</A> was held in Washington, D.C.

Today, we have a unique opportunity to build the food system of the future and nourish the world in safe, responsible, and <mark>sustainable</mark> way.</P><P class=""p2"">To achieve this, companies like Cargill will need top talent, and that includes Hispanic and Latino professionals who bring great insights and experience. The best way to be ready for a fast-changing global food landscape is to have people who can comfortably and flexibly operate across borders, languages, and cultures.</P><P class=""p2"">At Cargill, we employ more than 1,300 food scientists who are working on the next generation of food and ingredients at our <mark>innovation</mark> centers worldwide. We have teams building the advanced data systems we’ll need to nourish a growing population. We are also empowering experts in strategy, accounting, marketing and business operations to build a globally integrated company that delivers <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chains.</P><P class=""p2"">Here’s the challenge we are working together to tackle: The planet’s population is rising and will reach 9 billion by 2050, and according to the World Wildlife Fund, we are using more resources than the Earth can supply today. That means we’ll have to grow and move significantly more food while protecting the planet in the face of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P class=""p2"">The good news is this: We know we can do it. We have access to the knowledge and technology to adapt and build the future of food. All we need now is the people to make it happen.</P><P class=""p2"">As a company that operates in seventy countries and employs 150,000 people, we know that diversity is crucial. The data is clear: diverse teams consistently deliver better results. To build new food systems, we will need all the energy and creativity a diverse workforce brings.</P><P class=""p2"">Hispanics and Latinos are a growing demographic in the United States in terms of size, education, and potential. The Census Bureau projects that Hispanics will account for 65 percent of US population growth in the next forty-five years! According to the Pew Research Center, college enrollment among Hispanics in 2014 was at 35 percent for the 18-24 age group, up from 22 percent in 1993. These numbers become even more meaningful when you take into account that nearly half of US-born Latinos are under 18.</P><P class=""p2"">That’s why we are actively reaching out. It’s why we are proud of the professional development work our Cargill Hispanic and Latino Council is doing inside and outside the company. It’s also why we have consistently argued for an effective and inclusive legal immigration policy.</P><P class=""p2"">Cargill is no stranger to Latin America. We opened our first Latin American subsidiary in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1948. Today, we have thriving businesses in thirteen countries around the region, and based on my frequent travel there, I know the region is full of possibility.</P><P class=""p2""><SPAN class=""s1"">On my last trip to Latin America, I visited three countries that offer enormous potential in food and agriculture: Brazil, Chile, and Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, I visited San Pedro Apostol School in Managua where our employees support a school nutrition program and work to advance the next generation of leaders. Our teams in Latin America are not only building high-performing businesses, but also passionate about giving back to local communities.</SPAN></P><P class=""p2"">Finally, food tastes and preferences are changing. As the Hispanic population in the US grows, Latin American food in all its rich variety is steadily gaining in popularity, not the least because more and more non-Hispanics are getting a taste for it. As a food and nutrition company, we like this trend, but we need more people to bring the Latin American menu to life in the products and ingredients we make.<SPAN class=""Apple-converted-space"">       </SPAN></P><P class=""p2"">Think about Cargill when you consider your next career decision. More than a third of our US-based employees are Hispanic, and we employ tens of thousands of native Spanish and Portuguese speakers in the rest of the world. We offer exciting career paths that few other employers can match. We have engaged many outstanding Hispanic women and men to lead our businesses.</P><P class=""p2"">Who knows, you could be the one writing this letter in the future.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV class=""related-posts""><H2>You Might Also Like</H2></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

Its annual energy bill as a result is projected to drop $938,000.</P><P>Other success stories can be found on the <A href=""http://www.energy.gov/eere/amo/business-case-sep#case-studies"">DOE</A> website.</P><P>Since publication of the ISO 50001 standard in 2011, more than 15,000 facilities worldwide are realizing average energy-performance improvements of 10 percent or more, according to the <A href=""http://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/north-american-governments-announce-pilot-program-accelerate-regional-adoption-energy"">U.S. Energy Department</A>. Success through 50001 is not a onetime deal. The standard emphasizes continual improvement in energy performance companies that comply must commit to achieving greater energy savings every year.</P><P>Business leaders understand. Smarter energy use is good not only for our health and the environment.</P><P>It's also good for business. </P></SPAN><DIV class=""author-teaser""><H2 class=""center-title"">About the Authors</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It aims to provide what it calls the first-ever &quot;comprehensive assessment of the economic risks our nation faces from the changing <mark>climate</mark>.&quot;</P><P>There will be lost productivity, the report says, because of extreme heat. More power plants will need to be built to provide electricity for air conditioners. Sea-level rise, meanwhile, threatens infrastructure, particularly along the Eastern Seaboard and Gulf Coast.</P><P>&quot;If we stay on our current <mark>climate</mark> path, some homes and commercial properties with 30-year mortgages in places in Virginia, North Carolina, New Jersey, Alabama, Florida, and Louisiana and elsewhere could quite literally be underwater before the note is paid off,&quot; the report says.</P><P>There is a 1-in-20 chance, it says, &quot;that by the end of this century, more than $701 billion worth of existing coastal property will be below mean sea levels, with more than $730 billion of additional property at risk during high tide.&quot;</P><P>The <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/assets/2014/06/24/document_cw_01.pdf"" target=""_blank"">56-page document</A>, which targets a business audience, will be formally unveiled this morning in New York City and posted online at riskybusiness.org. <EM><mark>Climate</mark>Wire</EM> obtained an advanced copy of the report.</P><P>Steyer, Paulson and Bloomberg are scheduled to attend the New York event, in addition to several members of the Risky Business advisory committee: Clinton administration Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, as well as Alfred Sommer of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Gregory Page, former CEO and current chairman of the board of <mark>Cargill Inc</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>Short- and long-term impacts</STRONG>
The American economy is already beginning to feel the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, the report says, and &quot;these impacts will likely grow materially over the next 5 to 25 years and affect the future performance of today's business and investment decisions.&quot;</P><P>Rising seas, increased damage from storm surge and more frequent bouts of extreme heat will have &quot;specific, measurable impacts on our nation's current assets and ongoing economic activity,&quot; it says.</P><P>The analysis focuses on three major areas where there are risks as a result of &quot;human-induced <mark>climate change</mark>&quot;: coastal property and infrastructure, agriculture, and energy.</P><P>There are likely to be more extreme storms, it says, such as 2012's Superstorm Sandy.</P><P>&quot;Within the next 15 years, higher sea levels combined with storm surge will likely increase the average annual cost of coastal storms along the Eastern Seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico by $2 billion to $3.5 billion,&quot; the report says. Combined with potential changes in hurricane activity, &quot;the likely increase in average annual losses grows to up to $7.3 billion, bringing the total annual price tag for hurricanes and other coastal storms to $35 billion.&quot;</P><P>Temperature increases over the next five to 25 years are likely to bring about a demand for more power, an amount equal to the generation of roughly 200 average coal or natural gas-fired power plants, the report says. That will cost residential and commercial ratepayers up to $12 billion per year.</P><P>Over the longer term, there will be many more days with uncomfortable and dangerous temperatures, it said. That extreme heat—especially in the Southwest, Southeast and Upper Midwest—threatens &quot;labor productivity, human health, and energy systems,&quot; it says.</P><P>&quot;By the middle of this century, the average American will likely see 27 to 50 days over 95°F each year—two to more than three times the average annual number of 95°F days we've seen over the past 30 years,&quot; the report says. &quot;By the end of this century, this number will likely reach 45 to 96 days over 95°F each year on average.&quot;</P><P>Higher temperatures will bring serious challenges to the farming industry, it says, particularly in certain regions.</P><P>Without adaptation, some Midwestern and Southern counties could see yield declines of more than 10 percent over the next five to 25 years if they continue to sow corn, wheat, soy and cotton, the report says. There is a 1-in-20 chance of yield losses of those crops of more than 20 percent, it says. The analysis does not put a dollar value on those potential losses, because it would be impossible to project future prices, said Matt Lewis, director of communications for Risky Business.</P><P>Risky Business based its findings on data from the National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment and Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) reports, as well as peer-reviewed literature on extreme weather impacts on crops, labor productivity and energy system performance. It also uses proprietary models on coastal storm surge impact from Risk Management Solutions (RMS), which models catastrophes for the insurance industry and financial institutions.</P><P><STRONG>'Explicitly avoiding' policy prescriptions</STRONG>
The Risky Businesses analysis has been eagerly anticipated by some environmental groups, businesses and Democratic activists because of the high-powered team behind the document. In addition, Steyer has been active politically, using his personal wealth to back candidates he believes support his goals on <mark>climate</mark> and to target others with opposing views.</P><P>The &quot;Risky Business&quot; document, however, does not advocate any actions to address <mark>climate change</mark>. Lewis emphasized that Steyer is just one of 10 people involved, after counting the seven-member Risk Committee.</P><P>&quot;We're not building a list of businesses who are on board for policy. That's not the objective of 'Risky Business,'&quot; Lewis said. &quot;We're explicitly avoiding a discussion of policy in the entire project.&quot;</P><P>Members of the group's Risk Committee don't agree on the best policy to address warming, he said.</P><P>&quot;What they completely agree upon is that <mark>climate change</mark> poses many risks across many sectors of the American economy, and that we should not in good conscience leave those risks unaddressed,&quot; Lewis said.</P><P>The primary goal of the analysis is to help businesses understand those risks, he added. That could help companies make informed decisions.</P><P>&quot;You could change the way capital flows work to real estate, if they start to realize there's properties they're investing in now that could be uninsurable in 20 years,&quot; Lewis said. There could be different investments in the agricultural field &quot;to deal with the changing growth patterns that we expect,&quot; he said.</P><P>Businesses could be involved in shaping government action, Lewis said, but they will have to decide on their own if that's in their best interest.</P><P>&quot;The American business community has a critical role to play both in preparing itself for <mark>climate change</mark> and in informing the policy response,&quot; Lewis said.</P><P><STRONG>Some foresee pushes for regulations</STRONG>
Critics of the Risky Business project, however, said they were concerned it would be used to advocate for expensive fixes.</P><P>The report is likely to &quot;raise alarm bells,&quot; said Chris Neefus, spokesman for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group linked to energy barons Charles and David Koch.</P><P>&quot;Generally, we find that on the heels of something like this, that folks are looking to raise taxes,&quot; either directly through a <mark>carbon</mark> tax or by rule changes that raise power prices, Neefus said.</P><P>Tom Pyle, president of American Energy Alliance, a nonprofit focused on free-market advocacy and partly funded by energy companies, said that restrictions on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions would be costly and not extremely effective.</P><P>Cutting greenhouse gas <mark>pollution</mark> to zero by 2100 would result in a temperature drop of 0.17 degree Celsius, he said, adding that he was citing information from reports prepared for the IPCC analysis.</P><P>&quot;Squandering the huge amount of resources to do any more than the marketplace is already doing doesn't make a lot of sense to me,&quot; Pyle said.</P><P>Lewis said that one of the key findings of the &quot;Risky Business&quot; report is that increases in temperatures will vary by regions. The average global temperature drop or avoided temperature increase that Pyle is citing is not very useful, Lewis said.</P><P>&quot;While it's easy to sort of point to averages,&quot; Lewis said, &quot;for places like Alaska or like the Southeast that are going to see extreme changes, it doesn't help.&quot;</P><P>Averages mask variability and don't give the true impact, he said. There is the same problem with averages on sea-level rise and flooding, he said.</P><P>&quot;On average, the United States is not going underwater,&quot; Lewis said, &quot;but don't tell that to the people of Miami.&quot;</P><P>One Democratic strategist said he hopes facts in the report will be used for political advocacy with TV ads and other outreach to voters before the election.</P><P>&quot;It potentially can be a piece to the puzzle of turning around the basic framework on this issue,&quot; said Mark Longabaugh, a partner at Democratic media consulting firm Devine Mulvey Longabaugh. &quot;It helps the public accept the idea that <mark>climate change</mark> is going to drastically affect our economy.&quot;</P><P>Oil and coal interests have promoted the idea that cutting <mark>carbon</mark> emissions is costly, he said, while the long-term damage from warming &quot;is far greater.&quot;</P><P>&quot;Once that turns, I think people opposing serious <mark>climate change</mark> legislation are going to be in a really tough spot,&quot; Longabaugh said.</P><P>Lewis, asked about whether Steyer plans any activism on <mark>climate</mark> using the report, referred questions to Steyer's political advocacy arm, NextGen <mark>Climate</mark>. A spokeswoman there did not immediately respond to an inquiry.</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>wire with permission from Environment &amp; Energy Publishing, LLC. <A href=""https://www.eenews.net"" target=""_blank"">www.eenews.net</A>, 202-628-6500</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

May 10th, 2017</P><P><STRONG>Mr. President:</STRONG></P><P>We are writing to express our strong support for the United States remaining in the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement.</P><P>As CEOs of large American companies, or with significant operations in the United States, we are concerned about keeping the doors open for the global flow of American manufactured goods and products at this critical time when our Manufacturing sector is starting to grow from our competitive energy advantage.
Based on our vast experience doing business all over the world, we believe there is strong potential for negative trade implications if the United States exits from the Paris Agreement.</P><P>Our business interests are best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced response to reducing global GHG emissions. The Paris Agreement gives us that flexible framework to manage <mark>climate change</mark> while providing a smooth transition for business. We believe that American companies…and our suppliers, customers, and communities… will benefit from U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement in several ways:</P><UL><LI>It strengthens our competitiveness in global markets.</LI><LI>It benefits American manufacturing as we modernize to new, more efficient technologies.</LI><LI>It supports investment by setting clear goals which enable long-term planning.</LI><LI>It expands global and domestic markets for clean, energy-efficient technologies which will generate jobs and economic growth.</LI><LI>It encourages market-based solutions and <mark>innovation</mark> to achieve emissions reductions at low cost.</LI></UL><P>We are committed to working with you to create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness, and we believe this can be best achieved by remaining in the Paris Agreement. Let’s work together to maintain the United States’ status as the world’s biggest champion of economic growth and <mark>innovation</mark>.</P><P>We appreciate the opportunity to share our views and would welcome the opportunity to provide further input as the Administration continues to shape its policies.</P><P>Sincerely,</P><P>

Several meat companies including Tyson and JBS were identified among the worst performers. A recent report from Environment America ranked Tyson as the <A href=""http://environmentamerica.org/sites/environment/files/reports/CorpAgFoulingWaterways2016-web.pdf?_ga=1.187127656.1792305949.1478873928"">biggest water polluter</A> in the meat sector, releasing 104 million pounds of toxic pollutants into waterways from 2010 to 2014 from its slaughtering and processing plants, and buying livestock that generates approximately 55 million tons of manure per year. During the same time period, it is estimated that collectively Smithfield (27.3 million lbs.), Cargill (50.4 million lbs.), JBS (37.6 million lbs.) and Perdue (31 million lbs.) directly released 146.3 million pounds of toxic pollutants into U.S. waterways.</P><P>Fines for violations of wastewater permits have proven costly to the industry.

(12)</P><P>But internationally, the company is unlikely to face repercussions: one of its former executives practically wrote the rule book for the global food trade. Daniel Amstutz, President of Cargill Investor Services from 1972 to 1978, was the US chief negotiator for agriculture in the Uruguay round of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations.</P><P>The GATT Uruguay round is widely regarded as representing the most substantial liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products and paved the way for the creation of the World Trade Organization. It also brought agriculture into the global patent regime. Amstutz returned to agribusiness as a consultant soon after, but the revolving door continued to turn...</P><P> </P><H3>The Corporate Colonisation of Iraq </H3><P>Amstutz popped up again as a diplomat in post-invasion Iraq in 2003, placed in charge of the ‘reconstruction’ of Iraqi agriculture, much to the outrage of the international community. Oxfam’s policy director Kevin Watson said: “Putting Dan Amstutz in charge of agricultural reconstruction in Iraq is like putting Saddam Hussein in the chair of a human rights commission... This guy is uniquely well-placed to advance the commercial interests of American grain companies and bust open the Iraqi market – but singularly ill-equipped to lead a reconstruction effort in a developing country”. (13)</P><P>Cargill cashed in on the post-invasion US administration’s abolition of taxes and tariffs on imported products, fooding the market with hundreds of thousands of tonnes of wheat. According to journalist Greg Palast, “For Iraqi farmers, already wounded by sanctions and war, this was devastating. They could not compete with the US and Australian surplusses dumped on them”. (14)</P><P> </P><H3>The Food Aid Industry:</H3><P><STRONG>Greed feeding Hunger</STRONG></P><P>Food aid is big business. In the USA, it has accounted for 15% of rice exports and 12% of wheat exports over the last two decades.15 Cargill has been a big benefciary: since the 1950s it has become the main contractor of US food aid funded under Public Law 480. (16)</P><P>It has been estimated that seven out of ten countries receiving this aid went on to become seven of the ten best customers for US grain.17 The US aid programme has allowed Cargill to get rid of surpluses of GM crops rejected by Europe. This has created a dangerous situation of dependency for peasant farmers worldwide.</P><P>Writing in 2000, when Ethiopia was on the brink of a famine in which eight million people faced starvation, Michel Chossudovsky described how the policies of international fnancial institutions and US biotech corporations, including Cargill, had sowed the seeds of famine in the frst place.  A key element of this was the contamination of indigenous seeds and landraces with genetically engineered food aid. (18)</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Deforestation and biofuels </STRONG></P><P>Wherever there is an agricultural commodity with notorious issues associated with it – such as cocoa and cotton, with endemic problems of child labour in their supply chains – it seems you find Cargill. Perhaps it is no surprise, then, that Cargill is a key player in the global palm oil trade. It owns plantations, exports the product and also, through various companies, imports and trades it in the USA.</P><P>It is the USA’s biggest palm oil importer. (19)  In 2003 the company claimed that it exported 11% of Indonesian crude palm oil. (20) Palm oil production in Indonesia and elsewhere has had a devastating effect on local communities and environments, while the associated deforestation and the destruction of peatland is a major contributor to <mark>climate change</mark>. In 2007 Greenpeace reported that Indonesia had become the world’s third largest greenhouse gas emitter, behind only the USA and China. (21)</P><P>Cargill vehemently denied claims made by the Rainforest Action Network in May 2010 about alleged illegal clearing of Indonesian rainforest, stating they were “categorically untrue”. (22)</P><P>The campaign group stood its ground, responding: “We stand by the evidence released in our report that Cargill’s plantations in Indonesia are cutting down rainforests, violating the Roundtable on <mark>Sustainable</mark> Palm Oil (RSPO), and are out of compliance with Indonesian law.” (23)</P><P>In Brazil, the company is implicated in deforestation associated with its soy operations. Greenpeace claims that two years after the company announced plans to build two grain silos, a $20m terminal and its own port in the heart of the Amazon, satellite images showed that deforestation rates had doubled in the region. (24)</P><H3> </H3><H3>
Take action </H3><P>Friends of the Earth are calling on supporters to tell supermarkets that they don’t want to eat products from animals fed a GM diet, see <A href=""http://www.foe.co.uk/get_involved/natural_resources.html "">www.foe.co.uk/get_involved/natural_resources.html </A>and go to ‘Ask Supermarkets to stay GM free’.</P><H3> </H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

Last year, McDonald’s began <A href=""http://corporate.mcdonalds.com/mcd/sustainability/signature_programs/beef-sustainability/<mark>sustainable</mark>-beef-starts-at-the-farm.html"">piloting</A> the standards with nearly 150 operations in its Canadian beef supply chain.</P><P>Those pilots are ongoing. Just last month, Cargill, one of McDonald’s go-to beef suppliers, <A href=""http://www.feedstuffs.com/news/cargill-pioneers-canadian-beef-traceability-pilot-project"">announced</A> that its Canadian Beef Sustainability Acceleration pilot, by the end of 2018, will provide customers with beef &quot;from operations that have been audited from 'birth to burger' using an industry-developed sustainability standard.&quot; The yearlong project will explore a variety of tracking technologies, such as DNA testing and blockchain, to design a process for producing verified <mark>sustainable</mark> beef &quot;that is robust while still being practical, scalable and cost-effective,&quot; according to a Cargill press release.</P><P>For two years, McDonald’s has been surveying suppliers such as Cargill for best practices in <mark>sustainable</mark> cattle raising and beef production. Among the things it wanted to know: &quot;What kind of projects are out there? Where do we need to engage?&quot; Townsend Bailey, director, U.S. Supply Chain Sustainability at McDonald’s, told me recently.</P><P>&quot;As we started asking these questions and looking at innovative companies, topics around grazing, and particularly regenerative grazing, kept coming up in one form or another,&quot; he said. Bailey and his colleagues met with various groups working on regenerative grazing practices. That led them to Byck, who was invited to present his project.</P><P>&quot;Townsend was very focused on scale,&quot; recalled Byck. &quot;He was like, ‘OK, let's say your science proves that grazing alone can regenerate the land and regenerate the farmer's pocketbook. How do you get to scale?’&quot;</P><DIV class=""media media-element-container media-gbz_inline_full_width""><DIV class=""image-caption""><P>McDonald's Townsend Bailey, in conversation at the GreenBiz 17 conference in Phoenix, Arizona.</P></DIV></DIV><P>Byck is quick to point out, &quot;I’m a filmmaker, not a farmer,&quot; but he knew enough about educating and motivating people to act on <mark>climate change</mark> that he had some ideas. &quot;It's about incentivizing people to change, not trying to make anyone change, because that's the last thing a farmer will do.&quot;</P><P>A lot was at stake. The world's soils hold a significant amount of <mark>carbon</mark> — more than double the amount in the atmosphere. For years, a small number of farmers have used techniques such as conservation tillage, cover cropping and crop rotation to reduce soil loss and keep <mark>carbon</mark> in the soil, which can improve soil health and fertility and make land more productive.</P><P>AMP is another tool in that toolkit. It involves moving cattle around grazing land for short durations in small, fenced-off areas called paddocks. Then giving paddocks long periods of time to rest, which catalyzes accelerated grass regrowth along with other flora and fauna. The method mimics the migrations of wild herd animals, such as elk, bison and deer, as they move from place to place. </P><H3>Buried treasure</H3><P>AMP’s potential is as critical to farming as it is to the <mark>climate</mark>. &quot;Soil is a living and life-giving natural resource,&quot; <A href=""https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/soils/health/"">said</A> the United States Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service. &quot;As world population and food production demands rise, keeping our soil healthy and productive is of paramount importance. So much so that we believe improving the health of our nation’s soil is one of the most important conservation endeavors of our time.&quot;</P><P>To the extent that America’s agricultural soil is a national treasure — and a buried treasure at that — industrial ag has been squandering it for decades. Today, the quality and quantity of soil in the United States represents, by some measures, a looming national catastrophe.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>To the extent that America’s agricultural soil is a national treasure — and a buried treasure at that — industrial ag has been squandering it for decades. </P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><A href=""http://resilience.earth.lsa.umich.edu/units/landuse/index.html"">According to</A> the University of Michigan’s Global Change Program, 96 percent of North America’s soil erosion comes from food production (66 percent from agricultural activities; 30 percent from overgrazing). The majority occurs in America’s heartland, where we produce much of our food. In significant portions of the Midwest, up to 75 percent of the topsoil has been lost, mostly due to modern farming techniques.<P>This is no small thing. A single gram of soil may hold a billion bacteria, which are able to perform an extremely wide range of chemical transformations, including breaking down organic matter and manufacturing nutrients inside roots. These processes are crucial to growing a healthy food supply.</P><P>Restoring soil health provides a number of essential biological functions. It regulates water, helping control where rain, snowmelt and irrigation water goes. It filters, buffers, degrades and detoxifies pollutants, including industrial and municipal runoff. It ensures the diversity and productivity of plants and critters that live in soil. It stores <mark>carbon</mark>, nitrogen, phosphorous and other nutrients. It anchors the roots of plants and trees.</P><P>And you can’t just make more topsoil. Generating three centimeters of topsoil takes 1,000 years, and if current rates of degradation continue, all of the world's topsoil could be gone within 60 years, a senior United Nations official <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/"">told a global food forum</A> in 2014.</P><H3>Ground beef from the ground up</H3><P>Byck’s project will focus on two U.S. cattle-ranching regions: the Southeast and the upper Great Plains. His team includes 17 scientists from six agricultural universities and both for-profit and nonprofit research groups. Together, they’ll collect and study a variety of data.</P><P>&quot;We're looking at how the ecosystem functions,&quot; Byck explained. &quot;Can grazing alone be beneficial for the whole ecosystem of the farm?&quot; He said the project will be looking at a wide range of issues — &quot;from soil health, to greenhouse gas cycling, to the bugs and the birds, to animal well-being and farmer well-being. And we’ll compare apples to apples — folks who are doing AMP grazing with their neighbors.&quot;</P><P>Meanwhile, there’s the nontrivial goal of matching the McDonald's funding quickly in order be out in the field in the Southeast in 2018 and in the upper Great Plains in 2019. With $4.5 million in, there’s another $13 million or so to go.</P><P>The anecdotal evidence is compelling. &quot;I've been to about 30 different farms and ranches over the last few years filming, and it's just consistent,&quot; said Byck. &quot;The farmers will tell me they were in debt before they started focusing on soil health and started using these methods, and now they're not in debt.</P><P>&quot;They're seeing plants growing on their lands that people haven't seen in that county for 50 to 100 years, and they didn't plant them. They were able to weather droughts much better than their neighbors. They're seeing perennial streams that their grandfather had told them about, but which had been dry for their whole life. Just story after story, and consistent in dry areas, mountainous areas, wet areas, flat areas. We're seeing that farmers and ranchers are doubling, tripling and quadrupling their carrying capacity. That means producing two, three and four times as much meat on the same acreage with the same rainfall as prior.&quot;</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>They're seeing plants growing on their lands that people haven't seen in that county for 50 to 100 years, and they didn't plant them. </P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></SECTION>I asked Townsend Bailey how McDonald’s plans to participate in the research. &quot;At the end of the day, we are just the funders,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to make sure that the science is able to move forward and really broaden the understanding of grazing practices and the potential for positive ecosystem impacts. Our hope is that this project can be a great way to quantify the positive impacts of ranching and of beef production, and also provide light on best practices that could be implemented on the ground to bring about those positive impacts.&quot;<P>It’s not just an academic exercise, said Bailey. &quot;We think it could be hugely significant. Depending on the outcomes of the science, this could become a real focal point for us in the types of trainings and peer-to-peer learning that we invest in.&quot;</P><P>And, said Bailey, if McDonald’s has a good story to tell along the way, all the better.</P><P>&quot;The grazing conversation and the potential benefits of grazing for land, for rural communities, for cattle, for greenhouse gas emissions and <mark>carbon</mark> — I think it really connects with people because it's about the positive things we can do. It’s definitely something that we're looking at from a long-term perspective. It's something McDonald's could really get behind.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""field field-name-field-greenbiz-topics-ref field-type-entityreference field-label-inline clearfix""><DIV class=""field-label"">Topics: </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

		  </DIV><DIV class=""abstract"" style=""width:auto;"">CFTC fines Cargill, Inc $10 million for allegedly hiding true markup on swaps dealsThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission ordered Cargill, Inc. of Minnesota, a registered swaps dealer, on Monday to pay a $10 million penalty for allegedly providing counterparties and its swap data repository inaccurate marks from 2013 to the present that effectively concealed up to 90% of Cargill's mark-up. The CFTC order contends Cargill concealed its full mark-up because providing accurate marks might reduce Cargill's revenue. The CFTC also alleged that Cargill failed to diligently supervise its officers, employees, and agents relating to its business as a swap dealer. The regulator filed and simultaneously settled charges on Monday alleging Cargill had violated the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations but Cargill neither admitted nor denied the allegations.

Musing on the “terrible news” that the concentration of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere recently passed 400 parts per million, a level that augurs further rapid <mark>climate change</mark>, Thompson concluded that humans will ultimately have to “invent our way out” of the crisis.</P></DIV><DIV class=""tablet-ad""><SPAN class=""adv""> Advertisement </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""text text-6 parbase section""><P>Given humanity’s proven ability to master new technologies, such faith is not unreasonable. Over the last two centuries, we have harnessed electricity and nuclear power, revolutionized the speed at which we travel, entirely rethought how we share and manipulate information, and learned to engineer the basic materials of life.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-7 section""><P>The question we should be asking, however, is not whether we have the technical smarts to ensure we all have enough to eat. It’s whether we have the political smarts to protect those among us—the scientists and engineers and entrepreneurs—who will think up the better ideas and better ways and put them to use.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-8 section""><P>The fundamental danger we face is simple. In recent years a few private companies have captured almost complete control over many vital technological realms, and the managers of many of these firms increasingly have an incentive to manipulate technological advancement in a way that serves their private interests only. As a result we find our society directed down fewer and fewer technological pathways, hence toward fewer and fewer potential futures.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-9 section""><P>In the late 19<SUP>th</SUP> century, when Americans first came face to face with immense private monopoly, it was easy to see how giants could block alternative pathways to a market. When independent oil drillers in Pennsylvania tried to build a pipeline to the coast, for instance, Standard Oil bought up long strips of land—often called “dead lines”—to cut them off.</P></DIV><DIV class=""tablet-ad""><SPAN class=""adv""> Advertisement </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-10 section""><P>Nowadays most such battles take place in more virtual realms. In the pharmaceutical industry, <A href=""http://www.uspirg.org/sites/pirg/files/reports/Top_Twenty_Pay_For_Delay_Drugs_USPIRG.pdf"">GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer</A> routinely pay rivals not to manufacture generic versions of profitable drugs. In semiconductors, trustbusters in Europe, Japan, and South Korea all concluded in recent years that Intel was using secret arrangements to prevent its customers from buying from competitors. In software, the fashion today is simply to buy up one’s rivals; <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/22/technology/22oracle.html?_r=0"">Oracle</A> has purchased more than <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Oracle"">70</A> competitors just since 2005.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text-11 text parbase section""><P>Nowhere do we see so many “dead lines” cutting across our future than in agriculture and food.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text-12 text parbase section""><P>By now most of us know the chemical company Monsanto dominates immense swaths of the seed business, with its genetic traits in some 90 percent of our soybean crop and 80 percent of our corn. Less well-known is that <A href=""http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/monsanto-reaches-another-cross-licensing-pact-with-a-rival/article_ec7b071a-797a-54ed-8114-5170b138edce.html"">Monsanto</A> buttresses this awesome control through cross-licensing arrangements that, as a Food &amp; Water Watch <A href=""http://documents.foodandwaterwatch.org/doc/Antitrust-Seeds-web.pdf"">report</A> details, intimately interweave its interests with its “rivals,” as it did with DuPont last March. The practical result? Where many thousands of farmers, small seed companies, and university scientists once worked to develop stronger seeds, we see but a handful of giants. And because these firms now share the profits of most <mark>innovation</mark>s, they have less real incentive on any given day to risk investing in what is new.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text-13 text parbase section""><P>Much the same is true among the giant corporations that butcher and package our cows, hogs, and chickens. In the past <A href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/food/2013/06/shuanghui_s_smithfield_takeover_what_the_planned_buyout_means_for_american.html"">Smithfield</A> and other giant processors merely enjoyed power over the farmer and consumer. Now they also rule over the genetic material of the animals themselves, which they claim is a form of “intellectual property,” as they noted in <A href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/10/senate-smithfield-ceo-defends-merger/2505699/"">congressional hearings</A> earlier this month. Their power is so complete that the companies that trade in animals bred through traditional, open methods—like <A href=""http://www.gourmet.com/foodpolitics/2009/01/politics-of-the-plate-niman-ranch-crisis"">Niman Ranch</A>—find it ever harder to survive.</P></DIV><DIV class=""tablet-ad""><SPAN class=""adv""> Advertisement </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""text text-14 parbase section""><P>The swelling power of the trading companies that collect the grains of the farmer and distribute food to the citizen further speed such technological pruning and intellectual simplification. When giant grain-trading companies buy up traditional transport and storage facilities, as ADM is now doing with <A href=""http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/companies/heffernan-keeps-digging-but-graincorp-chief-stands-her-ground-on-adm-offer/story-fn91v9q3-1226680408077"">GrainCorp</A>, higher transport and storage fees can threaten smaller farmers, along with their accumulated knowledge of seed, soils, and <mark>climate</mark>s. When Wal-Mart cuts what it pays its suppliers, those suppliers often respond, as Charles Fishman detailed in <EM><A href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143038788/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143038788&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=slatmaga-20"">The Wal-Mart Effect</A></EM>, by cutting quality, variety, and what they invest in new and better products. They also often respond by merging with one another, which means both fewer pathways to the market and less competitive pressure to introduce and test new ideas.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text text-15 parbase section""><P>The effects of such gigantism on technological advance can last a long time. The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1942 famously wrote of how the fear of “potential competition” can keep even a complete monopolist on its toes. But in the real world, such “potential” is realized only rarely. Instead, we see processes and products that remain the same over very long periods of time, as the companies that control these systems choose to invest instead in buying up and blocking off what is new, even if better.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-16 section""><P>In the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century, both Democrats and Republicans routinely used antitrust law to drive competition in some of our most important technological realms—including electronics and communications. The result was a series of fantastic technological advances. Yet the trustbusters did not always succeed. In 1911 they lost a case against U.S. Steel. Seventy-five years later, that company still relied on the same old furnaces even as foreign companies in more competitive markets developed vastly superior technologies. In 1926 the trustbusters failed to force GE to open up the light bulb market. As a result, we continued to use notoriously wasteful 19<SUP>th</SUP>-century tungsten filament technology well into the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-17 section""><P>Before we can ever effectively address concentration and its effects on technological advance—and the chance to create a better, perhaps <mark>sustainable</mark> world—we must first overcome the widespread misapprehension that competition is wasteful, hence that in regulating our political economy we must aim foremost at efficiency.</P></DIV><DIV class=""tablet-ad""><SPAN class=""adv""> Advertisement </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-18 section""><P>The idea is not a new. In America we can trace the idea to men like John. D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan, who justified their predations in large part by claiming they were making business more “efficient.” Such thinking was soon adopted—and formalized—by many economists and other “experts.” A century ago in America, many promoters of “scientific management” of production truly believed there was a “one best way” to accomplish every task.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-19 section""><P>But the idea did not win wide acceptance. Classic liberals like Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Dwight Eisenhower believed strongly in the need to promote competition through the distribution of power—for both political and economic reasons. One practical result was very <A href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/july_august_2013/features/estates_of_mind045639.php?page=all"">rapid technological advance</A> in those sectors where antitrust was enforced. For instance, the great industrial historian Alfred Chandler concluded that it was the trustbusters who “set the stage” for the Silicon Valley scientists who invented the “electronic century.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase section text-20""><P>In the 1960s, however, the idea of efficiency surged back into fashion on both wings of the political spectrum, especially among followers of leftist economist John Kenneth Galbraith and the right-wing “Chicago school” of economics. The argument was essentially the same one put forward by Rockefeller a century earlier: The bigger a firm, the greater its ability to drive down prices and serve the “consumer.” But this time, with the backing of the “consumer movement” forged in the 1960s, the advocates of efficiency at last achieved the revolutionary change they sought. The key to their political victories? The argument that enforcement of antitrust law should be oriented around a new concept—that of “consumer welfare.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-21 section""><P>In the three decades since the “consumer welfare” test was built into our anti-monopoly laws, Americans have witnessed perhaps the greatest roll-up of power ever, one that has remade almost every sector of the U.S. economy. And the basic thinking remains largely unchanged, even after the Wall Street crash of 2008 revealed some of the structural dangers posed by concentration and even after the Tea Party and Occupy movements proved that Americans still very much fear monopoly. The idea that government should help private actors to impose “efficiency” in business and banking—supposedly to help the “consumer”—still shapes decision-making by the Obama administration, Congress, and the Federal Reserve.</P></DIV><DIV class=""tablet-ad""><SPAN class=""adv""> Advertisement </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""text-22 text parbase section""><P>Strangely, one of the strongest bastions of support for this “consumer welfare” argument is the environmental movement. Here the origins of the idea that competition is “wasteful” trace largely to Theodore Roosevelt-era thinking on “conservation.” But the practical result is the same, as we can see when groups like the Environmental Defense Fund and Natural Resources Defense Council embrace Wal-Mart and other goliaths precisely because they believe they can “create environmental progress by leveraging corporate purchasing power.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""text text-23 parbase section""><P>In 1798 the British economist Thomas Malthus published “An Essay on the Principle of Population.” His argument was simple. The limited amount of land in the world meant a limited amount of food, hence a limit to the total number of people. If the population grew beyond this limit, starvation would soon bring the numbers back into balance. For decades, right through human catastrophes like the Irish Potato Famine, the rulers of Europe used Malthus’ zero-sum argument as an excuse to do nothing.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text-24 text parbase section""><P>Yet across the Atlantic, the American people were already proving Malthus wrong. Having broken the power of the lords and clerics who for so long ruled over our land and industry and minds, Americans now took advantage of our new freedom to think up better ways to reap and sow and improve our seeds. And so, long before gasoline-powered tractors, petroleum-based fertilizers, and genetic manipulation of plant matter, American farmers adapted plants like wheat and corn to entirely new ranges and greatly increased per-acre yields.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text-25 text parbase section""><P>We stand today, as a society, armed with innumerable better ideas. They include, as Michael Pollan <A href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/07/michael_pollan_on_agriculture_s_role_in_fighting_<mark>climate</mark>_change.html"">told <STRONG><EM>Slate</EM></STRONG>recently</A>, farming techniques that empower us simultaneously to address “<mark>climate change</mark> <EM>and</EM> soil quality <EM>and</EM> food security.” This includes, as <A href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/07/open_source_gmos_to_fight_<mark>climate</mark>_change_and_take_down_monsanto.html"">Frederick Kaufman wrote</A>, “open source” approaches to improving foods that empower many scientists to participate in projects where one or a few corporate teams now rule. It is impossible, today, to know which ideas will best enable us to adapt our food system to a world of rapid, even chaotic environmental change. What we do know is the best way to sort through these ideas is within transparent and competitive marketplaces.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-26 section""><P>The American food movement has achieved much success in developing new models of farming, and in creating markets and regional networks that connect growers to eaters. But the movement can never win the big fight—to apply these principles to the systems that feed all the people of the world—until it stands up squarely to the command-and-control corporate systems that increasingly dominate our political economy, and to the arguments used to justify that power.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-27 section""><P>If we find ourselves living in a new era of food shortages, it will not be due only to our failure to control <mark>carbon</mark>. It will be due even more to our failure to protect the open-market systems that empower us not merely to exchange, but to think and adapt.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

They were part of what transpired at <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://foodchainreaction.org/"" target=""_hplink"">Food Chain Reaction</A> a few weeks ago, a high-level crisis simulation in Washington, DC that brought together 65 international leaders to explore how <mark>climate change</mark> may strain the world's food system from 2020 to 2030.</P><P>What the simulation taught us, is that policymakers attending this week's<A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/paris-cop21/"" target=""_hplink""> U.N. <mark>climate</mark> summit in Paris</A> cannot afford to neglect food security. The world's population is on a path to 9.5 billion by mid-century.

It is time to decide on a course of action that will actually improve the situation.</P><P>Will <mark>climate change</mark> by itself break the global food system in the next 10 to 15 years? That's unlikely. Prices right now are low and relatively stable. The system has enough resilience to absorb shocks.

The protesters who poured into the streets of Arab capitals not only demanded political reform, but also the proverbial 'bread'. </P><P>The current violence in Syria was preceded by a severe drought and widespread crop failures in that country, exacerbated by failed agricultural policies. Hundreds of thousands of impoverished farmers fled to the cities. Mass protests led to civil war and the chaos we see today, most notably with a continued refugee crisis and the savagery of ISIS, that has now reached the streets of Paris and was felt in San Bernardino, California.</P><P>To be sure, food and <mark>climate</mark> were far from the only causes here. But many smart observers have pointed out that they had an impact and added to an already volatile mix. It would be unwise to ignore these analyses. </P><P><A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://foodchainreaction.org/index.php/2015/10/27/what-is-food-security/"" target=""_hplink"">Food security</A> - ensuring enough safe, affordable and nutritious food for all - is often under-appreciated in <mark>climate</mark> discussions. It shouldn't be. What we've already seen in recent years should serve as a warning. Increased volatility is the new normal. It's not a matter of whether some hotspots will erupt, but when. It's up to all of us to be ready to respond. Having enough food for regions vulnerable to <mark>climate</mark>-induced calamities is job number one.</P><P><A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://foodchainreaction.org/index.php/2015/11/11/they-came-they-played-they-offered-an-insight-into-our-food-future/"" target=""_hplink"">As the Food Chain Reaction exercise showed</A>, there are constructive ways forward. The players, an international cast of former cabinet secretaries, parliamentarians, high-level officials from national governments and international institutions, academics, business executives and think tank types, came up with a host of cooperative solutions. Among them: building cross-border information hubs and early warning systems, multilateral water management schemes, initiatives to curb food waste, technology exchanges and - most eye-catching - a global <mark>carbon</mark> tax. </P><P>All of these ideas merit discussion. Some may work, some may not. But what's most important is that the simulation highlighted the prospects for cooperation. Faced with mounting environmental challenges and international tensions, <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://foodchainreaction.org/index.php/2015/11/13/food-chain-reaction-insights-in-our-players-words/"" target=""_hplink"">the players chose long-term thinking</A> and multilateralism over closed borders and the short-term national advantage.</P><P>Secluded inside a Washington conference center, far from the searing eye of the media and armed with high-minded intentions, that is, of course, a lot easier than in the real world, where the game is often perceived as zero-sum and national electorates stand ready to punish leniency. But it also shows what can be achieved if actors come together, determined to solve big problems. </P><P>That's why organizations like <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.cargill.com/corporate-responsibility/food-security/"" target=""_hplink"">Cargill</A>, a multinational agricultural business, and <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/investing-in-a-food-secure-future"" target=""_hplink"">WWF</A>, a global conservation organization, are joining hands to delve into these defining issues. In different times we would have been seen as strange bedfellows, but the stakes are high and the clock is ticking. The longer we go without action, the deeper the problem will get and the more disruptive the measures we'll ultimately need to take. We can meet the challenges ahead, but we must get started now, so we can avoid frantic steps at the eleventh hour.</P><P><SPAN style=""font-style:italic;"">This post is part of a &quot;<mark>Climate</mark> Justice&quot; series produced by The Huffington Post, in conjunction with the U.N.'s 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris (Nov. 30-Dec. 11), aka the <mark>climate</mark>-change conference.

However, Cargill is both a major importer of palm oil into the U.S., and has a two-part business model in the palm oil industry: it both owns and operates palm oil plantations in Indonesia and it purchases and trades palm oil and its derivatives worldwide. Cargill’s palm oil problem stretches far beyond its own plantations.</P><P>While it is true that progress can, and should, be made to reduce the impacts of its own plantations, the real human and environmental costs of Cargill’s palm oil business is in the actions of its suppliers in plantations where oil palm fruit is planted and grown. More spin than substance, Cargill fails to come clean about the real and ongoing impacts of its supply chain in its new video. Overly focusing on its own plantations, Cargill admits the true nature of its palm oil supply chain almost as an aside, briefly stating in its report, “we source primarily from third-party suppliers.”</P><P style=""text-align: left;"">Cargill first committed to eliminate palm oil suppliers associated with deforestation, degradation of <mark>carbon</mark>-rich peatlands and human and worker rights’ violations in September 2014. Since then, little progress has been made to drive real change on the ground in Indonesia, Malaysia and Latin America, where a majority of the palm oil Cargill buys and sells is produced. Take for example, the following cases where serious environmental and social impacts remain: <STRONG>Problem: Land grabbing and Human Rights Abuse</STRONG></P><P>The practice of land grabbing occurs when palm oil companies seize community land for the further development of plantations. Over the past years, <A href=""http://www.ran.org/palm_oil_giant_kuala_lumpur_kepong_berhad_klk_plagued_by_ongoing_conflict_and_exploitation_new_progress_report_finds"" target=""_blank"">Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad (KLK)</A>, a known supplier to Cargill, has attempted to pursue development in Collingwood Bay, Papua New Guinea, and Grand Bassa County, Liberia, despite active opposition and lack of Free, Prior and Informed Consent from local communities.</P><P>Grupo Olmeca, and its subsidiary <A href=""http://www.ran.org/alarming_developments_in_latin_american_palm_oil_industry_spur_global_call_to_action_for_palm_oil_traders"" target=""_blank"">REPSA</A>, is a major palm oil company in Guatemala that according to local communities has committed egregious violations of human rights, including the alleged murder of human rights defender Rigoberto Lima Choc, who opposed its operations due to direct impacts on local communities and workers.</P><P>Cargill has failed to take meaningful and transparent actions to remedy the human rights violations of these suppliers, but has instead kept KLK and Grupo Olmeca in the supply chain with little transparency and no accountability.</P><P><STRONG>Problem: Exploitation of Workers</STRONG></P><P>In a recent <A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/palm-oil-migrant-workers-tell-of-abuses-on-malaysian-plantations-1437933321"" target=""_blank"">Wall Street Journal report</A>, forced labor and human trafficking were exposed in the operations of palm oil giant Felda Global Ventures (FGV)––a known supplier to Cargill in Malaysia where a number of Cargill’s palm oil refineries are located. Rather than admit that problems exist and develop a plan to address them, FGV has denied the accusations, accused the reporter of lying, and attempted cosmetic efforts to ride out the media storm without making any fundamental changes to its labor practices. An inadequate audit commissioned by the Roundtable on <mark>Sustainable</mark> Palm Oil (RSPO) detailed several indicators for forced labor but then failed to actually investigate two of the most critical indicators: the method of recruitment and legal work status of subcontracted workers.</P><P>Cargill has so far failed to commission a skilled labor assessor to independently and transparently verify FGV’s compliance with its policy. Even on its own plantations, Cargill’s efforts toward upholding workers’ rights are weak. In 2015, Cargill undertook a ‘labor pilot’ on its own plantation in West Kalimantan but the findings have not been published.</P><P><STRONG>Problem: Deforestation Of Endangered Species Habitat and <mark>Carbon</mark> Rich Peatlands</STRONG></P><P>Cargill has failed to enforced a moratorium on forest and peatland clearance in the operations of its suppliers and new acquisitions, such as the <A href=""http://www.greenomics.org/docs/IPOP_Implementation_Report-05_Greenomics.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Polipant Group</A>. Palm oil expansion continues to drive deforestation in the 6.5 million acre global biodiversity hotspot known as <A href=""http://www.ran.org/lastplaceonearth"" target=""_blank"">The Leuser Ecosystem</A>. Located in Aceh on the island of Sumatra, it is the last place on Earth where Sumatran orangutan, tiger, elephant, rhino and sunbear coexist in the wild, and the companies responsible for the destruction of rainforests and peatlands in the area sell palm oil to Cargill’s key global suppliers.</P><P>Sadly, a devastating annual forest fire season has become the norm in Indonesia, as fires intentionally set to cheaply clear land for new plantations rage out of control. Cargill has posted maps of the fires in its own concessions as a way to appear like it is taking action to address its contribution to the fires which burn across Indonesia and blanket the skies of local villages and cities, as well as those cities across Southeast Asia, with toxic smoke each year. The fires are huge drivers of <mark>climate change</mark>, disrupt air traffic, provoke public health emergencies and trigger diplomatic crisis among Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Cargill will not be able to guarantee that it is not sourcing palm oil from plantations where fires are ablaze until it requires all its suppliers to publish all concession maps and enforce a moratorium on the clearance of forests and peatlands across their entire operations.</P><P>What’s more, Cargill’s efforts to halt deforestation have taken a step backward as it supports and plans to trial the <A href=""http://www.ran.org/ran_statement_on_the_final_high_<mark>carbon</mark>_stock_science_study"" target=""_blank"">High <mark>Carbon</mark> Stock (HCS+) Study</A>. The so-called “High <mark>Carbon</mark> Stock+” model will allow further clearance of forests and peatlands and includes a dangerous loophole that allows companies to offset ongoing deforestation in palm oil concession areas through setting aside forests in other landholdings. Its proposal to use ‘offsets’ and a ‘<mark>carbon</mark> neutral approach’ in the implementation of “No Deforestation” commitments has been criticized by many NGOs. If implemented, Cargill will continue to drive further destruction of important forests and the expansion of the flawed, industrial concession palm oil plantation model, aggressively developed in Indonesia and Malaysia into other frontier regions.</P><P><STRONG>Problem: Lack of Transparency and Accountability</STRONG></P><P>While Cargill has begun issuing regular progress reports in an effort to update its customers and critics these reports lack the details needed to demonstrate whether or not real progress is being made on the forest frontlines of palm oil expansion and in existing plantations growing the palm oil Cargill currently sells.</P><P>Cargill has not yet made public the names and locations of all of its suppliers in its global supply chain; its non-compliance protocols or the names of suppliers it has dropped; or data on the proportion of its suppliers that have been verified by an independent third-party as compliant with its policy. Cargill has established a grievance procedure, but has failed to ensure that it meets international norms for truly independent grievance mechanisms and the company currently fails to recognize and demand the resolution of outstanding social conflicts in its supply chain.</P><P>These cases demonstrate that more action is needed before Cargill can claim to be “responsible.” Cargill must stop misrepresenting the progress it has actually made, come clean on the ongoing impacts of its global palm oil supply chain and start taking real action to address the serious social and environmental consequences of its palm oil business.</P><P>Cargill’s business lines touch all aspects of palm oil production, trade, refining and marketing as it moves palm oil from producers to end consumers. The palm oil giant has a crucial role to play in building traceable and responsible palm oil sourcing from growers to markets. With your help, Rainforest Action Network will demand real action, not just lip service, and continue to hold Cargill to account for the impacts of its global demand for commodities, including palm oil.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Far less attention has been paid to the agri-food sector, despite as much as 29% of <A href=""http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-environ-020411-130608"" rel=""nofollow"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">global emissions being associated</A> with food production.</P><P>At present food companies only report their direct emissions, which include their own energy use but often exclude the vast majority of indirect emissions from their supply chains.</P><P>US animal feed manufacturer Cargill, for example, declares its official annual emissions as 15m tonnes. If it included the emissions arising from growing feed crops and their use by livestock then its <mark>climate</mark> impact, according to Global Justice Now’s new findings, would be an estimated 145m tonnes.</P><P>Likewise, Tyson, the largest beef producer in the US, declares its emissions at 5m tonnes but does not include emissions related to the rearing of livestock. If it did its <mark>climate</mark> emissions would be 34m tonnes, suggests the analysis. The report found Yara, one of the world’s fertiliser producers, has a <mark>climate</mark> impact of nearly 75m tonnes, when emissions relating to the use of its fertilisers are taken into account, rather than the 12.5m tonnes that it declares. </P><P>The result is millions of tonnes of <mark>climate</mark> emissions that are otherwise being hidden from public knowledge. In the case of Cargill, its undeclared <mark>climate</mark> emissions of 130m tonnes are comparable to the combined national emissions of Denmark, Bulgaria and Sweden.</P><P>“They shouldn’t be able to indulge themselves in the fiction that they are not culpable for these indirect <mark>climate</mark> impacts,” says Alex Scrivener, policy officer at Global Justice Now and co-author of the analysis, who adds that Yara, Tyson and Cargill are just the “tip of the iceberg” when it comes to evaluating the <mark>climate</mark> emissions produced by agri-food companies.</P><P>Campaigners have been particularly critical of Yara and Tyson for their membership of a two different <mark>climate</mark>-smart agriculture initiatives – the <A href=""http://www.fao.org/gacsa/members/en/"" rel=""nofollow"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Global Alliance on <mark>Climate</mark> Smart Agriculture</A> and <A href=""http://www.wbcsd.org/agri-business-leaders-get-<mark>climate</mark>-smart-at-cop21.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">World Business Council for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development</A>.

				Posted on <A href=""https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/the-effects-of-<mark>climate</mark>-change-on-cargills-supply-chain/"" rel=""bookmark"">November 4, 2017</A></DIV></DIV></HEADER><DIV class=""submission__content entry-content""><P>As some of the physical effects of <mark>climate change</mark> worsen, particularly changes to weather and water patterns, the food and beverage industry is uniquely exposed to these risks.<A href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</A> <mark>Cargill Inc</mark>., one of the largest food and agricultural companies worldwide, has experienced these risks first hand in 2012 when droughts in the US caused its worst quarterly performance in twenty years. <A href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"">[2]</A> As these physical effects continue to intensify, it is imperative that the management of <mark>Cargill Inc</mark>. be concerned with and work toward resolving the impact that <mark>climate change</mark> will have on its supply chain.</P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> has led to several key issues that concern Cargill. First, Cargill’s agriculture commodity trading and processing business is largely dependent on agricultural raw materials, thus during droughts or other significant natural events, Cargill may face supply shortages.<A href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"">[3]</A> Similarly, its’ meat business has suffered significantly because droughts and increased demand for corn in cattle production regions have led farmers to decrease their herd sizes; that, coupled with the increase demand for beef, has caused prices to rise.<A href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"">[4]</A> These supply shortages lead to extreme price volatility, which forces the company to frequently mitigate risks across 7-plus commodities, which can be challenging and expensive.</P><P>While <mark>climate change</mark> puts Cargill’s supply chain at risk, the company is taking several steps in the short and medium term to position itself for sustained success. One of the most effective steps Cargill has taken is acquiring businesses like Joe White Maltings in Australia and Turyag, a Turkish fats and oils producer, to help increase the global footprint of its supply chain. Cargill is also diversifying its business by shifting toward industries that have the most promising growth and less risk tied to <mark>climate change</mark>. For instance, the company looked at projected growth for cocoa ingredients world-wide and noticed that the Asian Pacific region was the major force behind absolute volume growth. As a result, it has spent US$100 million on a new Indonesian plant, along with several other acquisitions, to improve the company’s position in serving growing demand.<SUP>3  </SUP>Cargill is also funding inventions and buying patents to explore ways to improve cell function in plants during exposure to  environmental stress.<A href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"">[5]</A> Lastly, Cargill partnered with the World Wildlife Fund, the Center for American Progress, Mars and others to use technology and “stress test the global food system in a simulation called Food Chain Reaction.” The simulation helped prove that, if corporations work together to make the world’s agriculture systems more resilient, it is possible to feed the growing population. Cargill has committed to continue to do its part in the medium to longer term by advocating for open trade, integrating sustainability measures into its operations and supply chains and applying <mark>innovation</mark> to strengthen the tools farmers need to make the most of their land. <A href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"">[6]</A></P><P>There are still several additional steps Cargill can take to combat the issues it is facing because of <mark>climate change</mark>. For instance, the company should focus more of its resources on lobbying for more mandatory <mark>sustainable</mark> growth practices world-wide; this will benefit not only the food and agricultural industry but also the citizens of the world. Similarly, the company should lobby both to GAAP and IFRS for international tax-credits for the development of additional innovative breakthroughs; this will encourage companies to fund research and create patents just like Cargill did to improve the cells of plants’ ability to survive under significant  environmental stress. Additionally, the company should invest more aggressively to expand its operations into emerging markets; this will help mitigate the risk of limited supply in a given region while also contributing to more top-line growth.</P><P>After conducting this research, one of the biggest open questions I have is as consolidation in the food and agriculture industry continues to happen, what are the unintended consequences that may worsen the issues <mark>climate change</mark> has had on supply chains? If an oligopoly were to form, what laws could governments put in place to ensure that food is still affordable? Separately, are there more aggressive laws or generous incentives governments can implement to ensure more <mark>sustainable</mark> farming and distribution practices?</P><P>Word count: 788</P><P> </P><P> </P><P><A href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"">[1]</A> United Nations Environment Programme, “GEO-5 for Business: Impacts of a Channing Environment on the Corporate Sector” (PDF File), downloaded from <A href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/world/geo-5-business-impacts-changing-environment-corporate-sector"">https://reliefweb.int/report/world/geo-5-business-impacts-changing-environment-corporate-sector</A>, accessed November 4, 2017.</P><P><A href=""#_ftnref2"" name=""_ftn2"">[2]</A> Engel, Hauke et al., “How companies can adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>,” McKinsey &amp; Company Sustainability &amp; Resource Productivity, July 2015, <A href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability-and-resource-productivity/our-insights/how-companies-can-adapt-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability-and-resource-productivity/our-insights/how-companies-can-adapt-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change</A>, accessed November 4, 2017.</P><P><A href=""#_ftnref3"" name=""_ftn3"">[3]</A> Source: <mark>Cargill Inc</mark>.

Their findings, based on scientific and economic research, is that <mark>climate change</mark> poses tremendous risk to American agriculture, business and citizens. The solution is to rapidly adapt and transition to a low-<mark>carbon</mark>, clean-energy economy that also would boost jobs and the economy.</P><P class=""Text_Exploded_Small_NoIndent"">“Transforming the U.S. economy to rely on low-<mark>carbon</mark>, clean energy would be a massive undertaking, but this report shows we can achieve this vision with existing technologies,” the inaugural report said in 2014.</P><P class=""Text_Exploded_Small_NoIndent"">The United States has started to make progress. It concluded that an average of $320 billion a year in private-sector investment is needed through 2050 to build a clean-energy economy and achieve the emissions reductions necessary to avoid the worst economic impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P class=""Text_Exploded_Small_NoIndent"">These investments would be similar in scale to other major investments made by business, including in technology at $350 billion per year over the past decade. They could eventually yield on average up to $366 billion in savings per year from reductions in spending on fossil fuels. The country would gain more than 1 million “new jobs” by 2030. About 270,000 jobs would be lost in the coal and oil industries.</P><P class=""Text_Exploded_Small_NoIndent"">There also will be health benefits from less <mark>pollution</mark>. Page said the evidence indicates <mark>climate</mark> scientists are right and there is challenge and opportunity ahead.</P><DIV class=""related-media ""><DIV class=""related-caption toggle-photo-caption"">
                  Retired Cargill CEO Greg Page is a leader of the Risky Business Project, which advocates to society moving to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy as part of its adaption to <mark>climate change</mark>.
              </DIV></DIV><P class=""Text_Body"">Q: Why is transitioning to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy important?</P><P class=""Text_Body"">A: We should start immediately to make prudent investments that substitute capital for <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. It’s sensible. The benefits of these investments compound over time. For agriculture, we must work on adaptation, research in higher-temperature pollination, drought resistance and increasing soil health and its water-holding capacity. This is critical to global food security.</P><P class=""Text_Body""> </P><P class=""Text_Body"">Q: The farm and food industry, however, are not entirely on board, right?</P><P class=""Text_Body"">A: In agricultural circles, there’s an aversion to [accepting] man-caused <mark>climate change</mark>. My experience is they fear overreach by the government. For us in the food system to be deniers is as arrogant as it is for the true believers who say they know exactly what will happen … that the sea will rise by this much by 2080. I get criticized for talking too much about adaptation. But we can’t presume mitigation will be enough to save the food system.</P><P class=""Text_Body"">We don’t know for sure that enough <mark>carbon</mark>-free electricity can be produced [to achieve an 80 percent reduction in the U.S. <mark>carbon</mark> footprint by 2050].</P><P class=""Text_Body"">It’s engineering and technically feasible by electrifying our economy. It’s very rational. Cost-benefit analysis. Risk-reward. I’m just trying to get people to think about it.</P><P class=""Text_Body"">Q: Does Risky Business advocate a <mark>carbon</mark> tax?</P><P class=""Text_Body"">A: Risky Business did not take a position. However, several members of the advisory group did. They advocated for a revenue-neutral <mark>carbon</mark> tax. Collected on a graduating scale over time. It would motivate more capital through higher returns [to decrease emissions]. In exchange, myriad mandates would be dropped and the market would allocate capital more wisely. The tax would be collected … and returned to citizens on a per capita basis.</P><P class=""Text_Body"">Q: Business and the public seem to be moving in your direction. Your report and others say there is tremendous economic opportunity in clean energy, such as wind and solar, and conservation. Employment growth in those areas is growing much faster than overall employment growth.</P><P class=""Text_Body"">A: Due to <mark>innovation</mark>s that lower the capital cost and increase the efficacy of <mark>carbon</mark>-sparing technologies, the economics are improving and many investments are being made at positive returns over the cost of capital. A modest tax would accelerate investment by improving the returns. For example an overwhelming majority of new buildings feature LED lighting.</P><P class=""Text_Body"">Q: You seem to be trying to find pragmatic common ground here.</P><P class=""Text_Body"">A: All of this boils down to probability. You can find studies that will tell you that you can get a pretty stark outcome based on how much <mark>carbon</mark> there is in the atmosphere. Even if the world collectively held the amount of the <mark>carbon</mark> in the atmosphere where it is now, the half-life of this <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is virtually perpetual. It’s a cumulative problem.</P><P class=""Text_Body"">One group says about a fourth of the <mark>carbon</mark> we put up stays up. The rest gets absorbed in the trees, the soil ... oceans. That’s still about 7.5 billion tons per year that stays up. It’s not exactly settled science. It is broadly accepted as more likely than not.</P><P class=""Text_Body"">Q: Are you concerned about opposition from the Trump administration?</P><P class=""Text_Body"">A: I believe that the private economy in America, and I don’t just mean companies, will make more progress on reducing our <mark>carbon</mark> footprint while sustaining a growing economy and rising standard of living. More than any other country on earth.</P><P class=""Text_Body"">Q: Are you optimistic that the country will get where it needs to fast enough to mitigate dire effects?</P><P class=""Text_Body"">A: I think it’s going to be a very close call.</P><P class=""Text_Endnote""> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Ghana has estimated it has lost 2% of its forests each year, half of which has been attributed to agricultural expansion. That number is suspected to be higher in Côte d’Ivoire. At the same time, global cocoa production increased by 275% between 1961 and 2014, according to UN data.</P><P>“Left unchecked, expanding cocoa production would continue to eat away at forests from Africa to South America, which endangers biodiversity, worsens <mark>climate change</mark> and threatens local livelihoods,” said Rod Taylor, director of the World Resources Institute forests program. “It also hurts the productivity of cocoa farmers by reducing shade cover, disrupting water supplies, and causing soil erosion.”</P><P>This isn’t the first time the globe’s biggest names in chocolate have united for a common mission.

Every few years this flooding is catastrophic, with the Mohana River actually shifting its course from 30-100 feet. Unlike major earthquakes, these flooding disasters get little to no media attention and minimal international funding.</P><P>To help with preparedness efforts in communities along the river, MACP has funded Mercy Corps’ work to install early-warning systems. Simple technology allows communities upstream to share vital changes in the river’s depth and course with their downstream neighbors. Through these early-warnings, communities can prepare and plan ahead to protect and store their food, water, and other assets.</P><P>Knowing that after a flood comes, communities are in dire need of resources, Mercy Corps incorporated a livelihood aspect into their project, which involved planting sugarcane along the riverbanks. Sugarcane is a hardy plant that helps shore up the river from future river-movement and erosion. It’s also a cash crop that isn’t affected by flooding. The sugarcane provides local work and income that is sorely needed for the community to adequately prepare for and recover from recurring flooding.</P><P><SPAN style=""font-size: 14px;""><EM>MACP staff and board visited Nepal and saw Mercy Corps’ work firsthand in February of 2017.

A sequel to the Risky Business Project’s previously released national look at <mark>climate</mark>, the <A href=""http://riskybusiness.org/reports/midwest-report/executive-summary"">“Heat in the Heartland”</A> takes a more targeted approach based on the trends revealed by the national report.</P><P>“The conclusions, which shouldn’t have been surprising, but I think they were to me and a number of others, were how local some of the impacts are and the disproportionate impacts hitting certain industries and certain communities and certain regions,” said Paulson during a live webcast discussion with Page.</P><P>“If you looked at the nation … one of the more likely cases showed a 4 percent decline in agricultural yield,&quot; Paulson said. &quot;But when I looked at southern Illinois and Iowa, there was a very good likelihood they wouldn’t be major corn producers as big shifts in <mark>climate</mark> zones and growing patterns” occurred.</P><P>It troubled Paulson, who, as a farm-kid-turned-treasury-secretary, could appreciate both the micro and macro consequences of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>So could Page, thanks to his years at Cargill, the Minnesota-based global agribusiness company. During the Friday conversation, he pointed to the challenges faced recently on the Mississippi River, which transports crops to market for many farmers.</P><P>“Just the last three years, we’ve seen times when the Mississippi was so low it’s not navigable commercially,” said Page, currently executive chairman of the board at Cargill. “And there have been times when the water was so high we couldn’t get our barges under the spouts. What we’re talking about is more volatility, more extremes in terms of temperature or precipitation.”</P><P>Here are some of the other <mark>climate</mark>-related concerns for Midwestern farming raised in the report:</P><P><STRONG>More crop losses due to heat, especially for corn. </STRONG>“The corn crop is strongly heat sensitive and responds less to the beneficial impacts of <mark>carbon</mark> fertilization than do wheat or soybeans. As a result, the lower half of the Midwest region—the states of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa—will likely suffer significant corn yield losses by mid-century absent adaptation,” the report says.</P><P><STRONG>More problems with weeds and pests.</STRONG>“Warmer winters will also extend the geographic distribution of weeds northward, exposing farms in northern latitudes to new or enhanced threats to productivity. This can increase the cost of weed control, which already has an $11 billion price tag per year in the U.S. alone … Moreover, many invasive species, both plant and insect, may actually benefit more than crops from the increased <mark>CO2</mark> and temperatures brought about by <mark>climate change</mark>, though the relative effect of these factors on crop-weed competition is likely to be species-specific,” the report says.</P><P><STRONG>Less healthy and less productive livestock.</STRONG>“For many livestock species, increased body temperatures of 4°F to 5°F above optimum levels can disrupt performance, production, and fertility, limiting an animal's ability to produce meat, milk, or eggs. Higher temperatures can also increase animal mortality. In addition, <mark>climate change</mark> can affect the price and availability of water, feed grains, and pasture, and change patterns of animal diseases,” the report says.</P><P>Given the importance of agriculture in Midwestern states’ economies, such <mark>climate</mark>-related events would obviously have a financial impact. Illinois, in particular, could be especially hurt if rising temperatures push down corn and soybean production as estimated in the report. “The state stands to lose an estimated $1.5 billion to $13 billion per year from crop losses by the end of the century,” according to “Heat in the Heartland.”</P><P>As sobering as these worst-case scenarios can be, the Risky Business Project leaders hope that the report doesn’t paralyze businesses, but rather spur them to take action and incorporate <mark>climate</mark> issues into their strategic planning.  “Start now, be thoughtful, and plan now for what we think are probable outcomes,” said Page, whose words were amplified by the former Treasury secretary. “We’ve got time to avoid the worst outcomes if we act soon,” Paulson said.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

The report, titled “<A href=""http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RiskyBusiness_PrintedReport_FINAL_WEB_OPTIMIZED2.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Risky Business</A>,” is the first comprehensive assessment of the economic risks of <mark>climate change</mark> to the United States. It was commissioned by a panel of influential business leaders and former government officials, including hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Bush administration Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.</P></DIV></SECTION><P>“I have had a fair amount of experience over my career in attempting to understand and manage risk,” said Paulson, alluding to the 2008 financial collapse. “In many ways the <mark>climate</mark> bubble is actually more cruel and more perverse.”</P><P>Among the study’s conclusions:
</P><P style=""margin-top: -11px"">• By 2050, between $66 billion and $106 billion worth of coastal property will likely be below sea level, rising to $238 billion to $507 billion by 2100.
</P><P style=""margin-top: -11px"">• Extreme storms and hurricanes will likely cause damages exceeding $42 billion annually along the eastern seaboard and Gulf Coast.
</P><P style=""margin-top: -11px"">• Labor productivity, of outdoor workers, such as in construction, utility maintenance, landscaping and agriculture<STRONG>, </STRONG>particularly in the Southeast, could shrink by as much as 3 percent due to the projected number of days with temperatures topping 95 degrees.
</P><P style=""margin-top: -11px"">• Agricultural yields could plummet by as much as 70 percent due to extreme heat waves.
</P><P>The general outlines of the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on the United States have been detailed in series of reports released this year by the <A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch"" target=""_blank"">UN Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark></A>, the <A href=""http://whatweknow.aaas.org"" target=""_blank"">American Association for the Advancement of Science</A> and the <A href=""http://nas-sites.org/americas<mark>climate</mark>choices/events/a-discussion-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change-evidence-and-causes/"" target=""_blank"">National Academy of Sciences</A>.
</P><P>The novelty of the “Risky Business” report, however, is in its detailed assessment of the consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> on specific economic sectors and by region.
</P><P>If there is a simple takeway offered by co-chairs Paulson, Bloomberg and Steyer, it’s that the cost of inaction over the long term greatly exceeds the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to <mark>climate change</mark> in the short term.
</P><P>“If we act quickly we can avoid the very worst outcomes,” said Paulson during a New York City press conference.
</P><P>It’s a message that has begun to gain traction among corporate elites, like Greg Page, executive chairman and former CEO of Cargill, Inc., who participated in the high-level “Risk Committee” that developed the scope of the report and approved its findings.

WRI, which has conducted extensive <A href=""http://www.wri.org/publication/putting-price-<mark>carbon</mark>"">research on <mark>carbon</mark> pricing options</A> and economic growth and has long advocated for a significant price on <mark>carbon</mark>, is a Strategic Partner of the Council.</P><P>Today the CLC unveiled its list of Founding Members. Included are such leading companies as General Motors, Johnson &amp; Johnson, PepsiCo and Proctor and Gamble, and three of the world’s biggest energy companies, BP, ExxonMobile and Royal Dutch Shell.  Individual Founding Members include James Baker III (Secretary of Treasury under President Ronald Reagan and Secretary of State under George H. W. Bush), former NYC mayor Michael Bloomberg, physicist Stephen Hawking, George Shultz (former Secretary of State under President Ronald Reagan) and Greg Mankiw (Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under President George W. Bush), Gregory Page (Executive Chairman of Cargill, Inc.) and Rob Walton (former Chairman of Walmart).</P><P><STRONG>Following is a statement by Andrew Steer, President &amp; CEO, World Resources Institute:</STRONG></P><P>“The <mark>Climate</mark> Leadership Council is bringing bold, fresh thinking to the question of how to reduce U.S. <mark>carbon</mark> emissions in way that is efficient, effective and politically viable. The proposal offers the possibility for a bipartisan approach to addressing <mark>climate change</mark> in a pro-market, pro-growth manner.”</P><P>“I am delighted that the Council has enlisted such prominent companies and individuals as Founding Members. As a CLC Strategic Partner, WRI looks forward to helping to shape and advance the Coalition’s proposal, which has the potential to benefit the economy and rapidly cut U.S. emissions that are exacerbating <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>“A $40 price per ton on <mark>carbon</mark>, rising in a predictable way, could be the centerpiece of U.S. action and leadership on <mark>climate</mark>. WRI analysis suggests it could be good for jobs and good for the <mark>climate</mark>.”</P><P>“In bringing together major companies with prominent thinkers and policy experts across the political spectrum in support of this proposal, the CLC is delivering a clear message to elected officials in Washington: putting a price on <mark>carbon</mark> is a powerful tool for unleashing markets to strengthen the U.S. economy and rapidly reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. President Trump and Congress would do well to heed these voices and put in place policies like the CLC proposal to achieve these twin goals.”</P><P>“To avoid backsliding, existing <mark>carbon</mark> reduction policies should continue until a <mark>carbon</mark> price is put in place that will produce greater emissions reductions. In addition, complementary policies addressing other market failures and non-<mark>carbon</mark> greenhouse gasses will be needed.”</P><P>“While a nation-wide price on <mark>carbon</mark> may seem far off in the U.S., it is gaining traction around the world. <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>pricingleadership.org/who/"">Nearly 40 countries and more than 20 sub-national jurisdictions</A> are now pricing <mark>carbon</mark>. There is also strong and rising support for <mark>carbon</mark> taxes among <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>communication.yale.edu/publications/politics-global-warming-november-2016/"">the American public</A>, including more than two-thirds of all Americans and more than half of Republicans.”</P><P>“We are confident that what seems impossible in the U.S. will soon seem inevitable. Common sense tends to finally win out.”</P><P>To learn more about the proposal and WRI's perspective, read the blog post &quot;<A href=""http://www.wri.org/blog/2017/06/<mark>carbon</mark>-dividend-coalition-grows-raising-hopes-rapid-emissions-cuts""><mark>Carbon</mark> Dividend Coalition Grows, Raising Hopes for Rapid Emissions Cuts</A>.&quot;</P></DIV><DIV class=""block block--callout""><H3 class=""block-title"">Contact</H3></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

This growing population will increase the demand for food, putting further strain on global land and water resources already feeling the pressures of <mark>climate change</mark>. Responding to the urgency of these challenges, the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change brought together experts from academia and industry at a food symposium on November 5, “Feeding the World without Consuming the Planet.”</P><P>MIT Vice President Claude Canizares joined Joint Program on Global Change Co-Director Ron Prinn in opening the event. He highlighted MIT’s dedication to expanding research on agriculture, as urged by President Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology in a report published last December. He also emphasized the Institute’s long history of forming industry collaborations to confront the world’s greatest challenges.</P><P>“MIT’s 150-year history of being devoted to the industrial arts makes us very comfortable to work closely and in real partnership with industry. I can’t think of a more important problem for us to tackle,” said Canizares at the event, which included experts from Cargill, Coca-Cola Co., Mosaic Company, Weyerhaeuser Company, and Bunge Limited.</P><P>Cargill Vice Chairman Paul Conway also gave opening remarks outlining the challenges of increased food consumption, accelerating urbanization, demands for biofuels, and variability in <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>“We see <mark>climate change</mark> as a critical risk. We have to prepare ourselves to make sure we adapt,” said Conway, who also encouraged additional research in science and technology. “To ignore some tools that are available to us that have had a significant impact — particularly in terms of the reduction of chemicals — would be foolish.”</P><P><STRONG>Agricultural resources and inputs</STRONG></P><P>Joint Program Co-Director John Reilly kicked off the first session of the event with an overview of MIT’s work on modeling water stress, resource demands, variability in temperature, and precipitation patterns, and the economic impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on food prices.</P><P>“We need to better understand local and regional <mark>climate change</mark>s and extremes to improve agriculture,” said Reilly, of which the Joint Program is already studying with their Integrated Global System Model (IGSM) — a tool that connects earth and human systems to better predict future <mark>climate change</mark>s.</P><P>Industry is also doing its part to maximize yields and adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>. Reilly’s session focused on two key industries in particular: forestry and fertilizers.</P><P>As fertilizer companies meet growing productivity demands, they must focus on improving resource inefficiencies and misallocations of fertilizer in the developing world, said Michael Rahm of the Mosaic Company. Meanwhile, timberlands management could help mitigate <mark>climate change</mark>, according to Robert Ewing of the Weyerhaeuser Company. Weyerhaeuser is also working with Chevron to research how timber scraps could be used in biofuel production.</P><P><STRONG>Agricultural commodity markets, food, and consumers</STRONG></P><P>The second session of the event progressed up the food production chain and looked at the impacts on prices and trade. Describing the challenge of growing food prices, Professor Thomas Hertel from Purdue University said that there are many factors to watch including biofuel expansion, oil prices, technical capabilities, drops in research and development, and <mark>climate change</mark>. Hertel also explained income rises in the developing world will encourage diets to change and require more land intensive agriculture. Improved efficiency in trade and technology will be essential in meeting the demands of growing affluent societies.</P><P>Stewart Lindsey of Bunge Limited agreed with the importance of trade. “It plays a very important role in the world,” he said. “It really is a mechanism that gives deficit countries — countries that don’t have enough food to ensure security — the ability to do that in a pinch.”</P><P>Only 15 percent of global grains and oilseeds are exported today. By expanding global trade of agriculture, Lindsey suggested we should urge countries to be more efficient by growing and exporting foods based on their locally available resources and <mark>climate</mark> conditions.</P><P>As the food and agriculture industry continues to prepare for <mark>climate change</mark> and increased food demands by supporting agricultural trading, optimized yields, and <mark>sustainable</mark> agricultural practices, Reilly emphasized the important role of academia in such efforts.</P><P>“We look forward to continuing this conversation with collaborators in industry,” he said, “in order to improve our understanding of all these challenges, and find the best ways to adapt to our changing <mark>climate</mark> and resource demands.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></BODY></HTML>"

<BODY class=""default-layout""><DIV id=""news-center-section"" class=""center blog-detail""><DIV id=""news-description-section"" class=""description""><P><I>By 
      <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""mailto:ssellers@bna.com"">Steven M. Sellers</A></I></P><P>Large factory farms increasingly occupy rural landscapes once dotted with small family
   farms, and their concentrated waste has produced a wave of toxic tort litigation.
   
</P><P>Known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, the facilities confine and raise
   large populations of livestock. Environmentalists say these operations supply food
   to such industry giants as Tyson Foods Inc. and JBS USA.
</P><P>Common allegations in CAFO cases—stench from waste lagoons, sinking property values,
   tainted groundwater and swarms of flies—have propelled citizen suits asserting nuisance
   and other torts in Arizona, California, Illinois, Iowa, North Carolina, Wisconsin
   and other farming states. 
</P><P>As lawmakers from these big food-producing states push back with farm-friendly state
   and federal legislation, new liability theories are emerging to counterbalance what
   environmentalists and plaintiffs’ lawyers say are often tough court battles and a
   void in national and local regulatory enforcement. 
</P><P>And lawyers on both sides of the cases agree the legal landscape is expected to change
   even further as a result of a new federal appeals court decision that rejected the
   Environmental Protection Agency’s air emission reporting exemption for CAFOs. 
</P><H5>Real Risks vs. Talking Points</H5><P>Environmentalists and plaintiffs’ lawyers tell Bloomberg BNA that the increasingly
   centralized pockets of cattle, chickens, diary cows and hogs in the U.S. pose nationwide
   health and environmental risks that they are increasingly forced to sue over. At the
   same time, they say ineffective federal regulations and new laws are making it harder
   to prove their cases in court.
</P><P>“EPA recently estimated that there are about 19,000 CAFOs in the country and that
   of those, about three-quarters probably discharge into waterways and should be regulated
   under the Clean Water Act,” Tarah Heinzen, staff attorney for Food &amp;
   Water Watch in Washington, told Bloomberg BNA. 
</P><P>CAFOs are scattered all over the nation, according Food &amp; Water Watch’s interactive
   
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""https://factoryfarmmap.org/"">Food Factory Map</A> analysis of U.S. Department of Agriculture data.
</P><P>“There’s a huge gap in knowledge, both in terms of how many facilities there are across
   the country, which ones are regulated, which ones should be regulated but are not
   and exactly where these facilities are,” Heinzen said.
</P><P>Lawyers for the farms, however, say the risks are well-managed by properly-sited CAFOs,
   and that the operations are an economic necessity protected by right-to-farm laws
   in every state.
</P><P>“There are certain plaintiffs’ groups that fundamentally believe that large animal
   feeding operations are unethical or have no place in the current agricultural industry
   in the United States,” Leah Ziemba, of Michael Best &amp; Freidrich in Madison, Wis.,
   told Bloomberg BNA. 
</P><P>“You see it permeating a number of the legal cases,” said Ziemba, who heads the firm’s
   agribusiness, food and beverage industry group.
</P><P>“Most of the claims about odor and air emissions are talking points we’ve seen a hundred
   times that, frankly, lack a scientific basis for the allegations,” she said.
</P><H5>Wasting Away</H5><P>CAFOs differ from traditional farms because livestock typically don’t graze in pastures.
   They’re confined, supplied with feed, and their waste is collected in lagoons for
   use as fertilizer.
</P><P>EPA regulates CAFOs based on the type and number of animals they confine. It 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/n2x"">defines</A> a large CAFO as an operation that confines, for more than 45 days in a twelve-month
   period, 1,000 or more head of cattle, 700 or more diary cows, 10,000 hogs or 125,000
   chickens. 
</P><P>The farms produce a lot of animal waste. The EPA estimated in 2011 that confined livestock
   in the U.S. generate more than three times the raw waste produced by humans.
</P><P>“Large farms can produce more waste than some U.S. cities—a feeding operation with
   800,000 pigs could produce over 1.6 million tons of waste a year,” according to a
   2010 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/ogE"">report</A> by the National Association of Boards of Health, which has counseled local health
   officials on ways to mitigate potential problems associated with CAFOs.
</P><P>Suppliers used by five major agribusinesses—Tyson Foods, JBS, <mark>Cargill Inc</mark>., Perdue
   Farms Inc. and Smithfield Foods Inc.—produce a 162,936,695-ton “manure footprint,”
   according to a 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/olj"">report</A> issued in 2016 by the 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://www.environmentamericacenter.org/"">Environment America Research &amp; Policy Center</A>, a Boston-based environmental advocacy group.
</P><P>CAFOs of sufficient size are subject to Clean Water Act regulations, but are largely
   exempt from Clean Air Act regulations on the theory that they don’t exceed emission
   thresholds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide.
</P><P>Improperly managed waste can jeopardize public health by sending nitrogen, phosphorus,
   sediments, pathogens, heavy metals, hormones and antibiotics into groundwater, according
   to the EPA and the USDA.
</P><P>A worst-case scenario played out in 1995, when an eight-acre hog farm lagoon 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-recent/6172"">spilled</A> 25 million gallons of effluent into the New River in North Carolina. It caused a
   fish kill, ruined crops and threatened drinking water for downstream communities.
</P><H5>Square Pegs, Round Holes?</H5><P>Ineffective federal regulation of CAFOs is the root of the problem, environmental
   advocates say, citing a pending 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/n7Z"">petition</A> urging the EPA to strengthen its rules.
</P><P>They also say the regulatory vacuum hampers citizen suits filed under such federal
   statutes as the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.
</P><P>“Part of the reason that these tools are often a square peg in a round hole is because
   EPA hasn’t fully utilized its authority under some of these laws to make regulations
   that clearly do apply to this industry,” Heinzen said.
</P><P>“For example, in the Clean Air Act, we have regulation of certain pollutants when
   they are emitted from stationary sources, but EPA has never designated CAFOs as one
   of those source categories,” she said.
</P><P>Another federal law, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs solid
   waste disposals, appeared in a recent CAFO case in reaction to environmentalists meeting
   obstacles in suits under those other federal statutes.
</P><P>Handing a local green group a rare victory against a CAFO under a national law, a
   federal court in Washington state said in 2013 that manure over-applied as fertilizer,
   resulting in runoff rather than absorption, could be solid waste subject to a RCRA
   “imminent endangerment” citizen suit.
</P><P>The ruling came in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington
   in 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Cmty_Assn_for_Restoration_of_Envt__Inc_v_Cow_Palace_LLC_No_NO_13C""><I>Cmty. Assoc. for Restoration of the Environ., Inc v. Cow Palace LLC</I></A>.
</P><P>“The Cow Palace case is obviously an example of plaintiffs looking to other statutes,”
   said Ziemba, who represents dairy farms in New York and Wisconsin. 
</P><H5>Right-to-Know Ruling</H5><P>Another much more recent example of plaintiffs looking for, and finding, new federal
   avenues to sue under—and one that could have wide ramifications for CAFOs across the
   country—is an April 11 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
   Circuit. 
</P><P>The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, an adjunct to the federal
   Superfund law, mandates that industries promptly report air releases of hazardous
   substances, including ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. 
</P><P>In 
   <I><A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/WATERKEEPER_ALLIANCE_ET_AL_PETITIONERS_v_ENVIRONMENTAL_PROTECTION"">Waterkeeper Alliance v. EPA</A></I>, the court said an EPA final rule exempting CAFOs from some federal air emission
   reporting requirements under the right-to-know law was unjustified.
</P><P>EPA said a federal response for CAFO emissions was impractical and unlikely, but the
   appeals court wasn’t persuaded the risk from gases released from routine agitation
   of manure pits is low.
</P><P>“That risk isn’t just theoretical;
   people have become seriously ill and even died as a result of pit agitation,” the
   court said of the need for emission reports.
</P><P>“The D.C. Circuit decision was fantastic, and it was a long time coming,” said Heinzen,
   of Food &amp;
   Water Watch. “This rule had been in place since 2008, and essentially the court held
   that Congress made it very clear that all facilities that report over a certain threshold
   of regulated pollutants have to report.”
</P><P>The ruling, unless it is overturned on appeal, could extend beyond federal cases.</P><P>“It could definitely harm my clients because many right-to-farm laws hinge on whether
   a farm is operating within the constraints of the law,” said defense attorney Todd
   Janzen of Janzen Agricultural Law in Indianapolis. 
</P><P>State right-to-farm laws typically apply a who-was-there-first rule, and protect a
   farm from nuisance liability if it lawfully operated for more than a year and wasn’t
   considered a nuisance when it began.
</P><P>“If you suddenly have a court ruling that says that many farms are not complying with
   the law because they’re not doing air emission reporting, that could potentially impact
   right-to-farm act defenses,” Janzen said.
</P><H5>Nuisance Suits Surge</H5><P>Regardless of environmentalists’ recent victories under the right-to-know law and
   RCRA, state-law nuisance claims, not federal environmental actions, are the bread-and-butter
   of most CAFO cases, some of the lawyers said. 
</P><P>“What I’ve typically seen is a common law civil nuisance approach to challenging CAFOs,
   or challenging them at a local level, such as through zoning hearings,” said Janzen.
</P><P>Some suits, premised on laws that redress odor and other intrusions on private property,
   have hit pay dirt even in very farm-friendly places. Families living in Missouri,
   for example, won an $11 million verdict in 2010 over years of noxious odors from a
   nearby hog farm. 
</P><P>Despite that and similar big ticket awards, more recent trends call into question
   the sympathy juries in agricultural communities may have for farm odor complaints.
</P><P>A spate of nuisance suits filed against Iowa feedlots led to at least one defense
   
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://ktvo.com/news/local/jury-says-cafo-is-not-a-nuisance-no-damages-awarded"">verdict</A> in 2016, and similar suits in Indiana were dismissed for lack of evidence that a
   CAFO had been negligently operated.
</P><P>But many cases are still pending, including dozens on a mass tort docket in the U.S.
   District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, where wholly-owned subsidiaries
   of Smithfield Foods are among the defendants.
</P><P>Residents 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Anderson_et_al_v_MurphyBrown_LLC_Docket_No_714cv00183_EDNC_Aug_21"">claim</A> local hog farms are negligently operated and a nuisance, according to court records.
   
</P><P>There’s irony in the nuisance suit surge, according to Jonathan Lovvorn, a senior
   attorney at the U.S. Humane Society in Washington. 
</P><P>“Prior to 1970, if you had a major <mark>pollution</mark> source, whether it was a cannery, a chemical
   smelter or even a factory farm, your primary remedy was civil nuisance,” Lovvorn said.
</P><P>Exemptions and enforcement problems with both the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water
   Act have turned the clock back, he said.
</P><P>“The net result of this is that this suite of remedies, which was supposed to be a
   major upgrade from 1960s nuisance law, has now become less effective and less used
   than traditional nuisance,” Lovvorn said.
</P><H5>Plucking Legislative Nerves</H5><P>Suits against CAFOs have struck a legislative chord in some states, where new bills
   would apply damages caps in farm nuisance cases and require that plaintiffs foot the
   legal bills if they lose.
</P><P>Iowa enacted such a 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/oan"">law</A> in March, limiting damages to the decrease in fair market value of a property plus
   proven damages, and a similar 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/oao"">bill</A> is pending in the North Carolina legislature.
</P><P>Congress has also been stirred by the litigation. The 
   <I>Cow Palace</I> ruling caught the attention of Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), who introduced legislation
   to “clarify the citizen suit provisions” of RCRA. 
</P><P>The 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/848/text"">Farm Regulatory Certainty Act</A>, H.R. 848, would amend the federal statute to make clear it doesn’t govern animal
   or crop waste from farms.
</P><P>“Continued judicial misinterpretation”
   of RCRA “could pose a very real threat to the vitality of the Nation’s agricultural
   community, which would lead to serious disruptions in the food supply,” the bill says.
</P><H5><mark>Climate Change</mark> Ahead?</H5><P>Lawyers on both sides predict more CAFOs—and more litigation—regardless of regulatory
   vacuums and new laws intended to corral farm litigation.
</P><P>“It is worrisome when you see cases like the Cow Palace case or the D.C. Circuit case,
   where it looks like environmental activist groups are able to chip away at long-standing
   exemptions that agriculture has had under federal environmental statutes,”
   Janzen, the defense lawyer, said.
</P><P>“I see EPA cutbacks as putting a greater burden on state and local governments to
   regulate CAFOs, but I don’t think you’ll see a huge decrease in CAFO regulation,”
   he said.
</P><P>And Lovvorn, of the Humane Society, said he sees a new trend in the making, one that
   may eclipse current litigation themes.
</P><P>This one, he said, is buoyed by the greenhouse effect of methane gases released from
   confined animals.
</P><P>“I personally think the issue of <mark>climate change</mark> and CAFOs is going to become the most
   important issue, potentially overshadowing conventional air and water <mark>pollution</mark> issues,”
   Lovvorn said.

At the same time, despite rhetoric at the COP21 <mark>climate</mark> conference in Paris at the end of December 2015, we are seeing little, if any, action to reduce emissions. </P><P>So it is not surprising that hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated during COP21. These protests were part of a reinvigorated and growing <mark>climate</mark> movement that used the opportunity presented by COP21 to return to the streets. In Britain, as well as elsewhere, this movement has brought together wide social forces, from environmental campaigners and NGOs, to trade unions and left wing organisations. The movement is increasingly taking up wider political demands and, with the popularity of the slogan “System Change not <mark>Climate Change</mark>”, it bears a striking resemblance to the anti-capitalist movement of the early 2000s.</P><P><SPAN>Within the movement important debates are being raised about what needs to be done. The dominant tone of these discussions is left wing, epitomised by the popularity of Naomi Klein’s book </SPAN><SPAN class=""char-style-override-3""><EM>This Changes Everything: Capitalism Versus the <mark>Climate</mark></EM></SPAN><SPAN>.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-number""><A id=""footnote-10080-2-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-2"">2</A></SPAN><SPAN> The book is in part a product of the environmental movement, ­particularly what she calls “Blockadia”, movements that have emerged out of resistance to attempts by fossil fuel corporations to build pipelines, extract shale gas and exploit tar sands. The book has also helped shape the movement itself, leading to debates among activists about the nature of capitalism and its fossil fuel imperative.</SPAN></P><P>But other debates are re-emerging. One that has manifested with renewed force is the question of agriculture, food and <mark>climate change</mark>. On both the London and Paris <mark>climate</mark> demonstrations around the COP21 conference, activists organised blocs calling for veganism to become a significant part of the fight against <mark>climate change</mark>. These blocs were often marked by calls on other activists to change their personal lifestyles to “save the planet”. In London several hundred vegan activists held placards with slogans including “Want to Change the <mark>Climate</mark>? Change Your Diet Go Vegan!” or “Vegan Diet will save the Planet”. The Bristol based vegan campaigning organisation Viva! produced placards reading “There’s no such thing as a meat eating environmentalist”. Such demands contrast with the slogans that have dominated the movement more recently, which demand large-scale state action on <mark>climate change</mark>, such as the call for “One Million <mark>Climate</mark> Jobs”.</P><P>This focus on animal farming has been dramatically fuelled by the popularity of the 2014 film <SPAN class=""char-style-override-3""><EM>Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret</EM></SPAN>. Directed by activist Kip Andersen and filmmaker Keegan Kuhn, <SPAN class=""char-style-override-3""><EM>Cowspiracy</EM></SPAN> has become enormously influential, and after it was updated by executive producer Leonardo DiCaprio and streamed online by Netflix, it has been watched thousands of times. The 90-minute documentary argues that animal agriculture is responsible for 51 percent of global emissions and the systematic destruction of rainforests, as well as wider environmental problems. As the title suggests, it implies a conspiracy involving government bodies, agricultural corporations and environmental NGOs to avoid discussing the role of animal farming in the environmental crisis. </P><P><SPAN>The conclusion of the film is that only a vegan lifestyle can save the planet. And this argument is entering the mainstream of the environmental movement, as one banner on the London march for <mark>Climate</mark>, Justice and Jobs had it, “The No 1 Cause of <mark>Climate Change</mark> is Animal Agriculture”. Demands to reduce meat eating aren’t limited to activists either, with governments and even the UN making similar calls.</SPAN><SPAN class=""char-style-override-2""><A id=""footnote-10080-3-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-3"">3</A></SPAN></P><P>But by emphasising individual behavioural changes as a way of tackling <mark>climate change</mark> this approach fails to challenge the systemic problems with the food system under capitalism, which are the real source of the problem. <SPAN class=""char-style-override-3""><EM>Cowspiracy</EM></SPAN> rightly highlights many problems with modern farming. Its focus, however, is not on the nature of agriculture under capitalism, but one particular aspect of it.<SPAN class=""char-style-override-2""><A id=""footnote-10080-4-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-4"">4</A></SPAN></P><P>Modern agriculture is enormously destructive to the environment. This is the result of a food system driven by profit and dominated by supermarkets and multinationals. As a result the system causes enormous quantities of waste, and holds up a “Western diet” as the ideal. Consumers are then blamed for their bad food choices, with little regard for the context in which those choices are made.</P><P><SPAN>The solution is not individual dietary changes, but a radical transformation of the food system itself. In this article I will explore the environmental impact of agriculture under capitalism, particularly its contribution to <mark>climate change</mark>. I hope this can strengthen the anti-capitalist aspect of the <mark>climate</mark> movement, and in turn the wider revolutionary challenge to capitalism.</SPAN><SPAN class=""char-style-override-2""><A id=""footnote-10080-5-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-5"">5</A></SPAN></P><P class=""x7-subhead""><STRONG>Agriculture and <mark>climate change</mark></STRONG></P><P><SPAN class=""char-style-override-3""><EM>Cowspiracy</EM></SPAN>’s headline figure is that “livestock and their by-products account for…51 percent of all worldwide greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions”.

It originates from a number of sources, such as the decomposition of organic material, but is particularly important in livestock farming because animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and buffalo produce large quantities as part of their digestion. Methane is also emitted when animal manure is stored to be used as fertiliser. Nitrous oxide is emitted mostly through the use of synthetic fertilisers.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>In March 2014, the FAO produced figures showing that in 2011 global agricultural emissions were the highest in history, 5,335 megatonnes of <mark>CO2</mark> equivalent (about 9 percent higher than the average for the preceding decade), and are projected to increase by 30 percent by 2050.</SPAN><SPAN class=""char-style-override-2""><A id=""footnote-10080-12-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-12"">12</A></SPAN><SPAN> The Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) estimates that global emissions from ­agriculture, forestry and other land use are around 24 percent of the world’s total.</SPAN><SPAN class=""char-style-override-2""><A id=""footnote-10080-13-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-13"">13</A></SPAN><SPAN> A 2012 study argues that food systems as a whole contribute between 19 and 29 percent of GHG emissions, of which 80 to 86 percent is from agriculture.</SPAN><SPAN class=""char-style-override-2""><A id=""footnote-10080-14-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-14"">14</A></SPAN></P><P>Agriculture is a large contributor to <mark>climate change</mark> for three main reasons. Firstly, an increasing part of agriculture is the growing of crops to produce feed for animals and biofuels. Secondly, agriculture is a significant cause of deforestation (71 percent of tropical deforestation between 2000 and 2012 was linked to clearances for cultivation<SPAN class=""char-style-override-2""><A id=""footnote-10080-15-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-15"">15</A></SPAN>), and finally the whole of modern, industrialised agriculture is reliant on the use of fossil fuels.</P><P>The growing of crops is the conversion of nutrients from the soil and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere into plants that can be eaten. Some plants cannot be directly eaten by humans but can be consumed by animals, turning them into meat or milk, or giving them energy to pull a plough or transport materials. Since ancient times farmers have known that applying extra nutrients to soil can improve crop yields. Historically animal manure has been used to do this, but from the 19th century onwards, as scientific understanding of chemical processes grew, the application of other fertilisers became common. At first this included sources of nutrients such as ground up bones or bird guano. But, as the industrial revolution developed, artificial fertilisers became the most common way of replenishing the soil. Today the manufacture of fertiliser requires enormous energy inputs from fossil fuels. In the developed world oil is also essential to the harvesting, ploughing and transport of crops and animals, and the food that they are processed into. Another significant use of fossil fuels is in the manufacture of pesticides that are used to kill weeds and insects.</P><P>The rising demand for meat and other products of the meat industry, such as milk, eggs or cheese, means that livestock farming has become enormous. The global population (2013) of chickens is calculated at 21 billion birds, while there are estimated to be 1.4 billion cattle, 1.1 billion sheep and 977 million pigs.<SPAN class=""char-style-override-2""><A id=""footnote-10080-16-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-16"">16</A></SPAN></P><P>Emissions from cattle farming are the single biggest emissions of livestock farming. Most of this comes from beef production (41 percent of total livestock emissions) with 20 percent coming from milk production. In some developing areas of the world, emissions from livestock used for transport or draught-power remain high—accounting for a quarter of emissions in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.<SPAN class=""char-style-override-2""><A id=""footnote-10080-17-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-17"">17</A></SPAN> Environmentalists who argue that stopping <mark>climate change</mark> requires reducing numbers of cattle and buffalo rarely suggest an alternative to those communities who rely on animals for farming and transport.</P><P>The sheer scale of emissions from livestock farming is worth examining. Take the example of the South American beef industry. According to the FAO, this is responsible for 31 percent of the global beef sector. This contributes about 1 billion tonnes of <mark>CO2</mark> equivalent to GHG emissions. There are two main sources of emissions. Firstly, enteric fermentation, the digestive process by which micro-organisms in an animal’s stomach break down food so it can be absorbed into the bloodstream, produces methane (which, for the South American beef industry, is responsible for 30 percent of emissions). Secondly, the use of manure as fertiliser and land-use change, such as deforestation to expand grazing areas, contribute to emissions by 23 percent and 40 percent respectively.<SPAN class=""char-style-override-2""><A id=""footnote-10080-18-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-18"">18</A></SPAN></P><P>Even under the existing system there is potential for significant reductions in emissions. But these will often require technological improvements or changes to agricultural practices, so may be rejected by companies that are unwilling to reduce profits or farmers who lack the capital to introduce them. But they do demonstrate the way a food system that is driven by need, not by profit, could reduce emissions. For instance, the FAO notes that emissions from the livestock sector could be reduced by 18 percent by generalising from the best practices of those with the lowest emissions and by utilising existing technologies, but this is dependent on “conducive policies and market signals” existing to encourage the adoption of these best practices.<SPAN class=""char-style-override-2""><A id=""footnote-10080-19-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-19"">19</A></SPAN> The FAO also notes that reducing deforestation, reducing the expansion of agricultural areas and improving how and where animals are grazed could also lead to the further sequestration of greenhouse gases in soil (some 409 million tonnes of <mark>CO2</mark> equivalent per year). Other practices, such as the sowing of legumes (plants such as peas, clover and beans) on grassland, can significantly improve the ability of the soil to absorb <mark>carbon</mark>.<SPAN class=""char-style-override-2""><A id=""footnote-10080-20-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-20"">20</A></SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Concern about emissions from agriculture is not simply their impact on the environment; emissions also reflect inefficiencies in the agricultural process itself. For example, animal feed is often the most expensive part of livestock farming, and methane emissions represent a waste of the energy input in the form of feed. Therefore reducing emissions can also reduce farming costs through energy reduction in the food system.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-number""><A id=""footnote-10080-21-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-21"">21</A></SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Emissions from livestock agriculture vary dramatically from region to region, often reflecting different types of farming, or land use in the particular region. For instance, globally, land use change is responsible for 15 percent of the beef industry’s emissions, but for chicken production it is 21 percent. This is because land use change originates in deforestation for beef, but for chickens it is related to the production of their soybean feed. This creates a further difficulty in estimating industry emissions, because soybeans are traded internationally so their emissions are attributed in different locations worldwide, but deforestation emissions are considered locally.</SPAN><SPAN class=""char-style-override-2""><A id=""footnote-10080-22-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-22"">22</A></SPAN><SPAN> There is also enormous variety between countries reflecting different industrial practices.</SPAN><SPAN class=""char-style-override-2""><A id=""footnote-10080-23-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-23"">23</A></SPAN><SPAN> But broadly speaking, agriculture in the most affluent areas of the globe has high emissions when measured against the land area. But the emissions per unit of agricultural production are low.</SPAN><SPAN class=""char-style-override-2""><A id=""footnote-10080-24-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-24"">24</A></SPAN></P><P>Production methods can also affect the level of emissions per unit of production. There is a strong negative correlation between the amount of milk produced by cows and emission intensity. In other words, as yield increases, the amount of emissions per unit of production decreases. There are three reasons for this, with implications for reducing total emissions from farming. The first is that as total yields grow, emissions are spread over a larger amount of production. Secondly, improvements in productivity (such as the use of different feeds, mechanised milking machines or drugs to improve production) are often related to improved technologies and practices that can also reduce emissions. Finally, improvements to herd management, as well as animal health and husbandry, “increase the proportion of resources utilised for productive purposes rather than simply being used to maintain the animals”.<SPAN class=""footnote-number""><A id=""footnote-10080-25-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-25"">25</A></SPAN></P><P><SPAN>The use of technology can help reduce both total emissions and the amount of emissions per unit of production at least in some areas of livestock agriculture, such as milk production. Because the amount of methane cows produce varies naturally, current research suggests that selective breeding could mean future animals may be less polluting than currently, even without using extra technologies.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-number""><A id=""footnote-10080-26-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-26"">26</A></SPAN></P><P><SPAN>OECD countries have only 20 percent of the global dairy cows, but produce 73 percent of the world’s milk. Average emissions for OECD milk production are thus much lower than the world in general. The FAO’s case study of this sector suggests that “feasible improvements in manure management, energy use, feed quality and animal performance” could lead to reductions of between 14 and 17 percent of GHGs (which is between 4 and 5 percent of the emissions from the global milk sector). The exact way of doing this would depend on regional factors—in Western Europe better energy use is the most significant factor, while in North America “wider use of anaerobic digesters” to break down animal waste is suggested.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-number""><A id=""footnote-10080-27-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-27"">27</A></SPAN></P><P>But with agriculture, as with other sectors such as energy generation or transport, we have to be wary of simply seeing either technology or particular production methods as necessarily leading to lower emissions. Take chicken farming. There are three types of chicken production: backyard and industrial layers, that produce meat and eggs, and industrial broilers, that produce only meat. Industrial broiler and egg farming has the lowest emission intensity for similar reasons to that of milk production in cows. Chickens running free in a backyard have high emission intensity per egg as the animals grow more slowly and produce fewer eggs, their feed tends to be of lower quality, and the ratio of unproductive to productive animals is higher than in industrial production. So industrial poultry production produces less energy emissions per unit than backyard farming. </P><P><SPAN>However, we must be careful not to lose sight of the wider context. Although industrial poultry farming results in fewer emissions, there are other negatives. Chickens are kept in terrible conditions and live short, often painful lives, with a high usage of antibiotics and other drugs to encourage rapid growth. The use of drugs to produce cheap meat may well have health impacts for consumers. Mass poultry farming is also unhealthy for those who work in the industry—a US Bureau of Labor Statistics report showed that the poultry industry is one of those with the highest levels of occupational illness.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-number""><A id=""footnote-10080-28-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-28"">28</A></SPAN><SPAN> US poultry farming is dominated by a few massive corporations, that contract out the growing of chickens to smaller farms (while the animals themselves remain the property of the corporation). This leads to farmers being trapped in an unequal relationship, at the beck and call of the businesses solely motivated by profits.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-number""><A id=""footnote-10080-29-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-29"">29</A></SPAN></P><P>But when we consider the emissions from pig farming, the “difference in emission intensities between the various production systems is not substantial”. While the majority of total emissions from the pig sector still come from industrial farming, emissions are similar when considered against backyard production. The reason for this is mostly linked to the lower quality of food given to backyard animals (often waste from other sources), which means lower emissions.<SPAN class=""footnote-number""><A id=""footnote-10080-30-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-30"">30</A></SPAN> So it is not automatic that switching to industrialised farming, or to highly technological practices will reduce emissions.</P><P>I will return to strategies to reduce emissions later. But for now it’s worth noting two conclusions. First, there is a large potential to reduce emissions from agriculture and particularly livestock farming. The use of improved technology and other practices can, in certain circumstances, have a significant impact on the amount of emissions. I have already noted the FAO conclusion that emissions could be reduced by between 18 and 30 percent if producers in particular regions were all able to take up the practices used by the 10 to 25 percent of producers who have the lowest emissions.</P><P><SPAN>Secondly, emissions reductions can be achieved in both the developed and developing world, but the methods may vary. High emissions from industrialised farming might be better achieved through “on-farm efficiency, such as better manure management and energy saving devices” but elsewhere better land management, herd management and changes to feeding practices are needed.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-number""><A id=""footnote-10080-31-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-31"">31</A></SPAN><SPAN> There is no one size fits all solution to reducing emissions from agriculture, rather a wide variety of answers.</SPAN></P><P class=""x7-subhead""><STRONG>How <mark>climate change</mark> effects agriculture</STRONG></P><P>Finally, it’s worth highlighting how <mark>climate change</mark> will impact on agriculture. It used to be commonly thought that global warming would be beneficial to farmers, as higher <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels would act as a fertiliser and improve crop yields. While this is true (yields of some crops, such as wheat, can rise by 30 percent if <mark>CO2</mark> doubles), any improvement also depends on other factors such as nutrient levels, water availability and average temperatures. </P><P>Fish and shellfish are highly vulnerable to temperature changes, and increasing acidification of the oceans will further impact on already low stocks. This in turn can have a further negative impact on agriculture as something like a third of the world’s fish catch ends up as animal feed. The practice of feeding farm animals and fish on other fish and krill from the oceans is also significantly damaging to the ocean’s ecosystems. </P><P><SPAN>Extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, are likely to become more intense and frequent as the world warms. Since agriculture is often concentrated in particular regions, this can lead to major risks to crop production. For instance, a third of all wheat, corn and rice that is traded internationally originates in the United States. In 2012 America experienced its worst drought since 1950 with 60 percent of US farms experiencing moderate to extreme drought in August. As a result, corn production was down to 2006 levels and export prices rose by 33 percent in the summer.</SPAN><SPAN class=""char-style-override-2""><A id=""footnote-10080-32-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-32"">32</A></SPAN></P><P>The melting of glaciers also threatens agriculture. In the Himalayas some 15,000 glaciers feed about half the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Indus rivers’ annual flow. As those glaciers melt there will be an initial surge in water levels, but a warming world ultimately threatens a billion people who rely on the rivers’ water. In South America, Andean glaciers supply water and hydroelectric energy to nearly 80 million people.

These have included deforestation, changes to water courses for irrigation and the selective breeding of plants and animals for domestication. Under capitalism, like earlier human societies, we continue to alter the environment and agriculture forms a significant part of this process. But the nature of production under capitalism has meant the transformation of nature has been taken to a new level. John Bellamy Foster, Brett Clark and Richard York have described how Karl Marx developed an understanding of the way that capitalism created a “metabolic rift” in the “exchange between humanity and nature”:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><SPAN>The context was the robbing of the soil of the countryside of nutrients and the sending of these nutrients to the cities in the form of food and fibre, where they ended up contributing to <mark>pollution</mark>.

Sometimes over-use of pesticides was associated with wider environmental destruction (as well as costs to human health). In Indonesia, for instance, in the early 1980s, massive government subsidies for fertilisers and pesticides led to excessive use on rice fields. As well as killing pests, over-use of pesticides also destroyed species that were essential to insect control (such as spiders). When “bad insects” such as planthoppers evolved pesticide resistance, the government had to intervene to ban 75 different insecticides allowing the recovery of insects to control the pests.<SPAN class=""footnote-number""><A id=""footnote-10080-58-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-58"">58</A></SPAN></P><P>One response to this has been for some farmers and consumers to turn to organic crops to reduce the use of artificial pesticides. Organic farming is an attempt to make agriculture more <mark>sustainable</mark>, biologically diverse and healthy by reducing the use of artificial chemicals. For example methods such as crop rotation, manure and cover-crops are used to replenish the soil, rather than relying on artificial fertilisers. </P><P>This is an understandable reaction to industrialised farming, but again we should be wary of neglecting the very real benefits of technological improvements to agriculture as represented by the Green Revolution. For instance, in 1964 India produced 12 million tons of wheat on 14 million hectares; 30 years later production was 57 million tons from 24 million hectares. Calculations show that without the benefits of the Green Revolution, an additional 36 million hectares of farming land would have been needed.<SPAN class=""footnote-number""><A id=""footnote-10080-59-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-59"">59</A></SPAN> Organic farming does not on its own prevent health dangers.

A 2006 report, for instance, concluded that if 10 percent of all US maize were grown organically, it could save 4.6 million barrels of oil. This can also be true of the meat industry. The Soil Association in the UK has calculated that organic milk uses 38 percent less energy than non-organic; for beef the figures are 35 percent less, lamb 25 percent less.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-number""><A id=""footnote-10080-61-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-61"">61</A></SPAN><SPAN> But again we must be wary of seeing these figures out of context.

But the transformation of production would gradually undermine this:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>The socialist regime, by raising living standards all round, assuring security of employment, and comprehensive pensions for old age and sickness, will deflate the value of economic “independence” represented in the private ownership of the farm… Thus the organisation of agriculture in co-operative farms is bound to be an extremely slow process, impeded by some factors that are brought into play by the new socialist regime, not gaining much stimulation from the assumed decline of small farming under the technical superiority of the large ones. The process of the transition of agriculture from individual to collectivist methods will thus be the result of the abundance of wealth and culture in highly developed societies. Individual farming will not be overthrown, but sublimated.<SPAN class=""footnote-number""><A id=""footnote-10080-100-backlink"" class=""footnote-link"" href=""#footnote-10080-100"">100</A></SPAN></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>It is only agriculture like this, rooted in the collective ownership of the land and the means of production, that will be able to produce enough healthy food to feed the world in a <mark>sustainable</mark> way in the long term.</P><P><EM>Martin Empson is the treasurer of the Campaign against <mark>Climate Change</mark> Trade Union group and the author of Land and Labour: Marxism, Ecology and Human History.</EM></P><P class=""notes"">Notes</P><DIV class=""footnote""><P class=""x9-notes""><A id=""footnote-10080-1"" class=""footnote-anchor"" href=""#footnote-10080-1-backlink"">1</A>I’d like to thank Alex Callinicos, Esme Choonara, Sarah Ensor, Suzanne Jeffery, Ian Rappel and Camilla Royle for their comments on drafts of this article.</P></DIV><DIV class=""footnote""><P class=""x9-notes""><A id=""footnote-10080-2"" class=""footnote-anchor"" href=""#footnote-10080-2-backlink"">2</A>Klein, 2015. </P></DIV><DIV class=""footnote""><P class=""x9-notes""><A id=""footnote-10080-3"" class=""footnote-anchor"" href=""#footnote-10080-3-backlink"">3</A>Graham-Leigh, 2014, pp7-8.</P></DIV><DIV class=""footnote""><P class=""x9-notes""><A id=""footnote-10080-4"" class=""footnote-anchor"" href=""#footnote-10080-4-backlink"">4</A>It is worth noting that <SPAN class=""char-style-override-3""><EM>Cowspiracy</EM></SPAN> never mentions any agricultural corporations, nor does it investigate food production outside of the United States so there is no attempt to discuss the question of livestock agriculture in the developing world, or the role of animals (such as for ploughing or transport) in agriculture outside of their use for meat, milk and eggs.</P></DIV><DIV class=""footnote""><P class=""x9-notes""><A id=""footnote-10080-5"" class=""footnote-anchor"" href=""#footnote-10080-5-backlink"">5</A>Because this article focuses on the question of agriculture and <mark>climate change</mark>, some of the wider debates are only touched on or omitted entirely.

But in a cluttered and fluorescent-lit room, three geographic information systems (GIS) analysts are hunched over their computer screens searching satellite maps for signs of fresh deforestation in South America's Gran Chaco forest, doing the best they can. &quot;The Chaco is one of the most unknown remaining wildernesses on our planet,&quot; says Alberto Yanosky, the activist in charge of those analysts. The problem though, is that &quot;we're losing the Chaco faster than scientists can study it.&quot;</P><P>The Gran Chaco, which cuts across parts of Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil, is Latin America's second most important forest, behind only the Amazon in terms of size and biodiversity. While the Amazon is a lush tropical world of wide rivers and towering trees, the Chaco, located to the south, is a dry 250,000-square-mile area with some of the highest temperatures in the world and some of the most meager rainfall.</P><P><A class=""inStoryLink"" href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/feature/belly-beast-meat-factory-farms-animal-activists"" target=""_blank"">Animal Cruelty Is the Price We Pay for Cheap Meat</A></P><P>But while the Amazon has an institutional charity system fighting for its survival, hardly anyone outside of South America has heard of the Chaco. That PR void has allowed U.S.-based agribusiness giants <mark>Cargill Inc</mark>., Bunge Ltd. and Archer Daniels Midland Co. to aggressively expand in Paraguay with a minimum of international scrutiny or outcry. <mark>Sustainable</mark> business gurus praise those companies for having saved the Amazon, and the companies themselves say they've adopted conservation policies that prove it's possible to feed the world's exploding population without putting much more land into cultivation. In Paraguay, however, the opposite has occurred. The factory farming system has advanced across the country's most fertile areas. In the last decade alone, 2.5 million acres have been turned into soybean fields, displacing subsistence farmers and cattle barons alike. (Those with the wherewithal purchased cheaper land in the Chaco forest, part of the rush that has helped make the Chaco one of the world's top deforestation hot spots.)</P><P>Last year alone, the Gran Chaco lost 914 square miles of forest, the equivalent, according to Yanosky's organization, Guyra, of 29 cities the size of Buenos Aires. During the first five months of this year, 1,040 acres — a little more than 1.6 square miles of forest a day — were bulldozed and burned in the Paraguayan portion of the Chaco. GIS analyst Fernando Palacios, a boyish 29-year-old, says it's dispiriting to watch what's happening.</P><P>&quot;Every month we detect all these areas that have been lost,&quot; he says. &quot;It doesn't give you much hope.&quot; Gurya sends its satellite images to members of parliament and the press, hoping to influence policy and public sentiment. But most shock about the ecological <mark>devastation</mark> has long since worn off.</P><P>What's going on in Paraguay follows a familiar pattern in countries blessed with lots of biodiversity and saddled with a struggling economy. Typically cattle ranchers are among the first to settle a virgin forest. Eventually their footpaths become dirt roads linking a once isolated area to ports and population centers. Land prices soar and pioneers sell or get pushed out by deep-pocketed farmers with access to bank loans, Big Ag financing, influential friends and high tech machinery. Once a former wilderness has been sufficiently tamed, the factory farmers often bypass the pioneers and bulldoze virgin forest themselves, going directly into commodities production. This is what's starting to happen in the Chaco.</P><P>There is one big difference: Even as deforestation shifts into hyper-drive, the U.S. agribusiness companies that set this domino effect in motion are taking victory laps on the &quot;corporate sustainability&quot; circuit. For instance, Cargill, the Minneapolis-based company (and the United States' largest privately-held corporation) that has spent millions of dollars to brand itself as a corporate conservationist, claims it has &quot;figured out&quot; how to make industrial scale agriculture environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark>. To get its Amazon farmers to go along with those sustainability efforts, it has its own satellite monitoring system that can detect even the smallest amount of fresh deforestation. Next door in Paraguay, however, small rectangles flashing on a computer screen reveal just how different the rules are outside of Brazil.</P><P>(Below: Satellite images showing deforestation in Paraguay’s Gran Chaco forest over the last three decades.)</P><P>In Guyra's makeshift space, located on an upscale residential street in Paraguay's capital city, maps of the Chaco hang on the walls and <EM>roc-n-</EM><EM>español </EM>plays softly in the background as Palacios and his coworkers spend about two weeks every month looking for evidence of deforestation. Digital squares and rectangles indicating cleared land flash orange and hot pink on their computer screens, while what's left of the trees is represented in shades of green. A decade ago, there was a lot more green space. Now the satellite map of the Chaco has an epicenter of deforestation in the middle, surrounded by faint lines representing new roads. </P><P>Guyra (pronounced &quot;we-rah&quot; which means &quot;bird&quot; in the indigenous Guaraní language) was founded in 1997. It has a few dozen employees at its headquarters, a couple of blocks from the U.S. embassy, and a handful of other offices around the country. It's funding comes largely via donations from Paraguayan nature lovers and international organizations such as Birdlife International and the Inter-American Development Bank. Palacios and his colleagues use a tool in their computer program to highlight new cattle ranches and farms, flagging freshly cleared properties often made up of 100,000 acres or more. Many of these supersized ranches are owned by Paraguayans who sold their holdings to agribusiness farmers in the eastern part of the country, where land can run $20,000 an acre. That's a very different market than the Chaco, where prices are typically a few hundred dollars per acre. The cheap land has also attracted buyers from Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, where world demand for beef and soybeans has also driven up rural land prices.</P><P>On a Guyra computer screen, the light-green farmland of Estancia Yerovia, located about 150 miles east of the Bolivian border, is flanked by much darker patches of virgin forest. I had heard rumors of a new soybean plantation there, deep in the central Chaco, perhaps the most remote Latin American outpost of the multinational agribusiness empire. And indeed, on the northwest corner of the screen, an area is outlined in bright red, indicating fresh deforestation.</P><P>There is, however, only so much you can tell from staring at a computer screen. So I boarded a bus that drove all day through ranchland and forest, eventually arriving in Filadelfia in the Central Chaco, an orderly Mennonite city where large homes and ample lawns give the illusion of someplace else, possibly suburban Texas. From Filadelfia, it's about a two-hour drive to Estancia Yerovia. Within a few minutes, as the last houses disappear in the rearview mirror, cropland and cattle ranches begin to fringe the roadside. At first the highway is smooth. Later, it deteriorates into a thin streak of skimpy asphalt. The potholes are as big as bathtubs. </P><P>Thorny underbrush and occasional palo santo and quebracho trees begin to crowd in. A poisonous snake, known to the locals as the <EM>jarara</EM>, crosses the hot asphalt and jabiru birds glide overhead. The temperatures are in the mid-80s, which is unusually moderate for the Central Chaco, where the heat typically soars well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit during the height of summer. Foxes, rabbits, armadillos and lizards occasionally peep out from the shoulder of the road. Eventually a dirt road at &quot;kilometer 543,&quot; snakes off to the north, leading to a farm.</P><P>Heading toward the soybean fields, there's a queue of cargo trucks waiting to load the harvest. The soybean plants have already been sprayed with a chemical to dry them out so that the John Deeres standing by can get to work harvesting them.</P><P>An unusually wet summer has produced bumper crop —&quot;historic,&quot; says Eduardo Aguero, the farm manager. A clean-cut agricultural engineer from Santa Rita, a soy hub in eastern Paraguay, Aguero commutes back and forth from Filadelfia each day. Aguero's employer, Cresca, S.A., is a joint venture between two Argentinean firms engaged in a sort of Big Ag real estate flipping operation inspired by the ravenous global demand for soybeans. They cleared the old growth forest here in 2009 and now have soybeans and a few other crops growing on about 100,000 acres divided into three farms. If all goes as planned, the company will sell the farms and develop another 250,000 acres of adjacent forest into soybean plantations over the next few years. A decade ago, I'm told, the land was probably worth no more than about $20 an acre. Today, Aguero says even undeveloped land in the area now sells for more than ten times that amount. </P><P>Small and yellow, soybeans go into a variety of products — tofu, soymilk and biofuels, among others — but the vast majority of world production is used for animal feed that eventually ends up on dinner tables in the form of beef, pork and chicken. &quot;Without a doubt,&quot; says University of Illinois economist Mary Paula Arends-Kuenning, &quot;demand for soybeans will continue to grow because of the growing middle classes in countries like China, Brazil, Russia and India where people are eating more meat.&quot; In the early 1960s, slightly less than 29 million metric tons of soybeans were grown globally each year. By the 2013-2014 growing season, production had risen to an estimated 283.8 million metric tons, according to recent USDA World Agricultural Supply and Demand estimates.</P><P>There's not much of a domestic market in Paraguay for soybeans, but producing them for <A href=""http://atlas.media.mit.edu/profile/country/pry/"">export</A> has become one of the most important drivers of the country's estimated $29.95 billion GDP. Little of South America's soy makes it directly into the United States, where high tariffs represent a major obstacle to importers. But the three biggest agricultural middlemen companies that buy the soybeans from farmers and sell them abroad are all based in the U.S.</P><P>Those companies — Cargill, Bunge and ADM — dominate the world agricultural commodities markets that feed the supply chains of a myriad of industries from food and beverages to plant-based plastics and paints. Together, the three conglomerates export the vast majority of Paraguay's crops. Worldwide, they sell <A href=""http://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/rr-cereal-secrets-grain-traders-agriculture-30082012-en.pdf"">most of the grains</A> and much of the meat and other ingredients that go into the food we've all eaten. Soybeans, in a variety of forms, end up in Hellmann's Mayonnaise, Nestlé Toll House chocolate chips and Jif peanut butter. Soybeans are fed to the poultry that we later eat as McDonald's Chicken McNuggets, and soybean oil fries up KFC original recipe. Soybeans are, almost literally, everywhere.</P><P>While Cargill, Bunge and ADM aren't household names on par with Apple and Amazon, they're arguably far more important, having, along with a few other multinational traders, devised the factory-farm concept and reaping the bulk of the profits. They exert influence over farmers from Argentina to Zimbabwe, deciding where crops will expand next and who is eligible for the credit lines the companies provide to farmers to pay for seeds, fertilizer and other essentials for industrial-scale farming.</P><P>Deals for purchasing the harvest and at what price are struck even before planting. This year, Aguero says the Estancia Yerovia harvest will produce about 28.6 million pounds of soybeans. The beans have already been sold to Bunge. Last year, Aguero says, the crop went to Cargill and ADM. While all three of the companies say environmental sustainability is central to their corporate values, their vows to keep their supply chains from expanding into virgin forest apparently don't apply in the Chaco.</P><P><ASIDE class=""inset-image inset-full""><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">A tractor mows down old-growth trees in the Gran Chaco Forest in Paraguay.</SPAN><SPAN class=""credit"">Courtesy of Guyra Paraguay</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></ASIDE></P><P>The Paraguay River, which runs down the middle of its namesake country, is a physical divider between two regions that might as well be two different worlds. While the Chaco is a flat and arid forest with an abundance of wildlife but hardly any people, eastern Paraguay is a lush farmscape, where 97 percent of the country lives clustered in Asuncion and a few provincial cities. It rains year-round in the east, allowing for as many as five harvests every two years. Driving down la Ruta 6 highway through this perpetual summertime world, the patchwork of cropland in green, brown and gold stretches beyond the horizon. Occasional small islands of old growth forest stand amid gently waving fields of grain.</P><P>As recently as the Seventies, this entire agricultural belt was almost all forest: el Bosque Atlántico, (the Atlantic Forest), a &quot;biodiversity hotspot&quot; reaching from Brazil's Atlantic coast across a broad swath of South America. Today only about seven percent of Paraguay's Atlantic Forest remains. With little public outcry, the region was transformed into cow pastures and cropland almost entirely in violation of a 1973 law requiring landowners to set aside 25 percent of each parcel as forest and preserve natural greenery around rivers and streams as a bulwark against erosion and water <mark>pollution</mark>. Cargill was the first of the Big Ag companies to establish a beachhead in Paraguay, setting up here in 1978. The company stepped up investments here a decade ago, breaking ground on a major soybean processing and export plant, <A href=""http://www.cargill.com.py/Contents/info.asp?ch=2000592&amp;id=2017233"">Puerto Unión</A>, in 2006. That was the same year that Cargill, along with the other two big grain traders, signed a voluntary moratorium on purchasing soybeans from Brazilian farmers growing the crop on freshly deforested Amazon land. Three years later, it extended sustainability commitments company wide, issuing &quot;guiding principles,&quot; a set of commitments to &quot;practices that create a balance between production and social and environmental questions.&quot; </P><P>While the company has been rightly lauded for its Amazonian initiatives, in Paraguay, however, it appeared that those guiding principles were not in effect. Cargill's new Puerto Unión port opened in 2011, consolidating the company's position as Paraguay's biggest crop exporter, commercializing an annual 1.4 million tons of soy, about 30 percent of the country's harvest. Since then ADM and Bunge have also opened new soybean crushing plants, more than <A href=""http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/Oilseeds%20and%20Products%20Annual_Buenos%20Aires_Paraguay_2-26-2014.pdf"">doubling the country's capacity</A> to process the crop each year.</P><P>The massive scale of this U.S.-style of agribusiness means farming in Paraguay looks much the way it does in, say, Iowa. &quot;It really follows the principals of industry,&quot; says Timothy Griffin, a professor of nutrition science and policy at Tufts. &quot;You bring together a set of inputs and use them to produce as much output as you can.&quot; In the process, Griffin explains, the land &quot;goes from a complex ecological system to about the simplest ecological system that you could envision.&quot; Water <mark>pollution</mark> from chemical runoff and erosion, says Griffin, are &quot;much more likely to occur in those simple industrial-modeled systems than they are in a natural system.&quot;</P><P>Until running into opposition from Amazon activists, the three Big Ag companies had operated for more than a century, building vast global operations in relative obscurity. That began to change in the early 2000s when conflict in the Amazon came to a head. Cargill was building a soybean port in Santarém, an Amazon River outpost deep in the rainforest. To environmentalists, the development looked like a calculated bid to advance the Amazon's soybean frontier in Brazil. Even before it was finished, the new port was &quot;clearly causing deforestation,&quot; says David Cleary, director of agriculture for the Nature Conservancy, who was based in Brazil at the time.</P><P>In 2006, Greenpeace pointed the finger at Cargill in a scathing report titled &quot;Eating Up the Amazon,&quot; and sent its campaigning ship, <EM>The </EM><EM>Arctic Sunrise, </EM>to blockade the port. They then targeted for protest McDonald's and other consumer companies that bought Cargill's soybeans. The effort achieved international attention and caught the company along with its two biggest rivals, Bunge and ADM, in an undesired spotlight. &quot;The global response from consumers and customers,&quot; acknowledged Cargill in its corporate magazine &quot;Cargill News,&quot; in 2010, &quot;ranged from concern to outrage.&quot; So they decided to act.</P><P>Before 2006 was out, Cargill, ADM Bunge and the rest of the Brazilian industry signed a voluntary agreement, called the Soy Moratorium, not to purchase crops from Amazon farms that had deforested after 2006. The moratorium is still in place and has been has helped slow the Amazon deforestation rate. The company also hired the Nature Conservancy to help its Santarém-area growers come into compliance with Brazilian Forest Code, which required landowners to set off a portion of their properties as forest reserves. The Cargill News article from 2010 noted, &quot;Santarém farmers who deforested land after 2006 could not sell their soybeans to Cargill, losing their only commercial market. Evading the moratorium on deforestation was impossible because satellite imaging technology could detect even small reductions in forest cover.&quot;</P><P>In the process, the Santarém operation was transformed from international public relations debacle into the crown jewel of Cargill's corporate sustainability program. Greg Page, executive chairman of Cargill's board of directors, <A href=""http://www.cargill.com/news/releases/2012/NA3058597.jsp"">told an audience</A> at a sustainability conference that the Brazilian conservation commitments proved, &quot;We can feed the world with very small increases in the number of acres brought into production.&quot;</P><P>When it comes to soy, however, the Amazon project has contributed only a tiny amount to Cargill's global soybean sales. Ruth Rawling, Cargill's vice president for global issues management, acknowledges that even after a decade &quot;If you put it [the volume of sustainably grown soybeans in the Amazon] against the overall soya that we've exported from Brazil, it's pretty small. We're talking a couple of percent at most.&quot; And that's true beyond Cargill too. The Round Table on Responsible Soy — an initiative started by World Wildlife Fund that brought the three Big Ag companies together with environmentalists to create the world's first certification program for responsibly produced soy in 2011 — still has only certified a total of about three million metric tons , less than 0.5 percent of the <A href=""http://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/latest.pdf""> global harvest</A><FONT class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#008000""> </FONT>during the same three year period. Whatever minimal efforts to grow soy more sustainably in Brazil now exist, they are even less impressive in Big Ag's newer frontier: Paraguay. ADM says it has a sustainability program involving nearly 125,000 acres — a paltry sum when considered against Paraguay's 7.9 million of acres of soybean fields. </P><P>As for Cargill, the company does have a semblance of a sustainability program in place. Nearly 30 percent of the soybeans it buys in Paraguay are produced on land that company spokesperson Susan M. Eich says &quot;was already in production before January 2008 and therefore was not from a protected area, reserve or forest.&quot; Eich says Cargill pays two independent companies to ensure the truth of those claims and compliance with two different international <mark>sustainable</mark> soy certification programs and to train the farmers in &quot;best agricultural practices.&quot;</P><P>And yet it's been illegal to convert forests to cropland in the eastern agricultural belt since Paraguay passed a zero deforestation law for the entire Atlantic Forest region in 2004, which means Cargill is merely verifying that its farmers aren't blatantly breaking the law. The program's contribution to environmental sustainability in Paraguay is dubious. In fact, it may be having an opposite effect. Several observers inside Paraguay told me the pressure to preserve what little remains of the Atlantic Forest has driven up real estate prices for pastureland in that region, pushing cattle ranching into the Chaco's virgin forest. That suggests Cargill's sustainability program is one of those &quot;true lies&quot; common to corporate good citizenship claims; it manages to be factually correct while still in service to a larger fiction. </P><P>Similarly in Brazil, the company only reigned in farmers turning forest into fields in the Amazon, where Brazilian law enforcement officials — and Cargill's own customers — were cracking down. But Rawling says the true impact of Cargill's sustainability commitment in Brazil shouldn't be judged by the number of soybeans it produces but by its impact. She says the company's satellite program inspired the Brazilian government to launch its own &quot;eye in the sky&quot; policing technology, which it will soon expand to the entire country's agricultural production. But even though Cargill had the technology and spent the last 10 years perfecting its satellite-verified sustainability program in the Amazon, Cargill never voluntarily expanded this satellite-verified sustainability program to its growers throughout Brazil. Only now, as Brazilian officials expand satellite policing nationwide, is Cargill preparing for a day when all of its growers are in full compliance with the Brazilian Forest Code. &quot;In years to come, &quot;Rawling says, &quot;we will at some point only source from farms that are registered and environmentally licensed. And not only us but the entire industry.&quot;</P><P>But Rawling also suggests that Paraguay is a uniquely difficult circumstance, and that a company needs to be able to work in concert with a given country's government in order to achieve whatever righteous environmental aims it may have. &quot;The Paraguayan and Brazilian governments have different policies in this respect,&quot; she says about conservation, &quot;which makes it harder — it's harder for a company to operate, to influence what's happening in agriculture if the government is going in completely the opposite direction.&quot;</P><P>On the surface, Big Ag's increased presence in Paraguay has been good for the country's economy. Soybean receipts propelled the country to a massive 13 percent growth rate last year. In January, international investors snapped up the first dollar-denominated bonds the country has issued in its 203-year history. Then, in April, the government released new figures showing that the official poverty rate fell dramatically, from 32 percent to 24 percent between 2011 and 2013, with the most dramatic decline — 45 percent to 34 percent — in rural areas. But with factory farming in the neighborhood in those regions, land prices have soared and peasants have been pushed out. There were about a quarter of a million family farms primarily in the country as recently as the Eighties. Only about 80,000 remain today.</P><P><ASIDE class=""inset-image inset-full""><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">An aerial view of the Chaco region of Paraguay.</SPAN><SPAN class=""credit"">Noah Friedman–Rudovsky</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></ASIDE></P><P>Reyaldo Diaz, a lanky 20-year-old in a blue-and-red soccer jersey, is traveling aboard a creaky public bus on his way back to la Escuela Agrícola de Belén, a farm school in a region bordering the Chaco where he's one of 50 students learning how to use heavy machinery and other &quot;agro-industry.&quot; He says his family tried its luck in the city of Ciudad del Este, near Brazil, where his older brothers still do factory work.

(Cartes' predecessor, the leftist President Fernando Lugo, was swept from office in 2012 an impeachment carried out by the Paraguayan Congress after a conflict between police and peasants being forced off their land to make way for Big Ag soybean fields left 17 dead.) Longer term, Cartes wants to transform the nation into a college-educated &quot;knowledge society,&quot; according Gustavo Leite, Paraguay's Minister of Industry and Commerce. Achieving &quot;Cartes' Vision,&quot; Leite says, will depend on consolidating Paraguay's place as &quot;a food producer for the world.&quot;</P><P>But those under 30 years of age represent Paraguay's largest demographic group, and economic experts here say it will be difficult to generate enough factory and service industry jobs for the young people abandoning subsistence agriculture in droves. (The country's rural population declined from 49.7 percent in 1992 to 35 percent in 2012.) Since agribusiness uses lots of heavy machinery but few farmworkers, a growing portion of society is scrambling to invent jobs for themselves — selling fruit on street corners, washing windshields and taking odd jobs.</P><P>An opinion poll published in May, reported three-quarters of Paraguayans disapprove of the government's performance. No doubt much of this has to do with the rampant corruption that landed Paraguay at 150 of 177 countries on Transparency Internationals'<A href=""http://www.transparency.org/country#PRY"">Corruption Perceptions Index</A>. But the country's shifting economy is clearly also to blame, as its agriculture-without-people boom is stoking social tensions. A fledgling revolutionary group, the Paraguayan People's Army, made headlines last spring after kidnapping the 16-year-old son of a prominent landowner in the north of the country. Peasants in the eastern agricultural belt, meanwhile, have protested the proliferating foreign-owned factory farms and the frequent fumigations that they say are forcing them to abandon the countryside, leaving it to the genetically modified soybeans that now cover more than 7.9 million acres of Paraguay's most fertile land.</P><P>Perhaps most troublingly, President Cartes during a speech welcoming the Brazilian National Industrial Confederation earlier this year urged visitors to &quot;<A href=""http://www.nanduti.com.py/v1/noticias-mas.php?id=83339"">use and abuse Paraguay</A>.&quot;</P><P><ASIDE class=""inset-image inset-full""><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">Alberto Yanosky inside Defensores del Chaco national park.</SPAN><SPAN class=""credit"">Courtesy of Guyra Paraguay</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></ASIDE></P><P>Guyra estimates that by 2035 there will be no more forest in the Chaco left to cut down. &quot;People inside the country,&quot; says analyst Palacios, &quot;don't care much about deforestation.&quot; There are also strong disincentives in play — Guyra's office was bombed in the early 2000s, when the group first started using satellite imagery to call attention to deforestation. &quot;People could not believe that we were able to monitor land use changes in almost realtime<INS cite=""mailto:David%20Marchese"" datetime=""2014-06-16T17:22"">,</INS>&quot; Guyra executive director Yanosky says. For his efforts, Yanosky and his daughter received death threats. The culprits remain unknown.</P><P>Cargill's Rawling says the company, regardless of good intentions and its success in preserving the Brazilian Amazon, may be powerless to stop the irreversible destructive practices in Paraguay that long ago decimated so much of the world's rainforests.</P><P>&quot;If a government is intent on opening up a lot of areas for agriculture,&quot; she says, &quot;it may not be that easy for a company to stop that happening.&quot;</P><P>Not everyone sees it that way, however. Ironically, Big Ag concerns like Cargill hold the key to developing the country without further un<mark>sustainable</mark> environmental degradation. &quot;They are the ones that are going to change the business,&quot; says Lucy Aquino, executive director of WWF Paraguay. &quot;We need to focus on them.&quot; The Nature Conservancy is pressing Cargill and its competitors to agree to conservation rules for farming other ecologically sensitive South American hotspots where the soy frontier is poised to expand, and trying to expand its conservation partnership with Cargill into the Argentine Chaco and, hopefully, Paraguay.</P><P>But barring swift and radical change, and with soy cultivation having now firmly established in the Chaco, deforestation in the region looks unlikely to let up. &quot;We often tell each other,&quot; laments Yanosky about long-ago deforestation in the Atlantic Forest, &quot;'if we had known what was going on, we would have done something.

They are feeding on stale bread, rotting mangoes, overripe cantaloupe and squishy zucchini. </P><P>But this is no garbage dump. It’s a farm. </P><P>Enterra Feed, one of an emerging crop of insect growers, will process the bugs into protein-rich food for fish, poultry - even pets. After being fattened up, the fly larvae will be roasted, dried and bagged or pressed to extract oils, then milled into a brown powder that smells like roasted peanuts. </P><P>The small but growing insect farming sector has captured attention and investments from some heavyweights in the $400 billion-a-year animal feed business, including U.S. agricultural powerhouse <mark>Cargill Inc</mark> [CARG.UL], feed supplier and farm products and services company Wilbur-Ellis Co and Swiss-based Buhler Group, which makes crop processing machinery. </P><P>Fast food giant McDonald’s is studying using insects for chicken feed to reduce reliance on soy protein.  </P><P>“This pioneering work is currently at the proof-of-concept stage,” Nicola Robinson, McDonald’s Corp <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain manager, told Reuters. “We are encouraged by initial results and are committed to continuing to support further research.”</P><P>The fact that such global food production giants are turning to insects illustrates the lengths they will go to find alternative sources of protein that are profitable and <mark>sustainable</mark> as animal feed or additives to human food. Bugs are just one many alternatives being studied or developed by major agricultural firms. Others include peas, canola, algae and bacterial proteins. </P><P>Global population growth and an expanding middle class have raised per capita meat consumption by 50 percent over the past four decades, fueling fears of a protein pinch. Traditional sources of the key macronutrient are growing increasingly unreliable amid a changing global <mark>climate</mark> and worries about the environmental impacts of row-crop farms and commercial fishing. </P><P>(For a graphic on rising meat consumption, see: <A href=""https://tmsnrt.rs/2INBgFY"">tmsnrt.rs/2INBgFY</A> ) </P><P>Benoit Anquetil - strategy and technology lead for Cargill’s animal nutrition business - called developing new sources of protein a “long-term opportunity.”</P><P>“<mark>Sustainable</mark> protein is a key challenge, which is why Cargill is evaluating the viability of insects as part of the solution to nourish the world,” Anquetil said. </P><P>People tend to pivot from grain- and plant-based diets to meat-based meals as they grow wealthier. The problem is that as meat demand grows, feed production needs to grow faster. It typically takes about two pounds of feed to produce a pound of chicken. For pork, it takes four pounds. </P><P>Expanded cultivation of soybeans - the foundation of livestock and poultry rations for decades - is not a long term solution because it contributes to deforestation and overuse of harsh farm chemicals. </P><P>In addition, supplies of fishmeal - an aquaculture feed made from wild-caught fish and fish by-products - have fluctuated wildly with climactic cycles, overfishing and regulation to prevent it. </P><P>Nutritionists and scientists have long touted insect consumption for humans as a <mark>sustainable</mark> and cheap source of protein, but snacking on bugs is a stomach-churning prospect for people in many countries and cultures. Introducing insect protein further down the food chain may be more palatable. </P><P>The bug business still has a few hurdles ahead - like the yuck factor, even when the insects are fed to animals. Regulators will also need to be convinced that ground-up bugs won’t introduce new toxins into the food supply. </P><P>“They are considered filth in the food system,” said Virginia Emery, CEO of Beta Hatch, which grows mealworms above an auto body shop near Seattle-Tacoma Airport. </P><H3>FEEDING BUGS TO FISH </H3><P>Cargill conducted an insect-based feed trial on poultry in 2015, but the company’s efforts with insects have since focused on bolstering its growing aquaculture business, where demand for alternative proteins is most acute. </P><P>Beta Hatch is chasing the same market. The small company’s mealworms - larvae of the mealworm beetle - will likely end up as fish food as Emery expands her business with the help of an investment from Wilbur Ellis, whose fish-farming customers have pressed for <mark>sustainable</mark> alternatives to fishmeal. </P><P>“Fishmeal has a limited supply, and aquaculture is continuing to grow,” said Andrew Loder, president of Wilbur Ellis’ feed division. “We see insect meal as one piece of a solution.”</P><P>Fish farming is growing fast with growing consumer demand and increasing concerns about overfishing, resulting in catch restrictions in many depleted fisheries. Warming oceans in some areas have also disrupted supplies. </P><P>That means fish eaten by humans will increasingly come from farms - driving up demand and prices for fish feed. </P><DIV class=""container_1tVQo"" tabindex=""-1""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption_KoNH1""><SPAN>Black soldier fly larvae at the Enterra Feed Corporation in Langley, British Columbia, Canada, March 14, 2018.

Black soldier fly larvae also contain high levels of calcium and iron and can feed on a broad array of food waste.  </P><P>Crickets - a favorite for human consumption in some countries - are by contrast picky eaters. They’re also noisy, and can damage nearby crops if they escape. </P><P>Enterra is expanding to a second commercial-scale plant in Calgary within the next year and targeting opening similar facilities in other North American cities every year for the next five years, with financing from Calgary-based Avrio Capital and UK-based Wheat Sheaf. </P><P>Protix opened its first commercial black soldier fly larvae plant in the Netherlands in 2017 and will break ground on a second facility there later this year, aided by a $50 million investment from Buhler. The Dutch company, working with fish farmers, has also launched a brand of “friendly salmon,” fed with rations containing insect meal instead of fishmeal. </P><P>“If we are able to be successful in Europe, then this will be a global solution,” said Protix CEO Kees Aarts. </P><P>    Neither company would disclose the production costs or capacity, citing proprietary technology. But both said their insect feed prices are on par with to slightly above competing feeds like fishmeal. </P><P>Ohio-based EnviroFlight, a black soldier fly larvae producer, will break ground on the first commercial-scale insect meal production facility in the United States near Cincinnati later this year. </P><H3>    REGULATORY HURDLES </H3><P>    Humans have been eating insects for centuries, but the practice is not common in many western cultures and still spooks food regulators. </P><P>Black soldier fly larvae production has gained a handful of approvals in Europe, Canada and the United States, mostly for use in fish farms. Poultry, swine and pet food regulations are not as far along. </P><P>    “Since fish eat insects in the wild naturally, it is easier for consumers to wrap their heads around insects as part of the feed,” Cargill’s Anquetil said. </P><P>    Thorough safety testing of insects as feed will be critical for consumer acceptance, said Thomas Gremillion, director for the Food Policy Institute at the Consumer Federation of America. </P><P>“If there was a big change in how animals are being fed, I’d want to see some extra scrutiny of whether the animals were accumulating any kinds of toxins from the insects,” he said. </P><P>It will take years for the insect farming sector to scale up. But growing the business to even a small market share would make a big difference to the feed industry and the environment, said Robert Nathan Allen, an insect farmer and chairman of the North American Coalition for Insect Agriculture.  </P><DIV class=""inline-container_1QqKC mega_19SOz""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption_2BUXy"">Slideshow<SPAN class=""count_3OPtf""> (8 Images)</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></DIV><P>“If we’re replacing 5 or 10 percent of the proteins that are normally in those feeds with insect protein,” Allen said, “That’s a lot of resources saved.”</P><DIV class=""container_28wm1""><DIV class=""attribution_o4ojT""><P class=""content_27_rw"">Reporting by Karl Plume in Chicago; Additional reporting by Ben Nelms in Langley, British Columbia; Editing by Simon Webb and Brian Thevenot</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Businesses who commit have two years to develop science-based targets, which are then closely reviewed by the initiative’s team of experts. Only targets that meet strict criteria are approved. Importantly, companies setting science-based targets must seek to not only reduce emissions in their own operations, but also within their value chains, which can move entire industries toward more efficient and greener supply chains.

In recent years, the Kochs have played an increasingly public role as financial angels for conservative causes, politicians and foundations</P><P>What’s not so well-known is the activity of Koch Industries in the trenches in Washington, where a Center for Public Integrity examination of lobbying disclosure files and federal regulatory records reveals a lobbying steamroller for the company’s interests, at times in conflict with its public pose.</P><P>The money that Koch (pronounced “coke”) has spent on lobbying in Washington has soared in recent years, from $857,000 in 2004 to $20 million in 2008. The Kochs then spent another $20.5 million over the next two years to influence federal policy, as the company’s lobbyists and officials sought to mold, gut or kill more than 100 prospective bills or regulations.</P><P>Oil is the core of the Koch business empire, and the company’s lobbyists and officials have successfully fought to preserve the industry’s tax breaks and credits, and to defeat attempts by Congress to regulate greenhouse gases.</P><P>But Koch’s diversified interests, and thus its lobbying activities, extend far beyond petroleum. Koch companies trade <mark>carbon</mark> emission credits in Europe and derivatives in the U.S. They make jet fuel in Alaska from North Slope oil, and gasoline in Minnesota from the oil sands of Canada. They raise cattle in Montana and manufacture spandex in China, ethanol in Iowa, fertilizer in Trinidad, nylon in Holland, napkins in France and toilet paper in Wisconsin.</P><P>According to the most recent <EM>Forbes </EM>magazine rankings, Koch had $100 billion in revenues in 2009 — on a par with corporate giants like IBM or Verizon — and stood a close second to <mark>Cargill Inc</mark>. on the list of the largest private US companies. The firm has 70,000 employees, and a presence in 60 countries and almost every state.</P><P>Koch’s decision to pour millions into lobbying Washington has put them high on the list of corporations whose lobbyists work the corridors of the nation’s capital. Last year, Koch Industries ranked in the top five — roughly on a par with BP and Royal Dutch Shell — in lobbying expenses among oil and gas companies, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</P><P>These totals do not include the work of the trade associations that Koch uses to represent its interests in Washington. There’s a major  industry group called  the National Petrochemical &amp; Refiners Association, and obscure organizations like the green-sounding National Environmental Development Association’s Clean Air Project, whose membership lists Koch and two of its subsidiaries (Georgia-Pacific and Invista) with a dozen industrial giants like ExxonMobil Corp., General Electric Co. and Alcoa Inc.</P><P>Koch’s lobbyists are known on Capitol Hill for maintaining a low profile. There are no former U.S. senators or House committee chairmen on the payroll. The firm had 30 registered lobbyists in 2010, many of whom are Washington insiders with previous experience as congressional staffers or federal agency employees.</P><P>Gregory Zerzan is a good example. Zerzan was a senior counsel for the House Financial Services Committee before serving as an acting assistant secretary and deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. Treasury Department during the George W. Bush administration. Zerzan then worked as counsel and head of global public policy for the International Swaps and Derivative Association before joining Koch Industries as a lobbyist.</P><P>Koch clout is augmented by campaign donations to parties and candidates for federal office — $11 million in the last two decades, according to the <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Koch+Industries&amp;year=2010"">Center for Responsive Politics</A> — and generous gifts from three family foundations to universities and conservative organizations and interest groups.</P><P>According to IRS records, the Koch foundations are essential donors (having given $3.4 million from 2007 through 2009) to the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, a nonprofit known for its support of the Tea Party movement. Among the organizations that have each received a million dollars or more over the last five years from Koch foundations are the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and two conservative think tanks at George Mason University in Virginia: the Institute for Humane Studies and the Mercatus Center.</P><P>The Kochs primarily donate to conservative candidates and causes but have given more than $1 million in the last decade to the liberal Brookings Institution. And among politicians they supported last year was Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat elected governor of New York with $87,000 from the Koch family.</P><P>The emergence of “the Koch web — political action, campaign giving, funding of groups engaged in political action and campaigns, conferences to expand political and policy influence — is a striking phenomenon,” said Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.</P><P>The Center asked Koch Industries and its lobbyists in Washington, in a dozen emails and telephone calls over more than two weeks, to comment on the firm’s lobbying efforts. Koch’s representatives declined the opportunity.</P><P>But in a March 1 column in <A href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704288304576170974226083178.html""><EM>The Wall Street Journal</EM></A>, Charles Koch defended his and his company’s practices. “As a matter of principle our company has been outspoken in defense of economic freedom,” Koch wrote. “This country would be better off if every company would do the same. Instead, we see far too many businesses that paint their tails white and run with the antelope.”</P><H4>Ethanol</H4><P>The Koch brothers are renowned as free market libertarians. But as a major trader in energy and financial markets, Koch Industries also knows how to hedge.</P><P>As its corporate officials and  publicists decried ethanol as a costly government boondoggle, the Kochs bought four ethanol plants in Iowa in recent months, with a combined annual capacity of 435 million gallons. In Washington (where ethanol tax subsidies cost the Treasury some $6 billion annually) Koch representatives lobbied Congress on ethanol and other biofuel subsidies.</P><P> “New or emerging markets, such as renewable fuels, are an opportunity for us to create value within the rules the government sets,” Flint Hills Resources President Brad Razook told his employees in the January company newsletter.</P><P>Koch Industries’ status as an ethanol player goes beyond its new Iowa plants. Koch blends ethanol and gasoline nearby, in its Minnesota refinery. By its own account, the company’s subsidiaries, Flint Hills and Koch Supply &amp; Trading, currently buy and market about one-tenth of all the ethanol produced in the United States.</P><P>The Kochs seem to have recognized that their actions might seem hypocritical and in a January 2011 newsletter the company tried to explain things to employees who have been “scratching their heads and wondering: what is going on?”</P><P>“After all, ethanol production is heavily subsidized, mandated and protected,” Koch Industries acknowledged, “while Koch companies openly oppose such government programs.”</P><P>Realism had won out. The company has the “capabilities necessary to be successful in the ethanol industry,” the newsletter explained. The new ethanol plants “fit well geographically with several other FHR assets, including fuel … terminals, a widespread distribution network that includes Iowa, and the Pine Bend [Minnesota] refinery.”</P><P>“We are not going to place our company and our employees at a competitive disadvantage by not participating in programs that are available to our competitors,” Razook assured Koch employees.</P><P>The company has a history of pragmatism in commercial affairs. Koch was a pioneer importer of Russian oil to the United States, including a 2002 shipment of Russian crude that Koch sold to the U.S. government to help fill the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And though it opposes a cap-and-trade solution to global warming for the United States, Koch makes money trading emissions credits under a similar program in Europe.</P><P>Nor is ethanol the only form of corporate welfare Koch Industries supports. As it ventures into biofuel production, and uses alternative fuels to power its plants, the company has its lobbyists working “to expand the [tax] credit for renewable electricity production” made from biomass.</P><P>Georgia-Pacific, the company reported in 2008, was responsible for more than 10 percent of all the renewable biomass electricity generated in the U.S.</P><H4>Toxic</H4><P>Koch’s efforts to limit regulation of toxic substances illustrate the breadth of its lobbying operation.</P><P>In 2004 Koch Industries purchased Invista, a subsidiary of DuPont, known for manufacturing Lycra, Stainmaster carpets and other textiles and fabrics. In 2005, as part of the same corporate diversification and expansion strategy, Koch Industries bought the giant wood and paper products firm, Georgia-Pacific, adding Brawny paper towels, Angel Soft toilet paper, Dixie cups and dozens of factories and plants to its holdings.</P><P>Koch has since worked, on Capitol Hill and in various regulatory proceedings, to dilute or halt tighter federal regulation of several toxic byproducts that could affect its bottom line, including dioxin, asbestos and formaldehyde, all of which have been linked to cancer.</P><P>Dioxin is released from incinerators, hazardous waste treatment, pesticide manufacturing, paper plants and other sources. With 165 manufacturing facilities across the United States, Georgia-Pacific “has a significant interest in and will be significantly impacted,” by the EPA’s decisions on dioxin, Koch officials told the agency in April 2010.</P><P>Hundreds of workers would have to be hired, and trucks and earth-moving equipment leased or purchased. And “of the limited number of hazardous waste landfills operating in the United States, very few are willing to accept dioxin-containing soil,” the company noted.</P><P> “Treatment and disposal of dioxin-containing soil is already a challenging, expensive and capacity-limited problem that would only get worse if additional volumes were generated.”</P><P>It’s been three decades since the environmental catastrophes at Love Canal, N.Y., and Times Beach, Mo., introduced the American public to the dangers of dioxin. But in the EPA hearing at the Washington Hilton last July, toxicologist John M. DeSesso, a consultant speaking on behalf of Georgia-Pacific, told the agency that the scientific studies on common levels of exposure are still inconclusive. He urged further study.</P><P>The Environmental Working Group and a number of public health organizations, meanwhile, chastised the EPA for dragging its feet, and reminded the agency panel that another arm of the federal government, the U.S. National Toxicology Program, and the World Health Organization have already classified dioxin as a known human carcinogen.</P><P>“Twenty-five years after publishing its first assessment of dioxin … the EPA has yet to establish a safe daily dose for human exposure” for “one of the most-studied of all chemical pollutants,” the EWG told the panel. “It is EPA’s responsibility to address this problem with resolve … without regard to pressure from special interests who stand to benefit financially from weak standards and regulations.”</P><P>It isn’t just dioxin that has drawn Koch’s interest. On Capitol Hill, and in regulatory proceedings, Koch lobbyists and officials have resisted tighter government regulation of a gallery of toxic and carcinogenic substances, like asbestos, formaldehyde and benzene.</P><P>“GP strongly disagrees with the [National Toxicology Program] panel’s conclusion to list formaldehyde, a natural component of every cell in the body, as a human carcinogen,” wrote Traylor Champion, the firm’s vice president for environmental affairs, in a February 2010 letter.</P><P> “Costly control requirements are being mandated on sources that have insignificant levels of HAP (hazardous air pollutants) emissions,” a Georgia-Pacific environmental health and safety manager, James Eckenrode, complained to the EPA in November 2008, when it sought to apply tougher air <mark>pollution</mark> standards on the firm’s manufacture of resins and formaldehyde.</P><P>Through its Flint Hills Resources subsidiary, Koch Industries operates a refinery near Fairbanks, Alaska. “Refineries in Alaska are geographically isolated from the rest of the U.S. market such that benzene extraction and sale into the petrochemical market would be infeasible,” the company argued in 2006, when the EPA proposed new clean air limits on benzene. “Benzene reductions to levels proposed in this rule would either require extensive and economically prohibitive capital upgrades at our facility or would result in a significant reduction in gasoline production.”</P><P>When Koch Industries purchased Georgia-Pacific, it inherited a titanic liability regarding asbestos. Georgia-Pacific had used asbestos to make gypsum-based drywall products, and starting in the 1980s the firm became a target for more than 340,000 claims by plaintiffs who said they suffered lung and other diseases, including mesothelioma, a deadly cancer. By 2005, the company was spending $200 million a year and had to build a $1.5 billion reserve fund for asbestos liabilities and defense costs.</P><P>In a 2008 Koch Industries publication, General Counsel Mark Holden griped that “many of those claims are an outright abuse of the legal system … that often involve people who are not sick … all because of over-zealous litigators and a legal system that gives them perverse incentives.”</P><P>The number of new claims has dropped with tougher federal safety standards. But in the 110<SUP>th</SUP> Congress Koch lobbyists still sought to sway members on legislative proposals intending to restrict the use of asbestos and improve public knowledge, even Senate Resolution 462, which called for a “National Asbestos Awareness Week.”</P><H4>Global warming and low <mark>carbon</mark> fuel standards</H4><P>It’s in the Kochs’ commercial interest to preserve America’s reliance on <mark>carbon</mark>-based energy sources. Despite recent diversification, Koch remains a major petrochemical company with refineries in North Pole, Alaska; Corpus Christi, Texas; Rosemount, Minn., and Rotterdam in the Netherlands; an array of chemical plants; a coal subsidiary (the C. Reiss Coal Co.) and 4,000 miles of pipelines.</P><P>So it is not surprising that, when the Obama administration and the Democrats on Capitol Hill proposed to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases in recent years, Koch Industries responded with a fervent counteroffensive.</P><P>“Oppose government mandates on <mark>carbon</mark> reduction provisions … [and] provisions related to <mark>climate change</mark>, and oppose entire bill,” Koch lobbyist Robert P. Hall wrote, listing his goals on the 2008 lobbying disclosure form.</P><P>The firm’s lobbying expenditures soared in 2008 as Koch Industries and its subsidiaries — Georgia-Pacific, Invista, Flint Hills Resources, Koch <mark>Carbon</mark>, Koch Nitrogen — peppered the EPA and members of Congress with objections. Several worked on measures that would strip the EPA of the power to regulate greenhouse gases through the Clean Air Act.</P><P>Koch-supported groups like the National Environmental Development Association’s Clean Air Project joined the effort. In a recent meeting, five Koch representatives joined colleagues from ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Eli Lilly and other NEDA-CAP members to register concerns with EPA officials over the proposed mandatory reporting rule for greenhouse gas emissions, the record shows.</P><P>Koch’s lobbying efforts on <mark>climate change</mark> are matched by a public campaign. Via three foundations — the Claude R. Lambe Foundation, the Charles G. Koch Foundation and the David H. Koch Foundation — funded and administered by Koch family members and employees, the Kochs have donated several million dollars in recent years to think tanks and groups that have sought to discredit <mark>climate</mark> science and EPA’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gases.</P><P> “Why are such unproven or false claims promoted?” the Koch Industries company newsletter, <EM>Discovery</EM>, asked in an article on global warming entitled, “Blowing Smoke.”</P><P>“Scientists have … perverted the peer review process, doing everything possible to prevent opinions contrary to the alarmist view from being heard,” the article said. Humans should adapt to global warming, not try to slow or stop it, the newsletter recommended. “Since we can’t control Mother Nature, let’s figure out how to get along with her changes.”</P><P>In early March, members of the Republican-led House Energy and Commerce Committee — many of whom had received campaign contributions from Koch employees and PACs last fall — voted to bar the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. Their action has been endorsed by Speaker John Boehner and Republican House leaders.</P><P>Of particular concern to Koch lobbyists in Washington, according to their disclosure forms, are measures to encourage or require the use of low-<mark>carbon</mark> fuels. These sources of energy, in their manufacture and use, contribute less than other fuels to global warming.</P><P>The Koch refinery in Minnesota is designed to process heavy “high-<mark>carbon</mark>” Canadian crude oil, and is fed by a pipeline from Canada. Koch “is among Canada’s largest crude oil purchasers, shippers and exporters,” the company says, with a trading and supply office in Calgary and a terminal in Hardisty, Alberta. Much of the oil comes from the mining of oil sands, which have a particularly heavy <mark>carbon</mark> footprint because the process releases greenhouse gases from peat lands and boreal forest, and requires a great deal of energy to heat and sweat the oil out.</P><P>“Canadian crude generates more greenhouse gas emissions” and so low-<mark>carbon</mark> standards “would cripple refiners that rely on heavy crude feedstocks,” the Koch Industries website notes. “It would be particularly devastating for refiners that use heavy Canadian crude.”</P><P>When lawmakers in Washington and states like California sought to address global warming by requiring the use of low <mark>carbon</mark> fuels, Koch Industries responded. Koch lobbyists listed the legislation as a lobbying priority on Capitol Hill. And in California, where a wide-ranging series of measures to slow <mark>climate change</mark> were launched by former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Koch joined the fight to defeat them.</P><P>A Koch subsidiary, Flint Hills Resources, donated a million dollars in support of Proposition 23, an unsuccessful attempt funded by Koch and other energy companies last year to stall implementation of the low-<mark>carbon</mark> standards and other remedial <mark>climate</mark> measures in California.</P><H4>Energy industry tax breaks</H4><P>Koch lobbyists spend much of their time, according to their disclosure reports, fighting attempts by members of Congress to curb price-gouging, windfall profit-taking and speculation in the oil industry. To this same end, Koch officials worked to dilute a 2009 Federal Trade Commission rule governing manipulation of the energy markets.</P><P>Meanwhile, Koch has lobbied to preserve some of the oil industry’s coveted tax breaks and credits.</P><P>One benefit is known as the Section 199 deduction, approved by Congress several years ago to help the hard-pressed U.S. manufacturing sector. In light of the oil and gas industry’s hearty profits, the Obama administration and members of Congress have sought to end the Section 199 subsidy for energy firms and save the U.S. Treasury $14 billion over 10 years. But Koch lobbyists and trade associations have worked to preserve the deduction.</P><P>Another industry tax break that drew the support of Koch representatives is the venerable “LIFO” (last-in, first-out) accounting rule. It allows energy companies effectively to raise the value of their existing inventory (and thus pay lower taxes on profits from sales) when the price of oil soars.</P><P>Under LIFO, the oil in a company’s inventory, no matter what it actually cost, is valued at the cost of the last-acquired (usually highest-cost) barrel. The LIFO rule has been a target in recent years for both Democrats and Republicans in Washington, who would like to raise revenue without raising taxes.</P><H4>Bush tax cuts</H4><P>Koch lobbyists listed the expiring Bush tax cuts as a lobbying objective last year, and the Koch brothers were among an elite, relatively few Americans who profited when the income tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000 a year were extended in a year-end deal.</P><P>Another of the Bush tax breaks had special meaning for the Koch brothers. Charles Koch, 75, and David Koch, 70, are tied for fifth place, each with a net worth of $21.5 billion, in the latest <EM>Forbes</EM> rankings of the wealthiest Americans. Included in the deal to extend the Bush tax cuts was a proposal to reduce the federal estate tax. The Kochs have, historically, been players in an ongoing effort by wealthy families to curb or eliminate the tax on inheritances.</P><P>The final tax deal reached by the White House and Republicans in Congress in December set the estate tax at 35 percent. That makes the new rate considerably more favorable than during the Clinton (55 percent) or even the Bush (45 percent) years, and the lowest it’s been since the 1930s. If one of the patriarchs should die while the new rate is in effect, it would save the Koch family billions of dollars.</P><H4>Terrorism and national security</H4><P>Another major preoccupation of Koch Industries lobbyists during recent sessions of Congress was the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, a federal effort to identify and regulate chemical facilities that could be vulnerable to terrorist attacks.</P><P>In 2009, the House passed legislation that would toughen the standards, and require manufacturers like Koch to use safer chemicals and processes to add another level of protection and minimize the effects of toxic releases from terrorist attacks or catastrophic accidents.</P><P>Koch opposed the changes, claiming they “increase cost and regulatory burden while shifting focus away from security and toward environmental considerations.” The chemical security provisions were listed as lobbying targets by Koch representatives in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.</P><P>According to EPA records, Koch has four facilities that use chlorine dioxide—in Palatka, Fla.; Zachary, La.; New Augusta, Miss.; and Camas, Wash. It has an Invista plant that uses formaldehyde in LaPorte, Texas. Its Flint Hills refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, uses hydrofluoric acid in refining gasoline.  </P><P>Mandatory use of safer technology would “result in even more job losses and higher consumer prices as American manufacturers struggle to comply,” Koch contends in a statement on the chemical safety standards on its website. The House legislation would “restructure, and likely add additional cost to security programs currently in place for Koch companies’ facilities.”</P><H4>Financial regulation</H4><P>Koch pulls no punches when assigning the blame for the great financial meltdown of 2008: It was the government’s fault, not the markets.</P><P>“Almost all of these problems (and much of the current chaos) are, at their root, the result of political failure,” said Steve Feilmeier, the chief financial officer for Koch Industries, at the height of the crash.</P><P>It is not surprising, then, that Koch Industries — a major player in international trading markets — resisted increased regulation and spent heavily on lobbyists who worked to shape the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and other vehicles for financial reform. The Koch lobbyists focused, in particular, on provisions aimed at regulating systemic risk in the financial markets, and the use of derivatives.</P><P>Koch Industries started out trading crude oil more than four decades ago, but its trading group has since branched into commodities, derivatives and other risk management products.</P><P>In that time, the market for trading derivatives and swaps in the energy industry has gone largely unregulated. And in past Congresses, Koch lobbyists labored to preserve the exemption, known as the “Enron Loophole,” that excused energy commodity contracts from regulation.</P><P>But the Dodd-Frank law gave the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission the authority to craft new rules to subject traders in the energy industry to increased regulation and transparency, capital and margin requirements, and supervision by a derivatives clearing house. Koch lobbyists worked to favorably shape the bill, and have not stopped working since it was passed.</P><P>Within a few weeks after President Obama signed the legislation, Koch lobbyist Gregory Zerzan had secured a coveted meeting with SEC Commissioner Troy Paredes, a Bush appointee, and his counsel, Gena Lai, to discuss how the government would implement the law.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""container""><DIV class=""calais-tags-wrapper""><H4>More stories about</H4></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The system was put into regular shipping use for the first time in 2008, when one of the kites was attached to the 132-meter (433-foot) multi purpose heavy lift carrier <A href=""https://newatlas.com/maiden-voyage-for-skysails-towing-kite-system/8693/"" target=""_blank""><EM>MS Beluga SkySails</EM></A>. Now, Cargill Ocean Transportation has announced that it plans to use the technology on one of its long-term charter ships, a vessel of between 25,000 and 30,000 deadweight tonnes (27,558 to 33,069 US tons). It will be the largest kite-assisted ship in the world.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><DIV class=""ArticleBody__html""><P>The kite will measure 320 square meters (382.7 square yards), and will fly ahead of the ship in a figure-8 pattern at a height of 100 to 420 meters (328 to 1,378 feet). Its flight path will be controlled by an automated system, and the kite itself will be launched and retrieved via a winch-equipped telescoping tower on the bow – definitely a better approach than having someone desperately bracing themselves against the deck of the ship, while clutching a couple of control lines! Information regarding the system's operation will be displayed on a monitor on the ship's bridge, although it is said to require a minimum of input from the crew.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""ArticleBody__html""><P>Use of a SkySails sysytem is claimed to reduce a cargo vessel's fuel consumption by an average of 10 to 35 percent annually, and by up to 50 percent temporarily. Due to its &quot;dynamic flight maneuvers,&quot; the kite reportedly generates 5 to 25 times more power per square meter sail area than a conventional sail. A study by the United Nations' International Maritime Organization suggested that up to 100 million tonnes (110.2 million US tons) of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide could be saved each year, if the technology was broadly applied to the world's merchant fleet.</P></DIV><DIV class=""ArticleBody__html""><P><A href=""http://www.cargill-ot.com/"" target=""_blank"">Cargill</A> plans to install the <A href=""http://www.skysails.info/english/"" target=""_blank"">SkySails</A> system this December, and hopes to have it fully operational within the first quarter of 2012.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It was a solution that provided enough added value for our customers – it’s always difficult to persuade people they should be paying more, but now they are getting something in return it’s easier to make the case”, says Taco.</P><P>“At the same time, farmers and farmer organizations can be incentivized through premiums and other direct benefits. In a complex value chain like cocoa, based on many smallholder farmers, the independent verification element that certification brings is essential.”</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Certification allows us in partnership to address issues in our value chain, and show our capabilities beyond just generating a nice product.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Taco also believes that certification has been helpful in bringing issues such as <A href=""https://www.utz.org/what-we-offer/sector-change/child-labor/"" target=""_blank"">child labor</A> and <A href=""https://www.utz.org/what-we-offer/sector-change/<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" target=""_blank""><mark>climate change</mark></A> to the fore, and the association has helped Cargill demonstrate their commitment to working on these issues.</P><P>“Although initially over promising on the speed we could address the issues, I think certification is one of the tools that, in combination with other interventions, will contributes to the <A href=""https://www.utz.org/better-business-hub/marketing-<mark>sustainable</mark>-products/does-the-utz-label-guarantee-a-child-labor-free-product/"" target=""_blank"">eradication of child labor</A>,” he says.</P><H2>Embedding certification is key</H2><P>As with many changes rolled out across large companies, certification hasn’t come without its challenges.</P><P>“The biggest challenge was to prove that this actually works, to prove that <A title=""Do farmers really benefit from joining UTZ?"" href=""https://www.utz.org/better-business-hub/strengthening-your-reputation/farmers-really-benefit-joining-utz/"" target=""_blank"">certification makes an impact at farm level</A>, but also that it works at an organizational level,” explains Taco. “Also, how to integrate certification into your organization is not defined by anyone, you have to work out how you do that individually. Certification comes with certain requirements that could be seen as a burden for an organization, so from a business perspective you need to be sure that that extra work brings a reward somewhere else, for all.”</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>How to integrate certification into your organization is not defined by anyone, you have to work out how you do that individually.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The company’s early approach was to communicate certification clearly to all employees. Later, the focus moved to the embedding process because, “sustainability means different things for different departments – the sales team understand it differently to finance, for example. So embedding it organizationally was key.”</P><P>Certification has become an essential tool for Cargill, now forming the basis of the company’s <A href=""http://www.cargillcocoachocolate.com/sustainability/cargill-cocoa-promise/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">Cocoa Promise</A>.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Certification, with its strong focus on training and standards, is essential groundwork that we use as building blocks for the Cocoa Promise.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><DIV id=""attachment_10985"" style=""width: 418px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Leaflet on Cargill’s sustainability program Cocoa Promise</P></DIV><P>“The Cocoa Promise is our overarching approach to sustainability and sourcing,” says Taco. “We believe that by applying a sequential approach we can drive change to create thriving communities. Certification, with its strong focus on training and standards, is essential groundwork that we use as building blocks for the Cocoa Promise.”</P><H2>Industry demands transparency</H2><P>Looking more widely, Taco believes that the main trend in the cocoa industry right now is a demand for transparency.</P><P>“This is all about ‘show me the results of your investments, share your failures, and let’s see what we can do about this together’,” he says. “I think this is big, and it’s also very much about who is going to do what. As a company we can do certain things because we have a role in the supply chain, and we can do different things from governments and NGOs. So defining these roles will determine success.”</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>As a company we can do certain things because we have a role in the supply chain, and we can do different things from governments and NGOs.
