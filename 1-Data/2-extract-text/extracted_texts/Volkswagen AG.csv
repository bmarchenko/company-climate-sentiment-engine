Both particulate matter and NOx have <mark>climate change</mark> impacts. NOx dissipates faster than <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide but helps create tropospheric ozone, a more potent greenhouse gas.</P><P>EPA named five types of four-cylinder diesels—the Audi A3, Beetle, Golf, Jetta and Passat, all of which have the same engine—in its notice.</P><P>EPA did not issue a recall and said the cars remain safe and legal to drive and also legal to sell. Fixing the cars’ emission systems will be incumbent upon Volkswagen, the agency said.</P><P>Volkswagen violated the Clean Air Act, officials said, under which the penalty could reach $37,500 per car, or slightly more than $18 billion, a figure a U.S. EPA official said is accurate.</P><P>The German automaker, the largest worldwide by sales, concealed vital information from the U.S. federal government, the public and the California Air Resources Board (ARB), said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for U.S. EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. Investigations by EPA and ARB are underway.</P><P>“These violations are very serious. We expected better from VW,” Giles said.</P><P>“Our goal now is to ensure that the affected cars are brought into compliance, to dig more deeply into the extent and implications of Volkswagen’s efforts to cheat on clean air rules,” said Richard Corey, executive officer of ARB, in a statement.</P><P><STRONG>Earlier, VW admitted its vehicles contained software being questioned</STRONG>
Volkswagen admitted earlier this month that the vehicles contained defeat devices.</P><P>Volkswagen “manufactured and installed” sophisticated software, known under federal law as “defeat devices,” which can be programmed to detect when vehicles are being tested to meet emission requirements, officials said.</P><P>“[The device] senses whether the vehicle is being tested or not based on various inputs including the position of the steering wheel, vehicle speed, the duration of the engine’s operation and barometric pressure,” the violation notice reads. “These inputs precisely track the parameters of the federal test procedure” used for EPA certification, it reads.</P><P>Two years ago, met with puzzling results from on-road and in-the-lab vehicle tests, examiners did the research and asked questions that would ultimately trigger Friday’s announcement.</P><P>The International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit research group, had commissioned West Virginia University researchers to test three European diesels—a Jetta, a Passat and a BMW X5—and study NOx emissions and other pollutants under real-world scenarios.</P><P>Tested on a dynamometer—a large treadmill-type platform for cars, sometimes called a “rolling road,” that measures for torque, power and other vehicle metrics—the VWs passed. Yet under real-world conditions, testers drove the cars equipped with emissions-tracking sensors between Southern California and Seattle, and the VWs spewed far more from their tailpipes than legally allowed.</P><P>The Jetta’s emissions were 15 to 35 times higher than acceptable. For the Passat, they were five to 20 times higher, while the BMW averaged levels either at or below the legal threshold.</P><P>“This inconsistency was a major factor in ICCT’s decision to contact CARB and EPA about our test results,” ICCT said Friday.</P><P><STRONG>Trail of evidence started in Europe</STRONG>“Ironically, the reason we tested these vehicles is that we were finding high vehicle emissions from light-duty cars in Europe,” said Drew Kodjak, ICCT’s executive director, in an interview.</P><P>The team’s hypothesis was that the European emissions tests were flimsier than U.S. tests, he said.</P><P>“The vehicle was programmed to ‘switch,’ as the EPA says, from low emissions to high efficiency,” Kodjak said. Asked what automakers have to gain from installing so-called defeat devices, experts said they can save the company money on warranty claims, make the vehicle more fun to drive and, likely ironic to some, improve fuel economy.</P><P>“It’s a performance boost. It’s fuel savings,” Kodjak said, explaining that as cars have gotten more advanced, the industry has increasingly relied on software patches and digital code to update its models.</P><P>Daniel Carder, now the interim director of the Center for Alternative Fuels, Engines and Emissions at West Virginia University, worked on the WVU <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/assets/2015/09/21/document_cw_02.pdf"" target=""_blank"">report</A>, which the team published in May of 2014.</P><P>If automakers have software algorithms or updates that don’t meet federal code, they can negotiate with EPA, Carder said in an interview. And both parties hash out approval of “auxiliary emission control devices,” like the ones VW used, he said.</P><P>“That’s all confidential information,” Carder said.</P><P>Petrolheads worldwide purchase and then erase or modify computer chips in their vehicles’ computers, called electronic control units, or ECUs, to get better performance, efficiency and fuel savings. Online, these chips are available for a few hundred dollars.</P><P>“It’s like a tremendous number of people that do this,” said John Storey, an automotive and emissions expert at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, putting the figure of “chipped” models between 40 and 60 percent of all diesel pickup trucks in the United States. One byproduct of all this tampering: higher emissions of gases like NOx. “These are completely illegal, but no one ever gets caught,” he said.</P><P><STRONG>Congressman wants EPA to consider ‘severe action’</STRONG>“If Volkswagen willfully sought to evade the Clean Air Act and fraudulently sold cars to millions of consumers with this technology, EPA should pursue the most severe action possible to deter others from doing the same,” Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement.</P><P>“Such deceitful actions violated the law and misled consumers, while other law abiding companies were disadvantaged and the public health was put at risk,” he said. “We must ensure that this does not happen again and that consumers can trust the products that they buy.”</P><P>Yet similar violations have happened before.</P><P>The Justice Department and EPA <A href=""http://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/1998/October/499_enr.htm"" target=""_blank"">settled</A> with seven heavy-duty diesel engine companies in 1998 for more than a billion dollars over remarkably similar charges: The manufacturers had installed defeat devices in software packages, which let the trucks pass federal tests but led to up to three times the legal limit of NOx gases when driven on the highway.</P><P>Dynamometer tests are flawed in part because the conditions they put a car under can be easy to predict and, in turn, beat.</P><P>“Well, we hope they’re not common,” said Kodjak of the ICCT, referring to defeat devices. “You run a risk of getting caught, and the penalties are severe,” he said, noting the heavy-duty truck settlement in 1998. “But it is true that unless there is random testing of vehicles, you know, you might, you might not get caught,” he said.</P><P>Don Anair, research and deputy director of the Clean Vehicles Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said holding car companies to the same standard is vital.</P><P>“It appears they did this with the intent of clearly making the emissions performance different on the test cycle, which I think is the most surprising,” Anair said in an interview. “Testing in real-world situations is critical,” he said, to confirm that car companies are operating on a “level playing field.”</P><P>The diesel share of the U.S. auto market is slightly less than 1 percent of all car sales in 2014. But a large portion of the diesels are VW-made, which means diesel vehicles could be responsible for between 10 and 25 percent of all NOx emissions from light-duty cars last year, according to Dave Cooke, a vehicle analyst at UCS.</P><P><STRONG>CEO of VW orders external investigation</STRONG>
Martin Winterkorn, CEO of Volkswagen, said the company takes seriously these allegation of “manipulations that violate American environmental standards.” The company ordered an external investigation into the matter and will cooperate fully to “openly and completely establish all of the facts of this case,” he said.</P><P>“I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public,” Winterkorn said in a <A href=""http://media.vw.com/release/1066/"" target=""_blank"">statement</A>. “The trust of our customers and the public is and continues to be our most important asset. We at Volkswagen will do everything that must be done in order to re-establish the trust that so many people have placed in us, and we will do everything necessary in order to reverse the damage this has caused.”</P><P>In an email, Luke Tonachel, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s clean vehicles and fuels project, said cars emit up to 30 percent of the NOx and volatile organic compounds in areas that fail ambient air quality standards, releasing smog and soot skyward. “It’s very disturbing to learn that VW is flouting those standards,” he said.</P><P>“Why would they think they’d get away with it?” asked Storey, the Oak Ridge scientist, noting the use of the defeat devices went on for six model years. “It’s ludicrous.”</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>wire with permission from Environment &amp; Energy Publishing, LLC. <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/"" target=""_blank"">www.eenews.net</A>, 202-628-6500</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

According to the <EM>New York Times</EM>, Volkswagen Group <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/19/business/volkswagen-is-ordered-to-recall-nearly-500000-vehicles-over-emissions-software.html?smid=nytnow-share&amp;smprod=nytnow&amp;_r=0"">will have to recall</A> 500,000 Volkswagens and Audis on which so-called “defeat devices” were installed.</P><P>In a <A href=""http://www3.epa.gov/otaq/cert/documents/vw-nov-caa-09-18-15.pdf"">Notice of Violation</A> (PDF) sent to the automaker, the EPA said that the defeat devices on Volkswagen Group's cars “render inoperative elements of the vehicle's emission control system.” If the car senses that it's operating normally, the defeat device reduces the effectiveness of some or all of the car's emission control components. However, if the car is undergoing an emission test, the emission control systems will be allowed to function normally.</P><P>According to the EPA's letter, the software on Volkswagens and Audis was installed on the cars' electronic control module and determined whether the car was driving normally or undergoing testing “based on various inputs including the position of the steering wheel, vehicle speed, the duration of the engine's operation, and barometric pressure.” If the car was driving under normal conditions, the car's nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions were increased by 10 to 40 times above the level of NOx emissions permitted by the EPA.</P><P>NOx <A href=""http://arstechnica.com/science/2008/03/coupling-nitrous-oxide-reduction-with-the-production-of-useful-industrial-chemicals/"">contributes to <mark>climate change</mark></A> and the destruction of ozone.

The University found that two Volkswagen diesel vehicles—a 2012 Jetta and a 2013 Passat—gave off significantly higher in-use emissions. Volkswagen denied that there was anything wrong with its models' emissions control systems and asserted that there were technical issues with the individual test cars that contributed to the University's results. Still, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the EPA launched investigations.</P><P>VW issued a voluntary recall of affected models at the end of 2014, but CARB and the EPA were not able to find noticeably different results in recalled cars. “It became clear that CARB and the EPA would not approve certificates of conformity for VW's 2016 model year diesel vehicles until VW could adequately explain the anomalous issues and ensure the agencies that the 2016 model year vehicles would not have similar issues,” the EPA wrote. “Only then did VW admit it had designed and installed a defeat device in these vehicles in the form of a sophisticated software algorithm that detected when a vehicle was undergoing emissions testing.”</P><P>The cars that must be recalled include diesel Jettas after 2009, diesel Golfs after 2010, diesel Audi A3s after 2010, diesel Beetle Convertibles after 2012, and diesel Passats after 2012.</P></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""column-wrapper""><DIV class=""left-column""><SECTION class=""article-author""><DIV class=""author-bio""><SECTION class=""author-bio-top""><A href=""/author/megan-geuss"" class=""author-name"">Megan Geuss</A>

		The Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Chapter 488 [AB 32, Núñez/Pavley]), commonly referred to as AB 32, established the goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions statewide to 1990 levels by 2020. Subsequently, SB 32 (Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 [Pavley]) reduced the GHG emission target by an additional 40 percent by 2030.The Air Resources Board (ARB) has developed a wide variety of regulations and programs intended to reduce GHG emissions, including a cap-and-trade program.</P><P>The cap-and-trade program places a “cap” on aggregate GHG emissions from large GHG emitters. The cap declines over time, ultimately arriving at the target emission level in 2030. To implement the cap-and-trade program, ARB allocates a number of <mark>carbon</mark> allowances equal to the cap, and each allowance is essentially a permit to emit one ton of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (or the equivalent amount for other GHGs). The ARB provides some allowances for free, making others available for purchase at quarterly auctions. Entities can also “trade” (buy and sell on the open market) the allowances in order to obtain enough to cover their total emissions for a given period of time.

Agriculture is an emissions-intensive sector; it accounted for less than 1 percent of U.S. production (in real gross value-added terms), but emitted 10 percent of U.S. GHGs in 2014. Energy-related CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission sources—which dominate GHG emissions in most other production sectors—are dwarfed in agriculture by unique crop and livestock emissions of nitrous oxide and methane. Crop and pasture soil management generates the most GHG emissions, due largely to the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers and other nutrients. Enteric fermentation (digestion in ruminant livestock) and manure management ranks second. Agriculture and forestry are unique in providing opportunities for withdrawing <mark>carbon</mark> from the atmosphere through biological sequestration in soil and biomass <mark>carbon</mark> sinks. The <mark>carbon</mark> sinks, which are largely due to land use change from agricultural to forest land (afforestation) and forest management on continuing forest, offset 11.5 percent of total U.S. GHG emissions in 2014 (see <A data-id=""15176"" href=""/topics/natural-resources-environment/<mark>climate</mark>-change/agricultural-production-and-mitigation/"" title=""Agricultural Production and Mitigation"">Agricultural Production and Mitigation</A>).</P><H3>The National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment</H3><P>The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) aims &quot;to assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.&quot; In this role, every four years it produces a National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment (NCA) that surveys and synthesizes the most recent science about <mark>climate change</mark> impacts and adaptation in the United States.

And over the past year, many countries, particularly in the developing world, decided that an especially effective way to reach those targets is through their farms.</P><P><A href=""http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5666e.pdf"">Nearly 80 percent</A> of the countries said they would use agricultural practices to curb <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/<mark>climate</mark>-change"" target=""_blank""><mark>climate change</mark></A>, and more than 90 percent said they would use those practices in addition to changes in forestry and land use linked to farming.</P><P>&quot;2016 has been a very good year for agriculture and <mark>climate</mark>,&quot; said Martin Frick, director of <mark>climate</mark>, energy and tenure at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. &quot;It's become possible to finally discuss the elephant in the room.&quot;</P><P>When <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/21112016/paris-<mark>climate</mark>-change-agreement-cop-22-marrakech-donald-trump"" target=""_blank""><mark>climate</mark> negotiators gathered in Marrakech in November</A> to begin mapping out the process for reaching the Paris goals, groups hosted at least 80 agriculture-focused sessions.</P><P>&quot;Agriculture has really lagged,&quot; said Craig Hanson, director of the food, forests and water program at the World Resources Institute. &quot;Considering it contributes 13 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and 24 percent of net emissions with land-use change, it's surprising it's taken so long...But it's finally happening,&quot; he said.</P><P><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-d3dc987e-65ec-6d48-ff32-58555da8fdc7"">In the U.S., the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, agriculture's role in <mark>climate change</mark></SPAN> has been discussed mostly by advocacy groups. And while the Department of Agriculture has launched programs to increase farmland's capacity to capture <mark>carbon</mark>, those are voluntary. The U.S.'s plans for meeting the Paris goals rely mainly on energy and transportation.</P><P>When the U.N.'s Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> launched its first global <mark>climate</mark> summit in 1992, agriculture hardly even entered the conversation. It wasn't until about a decade ago that research began to show its contribution to global warming, with special attention paid to the ravages of deforestation for agriculture, especially palm oil.</P><P>&quot;The numbers are pretty staggering. Maybe even a third of greenhouse gas emissions come from the land—more than transportation—but that wasn't clear until 10 years ago,&quot; said Seth Shames, who leads policy research for EcoAgriculture Partners, a group focused on hunger, rural poverty and biodiversity. &quot;Those issues started getting discussed in the <mark>climate change</mark> community. The forest people were able to get organized...and there was less political resistance in the <mark>climate</mark> world.&quot;</P><P>In response, the UNFCCC <A href=""http://redd.unfccc.int/"">launched a program</A> that pays developing countries to preserve their <mark>carbon</mark>-absorbing forests, including standards for measuring, reporting and verifying the emissions cuts.</P><P>Similar standards haven't been developed yet for agriculture.</P><P>&quot;Right now, we don't have mechanisms in place to really capitalize on the benefits that agriculture mitigation strategies can provide,&quot; said Ernie Shea, president of Solutions From The Land, a collaboration of agricultural industry and conservation groups. &quot;Forestry's much further ahead on measuring impacts. We're not there yet with agriculture.&quot;</P><P>The conversation around agriculture's role in <mark>climate change</mark> stems from a sea change in negotiations themselves. In 2009, the <mark>climate</mark> summit in Copenhagen fell apart, largely, some believe, because countries bristled at the top-down approach that dictated what countries must do.</P><P>After Copenhagen, negotiators began working instead on a pledge-based approach.</P><P>&quot;The Paris agreement doesn't impose anything on member states, and turns it around and says: What can you bring to the table?&quot; Frick explained. &quot;This fundamental change in logic has had a tremendous impact for agriculture. Agriculture, for every single country, is one of the most sensitive areas—it's an emotional topic.&quot;</P><P>Ultimately, agriculture emerged as ripe for action. It is existentially linked to a country's very survival and increasingly under threat from weather extremes, drought and floods. Agriculture, in other words, has to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>, but also has a huge, unrealized potential to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark>. That can happen through farm practices like soil <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration through cover cropping, or by making existing farmland more productive and efficient.</P><P>&quot;Drought impacts, flooding, higher nighttime temperatures affecting pollination, new weeds, invasive species. There's an awareness in the agriculture community that we're at risk and we're not as resilient as we need to be,&quot; Shea said.</P><P>That risk is driving the discussion. Farm industry leaders and academics formed the North American <mark>Climate</mark> Smart Agriculture Alliance in 2015 to prompt changes in agricultural practices that have <mark>climate</mark> benefits. Shea says the alliance's approach, much like the approach at the international level, is to promote the idea that certain production techniques are not only better for the environment, but also for farm productivity. The alliance's members include the American Farm Bureau Federation, which continues to deny the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;People are turned off by the <mark>climate change</mark> conversation,&quot; Shea said. &quot;Once you get into a conversation about improving productivity, you can get into a conversation about co-benefits.&quot;</P><P>Greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector in developed countries average about 12 percent, compared to 35 percent in developing countries, which makes agriculture a relatively less important solution in industrialized countries. Still, advocates are pushing agricultural interests and regulators in the U.S. to do their part, pointing <A href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.13340/abstract"">to research</A> that says reaching the goals of the Paris agreement will be impossible without agriculture's contribution.</P><P>Educating farmers about the benefits—and using them to meet Paris targets—could provide the best way forward.</P><P>&quot;There's a lot of fatigue with the negativity on <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; said Thomas Driscoll, policy director at the National Farmers Union, the U.S.'s second largest farm group. &quot;Agriculture and <mark>climate change</mark> is exciting because there's a lot that can be done.

This was announced by Matthias Müller, CEO of <mark>Volkswagen AG</mark>, at the Group’s Annual Media Conference in Berlin. The Group currently produces electric vehicles at three locations, and in two years’ time a further nine Group plants are scheduled to be equipped for this purpose.</P><P>To ensure adequate battery capacity, partnerships with battery manufacturers for Europe and China have already been agreed. The contracts already awarded have a total volume of around €20 billion (US$24.7 billion). A supplier decision for North America will be taken shortly.</P><P>
When “Roadmap E” was launched last fall, Volkswagen announced plans to build up to three million electric vehicles annually by 2025 and market 80 new electric Group models. This year, another nine new vehicles, three of which will be purely electric-powered, will be added to the Group’s electric portfolio of eight e-cars and plug-in hybrids.
</P><P>From 2019, there will be a new electric vehicle “virtually every month”, Müller said: “This is how we intend to offer the largest fleet of electric vehicles in the world, across all brands and regions, in just a few years.”</P><P>

Müller emphasized that this did not mean Volkswagen was turning its back on conventional drive systems. Modern diesel drives were part of the solution, not part of the problem, he stressed—also with regard to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><EM>We are making massive investments in the mobility of tomorrow, but without neglecting current technologies and vehicles that will continue to play an important role for decades to come. We are putting almost €20 billion into our conventional vehicle and drive portfolio in 2018, with a total of more than €90 billion [US$111 billion] scheduled over the next five years.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>
A separate Committee chaired by CEO Müller is advancing digitalization in the Group, a key issue for the future. 
</P><P>
The Volkswagen Group says that it has the financial resources for the transformation. In spite of the billions in cash outflows from the diesel crisis, net liquidity at the end of 2017 remained at €22.4 billion (US$27.6 billion]). 
</P><P>
Research and development costs in 2017 were dominated by new models along with the electrification of the vehicle portfolio, a more efficient range of engines and digitalization. At €12.6 (US$15.5) billion, investments in property, plant and equipment in the Automobile Division remained at the previous year’s level. The R&amp;D ratio, total research and development expenditure as a percentage of the Automotive Division’s sales revenue, decreased to 6.7% from 7.3%. Capex/sales revenue was also lowered significantly to 6.4% from 6.9%.

Speaking to my group is Scott Kelly, Timberlands Manager with the <A href=""http://www.conservationfund.org/"" target=""_blank"">Conservation Fund, who manages the forest</A>. (The Nature Conservancy holds a conservation easement on the property.) Kelly is explaining why the fund spent $400,000 replacing the bridge as part of their forest restoration efforts. Sediment had shallowed the creek below, which, when combined with the drought was wreaking havoc with its population of Steelhead trout, and Coho salmon, which are endangered in this area. Kelly and his team have been investing and working on the roads and bridges to dramatically reduce runoff. So far, these efforts have kept of total of 12,000 dump trucks worth of sediment out of the waterways, which has been critical in maintaining the health of this forest.</P><P>The creek, some thirty feet below, is shallow enough to wade in. Not too long ago, the water was nearly up to the bridge. It's been dry here, which doesn't help. Kelly said that if the creek gets too shallow, all the fish will be crowded into pools and the birds will feast on them until they are gone. Alterra Hetzel, the Conservation Fund's Forest Business Development Manager tells the group about some new salmon preservation techniques being tested that involve placing cut logs and branches in the stream to create the types of pools that the salmon like to breed in. They also help to maintain the proper temperature.</P><P>Forests like these may well be our best weapon against <A href=""https://www.environmentalscience.org/history-<mark>climate</mark>-change""><mark>climate change</mark></A>. The absorb <mark>carbon</mark> and protect biodiversity. That is why representatives of Volkswagen and renewable energy and <mark>carbon</mark> offsets provider <A href=""http://www.3degreesinc.com/products/<mark>carbon</mark>-offsets"" target=""_blank"">3Degrees</A> are also here today. We have all driven up from San Francisco in a caravan of high-efficiency Volkswagens. VW is supporting these forest-restoration efforts through <mark>carbon</mark> offsets that they are purchasing from 3Degrees. Other companies such as UPS are also supporting this effort through their <A href=""http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/resources/ship/<mark>carbon</mark>neutral/shipping.html"" target=""_blank""><mark>carbon</mark> neutral</A> shipping program. The money goes towards the funding of forest management activities.</P><P>For VW, this is part of their rollout of a sweeping program that they describe as their holistic approach to <A href=""http://media.vw.com/release/992/"" target=""_blank"">ultra-low <mark>carbon</mark> mobility</A>. That includes not only the launch of their 2015 all-electric eGolf, which gets the equivalent of 116 mpg, but also a number of other initiatives across their supply chain and in their factories. The purchased offsets were calculated to equate to the first 36,000 miles of driving for each eGolf they sell. The company has committed to reducing the <mark>CO2</mark> emissions of their entire fleet by 90% by 2050, well ahead of the ambitious targets that have been set by the EPA.</P><P>Farther down the road, Kelly describes the rationale behind the selective culling of trees, which is gently guiding it back towards the composition of earlier days, when redwoods were the primary species. After the redwoods were cut down, smaller species, such as tanoak (a type of beech), have moved in, part of a natural precession. This forest is being managed, and to some degree commercialized, one of several surprising aspects of this unusual, and one might say, cutting-edge, partnership between, these three entities. In time intervention harvesting will give way to single tree selection. Says Kelly, “This is one of the things we're doing to enhance our forest productivity over the long term.”</P><P>Using a stick in the dirt, Kelly explains how a modeling program called <A href=""http://foresee.fcba.fr/workshop-foresee/"" target=""_blank"">Foresee</A> projects the future growth and yield of the forest, which is used both for planning and as part of the calculation of <mark>carbon</mark> credits. The credits are based on the difference between the amount of timber that would have been harvested under commercial forestry practices and what is actually harvested under the conservation management plan. A PhD student from the University of Montana drives the model. Some years down the road, when these trees get bigger, some of them will be harvested. But not those that were sold for <mark>carbon</mark> credit. Those are committed to remain standing for 100 years.</P><P>The underlying point is that in today's world, the best way to protect the environment from the impacts of economic activity is not always to separate the two. After all, it's all part of the Earth's ecosystem. If we can learn to harvest and utilize natural resources in a <mark>sustainable</mark> manner, it can be a win-win. And if people can come to recognize that their economic interests will best be served in the long run by protecting the natural environment that provides countless services that are taken for granted, all of us will be better off.</P><P>This is one of the operating principles behind the Conservation Fund. If the management of natural lands can provide some level of economic benefit to the surrounding communities, they will be more likely to be protective of those lands. The Garcia River project and two others in Northern California, comprising a total of 73,000 acres, provide for approximately 60 full time jobs. Some of these forests practice <mark>sustainable</mark> silviculture, harvesting timber in a <mark>sustainable</mark> manner, while others, like Garcia River, primarily support themselves through the sale of <mark>carbon</mark> offsets at this point in time.</P><DIV class=""abh_box abh_box_down abh_box_business""><UL class=""abh_tabs""><LI class=""abh_posts""><A href=""#abh_posts"">Latest Posts</A></LI></UL><DIV class=""abh_tab_content""><SECTION class=""vcard abh_about_tab abh_tab"" style=""display:block""><DIV class=""abh_text""><H3 class=""fn name"">RP Siegel</H3><DIV class=""description note abh_description"">RP Siegel has degrees in English and Engineering and a long term interest in the environment.

In spite of the billions in cash outflows from the diesel crisis, net liquidity at the end of 2017 remained at a very solid EUR 22.4 billion.  <I>&quot;The results of the year 2017 demonstrate, we are actively shaping the transformation of our company,&quot;</I> said CFO Frank Witter.  <I>&quot;And we will not cease in our efforts in 2018.&quot;</I></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><SPAN class=""sectionbold"">Key performance indicators for 2017: strong earnings in spite of the diesel issue</SPAN></DIV><DIV>The <A class=""ref ref13"" href=""https://www.idtechex.com/en/timeline/volkswagen/c1547"">Volkswagen Group</A> concluded the 2017 fiscal year successfully. Record figures were achieved for nearly all key performance indicators, most notably in the number of vehicles delivered: 10.7 million customers worldwide - more than ever before - opted for a model from one of the Group's brands last year. This includes vehicles sold by the Chinese joint ventures, which handed over 4.2 million vehicles to customers in the 2017 reporting period (including Hong Kong and imports), 5.1 percent more than in the previous year.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Group sales revenue also climbed to a new record level in 2017. <I>&quot;At EUR 230.7 billion, the Group's sales revenue was up 6.2 percent on the prior-year figure, which was a new record,&quot;</I> CFO Frank Witter explained. Operating profit before and after special items was also better than ever, amounting to EUR 17.0 billion before special items and to EUR 13.8 billion after special items. <I>&quot;Even after deducting special items, this is the best operating profit that the <A class=""ref ref13"" href=""https://www.idtechex.com/en/timeline/volkswagen/c1547"">Volkswagen Group</A> has ever achieved,&quot;</I> Witter said. The increase was primarily the result of positive volume-, mix- and margin-related factors as well as improved product costs. The operating return on sales before special items rose from 6.7 to 7.4 percent.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Overall, the operating profit was reduced by special items from the diesel issue of EUR -3.2 billion in 2017 compared with EUR -6.4 billion in the previous year. These expenses in the 2017 fiscal year were mainly attributable to higher expenses for the buy-back and retrofitting programs for 2.0 l and 3.0 l TDI vehicles in North America and to higher legal risks.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Unlike the figures for deliveries, the Group's sales revenue and operating profit do not contain the business with the Chinese joint ventures, since these are accounted for using the equity method. The joint ventures in the People's Republic generated a proportional operating profit of EUR 4.7 billion in fiscal year 2017, compared with just under EUR 5.0 billion in the previous year. In addition, a further joint venture was agreed with Chinese manufacturer Anhui Jianghuai Automobile (JAC) that will develop, produce and market electric vehicles. At a future date, the Group is also planning to export vehicles that will be manufactured in China - initially to the Philippines and later to other South East Asian markets.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><I>Source and top image:  <A class=""ref ref13"" href=""https://www.idtechex.com/en/timeline/volkswagen/c1547"">Volkswagen Group</A></I></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""sectioncontent""><DIV class=""learn-more"">Learn more at the next leading event on the topic: <A target=""_blank"" href=""//www.idtechex.com/usa2018/show/"">IDTechEx Show!

This is why we are forging ahead with the electrification of our vehicles at the same time as making conventional powertrains cleaner and more efficient. We have also set ourselves new, ambitious targets for production. By 2025, we intend to reduce environmental impact throughout the Volkswagen Group by 45 percent (energy, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, water, solvents and waste) compared with 2010. The changeover of the two power stations at the company's headquarters in Wolfsburg from coal to gas is a clear signal in this context and an important step.

On the one hand, the crops grown in the genetically homogeneous monocultures that are typical of chemical farming are vulnerable to the <mark>climate</mark> extremes that are becoming more frequent and more violent as a result of global warming.

Photo: © Basso Cannarsa</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Fortunately, there is a viable and <mark>sustainable</mark> alternative to industrial agriculture. It consists of a variety of agricultural techniques, based on ecological principles that have been refined over the past century and are being adopted around the world, especially in the past two decades. With these techniques, healthy biodiverse foods are grown in decentralized, community-oriented, energy-efficient, and <mark>sustainable</mark> ways. These ecologically-oriented farming techniques include organic-certified farming, permaculture, and biodynamic farming. In recent years, the term “agroecology” has increasingly been used as a unifying term, referring to both the scientific basis and the practice of an agriculture based on ecological principles.</P><P>Agroecology is <mark>sustainable</mark> because it dramatically reduces the need for off-farm inputs, is dependent on the saving and sharing of seeds versus purchased seeds, and can be fostered through farmer-to-farmer education not through expensive inputs. Of critical importance for the future of agriculture is the observation that resilience to extreme <mark>climate</mark> events is closely linked to agricultural biodiversity, which is a key characteristic of agroecology. Agroecological practices are labor-intensive and community-oriented, thereby reducing poverty and social exclusion. In these ways, agroecology is able to raise agricultural productivity in ways that are economically viable, environmentally benign and socially uplifting.</P><P>When soil is farmed organically, moreover, its <mark>carbon</mark> content increases, and by sequestering <mark>carbon</mark> in this way organic farming can contribute to reducing the concentration of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere. In other words, agroecology not only is more resistant to global warming than industrial agriculture; it also helps stabilize the <mark>climate</mark>, whereas industrial agriculture aggravates <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>In recent years, agroecology has taken off around the world. The rapid growth of the peasant-led international movement <A href=""https://viacampesina.org/en/"">La Via Campesina</A> and of the <A href=""https://www.ifoam.bio/"">International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements</A> speak to the interest in scaling up this approach to agriculture. Organizations like <A href=""https://www.socla.co/en/"">SOCLA</A> in Latin America and the Campesino a Campesino (farmer-to-farmer) network in Central America have reached thousands of farmers across the region. All together, these groups have helped to train hundreds of thousands of farmers in agroecological approaches, proving that the shift from industrial agriculture to agroecological practices is not only urgently needed, but is also practical and can be achieved without new technologies or expensive investments. What we need now to scale up agroecology from successful local and regional projects to the global level is political will and visionary global leadership.</P><P><EM>This article is an abstract of a longer piece, “<A href=""http://www.abocashop.com/en/agricoltura-e-cambiamento-climatico-2"">Agricolutura e Cambiamento Climatico</A>” (Agriculture and <mark>Climate Change</mark>) published in Italian by <A href=""http://www.abocamuseum.it/en/"">Aboca</A>.</EM></P><P><EM><A href=""http://www.fritjofcapra.net/"">Fritjof Capra</A>, Ph.D., is a scientist, educator, activist, and author of many international bestsellers that connect conceptual changes in science with broader changes in worldview and values in society.</EM></P><P><EM><A href=""https://annalappe.com/"">Anna Lappé</A> is a national bestselling author, a respected advocate for sustainability and justice along the food chain and an advisor to funders investing in food system transformation.

Volkswagen was conducting an internal investigation because of the <A href=""https://www.politico.eu/article/vw-emissions-scandal-volkswagen-diesel-dealer-violation-emissions-standards/"" target=""_blank"">emissions scandal</A> revealed in September, when it admitted that 11 million cars had been rigged with so-called defeat devices to cheat on tests for smog-causing nitrous oxides, or NOx.</P><P>That internal probe turned up incorrectly low CO<SUB>2</SUB> and fuel consumption figures, which could apply to as many as  800,000 vehicles from the Volkswagen Group, of which about 200,000 are on German roads. This would also include cars from brands such as Audi, Skoda and Seat.</P><P>This time, Volkswagen said the problem wasn’t just confined to the diesel engines implicated in the NOx scandal. Alexander Dobrindt, Germany’s transport minister, told the Bundestag Wednesday that 98,000 of the 800,000 affected vehicles were powered by gasoline.</P><P>Volkswagen didn’t indicate by how much the cars overshoot their stated <mark>CO2</mark> figures, which makes it difficult to quantify precisely the potential damage to the company.</P><H3>The money</H3><P>Volkswagen says it could cost about €2 billion to fix the <mark>CO2</mark> problem. That breaks down to about €2,500 per car. By contrast, VW booked a charge of €6.5 billion to cover expenses related to the NOx scandal, or only about €680 per car.</P><P>The higher cost “likely covers the cost of repaying tax credits or similar that vehicles earned due to lower <mark>CO2</mark> test statistics than should have been awarded,” wrote Stuart Pearson, an analyst with Exane Paribas BNP.</P><P>Dobrindt said that if Volkswagen’s per-car <mark>CO2</mark> values have to be downgraded, the German government will have to impose “another kind of automobile tax … that is also valid retroactively.”</P><P>VW is going to have to foot the whole bill, the minister said: “We’re working with the finance ministry on a law that will make sure the customer won’t be burdened.”</P><P>That’s not the only cost faced by VW. Irate car owners could sue the company for selling cars with misstated fuel consumption, making their cars more expensive to run. The issue could also affect the resale value of VW cars.</P><P>Still, the carmaker doesn’t appear to be <A href=""https://www.politico.eu/article/sorry-folks-volkswagen-wont-die-emissions-germany/"" target=""_blank"">in danger of going under</A>: UBS estimated VW faces a total cost of €35 billion, including repair costs of about €10 billion as well as litigation and fines. “This development will however certainly add to pressure on VW shares and on-going concerns about costs as well as ethics and governance at the group level,” UBS wrote.</P><P>That’s already evident on the Deutsche Börse in Frankfurt, where Volkswagen has shed a third of its value since the emissions scandal first broke in mid-September. Its shares fell a further 10 percent after the <mark>CO2</mark> problem was revealed late Tuesday.</P><H3><STRONG>Has Volkswagen cheated again?</STRONG></H3><P>Dobrindt met with Volkswagen and later told MPs, “Clearly, measures were taken by VW during the test of <mark>CO2</mark> emissions and consumption which falsified the consumption levels downwards.”</P><P>In its original statement on Tuesday night, Volkswagen had said, “The <mark>CO2</mark> levels and thus the fuel consumption figures for some models were set too low during the <mark>CO2</mark> certification process.”</P><P>Dobrindt said all measures which might have led to the falsification of data would need to be checked and investigated. The car company may have taken steps like manipulating tire pressure to tweak emissions output, he said.</P><P>The German government has ordered tests on all current diesel and gasoline-powered Volkswagen Group cars, both for NOx and <mark>CO2</mark> emissions.</P><P>“New test results must be established,” Dobrindt said.“The customer has the right to discover the true situation of their cars.”</P><H3>Reputational damage</H3><P>It’s <A href=""https://www.politico.eu/article/raid-at-vw-as-germany-launches-criminal-fraud-investigation-emissions-testing-cheat/"" target=""_blank"">terrible news for Germany</A>. Volkswagen was an icon of Teutonic efficiency, but that image has been seriously undermined.</P><P>“It’s unnecessary to stress my irritation that there is once again a case of this magnitude,” Dobrindt said.</P><P>It’s also battering Volkswagen’s reputation. The carmaker had only recently become the world’s largest automaker, but has now been overtaken by Toyota. Sales figures haven’t yet shown a steep downturn, but analysts to expect that to change.</P><P>“The impact of the latest <mark>CO2</mark> admission may be greater, as customers may well care more about fuel economy than NOx,” wrote BNP’s Pearson.</P><P>It’s not only Volkswagen which is in danger. Other European carmakers also rely heavily on diesel engines, and Europe’s testing procedures for certifying car emissions have long been something of a joke.</P><P>“We do know that ‘real world’ <mark>CO2</mark> data is consistently shown to be far higher than test statistics for essentially all [carmakers],” wrote Pearson.</P><P>NGOs have long pointed to the defects of Europe’s car tests.</P><P>“This widening of the VW scandal is shocking but it doesn’t come as a surprise,” said Monique Goyens, director general of BEUC, the European consumer organization. “It sadly confirms what we have said since a long time. The whole testing system in Europe is flawed because there is no room for independent testing and there is also no obligation to make real life testing, on-the-road testing.”</P><H3>Rising political pressure</H3><P>The EU is already revamping testing procedures to take them out of the lab and on to the road. That means stunts like taping over the cracks in doors and removing side mirrors in order to boost ratings will no longer be allowed. The new system will start to be applied to some cars by 2017.</P><P>The Commission wants action from VW as well.</P><P>“The Commission invites Volkswagen to speed up its internal investigation to clarify without delay what kind of <mark>CO2</mark> emissions irregularities were found, what has caused them, which cars are affected, where they were registered, and what measures the group will undertake to remedy the situation,” said spokeswoman Lucia Caudet.</P><P>In the European Parliament,  Rebecca Harms, co-president of the Greens, said the recent revelations show a systemic problem with the car industry and its regulation. She called on the Commission to undertake a comprehensive investigation and “ensure any transgressions are properly sanctioned.”</P><H3><STRONG>What about the <mark>climate</mark>?</STRONG></H3><P>The NOx issue didn’t have an impact on global warming because nitrous oxides are the main ingredient of smog, which pollutes cities and increases respiratory diseases but doesn’t heat the planet. However, <mark>CO2</mark> is the leading greenhouse gas, raising questions over whether VW’s problems will undermine the EU’s commitments on reducing emissions.</P><P>“Today, I cannot estimate what consequences this will have on our <mark>climate</mark> goals since we don’t know the real additional emissions,” Dobrindt said, adding: “By establishing new values this will become clear and then we can make a comment.”</P><P>The European Commission was keen to underline that the EU was on course to overshoot its 2020 <mark>climate</mark> target, which calls for a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels.</P><P>Carmakers have their emissions measured on a fleet basis as of 2012, taking into account all the cars they have on the road. The permitted average for Volkswagen last year was 131.2 grams of <mark>CO2</mark> per kilometer, a figure the carmaker has consistently beaten.</P><P>The Commission <A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/vehicles/cars/index_en.htm"" target=""_blank"" target=""_blank"">can fine carmakers</A> whose vehicles break the emissions rules. and has done so in the past with Russia’s AvtoVAZ and Ferrari. If the recalibration puts VW above that limit, it could face fines on each registered vehicle of €5 for the first gram per kilometer above the limit, €15 for the second, €25 for the third and €95 for each subsequent gram.</P><ASIDE class=""story-supplement""><DIV class=""content-categories""><H6>Related stories on these topics:</H6></DIV></ASIDE></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

If that proves correct, VW’s defective vehicles could be responsible for between 237,161 and 948,691 tonnes of NOx emissions each year, 10 to 40 times the <mark>pollution</mark> standard for new models in the US. Western Europe’s biggest power station, Drax in the UK, emits 39,000 tonnes of NOx each year.</P><P>Germany’s Tagesspiegel newspaper said on Tuesday that VW’s board would replace Winterkorn, who has led the company since early 2007, with Matthias Mueller, who runs the company’s Porsche sports car division. Volkswagen rejected Tagesspiegel’s report and Winterkorn continued to ask for the public’s trust on Tuesday, saying the scandal was caused by “the bad mistakes of a few”. But Wednesday’s meeting will prove crucial to how VW responds. </P><P>The company’s shares fell 10% as the German stock market opened on Wednesday although recouped some early losses. A third - some €25bn - of the company’s stock market value had already been lost since Friday when the emissions scandal first emerged.</P><P>New York and other state attorney generals are forming a group to investigate the scandal, New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman said, adding to a series of investigations in the US, <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Europe</A> and Asia that threaten to sap Volkswagen’s resources and impose large penalties.</P><P>In the US, just <A href=""http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1097513_which-states-have-the-most-diesel-vehicles-new-data-gives-results"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">3% of passenger cars are diesel</A> compared with almost half in the EU. Prof Martin Williams of King’s College London said the US’s low percentage of diesel cars meant higher diesel emissions in some cars would have a “limited effect” on air quality there.</P><P>“[In the US it would be] nowhere near the effect it would have in this country and in the rest of Europe for that matter,” he said. In the UK, Williams added, emissions from diesel cars cause roughly 5,800 premature deaths each year. “If you were to make the cars emit at the legal limit you could reduce those deaths by at least a factor of two and maybe more. Maybe a factor of five.”</P><P>The <A href=""http://cleanair.london/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Clean Air in London campaign</A> called for a royal commission to investigate carmakers’ activities in the UK. “Diesel is without doubt the biggest public health catastrophe in UK history. Even the black plague didn’t affect everyone in the population,” said its founder, Simon Birkett.</P><P>Not all NOx emissions – which include nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrogen oxide (NO) – are dangerous. But <A href=""http://cleanair.london/sources/investigation-into-governments-failure-to-control-carcinogenic-diesel-exhaust/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">an increasing proportion</A> of the toxic NO<SUB tabindex=""-1"">2 </SUB>gas has been detected in EU diesel emissions.

Testing regimes in the EU are known to fail to pick up “real world” emissions because cars are not driven in the same way in the laboratory as on the road. Some studies suggest the discrepancy may be <A draggable=""true"" href=""http://www.theicct.org/real-world-exhaust-emissions-modern-diesel-cars"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">up to seven times the legal limit</A>.</P><P>Williams said being able to mask their NOx emissions would also enable carmakers to pass <mark>carbon</mark> emissions tests more easily as there was a trade-off between NOx and <mark>CO2</mark> in diesel engines.</P><P>Catherine Bearder MEP, a lead negotiator on the EU’s new air quality laws, said: “Manufacturers in the US have been caught out, but we know that <mark>pollution</mark> limits are also being breached in Europe ...

For years, Volkswagen enticed customers with “clean diesel” adverts. The emissions scandal revealed that defeat software was installed in up to 11m cars which meant clean diesel technology was only activated when the car detected it was being driven under test conditions.

Brought together, these threads – I would argue – can be viewed as four behavioural traits that have come to define today’s corporation: </P><H2>1. Relentless pursuit of size </H2><P>The search for scale was typified over a century ago by Ford Motor Company. The term Fordism was coined to describe a strategy of growth to achieve economies of scale. </P><P>A century later, Volkswagen’s declared goal was to be the world’s number one car company by 2018. Volkswagen bet on its “fuel efficient” diesel-powered cars to achieve this and made an unethical choice to fit these cars with defeat devices, while pursuing a misleading advertising campaign around “clean diesel”.</P><P>For its part, ExxonMobil clearly saw the consequences of pursuing fossil fuels, but still chose to lead the denial lobby as that best served its financial interests in oil and gas. It spent <A href=""http://www.exxonsecrets.org/html/index.php"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">more than $30m</A> (£20.3m) between 1998 and 2014 funding <mark>climate</mark> scepticism, according to Greenpeace. </P><P>No doubt it recovered those costs many times over as it grew to become one of the largest corporations in the world, but it did so at immense public cost – the advancing upheavals of <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><H2>2. Aggressive and unethical lobbying</H2><P>Exxon’s brand of “scientific” lobbying obfuscated reality, reduced the urgency of <mark>climate change</mark> responses and was downright unethical. </P><P>Despite agreeing to stop funding <mark>climate</mark> denial in 2007, the company was since found to have <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/15/exxon-mobil-gave-millions-<mark>climate</mark>-denying-lawmakers"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">donated $2.3m</A> (£1.5m) to members of Congress and <mark>climate</mark> denying lobby group the American Legislative Exchange Council.

Essentially, the devices allowed cars to recognize when they were undergoing emissions testing and switched the cars into lower-operation modes. This ultimately led to Volkswagen cars emitting far greater concentrations of nitrous oxide than they reported. California was since involved in two settlements with Volkswagen. The first was a fairly global settlement that involved a joint effort with the California AG’s office, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), EPA, and other states. California participated in the settlement talks in order to receive part of the $14.7 billion agreement and to carve out California civil liability. As part of the larger settlement, California got $1.18 billion to repay consumers, invest in environmental projects, and invest in zero-emissions technology. Part of the funding ($380 million) went directly to CARB for environmental mitigation projects in the state. The second settlement finalized the civil liability that California successfully carved out of the first agreement. As part of the deal, <mark>Volkswagen ag</mark>reed to pay $86 million in civil penalties. $10 million of those funds went to local governments and research institutions to better detect defeat devices in the future.

Deemed as one of the biggest contributors to increased greenhouse gases, the auto industry has garnered much negative attention in regards to <mark>climate change</mark>, and Volkswagen (VW) is a prime example of an automaker rushing to reinvent themselves and stay ahead of regulations, while keeping their brand image intact.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Design of the Car</STRONG></P><P>Emissions regulations are becoming stricter by the year, especially with hard to ignore global manifestations of <mark>climate change</mark>. In addition to restrictions on fuel emissions from active machines, there are now additional restrictions on such emissions when machines are off and resting. Consequently, car manufacturers have had to redesign their cars to produce better fuel efficiency as well as improved fuel storage tanks. In their 2014 Sustainability Report, Volkswagen reported that 57 cars in their portfolio already met the 2020 EU new-fleet car emissions target of 95g CO­­<SUB>2 </SUB>/km. Furthermore, each new car VW designs promises to be 10-15% more fuel efficient than its predecessor.</P><P>Lastly, VW cars are now designed so that 85-95% of the car is recyclable; however, how the company retrieves old cars for recyclable material and how much they have used recycled material in their new cars has not been disclosed by the company.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Design of the Plant and Production Process</STRONG></P><P>Volkswagen reports that over the years their manufacturing process has become much more efficient and consequently, has decreased emissions from production every year. In 2014, Volkswagen reported their worldwide manufacturing processes saw an average of 23.2% reduction in CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions, 18.5% reduction in energy consumption, and a 21.7% reduction in waste for disposal. These results were achieved mainly by switching to renewable energy to power the plants, innovating processes such as painting cars to rely less on water, and recycling water and waste products in the production process. In addition, VW has attained ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 certification at many of their sites and is continuing to improve uncertified sites with the goal of achieving these certifications.</P><P><STRONG> </STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Cannibalization of their main product?</STRONG></P><P>While the fossil fuel driven car is VW’s main product, increased consumer awareness of <mark>climate change</mark> coupled with stricter regulations are forcing the company to invent eco-friendly products that may one day entirely replace what has been the bread and butter of VW:</P><OL><LI>VW is producing hybrid cars that can use both oil and electricity as fuel, and have CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions as low as 35 g/km, approximately one third of that of traditional vehicles.</LI><LI>Some Volkswagen brands such as Audi are moving towards alternative energy as fuel. The company has developed a method of producing “e-gas” which offers the same power as fossil fuels, but is generated using wind power, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and water. Volkswagen admits that there is still lack of infrastructure around e-gas – only available at some gas stations – which has hindered customer adoption of this technology.</LI><LI>VW has been investing in car-sharing and building buses. In a time when there is increased incentivization for people to reduce emissions by using common transport, VW runs the risk of decreasing their car sales.</LI></OL><P> </P><P><STRONG>Other Considerations</STRONG></P><P>When judging the success of any sustainability endeavor, it is important to ask what is the net effect of the company’s operations on the environment and which metrics are being used measure it. For example, VW could simply use aluminum to make their cars lighter, which would in turn produce increased mileage. However, the extraction of aluminum is itself a highly energy intensive process, and so could outweigh the environmental benefits of reducing fuel consumption in cars. Additionally, although the company seemed to be performing well with regards to sustainability when measured against CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions regulations, they were 40 times over the limit for NOx emissions, and were found to be falsifying NOx emissions data, leading to the “emissiongate” scandal of 2015. This illustrates that although companies are being forced to comply to stricter environmental regulations, they are likely to feel pressured to scam their way out of such regulations or to find ways to address parts of the problem while exacerbating others.</P><P> </P><P>Finally, improving sustainability is not a simple, one-way equation. Just as companies, governments, and consumers are responsible for driving <mark>climate change</mark> to its current state, all parties must similarly be involved in undoing centuries of negligence. Companies like Volkswagen, who arguably have a more direct impact on <mark>climate change</mark>, must lead the way in creating innovative methods to reduce and even sequester CO<SUB>2</SUB>, because it is only a matter of time before both government regulations and consumer demands force change upon them.</P><P> </P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

<mark>Climate change</mark> poses a major challenge to U.S. agriculture, because of the critical dependence of the agricultural system on <mark>climate</mark> and because of the complex role agriculture plays in social and economic systems. <mark>Climate change</mark> has the potential to both positively and negatively affect the location, timing, and productivity of crop, livestock, and fishery systems at local, national, and global scales.

The agricultural sector continually adapts through a variety of strategies that have allowed previous agricultural production to increase, as evidenced by the continued growth in production and efficiency across the United States.

Frost-free season is projected to lengthen across much of the nation. Taking advantage of the increasing length of the growing season and changing planting dates could allow planting of more diverse crop rotations, which can be an effective adaptation strategy.
</P><P>
The annual maximum number of consecutive dry days (less than 0.01 inches of rain) is projected to increase, especially in the western and southern parts of the nation, negatively affecting crop and animal production. The trend toward more consecutive dry days and higher temperatures will increase evaporation and add stress to limited water resources, affecting irrigation and other water uses.<SUP id=""fnref:4aa147eb-3cc7-4ebd-99db-c02731e93a3d""><A href=""#fn:4aa147eb-3cc7-4ebd-99db-c02731e93a3d"" rel=""footnote"">4</A></SUP></P><P>
Hot nights are defined as nights with a minimum temperature higher than 98% of the minimum temperatures between 1971 and 2000. Such nights are projected to increase throughout the nation.

                Taking effective action can turn risk into competitive advantage.
            </P><P><STRONG>From the early days</STRONG> of seafaring trade, dealing with the weather has been an integral part of doing business. Today, however, concerns over <mark>climate change</mark> are taking this to a whole new level, and companies will have to adapt to growing regulatory, environmental, and consumer pressures.</P><P>
This is a daunting prospect. That may explain why, in a survey of S&amp;P Global 100 companies by the Center for <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy Solutions, only 28 percent said they had done <mark>climate</mark> assessments, and an even smaller number (18 percent) said they use <mark>climate</mark>-specific tools or models to assess their risks.<A onclick=""return false;"" href=""#"" rel=""#footnote1"" class=""link-footnote""><SUP>1</SUP></A><SPAN style=""display: none;"" class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote1""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">1.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text""><EM>Weathering the Storm: Building Business Resilience to <mark>Climate Change</mark></EM>, Center for <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy Solutions, 2013, c2es.org.
</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN> But delay is not a strategy. Organizations can benefit by taking action to recognize and even anticipate such <mark>climate</mark>-related risks as changing government policies, product-preference shifts, and price volatility.<A onclick=""return false;"" href=""#"" rel=""#footnote2"" class=""link-footnote""><SUP>2</SUP></A><SPAN style=""display: none;"" class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote2""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">2.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text"">“<A href=""/insights/energy_resources_materials/the_business_of_sustainability_mckinsey_global_survey_results"">The business of sustainability: McKinsey Global Survey results</A>,” October 2011.
</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P>
There are, in broad terms, six different kinds of <mark>climate</mark> risks (Exhibit 1). These can be divided into two interconnected groups: value-chain risks and external-stakeholder risks.</P><FIGURE id=""exhibit-main_0_ctl13_h4Headline"" class=""text-s exhibit "" data-module=""Exhibit"" aria-labelledby=""main_0_ctl13_h4Headline"" aria-describedby=""main_0_ctl13_divDescription""><FIGCAPTION class=""metadata""><DIV class=""eyebrow"">Exhibit 1</DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H2>Value-chain risks</H2><P><EM>Physical risks</EM> are those related to damage inflicted on infrastructure and other assets, such as factories and supply-chain operations, by the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as wildfires, floods, or hurricanes. According to the <EM>New England Journal of Medicine</EM>, the frequency and severity of <mark>climate</mark>-related disasters like floods, droughts, and storm surges has increased markedly since the 1970s.</P><P>
This can affect company performance in real and visible ways. In 2012, for example, Cargill, one of the world’s largest food and agricultural companies, posted its worst quarterly earnings in two decades, in large part because of the US drought. While no single event can be attributed to <mark>climate change</mark>, of course, this is an example of how <mark>climate</mark> can and does affect business prospects. Western Digital Technologies, a major supplier of hard disk drives, posted a sharp decline in revenues in 2011 after flooding in Thailand, where most of its production was located. That loss of production meant global supply slumped, with severe reverberations for computer manufacturers.</P><P>
Such physical risks are impossible to control, but companies can take steps to prepare for the changes that could occur in years and decades to come. First, it helps to forecast a range of reasonable scenarios; doing so may require the help of specialized <mark>climate</mark> modelers. <mark>Climate</mark> forecasting can highlight high-level risk probabilities by region, such as for flood, drought, or sea-level rise, and for long-term changes in such factors as temperature, humidity, or rainfall patterns. The scenarios should help reveal which parts of the business are vulnerable. A variety of mitigating risk processes, technical standards, and capabilities can then be put in place. In the long term, risk management could call for changes to supply chains (to build in geographic variability or redundancy), including moving away from suppliers and/or locations that are highly exposed.</P><P><EM>Price risks</EM> refer to the increased price volatility of raw materials and other commodities. Drought can raise the price of water; <mark>climate</mark>-related regulation can drive up the cost of energy. High-tech and renewable-energy industries, for example, face price risks in the competition for rare earths, which are used in the production of computer hard drives, televisions, wind turbines, solar photovoltaic systems, and electric vehicles.</P><P>

Some companies are taking significant steps to get ahead of this concern. IKEA is in the process of substituting renewables for conventional sources of energy; in time, it hopes to be largely self-sufficient with regard to power. In that event, the retailer will have a good idea of what price it will pay for power and will insulate itself against global and regional energy price spikes.<A onclick=""return false;"" href=""#"" rel=""#footnote4"" class=""link-footnote""><SUP>4</SUP></A><SPAN style=""display: none;"" class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote4""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">4.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text"">“Ikea unveils plans to use 100% clean energy by 2020,”<EM>Guardian</EM>, October 23, 2012, theguardian.com.
</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN> Volkswagen is doing something similar.

Antonio Volpin, “How businesses can address the risks related to energy consumption,”<EM>Energy World</EM>, January 2014, energyinst.org.
</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><EM>Product risks</EM> refer to core products becoming unpopular or even unsellable. Effects could range from losing a little market share to going under entirely. Alternative cooling technologies, for example, could conceivably displace air-conditioning systems; ski resorts that no longer can count on snow or cold weather could go under. Regulatory and production costs could raise the price of coal in some markets above that of lower-<mark>carbon</mark> competition, with ripple effects for mining-equipment manufacturers and related industries.</P><P>
This kind of risk, of course, is familiar; new products, by definition, displace older ones. The difference is that responding to <mark>climate</mark>-related pressures can change the entire context in which a business operates, not just a specific segment. It’s more like the change from the horse-and-buggy era to the car than shifting from manual to automatic transmission. Utilities, for one, know this; they are seeing their traditional business model threatened in markets where renewable energy accounts for a greater part of new generation.</P><P>
On the positive side, however, greener products are emerging in a number of industries. The construction and infrastructure sectors are developing new products and services that cater to cleaner cities, such as electric-vehicle charging infrastructure, renewables integration, smart metering, smart grids, congestion-fee  systems, and high-performance building technologies.</P><P>
In the business-to-consumer sectors, especially retail and consumer products, new segments are making inroads as people make it clear they are willing to pay for greener products. Groceries advertised as <mark>sustainable</mark>, for example, are growing fast in the United States, and the organic-food sector has seen double-digit growth for the past decade. This is a testament to the emergence of a significant cohort of customers for whom environmental consciousness is a factor in where and what they buy.</P><P>
How can companies adapt? One approach is to adopt a “design to sustainability” approach, in which new products are designed to minimize waste and to be broken down for reuse or recycling. Another is to redefine corporate strategy to align business interests with <mark>climate</mark>-change mitigation and adaptation. Siemens, for instance, has developed a dedicated “environmental portfolio” of <mark>carbon</mark>-efficient products, while Saint-Gobain, the construction and packaging giant, puts <mark>sustainable</mark> housing technologies at the core of its product-development strategy.</P><H2>External-stakeholder risks</H2><P>We define <EM>ratings risk</EM> as the possibility of higher costs of capital because of <mark>climate</mark>-related exposure such as <mark>carbon</mark> pricing, supply-chain disruption, or product obsolescence.</P><P>
While the ratings risk varies widely between and within industries, even companies with <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive activities can start to manage it. Already, more than 4,000 organizations are reporting their exposure to the CDP (previously known as the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project), a first step in dealing with the issue. A number of oil majors use an internal <mark>carbon</mark> price to guide some of their strategic decisions.</P><ASIDE class="" text-l -span-right disruptor ""><DIV class=""disruptor-content""><SPAN id=""main_0_ctl15_sectionHeadline"" class=""title headline"">Would you like to learn more about our <A href=""/business-functions/sustainability-and-resource-productivity/how-we-help-clients"">Sustainability &amp; Resource Productivity Practice</A>?</SPAN></DIV></ASIDE><P><EM>Regulation risk</EM> refers to government action prompted by <mark>climate change</mark>. This can take many forms, including rules that add costs or impede specific business activities, subsidies in support of a competitor, or withdrawal of subsidies. In many industries, government plays a crucial role in setting the rules of the game; with <mark>climate change</mark> in mind, many of those rules are changing.</P><P>
Around the world, we are seeing governments respond to the possibility of <mark>climate change</mark> in ways that necessarily affect business prospects. To cite just a few examples: China is launching <mark>carbon</mark>-trading programs in seven regions in preparation for a potential national plan by 2020. Most US states have introduced renewable portfolio standards, which require a certain proportion of the state’s electricity to be produced from renewable sources. Ethiopia has charted a course to become a middle-income country through low-emissions growth with its <mark>Climate</mark>-Resilient Green Economy strategy.</P><P>
One complication is that on the national and international level, <mark>climate</mark>-change policies often change, sometimes with the speed of an election result. That makes it difficult for businesses to make long-term investment and operating decisions. Businesses can, however, take the initiative in managing regulation risk. The first step in preparing for and helping to shape future regulation is to understand the policy options. The second step is to develop an internal strategy on <mark>climate change</mark> to put the company in a position to react effectively to regulations and policy changes. The final step is to work with external stakeholders, such as regulators and industry groups, to get their perspectives.</P><P><EM>Reputation risk</EM> can be either direct, stemming from a company-specific action or policy, or indirect, in the form of public perception of the overall industry. In the <mark>climate</mark>-change context, reputation risk can be understood as the probability of profitability loss following a business’s activities or positions that the public considers harmful. A poor reputation on <mark>climate</mark> can hurt sales through consumer boycotts or local community protests. It could damage the regulatory environment and investor relationships. And it could make the company less attractive to current or future employees.</P><P>
This is part of a larger trend: the changing expectations of stakeholders. Investors are asking for disclosure of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and starting to lodge concerns about “stranded” assets—those that become unusable due to <mark>climate</mark>-policy regulation or physical <mark>climate change</mark>. Many employees want sustainability to be part of the day-to-day operations of their companies. Nongovernmental organizations are getting more prominence when it comes to their ability to measure and compare corporate actions.</P><P>
In response, some companies have taken very public steps to adopt <mark>climate</mark>-change strategies. Unilever, for example, leads the FTSE CDP <mark>Carbon</mark> Strategy risk and performance index and has improved its <mark>carbon</mark> efficiency by 40 percent since 1995. Its stated goal is to reduce the <mark>carbon</mark> and water footprints of its products to half of 2010 levels by 2020. The retailer Kohl’s has been recognized for its efforts to green its operations and reduce emissions.<A onclick=""return false;"" href=""#"" rel=""#footnote7"" class=""link-footnote""><SUP>7</SUP></A><SPAN style=""display: none;"" class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote7""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">7.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text""><EM>Partner Profile</EM>, United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2015, epa.gov.
</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN> IBM has also gotten positive attention for its actions on <mark>climate</mark>, such as setting rigorous greenhouse-gas-emission standards for suppliers.

</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN> Just about every company in the Fortune 500 touts its commitment to sustainability.

Results for individual companies will vary, of course, depending on geography, target markets, and management. But this chart is a useful way to look at the economic landscape.</P><P>
One truth is evident across all these industries: companies that ignore <mark>climate</mark>-related risks are likely to feel the consequences. Those that identify the most pertinent risks, think through how they relate to one another, and then put in place appropriate measures can begin to manage the challenges ahead. These companies will not only put themselves in position to ride out the storm; they could rise above it.</P><FOOTER id=""main_0_divAboutAuthors"" role=""contentinfo"" class=""about-authors text-s""><H4 class=""headline"">About the author(s)</H4><STRONG>Hauke Engel</STRONG> is a consultant in McKinsey’s Frankfurt office, <STRONG>Per-Anders Enkvist</STRONG> is a principal in the Stockholm office, and <STRONG>Kimberly Henderson</STRONG> is a consultant in the London office.The authors wish to thank Blandine Antoine and Julien Cochard for their contributions to this article.

But critics say the pressure on managers at Volkswagen was unusual, which may go some way to explaining the carmaker’s crisis. </P><DIV class=""container_2pnvl""><DIV class=""container_1tVQo"" tabindex=""-1""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption_KoNH1""><SPAN>Martin Winterkorn speaks at the annual news conference of Volkswagen in Berlin, in this file picture taken March 12, 2015.   REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/Files</SPAN></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></DIV></DIV><P>Three weeks after it admitted to cheating U.S. emissions tests, Europe’s largest carmaker is under pressure to identify who exactly was responsible. </P><P>Volkswagen (<SPAN id=""”symbol_VOWG_p.DE_0”""><A href=""/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=VOWG_p.DE"">VOWG_p.DE</A></SPAN>) has declined to comment on whether the firm’s culture or the management style of Winterkorn, who resigned last month, had been a factor in the cheating. Lawyers for Winterkorn did not respond to a request for comment. </P><P>But now that VW’s problems are coming out into the open and Winterkorn has gone, some executives are declaring that the company needs to change its approach. </P><P>“We have to streamline our processes,” Volkswagen Group of America CEO Michael Horn told a U.S. congressional hearing when asked about what the revelations said about VW’s integrity. </P><P>“This company has to bloody learn and use this opportunity in order to get their act together, and 600,000 people worldwide have to be managed in a different way,” he said. “This is very, very clear.”</P><P>Bernd Osterloh, a member of VW’s supervisory board, was even more precise in a letter to staff on Sept. 24, a week after U.S. regulators revealed the cheating. </P><P>“We need in future a <mark>climate</mark> in which problems aren’t hidden but can be openly communicated to superiors,” said Osterloh, who as chief of the VW works council represents employees on the board. “We need a culture in which it’s possible and permissible to argue with your superior about the best way to go.”</P><P>Five former VW executives interviewed by Reuters and industry observers describe a management style under Winterkorn that fostered a <mark>climate</mark> of fear, an authoritarianism that went unchecked partly due to a company structure unique in the German motor industry. </P><P>“The culture and organizational structure of Volkswagen are not comparable to Daimler or BMW, it is something specific,” said Professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, automotive expert at the University of Duisburg-Essen. “All you hear when you speak to people is that there is a special pressure at VW.”</P><P>Lawyers for Winterkorn, who said when he quit that he was unaware of any wrongdoing on his part, did not respond to a request for comment. </P><H3>NO AUTHORITY </H3><P>All German companies have two boards: the management board, led by the chief executive, runs the business day-to-day, and above it the supervisory board, to which the CEO reports. The supervisory board can hire and fire management board members and must sign off on major strategic decisions. </P><P>Dudenhöffer said this system did not work well at Volkswagen. “In Daimler and BMW, you have a supervisory board that is controlling the CEO. But at VW you have no such authority,” he told Reuters. </P><P>VW’s 20-seat supervisory board gives nine seats apiece to workforce and shareholder representatives, so meeting a legal requirement to have equal representation. </P><P>But VW differs from other German carmakers in one respect -  the firm’s home state of Lower Saxony also gets two seats on the supervisory board. By contrast, Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, and BMW have no politicians on their boards. </P><P>Industry observers say the representatives from Lower Saxony and those of the workforce share a common goal: protecting jobs at one of Lower Saxony’s biggest employers. As a consequence they are willing to give the CEO a relatively free hand provided he delivers on jobs. </P><P>Henning Gebhardt of Deutsche Bank’s asset and wealth management unit, who manages VW shares, said corporate governance had not progressed at the company. </P><P>Labor officials and Lower Saxony representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </P><H3>HUMBLE BACKGROUND </H3><P>Winterkorn has supporters. Marc Trahan, a retired executive vice president at Volkswagen Group of America, said he believed Winterkorn and some of his top engineers would never have countenanced the cheating. </P><P>“I know Dr Winterkorn personally. I know these guys personally. There is no way they would have allowed this to continue if they had known that U.S. laws were being broken,” Trahan told Reuters. </P><P>VW design chief Klaus Bischoff said he could not imagine that Winterkorn knew of or tolerated cheating. “He is a hard-core engineer who was deeply engaged with the physics of a car but had nothing to do with software matters,” Bischoff said. </P><P>Winterkorn was born in 1947 into a humble background: his parents were ethnic German refugees who had recently fled  Hungary after World War Two. After studying metallurgy, he rose through the ranks at engineering and electronics group Bosch before he joined Audi in 1981, later moving to the VW brand and then the group. </P><P>At that time VW was managed by Ferdinand Piech, the grandson of the man who invented the Beetle. Legendary as a hard taskmaster, Piech dominated the firm for more than two decades as chief executive and then chairman until April this year, when an attempt to oust Winterkorn backfired and he was forced to quit himself. </P><P>Soon after becoming CEO in 2007, Winterkorn decided to make VW the world’s biggest carmaker. That meant cracking what was then the world’s biggest car market, the United States, where VW has underperformed for years and where it has now come unstuck. </P><P>The group almost doubled global annual sales to 10 million cars and its revenue to 200 billion euros ($225 billion). In the first half of this year, VW finally sold marginally more vehicles than the world number one, Toyota of Japan. </P><P>One former sales executive said the pressure soared under the target. “If you didn’t like it, you moved of your own accord or you were performance-managed out of the business,” he said. </P><P>Another former VW executive spoke of an authoritarian style, describing how sometimes CEOs of brands could be treated “quite disrespectfully”. Such grillings were not typical of the industry, said the executive, who now works for another international manufacturer. </P><P>One high level casualty was a previous VW chief in the United States, Jonathan Browning, who left the company in 2013. At the time VW sources told Reuters that he had been fired for  failing to meet aggressive sales targets. </P><P>Under Browning’s tenure, Winterkorn blamed U.S. management for a series of problems ranging from a failure to update the Passat model to seemingly prosaic matters such as paint.  </P><P>On one U.S. test drive in July 2013, Winterkorn spotted a slight bump in the paintwork of a Beetle model. According to one VW source, who declined to be named, the paint thickness exceeded company standards by less than a millimeter, but Winterkorn still lectured engineers about the waste. </P><P>On the same trip, he told staff he was unhappy that VW was not offering a shade of red that was selling well on competitors’ models. Winterkorn mentioned the issue the following year after Browning had gone. “They should have come and said ‘Herr Winterkorn, we must update the Passat’; they should have jumped on my desk,” he told Der Spiegel magazine.  </P><P>But several former managers in the VW group - whose brands also include Audi, Porsche, SEAT and Skoda - said few executives dared approach Winterkorn. </P><P>DISTANCE, FEAR, RESPECT    “There was always a distance, a fear and a respect... If he would come and visit or you had to go to him, your pulse would go up,” the former VW executive told Reuters. “If you presented bad news, those were the moments that it could become quite unpleasant and loud and quite demeaning.” The executive did not provide specific examples.  </P><P>Even in public Winterkorn ordered very senior staff around. A video shot at the Frankfurt motorshow four years ago gives a glimpse of the man’s style. The video, which is posted on YouTube, shows him inspecting a new model from South Korean rival Hyundai, surrounded by a posse of dark-suited managers. </P><P>He circles the car, inspecting the locking mechanism on its tailgate, and then climbs into the driver’s seat. First he strokes the interior trim, then he adjusts the steering wheel and discovers something that displeases him - it moves silently, unlike on VW or BMW models. </P><P>“Bischoff!” he barks in the footage - no first names or honorifics - summoning VW’s design chief. “Nothing makes a clonking sound here,” he says grumpily, pointing to the wheel. </P><P>Asked about his experience working with Winterkorn, Bischoff told Reuters: “Winterkorn always wanted the best solutions and kept pushing staff to the highest goals, but it would be wrong to portray him as a ruthless, intimidating leader. Of course he went through the roof when something went the wrong way and he didn’t only make friends with his temper. But I also experienced him as extremely human with a soft spot for peoples’ personal fates.”</P><DIV class=""container_28wm1""><DIV class=""attribution_o4ojT""><P class=""content_27_rw"">Additional reporting by Joe White, Paul Lienert and Tina Bellon; Writing by David Stamp; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall, Janet McBride</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The brand’s nearest competitor was 2015’s largest automaker, Toyota, with production ending slightly higher than 10.2 million vehicles.</P><P data-reactid=""236"">To be fair, these numbers have their vagaries (the totals do not necessarily represent sales to consumers, but often just production), yet Volkswagen is very happy with the special attention. The prominence may come as a surprise to American consumers. Though the other global manufacturers in the list’s top three spots—Toyota and General Motors—both regularly maintain similar top-tier market positions in the U.S., VW has always struggled here. Last year the Volkswagen Group of America—which includes <A href=""http://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/ad-test-drives-one-of-fastest-cars-on-planet"" data-reactid=""238"">Audi</A>, Bentley, <A href=""http://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/bugatti-chiron-worlds-fastest-car/all"" data-reactid=""240"">Bugatti</A>, <A href=""http://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/lamborghini-superveloce-convertible"" data-reactid=""242"">Lamborghini</A>, and VW—was number eight in sales, with almost 600,000 vehicles. But not only was that total number below the single niche brand of Subaru, which sold 615,000 vehicles, it represented a huge gap below the next closest manufacturer, Hyundai/Kia, which sold nearly 1.5 million.</P><FIGURE class=""embedded-image"" data-id=""5894eaa23926c56a61e9a1e6"" data-caption=""&lt;p&gt;A Volkswagen Golf Cabrio leaving the storage tower at the VW factory in Wolfsburg, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

VW’s deceitful system was purposely engineered to reduce emissions only when the vehicles were undergoing EPA testing. During normal driving, they would pollute the environment at levels up to 40 times greater than the strictures’ limits.</P><P data-reactid=""255"">Sales of diesel-powered vehicles have never been very high in the U.S.—in 2015 they accounted for just 3 percent of total new vehicles sold. Still, according to the Department of Transportation, VW had the highest proportion of diesel sales in the country, responsible for moving over half of all diesel-powered vehicles.</P><FIGURE class=""embedded-image"" data-id=""5894ec6f3926c56a61e9a1f4"" data-caption=""&lt;p&gt;Bentley is one of several car companies owned by VW.&lt;/p&gt;
"" data-type=""image"" data-reactid=""256""><FIGCAPTION class=""callout-image-caption"" data-reactid=""262""><DIV class=""caption"" data-reactid=""263""><P>Bentley is one of several car companies owned by VW.</P></DIV><DIV class=""credits"" data-reactid=""264"">Car Culture</DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P data-reactid=""265"">In the wake of the scandal, as part of its mandated settlement, VW had to offer to buy back diesel vehicles from consumers at top dollar. (Costs to the brand in the U.S. alone have been estimated to reach as high as $20 billion.) Many consumers used this payout to purchase another nondiesel VW vehicle, but many did not. The end result was that, in the U.S., in a record-setting sales year for the automobile industry overall, Volkswagen sales dropped by nearly 8 percent.</P><P data-reactid=""266"">“Diesel vehicles accounted for about 25 percent of VW’s American sales,” says Caldwell. “But the scandal definitely affected their sales of other vehicle lines here as well in 2016.”</P><P data-reactid=""267"">Of course, the record-setting numbers are not just about the American marketplace. The Volkswagen Group sells a multitude of vehicles all over the world, including in equally large or even larger markets. These markets either were more forgiving of the diesel scandal (Europe) or were not affected (China, where VW does not sell many diesel vehicles). And while the brand certainly attends to sales in developed markets, it is concurrently seeking out shares in developing markets, where the opportunity to add first-time drivers—potentially for a lifetime—is exponentially larger. VW currently makes 40 percent of its global vehicle sales in China, and sales increased by a whopping 12 percent in that market in 2016. So if you’re looking for an answer to the group’s rebound, look east.</P><FIGURE class=""embedded-image"" data-id=""5894ed4c3926c56a61e9a1f6"" data-caption=""&lt;p&gt;Bugatti is another brand in the VW family.

It lends consumers confidence that you’re not some fly-by-night manufacturer.”</P><P data-reactid=""278"">Will VW ever succeed in gaining the prominence here that it seems to hold in the rest of the world? Well, the group’s product mix—from nearly all of its large- and small-volume brands in the U.S.—is definitely shifting toward more popular SUVs and Crossovers. (Even Bentley now offers one, and Lamborghini and Rolls Royce will soon as well.) So perhaps it’s possible. Some of it depends on how soon our compatriots’ memories are wiped clean.</P><P data-reactid=""279"">“Americans have a tendency to have a short attention span,” Caldwell says. “The fact is, that happened over a year ago now, and it’s starting to fade. It’s just all the news with the indictments and the fines that could bring it back into focus for Americans.” For now, however, VW is holding its place at the top of the leaderboard.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""article-after-content"" data-reactid=""282""><DIV class=""component-tags"" data-reactid=""283""><H2 class=""tags-title"" data-reactid=""284"">Explore</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

    </STRONG>Charging electric cars without an electric cable – how does that work? Daimler AG is about to test inductive charging for the first time on a vehicle in everyday use in the form of a technically modified Mercedes-Benz A-Class. With the inductive charging principle, an electric car fitted with a special charging coil merely has to be positioned over a charging coil in the ground to start the charging process fully automatically, with no need for cable contact.

                   Agriculture both contributes to <mark>climate change</mark> and is affected by <mark>climate change</mark>. The EU needs to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions from agriculture and adapt its food-production system to cope with <mark>climate change</mark>. But <mark>climate change</mark> is only one of many pressures on agriculture. Faced with growing global demand and competition for resources, the EU’s food production and consumption need to be seen in a broader context, linking agriculture, energy, and food security.

A complex and increasingly globalised system of production and delivery has developed over time to meet our need for food and for different flavours. In today’s world, a fish caught in the Atlantic might be served within days in a restaurant in Prague alongside rice imported from India. Similarly, European food products are sold and consumed in the rest of the world.  </P><H2>Agriculture contributes to <mark>climate change</mark></H2><P>Before reaching our plates, our food is produced, stored, processed, packaged, transported, prepared, and served. At every stage, food provisioning releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Farming in particular releases significant amounts of methane and nitrous oxide, two powerful greenhouse gases. Methane is produced by livestock during digestion due to enteric fermentation and is released via belches. It can also escape from stored manure and organic waste in landfills. Nitrous oxide emissions are an indirect product of organic and mineral nitrogen fertilisers.</P><P>Agriculture accounted for 10% of the EU’s total greenhouse-gas emissions in 2012. A significant decline in livestock numbers, more efficient application of fertilisers, and better manure management reduced the EU’s emissions from agriculture by 24% between 1990 and 2012.</P><P>However, agriculture in the rest of the world is moving in the opposite direction. Between 2001 and 2011, global emissions from crop and livestock production grew by 14%. The increase occurred mainly in developing countries, due to a rise in total agricultural output. This was driven by increased global food demand and changes in food-consumption patterns due to rising incomes in some developing countries. Emissions from enteric fermentation increased 11% in this period and accounted for 39% of the sector's total greenhouse-gas outputs in 2011.</P><P>Given the central importance of food in our lives, a further reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions from agriculture remains quite challenging. Nevertheless, there is still potential to further reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions linked to food production in the EU. A better integration of innovative techniques into production methods, such as capturing methane from manure, more efficient use of fertilisers, and greater efficiency in meat and dairy production (i.e. reducing emissions per unit of food produced) can help.</P><P>In addition to such efficiency gains, changes on the consumption side can help to further lower greenhouse-gas emissions linked to food. In general, meat and dairy products have the highest global footprint of <mark>carbon</mark>, raw materials, and water per kilogramme of any food. In terms of greenhouse-gas emissions, livestock and fodder production each generate more than 3 billion tonnes of CO<SUB>2</SUB> equivalent. Post-farm transport and processing account for only a tiny fraction of the emissions linked to food. By reducing food waste and our consumption of emission-intensive food products, we can contribute to cutting the greenhouse-gas emissions of agriculture.</P><H2><mark>Climate change</mark> affects agriculture</H2><P>Crops need suitable soil, water, sunlight, and heat to grow. Warmer air temperatures have already affected the length of the growing season over large parts of Europe. Flowering and harvest dates for cereal crops are now happening several days earlier in the season. These changes are expected to continue in many regions.</P><P>In general, in northern Europe agricultural productivity might increase due to a longer growing season and an extension of the frost-free period. Warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons might also allow new crops to be cultivated. In southern Europe, however, extreme heat events and reductions in precipitation and water availability are expected to hamper crop productivity. Crop yields are also expected to vary increasingly from year to year due to extreme weather events and other factors such as pests and diseases.</P><P>In parts of the Mediterranean area, due to extreme heat and water stress in summer months, some summer crops might be cultivated in winter instead. Other areas, such as western France and south-eastern Europe, are expected to face yield reductions due to hot and dry summers without the possibility of shifting crop production into winter.</P><P>Changes in temperatures and growing seasons might also affect the proliferation and the spreading of some species, such as insects, invasive weeds, or diseases, all of which might in turn affect crop yields. A part of the potential yield losses can be offset by farming practices, such as rotating crops to match water availability, adjusting sowing dates to temperature and rainfall patterns, and using crop varieties better suited to new conditions (e.g. heat- and drought-resilient crops).</P><P>Land-based food sources are not the only food sources affected by <mark>climate change</mark>. The distribution of some fish stocks has already changed in the Northeast Atlantic, affecting the communities relying on these stocks throughout the supply chain. Along with increased maritime shipping, warmer water temperatures can also help facilitate the establishment of invasive marine species, causing local fish stocks to collapse.</P><P>Some <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>-adapt.eea.europa.eu/web/guest/eu-adaptation-policy/funding/esi"">EU funds</A>, including the <A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/clima/publications/docs/06-<mark>climate</mark>_mainstreaming_fact_sheet-eafrd_en.pdf"">European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development</A>, Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and loans from the European Investment Bank, are available to help farmers and fishing communities to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>. There are also other funds under the CAP aimed at helping to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from agricultural activities.</P><H2>Global market, global demand, global warming…</H2><P>In line with projected population growth and changes in dietary habits in favour of higher meat consumption, the global demand for food is expected to grow by up to 70% in the coming decades. Agriculture is already one of the economic sectors with the largest environmental impact. This substantial increase in demand will unsurprisingly create additional pressures. How can we meet this increasing global demand while at the same time reducing the impacts of European food production and consumption on the environment?</P><P>Reducing the amount of food produced is not a viable solution. The <A class=""external-link"" href=""http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Agricultural_production_-_crops"" target=""_self"" title="""">EU is one of the world’s largest food producers</A>, producing around one eighth of the global cereal output, two thirds of the world’s wine, half of its sugar beet, and three quarters of its olive oil<STRONG>. </STRONG>Any reduction in key staples is likely to jeopardise food security in the EU and in the world, and increase global food prices. This would make it harder for many groups around the world to access affordable and nutritious food<STRONG>. </STRONG></P><P>Producing more food out of the land that is already used for agriculture often requires heavier use of nitrogen-based fertilisers, which in turn release nitrous oxide emissions and contribute to <mark>climate change</mark>. Intensive agriculture and fertiliser use also release nitrates to the soil and to water bodies. Although not directly linked to <mark>climate change</mark>, high concentrations of nutrients (especially phosphates and nitrates) in water bodies cause eutrophication. Eutrophication promotes algae growth and depletes oxygen in the water, which in turn has severe impacts on aquatic life and water quality.</P><P>Whether in Europe or the rest of the world, meeting the growing demand for food by using more land would have serious impacts on the environment and the <mark>climate</mark>. The areas most suitable to agriculture in Europe are already cultivated to a large extent. Land, especially fertile agricultural land, is a limited resource in Europe and across the world.</P><P>Converting forest areas into agricultural land is also not a solution as this process is a source of greenhouse-gas emissions. Similar to many other land-use changes, deforestation (currently occurring mainly outside the European Union) also puts biodiversity at risk, further undermining nature’s ability to cope with <mark>climate change</mark> impacts (such as absorbing heavy rainfall).</P><H2>Competing demands</H2><P>It is clear that the world will need to produce more food and that key resources are limited. Agriculture has high impacts on the environment and the <mark>climate</mark>. Moreover, <mark>climate change</mark> affects — and will continue to affect — how much food can be produced and where.</P><P>Who gets to produce what and where is a socio-political question and is likely to become more controversial in the future. The global competition for these essential resources, especially with the pending impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>, is driving developed countries to purchase large patches of agricultural land in less-developed countries. Such land purchases and <mark>climate change</mark> impacts raise questions about food security in developing countries in particular. Food security is not only a matter of producing sufficient quantities of food, but also of having access to food of sufficient nutritional value.</P><P>This complex problem requires a coherent and integrated policy approach to <mark>climate change</mark>, energy, and food security. Faced with <mark>climate change</mark> and competition for scarce resources, the entire food system will need to transform itself and be much more resource efficient while continuously reducing its environmental impacts, including its greenhouse-gas emissions. We need to increase yields while reducing our dependence on agrochemicals, to reduce food waste, and to reduce our consumption of resource-intensive and greenhouse gas-intensive foods such as meat.</P><P>In doing this, we must also remember that farmers can play a key role in maintaining and managing Europe’s biodiversity. They are also a critical component of the rural economy. Therefore, policy measures to tackle this highly complex problem of food and the environment should take into consideration agriculture’s impacts on the environment and its socio-economic importance for many communities.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""relatedItems""><H2>Related content</H2><DIV class=""sorter_ctl"" style=""margin-bottom: 1.5em; display:none;""><LABEL for=""sort_by""><SPAN>Sort by:</SPAN></LABEL></DIV><DIV class=""visualNoMarker""><H3 class=""notoc"">News and articles</H3><DIV><DIV class=""photoAlbumEntry"" data-effective=""1435658400000"" data-title=""Living in a changing <mark>climate</mark>""><A href=""https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/living-in-a-changing-<mark>climate</mark>"" title=""Living in a changing <mark>climate</mark>"" class=""""><SPAN class=""photoAlbumEntryTitle"">Living in a changing <mark>climate</mark></SPAN><SPAN class=""photoAlbumEntryDescription"">Our <mark>climate</mark> is changing.
