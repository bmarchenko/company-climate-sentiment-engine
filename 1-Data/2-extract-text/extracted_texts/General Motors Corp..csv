These companies represent a huge variety of sectors, including heavy emitters such as power and cement producers, and cover all major geographies around the globe. </P><P>The commitments now include more than 200 of the world’s biggest companies setting targets through the <A href=""http://sciencebasedtargets.org/"">Science Based Targets initiative</A>, such as Walmart, General Mills, Diageo and recently joined United Technologies Corporation. While 87 companies have committed to source 100% renewable electricity as part of the <A href=""https://www.the<mark>climate</mark>group.org/RE100"">RE100</A> commitment, including Google, Apple General Motors, and new joiners Danske Bank and Gatwick Airport.</P><P>Here are 5 reasons that have helped drive 500 companies to commit to take action on <mark>climate change</mark>:</P><P><STRONG>The costs savings are enormous  </STRONG></P><P>Businesses are realising huge cost savings as a direct result of driving down emissions, proving taking action on <mark>climate change</mark> is good for the bottom line. For example, Walmart has saved nearly $1 billion in the past fiscal year and avoided emitting almost 650,000 metric tons of <mark>CO2</mark>, by doubling the efficiency of its US fleet between 2005 to 2015.</P><P>General Motors is saving an estimated $5 million annually by using renewable energy, and it expects such savings to rise significantly as more projects come online and supply increases. And by using wind power at just one of its plants, Tata Motors saved the company more than $2.5 million in fiscal year 2014-15, because it didn’t have to pay for grid electricity.</P><P><STRONG>Business emission reduction targets have a global impact </STRONG></P><P>The benefits of <mark>climate</mark> action can spread beyond the company to positively impact a huge variety of connected industries, from the power grids providing industries with electricity to the supply chains companies rely on. </P><P>RE100 Member companies (87 and growing) are now creating demand for approximately <A href=""https://www.the<mark>climate</mark>group.org/news/re100-annual-report-2017"">107 TWh of renewable power annually</A>; around the same amount of electricity as consumed by The Netherlands.</P><P>While a recent report from CDP, tracking the emissions from supply chains found that leading suppliers disclosed reductions equivalent to <A href=""https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/001/500/original/CDP-Supply-chain-report-2017.PDF?1485248719"">434 million tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide</A> from reduction projects – greater than the annual emissions of France. This resulted in a reported $12.4 billion in savings, more than double the figure from 2015.</P><P><STRONG>Emission reductions are good for growth </STRONG></P><P>Emissions reductions not only help the bottom line through cost savings, but prove to be an engine for growth as well. </P><P><A href=""https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/001/228/original/CDP_<mark>Climate</mark>_Change_Report_2016.pdf?1485276095"">Extensive analysis of over 1,000 companies</A>, by CDP, highlights a core group of 62 companies that have achieved the elusive goal of delivering impressive and reliable revenue growth, while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.</P><P>Over a five-year period, the revenues of the businesses that managed decoupling grew by an average of 29% and their emissions fell by 26% overall; in contrast with those companies not achieving decoupling that saw revenue decline by 6% on average, while their GHG emissions grew by 6%.</P><P>Meanwhile, <A href=""https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/sites/default/files/The%20<mark>Climate</mark>%20Has%20Changed_1.pdf"">analysis by WMB in partnership with CDP</A> shows that companies taking <mark>climate</mark> action are outperforming their peers, and achieving an average Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 27%, with some US companies generating as much as 81% IRR on particular initiatives.</P><P><STRONG>It drives <mark>innovation</mark> and opens new markets  </STRONG></P><P>Setting ambitious goals to tackle <mark>climate change</mark> can drive <mark>innovation</mark> as companies look beyond established <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive business models. For example, the IKEA Group has turned energy from being a cost center into a profit center thanks to over 300 wind turbines across nine countries, and more than 700,000 solar panels. </P><P>Philips saw sales of its green products range jump 15% year on year in 2015, to reach a total of 52% of the company’s overall revenue, with low-<mark>carbon</mark> <mark>innovation</mark> driving sales across lighting, consumer lifestyle products and healthcare.    </P><P><STRONG>The economic opportunity is clear </STRONG></P><P>The scale of investment required to transition the global economy to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> future represents a huge opportunity for businesses able to harness the potential. Implementing the Paris Agreement will unlock at least $13.5 trillion of economic activity globally, <A href=""https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/sites/default/files/The%20Business%20End%20of%20<mark>Climate</mark>%20Change.pdf"">analysis by WMB</A> shows.</P><P>Of the $11.4 trillion set to be invested in power generation globally by 2040, $7.8 trillion will go to renewable energy, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""col-sm-4""><ASIDE id=""sidebar""><SECTION class=""side-block""><DIV class=""events-block""><H2>Events &amp; Webinars</H2></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class=""side-block""><ARTICLE class=""post video-post""><H2 class=""h3""><A href=""https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/blog/3-ways-businesses-can-show-governments-theyre-taking-action-<mark>climate</mark>/"">

Check out this video interview Terry Duncan, chief of consumer engagement at <A href=""http://automotivedigest.com/video/scooters-coming-to-america/"">Mahindra GenZe</A>, a US startup that has backing from India’s Mahindra. GenZe is rolling out an electric scooter in early 2014 targeted toward Millennials in the US. The product and audience was chosen based on two premises – urbanization is happening in the world’s major cities and transportation is being heavily impacted; Millennials in their late teens to early 30s are the right market to start with, since they’re not buying cars as much as previous generations, are moving to cities, and want functional, practical transportation alternatives. In another video, you’ll hear him discuss the design decisions made on the bike; while these types of vehicles have huge sales numbers in countries like China, they need to be extremely pragmatic and, let’s say, cool, to make it in the US.</P><P><B>Top News of the Week:</B></P><OL start=""1""><LI>A group of Chinese investors based on Hong Kong and led by Richard Li are <B>investing in Fisker Automotive</B> for an unreported amount.

A small chunk of the payback will come through <B>former GM vice chairman Bob Lutz</B>. VL Automotive, a small Detroit company that has Lutz’ backing, will be converting 25 unsold Karmas from plug-in hybrid power to Corvette power. VL had to settle a dispute with an Asian investor that had prevented them from accessing codes operating the car’s infotainment system. Lutz says these converted Karmas will come out in 2014 for something close to $200,000.</LI><LI><B>Clean­Fuel USA has installed 85 retail propane auto­gas fuel­ing sta­tions across 13 states.</B> This was funded by a $12 mil­lion grant from the US Depart­ment of Energy’s Amer­i­can Recov­ery and Rein­vest­ment Act.

General Motor's chief <mark>climate</mark> denier (he prefers <EM>skeptic</EM>) is finally on his way out the door.
</P><P>
GM just announced that it is retiring Bob Lutz as vice chairman for global product development. He'll be replaced on April 1 and fully retired at the end of the year – if GM lasts that long.
</P><P>
We hope Lutz is the last of <EM>that</EM> model to emerge from Detroit. Last year, <A href=""/blog/20081208/call-resignation-gms-lutz-too-condition-bailout"">we called for his resignation</A> as a condition of the Big Three bailout.
</P><P>
In his more than four decades in the auto business, Lutz earned the nickname &quot;Maximum Bob&quot; for pushing horsepower and a macho image of big trucks and fast cars with no thought to fuel efficiency or emissions. Worrying about the environment wasn't part of the equation for Lutz – until he was recently saddled with the Chevy Volt, GM's in-development electric car.
</P><P>
When Lutz began the public pitchman role for the Volt last year, <EM>The New York Times</EM> wrote: <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/19/business/19auto.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=robert%20a.%20lutz%20volt&amp;st=cse"">GM's Mr. Horsepower has an electric conversion</A>: &quot;The prospect of Mr. Lutz going green represents a sharp reversal.&quot; Lutz had regularly mocked environmental advocates, saying that except for &quot;a few nuts in California,&quot; no one cares about the impact cars have on the environment. Just this past December, he told Fox News: &quot;At $1.50 a gallon, <A href=""/blog/20081210/gm-vice-chairman-bob-lutz-american-public-wants-suvs"">the American public wants sport utilities and large pickup trucks.&quot;</A> Then there was his comment to a group of Texas journalists that global warming was <A href=""http://blog.wired.com/cars/2008/02/bob-lutz-global.html"">&quot;a crock of s---&quot;</A></P><P>
Here's how <A href=""http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2008/02/talk_about_a_cr.html"">Lutz responsed</A> to criticism of his &quot;crock&quot; comment:
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
	My beliefs are mine and I have a right to them, just as you have a right to yours. But among my strongest beliefs is that my job is to do what makes the most business sense for GM.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>
The man replacing Lutz is <A href=""http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3012/is_2_183/ai_97998456"">Tom Stephens</A>, GM's vice president of powertrains. He should be healthier for the company and hopefully for the planet, too. While Lutz was making fun of Toyota's hybrid Prius in the early 2000s, calling it a publicity stunt, Stephens was working on three new hybrid gas/electric powertrains for GM vehicles.
</P><P>
Stephens explained his hybrid strategy to the <A href=""http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060108/AUTO04/601080312/1364"">Detroit News</A> in 2006: &quot;I'm going after the highest-consuming vehicles first, because that's where the big payback is.&quot;
</P><P>
GM needs all the help it can get. Bloomberg reports today:
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
	<mark>General Motors Corp.</mark> and Chrysler LLC may have to be forced into bankruptcy by the U.S. government to assure repayment of $17.4 billion in federal bailout loans, a course of action the automakers claim would destroy them.

Lutz, meanwhile, will be out as head of global product development in seven weeks, but he'll stick around as a consultant through December. He talked about his departure on his blog this morning, under the headline, <A href=""http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2009/02/youre_not_rid_of_me_yet.html"">&quot;You're Not Rid of Me Yet&quot;:</A></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
	So I'll be around the rest of the year, helping with the transition and acting as senior adviser to [GM CEO] Rick Wagoner, and I'm sure you'll read further updates in this space about how it's going. Most importantly, I remain as confident as ever in the future of General Motors and the continued excellence of its products.

Using O.R. to meet auto industry challenges and provide value to customers and the company.</H3><DIV class=""attribute-body ezoe""><FIGURE class=""full-image primary-image"" style=""max-width:490px""><FIGURECAPTION class=""attribute-caption""><P>GM Chairman and CEO Dan Akerson (fourth row, third from left), GM CTO and Global R&amp;D Vice President Jon Lauckner (fourth row, fourth from left) and Global R&amp;D Executive Director Gary Smyth (top) with the GM R&amp;D Operations Research team.</P></FIGURECAPTION></FIGURE><H3>By Jonathan H. Owen, CAP, David J. Vander Veen and Lerinda L. Fros</H3><P>In today’s world, where globalization is a fact of business life, where competition is fiercely intense and where concerns such as energy security and <mark>climate change</mark> are global in scope, a science-based approach to decision-making and problem-solving is essential.</P><P>At General Motors, operations research provides that framework, particularly for complex issues and systems that involve multiple objectives, many alternatives, trade-offs between competing effects, large amounts of data and situations involving uncertainty or risk. In truth, for an entity the size of General Motors, these are the only kind of challenges the company faces because GM is huge and no issue is simple!</P><P>With products that range from electric and mini-cars to heavy-duty full-size trucks, monocabs and convertibles, GM offers a comprehensive range of vehicles in more than 120 countries around the world. Along with its strategic partners, GM sells and services vehicles under the Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac, Opel, Vauxhall, Holden, Baojun, Wuling and Jiefang brand names. GM also has significant equity stakes in major joint ventures in Asia, including SAIC-GM, SAIC-GM-Wuling, FAW-GM and GM Korea.</P><P>GM has 212,000 employees located in nearly 400 facilities across six continents. Its employees speak more than 50 languages and touch 23 time zones. The work they do demonstrates the depth and breadth of the auto business – from developing new vehicles and product technologies to designing and engineering state-of-the-art plants, organizing and managing the company’s vast global supply chain and logistics systems, building new markets and creating new business opportunities.</P><DIV class=""""><P class=""image-caption"" style=""width:575px"">Figure 1: GM vehicle brands.</P></DIV><P>The work is multifaceted, but whether in Detroit, Frankfurt, Sao Paulo or Shanghai, the goal is straightforward: offer products and services that establish and maintain a deep connection with customers around the world while simultaneously generating revenue and profit for the company.</P><P>Considering the complexity of the challenges in the auto business and the speed at which change is occurring in every arena – technology, business, materials and resources, governmental policies and regulations – it is critical to employ a scientific approach in thinking about and attempting to understand problems and implement viable solutions. Today, no area of GM is untouched by analytical methods.</P><H4>The Early Years</H4><P>Even before the industry entered the current period of globalization and profound technological change, operations research was valued within GM. As early as the 1960s and 1970s, GM employed analytical techniques for transportation studies and traffic flow analyses. In the 1980s, GM developed analytical principles and used mathematical optimization methods to improve assembly line job sequencing. In the 1990s, it patterned warranty cost reduction analyses after Centers for Disease Control epidemiology studies.</P><P>In 2005, GM won the Franz Edelman Award from INFORMS for its work on production throughput analysis and optimization. Even when overall industry production capacity is above demand, it is usually the case that demand for certain “hot” vehicles exceeds planned plant capacities. In such cases, an increase in production capacity will generate larger profits via more sales revenue and/or overtime cost avoidance.</P><P>GM’s operations research team analyzed production throughput using math models and simulation, identified cost drivers and bottlenecks, and developed a throughput improvement process to increase productivity and reduce costs. The resulting software has been enhanced over a 20-year period to extend GM’s capabilities, enabling it to accommodate product and manufacturing flexibility, variable control policies and more complex routing. The software is used globally in GM plants, as well as to design new production systems and processes.</P><P>This long-term effort is just one example that demonstrates how GM has applied O.R. methods to change the way it leverages operations research and advanced analytics on a continuing basis. The importance of activities like this in a company the size of GM cannot be fully measured. For plant throughput alone, the savings are estimated at more than $2 billion over the past two decades. But just as important as the economic benefits is the mindset – the scientific approach to problem-solving, decision-making, scheming the business, and identifying new opportunities.</P><DIV class=""""><P class=""image-caption"" style=""width:575px"">2014 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray.</P></DIV><H4>O.R. at GM Today</H4><P>Given the success of the work described above, the R&amp;D Operations Research team  broadened its mission about five years ago and today provides a research capability within the company focused on tackling long-term strategic challenges. With the wide-ranging scope of potential assignments, the O.R. team is composed of Ph.D. and master’s-level technical experts, along with subject-matter experts with hands-on and executive leadership experience in key areas of the business, such as manufacturing, supply chain, engineering, quality, planning, marketing, and research and development.</P><P>Projects are aligned with top company priorities, which are based on a combination of business performance drivers and senior leadership input. The work may start with targeted questions, e.g., what’s the opportunity of (fill in the blank), or it can focus on improving operational effectiveness through process improvements in areas such as manufacturing productivity, capital or supply chain management, or dealer inventory management. Many opportunities to improve revenue management exist through the application of tools and systems that help decision-makers optimize portfolio planning, reduce complexity, target incentives, or optimize content and packaging. In addition, given the large new data streams coming from the intelligence available in today’s vehicles, new emphasis is being put on improving vehicle efficiency, quality and diagnostics, as well as more deeply understanding customers so GM can provide differentiated value through new automotive products and services. The team’s implementation model comprises a mix of:</P><UL><LI>analysis by internal consultants to understand the issue,</LI><LI>capability development, including analytical principles, math models and tools, and</LI><LI>partnering with stakeholders and decision-makers early to scope and maximize the potential impact of implemented solutions.</LI></UL><H4>O.R. Drives Transformation</H4><P>The R&amp;D Operations Research team recently received two “teamGM Transformer” Awards for developing business tools that use “big data” and analytics to improve decision-making. This is an internal award that rewards employees who are leading change across the company by finding significant and innovative ways to drive GM business priorities.</P><P>One of the O.R. team’s Transformer Awards recognized new analytic tools to support GM’s Product Development activity. These include a range of tools that help guide engineering decisions to reduce complexity in the vehicle and powertrain, apply market research to vehicle attribute balancing and optimize portfolio planning in light of greenhouse gas performance objectives. The other award was for development of a new approach to optimizing inbound logistics. This tool is being expanded to support its use by all vehicle programs early in the vehicle development process.</P><P>With the exponential growth in data, the ever-expanding digital connection to customers and the introduction of exciting new vehicles technologies, this is an exciting time for operations research at GM. With so many research-rich opportunities, the team is always mindful of the characteristics that are key to successfully applying O.R. methods and achieving organizational excellence, including the ability to:</P><UL><LI>choose the right problem to address;</LI><LI>see and convince others that a complicated problem is important and solvable;</LI><LI>work as part of a team toward a common and well-defined goal;</LI><LI>have tenacity in chasing down details and data, and then equal tenacity in the implementation of a solution;</LI><LI>get the model to the right level of detail for the purpose at hand so it is not too complex, nor too data intensive, but sufficiently detailed to capture the salient characteristics and trade-offs;</LI><LI>engage the key stakeholders in the process of development and implementation, in order to gain joint ownership. Technology transfer is something that takes place between consenting adults; and</LI><LI>deliver an O.R. solution to decision-makers in a form or format that they can understand and act upon.</LI></UL><P>O.R. practitioners who embody these characteristics can have a profound impact on their organization, help their company rise above the competition, and most importantly provide increased value to customers. As the world goes global – as <mark>innovation</mark> strives to create more, faster, better and at less cost; as new business and technology paradigms emerge – endless opportunities abound to take advantage of operations research and reap the substantial good that can be realized from its practice.</P><P><I><B>Jonathan H.

As a result, GM recorded greenhouse gas emissions savings of 244,000 metric tons a year and cost savings of $287 million, according to CDP.</P><P>Companies like Wal-Mart, meanwhile, have aggressively adopted renewable energy to power retail stores and distribution centers, resulting in significant reductions in energy-related <mark>CO2</mark>. Wal-Mart is also collaborating with its large network of suppliers to collectively reduce 20 million metric tons of greenhouse gas from its supply chain by the end of 2015.</P><P>Paul Simpson, CDP's chief executive officer, said the index reinforces earlier reports from CDP and others showing that the world's largest private-sector companies are responding to the threats of <mark>climate change</mark>, even if governments have been slow to act.</P><P>&quot;The bottom line is at risk from the <mark>climate</mark> crisis,&quot; Simpson said in a statement. &quot;The unprecedented environmental challenges that we confront today are also economic problems. This irrefutable fact is filtering through to companies and investors.</P><P>&quot;However,&quot; he added, &quot;global emissions continue to rise at an alarming rate. Businesses and governments must raise their <mark>climate</mark> ambition. The data shows that there is neither an excuse nor the time for lethargy.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Leaders aim for big reductions</STRONG>
The 2014 results show that 9 percent of nearly 2,000 companies that responded to CDP requests for information on greenhouse gas emissions and other measures of <mark>climate change</mark> performance received the group's highest grade.</P><P>The leading firms represent a broad spectrum of the global economy, including <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive sectors such as oil and gas producers, electric utilities, and transportation firms, as well as makers of consumer goods, banking and financial institutions, health care companies, and information technology providers. A cigarette company also made the cut.</P><P>Collectively, the 187 <mark>climate</mark> performance leaders have reduced their total greenhouse gas emissions by 33 million metric tons in the past reporting year, roughly equivalent to removing all of London's cars from the road for 2½ years, according to CDP.</P><P>The IT sector was particularly well-represented by U.S. firms, with nine of the world's 30 best performers coming from the United States. In addition to perennial top performers like Google, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Cisco Systems, the new leadership index included lesser-known firms like Akamai Technologies Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based cloud services provider, and Juniper Networks Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., which provides computer network solutions in a variety of sectors.</P><P>Nicole Peill-Moelter, senior director for corporate sustainability at Akamai, said in a telephone interview that the company has committed to reducing its <mark>carbon</mark> intensity by 30 percent year over year through ongoing energy efficiency and server productivity initiatives, and that <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and energy consumption have remained largely flat even as the company has experienced significant growth in network traffic.</P><P>In the future, she said, Akamai is exploring ways to drive down emissions even further by collaborating with its data center providers to incorporate more renewable energy resources. She said the company was honored to be included in the CDP index &quot;alongside peers who have been leaders both inside and outside our sector in targeting <mark>climate change</mark>.&quot;</P><P>One of the more surprising entries on the <mark>carbon</mark> leadership index was Philip Morris International Inc., the tobacco giant that sells cigarettes and other products into 180 markets around the world.</P><P>While Philip Morris netted $20.8 billion in profits in 2013 by selling smokable tobacco products, the company has pledged to achieve a 20 percent reduction in <mark>CO2</mark> emissions from its manufacturing facilities along with a 30 percent <mark>CO2</mark> reduction across its entire value chain using a 2010 base line, according to its website. Roughly 40 percent of the company's <mark>carbon</mark> footprint is tied to the growing of tobacco, PMI said.</P><P>&quot;Our excellent results in this year's CDP Leaders Report are an important and welcome recognition of our efforts,&quot; the company's CEO, André Calantzopoulos, said in a statement.</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>wire with permission from Environment &amp; Energy Publishing, LLC. <A href=""https://www.eenews.net"" target=""_blank"">www.eenews.net</A>, 202-628-6500</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It said cars made by the six automakers account for more than 30 percent of human-generated <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions in California, the most populous U.S. state.  </P><P>“We understand why a district federal judge may not want to jump into a global warming thicket with both feet,” Ken Alex, California’s supervising deputy attorney general, said in an interview. “Having said that, the basic tenet of law is that where you describe a harm then there needs to be a remedy for it.”</P><P>“Right now because the political branches — the federal government, Congress and the executive branch — have not acted, the state of California is left without a remedy.”</P><P>Alex said his office would consider whether to appeal the case to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, saying judges frequently decided reasonable standards in cases such as dumping of <mark>pollution</mark> into rivers.  </P><P>According to the suit, California spends millions of dollars to deal with a reduced snow pack, beach erosion, ozone <mark>pollution</mark> and the impact on endangered animals and fish.  </P><P>California has also targeted the auto industry with first-in-the-nation rules adopted in 2004 requiring automakers to reduce emissions from cars and light trucks.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Why? Support for fighting <A href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""""><mark>climate change</mark></A> is in their own self-interest</P><P>Likely reasons for business' backing of the accord range from its public relations impact to the 195-nation pact's value in aiding particular business strategies, such as the energy supermajors' natural gas operations. &quot;If you were a large corporation, the herd instinct told you how to chime in&quot; on backing the international accord, said Bill McKibben, a Middlebury College professor and environmental advocate.</P><P>In announcing that the U.S. was pulling out of the Paris treaty on Thursday, Mr. Trump said it &quot;hamstrings the United States&quot; and would cost jobs in a host of industries such as coal and steel<STRONG>. </STRONG>The market reaction to Mr. Trump's speech from the White House Rose Garden was mixed. </P><P>Peabody Energy (<A href=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/arch/quote/"">BTU</A>), the largest coal company, was down 0.6 percent on Thursday, and No. 2 Arch Coal (<A href=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/arch/quote/"">ARCH</A>) rose almost 0.6 percent. The largest steel firm, Nucor (<A href=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/nue/quote/"">NUE</A>), advanced 1.7 percent.</P><P>Agreed to in 2015, with enthusiastic support from then-President Barack Obama, the deal committed signers to voluntarily reducing their greenhouse gas emissions in a bid to fight <mark>climate change</mark>.The U.S. is the world's second-largest producer of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, after China.</P><P>Mr. Trump's decision flew in the face of a vocal campaign by large companies to keep America in the agreement, and it sparked anger among some chief executives. &quot;<mark>Climate change</mark> is real,&quot; Jeff Immelt, CEO of General Electric (<A href=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/ge/quote/"">GE</A>), said in a tweet after the president's announcement. &quot;Industry must now lead and not depend on government.&quot;  </P><P>In the wake of Mr. Trump's speech, Elon Musk, head of electric-car maker Tesla (<A href=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/tsla/quote/"">TSLA</A>), resigned from the president's business advisory council. &quot;Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,&quot; he tweeted.Bob Iger, chief of Walt Disney (<A href=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/dis/quote/"">DIS</A>), followed suit in quitting the council over the Paris move.</P><P>The hundreds of big companies that backed staying with the Paris accord run the full range of business sectors. They included retailers like Walmart (<A href=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/wmt/quote/"">WMT</A>), tech giants such as Apple (<A href=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/aapl/quote/"">AAPL</A>), automakers like General Motors (<A href=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/GM/quote/"">GM</A>) and even the leading lights of the fossil fuel industry, notably Exxon Mobil (<A href=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/xom/quote/"">XOM</A>). </P><P>Recently, 25 large corporations took out full-page ads in newspapers urging Mr. Trump to stick with the <mark>climate</mark> pact. &quot;By expanding markets for innovative clean technologies, the agreement generates jobs and economic growth,&quot; it read. </P><P>And Darren Woods, CEO of Exxon, wrote a letter to the president arguing that staying in the agreement would ensure that &quot;the United States will maintain a seat at the negotiating table.&quot; At the company's shareholder meeting Wednesday, he said, staying in was vital &quot;to ensure a level playing field so that all energy sources and technologies are treated equitably.&quot; </P><P>&quot;I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,&quot; the president said. In Mr. Trump's estimation, the Paris plan would result in 2.7 million lost American jobs lost by 2025, which environmentalists deride as wrongheaded. </P><P>The American <mark>Sustainable</mark> Business Council, a group of mainly smaller companies, argues that plenty of jobs can be created without harming the environment. &quot;The value of Paris to businesses is the clear market signal that the future is in lower <mark>carbon</mark>, rather than a chaotic and un<mark>sustainable</mark> future of business disruptions from rising seas and changing weather patterns,&quot; the group's CEO, David Levine, said in a statement. &quot;Even U.S. presidents cannot turn back the clock on history.&quot;  </P><P>And indeed, <SPAN class=""link""><A href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-pulls-out-of-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-but-isnt-likely-to-spur-job-growth/"" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="""">employment in energy producers other than coal</A></SPAN> is surging. According to the <A href=""https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/01/f34/2017%20US%20Energy%20and%20Jobs%20Report_0.pdf"">U.S. Department of Energy</A> in a January report, solar has more than twice as many U.S. jobs than coal -- 374,000 versus 160,000.</P><P>Time was, of course, that Mr. Trump's stance was a widely held belief among American business leaders. They maintained that <mark>pollution</mark> reduction equaled job reduction. Things have changed as the public came to embrace many of environmentalists' tenets and started fearing man-made <mark>climate change</mark>.  </P><P>In fairness, there's no reason to question Corporate America's sincerity about fighting <mark>climate change</mark>. Company leaders want a livable world as much as anyone else. But business' advocacy for the Paris pact shows that, for a variety of reasons, support for fighting greenhouse gases now is in their own best bottom-line interest, as well. That's because:</P><P><STRONG>The accord isn't very radical.</STRONG> It legally requires no country to actually end greenhouse gas emissions.The agreement establishes loose and voluntary criteria to follow. In late 2015, every nation announced a nonbinding plan pledging to decrease the pumping of methane and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into the atmosphere. The accord's lack of hard mandates makes adhering to its benchmarks less than onerous.  </P><P>That's not to say the Paris deal is simply a feel-good exercise that will lead to no meaningful results. Fast-growing China, which has an enormous appetite for energy, has committed to weaning itself from rampant coal use because burning coal has led to an enormous <mark>pollution</mark> problem in Chinese cities. So Beijing plans to meet its targets under the Paris accord by ending construction of some 100 coal-fired electric power plants and shifting billions into vast  wind and solar projects.</P><P><STRONG>U.S. multinationals now will face a tougher time competing overseas.</STRONG> As the outliers in the international business community, American companies dread being at a disadvantage that may cost them sales. The 25-company ad calling on the president to stay with the <mark>climate</mark> deal contended that &quot;U.S. companies are well positioned to lead in these [overseas] markets. Withdrawing from the agreement will limit our access to them and could expose us to retaliatory measures.&quot; </P><P>By the same token, they're leery that the U.S. government won't be able to strike favorable trade compacts that will benefit American exporters.</P><P><STRONG>It's good P.R. to support the deal. </STRONG>About seven out of 10 registered voters, or 69 percent, say the U.S. should participate in the Paris agreement, compared with 13 percent who say that the country should not, according to a November 2016 poll by the Yale Program on <mark>Climate Change</mark> Communication. &quot;For consumer-facing companies in particular,&quot; said environmentalist McKibben, &quot;it's not popular to oppose the Paris agreement.&quot;</P><P>Certainly, backing the deal is good cover for the oil industry. Exxon, for instance, is fighting an investigation led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman that seeks to show that it and other energy behemoths are responsible for <mark>climate change</mark> and have covered up their culpability.  </P><P>In talking about the Trump White House, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, told CNBC Thursday that he &quot;never imagined&quot; an administration that's &quot;way to the right of Exxon on a fossil fuel issue.&quot; </P><P>While the National Mining Association, which lobbies for the coal industry, favored pulling out of the Paris framework, two coal companies opted for staying. Cloud Peak Energy and Peabody told the White House that remaining in the accord would foster U.S. coal sales to emerging markets that still want the fuel, news reports said. </P><P><STRONG>It helps gas producers and hurts coal. </STRONG>Exxon, for instance, is the nation's largest natural gas producer, and gas is displacing coal as the preferred power-generating fuel. Gas is cheaper to produce and cleaner. <A href=""https://www.aei.org/publication/exxonmobil-endorses-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-agreement/"">Benjamin Zycher</A>, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote that &quot;because the U.S. has a lot of cheap natural gas -- a substantial part of which is produced by ExxonMobil -- [the company] will have a competitive advantage within the agreement.&quot;  </P><P><STRONG>Polluting industries can carve out an exception for themselves.</STRONG> While GM and some other automakers have voiced various degrees of support for the Paris treaty, they still push back against stricter federal tailpipe emissions standards. This winter, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers wrote Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt to ask that he squelch Obama-issued emissions' rules. The trade group didn't respond to a request for comment about Mr. Trump's decision to exit the Paris accord.</P><P>Meanwhile, Exxon is under investor pressure to show it's aiding the anti-<mark>climate change</mark> efforts. On Wednesday, over 62 percent of <SPAN class=""link""><A href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/exxon-shareholders-<mark>climate</mark>-change-pressure/"" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="""">shareholders backed a nonbinding resolution</A></SPAN> requiring it to disclose the risks to its business from <mark>climate change</mark> and what policies it's following to mitigate them. Last year, only 38 percent had backed a similar motion.</P><P>Under CEO Woods, Exxon now has to decide what to do, and a spokesman indicated the board will look at the issue. The company said it already has spent nearly $8 billion in emissions-reduction technology and research on shifting to lower-<mark>carbon</mark> energy products and processes.</P><P>Mr. Trump characterized his decision as helping the forgotten men and women across this country. Some say that's not true. But along the way, he has evidently forgotten the U.S. business community. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""copyright"">© 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

CEOs at Ford, Goldman Sachs, Nike, and Starbucks spoke out against them.</P><P>When Indiana and North Carolina curbed anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, leaders of big companies strongly objected. PayPal <A href=""http://hrc-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com//files/assets/resources/NC_CEO_Letter_%283%29.pdf"">canceled plans</A> to expand in North Carolina, and the NBA moved its all-star game out of Charlotte.</P><P>But as President Trump prepares to back away from the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement, roll back the Obama administration’s signature <mark>climate change</mark> initiatives, and appoint an Environmental Protection Agency administrator who has repeatedly fought the agency, the leaders of corporate America have for the most part been muted or silent.</P><P>This poses a problem for environmentalists and their allies in Congress, particularly on the <mark>climate</mark> issue. </P><P>U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and a persistent advocate for <mark>climate change</mark> action, puts it this way: “One of the dirty secrets that we have to live with is that even the good-guy corporations don’t show up in Congress to lobby for doing something about <mark>climate change</mark>. Collectively, they do zero or less than zero to support <mark>climate</mark> legislation… That leaves the field to the bad guys.” </P><P>Without support from business, the environmental movement will struggle to defend itself against what David Goldston, director of government affairs for the Natural Resources Defense Council, calls an “incredible onslaught from both Congress and the administration.” What’s more, if environmentalists are to have any chance of convincing the federal government to enact stronger laws or regulations to curb <mark>climate change</mark> — a long shot, admittedly, for now — they will need big companies to use their political clout to turn around the Republicans who control Congress and the White House.</P><P>The reluctance of Fortune 500 companies to speak up on behalf of environmental protection is striking because it comes after decades of efforts by environmental nonprofits, ranging from The Nature Conservancy to Greenpeace, to develop partnerships with business. This work has paid off: Many companies have pledged to reduce their own <mark>carbon</mark> footprints, curb waste, and buy renewable energy. But few are willing to spend political capital on behalf of the environment.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">Why aren’t companies “speaking out more against the Trump administration’s ‘alternative facts’ on <mark>climate</mark>?”</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>The nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA is a case in point. “He’s not just bad on one thing,” says Fred Krupp, president of the business-friendly Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). “He’s bad on everything.” It’s the first time that EDF has campaigned against an EPA nominee, but the group has few business allies in the battle.</P><P>Tom Murray, an EDF vice president who works closely with business, says he hopes that “pragmatic business voices” will eventually step up to influence the Trump administration. “At this point, however, companies are hanging back on engaging in policy and politics,” he says. “Companies are trying to make sense of the new political landscape, concerned about becoming the president’s next social media target, and enticed by the potential of regulatory and tax reform.”</P><P>A business affiliate of the Natural Resources Defense Council called E2 (it stands for “environmental entrepreneurs”) did put together a letter from “<A href=""https://members.e2.org/jsp/controller?docName=petition(AlertPruittNomEPA)"">500 business leaders</A>” who oppose Pruitt, but the signatories include a registered nurse, a physical therapist, and not a single big-company CEO. </P><P>Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director, says big business needs to step up. “It simply makes no sense that big companies like Coke, Microsoft, Google, and other companies that care about and are doing great things with clean energy and sustainability aren’t speaking out more against the Trump administration’s ‘alternative facts’ on <mark>climate change</mark> and a national energy plan that will only increase our dependence on fossil fuels,” he says.</P><P>Worse, at least for environmentalists, some companies are actively turning against their erstwhile allies. Two days after Trump was elected, the Alliance of American Automobile Manufacturers, which represents Ford and General Motors, among others, urged the president’s transition team to roll back stringent fuel economy rules that were agreed to by the carmakers early in the Obama years. Environmentalists were stunned.</P><P>Says Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a nonprofit alliance of environmentalists and investors: “General Motors is doing a lot of good things on waste, they’re committed to 100 percent renewables, they’re supportive of the Paris talks. But on fuel economy standards, they like this new administration.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">In 2016, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google all donated more money to Republicans than Democrats.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>Meantime, as the political winds have shifted rightwards, so have campaign contributions from corporate political action committees (PACs). In 2016, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google — all of which had previously favored Democratic congressional candidates over Republicans — donated more money to Republicans than Democrats. Congressional Republicans have united to oppose plans to regulate the greenhouse gases that cause <mark>climate change</mark> since 2008.</P><P>All of this means that, when it comes to <mark>climate change</mark>, the loudest business voices in Washington belong to the fossil fuel industry and powerful trade associations, notably the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, that have staunchly opposed <mark>climate</mark> regulation. The chamber’s board includes executives from Accenture, Allstate Insurance, AT&amp;T, Caterpillar, Dow Chemical, FedEx, Florida Power &amp; Light, and Pfizer, all of which have pledged to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions. Public pension funds and so-called socially responsible investors have <A href=""http://www.ott.ct.gov/PolicyAndEducation/LettertoCompaniesAddressing<mark>Climate</mark>Change.pdf"">called on chamber members</A> to “address any misalignment between their own positions and actions on <mark>climate change</mark> and their funding of the chamber’s actions,” to little apparent effect.</P><P>To be sure, some big companies have backed up their <mark>climate change</mark> rhetoric with action in Washington. In 2009, Apple left the U.S. chamber over its <mark>climate change</mark> position and Nike resigned from the chamber board, citing the <mark>climate</mark> issue. Last year, Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft filed a legal brief in federal court supporting the EPA’s Clean Power Plan. General Mills, Mars, and Starbucks have lobbied side-by-side with Ceres on <mark>climate</mark> issues. </P><P>Since the election, Ceres, World Wildlife Fund, and a group called We Mean Business recruited a large number of small companies and a small number of large ones — Campbell Soup, DuPont, Gap, General Mills, HP, Intel, Kellogg, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mars, Mondelez, Monsanto, Staples, Starbucks, and Unilever, among them — to <A href=""http://www.low<mark>carbon</mark>usa.org/"">sign a letter</A> asking the new administration to affirm its commitment to the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement. Yet without further action at the state or federal level, the U.S. will probably fall short of meeting the <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> target that it agreed to in Paris, <A href=""https://phys.org/news/2016-09-track-<mark>carbon</mark>-<mark>pollution</mark>-goal.html"">experts say</A>.</P><P>Companies contacted by <EM>Yale Environment 360</EM> declined to discuss their Washington lobbying, campaign contributions, or trade association memberships. In a statement, Google explained its donations to Republican <mark>climate</mark> skeptics by saying: “Google engages on a wide variety of public policy issues and we work with policymakers and advocacy groups across the political spectrum. We’re never going to agree 100% with every organization or policymaker on every issue.” </P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">Corporations do not want to become a target of a president who is willing to call out individual companies by name.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>Gary Garfield, who recently retired as CEO of Bridgestone Tire, is one chief executive who did step up, wrangling senior executives in the tire industry to call for strong <mark>climate</mark> action. But he says environmental issues aren’t a priority for many CEOs because, unlike immigration or gay rights, they do not directly affect company employees. CEOs don’t want to unnecessarily aggravate political allies, shareholders, or employees over an issue that “doesn’t really directly affect their business,” he notes.
  </P><P>The Trump presidency complicates the calculus for businesses that need to manage an array of Washington issues, insiders say. “Companies absolutely care about <mark>climate change</mark>, but they care about other things too,” says Ceres’ Lubber. “They are balancing and juggling.” Corporations want Trump and the Republican Congress to support corporate tax cuts and infrastructure spending, and they do not want to become a target of a president who has been willing to call out individual companies by name. 
  </P><P>“Companies see a bully in the schoolyard, and they are off in the corner, doing their homework, and hoping the bully picks on someone else,” says Aron Cramer, the president and CEO of BSR, a network of businesses dedicated to sustainability. But, he says, business leaders understand the importance of <mark>climate policy</mark>, and they will speak up: “The underlying fundamentals will cause business to sustain their <mark>climate</mark> commitments and ultimately to be more vocal about those commitments.”
  </P><P>As with all things <mark>climate</mark>-related, there isn’t a lot of time to waste.</P></DIV></SECTION></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The floodwaters have since receded, but the images of upheaval remain etched in our collective memory. Recovery will take years, perhaps decades, and it will cost billions of dollars.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>Experts tell us that warming oceans are causing hurricanes to become <A href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/09/05/global-warming-make-powerful-hurricanes-more-likely-scientists-say/Q3lUW6iKuGEKvpTOD22sGL/story.html"">more powerful</A>, and other consequences of anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> – from <A href=""http://www.fao.org/emergencies/crisis/drought-hoa/en/"">severe droughts</A> in the Horn of Africa to <A href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-floods-bangladesh-nepal-deaths-millions-homeless-latest-news-updates-a7919006.html"">extreme flooding</A> in Asia – are leaving millions without food and basic shelter. But while the link between burning fossil fuels and deadly weather has been <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-7.html"">strengthening for years</A>, policymakers have not always heeded the warnings.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>This is changing rapidly. Today, countries, citizens, and a growing number of businesses around the world are finally taking action. This month, thousands gathered for the UN’s <A href=""http://unfccc.int/meetings/bonn_nov_2017/meeting/10084.php""><mark>climate change</mark> conference</A> in Bonn, Germany, to ratchet up global ambition in the fight against <mark>climate change</mark>. Following the successful <A href=""http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php"">Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement</A> two years ago, expectations for further progress and continued collaboration are high.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>One of the more promising recent initiatives is the <A href=""http://www.<mark>carbon</mark>pricingleadership.org/""><mark>Carbon</mark> Pricing Leadership Coalition</A> (CPLC), which brings together 30 governments and more than 180 businesses and strategic partners to put a value on <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions. The idea is simple: if we are to meet the Paris accord’s target of limiting the increase in global average temperature to less than 2° Celsius above preindustrial levels – ideally, to 1.5° above preindustrial levels – we must dramatically cut emissions. As <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>pricingleadership.org/governance/"">co-chairs of the CPLC</A>, we believe that one of the best ways to do that is by shifting the social and economic costs of heat-trapping gases from the public to the polluter.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>With the sense of <mark>climate</mark> urgency increasing, it is no longer acceptable to pollute for free and pass the bill to future generations. Putting a price on <mark>carbon</mark> is the most efficient way to reduce global emissions while encouraging <mark>sustainable</mark> and robust economic growth. Moreover, by putting a price on <mark>pollution</mark>, governments can generate revenue for investments like clean energy, schools, and health care, making it a double win.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>The ultimate goal, of course, is to encourage businesses to clean up their acts, and today, a growing share of business leaders understand that pricing <mark>carbon</mark> is one of the best ways to combat <mark>climate change</mark>. They also recognize that their businesses can thrive even as they work to reduce emissions.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>In fact, many business leaders are among the most enthusiastic supporters of effective <mark>carbon</mark> pricing. Just last month, the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project <A href=""https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/738/original/Putting-a-price-on-<mark>carbon</mark>-CDP-Report-2017.pdf?1507739326"">revealed</A> that the number of companies with plans to pursue internal <mark>carbon</mark> price mechanisms has grown to almost 1,400 globally, up from 150 in 2014. This includes more than 100 of the world’s largest companies, with total annual revenues of some $7 trillion. Royal DSM (which is led by one of the authors) has set a <A href=""http://annualreport.dsm.com/ar2016/en_US/5-letter-from-the-ceo.html""><mark>carbon</mark> price of €50 ($59) per ton</A>, joining other global companies like Michelin, Danone, and General Motors in applying meaningful <mark>carbon</mark> prices to “<A href=""http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2016/06/01/dutch-company-royal-dsm-prices-<mark>carbon</mark>-to-future-proof-its-business"">future-proof</A>” their business.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>Some 40 countries – including Canada – are also putting a price on <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>, and more governments are planning to implement similar schemes soon. In 2015, China announced plans to create the world’s largest <mark>carbon</mark>-pricing system. And earlier this year, Ontario, Québec, and California <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>pricingleadership.org/news/2017/9/12/ontario-california-quebec?rq=quebec"">signed an agreement</A> to create the world’s second-largest <mark>carbon</mark> market.</P></DIV><FIGURE class=""st__content-block st__content-block--image""><DIV class=""image__credit"">

To reduce greenhouse-gas emissions further and foster economic vitality, we must improve public transportation; construct energy-efficient buildings; and support efforts by businesses, innovators, and investors to develop clean-energy solutions. This is what Canada is already doing, because we know that these policies can reduce emissions and help create new, well-paying jobs.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>As is often said, <mark>climate change</mark> represents both a challenge and an opportunity. By pricing <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> and harnessing our collective abilities, we can address the former and seize the latter.

It turns out that from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/15092015/Exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming"">Exxon funded its own scientists</A> to engage in serious research on <mark>climate change</mark>, who concluded that burning fossil fuels was contributing to <mark>climate change</mark>, with potentially dire environmental consequences. </P><P>Back in July 1977, a senior Exxon scientist reported to the management committee that</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>there is general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global <mark>climate</mark> is through <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>By 1980, Exxon had assembled a high-level team of scientists to engage in cutting-edge research and <mark>climate</mark> modeling. The results, which were never released publicly, broadly affirmed the conclusions of the wider scientific community regarding the dangers of greenhouse gases. </P><P>These revelations raise <A href=""http://shadowproof.com/2015/09/23/exxon-cant-explain-shift-from-<mark>climate</mark>-science-to-<mark>climate</mark>-denial-funding/"">interesting questions</A> about Exxon’s metamorphosis and cast an even more cynical light on its corporate campaign against <mark>carbon</mark> regulation. Yet despite the substantial <A href=""http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/a-deep-dive-into-what-exxon-knew-about-global-warming-and-when-1978-it-knew-it/"">media attention</A> to this story, there has been little discussion of the role Exxon’s scientists themselves played in shaping the oil giant’s public position on <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>Our research, published three years ago, provides some valuable context. We <A href=""http://www.academia.edu/1333801/Corporate_Perceptions_of_<mark>Climate</mark>_Science_The_Role_of_Corporate_Environmental_Scientists"">interviewed</A> scientists and managers in the auto business, another industry that would be deeply affected by tight controls on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. </P><P>We found that the role of corporate scientists varied across companies and played an important role in crafting their companies’ stance on <mark>climate change</mark>, even as the companies – and the scientists – felt business pressures. Some scientists sought to advance <mark>climate</mark> science by engaging with the broader scientific community – as Exxon initially did – and even became champions for corporate action to address <mark>climate change</mark>. Others focused internally, screening external science and emphasizing the views of <mark>climate</mark> skeptics in internal briefings and reports. </P><H2>Shifting gears from air pollutants</H2><P>In an ideal world, objective science would drive public policy as well as corporate strategy; concerns about greenhouse gases would prompt government regulations and companies would respond by investing in low-<mark>carbon</mark> products and technologies. There are, however, <A href=""http://www.sciencetechnologystudies.org/"">complex social and political processes</A> that mediate between science and policy. </P><P>Our research focused on the organizational and business factors that shape corporate responses to <mark>climate change</mark>, particularly the role of their own internal scientists. </P><P>This is an important question since fossil fuel-related companies play a key role in the <A href=""http://www.academia.edu/948430/Private_Sector_Governance_for_a_<mark>Sustainable</mark>_Economy_A_Strategic_Approach"">governance of our energy system</A> and the sustainability of our planet.

There had been <A href=""http://web.atmos.ucla.edu/%7Ebrianpm/download/charney_report.pdf"">earlier studies</A> on <mark>climate change</mark>, but none had the media impact of Hansen’s testimony, which emphasized the immediacy and dangers of <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>Managers and scientists at Ford and General Motors (GM) told us that Hansen’s testimony catapulted <mark>climate change</mark> onto corporate radar screens. One manager described his shock at how quickly “<mark>climate</mark> went from zero to sixty.” The same month, a <A href=""http://news.utoronto.ca/toronto-conference-changing-atmosphere-25-years-later"">Toronto conference</A> on the changing atmosphere called for a 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2005. </P><P>Auto company managers had some reason to expect quick action on <mark>climate</mark>. Scientific discovery of the Antarctic ozone “hole” in 1984 had rapidly led to the Montreal Protocol in 1987, an international agreement that phased out ozone-depleting gases. The auto industry, along with other <mark>carbon</mark>-intense sectors, saw this as an ominous precedent. Hansen’s popularization of <mark>climate</mark> science, paradoxically, helped to spark business mobilization to challenge the science.</P><P>At the time, all the major US automobile companies questioned mainstream <mark>climate change</mark> research and advocated a “wait and see” policy, though they did so with differing intensity. GM was the only US company to refrain from strong direct attacks on the science, and GM later led the US industry in developing the first commercial electric vehicle, the ill-fated EV1. </P><P>In contrast, Ford CEO Alex Trotman was especially vociferous in the early 1990s, castigating those concerned with <mark>climate change</mark> and emphasizing the high cost of precipitate action. The suspicion of the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) science reports permeated through the organization, and one Ford manager expressed a common concern that: “The IPCC is the politics of science, not the science of science.”</P><H2>Inherent tensions</H2><P>Both Ford and GM had teams of internal scientists whose primary research focus was smog-forming air pollutants such as SOx, NOx, and particulates. As early as the 1970s, both had allocated a few scientists to track <mark>climate change</mark>, though unlike Exxon, they did not invest heavily in primary research. Rather, they served to scan and interpret the developing science at universities and governmental research centers.</P><P>Our interviews revealed the tensions inherent on the boundary between the worlds of academia and industry. Corporate scientists strive to adhere to the norms of objectivity and free investigation while also feeling the business pressures of bottom-line accountability in hierarchical, profit-driven corporations. </P><P>One manager we interviewed remarked that scientists who work closely with product operations are under “social pressure…they are around people who don’t pay attention to the <mark>climate</mark> issue and don’t want to hear it.”</P><FIGURE class=""align-center zoomable""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">General Motors’ 1991 EV1 – an all-electric car that won rave reviews, but the company gave it tepid support and the cars and program were eventually scrapped.</SPAN><SPAN class=""attribution""><A class=""source"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/rightbrainphotography/2224097814/in/photolist-goXcy-4ox5N3-4d4Pdx-4owRsm-4osJjB-4osKU6-4osNZr-4oxaHw-4owRgA-4osLhv-4osPk4-4owRBW-4owMTy-4owNRW-4owSjJ-4d8QdQ-4rbQYm-4ot4gZ-4d4Pan-4osGwD-4owPbJ-4osDup-4osGiR-4owKAY-ayozy4-4owToE-4owPtW-4owSf5-4owSDA-4osHC2-4osLDn-4owQUS-4osHLB-rk9xrD-4ot8xM-4owRmN-4osHHg-4osHxV-4osMBP-u4ypJR-BcqND-4osJBt-4owMNN-4orWX2-4ovSEQ-Bcqxt-cdq65u-bW3KGr-cdq5rN-cdq55E"">rightbrainphotography/flickr</A>, <A class=""license"" href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"">CC BY-SA</A></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>We found that a key difference between Ford and GM was where corporate scientists stood on the boundary between the scientific community and the company.

Initially a <mark>climate</mark> skeptic, she became a strong internal advocate and in 1985 organized a large internal GM conference, to which external scientists – but no skeptics – were invited to give presentations. Product managers from GM’s relatively autonomous divisions were asked to speak about how their strategies might impact greenhouse gas emissions. </P><P>Ford, by contrast, was a much more centralized company, with tight control from top management over product and political strategy. The Ford scientists assigned to track <mark>climate change</mark> were relatively insulated from the external <mark>climate</mark> science community, and tended to filter the scientific findings by downplaying the growing evidence for <mark>climate change</mark>.  When external scientists were invited, for example, they were usually skeptics.</P><H2>Change of plans at Exxon</H2><P>Exxon’s investment into <mark>climate</mark> science during the early 1980s appears to have taken place in a context similar to that in GM. <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/15092015/Exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming"">The ICN investigation</A> found that they brought in outside specialists who collaborated with university and government scientists, in a corporate culture that allowed them independence from commercial pressures and encouraged management to monitor long-term risks.  </P><P>Henry Shaw, Exxon’s lead <mark>climate</mark> scientist at the time, was seeking scientific legitimacy to influence debates. In a 1978 letter, he wrote: “This team must be recognized for its excellence in the scientific community, the government, and internally by Exxon management.”</P><P>By the 1990s, though, Exxon was a very different company. In <A href=""https://www.academia.edu/947921/Strategic_Responses_to_Global_<mark>Climate</mark>_Change_Conflicting_Pressures_on_Multinationals_In_the_Oil_Industry"">research on the oil majors</A> in the US and Europe together with Dr Ans Kolk of the University of Amsterdam, we found that Exxon was much closer to Ford in the orientation of its <mark>climate</mark> science group. </P><P>Exxon’s <mark>climate</mark> strategy team was led by Brian Flannery, a respected astrophysicist recruited from Harvard. He was a <mark>climate</mark> skeptic, however, who was less engaged with the mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science community, and used his scientific legitimacy to influence internal Exxon management as well as craft the external denial campaign. </P><FIGURE class=""align-center zoomable""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">Current Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson has shown little interest in renewable energy as a business and has said it’s very likely society can adapt to the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</SPAN><SPAN class=""attribution""><A class=""source"" href=""https://www.masterresource.org/exxon-mobil/exxon-mobil-trumps-alarmists/"">Reuters</A></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Exxon’s strategy process became increasingly centralized under CEO Lawrence Rawl and later Lee Raymond, leaving little room for consideration of alternative scenarios – for example, that concerns about <mark>climate change</mark> would lead to significant regulatory and reputational risks to the business. Shell’s legendary strategic planning process, by contrast, explicitly challenges management to consider scenarios that entail major social, environmental and economic trends.  </P><P>It was around this time, during the late 1980s, that the company shifted its strategy. Instead of continuing to invest in its own scientific expertise on <mark>climate change</mark> to gain external credibility, the company defunded the program, shifted to <mark>climate</mark> denial, and deployed its lobbying and public relations machine to influence policymakers. One Exxon manager told us that “(policymakers) cannot ignore us anyway; we are the big elephant at the table.” </P><P>The rising fear of <mark>carbon</mark> regulation was most likely an important factor that led to the clamp-down on Exxon’s independent <mark>climate</mark> science initiative in the late 1980s. But our many interviews with corporate managers and scientists convinced us that their perspectives on <mark>climate change</mark> were not purely strategic and driven by corporate interests; the scientists were also strongly influenced by organizational structures and culture, and in turn, they had an important influence on management thinking and company strategy. </P><P>In recent years, Exxon has moderated its position and in 2007 announced that it was abandoning support for <mark>climate</mark> denial groups, though it has <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/15/exxon-mobil-gave-millions-<mark>climate</mark>-denying-lawmakers"">continued to oppose</A> most forms of <mark>carbon</mark> regulation. Like other oil companies, <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>inc.org/2009/12/unleashing-exxon/"">Exxon has diversified</A> into natural gas and invested in biofuels, hedging its bets on the future. Exxon’s <A href=""http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/current-issues/<mark>climate</mark>-policy/<mark>climate</mark>-policy-principles/overview"">website now acknowledges</A> a need to put “policies in place that start the world on a path to reduce emissions while recognizing that addressing GHG emissions is one among other important world priorities, such as economic development, poverty eradication and public health.”  </P><P>One can only wonder what path Exxon might have taken if Exxon’s internal scientists had remained more engaged in the larger scientific community and less influenced by business pressures.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Cases such as <EM>Kivalina v. ExxonMobil</EM>, and <EM>California v. <mark>General Motors Corpo</mark>ration </EM>faced significant obstacles based in tort legal doctrine and were ultimately unsuccessful in establishing liability. In the article cited below, the authors (Marjanac and Patton) suggest a second wave of <mark>climate change</mark> litigation is waiting to happen due to the advances in a new area of science called &quot;extreme weather attribution science.&quot; </P><P>At Praedicat, we spend a great deal of time analyzing and modeling &quot;general causation,&quot; which we affectionately call GC and have developed a quantitative score to measure it. GC addresses whether a harm alleged in litigation can, in principle, have been caused by the defendant's action. By &quot;in principle,&quot; we mean &quot;by science,&quot; so in other words, do scientists believe that it is possible that the defendant's action could have caused the plaintiff's harm? On <mark>climate change</mark>, the general causation question is could <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, in principle, have caused the <mark>climate</mark> harm in question, such as wildfires. Increasingly, the GC questions for <mark>climate change</mark> are settled (at least among scientists). <mark>Carbon</mark> emission can increase the likelihood of wildfires, or hurricanes, or coastal flooding, and many other harms. (At Praedicat, we don't yet search and score these literatures since we focus on bodily injury and bioscience, but stay tuned!)   </P><P>The problem in <mark>climate change</mark> litigation, though, is frequently not general causation, but specific causation. Specific causation goes a step further than GC and says that this specific plaintiff's harm was caused by this specific defendant's product or action. Sometimes, the plaintiff is helped by the fact that he or she may have a &quot;signature disease,&quot; which is only caused by the product in question. In asbestos, for instance, mesothelioma is the &quot;signature disease&quot; of asbestos. In contrast, if a wildfire consumes a house, we might be comfortable with the idea that <mark>carbon</mark> emissions increase the risk of wildfire, but it is another thing altogether to say that wildfires are exclusively caused by <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. This will make <mark>climate change</mark> litigation over wildfires challenging for the plaintiffs.  </P><P>Extreme weather attribution science looks to change this. It seeks to find the signature diseases of <mark>carbon</mark> emission. The article cites the example of unprecedented heat waves, such as occurred in Asia in 2016 resulting in hundreds of deaths, where the weather pattern is outside the feasible range of natural variability. If the courts accept this kind of evidence, there will still be other significant challenges to establishing liability, but the prospects for <mark>climate change</mark> litigation will be much better than they were in the &quot;first wave.&quot;  </P></DIV><DIV class=""quote-container clearfix""><DIV class=""curly-brace"" role=""presentation"">{</DIV><DIV class=""quote"" itemprop=""citation"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/CreativeWork""><P class=""quote-text"" itemprop=""text""><mark>Climate change</mark> has additional hurdles, primarily in relation to establishing a duty of care, as well as standing and justiciability issues, which led to the early dismissal of the majority of tort-based claims against major emitters and producers of greenhouse gases.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Lots of companies make money in these sectors, and many more governments, institutions, and individuals consciously commit resources to these efforts. And while it’s important to have federal policy working in favor of these new technologies and the ongoing energy revolution, Trump’s decision won’t alter the structural forces that are propelling the daily progress of green investments and the ongoing revolution in electricity production. The planet doesn’t need the United States’ official buy-in to confront <mark>climate change</mark>.</P></DIV><DIV class=""tablet-ad""><SPAN class=""adv""> Advertisement </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""text-11 text parbase section""><P>Here’s why.</P></DIV><DIV class=""pullquotebox section""><ASIDE class=""pullquote""><P class=""quote"">There’s a structural issue that Trump can’t reverse: Cleaner forms of electricity are cheaper.</P></ASIDE></DIV><DIV class=""text-12 text parbase section""><P>Trump’s move would only affect the U.S. And while America’s largest companies may be domiciled in the United States, they have to worry about meeting standards across the globe. The U.S. has about 4 percent of the world’s population and accounts for about 25 percent (and falling) of global economic output. That’s huge. But with every passing year, our economic influence wanes as a global customer and a global producer. Trump may want to give U.S. companies a license to pollute more or tell U.S. automakers that they don’t have to bother meeting aggressive mileage standards. And they may take him up on it. But if a U.S. automaker wants to sell cars in Europe (whose economy is roughly the size of the ours) or China (which is getting there), it will likely have to develop vehicles that can run farther on batteries and guzzle less gas. (General Motors already sells fewer cars in the U.S. than it does in China.) The global case for ironing emissions out of transportation is growing in urgency, not declining. India, population 1.3 billion, is <A href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2017/04/30/indias-ambitious-target-for-only-electric-cars-by-2030-stern-v-nordhaus-all-over-again/#1a03454e35a8"">making noises</A> about banning gasoline-fueled vehicles from its roads by 2030.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text-13 text parbase section""><P>The same dynamic holds on the consumer side. Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, and many other consumer-facing brands get the lion’s share of their revenues, and virtually all their growth, from overseas. For the sake of their brands, and simply to maintain their social license to operate around the globe, they have to remain committed to sustainability. Regardless of what Trump does, they’ll have to figure out how to comply with stringent <mark>carbon</mark> or emissions limits in overseas markets. They’ll start doing it because it is necessary for their brand, and they’ll keep doing it because it turns out that many of these initiatives are good for their bottom line. And Trump’s action won’t change that.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text text-14 parbase section""><P>Even in the absence of aggressive national targets, the case for cleaner (or cleaner-burning) fuels remains intact. For the last several years, utilities have been planning—and executing those plans—to lessen their reliance on coal and increase their reliance on natural gas and renewables. Utilities make investment decisions for 20, 30, and 40 years, not for the four or eight years of a Trump presidency. States, whether it is California acting on its own or the northeastern members of the <A href=""https://www.rggi.org/"">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</A>, are placing significant pressure on the power industry to reduce emissions. Trump’s move won’t cause utilities to rewrite their Integrated Resource Plans. Nor will it stop them from canceling plans to shutter coal-fired plants. This week’s coal-plant closures in New Jersey will certainly not be the last.</P></DIV><DIV class=""tablet-ad""><SPAN class=""adv""> Advertisement </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""text text-15 parbase section""><P>And that’s because of another structural issue that Trump can’t reverse: cleaner forms of electricity are cheaper. As Trump adviser Gary Cohn recently <A href=""http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/26/investing/trump-cohn-coal-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal/"">said</A>, “Coal doesn’t even make that much sense anymore as a feedstock.” The U.S. has abundant (read: cheap) supplies of natural gas. And the renewables sector, a cottage industry only a decade ago, has blossomed into an industrial powerhouse—one now possessing an enormous lobbying punch. Again, on a pure cost basis, even with the modest subsidies renewables enjoy wind and solar is often cheaper than coal. Should Trump pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, companies, utilities, and universities will continue to invest in wind and solar.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-16 section""><P>Finally, there’s the power of the American consumer. Polls show that Americans, by large margins, <A href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/190010/concern-global-warming-eight-year-high.aspx"">believe that <mark>climate change</mark> is real</A> and <A href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/05/most-americans-support-staying-in-the-paris-agreement/528663/"">want the government to do something about it</A>. They’re less likely than companies to put their money where their mouths are, in part because it’s money and in part because options just haven’t existed. But that may be changing. There are more than 1 million solar installations in the United States, many on the roofs of people’s homes. Sales of the Bolt have been modest, but overall sales of plug-ins and plug-in hybrids have been growing rapidly. And if Tesla gets its act together, it could easily sell a couple of hundred thousand Model 3s this year.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-17 section""><P>So, yes, it would be problematic and depressing if the U.S. were to join Nicaragua and Syria in not being part of the <mark>climate</mark> accord. And if this withdrawal were to be followed by seven years of federal policymaking that is hostile to sustainability and renewables, it would be an even bigger problem.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-18 section""><P>But it’s too soon to write an epitaph for the big business of sustainability.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><FOOTER><SECTION class=""about-the-author multi""><DIV class=""author-bio""><P>Daniel Gross is a longtime <I><B>Slate</B></I> contributor.

Walmart, Apple, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson, General Motors, Starbucks have all voiced their support for the accord. There are many more on that list, including Mars, Incorporated. Think Milky Way, Snickers, M&amp;M's, lots of Pedigree pet food.</P><P>Andy Pharoah is the company's vice president of corporate affairs and joins me now in the studio. Good to see you.</P><P>ANDY PHAROAH: Good evening.</P><P>SIEGEL: Your reaction to the president's announcement today and the company's reaction?</P><P>PHAROAH: Our reaction is that this <mark>climate change</mark> is a real threat to the world. The science is clear. Human activity is causing a problem. And the Paris Agreement is a good agreement. We're sticking by it. Many other businesses are sticking by it, and governments throughout the world are sticking by it. It's an important issue that we need to take action on.</P><P>SIEGEL: What will that mean for Mars to stick by it despite the U.S. withdrawing from it?</P><P>PHAROAH: We take a pragmatic and a principled view on this. If we look at our food business, our pet care business, our chocolate business - if we look through our supply chain, we see that <mark>climate change</mark> causes a real threat to that and a real threat to the communities in which we work and in the small farmers who we rely on to bring the products you love.</P><P>We also take a very principled view on it, which is when we look at the harm it will do to those communities. And we know that human activity is causing a problem, and we know it's solvable, that we can do things about it. Then it's the right thing to do, and it's important that companies do what is right.</P><P>SIEGEL: President Trump describes the Paris Agreement as something that costs the U.S. jobs, costs U.S. consumers money. Is that true for Mars? That is, does adhering to the agreement make your products more expensive and make it harder to expand or employ more people?</P><P>PHAROAH: No. In fact, you know, we're a growing company within the U.S. We've added many, many thousands of jobs. We've cut our emissions - greenhouse gas emissions - by 25 percent since 2010. And in the U.S. now, we are only using renewable energy. So anything you buy from us will be, in the U.S., made with renewable energy.</P><P>SIEGEL: And are you doing that as a point of principle, or is renewable energy - does it check out now economically for Mars?</P><P>PHAROAH: Yeah, it makes economic sense for us now. And also, you've got to think that in the future, <mark>carbon</mark> is going to have an economic price to it. And if you can build a company based on low <mark>carbon</mark>, you put yourself into a strong position. That's why you see all the old companies speaking out on this. That's why you see investment firms investing in the low-<mark>carbon</mark> future.</P><P>SIEGEL: And you're thinking not just about the U.S. economy but operating in a global economy.</P><P>PHAROAH: Absolutely. And we operate throughout the world.</P><P>SIEGEL: You know, we used to look at the list of corporations that have come out in support of the Paris agreement. And we saw them as the biggest critics of government regulations and very often resistant to changes like environmental regulations. What's happened? I mean Mars was 1 of 25 companies to sign a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal today urging President Trump to rethink the Paris Agreement. How did it turn out that big business became at least divided, if not pro-Paris Agreement?</P><P>PHAROAH: I think business actually has supported sensible regulation for a long time. And it believes - I think we believe that there's certain things companies can individually do. There are things that consumers can do, and there are things that governments can do. And we all need to work together on that, you know? A world of no regulation works for no one.</P><P>SIEGEL: Well, let's say that for the next few years, the federal government isn't in any way prodding us business or businesses that are based here to be greener. Does the market do it? Would Mars be encouraged just by market forces to continue to become more environmentally conscious?</P><P>PHAROAH: We've already made our decision on it. We know we need - this is action that we need to take. We're committed to taking it. I think the market will send signals. Consumers send signals. Customers send signals. So I think perhaps the most important thing about today is it isn't actually going to change what many businesses do, what many consumers do and what many governments do around the world.</P><P>SIEGEL: Should one read in that that perhaps the agreement itself has been oversold, that it doesn't do that much? Even if you pull out of it, it doesn't...</P><P>PHAROAH: I think directionally, it's important. Paris was a good agreement. It's heading in the right direction, and you know, we are fully supportive of it.</P><P>SIEGEL: Andy Pharoah, vice president of corporate affairs and strategic initiatives at Mars, Incorporated, thanks.</P><P>PHAROAH: Thank you.</P><P class=""disclaimer"">Copyright © 2017 NPR.

	Look, if it was any other issue, it would be a no-brainer for politicians all along the ideological spectrum. In almost every other area, society works on something like a “You break it. You buy it.” principle where those responsible for damaging something are the ones responsible for the tab. Except, it seems, when it comes to the <mark>climate</mark> crisis.
</P><P>
	Sure, <mark>climate change</mark> is an enormous and complex problem. One without any single silver bullet solution. But we know that some pretty basic and commonsense policy tools like <mark>carbon</mark> pricing – if done right and fairly – can make a real dent in emissions and trigger exactly the kind of broader cultural changes we need if we’re going to solve the crisis.
</P><P>
	Right now, the stakes couldn’t be clearer. After all, just look at the horrifying destruction left by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in the past month. Then listen to all the scientists telling us that <mark>climate change</mark> is likely making these storms all the worse. Because, when you do, the question you have to ask isn’t “Should we be pricing <mark>carbon</mark>?”
</P><P><EM>It’s “Why aren’t we?”</EM> </P><P>
	So how does <mark>carbon</mark> pricing work? Who’s using it and how’s it’s been working out? Read on.
</P><H3><STRONG>What Is <mark>Carbon</mark> Pricing?</STRONG></H3><P>
	When entire cities are flooded, farms dry out, or wildfires burn through forests and communities usually thanks in part to <mark>climate change</mark>, there is often a long – and costly – recuperation and rebuilding period. Infrastructure needs repairing or rebuilding. Homes may be damaged or destroyed, and although the federal government usually steps in to help financially, the cost of the recovery is paid for through higher taxes, government borrowing, and insurance rates. Not to mention the medical bills that fall on families affected.
</P><P>
	But even as regular people spend years rebuilding their lives after <mark>climate</mark> events, the companies responsible for the majority of the <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> driving them – think Big Oil – aren’t the ones picking up the bill. Even though they’re also sitting at the top of the list of the world’s most profitable firms. </P><H3><STRONG>Which leads us to</STRONG><STRONG><mark>carbon</mark> pricing.</STRONG></H3><P>
	We know that the public costs of burning fossil fuels are enormous, but the market prices of <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive products and services don’t reflect that reality. Government subsidies for the fossil fuel industry and lack of accountability for <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> allow market prices for these products to stay artificially low, effectively telling polluters that they are free to dump unlimited <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> into the atmosphere without any consequences.

	There are two main types of <mark>carbon</mark> pricing: emissions trading systems (often referred to as ETSs) and <mark>carbon</mark> taxing. For an in-depth and practical analysis of the various pricing mechanisms, their design considerations, and the advantages and disadvantages associated with each, <STRONG><A href=""https://www.<mark>climate</mark>realityproject.org/content/download-<mark>climate</mark>-reality-<mark>carbon</mark>-pricing-handbook"" target=""_blank"">download the <EM><mark>Climate</mark> Reality <mark>Carbon</mark> Pricing Handbook.</EM></A></STRONG></P><P>
	Policies that put a price on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions aim to re-adjust the market to better reflect the true cost of <mark>carbon</mark> and shift that cost to the polluter. The good news is that policies, like <mark>carbon</mark> taxes or “cap-and-trade” programs, <STRONG>have already been adopted in a number of countries around the globe.</STRONG></P><H3><STRONG>So Who Uses It?</STRONG></H3><P>
	<mark>Carbon</mark> pricing policies have been taking shape on various levels, from individual states in the US to multinational regions (like the EU) around the world. Even some corporations are using internal <mark>carbon</mark> pricing strategies on their own.
</P><P><A href=""http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/pricing-<mark>carbon</mark>"" target=""_blank"">More than 40 nations</A> around the world have implemented or are in the process of planning or implementing a <mark>carbon</mark> pricing initiative. Among them, some of the world’s strongest economies, including China, Australia, Brazil, and Canada. The European Union (EU) has adopted <mark>carbon</mark> pricing as a cornerstone of its <mark>climate</mark> efforts through the EU ETS cap-and-trade system. This system includes all 28 EU countries, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

	Many states in the US have also implemented their own <mark>carbon</mark> pricing policies. US states like California have enacted statewide policies, <A href=""https://www.rggi.org/"" target=""_blank"">while nine states in the Northeast have joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</A>, the first mandatory market-based program in the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.
</P><P>
	Some corporations have even developed <mark>carbon</mark> pricing mechanisms to mitigate risks associated with the <mark>climate</mark> crisis, de<mark>carbon</mark>ize and reduce greenhouse gas footprints, prepare for a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy, and increase operational efficiency.  As of 2016, more than 1,200 companies globally report that they have internalized or plan to internalize <mark>carbon</mark> pricing. Among those are 210 US companies, including big names like Microsoft Corporation, Walt Disney Company, and General Motors Company.
</P><H3><STRONG>Does It Work?</STRONG></H3><P>
	So if all these policies have been implemented, how do we know if it’s working?

        Melbourne 3000</A></DIV></DIV><P>The head of car giant General Motors has publicly warned the switch to biofuels such as ethanol and electric cars is now inevitable and with oil prices at record highs, motorists may soon become familiar with the phrase &quot;peak oil&quot;.</P><P>It is the theory that more than half the planet's oil reserves have now been used and demand will inevitably outstrip supply, driving prices ever higher.</P><P>While some experts reject the theory, arguing the planet still holds enormous reserves of oil and gas, peak oil has won a powerful new backer.</P><P>This week, the chief executive of US car giant General Motors, Rick Wagoner, publicly warned the switch to biofuels such as ethanol and electric cars was now inevitable.</P><P>Mr Wagoner concedes the petrol engine's days are numbered, saying oil supply has peaked and the race is on for replacement fuels.</P><P>&quot;We need to develop alternative sources of propulsion based on diverse sources of energy,&quot; he said.</P><P>At the massive Detroit car show, the battle lines are drawn as rivals jostle for the spotlight to show off their green machines - electric petrol hybrids, ethanol friendly engines and more.</P><P>Toyota Australia spokesman David Buttner says it is all clean, healthy competition.</P><P>&quot;If it's a race to find the best way forward, then the best results we're going to get, the faster we're going to really modify the existing technologies, but also the faster we're going to find those new technologies,&quot; he said.</P><H3>Oil prices</H3><P>The cost of crude cracked $US100 a barrel last month and experts predict the price for crude will keep rising as global demand grows faster than supply.</P><P>For Australians, it means higher prices at the pump, possibly $2 a litre for petrol this year.</P><P>It is not just private motorists affected, consumers will pay for the ever increasing costs of moving goods long distance.</P><P>New South Wales Greens MP John Kaye says the day of the gas guzzler is over.</P><P>&quot;It's not the Greens or the environment movement that will end the gas guzzler, it is Mother Nature herself,&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;This is going to have a huge impact on the way we transport ourselves around cities, around the country.&quot;</P><P>Dr Kaye uses pedal power, riding his bike for transport.</P><P>Before he became a NSW Greens MP, he was an electrical engineer with a PhD from California's prestigious Berkeley University.</P><P>He has spent decades researching energy sources and arguing the case for fossil fuel alternatives.</P><P>&quot;To ignore the warning coming from the senior executives of General Motors would be to condemn us to a future where we lose the ability to move,&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;Those economies that thrive and prosper will be those that invested in mass public transport, urgently and immediately.&quot;</P><H3>Major issues</H3><P>Federal Minister for Science and <mark>Innovation</mark> Kim Carr there are major issues that society will have to deal with.</P><P>&quot;The major question arises in regards to the productivity of the nation, the major social questions that arise about the questions that relate to where people live,&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;It is, of course, a major issue for the society to deal with.</P><P>&quot;That's why the Labor Government is moving forward to work with the states to ensure that we have the opportunities available through the development of appropriate infrastructure.&quot;</P><P>More and more US corn and canola fields are producing ethanol. But the drive to make biofuels from crops is driving up the price of grains worldwide.</P><P>Last year, Mexicans struggled to pay for their staple food - the corn bread, tortilla.</P><P>Total Environment Centre spokesman Leigh Martin says adverse effects on the environment must be avoided in the drive for biofuel creation.</P><P>&quot;We need to make sure that diversion of crops into the creation of ethanol doesn't simply drive up fuel prices and that we don't create other global warming problems by clearing vegetation to create crops for generating ethanol,&quot; he said.</P><H3>Biofuel concerns</H3><P>The European Union, which has set a 10 per cent biofuel target, is increasingly concerned about the wholesale clearance of rainforests in Indonesia, Brazil and Latin America to make way for biofuel crops.</P><P>Mr Kaye says In a greenhouse-constrained world where there are difficulties with agriculture, putting pressure on food supplies should be avoided.</P><P>&quot;The last thing we want to do is put transport in competition with food supply, and that's precisely what bioethanol will do,&quot; he said.</P><P>Here in Australia, it is mostly wheat being grown for ethanol and now there is a car to fit - a GM Saab that runs on 85 per cent ethanol.</P><P>The fuel to power it will be on sale in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane.</P><P>A recent CSIRO study predicted that if all currently exported wheat was used to make ethanol, it would replace between 11 per cent and 22 per cent of petrol used.</P><P>But Australia would be forced to import wheat in drought years.</P><P>Senator Carr says there are many issues that need addressing.</P><P>&quot;There are issues that relate to the question of the uses of land supply, there are questions that relate to whether fuel or food is produced from the crops that are available, there are new technologies,&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;However that mean coming on board, which means that we are able to think about different ways in which we can produce biofuels into the future.&quot;</P><H3>Hybrid cars</H3><P>More than a million new cars hit Australia's roads last year, the most popular still, the six-cylinder Holden Commodore.</P><P>But a small and growing proportion, just under 4,000, were imported petrol-electric hybrids.</P><P>They have batteries that charge on the road and use around 50 per cent less fuel.</P><P>Unlike most other drivers, Jacqueline McCann can still laugh when the talk turns to petrol prices.</P><P>&quot;It's very, very cheap to run, I probably fill it up once every three weeks and it's a nice stylish car. It's smooth to drive, it's got everything I need,&quot; she said.</P><P>&quot;[I'm] making a lot of savings on petrol and you can't be unhappy about that.'</P><P>The fully electric car is on the drawing boards of the big car makers.</P><P>US General Motors chief executive Rick Wagoner says they are inevitable.</P><P>&quot;So are electrically-driven vehicles the answer for the mid and long term? For sure,&quot; he said.</P><P>But the future electric plug-in cars will only be as clean as their sources of energy.</P><H3>Cleaner energy</H3><P>Australia relies overwhelmingly on coal, unless it shifts to cleaner sources of electricity, the electric plug-in car would be a step backwards in terms of <mark>CO2</mark> emissions.</P><P>Dr Kaye says a transformation of the transport system in Australia from gasoline based to electricity generated by coal would cause an 18 million tonne a year increase in the nation's greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries spokesman Andrew McKeller says there are important challenges ahead.</P><P>&quot;In terms of the future of coal-fired power stations and clean coal, other sources of electricity, those are important challenges that have to be addressed as part of the overall solution,&quot; he said.</P><P>The Holy Grail is the hydrogen powered car.</P><P>BMW showed off its prototype in Melbourne on Thursday.</P><P>The company says governments must develop the solar and wind energy sources to drive the creation of hydrogen from sea water.</P><P>BMW spokesman Guenther Seemann says the company has shown the way forward.</P><P>&quot;If you want to clap hands you need two hands, right?&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;From our part we showed that a car manufacturer is able to produce an engine with zero emission.</P><P>&quot;The other side is the total infrastructure which is needed to run such cars and this [something] a car company cannot do alone.&quot;</P><H3>Australian cars</H3><P>But Australian car makers are yet to progress in the race to the clean, green car.</P><P>General Motors Holden unveiled a prototype for an electric-petrol car in 2000, but the project stalled.</P><P>Today, it is a Sydney Museum piece.</P><P>The Federal Government is encouraging local manufacturers to go green.</P><P>It will give the industry up to $500 million through its green car <mark>innovation</mark> fund.</P><P>&quot;There are plans under way now to introduce a whole range of new technologies, a whole range of new capabilities,&quot; Mr McKeller said.</P><P>Senator Carr says Australian motor companies will rise to the challenge faced by <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;In my judgment, we will see new technologies emerge in Australia,&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;We want to do all we can to encourage the commercialisation of those technologies, so that Australians do have the options to drive Australian made, green cars.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The longitudinal and multi-dimensional analysis investigates the dynamics of the <mark>climate change</mark> problem in terms of socio-political mobilization by social movements, scientists, wider publics and policymakers. It also analyses how U.S. automakers responded to mounting pressures with socio-political, economic and <mark>innovation</mark> strategies oriented towards low-<mark>carbon</mark> propulsion technologies. We use a mixed methodology with a quantitative analysis of various time-series and an in-depth qualitative case study, which traces interactions between problem-related pressures and industry responses. We conclude that U.S. automakers are slowly reorienting towards low-<mark>carbon</mark> technologies, but due to weakening pressures have not yet fully committed to comprehensive development and marketing. The paper not only applies the DILC-model, but also proposes three elaborations: (a) the continued diversity of technical solutions, and ‘ups and downs’ in future expectations, creates uncertainty which delays strategic reorientation; (b) firms may develop radical <mark>innovation</mark>s for political and social purposes in early phases of the model; (c) issue lifecycles are also shaped by external influences from other problems and contexts.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><UL class=""issue-navigation"" id=""issue-navigation""><LI class=""previous""><BUTTON class=""button-alternative button-alternative-tertiary"" disabled="""" type=""button""><SPAN class=""button-alternative-text""><SPAN><STRONG>Previous </STRONG>article<SPAN class=""extra-detail""> in issue</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></BUTTON></LI></UL></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Additionally, the company participates in the Department of Energy’s Better Buildings, Better Plants initiative to achieve a 25 percent reduction in energy use in 31 of its U.S. plants by 2018. GM identified its paint shops, facilities that use a majority of an assembly plant’s energy load to operate, as one opportunity for finding energy savings. GM enlisted EDF <mark>Climate</mark> Corps fellow Michael Vachiraadisorn to optimize operations for energy conservation, develop best practices for energy, water and <mark>carbon</mark> use, and put together guidelines for paint equipment in one of its facilities.  </P><P><SPAN style=""font-size: 1.385em; font-weight: bold;"">Solutions</SPAN></P><P>Vachiraadisorn familiarized himself with the paint shop’s three modes of operation: production, maintenance and unoccupied. Maintenance mode is designed to be used when the facility has a decrease in occupancy, best suited to be used during non-working hours. However, maintenance mode was not being used due to technical difficulties. Vachiraadisorn realized that by resolving the technical issues and enabling facilities to shut down and enter maintenance mode, GM could save significant amounts of energy. During site visits, Vachiraadisorn also noticed that the space temperature in the paint shop was higher than other facilities in winter, resulting in excess energy use. He recommended that the temperature be regulated to a lower degree. </P><P><SPAN style=""font-size: 1.385em; font-weight: bold;"">Potential Impact</SPAN></P><P>If the paint shop consistently uses maintenance mode during shutdown, GM has the potential to save up to $161,945 a year. By lowering the thermostat setting, the company could save an additional $221,237 annually. In total, Vachiraadisorn’s recommendations could save up to $383,182 annually, putting GM on track to meet its 2020 manufacturing commitments, including reducing energy consumption by 20 percent by 2020.  </P><H4>Related Links</H4></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

				Posted on <A href=""https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/general-motors-and-the-war-against-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" rel=""bookmark"">November 3, 2016</A></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""submission__excerpt entry-summary""><P>The story of how a large company took the driver's seat in the battle against a much larger issue</P></DIV></HEADER><DIV class=""submission__content entry-content""><P>While it is evident that a range of industries (e.g., commodities, tourism) will be directly affected by <mark>climate change</mark>, another set of industries (e.g., oil &amp; gas, automotive) are likely to be impacted by direct consequences of the phenomenon – stricter regulation and changing consumer preferences. General Motors (GM) is a classic example of a company whose industry is being affected by these forces and is making a concerted effort to remain relevant in an environmentally friendly world.</P><P>GM is a $50 bn multinational corporation that produces ~10 mn vehicles in 37 countries under 12 brands [1]. GM’s operations are being affected due to three fundamental shifts due to <mark>climate</mark>-change:</P><P style=""text-align: center""><EM>Exhibit 1 – Impact of <mark>Climate Change</mark> on the Auto Industry [2]</EM></P><P><EM>Changing Customer Preferences</EM>: Due to increases in fuel prices, the type of cars being purchased is expected to change dramatically, that will, in turn, affect manufacturing. Although we are currently seeing lower oil-prices inflating demand, on a longer time scale, manufacturers are seeing reductions in sales of SUVs and fuel-intensive vehicles (Ford F150, Hummers etc.) [3]. Consequently, sales of smaller cars and light vehicles are expected to increase. In addition, a growing trend towards electric and hybrid cars is further proof that a manufacturer’s portfolio in twenty years will look radically different.</P><P><EM>Government Regulation: </EM>Since <mark>CO2</mark> emissions move in tandem with fuel consumption, governments globally are developing stricter regulations on automotive manufacturing [4]. Auto companies, meanwhile, are finding it tougher to adapt to these standards. For example, in 2016 itself, three reputed global auto manufacturers (Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, Suzuki) admitted to wrong-doing while trying to “game” government-set emission regulations [5] [6]. The implication of this dissonance is twofold. One, the bar on quality of manufacturing will become much higher – it is of paramount importance that all car models meet each of the individual countries’ regulations. Two, auto manufacturers must engage more with Government to earn their trust so they can, together, develop standards that are both impactful and realistic.</P><P><EM><mark>Innovation</mark>: </EM><mark>Innovation</mark> will transform the sector over the next few years. In 1997, Toyota’s Prius was the first mass-produced hybrid car, marking the first major shift in energy technology. Since then, Nissan’s Leaf and Tesla’s Model S began the movement towards electric plug-in vehicles. McKinsey believes <mark>climate</mark>-change related regulation will be one of the key drivers towards adoption of electric cars [7]. This step-shift in engine technology increases the necessity for auto manufacturers to invest deeply in R&amp;D to adapt to changing times.</P><P>It is evident that auto companies face a burden in adapting to <mark>climate change</mark>. This burden is substantial – investors have warned the industry it must accelerate its readiness for <mark>climate</mark>-change and take specific actions (put <mark>climate change</mark> specialists on their boards, engage better with policy-makers, and invest more heavily in low-emission cars etc.) [8].</P><P>Given this context, GM has been making fundamental shifts along the following themes to ensure it is prepared to succeed in a world affected by <mark>climate change</mark>:</P><P><EM>Public Commitment</EM>: Mary Barra, CEO of GM, was one of the 7 Auto CEOs that united to publicly vow to tackle <mark>climate change</mark> [9]. This is an unprecedented step that has large implications – if the top manufacturers are committing to the cause, the rest of the industry will follow.</P><P><EM>Energy Efficient Operations</EM>: In the short-term, GM announced that it has saved $73 mn in 2016 through energy-efficient activities and operations [10]. In the long-term, GM declared that it has committed itself to using 100 percent renewable energy by 2050 across its 350 facilities in 39 countries. By 2050, wind, solar and landfill gas will be GM’s main source of energy [11].</P><P><EM>New Technology</EM>: GM is investing heavily in new technology to prepare for a world with electric and hybrid cars. GM’s new Chevy Bolt (2016 release) is expected to be a strong competitor to Tesla’s cars. In 2014, GM invested ~ $500 mn in next-generation electrification [12]. In addition, GM’s bet on ride-sharing through its investment in Lyft also shows its commitment to preparing for the next wave of technology upgradation in the automotive space.</P><P>That said, GM can continue in its push in its efforts in <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation. A few additional ideas are listed below:</P><P><EM>Financing for Electric Cars</EM>: When SUVs sales slowed, GM offered financing options for customers to buy SUVs. A similar initiative for electric cars can be impactful.</P><P><EM>Discontinuing fuel-inefficient lines</EM>: Although gas-guzzlers are profitable and loyal customers exist, GM could lead the transition by discontinuing its fuel-inefficient <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive product lines.</P><P><EM>Supplier Focus – Quality to Environment</EM>: Auto OEMS have tremendous leverage in demanding behavioural changes in component suppliers. If the last few decades involved forcing suppliers to enhance quality, GM could enforce rigorous environmental standards on the massive auto component market.</P><P>[790 words]</P><P>[1] General Motors Annual Report, 2015 https://www.gm.com/content/dam/gm/en_us/english/Group4/InvestorsPDFDocuments/2015AnnualReport.pdf</P><P>[2] “How <mark>Climate Change</mark> could affect corporate valuations”, <EM>McKinsey &amp; Company</EM>, 2008 <A href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-<mark>climate</mark>-change-could-affect-corporate-valuations"">http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-<mark>climate</mark>-change-could-affect-corporate-valuations</A></P><P>[3] “Rising Gas Prices Might Kill the Once-Might SUV”, <EM>Wired</EM>, 2008 <A href=""https://www.wired.com/2008/06/rising-gas-pric/"">https://www.wired.com/2008/06/rising-gas-pric/</A></P><P>[4] “New Automobile Regulations”, <EM>Access Magazine</EM>, 2012 <A href=""http://www.accessmagazine.org/articles/fall-2012/new-automobile-regulations/"">http://www.accessmagazine.org/articles/fall-2012/new-automobile-regulations/</A></P><P>[5] “Emissions Scandal Latest”, <EM>Top Gear</EM>, 2016 <A href=""http://www.topgear.com/car-news/insider/emissions-scandal-latest-mitsubishi-president-steps-down-suzuki-involved"">http://www.topgear.com/car-news/insider/emissions-scandal-latest-mitsubishi-president-steps-down-suzuki-involved</A></P><P>[6] “Volkswagen Reaches Deal in US over Emissions Scandal”, <EM>The New York Times</EM>, 2016  <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/business/international/volkswagen-emissions-settlement.html?_r=0"">http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/business/international/volkswagen-emissions-settlement.html?_r=0</A></P><P>[7] “Disruptive Trends that will transform the Auto industry”, <EM>McKinsey &amp; Company</EM>, 2016 <A href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/disruptive-trends-that-will-transform-the-auto-industry"">http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/disruptive-trends-that-will-transform-the-auto-industry</A></P><P>[8] “Investors warn car companies over <mark>climate change</mark>”, <EM>The Guardian</EM>, 2016 <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/12/investors-warn-car-industry-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/12/investors-warn-car-industry-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change</A></P><P>[9] “Auto Industry CEOs Unite in Rare Vow to Tackle <mark>Climate Change</mark>”, <EM>Forbes</EM>, 2015 <A href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2015/12/14/auto-industry-ceos-unite-in-rare-vow-to-tackle-<mark>climate</mark>-change/#7a2301ec2f15"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2015/12/14/auto-industry-ceos-unite-in-rare-vow-to-tackle-<mark>climate</mark>-change/#7a2301ec2f15</A></P><P>[10] “Energy Efficient Initiatives Save General Motors $73 million during 2016”, <EM>General Motors</EM>, 2016 <A href=""http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/10/energy-efficient-initiatives-save-general-motors-73-million-during-2016/"">http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/10/energy-efficient-initiatives-save-general-motors-73-million-during-2016/</A></P><P>[11] “GM Commits To Be Fossil Fuel Free By 2050”, <EM>General Motors</EM>, 2016 <A href=""http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/09/gm-commits-to-be-fossil-fuel-free-by-2050/"">http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/09/gm-commits-to-be-fossil-fuel-free-by-2050/</A></P><P>[12] “GM Invests $449 for Next Generation Electrification”, <EM>General Motors</EM>, 2014 http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2014/Apr/0408-investment.html</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

At a speech <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>-one.org/video/gm-and-heartland-institute"" target=""_hplink"">earlier this month</A>, GM CEO Dan Akerson said his company is running its business under the assumption that <mark>climate change</mark> is real. </P><P>&quot;We applaud GM's decision and the message it sends -- that it is no longer acceptable for corporations to promote the denial of <mark>climate change</mark> and that support for an organization like Heartland is not in line with GM's values,&quot; said Daniel Souweine, campaign director for Forecast the Facts, a group that urges meteorologists to talk more openly about <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>Internal documents <A href=""http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1-15-2012-2012-Fundraising-Plan.pdf"" target=""_hplink"">leaked in February</A> showed that the General Motors Foundation -- which the automaker runs separately from its business -- donated to the institute $15,000 in 2010 and again in 2011, with another $15,000 expected to be gifted this year.</P><P>Heartland, which identifies itself as a free-market think tank, has questioned the ideas on global warming through its newsletters, web site and associated scientists. Last year, the tagline for its annual conference on the subject was &quot;Global Warming: Was It Ever Really a Crisis?&quot;</P><P>Joseph Bast, president of The Heartland Institute, said GM had been a Heartland supporter for 20 years.  &quot;We regret the loss of their support, particularly since it was prompted by false claims contained in a fake memo circulated by disgraced <mark>climate</mark> scientist Peter Gleick,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;We once again respectfully ask liberal advocacy groups such as Huffington Post, the Center for American Progress, 350.org and Greenpeace to stop attacking scientists who question the theory of man-made global warming and corporations and foundations that are willing to fund open debate on this important public policy issue.&quot;</P><P>The Heartland Institute said the internal documents were stolen by someone posing as a member of the board, who asked for the material to be sent to a new email account. Since then, Peter Gleick, president and co-founder of <mark>climate</mark> research group the Pacific Institute, has confessed to the stunt and noted that <A href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-h-gleick/-the-origin-of-the-heartl_b_1289669.html"" target=""_hplink"">he regrets his actions</A>.</P><P>The bulk of Heartland's funding comes from one anonymous donor, who has given the group $11 million since 2007.</P><P>Nonprofit groups are not legally obligated to reveal their donors. Previously Heartland was transparent about its funding, even posting a list of contributors on its website, but removed it in  2004.</P><P>&quot;Critics who couldn't or wouldn't engage in fair debate over our ideas found the donor list a convenient place to find the names of unpopular companies or foundations, which they used in ad hominem attacks against us,&quot; institute representatives wrote after taking down the list. &quot;After much deliberation and with some regret, we now keep confidential the identities of all our donors.&quot;</P><P>GM was not the only automaker to fund the Heartland Institute: Ford and Chrysler also contributed to it in the past. Ford and Chrysler told The Huffington Post that they had stopped funding the organization over the past decade, but neither automaker had records detailing reasons for pulling that support. </P><P>Greenpeace has pressured companies to stop funding Heartland, said Kert Davies, Greenpeace's research director. &quot;Their brand of intervention on the <mark>climate</mark> discussion, bending the information, is noxious,&quot; he said. &quot;GM doesn't want to be associated with this kind of nonsense on <mark>climate change</mark>, which is great.&quot;</P><P>Jamie Henn of 350.org said Heartland has been spreading misinformation to confuse people. </P><P>The Center for American Progress did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </P><P><EM>This story has been updated to include comments from the Heartland Institute, Greenpeace and 350.org, as well as   details about the role of the Pacific Institute's Peter Gleick in obtaining institute materials.</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Dasgupta</B> noted that the UNFCCC entails commitments from developed countries to curb emissions and provide financial and technical assistance to developing countries. He called for a new protocol that would involve both quantitative emissions and financial targets for developed countries, and allow flexibility in choosing an appropriate balance between the two.
												Addressing scientific underpinnings that could drive the post-Kyoto process, <B>Rajendra Pachauri</B>, speaking in his personal capacity, emphasized inertia in the <mark>climate</mark> system. He noted that defining a level of &quot;dangerous anthropogenic interference with the <mark>climate</mark> system&quot; involves value judgments. He said a future framework should be equitable, efficient, and based on the UNFCCC's principles.
												Noting current emissions trends, <B>Ogunlade Davidson</B>, University of Cape Town, said few Annex II countries will meet their emissions targets by 2012, and observed that excitement for the Kyoto Protocol is waning. He stated that developing countries are rejecting commitments because developed countries have failed to take the lead.
												Speaking in his personal capacity, <B>Harald Dovland</B> suggested identifying a specific atmospheric concentration level to guide discussions on a post-Kyoto framework. He said the Kyoto Protocol was a small but important step, and recommended retaining its best provisions in future <mark>climate policy</mark> architectures. He cautioned against stifling creativity by prematurely addressing post-Kyoto architecture in the official <mark>climate change</mark> negotiations.
												Speaking in his personal capacity, Ambassador <B>Raúl Estrada-Oyuela</B> said the intergovernmental <mark>climate change</mark> process lacks strong leadership. He emphasized that quantified emission reduction targets are unsuitable for developing countries because they entail &quot;grandfathering&quot; allocation and limit growth. He underscored the merits of per capita and sectoral approaches, and opposed emissions allocations based on GDP.<B>José Romero</B>, Swiss Agency for the Environment, Forests and Landscape, said the UNFCCC and its long-term objective provides a suitable framework for future steps. He called for strengthened cooperation between Parties, particularly on technology transfer.<B>Cédric Philibert</B>, International Energy Agency (IEA), recommended retaining emissions trading in a future <mark>climate change</mark> regime because it mobilizes private funding and is environmentally and cost effective. He advocated sector-wide unilaterally funded CDM and non-binding targets for developing countries. Regarding options to reduce cost uncertainties, he identified intensity targets and price caps.<B>Michael Grubb</B>, Imperial College, emphasized that the current <mark>climate change</mark> regime is in trouble. He said Kyoto Protocol Parties could move forward with a declaration even without the Russian Federation, suggesting that this would influence the country to ratify. Grubb suggested forming &quot;coalitions of the willing,&quot; comprised of those dedicated to achieving progress.<B>Asbjørn Torvanger</B>, CICERO, outlined options for post-Kyoto architecture and recommended a &quot;global menu approach,&quot; where Parties would agree on a menu of options and set negotiated targets, allowing countries to choose from the menu according to their national circumstances. He stressed the need to regularly assess progress and strengthen commitments.</FONT></P></DIV></TD></TR><TR height=""50""><TD bgcolor=""#ccccff"" content="""" csheight=""50"" width=""260"" height=""50"" valign=""top"" xpos=""10""><DIV align=""left""><FONT size=""-1"" face=""Verdana, Arial""><B>Michael Grubb</B>, Imperial College, identifies distrust between negotiators as a barrier to effective negotiations.</FONT></DIV></TD></TR><TR height=""65""><TD bgcolor=""#ccccff"" content="""" csheight=""65"" width=""260"" height=""65"" valign=""top"" xpos=""10""><DIV align=""left""><FONT size=""-1"" face=""Verdana, Arial""><B>José Romero</B>, Swiss Agency for the Environment, Forests and Landscape, suggests defining and agreeing on medium to long-term objectives.</FONT></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE width=""785"" border=""1"" cellspacing=""2"" cellpadding=""0"" bgcolor=""white"" height=""6%""><TBODY><TR><TD bgcolor=""#ccccff"" width=""50%""><DIV align=""left""><FONT size=""-1"" face=""Verdana, Arial""><B>More information:</B></FONT></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Exxon and the others were listed as founding members of the plan, alongside the green groups Conservation International and the Nature Conservancy.</P><P>“<mark>Climate change</mark> is already impacting our communities, our economy and our environment and those impacts will continue to grow and become worse if we don’t act now,” said Mark Tercek, chief executive of the Nature Conservancy. “We can’t afford to wait to have these conversations.”</P><P>However, other green groups dismissed the plan as a stunt designed to insulate fossil fuel companies that have sought to undermine or dismiss the science of global warming.</P><P>“ExxonMobil will try to dress this up as <mark>climate</mark> activism, but its key agenda is protecting executives from legal accountability for <mark>climate</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> and fraud,” said Naomi Ages, senior <mark>climate</mark> campaigner at Greenpeace USA. “A nicely worded public relations exercise is no cure for decades of deception.”</P><P>Darren Woods, chief executive of Exxon, said his had been “encouraged by the proposal put forth by the <mark>Climate</mark> Leadership Council as it aligns closely with our longstanding principles”, and would work to develop the policy.</P><P>The plan was crafted by a group of conservative elder statesmen that includes former Republican secretaries of state James Baker and George Shultz and Hank Paulson, a former secretary of the treasury. Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, and the physicist Stephen Hawking are also members of the group.</P><P>Under the proposal, a $40 <mark>carbon</mark> tax, rising over time, would be levied on emissions in order to encourage a shift towards renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. All of the proceeds from the tax would be returned to the American public via “<mark>carbon</mark> dividends” – the group estimates a family of four would receive a payment of $2,000 in the first year.</P><P> As further tradeoff for the new tax, the plan would dismantle all major <mark>climate</mark> regulations, including the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority over <mark>CO2</mark> emissions and an “outright repeal” of the clean power plan.</P><P>Exxon, <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/bp"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">BP</A> and Shell recently voiced support for the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement before Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the US from the pact. All three companies have acknowledged that <mark>climate change</mark> is real and poses an economic and societal threat.</P><P>However, this is the first time they have all publicly backed a price on <mark>carbon</mark>. Exxon has come closest to doing so in the past, with Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive who is now secretary of state, <A href=""http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/company/news-and-updates/speeches/strengthening-global-energy-security"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">remarking in 2009</A> that a “<mark>carbon</mark> tax strikes me as a more direct, a more transparent and a more effective approach” than other systems.</P><P><A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>pricingleadership.org/who/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">About 40 countries</A>, including most of Europe, China and South Africa, have a price on <mark>carbon</mark> or a plan to do so. In the US, California has an emissions trading scheme, which is linked to a similar initiative in the Canadian province of Quebec.</P><P>Barack Obama failed to implement a national market-based response to <mark>climate change</mark> early in his presidency and the chances of the US doing so are now even slimmer under a Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress that is reflexively suspicious of any new tax.</P><P>However, backers of the <mark>Climate</mark> Leadership Council hope that strengthening public support for <mark>carbon</mark> taxes, along with growing concern over sea level rise, droughts and heatwaves, will start to erode the decade-long impasse in US <mark>climate policy</mark>.</P><DIV class=""submeta""><SPAN class=""submeta__label"">Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

GM is also joining <A href=""http://re100.org/http:/there100.org/"">RE100</A>, a global collaborative initiative of businesses committed to 100 percent renewable electricity, working to increase demand for clean power.</P><P>In 2015, GM required 9 terawatt hours of electricity to build its vehicles and power its offices, technical centers and warehouses around the world. To meet its <A href=""http://there100.org/"">new</A> renewable energy goal, GM will continue to improve the energy efficiency of its operations while transitioning to clean sources for its power needs.</P><P>Today GM saves $5 million annually from using renewable energy, a number it anticipates will increase as more projects come online and the supply of renewable energy increases. In addition, the company anticipates costs to install and produce renewable energy will continue to decrease, resulting in more bottom-line returns.</P><P>The new renewable energy commitment builds on GM’s previous goal to promote the use of 125 megawatts of renewable energy by 2020. The company expects to exceed this when two new wind projects come online later this year to help power four manufacturing operations.</P><P>“This bold and ambitious commitment from General Motors will undoubtedly catch the attention of the global automotive industry,” said Amy Davidsen, North America executive director at The <mark>Climate</mark> Group. “GM has already saved millions of dollars by using renewable energy, and like any smart business that recognizes an investment opportunity, they want to seize it fully. We hope that through this leadership, other heavy manufacturing companies will be inspired to make the switch too.”</P><P><B><I>Scaling the commitment</I></B></P><P>GM is in the process of adding 30 megawatts of solar arrays at two facilities in China. Its Jinqiao Cadillac assembly plant in Shanghai will feature 10 megawatts of rooftop solar and 20 megawatts of solar carports, which will cover 8,100 parking spaces at the company’s vehicle distribution center parking lot in Wuhan.</P><P>GM has pioneered the use of renewable energy for more than 20 years, saving <A href=""http://www.generalmotors.green/product/public/us/en/GMGreen/energy_efficiency.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/gm_green/2016/0318_gm_saved_80_renewable.html"">$80 million</A> to date. The company has 22 facilities with solar arrays, three sites using landfill gas and four that will soon benefit from wind.

And they’re both making headway on meeting them: L’Oréal has reduced its <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by <A href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/3069080/how-loreal-is-turning-itself-into-a-sustainability-leader"">73% from 2005</A>, and GM has lowered its waste output by <A href=""http://www.gm.com/mol/m-2017-jun-0601-sustainability.html"">27% since 2010</A>.</P><FIGURE class=""wp-caption alignnone image-wrapper""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">[Photo: Department of Energy]</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>But there’s always room for improvement, and sometimes it takes a fresh set of eyes to see exactly where these giant companies could be doing better. That’s the whole idea behind the <A href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/40411233/the-department-of-energys-reality-show-makes-efficiency-fun"">Better Buildings Challenge SWAP</A>–a <EM>Trading Spaces</EM>-esque web series hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy in which two companies’ energy teams take turns assessing the other’s buildings, looking for missed efficiency opportunities. Season one pitted Whole Foods against Hilton, season two saw an Army-Navy showdown, season three traveled between the government buildings of Boston and Atlanta, and now, for season four, we have the two very large, but very different, consumer goods companies.</P><P>The SWAP is hosted by Maria Vargas, who directs the DOE’s <A href=""https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/"">Better Building Challenge</A>–an initiative that aims to bring buildings across the public and private sector up to the latest energy-efficiency standards. Both L’Oréal and GM have been members of the Better Buildings Challenge for several years. “It opens up a lifeline for sharing best practices,” Eric Fox, L’Oréal’s North Little Rock plant manager, tells <EM>Fast Company</EM>.</P><P>Over the span of a cold weekend in January, the L’Oréal team, based in the company’s North Little Rock, Arkansas, factory and led by Fox, traveled up to GM’s 4.1-million-square-foot Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant to take a look at the operations. “We saw some things that were pretty obvious to us, but maybe they hadn’t noticed,” Fox says. For one, the numerous robots that carry out much of the work at the GM plant require a lot of compressed air to power. Compressed air is a significant drain on energy, and many of the robots remain powered on even when they’re not moving. Fox suggested to the GM team that they implement a system that would automatically power the robots off when they’re not in use, which would significantly lessen the energy consumption from the operations.</P><FIGURE class=""wp-caption alignnone image-wrapper""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">[Photo: Department of Energy]</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Some of the other improvements the L’Oréal team suggested were quite small and straightforward: Be more diligent about detecting air leaks, and use fewer fluorescent lights to illuminate the hallway where the cars leave the facility–just around half the lights they’re currently using are necessary, Fox’s team found.</P><P>At the L’Oréal factory in North Little Rock, which, at 830,000 square feet, is L’Oréal’s largest cosmetics plant in the world, the GM energy team also found some tweaks the facility could make. Like at the GM facility, L’Oréal uses a lot of compressed air to move machinery and product lines along, and the GM team encouraged them to power down when the machines aren’t working to save energy.</P></DIV><DIV class=""ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_1""><DIV class=""ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap""><DIV class=""ad-wrapper__ad-slug"">advertisement</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV><FIGURE class=""wp-caption alignnone image-wrapper""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">[Photo: Department of Energy]</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>But in addition to pointing out what each facility could do better, the teams also snagged some ideas from each other. Brian Wilger, GM’s energy optimization lead, described to the L’Oréal team how he hosts “energy treasure hunts” at the Detroit-Hamtramck factory, where team members seek out parts of the building that could use an efficiency upgrade. L’Oréal, he says, was keen to bring that idea home. And GM, similarly, was impressed with L’Oréal’s efforts boost employee engagement around the Sharing Beauty With All initiative. At the North Little Rock plant, employees are rewarded and highlighted on a wall for advancing energy-savings initiative and encouraged to bring the practices home, which struck a chord with GM. (And of course, at that particular L’Oréal factory, the sustainability initiative is known as “Sharing Beauty With Y’all.”)</P><P>“There are so many people across the facility who could speak in detail about their role in energy efficiency, what it means to them, and how they take it home with them,” Fox says. “It’s really a part of our organizational culture.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE><FOOTER class=""post__footer""><DIV class=""author author--post""><H4 class=""author__title"">About the author</H4><P class=""author__description"">Eillie Anzilotti is an assistant editor for Fast Company's Ideas section, covering sustainability, social good, and alternative economies.

And after a few lackluster years marketing its electric automobile, GM unceremoniously dumped the money-bleeding EV1. It declined to renew the leases on the roughly 1,100 cars it had put on the road, recalled the vehicles, and—with an inadver­tently theatrical flourish—crushed almost all of them and piled their carcasses in a junkyard. The experiment cost the company about $1 billion and was a public relations disaster. Years later a documentary that dramatically recounted the EV1 saga, <EM>Who Killed the Electric Car?</EM>, helped cement the perception that a feckless GM had committed technological infanticide.</P><P>By the mid-2000s, executives realized what a colossal mistake they had made. After riding out the ’90s with a doubled-down commitment to its traditional profit centers—SUVs and light trucks—GM sustained $8.6 billion in losses in 2005. Toyota, which boasted $9 billion in profits that same year, was on the verge of surpassing GM as the world’s largest carmaker. The Japanese firm was riding to victory on a reputation for economical, fuel-efficient cars, especially the Prius, an egg-shaped hybrid that delivered 50 miles per gallon and sold in the hundreds of thousands.</P><P>All of that pissed off Bob Lutz, GM’s vice chair for product develop­ment at the time. A cigar-chomping veteran of the car industry with a penchant for irascible quotes—he once panned GM’s cars for looking like “angry kitchen appliances”—Lutz was especially attuned to the big narratives that drive public perception of the auto industry (while under the surface, most of the real action is driven by recondite stuff like regulation, industrial and trade policy, labor economics, and logistics). Lutz hated how the Prius had put a saintly halo on Toyota, which sold plenty of SUVs and pickups, while hapless GM was mocked for making the Hummer. He also took notice when Silicon Valley upstart Tesla made a major splash with its public debut, announcing it planned to make a lithium-ion-battery-powered luxury sports car.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""section-1452118729897"" class="" show-ipad  bg-white flex-row justify-c relative big-pad-t-50 med-pad-t-50 mob-pad-t-25 big-pad-b-50 med-pad-b-50 mob-pad-b-25 section builder-section-prev-ad builder-section-text builder-section-next-text builder-text-columns-1""><DIV class=""exchange fsb-content relative""><P>And so Lutz, a guy who would later declare that global warming is a “total crock of shit,” began lobbying GM’s leadership to make the biggest, greenest play possible. He didn’t want GM to just build a me-too hybrid to compete with Toyota. He wanted GM to build a fully electric car that almost anyone could afford to buy and that wasn’t limited by range. He wanted, in effect, to build the Bolt. But the technology wasn’t there.
The car that GM actually built at Lutz’s insistence—the Chevy Volt—went on to become one of the most talked-about American vehicles in decades, for a whole host of reasons, many of them symbolic. But in-house, says Tony Posawatz, the engineer who led the team that developed the Volt, it was very clear that this was going to be a transitional car—a warm-up for GM’s electric long game.</P><P>For the Volt, GM settled on a design that was neither a Prius-style hybrid nor a pure electric car but something in between called an extended-range electric vehicle. The setup would combine a plug-in battery strong enough to serve as the car’s main power train, plus a motor with a small gas engine that would work as a generator, creating electricity to keep the vehicle going when the battery was depleted. But even that hybrid design forced GM engineers, to a remarkable extent, to become cavemen rediscovering fire.</P><P aria-hidden=""true"" role=""presentation"" data-js=""fader"" class=""pullquote marg-b-50 carve fader "">Being inside the Bolt feels a bit like flying economy class on a brand-new, state-of-the-art plane.</P><P>Nearly everything changes when you opt for a fundamentally different power train, so GM’s greatest advantage—more than a century of experience building cars—was all but moot. Car structure was different, since they were building around a battery, not an engine. The brakes, steering, and air conditioner were powered differently. New systems, from electromagnetics for the motors to onboard and off-board charging, each came with its own learning curve. The engineers didn’t have established tests to follow. Just turning on the car required finding the perfect sequence of electrical signals from more than a dozen modules. “Oh my God, it took us forever to get the first Volt to start,” Fletcher says.</P><P>Then there was the battery. Lithium-ion chemistry was a new thing 10 years ago, and the Volt team quickly discovered how much of a pain in the neck it is. “Batteries wear out just sitting there, and they wear out when you cycle them,” says Bill Wallace, GM’s head battery engineer. “And then they wear out if you over-discharge them, or if you overcharge them.” They’re extremely sensitive to temperature. They change shape as they charge and discharge. They can also catch fire.</P><P class=""no-marg"">In short, all these problems were new to a company whose experience lay in what Lutz calls “the oily bits.” So the team set about developing the expertise it lacked. GM established a curriculum with the University of Michigan to train battery engineers. It filled a vacant building in Brownstown, Michigan, with the equipment to make battery packs. The engineers created test procedures and wrote them down as they went. They modeled different use cases for the Volt, from a woman in northern Minnesota who plugs in every night to a guy in Miami who drives 100 miles a day. They built the battery lab and brought in the blue environmental chambers, then used them to see how the battery would stand up to each situation. “We invented the idea of what the lab should be,” Fletcher says.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""section-1452118924095"" class="" show-ipad  bg-white flex-row justify-c relative big-pad-t-50 med-pad-t-50 mob-pad-t-25 big-pad-b-50 med-pad-b-50 mob-pad-b-25 section builder-section-prev-text builder-section-text builder-section-next-image builder-text-columns-1""><DIV class=""exchange fsb-content relative""><P>The Volt project was still in its infancy when the US economy tanked in 2008, sending GM into shock. The company began losing $1 billion a month and started cleaving off limbs in desperation, eliminating or selling its Pontiac, Saturn, Saab, and Hummer brands. The Volt project could easily have fallen under the ax as well—but instead it took on an outsize significance. President Obama seized on the car as one reason GM was worth a $40 billion bailout, holding it up as a sign that the bankrupt automaker could adapt. The Volt finally went on sale in December 2010, to accolades (“A bunch of Midwestern engineers in bad haircuts and cheap wristwatches just out-engineered every other car company on the planet.” —<EM><A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304510704575562363168727230"">The Wall Street Journal</A></EM>) and jeers (“roller skates with a plug” —<A href=""http://mediamatters.org/blog/2011/08/23/video-neil-cavutos-bizarre-hatred-for-the-chevy/182259"">Fox News</A>).</P><P>As for actual drivers, they were pretty into the Volt. The car posted stellar customer satisfaction ratings, and nearly 70 percent of its drivers were new to Chevy. The trouble was that there simply weren’t many buyers. In 2011, GM’s CEO at the time, Dan Akerson, told reporters he wanted to produce 60,000 Volts the next year. To date, Chevy has sold about 80,000—total. The Volt was a powerful symbol, but it wasn’t that significant a vehicle. Buyers soon had more innovative cars to choose from. The all-electric Nissan Leaf hit the market at around the same time as the Volt, for a similar price. In 2012, Tesla introduced its first-generation Model S, with upwards of 200 miles per charge.</P><P>But the real significance of the Volt was that it gave GM a brand-new manufacturing and engineering platform for electric vehicles, where it had had none before. “Once you make the leap, and you have a big battery, and you have electric motors,” Posawatz says, “you’ve done all the hard stuff.” And then you might just see an opportunity to gun for the finish line.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""section-1452118678654"" class=""big-pad-t-50 med-pad-t-50 mob-pad-t-25  show-ipad   bg-white  row relative builder-section-image builder-section-prev-text builder-section-image builder-section-next-text parallax bg-black "" data-js=""parallaxRow""><DIV class=""hide""><SPAN>SCROLL DOWN</SPAN></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="" show-ipad   bg-white  flex-row justify-c relative mob-pad-b-25 med-pad-b-50 big-pad-b-50""><P class=""fsb-content marg-t-med""><SPAN class=""credit block bg-white"">

The company had just instituted its largest recall ever, after reports that faulty ignition switches on millions of cars from the 2000s had been responsible for numerous deaths and injuries. Boxer, as part of a congressional investigative committee, was castigating GM’s new CEO, Mary Barra, who had been in the job a mere three weeks. “Woman to woman, I am very disappointed,” Boxer said. “The culture that you are representing here today is a culture of the status quo.”</P><P>Barra sat there, practicing the studiously neutral, calmly repentant facial nonexpression of someone getting grilled by Congress. The main theme of Barra’s testimony was that the old GM—with a docile, nodding bureaucratic culture that swept problems under the rug—had died with the company’s 2009 bankruptcy, bailout, and restructuring and that the new GM was different. But the “culture of the status quo” charge wasn’t so easy for Barra, of all people, to deflect: She’s not only a GM lifer, she’s a <EM>second-generation</EM> lifer. Her dad was a die-maker for Pontiac, and she started with the company when she was 18. (She’s 54 now.)</P><P>On the other hand, Barra had a strong hand in a lot of the most transformative stuff going on at GM. Chief case in point: Not long before she became CEO, Barra had been tapped to run development of new products, the position once held by Lutz. So by the time she was hauled before Congress in 2014 to answer for the company’s past sins, she had been overseeing the efforts of GM’s electrification gang for three years.</P><P>When I walk into Barra’s office one recent fall day, she’s standing in front of her desk wearing black pants, a black turtleneck, and an Apple Watch. (Offsetting the Steve Jobs vibe just a bit is a calendar on the wall that shows a fluffy white cat in the backseat of an Opel Corsa.) As Barra tells it, the process to develop the Bolt really took off when GM’s team was regrouping after a major setback. In 2012, GM invested in a California startup called Envia, which had developed a new battery that posted incredible performance numbers. Envia promised to deliver a 200-mile battery by fall 2013. But its technology turned out to be a flop.</P><P aria-hidden=""true"" role=""presentation"" data-js=""fader"" class=""pullquote marg-b-50 carve fader "">Not only is GM likely to win the race, it may have the winner’s circle to itself for some time.</P><P>So in spring 2013, GM’s senior leaders and the most important figures on its electrification team gathered in the virtual reality room of the company’s Design Center to assess the situation. “We started to go, ‘OK, what can we do?’” Barra says. Was there another route to 200 miles? The EV folks hesitated but started pulling together different elements—improvements in battery life, cost savings in motors—that, combined, might represent a way forward. “We can push our way toward 200,” Fletcher recalls thinking.</P><P>The meeting turned into a full-on brainstorming session, one that ended, Barra says, with what looked like a viable path to the Bolt: “And we all went, ‘Let’s do that.’”</P><P>And so the design team set to work devising a car that would appeal to consumers well beyond the ecowarrior, early-adopter demographic. Some flashy ideas were thrown out early on: A <mark>carbon</mark> fiber body? Lightweight but too expensive at this price point. Suicide doors? Eye-catching, but they added mass without functional benefits. Capped wheels? Good for aerodynamics, but they signaled something science project–y. “It’s got to look like a serious car,” design lead Stuart Norris says. The team delivered as spacious an interior as possible, with upright glass to make the relatively small car feel more substantial and a raised driving position for a commanding view of the road.</P><P>Meanwhile, the technical folks set about making Norris’ design go 200 miles on a charge. At their most basic, batteries are made of powders, the morphology of which—grain size, distribution, how they’re bound together—is key to the power and energy of each cell. LG, General Motors’ battery provider, had cooked up a noticeably improved cell that retained energy capacity particularly well when it got hot, as lithium-ion batteries tend to. That meant Chevy could use a smaller cooling system and stick more cells in the battery pack for more range. LG also improved the battery’s conductivity, so the ions flowed faster, translating to quicker acceleration (the Bolt can go from 0 to 60 in seven seconds).</P><P>As soon as the battery was ready, engineers at GM’s Michigan proving ground hacked together a bastard car using the front half of a Chevy Sonic and the rear of a Buick Encore. They called it the Soncore and fitted it with the Bolt battery pack and motor, using the Franken-vehicle to make sure the propulsion system worked. That way, once the real Bolt body was in development, the teams responsible for the car’s chassis controls, vehicle dynamics, and suspension tuning could get right to work.</P><P>As 2014 bled into 2015, Chevy engineers built about 100 Bolt prototypes, shipping them around the US for real-world testing to verify the findings of the battery lab. The cars went to Arizona and Florida. The team drove them up the California coast and negotiated San Francisco traffic. They ran the prototypes over rough roads, looking for ways to reduce noise and vibration (extra-tricky in a car with no engine to mask odd sounds). They chose specially developed Michelin tires to minimize rolling resistance and improve range. Working fast, they made thousands of changes to the car, constantly looking for ways to improve. By the time I arrived for a test-drive, in October, the team still had more than 500 open work orders to complete.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""section-1452214008722"" class=""big-pad-t-50 med-pad-t-50 mob-pad-t-25  show-ipad   bg-white  row relative builder-section-image builder-section-prev-text builder-section-image builder-section-next-text parallax bg-black "" data-js=""parallaxRow""><DIV class=""hide""><SPAN>SCROLL DOWN</SPAN></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="" show-ipad   bg-white  flex-row justify-c relative mob-pad-b-25 med-pad-b-50 big-pad-b-50""><P class=""fsb-content marg-t-med""><SPAN class=""credit block bg-white"">

That’s about as flashy as things get. There are no gull-wing doors or retracting handles like on some Teslas. The Bolt sits on modest 17-inch wheels. It appears to be a nice, of-the-moment-looking hatchback, like a Prius C or a Honda Fit with a shorter hood and taller roof. The main thing that indicates its revolutionary potential is the dashboard, which tells me I have 192 miles of range, a number I’ve only seen in Teslas.</P><P>Josh Tavel, the Bolt’s chief engineer, invites me to take a seat behind the steering wheel and, from the passenger seat, starts showing me around the interior. He begins with the caveat that the vehicle is only about 80 percent done—thus the big red emergency stop button just above the cup holders and the fire extinguisher in the backseat.</P><P>As I put the Bolt into drive and start exploring the GM Technical Center’s 11 miles of roads, Tavel gives me a tour of the interior. It’s decked out with a bunch of digital-age bells and whistles: On the dashboard is a high-definition 10.2-inch touchscreen. There’s a special space shaped to hold an iPhone 6, with a charge port right there, and a console compartment that fits a tablet. The rearview mirror can pipe in a display from cameras on the back of the car. The car also associates personal settings with different keys, so it knows whether you or your spouse is driving and tunes the radio appropriately. The backseat is remarkably roomy for a compact car, especially when it comes to headroom. I’m taller than average, and there are 3 or 4 inches between my head and the roof.</P><P>Overall, being inside the Bolt feels a little like flying in economy class on a brand-new, state-of-the-art plane. You’ve got a screen, an outlet to plug in your phone, enough legroom, and some sleek appointments. It’s not first class, but it doesn’t rub your nose in that fact the way some economy cabins (and some GM cars) do.</P><P>When I meet with Barra after my test-drive, we start by talking about the big-picture stuff: how the car could fundamentally change public attitudes toward electric vehicles. But she quickly moves on to the little things: the roominess, the connectivity, how the trunk opening is shaped so you can slide in that bookshelf you bought at Ikea. “No one’s gonna buy 200 miles if it doesn’t come with a great vehicle,” Barra says.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""section-1452039966493"" class=""flex-row align-m justify-c no-marg big-pad-t-50 med-pad-t-50 big-pad-b-50 med-pad-b-50 relative  show-ipad   bg-white builder-section builder-section-prev-text builder-section-gallery builder-section-next-text builder-gallery-columns-1""><DIV class=""side-gallery flex-row align-start pad-r-med pad-l-med""><DIV class=""side-image col big-col-8 med-col-8 mob-col-18 mob-pad-b-med""><SPAN class=""caption block mob-marg-b-big center"">GM designers discuss fine-tuning the window glass on the Bolt’s lift gate. <SPAN class=""credit"">Courtesy of GM</SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""side-image col big-col-8 med-col-8 mob-col-18 mob-pad-b-med""><SPAN class=""caption block mob-marg-b-big center"">Although car design happens largely on the computer, clay models remain critical for assessing form, lines, and proportion.<SPAN class=""credit"">Courtesy of GM</SPAN></SPAN></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""section-1452039750153"" class="" show-ipad  bg-white flex-row justify-c relative big-pad-t-50 med-pad-t-50 mob-pad-t-25 big-pad-b-50 med-pad-b-50 mob-pad-b-25 section builder-section-prev-gallery builder-section-text builder-section-next-ad builder-text-columns-1""><DIV class=""exchange fsb-content relative""><P><SPAN class=""lede""><SPAN class=""drop-cap-letter hide-med hide-big"">C</SPAN>HEVROLET SAYS it</SPAN> is on track to start delivering the Bolt by year’s end. If that happens, it’s quite possible the company will have the winner’s circle to itself for some time. It now appears that the next Nissan Leaf will have 110 miles of range—a modest improvement over the current model. Volkswagen is at least two years away from its target. (It’s also tied up with a potentially ruinous scandal after cheating on emissions tests for millions of its diesel vehicles.) And Tesla has a track record of running about two years behind its production targets. But all the automakers will need to start building attractive zero-emissions vehicles somehow, and soon. It’s important to understand that the market for electric cars is still driven less by corporate profit-seeking than by government arm-twisting. In the US, federal fuel standards require automakers to achieve a fleet average of roughly 34 miles per gallon in 2016 and 49 mpg by 2025. On top of that, 10 states won’t let automakers operate unless they sell at least some zero-emission vehicles. All the automakers have to figure out how to get there. </P><DIV data-js=""fader"" class=""inset carve fader inset-image render-layer right fader""><P class=""caption marg-b-med""><SPAN class=""credit""><SPAN class=""visually-hidden"">Photo by:</SPAN>
				Joe Pugliese			</SPAN></P></DIV><P>If you’ve noticed certain names missing from the list of contenders for the race to 200 miles—chiefly Toyota—that’s mainly because Japanese and German automakers have focused on hydrogen fuel cell cars, an embryonic, expensive, and zero-<mark>carbon</mark>-emission technology that has its own problems, like a lack of national fueling infrastructure. Other automakers have responded to the rising tide of mandates with vehicles developed solely to meet requirements and avoid fines (shades of the EV1). The resulting cars are less than compelling and a pain for automakers. In May 2014, Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne actually asked people not to buy the all-electric version of the Fiat 500, saying, “Every time I sell one, it costs me $14,000.” But the math of electric vehicles may begin to change with a mass-market EV like the Bolt, whose sales numbers could be in a different league. Barra wouldn’t disclose a sales goal—Chevy got pretty burned after missing its announced target for the Volt. Kelley Blue Book senior analyst Karl Brauer says that anything more than 50,000 units a year would be a huge coup. A number like that would make the Bolt the best-selling pure electric ever, ahead of Tesla and leagues ahead of Nissan’s Leaf and BMW’s new and funky i3.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""section-1452119030825"" class="" show-ipad  bg-white flex-row justify-c relative big-pad-t-50 med-pad-t-50 mob-pad-t-25 big-pad-b-50 med-pad-b-50 mob-pad-b-25 section builder-section-prev-ad builder-section-text builder-section-next-footer builder-text-columns-1""><DIV class=""exchange fsb-content relative""><P>Even if sales revenue from the Bolt doesn’t equal what GM has spent developing the car—which is likely, because battery power is still expensive—the Bolt will bring other benefits to GM. The car’s fuel economy rating will be so good that even just decent sales would significantly boost GM’s average fleet-fuel-economy numbers, ironically allowing the automaker to sell more pickups and SUVs, where the real profit margins are. </P><P>Perhaps most of all, executives are hoping that the Bolt will change the narrative about GM—which is important because a hapless company that churns out beefy trucks and lackluster sedans doesn’t have much place in the future. These days it’s a refrain among GM executives that in the next five to 10 years, the auto industry will change as much as it has in the past 50. As batteries get better and cheaper, the propagation of electric cars will reinforce the need to build out charging infra­structure and develop clean ways to generate electricity. Cars will start speaking to each other and to our infrastructure. They will drive themselves, smudging the line between driver and passenger. Google, Apple, Uber, and other tech companies are invading the transportation marketplace with fresh technology and no ingrained attitudes about how things are done. </P><P>The Bolt is the most concrete evidence yet that the largest car companies in the world are contemplating a very different kind of future too. GM knows the move from gasoline to electricity will be a minor one compared to where customers are headed next: away from driving and away from owning cars. In 2017, GM will give Cadillac sedans the ability to control themselves on the highway. Instead of dismissing Google as a smart-aleck kid grabbing a seat at the adults’ table, GM is talking about partnering with the tech firm on a variety of efforts. Last year GM launched car-sharing programs in Manhattan and Germany and has promised more to come. In January the company announced that it’s investing $500 million in Lyft, and that it plans to work with the ride-sharing company to develop a national network of self-driving cars. GM is thinking about how to use those new business models as it enters emerging markets like India, where lower incomes and already packed metro areas make its standard move—put two cars in every garage—unworkable.</P><DIV data-js=""fader"" class=""align-bottom   border-t-big related-links fader mob-marg-t-big sm-marg-t-med med-marg-t-med big-marg-t-med mob-marg-b-big sm-marg-b-50 med-marg-b-50 big-marg-b-50 sm-marg-r-50 med-marg-r-50 big-marg-r-50 float-l-sm float-l-med float-l-big""><H4 class=""ambroise-hdr pad-b-med pad-t-med"">Related Stories</H4></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

But they all have one thing in common: they are top voluntary buyers of <mark>carbon</mark> offsets and pursue these purchases as part of comprehensive <mark>carbon</mark> management strategies.</P><P>A new Ecosystem Marketplace report called <A href=""https://www.forest-trends.org/publication_details.php?publicationID=4858"" target=""_blank"">The Bottom Line: Taking Stock of the Role of Offsets in Corporate <mark>Carbon</mark> Strategies</A> dispels the myth that companies purchase <mark>carbon</mark> offsets to avoid taking responsibility for their contributions to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Rather, 14% percent of companies publically disclosing <mark>climate change</mark> information to the CDP’s (formerly the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project) annual survey practice “offset-inclusive <mark>carbon</mark> management,” meaning that they are investing in hundreds of unique emissions reduction projects in addition to directly reducing their <mark>climate</mark> impact through energy efficiency, improved product design and other measures. Offset buyers tracked by CDP spent $41 billion in 2013 to make their buildings and processes more energy efficient, install low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy, switch to cleaner transportation, design more <mark>sustainable</mark> products, and engage customers and employees around behavior change.</P><P>“There’s a common misperception that offsetting is a way for companies to ‘buy their way out of the problem,’” says Allie Goldstein, Senior Associate at Ecosystem Marketplace and the author of the report. “But when you dig into the CDP data, it’s clear that offset buyers are actually just using more of the tools at their disposal to reduce emissions, and they’re investing in these activities at a higher rate compared to companies that don’t offset.”</P><P>This new report analyzed data from 1,882 corporate <mark>climate</mark> performance disclosures collected by CDP in 2013 and 2014.</P><P>Offsetting is an indicator of a deeper <mark>climate</mark> commitment, with offset buyers engaged in activities that reduce their internal emissions at a higher rate than companies that do not buy offsets, according to the report. The typical offset buyer slashed almost 17% of their Scope 1 (direct) emissions in 2013 while non-buyers only reduced Scope 1 emissions by less than 5% in the same year. Offset purchases are one way to neutralize Scope 3 (indirect) emissions that occur upstream in a company’s supply chain or downstream in consumer’s use of the company’s products – emissions that are difficult to reduce by other means.</P><P>The majority of companies (214) offset emissions voluntarily, compared to 56 CDP-reporting companies that purchased offsets to comply with regulations. Companies based in regions with regulatory <mark>carbon</mark> pricing programs were more likely to buy <mark>carbon</mark> offsets, even on a voluntary basis, than companies based in locations without a cap-and-trade system or <mark>carbon</mark> tax. The European Union, home of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), hosts the largest number of buyers – both compliance-driven and voluntary – since even companies in unregulated sectors are more familiar with market-based mechanisms for emissions reductions.</P><H4>Voluntarily taking the lead</H4><P>CDP disclosers voluntarily purchased 16.5 million tonnes in 2013, according to the report, representing about a third of primary market demand as tracked by Ecosystem Marketplace’s State of the Voluntary <mark>Carbon</mark> Markets 2014 report.</P><P>US-based automaker General Motors topped the list of voluntary buyers of <mark>carbon</mark> offsets, purchasing 4.6 million tonnes of offsets over the 2012-2013 timeframe. Its Chevrolet division has been a leading buyer of <mark>carbon</mark> offsets as part of its commitment to <A href=""http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/pages/dynamic/article.page.php?page_id=10357&amp;section=news_articles&amp;eod=1"" target=""_blank"">reduce its emissions by up to eight million tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark></A> – at an estimated cost of $40 million. Chevrolet has also promoted widespread adoption of a new methodology financed by the automaker that aims to <A href=""http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/pages/dynamic/article.page.php?page_id=10196"" target=""_blank"">reward US-based colleges and universities for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects</A>, purchasing the first 500,000 offsets generated by these projects.</P><P>U.K.-based Barclays was second on the list of top voluntary buyers with 2.1 million tonnes purchased, including from an avoided deforestation project in Kenya and renewable energy projects in India and China. In its CDP disclosure, the bank noted its anticipation that tropical cyclones will alter the credit profile of some of its clients.</P><P>California-based utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Brazil-based Natura Cosméticos tied for third place on the list of top voluntary buyers at about 1.4 million tonnes.</P><P>Natura has reduced its relative greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 33.2% over the 2007 to 2013 time period and offset all the emissions it couldn’t avoid through the acquisition of <mark>carbon</mark> offsets from reforestation, energy efficiency, fuel substitution, waste treatment and REDD+ (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), according to a company spokeswoman. The company prioritizes projects that generate other environmental benefits such as improvements in water quality, erosion control and promotion of biodiversity and social benefits in addition to offsetting <mark>carbon</mark>, she said.</P><P>In 2013, <A href=""http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/pages/dynamic/article.page.php?page_id=9932"" target=""_blank"">Natura purchased 120,000 tons of <mark>carbon</mark> offsets from the Paiter-Suruí­</A>, an indigenous people of the Amazon who in June of that year became the first indigenous people to generate offsets by saving endangered rainforest using the Verified <mark>Carbon</mark> Standard’s REDD protocol.</P><P>Delta Air Lines is also on the top 10 list of voluntary buyers of <mark>carbon</mark> offsets and expressed concern in its CDP disclosure that rising temperatures could affect plane take-offs and that sea level rise may encroach on coastal airports.</P><P>The airline’s GHG emissions are primarily related to the amount of fuel it uses, which accounts for more than 98.5% of its total <mark>carbon</mark> footprint and almost one third of its total operating cost. This creates a major incentive to reduce its fuel consumption and costs through internal initiatives such as retiring smaller, inefficient 50-seat jets and replacing them with larger, more efficient aircraft, according to the airline.</P><P>Despite its fuel saving initiatives, Delta experienced a net increase in fuel consumption from 2012 levels due to growth in flying, leading the company to purchase and retire <mark>carbon</mark> offsets against its 2013 and 2014 emissions to achieve its voluntary goal of <mark>carbon</mark> neutral growth compared to 2012. The company’s offsetting strategy evolved from initially partnering with The Nature Conservancy to allow customers to purchase offsets to cover their travel emissions – Delta matches customer and employee offset purchases up to $25,000 every year – to purchasing offsets directly to achieve the airline’s voluntary goals.</P><H4>Following the compliance rules</H4><P>CDP-reporting companies purchased 32 million tonnes for compliance purposes in 2013, according to the report. These disclosures account for a subset of total primary market compliance demand, which the World Bank Group estimated at 174 million tonnes that year.</P><P>ExxonMobil was the top dog on the compliance side, purchasing 10.2 million tonnes of offsets in 2012-2013 – about 3 million more tonnes than Mexico-based cement manufacturer CEMEX – from dozens of projects developed under the Clean Development Mechanism. ExxonMobil is regulated under cap-and-trade programs such as the EU ETS, New Zealand’s ETS, and California cap-and-trade but has publicly advocated for a revenue-neutral <mark>carbon</mark> tax as the “more effective policy option.”</P><P>“Cap-and-trade systems inevitably introduce unnecessary cost and complexity, as well as unpredictable price volatility, as evidenced recently by the EU ETS,” the company wrote in its CDP disclosure. “It is important to remember that a cap-and-trade system requires a new market infrastructure for traders to trade emissions allowances.”</P><P>ExxonMobil mimics the effect of a tax through using a proxy cost of <mark>carbon</mark> embedded in its Outlook for Energy report. “Our proxy cost, which in some areas may approach $80/ton over our Outlook period, is our effort to quantify what we believe government policies could cost to our investment opportunities,” the company disclosed.</P><P>Delta has also been a compliance buyer of offsets, but sees the longer-term risk to the airline industry of neutralizing growing international emissions after 2020 through the International Commercial Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) <A href=""https://www.iata.org/policy/environment/Documents/atag-paper-on-cng2020-july2013.pdf"" target=""_blank"">development of a market-based program</A>. As part of the International Air Transport Association, the trade association of the world’s airlines, Delta said it is currently engaged with ICAO in the development of a <mark>carbon</mark> offset approach to address the risk.</P><P>“With our current offset program, we are gaining experience in the <mark>carbon</mark> market,” a company spokeswoman says.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The greenhouse gas is released through a variety of human activities, including tillage, deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels.

Industries that rely on burning fossil fuels — including the electricity, automobile and cement-making sectors — measure and <A href=""http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/questions/question/2517/"">report their emissions</A> by adding up how much fuel they burn in a year and using estimates for how much <mark>carbon</mark> is locked up in each type of fuel.</P><P>A unit of <mark>carbon</mark> is <A href=""http://www.terrapass.com/<mark>carbon</mark>-footprint-calculator/"">usually designated</A> as 1 metric ton. Governments assign a price per 1 ton of <mark>carbon</mark>, and then issue permits up to the yearly agreed-upon limit. Companies or governments then buy, sell, and trade these permits with each other based on the amount of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide each needs to emit throughout the year.</P><P>In this way, <mark>carbon</mark> markets operate much like any other type of market but, instead of growing, as the price of <mark>carbon</mark> increases, governments will issue fewer permits each year — reducing total <mark>carbon</mark> emissions over time.</P><P>Nearly 40 countries and more than 20 cities, states, and provinces <A href=""http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/05/26/<mark>carbon</mark>-pricing-initiatives-nearly-50-billion"">currently use</A> some kind of <mark>carbon</mark> pricing system. In the United States, <mark>carbon</mark> markets operate in the Northeast and California (which has linked its market with Quebec’s for a joint effort).</P><P>Globally, one-quarter of emissions are <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>trust.org/a-2016-<mark>carbon</mark>-market-forecast/"">now priced</A> under a <mark>carbon</mark> market scheme, and this proportion is expected to rise in the coming years.</P><P>The concept especially <A href=""http://www.<mark>carbon</mark>pricingleadership.org/news/2016/1/29/<mark>carbon</mark>-pricing-leadership-coalition-official-launch-report"">gained momentum</A> late last year in Paris following the United Nations’ Conference of the Parties meeting, or COP 21, where governments from around the globe pledged to take action against <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The Paris Agreement acknowledges that the private sector should play an important role in reducing greenhouse gases. Beyond buying permits, corporations can pay for projects that reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, such as planting trees or installing solar panels, and receive “<mark>carbon</mark> credits” to sell on the marketplace.</P><P>To this end, big companies are leading some of the largest reduction efforts.</P><P><STRONG>GM’s Leadership in Voluntary <mark>Carbon</mark> Markets</STRONG></P><P>One corporate success story is General Motors’ Chevrolet <mark>Carbon</mark>-Reduction Initiative. Between late 2010 and 2015, the auto company supported projects through a $40 million investment that prevented 8 million metric tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from entering the earth’s atmosphere — roughly the same emissions from the annual energy used by every home in Detroit, <A href=""http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2015/nov/1118-<mark>carbon</mark>.html"">according to the automaker’s pressroom</A>.</P><DIV id=""attachment_8094"" style=""width: 231px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">David Tulauskas is Director of Sustainability at General Motors</P></DIV><P>I spoke to <A href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidtulauskas"">David Tulauskas</A>, Director of Sustainability at General Motors, about Chevy’s initiative. He told me that Chevy’s leadership in the <mark>carbon</mark> market space started with “thinking big, crazy, bold ideas for how to make one of our brands <mark>carbon</mark>-neutral.”</P><P>“At the time, the initiative was the largest voluntary <mark>carbon</mark> program. This was not a response to any policy compliance but recognition that we could help change consumer habits,” Tulauskas said.</P><P>At the same time that Chevy launched its <mark>carbon</mark>-reduction initiative, the company was introducing its gas-electric hybrid, the Volt — its first electric vehicle targeted at a mainstream audience. “We needed to change the conversation,” Tulauskas said. “Chevy was wanting to change the perception of the brand and wanted to do it in a big way that was unique.”</P><P>Tulauskas said that the emissions reduction target of 8 million metric tons also roughly equals (albeit coincidentally) the average annual emissions from Chevrolet’s entire fleet, but that “Chevy was not trying to offset its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint [with this initiative].” The introduction of the Volt — and the upcoming all-electric Bolt — will help to lower fleet emissions.</P><P>Instead, the company aimed to lead the way for corporate voluntary reductions and engage with communities directly. “We wanted to do something that had a measurable impact in the communities in which we operate that helps address <mark>climate change</mark>.” To this end, Chevy chose to retire all the accrued <mark>carbon</mark> credits to benefit the <mark>climate</mark>, instead of using them to offset emissions of its vehicles or operations.</P><P>As part of a voluntary initiative, the brand supported 38 <mark>carbon</mark>-reducing projects in 29 states. Projects included building wind farms, supporting forest and grassland preservation, and a program to increase energy efficiency on college campuses. “We worked with 11 universities across America to support their greenhouse gas reduction initiatives,” Tulauskas said.</P><P>“More than 700 universities have made commitments to offset emissions, and so many were going out and buying credits. What we did was allow them to reduce emissions while getting paid for their <mark>carbon</mark>-reduction efforts.”</P><P>For advice, Chevy pulled together a diverse group of people from a variety of backgrounds, including <A href=""http://www.bard.edu/cep/about/faculty/"">Bard CEP’s Director, Eban Goodstein</A>. On GM’s <A href=""http://www.generalmotors.green/product/public/us/en/GMGreen/energy_efficiency.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/gm_green/2015/1120_sue-hall-guest-campuses.html"">Green pages</A>, Director Goodstein highlights how <EM><mark>innovation</mark></EM> plays an important role in the initiative’s corporate leadership:</P><P>“If we’re serious about keeping global warming to a 2-degree rise, we need Chevrolet’s kind of leadership that has broad applicability far beyond their own operations or supply chain or their firt dozen campus projects. Chevrolet created an entirely new avenue — a new source of capital from the U.S. voluntary <mark>carbon</mark> markets — to support serious <mark>carbon</mark> reductions at all qualifying universities across the entire U.S.”</P><DIV id=""attachment_8093"" style=""width: 570px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Chevrolet’s $40 million <mark>Carbon</mark>-Reduction Initiative supported the reduction of 8 million metric tons of <mark>carbon</mark> and was the largest voluntary initiative of its time.</P></DIV><P> </P><P><STRONG>Leadership Means Learning from Your Mistakes</STRONG></P><P><A href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/pat-nye-7398278"">Patrick Nye</A> is Senior Consultant for <mark>carbon</mark> and renewable energy at Portland, Oregon-based <A href=""http://www.b-e-f.org/"">Bonneville Environmental Foundation</A> (BEF) and has years experience with <mark>carbon</mark> markets, including helping to create the voluntary market in 2000 by closing the first retail Renewable Energy Certificate trade deal with the Environmental Protection Agency. Nye also advised Chevy on its <mark>carbon</mark>-reduction program and, when I spoke with him, described BEF’s role as playing a “broker of <mark>carbon</mark> credits” for the project.</P><P>“Chevy wanted an impartial third party to find the best projects. BEF offered added layers where they would evaluate the projects, provide due diligence, etc.”</P><DIV id=""attachment_8092"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">In 2000, Bonneville Environmental Foundation was instrumental in creating the voluntary <mark>carbon</mark> market along with the EPA.</P></DIV><P>Nye said that leadership in <mark>carbon</mark> markets makes room for admitting failure. When any large corporation takes on a reduction target larger than those ever attempted before, there will be a lot of learning through trial and error. Corporate leadership is about accepting the errors along with the successes — and learning from both.</P><P>“We were supporting things that were new and cutting edge, so some projects fell through,” Nye said. “Chevy was interested in supporting energy-efficiency <mark>carbon</mark>-offset production on college campuses. This was a first. [Chevy’s] is now a published methodology that any campus can use.”</P><P><STRONG>Correctly Pricing <mark>Carbon</mark> is Key to Effective Markets</STRONG></P><P>Nye also pointed out that a key to ensuring that <mark>carbon</mark> markets are effective in actually lowering emissions is for a ton of <mark>carbon</mark> to be correctly priced. “The <mark>carbon</mark> market is very low right now. There are not as many voluntary buyers right now and the price of <mark>carbon</mark> has bottomed out,” Nye said. “Also the competition is high.”</P><P>GM’s Tulauskas is more positive about the prospects for <mark>carbon</mark> markets, despite the low pricing, saying “[markets] are very effective at reducing <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, because every ton that is reduced is verified.”</P><P>Tulauskas points to a specific, positive example of a <mark>carbon</mark> market that has, more or less, figured out its pricing scheme. “California is a good example of a stable <mark>carbon</mark> price, between 10 and 12 dollars [per metric ton],” he said. “With a long-term plan for costs to rise, it is important to set the right market signal: If the price is too low, it supports the status quo. If the price is too high, it will be disruptive.”</P><P>Nye, too, sees California as a <mark>carbon</mark> pricing leader: “Compliance is going to drive the <mark>carbon</mark> market. For the U.S., California is pretty restrictive and will be the state driving the market. […] In time, we will hope to see more compliance symbols and that will help.”</P><P>Experts agree that pricing <mark>carbon</mark> alone will not halt <mark>climate change</mark>, but the idea is becoming an integral piece of the solution as it gains support. <A href=""http://www.<mark>carbon</mark>pricingleadership.org/"">The <mark>Carbon</mark> Pricing Leadership Coalition</A>, launched on the first day of COP 21, brings governments together with more than 90 global businesses and nonprofits to expand <mark>carbon</mark> pricing worldwide.</P><P>“The size of <mark>carbon</mark> markets will vary depending on how broadly the policies are applied across a country,” Tulauskas said, “but there will always be a role to play for voluntary <mark>carbon</mark> markets.”</P><DIV class=""sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled""><DIV class=""robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing""><H3 class=""sd-title"">Share this:</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Chevron Corp., et al.</EM>, No. 17CIV03222, 2017 WL 3048970 (Cal. Super. Ct. filed July 17, 2017) (&quot;<EM>San Mateo</EM>&quot;). The plaintiffs in these lawsuits sued a number of major energy companies (36 in total) that were allegedly responsible for roughly 20% of global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions since the 1960s. Like the <EM>Oakland</EM> and <EM>San Francisco</EM> complaints, the <EM>San Mateo</EM> complaints allege that the fossil fuel company defendants funded scientific studies and public relations campaigns to create uncertainty about the existence, causes and risks of <mark>climate change</mark> – despite the defendants' own internal understanding and acknowledgement of <mark>climate change</mark> and the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> from <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from fossil fuels. The <EM>San Mateo </EM>complaints seek damages for the historical and prospective damage that <mark>climate change</mark> allegedly has caused in these coastal California communities.</P><H3>A growing trend</H3><P>These complaints are part of a growing trend by plaintiffs' lawyers and environmental activists to turn to the judiciary in certain states, like California, with a strong political commitment to addressing the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on the environment. In addition to this spate of recent lawsuits filed by various California cities and municipalities, attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts have issued wide-ranging investigatory subpoenas upon ExxonMobil. These subpoenas seek documents related to Exxon's internal understanding of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and <mark>climate change</mark>, and any alleged efforts Exxon took to promote contradictory studies and information with the purpose of misleading the public.</P><P>One common thread to the various <mark>climate change</mark> investigations and litigations over the last few years is that they are being pursued in &quot;blue states&quot; such as California, New York and Massachusetts, at the same time that President Trump and the Republican controlled Congress have taken, or explored taking, various steps to roll-back <mark>climate change</mark> initiatives championed by the Obama Administration. These federal rollbacks include President Trump's stated intention to withdraw US participation from the Paris Agreement, the current EPA decision to review (and possibly scale back) the enforcement of the Clean Air Act as it relates to certain <mark>climate change</mark> issues, and a general lack of enthusiasm by federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, to pursue litigation or more aggressive regulation relating to the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><H3>Will these recent California tort claims succeed or fail?</H3><P>In our view, they will fail and fail early on at the motion to dismiss stage of the litigation. In fact, no US lawsuit asserting nuisance or other tort claims predicated on <mark>climate change</mark> theories of liability and entitlement to remedial relief has proceeded beyond the motion to dismiss phase, and there is little reason to think that <EM>Oakland/San Francisco</EM> and the <EM>San Mateo</EM> complaints will fare any better. The <EM>San Mateo</EM> defendants have removed the complaint to federal court, where they will move to dismiss; the defendants in the <EM>Oakland/San Francisco </EM>litigations will likely do the same. The defendants in these cases will be able to assert a number of compelling defenses, which we generally describe and identify below. In our view, the following defenses, alone or in tandem, likely will prove fatal to these California claims.</P><H4>Lack of standing</H4><P>As a prerequisite to asserting a cause of action in federal court, a plaintiff must show that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury, that this injury is fairly traceable to the defendant's alleged conduct, and that the injury can be redressed by a favorable decision by the court. Several prior attempts seeking to hold fossil fuel companies liable for the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> have foundered on this ground. For example, in <EM>Washington Environmental Council v. Bellon</EM>, 732 F.3d 1131 (9th Cir. 2013) (&quot;<EM>Bellon</EM>&quot;), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring suit to compel a state agency to regulate the emissions linked to five oil refineries. The court held that there was an insufficient causal nexus between the defendants' emissions and any injuries that might occur in Washington state as a result of <mark>climate change</mark>. Similarly, the same court held in <EM>Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil</EM>, 696 F.3d 849 (9th Cir. 2012) (&quot;<EM>Kivalina</EM>&quot;), that the plaintiffs – natives of a coastal town in Alaska that was allegedly facing higher risk of storm damage as a result of <mark>climate change</mark> – lacked standing to bring a nuisance suit arising from Exxon's <mark>carbon</mark> emissions because <mark>climate change</mark> has been going on for at least decades and is caused by <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from a multitude of sources. In other words, because <mark>climate change</mark> is a sprawling phenomenon with multiple potential causes and effects, in order to prove standing a plaintiff needs to allege concrete and particularized injuries that directly flow from a particular defendant or defendants' alleged tortious conduct and emissions. Without such a causal nexus, plaintiffs lack standing to pursue <mark>climate change</mark> claims.</P><P>Courts have also dismissed claims for lack of standing on the grounds that the alleged injuries (which can include prospective or anticipated rises in sea levels and storm intensity as is being alleged in the recent California filings) are not sufficiently concrete and particularized. In <EM>Kivalina</EM>, for example, the court held that the plaintiff's claimed injuries (allegedly caused by rising sea levels) could not support standing because they were not bounded in time and not linked to any specific conduct by the defendant in the litigation.</P><P>Other federal courts have also held that plaintiffs do not have standing to assert claims against fossil fuel companies on the basis of future injuries that may be caused by <mark>climate change</mark>. In <EM>Conservation Law Foundation v. ExxonMobil</EM>, No. 16-11950-MLW (D. Mass.), an enforcement suit under the Clean Water Act and Solid Waste Disposal Act, a trial court in the District of Massachusetts recently held that while the plaintiffs did have standing to assert that the defendants were not in current compliance with their environmental permits, plaintiffs did not have standing to assert injuries that could be caused by rising sea levels and other effects of <mark>climate change</mark> that would occur &quot;far in the future.&quot;</P><H4>Federal preemption based on federal common law and Clean Air Act</H4><P>One of the grounds for removal to federal court asserted by the defendants in the San Mateo case is that the plaintiffs' claims are preempted by federal law. This argument is supported by the Supreme Court's 2011 decision in <EM>American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut</EM>, 564 U.S. 410 (2011) (&quot;<EM>AEP</EM>&quot;), where the court held that federal nuisance claims that seek to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions are displaced by the Federal Clean Air Act. The Ninth Circuit in Kivalina followed AEP to reach the same conclusion. <EM>See</EM> 696 F.3d at 857-58.</P><P>While the Supreme Court has yet to extend this federal displacement ruling to bar on preemption grounds claims brought under state nuisance laws, such as <EM>San Mateo</EM> and <EM>Oakland/San Francisco</EM>, a district opinion relied on AEP to conclude that such state law claims are also preempted by federal law. <EM>See Comer v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc.</EM> 839 F.Supp.2d 849, 865 (S.D. Miss. 2012). This conclusion is in line with the federal, or, more accurately – the global scope of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Indeed, as the <EM>San Mateo</EM> defendants argued in their removal petition, the plaintiffs' attribution theory of causation would necessarily require an over-arching analysis of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions across the United States, as well as all other nations across the world. The preeminence of federal law over such questions of interstate and foreign commerce and policy suggests that federal law preempts federal common law and state law nuisance claims that seek to abate <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and address any injuries caused by <mark>climate change</mark>. This is so that <mark>climate change</mark> policy can be developed by the democratically accountable branches of government in a coordinated way at the federal level, rather than via individual tort claims pursued under various theories of state tort law.</P><P>The <EM>San Mateo</EM> defendants also argue that the complaint implicates a number of federal questions that cannot be resolved under state law, including nationwide <mark>climate change</mark> and <mark>carbon</mark> emission policies and the federal regulatory framework governing <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. The removal petitions also raise numerous constitutional questions, such as whether state law can hold corporations liable for promoting an allegedly deceptive campaign to mislead the public as to <mark>climate change</mark>; whether the state nuisance claims will regulate interstate and foreign commerce; and whether due process permits plaintiffs to use state law to hold the defendants liable for the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, given that it is the combustion of fossil fuels, rather than the extraction and marketing of those fuels, that creates the <mark>carbon</mark> emissions that cause <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><H4>Political question doctrine</H4><P>The defendants in <EM>San Mateo</EM> and <EM>Oakland/San Francisco</EM> also may assert as a related defense the political question doctrine, which requires federal courts to abstain from deciding a case in a way that would impinge on the authority of another branch of government. The political question doctrine is rarely invoked, especially when a plaintiff has adequately shown that it has standing to sue. As such, the doctrine is not often discussed in the context of <mark>climate change</mark> litigation.</P><P>In the few cases in which the doctrine has been asserted as a defense, however, at least one district court has held that claims arising from alleged injuries caused by <mark>climate change</mark> are precluded by the political question doctrine because resolution of the claims would require the court to make an initial policy decision to <mark>climate change</mark>. <EM>See People of the State of Calif. v. General Motors, Corp.</EM>, No. C06–05755 MJJ, 2007 WL 2726871 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 17, 2007). Conversely, the Second Circuit, <EM>Connecticut v. American Electric Power Co.</EM>, 582 F.3d 309 (2d Cir. 2009), and Fifth Circuit, <EM>Comer v. Murphy Oil USA</EM>, 585 F.3d 855 (5th Cir. 2009), have reached the opposite conclusion, with the Fifth Circuit holding that tort claims rarely present political questions because the common law of torts provides sufficient rules for the adjudication of a case without interfering with the prerogatives of the other branches of government.</P><H4>Lack of proximate causation</H4><P>If these recent California complaints were to survive the above arguments for their dismissal at the motion to dismiss stage (an outcome we see as unlikely), it will be extremely difficult for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendants caused, or will cause, the alleged injuries. As in any tort suit, plaintiffs seeking to hold fossil fuel companies liable for the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> must show that the defendants' conduct was a proximate cause of the alleged injuries. The problem these plaintiffs will face in proving causation is similar to the problems faced by the plaintiffs in <EM>Kivalina</EM> and <EM>Bellon</EM>, where courts dismissed claims for lack of standing due to the fact that <mark>climate change</mark> is a process that has been occurring for decades as the result of countless emission sources. Indeed, given the inherently indefinite nature of the causal mechanism between <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from countless sources over a multi-decade period and particular issues alleged by a particular plaintiff that are quite localized in nature (<EM>e.g</EM>., rising sea levels off the coast of Northern California), how can a plaintiff show that the emissions of a group of fossil fuel companies selected as defendants in a particular litigation were the reasonably foreseeable cause of any particular plaintiff's alleged injury?</P><P>The plaintiffs in <EM>San Mateo</EM> appear to have attempted to solve this causation problem by alleging that the named defendants are &quot;directly responsible&quot; for approximately 20% of global emissions between 1965 and 2015, by virtue of their &quot;extraction, promotion, marketing, and sale of fossil fuel products.&quot; However, this theory raises several questions such as the following:</P><UL><LI>Does proving that the defendants were responsible for 20% of the global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions mean that the defendants should be fully liable (or 20% liable) to the plaintiffs for the plaintiff's alleged injuries caused by <mark>climate change</mark>?</LI><LI>Why are the defendants &quot;directly responsible&quot; for these emissions while the end users of their fossil fuels bear no responsibility for <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, including private and commercial drivers of cars and trucks; the automobile and airline industries; coal and natural gas power plants; and various other individuals, companies and governments who use fossil fuels to meet their energy needs?</LI><LI>Exactly what is the tortious conduct of these defendants plaintiffs are alleging that caused plaintiffs' injuries? Was it the extraction and sale of fossil fuels, their promotion, or defendants' alleged denials or failures to disclose the effects of fossil fuel production on <mark>climate change</mark>?</LI><LI>Are the plaintiffs arguing that regulators would have banned or severely curtailed the sale of fossil fuels – the energy foundation of our economy since the industrial revolution – had defendants not allegedly denied the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>?</LI><LI>Are plaintiffs arguing that regulators and the scientific community at large did not also know for decades about the potential links between <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and <mark>climate change</mark>?</LI><LI>Can the plaintiffs prove that the defendants' conduct, including their alleged deception as to the causes and effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, led to higher emissions than otherwise would have been the case?</LI><LI>For example, if the defendants had curtailed, or even halted altogether, their efforts to extract, promote, market and sell fossil fuels, what effect would that cessation have had on global emission levels, if any? Would various other private and government entities that are also providers of fossil fuels (not named as defendants in these cases) have increased their own sales as a result?</LI><LI>With respect to the particular injuries being alleged of rising sea levels in California coastal communities, how will plaintiffs demonstrate that these rising sea levels are due to <mark>climate change</mark> in general, let alone the particular emissions of the defendants named in these lawsuits, as opposed to other geological factors?</LI></UL><P>Plaintiffs will have to satisfactorily answer difficult causation questions such as the above in order to prove tort liability and entitlement to remedial relief if the cases were to proceed past the motion to dismiss stage of the litigation. Moreover, many of these same causal questions, as explained above, will merit consideration as part of the analysis of more threshold legal issues to be decided at the motion to dismiss stage, such as lack of standing and federal preemption.</P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><H3>Conclusion</H3><P>The <EM>San Mateo</EM> and <EM>Oakland/San Francisco</EM> complaints face major stumbling blocks at the motion to dismiss phase, and are likely to suffer similar fates as did the plaintiffs in <EM>Bellon</EM> and <EM>Kivalina</EM>.</P><P>While courts have generally been inhospitable territory for <mark>climate change</mark>-related litigation, these cases will be monitored by all sides to see if they can survive into the discovery or judgment phases. Any success by the plaintiffs would increase the prospects of similar suits by other coastal cities and municipalities in California and in other US states. By contrast, the failure of these California claims to proceed past the motion to dismiss stage of litigation could temper enthusiasm for additional lawsuits in this area, at least if the primary goal of these suits is to obtain remedial relief.</P><P>On the other hand, if a principal goal is to use litigation as an instrument of promoting the political and public policy agenda of those funding or pursuing these lawsuits (<EM>e.g.</EM>, by looking to raise public awareness and galvanize public support for stronger <mark>climate change</mark> regulation), then future <mark>climate change</mark>-related claims may still be brought, even if the prospects of winning these cases in the litigations themselves remain extremely remote.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-views pane-our-people-node pane--borderBottom paneTitle--caption""><DIV class=""widthContain""><H2 class=""pane-title"">Key Contacts</H2><DIV class=""view view-our-people-node view-id-our_people_node view-display-id-block_2 profileListing profileListing--carousel view-dom-id-89f0420b3c67be0fa25fb5a7325873fa""><DIV class=""view-header""><P>If you have any questions, or would like to know how this might affect your business, phone, or email these key contacts.</P></DIV><DIV class=""view-content""><DIV class=""views-row views-row-1 views-row-odd views-row-first""><DIV class=""views-field views-field-rendered-entity""><SPAN class=""field-content""><DIV about=""/our-people/benjamin-rubinstein"" typeof=""sioc:Item foaf:Document"" class=""ds-2col-stacked node node--contact view-mode-contact_display_block  node--contact-display-block node--contact--contact-display-block clearfix""><BUTTON class=""contactCard-buttonWrapper""><DIV class=""group-left""><DIV class=""field field--name-field-contact-title field--type-text field--label-hidden lang-en""><DIV class=""field-items""><DIV class=""field-item even"">

Chicago, Cleveland. We are the last one,&quot; said Guy Williams, CEO of Detroiters Working for Environmental Justice, who introduced six speakers at a presentation of the report at the Northend Christian CDC Campus in Detroit.</P><P>For years Williams has sought business and community support to address the negative impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on Detroit's residents, especially the young, old and poor who are most vulnerable and at risk.</P><P>But it wasn't until 2011, when Williams and Kimberly Hill Knott, the project's director for the Detroit <mark>Climate</mark> Action Collaborative, put together an alliance of scientists that they were able to gather the baseline data and identify the city's environmental and public health issues.</P><P>Scientific collaborators include various departments and agencies within the University of Michigan, Wayne State University and Michigan State University. Business supporters include Ford Motor Co., <mark>General Motors Corp.</mark>, DTE Energy Co., Detroit Salt Co. and Data Driven Detroit.</P><P>&quot;We had so many other distractions in Detroit with the bankruptcy filing and financial problems that slowed us down,&quot; said Williams, who has been working on issues of environmental justice for 22 years. &quot;In the mid-'90s, Mayor Archer was hostile to our movement. He led other mayors nationally to approve a resultion that was a denouncement of environmental justice.&quot;</P><P>In 2017, Mayor Mike Duggan joined 350 other mayors to agree to the principles of the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Accord that call for major reductions in <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and other harmful gases that worsen global warming. Duggan already had created the city's first office of sustainability, focused on improving the economic, social and environmental well-being of city residents and neighborhoods.</P><P>&quot;Detroit has a <mark>climate</mark> action plan,&quot; said Joel Howrani Heeres, Detroit's director of sustainability, adding that the report &quot;lays out an important foundation for the sustainability office&quot; to follow.</P><P>Heeres said goals listed by the Detroit <mark>climate</mark> action report engage residents and businesses to take steps individually and organizationally to improve the environment.</P><P><IFRAME height=""450px"" src=""http://www.crainsdetroit.com/assets/PDF/CD1128591026.PDF"" width=""100%"">This browser does not support PDFs.

Rainfall has steadily increased the past 100 years with the most increases in the fall, he said.</P><P>&quot;It will increase in frequency in Detroit,&quot; Gates said. &quot;We hope to make Detroit a leader in <mark>climate</mark> adaptability and <mark>innovation</mark>.&quot;</P><P>Natalie Sampson, a member of the collaborative and assistant professor of public health at UM-Dearborn, said there is a public health crisis in Detroit with asthma rates up 29 percent.</P><P>&quot;Everyone would benefit from us achieving these recommendations, particularly those most vulnerable. For example, knowing that the mortality rate among senior citizens increases by nearly 18 percent during extreme heat days should motivate us all to act,&quot; Sampson said.</P><P>Dominic DiCicco, a member of the collaborative and Ford's manager of environmental policy, said Ford has been moving for several years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at its manufacturing operations and products.</P><P>&quot;Contributing to a better world has always been a core value at Ford, and our commitment to sustainability is a key part of who we are.

The serial entrepreneur has founded a gaggle of companies meant to save the world: Tesla Motors Inc. (<A href=""/markets/stocks/tsla/"">TSLA</A>), SolarCity Corp. (<A href=""/news/tesla-acquire-solar-city-tsla-scty/"">acquired by Tesla</A>), Neuralink, The Boring Company. And should that mission fail, he's working on a Martian insurance policy in the form of SpaceX.</P><P>But as Musk often reminds us, he's only doing all this because the world needs so much saving. His trademark cocktail of voice-crying-out-in-the-desert pessimism and there's-an-app-for-that optimism has received astonishing uptake: Tesla recently <A href=""/news/why-tesla-should-be-worth-more-gm-tsla-gm/"">surpassed</A> General Motors Co. (<A href=""/markets/stocks/gm/"">GM</A>) to become the U.S.'s most valuable carmaker in terms of market capitalization, despite selling less than 1% as many cars last year (76,230 to GM's 10 million). So hear him out.</P><H2><mark>Climate Change</mark></H2><P>Speaking at the Sorbonne in the run-up to the 2015 signing of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement, Musk called humanity's <mark>carbon</mark>-spewing a &quot;very, very extreme threat&quot; and laid out two potential scenarios. The best-case scenario is &quot;simply delaying that inevitable transition to <mark>sustainable</mark> energy&quot; – inevitable because fossil fuels will eventually run out. (See also, <EM><A href=""/news/should-elon-musk-let-someone-else-run-tesla-tsla-gm/"">Should Elon Musk Let Someone Else Run Tesla?</A></EM>)</P><P> </P><P><EM>In 400,000 years, <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels have never breached 300 ppm. Now they're at 400 ppm. Source: <A href=""https://<mark>climate</mark>.nasa.gov/vital-signs/<mark>carbon</mark>-dioxide/"" target=""_blank"">NASA</A>.</EM></P><P>The worst-case scenario? &quot;More displacement and destruction than all the wars in history combined.&quot; Musk added that 97% of scientists see the worst-case scenario as the most plausible. One reason is that we've &quot;designed civilization to be super-sensitive to <mark>climate change</mark>&quot;: we build our cities on the coasts, and a quarter of the globe lives within 100 kilometers of the ocean. Donald Trump's <A href=""/news/four-stocks-could-be-affected-paris-agreement-decision-fslr-btu/"">promise to ditch</A> the Paris accords earned predictable opprobrium from Musk, who announced that he would leave presidential advisory councils.</P><P><EM>Via <A href=""https://electrek.co/2015/12/03/elon-musk-we-designed-civilization-to-be-super-sensitive-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" target=""_blank"">Electrek</A>.</EM></P><P>Musk advocated a <mark>carbon</mark> tax at the Sorbonne, but he's pursued DIY solutions while he waits for politicians to act. He founded SolarCity, a maker of rooftop solar panels, to reduce household consumption of fossil fuel-derived energy. He founded Tesla, an electric car company, with a similar motive. He merged the two companies in November so as to create &quot;an integrated <mark>sustainable</mark> energy company.&quot; Battery technology, which is relevant to both solar power and electric cars, is a particular focus of the company, since poor energy storage is a nagging impediment to wider adoption of renewable energy sources.</P><P>To critics, the merger amounted to a bailout for struggling SolarCity.</P><H2>Artificial Intelligence</H2><P>Musk is concerned about <mark>climate change</mark>, but he's positively terrified of artificial intelligence. He has suggested there &quot;should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish,&quot; by which he means &quot;summoning the demon&quot; of artificial intelligence. On September 4, a few days after a North Korean Hwasong-12 missile flew over northern Japan, Musk took to Twitter to <A href=""https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/904641970349285376"" target=""_blank"">call</A> the ornery hermit kingdom &quot;low on our list of concerns for civilizational existential risk.&quot; He <A href=""https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/904638455761612800"" target=""_blank"">argued instead</A>: &quot;competition for AI at national level most likely cause of WW3 imo.&quot;</P><P>Musk is not the only public figure haunted by the specter of hyperintelligent machines whose plans may or may not involve human happiness or survival. Stephen Hawking has warned that AI &quot;could spell the end of the human race.&quot;</P><P>The entrepreneur has taken his accustomed route to solving &quot;our biggest existential threat&quot;: founding things. He co-chairs OpenAI, a non-profit dedicated to &quot;discovering and enacting the path to safe artificial general intelligence&quot; with Y Combinator president Sam Altman. He also founded Neuralink, a project involving &quot;neural lace,&quot; the integration of human brains and artificial intelligence; the goal is to be to help human beings keep pace with sentient robots, and cure Parkinsons, epilepsy and paralysis in the process. For a 36,000-word disquisition on the &quot;wizard hat&quot; startup's aims, see <A href=""http://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html"" target=""_blank"">here</A>. (See also, <EM><A href=""/news/elon-musk-launches-new-company-save-humans-ai-tsla-fb/"">Elon Musk Launches New Company to Save Humans From AI</A>.</EM>)</P><P>Musk has described OpenAI as a vehicle to democratize artificial intelligence: &quot;you would have your AI agent, everybody would have their AI agent.&quot; That way, &quot;if somebody did try to something really terrible, then the collective will of others could overcome that bad actor.&quot; (See also, <EM><A href=""/articles/investing/030316/how-elon-musk-will-revolutionize-modern-world.asp"">How Elon Musk Will Revolutionize the Modern World</A>.</EM>)</P><P>He apparently does not see a scenario in which AI is kept entirely in check, aiming instead to contain its effects. Still, developing AI technologies could be seen as a peculiar way of counteracting the threat of AI: something like drawing a pentagram, securing a copy of the Necronomicon and experimenting with various candle arrangements – just to be sure no one summons a demon. His investments in DeepMind, a British AI firm acquired by Alphabet Inc. (<A href=""/markets/stocks/goog/"">GOOG</A>, <A href=""/markets/stocks/googl/"">GOOGL</A>), and <A href=""http://www.vicarious.com/"" target=""_blank"">Vicarious</A> reinforce that perception. </P><H2>&quot;Something Strange&quot;</H2><P>If the possibility of artificial intelligence disturbs Musk, the absence of organic, nonhuman intelligence is just as bad. &quot;Where are the #%*&gt; aliens?&quot; he asked in a recent tweet, referencing a study that found, &quot;as long as the probability that a habitable zone planet develops a technological species is larger than ~10^-24 [0.000000000000000000000001], humanity is not the only time technological intelligence has evolved.&quot;</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""twitter-tweet"" data-lang=""en""><P dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"" xml:lang=""en"">Where are the #%*&gt; aliens? <A href=""https://t.co/FDuJIdwgrN"">https://t.co/FDuJIdwgrN</A></P><P>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <A href=""https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/845172927892897792"">March 24, 2017</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>To Musk's mind, this is ominous in the extreme. If intelligent aliens have probably evolved, and we haven't found them, they are likely dead. &quot;Something strange has to happen to civilizations, and I mean strange in a bad way,' Musk <A href=""https://aeon.co/essays/elon-musk-puts-his-case-for-a-multi-planet-civilisation"" target=""_blank"">told</A> Aeon, adding, &quot;it could be that there are a whole lot of dead, one-planet civilisations.&quot; Gamma rays? Supernovae? Devouring suns, celestial collisions, supervolcanoes, oh my? Musk did not specify (his interviewer for the story supplied those scenarios, to which you might as well add war – nuclear or biological, perhaps with a predatory alien supercivilization – and, of course, <mark>climate change</mark> and AI).</P><P>It doesn't much matter what particular doomsday scenario comes to pass, the solution is not to put all your eggs in one basket. Musk proposes that we take the next evolutionary step, one he puts on par with life's colonization of land and the advent of consciousness: we must become a multiplanetary species. Hence <A href=""/articles/small-business/011717/space-exploration-technologies-corp.asp"">SpaceX</A>, a rocket company he founded after learning that – for all the presidential speechifying that has periodically bubbled up since the Cold War – NASA had no concrete plans to put people on Mars. (See also, <EM><A href=""/news/spacex-send-passengers-lunar-voyage-next-year-tsla/"">SpaceX to Send Passengers on Lunar Voyage Next Year</A>.</EM>)</P><H2>The Petri Dish Tips Over</H2><P>Of course there's a simple answer to the where-is-everybody conundrum, one that doesn't necessitate a litany of civilization-annihilating worst-case scenarios. The intelligent aliens are out there, alive and well and swirling us around &quot;like mould in a petri dish&quot; or bits in a computer simulation. (See also, <EM><A href=""/university/elon-musk-biography/"">Elon Musk Biography</A>.</EM>)</P><P>&quot;The absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation.... Like when you're playing an adventure game, and you can see the stars in the background, but you can't ever get there,&quot; Musk told Aeon. He pointed to the gulf between Pong, released a mere 40 years ago, and the computer games now available as evidence that a planet-sized simulation containing us is perfectly achievable. </P><P>Musk has not publicly discussed the possibility that our simulation might be unplugged, or our petri dish tipped over. He has not announced any ventures designed to counteract these eventualities. Nor has he responded to a recent study <A href=""https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics/physicists-find-we-re-not-living-in-a-computer-simulation"" target=""_blank"">finding</A> it would be physically impossible to construct a computer able to simulate a certain quantum phenomenon that is documented in our presumably-not-simulated world. </P><H2>Traffic</H2><P>There is one last problem that drives Musk to found companies. Traffic. </P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""twitter-tweet"" data-lang=""en""><P dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"" xml:lang=""en"">Traffic is driving me nuts.

But Musk nonetheless appears serious about his tunnel project, dubbed The Boring Company. (See also, <A href=""/news/elon-musk-starting-boring-company-tsla/""><EM>Is Elon Musk Starting a Boring Company?</EM></A>)</P><P>He has also floated the idea of a &quot;hyperloop,&quot; a mode of transportation that uses low-pressure tubes to hurtle pods of people and freight at jet engine speeds. Musk has mostly left the concept alone, allowing others to develop prototypes. SpaceX is reportedly building a track to host a pod competition. (See also, <EM><A href=""/news/hyperloop-one-releases-images-test-track-tsla/"">Hyperloop One Releases Images of Test Track</A>.</EM>)</P><P>Musk's hatred of congestion is apparently selective: Tesla's own parking lot is notoriously clogged, with an <A href=""https://www.instagram.com/teslaparkinglot/"" target=""_blank"">Instagram account</A> devoted solely to documenting the miserable morass confronting Musk's employees every morning when they arrive to work. But that issue is low on Musk's list of concerns for civilizational existential risk.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
