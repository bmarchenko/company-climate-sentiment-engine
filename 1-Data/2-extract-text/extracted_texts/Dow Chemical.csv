The Associated Press (AP) recently learned EPA Administrator <A href=""https://inhabitat.com/tag/scott-pruitt/"" target=""_blank"">Scott Pruitt</A> met privately with Dow CEO Andrew Liveris shortly before the decision to not ban the <A href=""https://inhabitat.com/tag/pesticide/"" target=""_blank"">pesticide</A>.</P><P>Polluting industries champion Pruitt met with Liveris on March 9 for around half an hour in Houston, according to Pruitt’s schedule.

The companies asked them &quot;to set aside&quot; the results of government studies the companies contend are fundamentally flawed.</P><P class=""p-text""><mark>Dow Chemical</mark> wrote a $1 million check to help underwrite Trump's inaugural festivities, and its chairman and CEO, Andrew Liveris, heads a White House manufacturing working group.</P><P class=""p-text"">The industry's request comes after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced last month he was reversing an Obama-era effort to bar the use of Dow's chlorpyrifos pesticide on food after recent peer-reviewed studies found that even tiny levels of exposure could hinder the development of children's brains. In his prior job as Oklahoma's attorney general, Pruitt often aligned himself in legal disputes with the interests of executives and corporations who supported his state campaigns. He filed more than a dozen lawsuits seeking to overturn some of the same regulations he is now charged with enforcing.</P><P class=""p-text"">Pruitt declined to answer questions from reporters Wednesday as he toured a polluted Superfund site in Indiana. Agency spokesman J.P. Freire later told AP that Pruitt won't &quot;prejudge&quot; any potential rule-making decisions as &quot;we are trying to restore regulatory sanity to EPA's work.&quot;</P><P class=""p-text"">The letters to Cabinet heads, dated April 13, were obtained by The Associated Press. As with the recent human studies of chlorpyrifos, Dow hired its own scientists who produced a lengthy rebuttal to the government studies.</P><P class=""p-text"">Over the past four years, federal scientists have compiled an official record running more than 10,000 pages indicating the three pesticides under review — chlorpyrifos, diazinon and malathion — pose a risk to nearly every endangered species they studied. Regulators at the three federal agencies, which share responsibilities for enforcing the Endangered Species Act, are close to issuing findings expected to result in new limits on how and where the highly toxic pesticides can be used.</P><DIV id=""module-position-Q4NQaJboiDc"" class=""story-asset oembed-asset""><DIV class=""story-oembed-wrap ""><DIV class=""js-oembed story-oembed story-oembed-usa-today story-oembed-type-link"" data-oembed-type=""link"" data-oembed-provider=""usa-today""><DIV class=""oembed-asset oembed-asset-link oembed-asset-usa-today oembed-simple-link-container""><A href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/03/10/strawberries-and-these-other-foods-have-most-pesticides/98966374/"" data-track-label=""newrecircinline"" class=""oembed-simple-link oembed-link-anchor""><P class=""oembed-link-desc"">Strawberries and these other foods have the most pesticides</P></A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P class=""p-text"">The office of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Natural Marine Fisheries Service, did not respond to emailed questions. A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service, referred questions back to EPA.</P><P class=""p-text"">The EPA's recent biological evaluation of chlorpyrifos found the pesticide is &quot;likely to adversely affect&quot; 1,778 of the 1,835 animals and plants accessed as part of its study, including critically endangered or threatened species of frogs, fish, birds and mammals. Similar results were shown for malathion and diazinon.</P><P class=""p-text"">In a statement, the Dow subsidiary that sells chlorpyrifos said its lawyers asked for the EPA's biological assessment to be withdrawn because its &quot;scientific basis was not reliable.&quot;</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;Dow AgroSciences is committed to the production and marketing of products that will help American farmers feed the world, and do so with full respect for human health and the environment, including endangered and threatened species,&quot; the statement said. &quot;These letters, and the detailed scientific analyses that support them, demonstrate that commitment.&quot;</P><P class=""p-text"">FMC Corp., which sells malathion, said withdrawal of the EPA studies would allow the necessary time for the &quot;best available&quot; scientific data to be compiled.</P><P class=""p-text"">Environmental advocates said Wednesday that criticism of the government's scientists was unfounded. The methods used to conduct EPA's biological evaluations were developed by the National Academy of Sciences.</P><P class=""p-text"">Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said Dow's experts were trying to hold EPA scientists to an unrealistic standard of data collection.</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;You can't just take an endangered fish out of the wild, take it to the lab and then expose it to enough pesticides until it dies to get that sort of data,&quot; Hartl said. &quot;It's wrong morally, and it's illegal.&quot;</P><P class=""p-text"">Organophosphorus gas was originally developed as a chemical weapon by Nazi Germany. Dow has been selling Chlorpyrifos for spraying on citrus fruits, apples, cherries and other crops since the 1960s. It is among the most widely used agricultural pesticides in the United States, with Dow selling about 5 million pounds domestically each year.</P><P class=""p-text"">As a result, traces of the chemical are commonly found in sources of drinking water. A 2012 study at the University of California, Berkeley found that 87 percent of umbilical-cord blood samples tested from newborn babies contained detectable levels of chlorpyrifos.</P><P class=""p-text"">Dow, which spent more than $13.6 million on lobbying in 2016, has long wielded substantial political power in the nation's capital. When Trump signed an executive order in February mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations, he gave the pen as a souvenir to Dow's chief executive and thanked Liveris.</P><P class=""p-text"">Rachelle Schikorra, the director of public affairs for <mark>Dow Chemical</mark>, said any suggestion that the company's $1 million donation to Trump's inaugural committee was intended to help influence regulatory decisions is &quot;completely off the mark.&quot;</P><P class=""p-text p-text-last"" id=""article-body-p-last"">&quot;Dow maintains and is committed to the highest standard of ethical conduct in all such activity,&quot; Schikorra said.</P><DIV id=""module-position-Q4NQaJa921M"" class=""story-asset inline-share-tools-asset""><DIV class=""inline-share-tools asset-inline-share-tools asset-inline-share-tools-bottom""><SPAN class=""inline-share-btn inline-share-btn-facebook"" data-share-method=""facebook"" data-uotrack=""InlineShareFacebookBtn""><SPAN class=""inline-share-btn-label inline-share-btn-label-facebook"">CONNECT</SPAN></SPAN><A class=""inline-share-btn inline-share-btn-twitter"" data-share-method=""twitter"" data-uotrack=""InlineShareTwitterLink"" data-popup-width=""550"" data-popup-height=""450"" href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/2p0iF31&amp;text=Dow%20Chemical%20urges%20Trump%20administration%20to%20ignore%20pesticide%20findings&amp;via=usatoday"" target=""_blank"" data-popup="""" rel=""nofollow""><SPAN class=""inline-share-btn-label inline-share-btn-label-twitter"">TWEET</SPAN></A><A class=""inline-share-btn inline-share-btn-linkedin"" data-share-method=""linkedin"" data-popup-width=""600"" data-popup-height=""455"" data-uotrack=""UtilityBarFlyoutLinkedInLink"" href=""http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/2p0iF31&amp;mini=true"" target=""_blank"" data-popup="""" rel=""nofollow""><SPAN class=""inline-share-btn-label inline-share-btn-label-linkedin"">LINKEDIN</SPAN></A><SPAN class=""inline-share-btn inline-share-btn-comments"" data-share-method=""comments"" data-uotrack=""InlineShareCommentsBtn""><SPAN class=""inline-share-count inline-share-count-comments"">

To find out more about how companies can apply these levers, see the related opinion piece, “<A href=""#putting"">Putting it into practice</A>.”</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN>(Exhibit 4). For example, 94 percent say their companies have integrated sustainability into strategic planning, versus 53 percent of all other respondents. Compared with the integration of sustainability into other processes, however, the leaders’ supply chains and budgets are less integrated; respondents at other companies report this pattern as well. In addition, respondents in the leaders’ group are more likely than other respondents to report that their companies are pursuing each of the 13 actions related to sustainability listed in the survey, and they rate themselves more effective at taking action, relative to competitors, more often than the rest of respondents do.</P><FIGURE id=""exhibit-main_0_ctl24_h4Headline"" class=""text-s exhibit "" data-module=""Exhibit"" aria-labelledby=""main_0_ctl24_h4Headline"" aria-describedby=""main_0_ctl24_divDescription""><FIGCAPTION class=""metadata""><DIV class=""eyebrow"">Exhibit 4</DIV><HEADER id=""main_0_ctl24_h4Headline"" class=""exhibit-label"">
                Leading with action
            </HEADER></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Executives in the leaders’ group are also more likely to say their companies are taking higher-level, more strategic actions: much higher shares of leaders are managing their business portfolios to capture trends in sustainability and committing R&amp;D resources to <mark>sustainable</mark> products. Furthermore, just 9 percent of respondents at these companies say they have sustainability programs in place to respond to regulatory requirements, compared with 25 percent of all other respondents. Those in the leaders’ group are more likely to say instead that sustainability is aligned with their goals, mission, and values (59 percent versus 28 percent of all others) and that it strengthens their competitive position (43 percent versus 24 percent).</P><P>It’s likely related that executives in the leaders’ group are more than twice as likely as all others to say their companies capture value from sustainability opportunities. Indeed, 30 percent say they are capturing all the value they can, versus 9 percent of all others. And while all respondents struggle with the pressure of short-term earnings performance as a barrier to value creation, the leaders struggle less with leadership, systems, and processes that enable organizations to drive value through sustainability (Exhibit 5).</P><FIGURE id=""exhibit-main_0_ctl25_h4Headline"" class=""text-s exhibit "" data-module=""Exhibit"" aria-labelledby=""main_0_ctl25_h4Headline"" aria-describedby=""main_0_ctl25_divDescription""><FIGCAPTION class=""metadata""><DIV class=""eyebrow"">Exhibit 5</DIV><HEADER id=""main_0_ctl25_h4Headline"" class=""exhibit-label"">
                Fewer barriers for leaders
            </HEADER></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Executives whose companies fall into the leaders’ group also report that employees at all levels are far more knowledgeable about their companies’ sustainability activities—and that sustainability is more important for attracting and retaining employees—than respondents at other companies.<A href=""#"" class=""link-footnote"" onclick=""return false;"" rel=""#footnote9""><SUP>9</SUP></A><SPAN class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote9"" style=""display: none;""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">9.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text""> Within the leaders’ group, 23 percent of respondents say their companies’ performance on sustainability issues is one of the most important factors for attracting and retaining employees, while 5 percent of all other respondents say the same. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN>This finding suggests that the integration of sustainability extends far beyond business practices at these companies.</P><P>It’s important to note that the mix of industries represented in the leaders’ group differs from the full group of respondents to the survey. A handful of industries—arguably those with a higher impact on environmental issues such as resource use and emissions, whose need to be more proactive on sustainability to effectively manage their future business is more urgent—are overrepresented: energy, extractive industries, manufacturing, and transportation. Relatively few respondents from finance, retail, and business, legal, and professional services are in the leaders group.</P></H3><H3 class=""multipagetitle"">Value creation and industry<P>The fact that some industries are overrepresented in the leaders’ group highlights differences in emphasis on and effective management of sustainability across industries. This carries over to value creation. Overall, the relationship between sustainability and quantifiable value is still somewhat unclear, executives indicate: about one-third of respondents say they don’t know how much sustainability initiatives add to shareholder value at their companies. In addition, the share that rate sustainability’s contribution to short-term value as positive has only inched up since last year’s survey, to 48 percent.</P><P>However, respondents do cite several different levers for value creation over the next five years. Among the top are managing corporate reputation, capturing sustainability trends in the business portfolio, and committing R&amp;D resources to <mark>sustainable</mark> products; across industries, the relative importance of each effort varies (Exhibit 6).</P><FIGURE id=""exhibit-main_0_ctl26_h4Headline"" class=""text-s exhibit "" data-module=""Exhibit"" aria-labelledby=""main_0_ctl26_h4Headline"" aria-describedby=""main_0_ctl26_divDescription""><FIGCAPTION class=""metadata""><DIV class=""eyebrow"">Exhibit 6</DIV><HEADER id=""main_0_ctl26_h4Headline"" class=""exhibit-label"">
                Value varies by industry
            </HEADER></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Respondents at consumer and B2B companies diverge on the levers that could drive longer-term value creation. Respondents in both groups expect reputation to add a similar level of significant value, or more than 11 percent of shareholder value—indeed, it’s the most frequently selected action by respondents at consumer companies. Among B2B respondents, however, the highest share (23 percent) say managing their business portfolios to capture sustainability trends adds significant value to companies in their industries, compared with 15 percent of consumer respondents. Achieving higher prices or greater market share through <mark>sustainable</mark> products, committing R&amp;D resources, and responding to regulations has more value potential for B2B companies, executives say, while those at consumer companies see more potential in managing sustainability through the value chain, water use, and waste.</P><P>Across industries, executives also differ in how they view barriers to value creation. Those at extractive firms point to a lack of capabilities (25 percent versus 15 percent of all respondents) and lack of incentives tied to sustainability performance (42 percent versus 32 percent) as being bigger barriers than they are for respondents in other industries. Higher shares of transportation respondents than the average also cite lack of incentives (45 percent), while fewer executives at energy firms select most of the barriers presented, perhaps suggesting that they’ve been thinking about sustainability and value longer than others. Some in the energy sector do still cite key performance indicators (KPIs) and integrating sustainability into their performance management systems as concerns. Executives at retail firms are more likely to report barriers—except for organizational structure and a disconnected sustainability department—than the average.</P></H3><H2>Looking ahead</H2><UL class=""leftContentUL""><LI><P>Companies are not doing as much to integrate sustainability into internal communications or employee engagement as they are into other areas of business, such as strategic planning. With 53 percent of respondents saying company performance on sustainability is at least somewhat important to attracting and retaining employees, companies that take action are more likely to gain an advantage in employee retention. The leaders are better at engaging employees on this issue (and at keeping employees at all levels more informed), suggesting that it’s possible to make the most of this opportunity in sustainability.</P></LI><LI><P>Our experience in working with companies in different industries on sustainability aligns with the survey findings that different industries use different levers (growth, return on capital, and risk management) to create significant value. There’s no single way to create value from sustainability, so knowing where the biggest opportunities for value creation are in an industry—and where the risks and barriers lie—can serve as a guide for developing sustainability strategies.</P></LI><LI><P>Coupled with the shift in reasons for pursuing sustainability, from reputation management to operational improvements and new growth opportunities, the overall high degree of integration seems to indicate that companies have become more businesslike about their sustainability agenda. Most companies, however, are still struggling to factor sustainability into the “hard” areas of their business, such as supply chain and the budget, so there is still a lot of potential to drive further integration and increased value creation. Where leaders and all others diverge most is around KPIs, organizational structure, and leadership engagement; these may be high-potential areas for companies striving to become sustainability leaders.</P></LI></UL><H3 class=""multipagetitle"">Putting it into practice<P><I>Companies should integrate environmental, social, and governance issues into their business model—and act on them.</I></P><P><B>Sheila Bonini and Stephan Görner</B></P><P>Sustainability has long been on the agenda at many companies, but for decades their environmental, social, and governance activities have been disconnected from core strategy. Most still take a fragmented, reactive approach—launching ad hoc initiatives to enhance their “green” credentials, to comply with regulations, or to deal with emergencies—rather than treating sustainability as an issue with a direct impact on business results.<A href=""#"" class=""link-footnote"" onclick=""return false;"" rel=""#footnote10""><SUP>1</SUP></A><SPAN class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote10"" style=""display: none;""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">1.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text""> According to McKinsey’s 2011 survey on sustainability, just 36 percent of executives say their companies have a strategic approach to it, with a defined set of initiatives. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P>That’s no longer enough. Material risks not only to a company’s reputation but also to the bottom line come from many, often unpredictable directions in an era of constrained resources and tighter regulatory requirements, as well as growing demand for <mark>sustainable</mark> products and services, good corporate governance, and social responsibility. Where such challenges arise, opportunities also lie: McKinsey estimates that the clean-tech product market, for example, will reach $1.6 trillion by 2020, up from $670 billion in 2010. The World Resources Institute estimates that people at the bottom of the income pyramid, who earn less than $3,000 a year, embody a global market of more than $5 trillion.<A href=""#"" class=""link-footnote"" onclick=""return false;"" rel=""#footnote11""><SUP>2</SUP></A><SPAN class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote11"" style=""display: none;""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">2.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text""> Allen L.

We believe the trend is clear: more businesses will have to take a long-term strategic view of sustainability and build it into the key value creation levers that drive returns on capital, growth, and risk management (Exhibit 7), as well as the key organizational elements that support the levers. Each company’s path to capturing value from sustainability will be unique, but these underlying elements can serve as a universal point from which to get started.</P><FIGURE id=""exhibit-main_0_ctl27_h4Headline"" class=""text-s exhibit "" data-module=""Exhibit"" aria-labelledby=""main_0_ctl27_h4Headline"" aria-describedby=""main_0_ctl27_divDescription""><FIGCAPTION class=""metadata""><DIV class=""eyebrow"">Exhibit 7</DIV><HEADER id=""main_0_ctl27_h4Headline"" class=""exhibit-label"">

            </HEADER></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></H3><H2>Approaching sustainability</H2><P>Our survey produced insights into the specific practices of a small group of companies that treat sustainability holistically. At all of them, it is a top-tier item on the CEO’s agenda, a formal program is in place to address it, and executives embed it in business practices and manage it actively. Much higher shares of respondents at these leading companies report that they are pursuing each kind of value-creating activity related to sustainability and integrating the organizational elements—mission and values, systems and processes, internal and external leadership, and organizational design—that support such initiatives.</P><P>The leading companies from our survey can thus serve as a model for others. Make no mistake, however: capturing sustainability’s full value potential is complicated. In essence, a company must first determine its baseline performance on sustainability issues and then decide on a portfolio of initiatives to create value in those areas. But while many companies understand the impact of their own operations on issues from <mark>carbon</mark> emissions to human rights, they often have little or no understanding of the impact of the entire value chain.<A href=""#"" class=""link-footnote"" onclick=""return false;"" rel=""#footnote12""><SUP>3</SUP></A><SPAN class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote12"" style=""display: none;""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">3.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text""> Seventy-eight percent of respondents at leading companies say they have mostly or completely integrated sustainability into the management of their supply chains; 37 percent of all other respondents say their companies have done so. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN>Moreover, most companies do not actively seek opportunities to invest in any area of sustainability<A href=""#"" class=""link-footnote"" onclick=""return false;"" rel=""#footnote13""><SUP>4</SUP></A><SPAN class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote13"" style=""display: none;""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">4.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text""> According to McKinsey’s 2010 survey on sustainability, 88 percent of respondents at leading companies strongly agree that they actively seek opportunities to invest in sustainability, versus 23 percent of all other respondents.

An extractive-services company,<A href=""#"" class=""link-footnote"" onclick=""return false;"" rel=""#footnote14""><SUP>5</SUP></A><SPAN class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote14"" style=""display: none;""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">5.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text""> This group includes survey respondents from the coal, metal, and other mining industries; oil and gas extraction; petroleum and natural-gas distribution; and petroleum refining. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN>for example, could significantly reduce its costs through better management of energy and water. A retail company could reduce its resource intensity and costs by revamping its supply chain, since the biggest environmental impact within that sector can often be traced to raw materials, such as the agricultural products used in food or apparel. An energy company may have more opportunities than companies in other industries to create value through new products—for example, by commercializing investments in smart grids.</P><FIGURE id=""exhibit-main_0_ctl28_h4Headline"" class=""text-s exhibit "" data-module=""Exhibit"" aria-labelledby=""main_0_ctl28_h4Headline"" aria-describedby=""main_0_ctl28_divDescription""><FIGCAPTION class=""metadata""><DIV class=""eyebrow"">Exhibit 8</DIV><HEADER id=""main_0_ctl28_h4Headline"" class=""exhibit-label"">
                Industry-specific opportunities
            </HEADER></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H2>Creating value</H2><P>Integrating sustainability into strategic initiatives is especially important because these issues play out over the long term. It’s easier for companies where they are core concerns to understand trends and make strategic bets in advance of consumer preferences, stakeholder pressure, or regulation. GE, for example, placed early bets on <mark>climate change</mark>: in 2004, before Al Gore and Hurricane Katrina made this a top-of-mind issue, the company resolved to double its research investments and sales in clean technology. It also promised to “green” its own operations. As a result, GE’s Ecomagination division has been a tremendous growth engine, with product sales reaching $18 billion in 2009. Other companies too have found instructive ways to build sustainability into drivers of value.</P><H3>Returns on capital</H3><P>Most companies creating value through sustainability look first to improving returns on capital, which often means reducing operating costs through improved natural-resource management (such as energy use and waste). <mark>Dow Chemical</mark>, for example, reported that it invested less than $2 billion since 1994 to improve its resource efficiency. To date the company has saved more than $9.8 billion from reduced energy consumption and water waste in its manufacturing processes, even as it continues to develop <mark>innovation</mark>s. In 1996, through a separate initiative, Dow also created a set of goals for environmental, health, and safety issues, and it has ensured their integration into the company’s processes by tracking progress with clear metrics. As a result Dow, with a 20 percent reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions, has gone well beyond Kyoto Protocol<A href=""#"" class=""link-footnote"" onclick=""return false;"" rel=""#footnote15""><SUP>6</SUP></A><SPAN class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote15"" style=""display: none;""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">6.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text""><I>Kyoto protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark></I>, United Nations, 1998. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN>targets.<A href=""#"" class=""link-footnote"" onclick=""return false;"" rel=""#footnote16""><SUP>7</SUP></A><SPAN class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote16"" style=""display: none;""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">7.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text""><I>Mid-point Report: 2015 Sustainability Goals Update, 4Q 2010</I>, <mark>Dow Chemical</mark>, February 2011. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P>Companies are also driving down costs by systematically managing their value chains. Wal-Mart, for example, expects to generate $12 billion in global supply chain savings by 2013 through a packaging “scorecard” that could reduce packaging across the company’s global supply chain by 5 percent from 2006 levels. Moreover, companies can add value by improving employee retention or motivation through sustainability activities or by raising prices or achieving higher market share with new or existing <mark>sustainable</mark> products. Whole Foods Market, for instance, raised its sales by 13 percent a year from 2005 to 2009, in an economy experiencing single-digit growth.</P><H3>Growth</H3><P>Companies that rigorously pursue sustainability also regularly revisit their business portfolios to determine the potential impact of trends (such as existing or potential <mark>climate change</mark> regulations) that could lead to new growth opportunities. Waste Management, for instance, reinvented itself as a provider of integrated environmental offerings by adding waste reduction and waste-to-energy solutions to its services. Companies also screen rigorously for unmet needs created by sustainability trends in line with their strategies and identify potential customer segments. ArcelorMittal, for example, embedded sustainability in its organizational design through a department for scientific analyses of the life cycles of steel products. The department creates offerings that minimize steel’s negative environmental impacts—one result of the company’s investment in innovative solutions. GlaxoSmithKline is looking not only to philanthropy but also to its business model in addressing diseases in less-developed markets. By adopting a range of flexible pricing models for patented medicines and vaccines so that they’re affordable for customers in those countries—yet still profitable—the company hopes to garner a significant share of sales in potential new markets.</P><H3>Risk management</H3><P>Better management of risks that arise from sustainability issues begins with detecting key risks of operational disruptions from <mark>climate change</mark>, resource scarcity, or community issues (such as boycotts or delays in getting permits for manufacturing). Faced with potential supply constraints, Nestlé, for example, launched a plan in 2009 that coordinates activities to promote <mark>sustainable</mark> cocoa: producing 12 million stronger and more productive plants over the next ten years, teaching local farmers efficient and <mark>sustainable</mark> methods, purchasing beans from farms that use <mark>sustainable</mark> practices, and working with organizations to help tackle issues like child labor and poor access to health care and education. The mining giant BHP Billiton managed its exposure to emerging regulations by systematically reducing its emissions.</P><P>The choice for companies today is not if, but <I>how</I>, they should manage their sustainability activities. Companies can choose to see this agenda as a necessary evil—a matter of compliance or a risk to be managed while they get on with the business of business—or they can think of it as a novel way to open up new business opportunities while creating value for society.</P><FOOTER id=""main_0_divAboutAuthors"" role=""contentinfo"" class=""about-authors text-s""><H4 class=""headline"">About the author(s)</H4><P><B>Sheila Bonini</B> is a consultant in McKinsey’s Silicon Valley office; <B>Stephan Görner</B>, collaborator with Bonini on “Putting it into practice,” is a director in the Sydney office.</P></FOOTER><ASIDE id=""main_0_articleShare2_articleActions"" class=""share icon-brand-colors"" data-module=""ShareFactory"" aria-labelledby=""share-label""><HEADER id=""share-label"" class=""visually-hidden"">Article Actions</HEADER></ASIDE></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

Those in favour of the agreement included Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, a career property developer, and the secretary of state and former chief executive of ExxonMobil, Rex Tillerson. </P><P>The lifelong political operatives in the opposite camp were Scott Pruitt of the Environmental Protection Agency, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Mike Pence, the vice president. They said the accord threatened the US economy and was based on questionable science, arguments Trump himself had made during the 2016 election campaign.  </P><P>It might seem surprising that the advisers with business backgrounds were the ones who wanted the US to maintain its commitment to cutting emissions. Of course Trump, the other businessman in the group, opted to leave the agreement. But his decision went against what has come to be the mainstream view of <mark>climate change</mark> in US corporate circles. </P><P>At the same time that Tillerson and Kushner were making their case, 30 chief executives of large corporations listed on the New York Stock Exchange including Goldman Sachs, <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> Company and Coca Cola <A href=""http://bteam.org/announcements/30-major-ceos-call-on-trump-stay-in-paris/"">took out an ad</A> in the Wall Street Journal urging the president not to withdraw. </P><P>This chimes with new research findings that we are presenting at the <A href=""https://councilforeuropeanstudies.org/conferences/upcoming-conferences/11-meetings-and-conferences/269-24th-international-conference-of-europeanists-call-for-proposals"">International Conference of Europeanists</A> being held at the University of Glasgow. These <A href=""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0007650315613966"">confirm that</A> multinationals are heavily engaged with environmental issues. On the other hand, they have largely neglected calls to discharge social responsibilities through the likes of the living wage, collective bargaining or taking action against forced labour in their supply chains. Why this difference? And what can be done about it? </P><FIGURE class=""align-center zoomable""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">Greenpeace protesting Donald Trump’s Paris decision.</SPAN><SPAN class=""attribution""><A class=""source"" href=""http://www.epa.eu/politics-photos/citizens-initiative-recall-photos/greenpeace-protests-against-united-state-s-withdrawal-from-the-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-treaty-photos-53561372"">EPA</A></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H2>The research</H2><P>We analysed sustainability reports published by 150 large multinationals from Germany, the UK and the US from the late 1990s until the present. We found that firms from all three countries engaged earlier with environmental than social sustainability issues. They continue to publish higher quality data on their environmental impacts and have more ambitious improvement plans. </P><P>And firms from all three countries have converged around common environmental commitments while their commitments for most social issues are still substantially determined by the laws and the state of the debate in their home <A href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1449403515000478"">countries</A>. </P><P>It is worth emphasising that this commitment to environmental responsibility is a sea change: for years big business, perhaps mainstream corporate America in particular, fought against <mark>climate</mark> action. Now many of these businesses are backing (some forms of) global <mark>climate</mark> regulation even in the absence of pressure from the US government. </P><P>This difference in attitudes to their environmental and social impacts is despite the fact that activists and NGOs have promoted the two issues in a similar manner. In both cases they have used voluntary certification schemes along the lines of the Fairtrade logo, for example.  </P><P>According to interviews we carried out with a small sample of multinationals’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) managers, the difference is that their employers have come to view <mark>climate change</mark> as a future business risk. Investors are increasingly demanding evidence of plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To help guide them, global standards to measure this risk <A href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09638180802489121"">are</A> being <A href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09644016.2015.1051325"">developed</A>. </P><P>By contrast, labour rights issues are rarely seen by business as market imperatives. There is <A href=""http://www.ilo.int/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---travail/documents/publication/wcms_162117.pdf"">little evidence that</A> market actors such as the investor community exert significant pressure on multinationals to improve their practices in this area. </P><FIGURE class=""align-right zoomable""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">Pink pulpit.</SPAN><SPAN class=""attribution""><A class=""source"" href=""https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/paris-france-apr-24-2017-emmanuel-639839071?src=kDs8pcKrYz469Hbde8gZpw-2-19"">Hadrian</A></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>To explore this difference, we analysed how the Financial Times has covered <mark>climate change</mark> and the living wage – two prominent sustainability issues from opposite sides of the divide. By looking at coverage over the same period as the corporate reports, we found that the FT’s business section had paid far greater attention to <mark>climate change</mark> than wage equality – even after the financial crisis of 2008-09. </P><P>At one point in 2007, the FT business pages published more than 1,400 articles on <mark>climate change</mark>. The highest point of its coverage of wage-related issues was as long ago as 1997, and amounted to just 268 articles. </P><P>This corroborates what the CSR managers had suggested in our interviews. Investors and customers seem to be putting much more pressure on multinationals to deal with emissions and more broadly <mark>climate change</mark>. They appear to have turned these issues into a nascent, albeit still contested, market imperative. </P><P>Prominent business actors still frequently deny that addressing wage inequality is their primary responsibility. Warren Buffett, the star American investor, recently came out against excessive increases to the minimum wage in an <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/better-than-raising-the-minimum-wage-1432249927"">op-ed piece</A> for the Wall Street Journal. The working poor would be better served by earned income tax credits rather than “distortions to the market”, he argued. </P><P>If firms’ sense of social responsibility is ever to catch up with their sense of environmental responsibility, these kinds of attitudes will have to change. Persuading investors that labour rights issues are in the interests of big business is a major part of the battle. If it becomes the same kind of mainstay in the international business press as <mark>climate change</mark>, things might begin to look entirely different. </P><P><EM>This article is part of a series on sustainability and transformation in today’s Europe, published in collaboration with <A href=""http://www.europenowjournal.org"">EuropeNow Journal</A> and the <A href=""https://councilforeuropeanstudies.org"">Council for European Studies (CES)</A> at Columbia University.

The Nature Conservancy, which is responsible for protecting a hundred and nineteen million acres in thirty-five countries, is the biggest environmental nongovernmental organization in the world. Tercek, accompanied by two colleagues, had come to Freeport because the facility—a welter of ethylene crackers and smokestacks built next to a river that flows into the Gulf of Mexico—is at the center of a pilot collaboration that he hopes will reshape conservation. The key idea is to create tools that can assign monetary value to natural resources. Tercek, a former partner at Goldman Sachs, thinks that environmental organizations rely on fuzzy science and fail to harness the power of markets. With the help of sound metrics drawn from the world of finance—“a higher level of accountability,” in his words—some of the ecological harm caused by the very same corporations can be undone. Nudging big business in a green direction, he believes, can do far more good than simply cordoning off parcels of Paradise.</P><P>It was a chilly February day, the wind coming from the west. On the horizon, smoke curled from a brushfire; some of Dow’s tankers, part of the largest privately owned rail fleet in the country, trundled down their tracks. Tercek, who is fifty-seven, is a practiced listener: during his decades as an investment banker, he has sounded out a lot of executives. He seemed engrossed while a Dow operations manager explained proudly that the chemicals produced in Freeport ended up in “upstream intermediate products that go into all sorts of applications.”</P><P>The pilot program centers on finding ways to help the chemical plant save money by enacting environmental reforms. Tercek’s staff had worked with Dow to produce hard numbers: the rate at which certain trees absorb pollutants; the extent to which a plot of restored wetland can slow a storm surge. “Have we achieved any breakthroughs, to Dow’s way of thinking?” Tercek asked. Calm and conciliatory, he doesn’t question the logic of committing billions of dollars—and using hundreds of tons of dangerous chemicals—to create shatterproof lenses, de-icing fluid, and liquid-crystal displays. In front of us was the Brazoria Reservoir, which is run by Dow; it both cools the plant and makes its way through the local water authority to the taps in surrounding towns. I wondered how safe the arrangement was, but Tercek asked the Dow team about the numbers: “As businesspeople, you obviously think a lot about the cost of water versus the utility of water. Is that a big deal?”</P><P>Retail environmentalism—coaching individuals to be eco-minded consumers—isn’t his thing. At one point, we discussed whether the train or the plane is the better way to get from Washington, D.C., where the Nature Conservancy’s headquarters are, to New York, where much of the money Tercek needs to raise is made. He told me that he was “something of an expert” on the commute, and brought up speed and weather considerations, but not <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. “Should you have a fake or real Christmas tree?” he said. “I have no idea.”</P><P>He is six feet four, with an upright carriage and a good smile. The silver Patagonia fleece jacket he wore accentuated the perception that he was someone you were more likely to meet on the chairlift at Telluride than chained to a power-plant fence. He told the Dow people that Nature Conservancy staffers weren’t “egghead conservationists not in touch with the real world.” He went on, “Do we need to get better at putting our analysis and science together? Or did we make the data available—the evidence—that would allow an engineer to be confident?” The numbers were helpful, he was told; the biggest challenge was making Dow employees receptive to the project. “There’s some educating, convincing, that needs to go on,” the operations manager explained. Both sides agreed that a cultural gap was being bridged, and that this would take time. When Tercek asked if global warming preoccupied Dow managers, the vice-president of sustainability answered, “They’re not thinking about <mark>climate change</mark>—they’re filling railcars.”</P><P>Dow’s red-diamond logo is everywhere in Brazoria County, and the company’s reach extends from the Dow Academic Center, a large event space at Brazosport College, to the local aquarium, whose tanks the company fills. After the visit to the reservoir, Dow loaded Tercek and his team onto a bus and gave them a tour. Dow’s Freeport facilities date from the era when nature was something to be openly played with. For a time in the nineteen-forties, the company housed workers in a development called Camp Chemical. One local street is named Chlorine Road, another Glycol Road.</P><P>The bus stopped on top of an earthen levee near a marsh that feeds into a saltwater canal. There were fishing stations, though nobody was out. A Dow publicist said, “The water that comes out of our plant is actually cleaner than the water that comes into it.”</P><P>The Freeport plants began operating during the Second World War. When the Japanese captured much of the Far East, where most rubber-tree plantations were, the U.S. government turned to industry to develop an alternative. Making synthetic rubber requires a lot of water, so a riverside site was ideal. The complex prospered over the ensuing decades, producing millions of gallons of chlorine as well as chemicals used to make paint cleaners, Scrubbing Bubbles, and Saran Wrap. Lately, though, Dow has contended with extreme weather in the region. In 2011, a drought sent the water level in the Brazoria Reservoir down eight feet lower than normal, and a resulting “salt wedge”—Gulf water seeping up the river—put the reservoir out of commission for months. The company traditionally dealt with such problems by reining in nature—building seawalls and other stopgaps—but Dow wondered if longer-term remedies were possible. “We will be here forever,” the operations manager said. “We have to make this work.”</P><P>Chemical plants are volatile places, and individual components are separated from one another and buffered from residential areas, allowing nature to thrive in the gaps. We resumed touring the marsh; looking out the bus window, we saw egrets, blue herons, and roseate spoonbills, their stalky legs bathed in the froth whipped by the wind. Deer live inside the plant’s fence, and alligators can be found in a sediment pool just inside the gates. Nevertheless, according to the most recent Environmental Protection Agency data, the Freeport plant is the third-worst dioxin polluter in the country.</P><P>A goal of the collaboration between Dow and the Nature Conservancy is to create software that helps a company assess its natural resources so that they can be compared with man-made assets. What is a swarm of wild bees worth? One way to answer this question is to determine the cost of pollinating a crop with managed honeybees. To assess the value of a clean river to a soda bottler, you could tabulate the price of purifying a gallon of polluted water. The assumption is that if you want companies to care about nature you must put a price tag on it. Otherwise, as one Nature Conservancy economist told me, “it implicitly gets a value of zero.” The idea is not new: for two decades, New York City has been buying up land in its watershed or paying property owners to stop polluting, because the cost is lower than building the purification plants that it would otherwise need. But the Dow collaboration extends the principle much further. The key piece of software, still under development, is the Ecosystem Services Identification and Inventory program, which will make it easy for engineers—ideally, in the field, with a tablet—to enter data about a company’s natural resources. The Nature Conservancy plans to make the software publicly available. “There is no other tool like it,” Tercek told me.</P><P>Dow, partly through its foundation, paid ten million dollars to fund the partnership. Upon announcing the collaboration, in 2011, a Conservancy spokesperson declared that “nature is a source for <mark>sustainable</mark> business value,” and the chairman of Dow expressed hope that the partnership would provide help in “operationalizing sustainability.” Such rhetoric sounds abstract, but the Nature Conservancy has given Dow some very practical advice. The ground ozone level in the region exceeds the legal limit, and the Nature Conservancy calculated that, for what it would cost Dow to furnish the Freeport facility with an additional smokestack scrubber, it could reduce smog by planting a thousand acres of trees: green ash, hackberry, water hickory, Texas cedar elm. In addition to absorbing the <mark>pollution</mark>, the trees would suck up <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide—the primary cause of <mark>climate change</mark>—while beautifying the landscape and providing wildlife with food and sanctuary. Moreover, a mechanical scrubber needs to be replaced every two decades, but a forest is self-regenerating. “The idea to look at trees—it would never have crossed our minds,” the Dow manager told Tercek.</P><P>Standard projections anticipate that by 2100 the local sea level will have risen nearly four feet. The Nature Conservancy proposed that Dow confront this challenge by restoring marshlands. It turned out that the marshes weren’t intact enough to make much difference—the Nature Conservancy scientist in charge of the project called them “patchy, a mix of grass and open area”—but the strategy impressed Dow executives, who are considering using it at other coastal facilities. “It was very positive, very successful,” the Dow scientist who headed the program told me. Tercek clearly knew how to win over the people at Dow. At one point, he told them, “The old model would be ‘We’re doing it for conservation’s sake.’ The new approach would be ‘No, no, we’re doing this for <EM>business’</EM> sake, and we get the conservation, too.’ ”</P></DIV><DIV class=""SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7""><P>“I’m a humble guy,” Tercek likes to say. He was born in Cleveland, the third of six children. His father was an insurance salesman and the leader of a local polka band. Mark got a scholarship to Western Reserve Academy, a prep school in Hudson, Ohio, where he ran track, played center on the football team, and helped edit the school paper. His high-school friend Mitch Nauffts told me that Tercek “was then, as he is now, this can-do, glass-always-at-least-half-full kind of person, willing to do the hard things and not procrastinate about them.”</P><P>Tercek attended Williams College, where he published poetry and wrote a “mini-thesis” on the modernist novel, then moved to Japan to teach English. But he was restless, he remembers. In 1980, he took a job at Bank of America in Tokyo. “I kind of snapped out of my stupid college reverie,” he said. “My image of a businessperson was, you know . . . you’re actually <EM>doing</EM> something, putting these deals together.” He went to Harvard Business School and, in 1984, he received offers from Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs. He chose Goldman because its employees seemed “most like me—team-oriented, with backgrounds that were not fancy ones.”</P><P>In 1986, at the age of twenty-nine, Tercek was made a partner. When the firm went public, three years later, his share was thirty million dollars. He was living with his family in a large house in Irvington, a Westchester suburb, and he bought a vacation home in Nantucket. But success didn’t narrow Tercek’s interests the way it does for some people. He became a vegetarian and started practicing yoga; for a while, he taught classes at Yoga Zone, in Irvington and Manhattan. Tercek, who votes for moderate Democrats, never planned to spend his life at Goldman. And by the mid-aughts the firm was shifting from investment banking to trading, which didn’t engage him.</P><DIV class=""Callout__inset-left___2rZjf"" data-type=""callout"" data-callout=""inset-left""><DIV class=""CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM ""><A class=""Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW "" href=""https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a18196""><FIGURE class=""Figure__figure___U_9Te  ""><FIGCAPTION class=""ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5""><SPAN class=""ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO"">“Are you planning on just looking at that book or are you gonna borrow it?”</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></A></DIV></DIV><P>At this point, Tercek and his wife, Amy—a former photo editor at <EM>Spy</EM>—had four children, and they started taking a lot of nature vacations. “Low-budget trips booked by Thomson Family Adventures,” he remembers. “Belize, Costa Rica, the Galápagos, some place in Pennsylvania.” They made so many trips that the travel agency put the family’s picture on a brochure. When he journeyed to rain forests, Tercek took note of logging and deforestation, and began to wonder whether the same capitalistic forces that were damaging nature might be turned around to protect it.</P><P>When Tercek told Henry Paulson, the head of Goldman, that he was contemplating leaving the firm, Paulson offered him the job of running the bank’s sustainability and environmental unit. Paulson had created the group to help the firm operate by green principles. It was also supposed to educate Goldman in avoiding environmentally unsound deals. There were business opportunities in conservation as well. The right to pollute was becoming a marketable commodity, through proposals like cap-and-trade, which would permit companies to emit a fixed amount of <mark>pollution</mark> and trade with others for their allotments. Goldman owned part of the Chicago <mark>Climate</mark> Exchange, which handled transactions involving <mark>pollution</mark> credits. The division was fuelled by “enlightened self-interest,” Tercek recalls. “Hank is a tough-minded businessperson.”</P><P>Tercek took the job, and promoted Goldman’s initiatives to environmental leaders across the country. In 2007, a group of private-equity firms bought the power utility T.X.U. and, in return for support from environmental organizations, reduced the number of coal-fired plants that it was planning to build. “I came up with the idea of going from eleven to three,” Tercek says. Goldman was both an investor and the investment banker for the private-equity groups. The deal was controversial and remains so. Many green activists felt that the environmentalists who offered support for the deal had been snookered, and argued that continued popular pressure could have eliminated the coal-fired plants. One environmental leader told the <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM> that the conservation groups supporting the T.X.U. deal “should be hung for what they’ve done.” Tercek’s response is “Should there have been no coal-fired plants? Well, fine, but then no one will have electricity.”</P><P>When Tercek was offered the top job at the Nature Conservancy, in 2008, he took a salary cut of roughly ninety per cent. (He makes nearly seven hundred thousand dollars a year, but since he started the job he has pledged to donate more than twice that amount to the Conservancy.) He wanted to manage a large organization and was eager to try out some of his ideas. The Nature Conservancy’s announcement of Tercek’s hire emphasized his skills at finding “innovative possibilities for aligning economic forces with conservation.” The transition was not seamless. At his first company-wide video conference, Tercek could be seen drinking from a plastic water bottle; the next day, one staffer after another gave him Nalgene bottles. Tercek had been known as a good listener at Goldman, but people at the Nature Conservancy began complaining that he didn’t listen well enough. He felt that he was “kind of struggling,” and found a C.E.O. coach to help. Nevertheless, he sees it as a strength that he’s in the arena, not in the woods. He recalls, “When I first got here, some people seemed to challenge me on this and say, ‘How can you be an environmentalist if you didn’t grow up fly-fishing and horseback riding?’ And I’d say, ‘Look. You don’t have an exclusive on this.’ ” He adds, “There’s an inner environmentalist in everyone.”</P><P>That fall, the Nature Conservancy, which relies heavily on donations, was hit hard by the financial meltdown, and had to cut its staff by ten per cent. It was fortunate that an experienced manager was in charge; the Nature Conservancy weathered the crisis well and was soon back at full strength. Tercek remembers the crash as “a good exercise,” albeit stressful. But what had the Nature Conservancy rebounded to do? From its inception, in 1951, the organization had focussed on buying parcels of land to preserve them from development. “Saving the Last Great Places on Earth” has long been one of its slogans. Over the years, it placed under protection land that, in aggregate, was roughly twenty-two times the size of Massachusetts. The goal was to wall off as many animals and plants as possible, to preserve biodiversity and ecological hot spots in the face of development. Tercek had two strong misgivings about the Nature Conservancy’s work. First, its budget was insufficient for its ambitions. “We’re, like, the masters of philanthropy,” he says. “We’ve raised more money than anyone, but I can tell you it’s not enough money.” And, second, if nature was a market share, environmentalists were losing it. The globe was warming, the ice caps melting. If you saved a great place or two every year, you weren’t affecting the larger dynamic of destruction. If <mark>climate change</mark> wasn’t checked, even land that had been walled off by environmentalists might lose much of its biodiversity.</P><P>The answer, for Tercek, was to unleash what had made him and his colleagues rich at Goldman: the power of the markets. A preference for financial thinking runs like an underground stream through Tercek’s conversation; he feels that accurate numbers can cut through illogical rhetoric and pinpoint the quickest path to a goal. He is a proponent of “impact investments,” in which money is given to a socially beneficial enterprise with a prospect of financial return. “The problem with donors is you hate to ever disappoint them, so you paper over your mistakes and pretend things didn’t go badly,” he explained. “You paper them over so well even you don’t realize it. With an investor mind-set, there won’t be room for that.” And he recalls with irritation the standard visit that he makes to foundations on behalf of the Nature Conservancy: “They always give you these lectures on accountability, but then they don’t hold you accountable. I say, ‘Ask me some questions!’ ” (In late April, Tercek announced a major project, financed by J. P. Morgan, to simplify impact investing. The bank declared that its goal was to “step up the scale and creativity of financial resources dedicated to the protection of natural ecosystems.”)</P><DIV class=""Callout__inset-left___2rZjf"" data-type=""callout"" data-callout=""inset-left""><DIV class=""CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM ""><A class=""Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW "" href=""https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a18216""><FIGURE class=""Figure__figure___U_9Te  ""><FIGCAPTION class=""ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5""><SPAN class=""ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO"">“I hope you remembered to bring something for the dog.”</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></A></DIV></DIV><P>Tercek thinks that the nonprofit mind-set can be too timid. When he heard another Nature Conservancy slogan, “Quietly Conserving Nature,” he asked himself, “Why not save nature <EM>loudly</EM>?” In February, I sat in on an executive-team meeting, and when <mark>climate change</mark> came up Tercek asked why Conservancy scientists didn’t express the anticipated temperature increase in Fahrenheit instead of centigrade. “It would be a lot scarier,” he pointed out. In general, he finds the organization’s reluctance to take the lead on <mark>climate change</mark> a frustration, as if he were missing out on the I.P.O. of a lifetime.</P><P>In one way, Tercek and the Nature Conservancy are a natural match. The organization has never aspired to be as confrontational as Greenpeace, and has accepted donations from companies that are far from pure. Patrick Noonan, the C.E.O. of the Nature Conservancy in the seventies, once responded to a reporter’s suggestion that corporate money had a taint by replying, “It may be tainted, but ’tain’t enough!” The idea that nature should be viewed as a market had intellectual antecedents, too, going back almost as far as the competing idea of nature as priceless. In the nineties, the prestige of market-based solutions rose in tandem with the stock market. In 1997, a widely read paper published in <EM>Nature</EM> put the value of the annual output of nature at thirty-three trillion dollars; human-created value, by contrast, was worth only eighteen trillion. The paper also asserted that nature was an ideal business partner for humanity: a coral reef did the work of nurturing fish more economically than a fish farm did, and it was pretty to look at, too. “Biosphere I (the Earth) is a very efficient, least-cost provider of human life-support services,” the paper concluded.</P><P>Tercek found an ally on the Nature Conservancy staff in Peter Kareiva, its chief scientist. Kareiva, then in his mid-fifties, had long been writing the way Tercek was thinking. After receiving conventional training as an ecologist, Kareiva had two experiences that made him question orthodoxy. The first was when he was studying the arrival of exotic ladybugs in the Mt. St. Helens area. He was surprised to find that this invasion had not harmed local beetle populations: the new beetles had found a place for themselves without displacing the native ones. “It in fact had <EM>increased</EM> biodiversity,” he recalls. “That’s not the normal narrative.”</P><P>Then, in 1991, Kareiva gave testimony at a federal hearing about efforts to preserve the habitat of the spotted owl in Washington State. He looked out at loggers sitting with their children in the back row of the courtroom and thought, “Their needs have value, too.” He extended his observation to include other people outside the traditional conservation movement and concluded that the battle for nature was being fought on the wrong terrain and in the wrong language. If you saw nature as having unlimited and unquantifiable rights and humans as having none, you turned environmentalism into a form of class warfare. And a movement that ignored the needs of loggers and their children would fail, because it would never have enough supporters to protect nature on a scale that would actually matter.</P><P>The idea of wildlife as a sacred and self-evident good was under pressure on other fronts. Stories by paleo-ecologists and archeologists began revealing how extensively humans have reworked the landscape over the past several thousand years. Postcolonial-studies scholars recast the conservation movement as part of a coercive ideology foisted on the developing world. Critics even questioned the logic of a seminal 1985 essay by the American ecologist Michael Soulé, “What Is Conservation Biology?,” which asserted that “species have value in themselves, a value neither conferred nor revocable, but springing from a species’ long evolutionary heritage and potential or even from the mere fact of its existence.” Kareiva asked if there really was a scientific basis for this pronouncement. Where were the data to support the belief that maintaining biodiversity was crucial to ecological well-being? And how did you weigh Soulé’s insistence on the inviolability of nature against, say, the rights of children dying from hunger in Africa? In 2010, Kareiva published a textbook, “Conservation Science,” whose cover featured a photograph of a peasant walking through a rice field.</P><P>New conservation science, or eco-pragmatism, as this set of principles and concerns was coming to be called, had been gathering strength for some time, and various environmental organizations had adopted some of its ideas. But such efforts were scattered, and the biggest force in the field, the Nature Conservancy, had not put much of its weight behind them. Within a few months of Tercek’s arrival, he and Kareiva were e-mailing constantly, and he had promoted Kareiva, adding him to his executive team. “Peter reminds me of the Wall Street approach,” Tercek told me. Kareiva, in turn, appreciated his boss’s insistence on data: “Someone would tell a story—there are a lot of conservation stories and environmental stories—and that wouldn’t satisfy Mark, and it wouldn’t satisfy me, either.” Tercek, who had moved to Washington, held a party at his Georgetown home to introduce Kareiva’s book to the city’s science-policy leaders.</P><P>Bolstered by Tercek’s support, Kareiva promoted his views by giving talks, writing blog posts, and publishing magazine articles. The new science of conservation would be data-based, corporate-friendly, and anti-élitist. It would not fetishize biodiversity. It accepted a world more like, say, the Meadowlands, in New Jersey—where MetLife Stadium shares space with twenty thousand acres of wetlands—than Yellowstone National Park. In “Conservation in the Anthropocene,” an article published in February, 2012, Kareiva and two co-authors, Michelle Marvier and Robert Lalasz, wrote, “By its own measure, conservation is failing. Biodiversity on Earth continues its rapid decline.” They went on:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Conservation cannot promise a return to pristine, prehuman landscapes. Humankind has already profoundly transformed the planet and will continue to do so. What conservation could promise instead is a new vision of a planet in which nature . . . exists amid a wide variety of modern, human landscapes. For this to happen, conservationists will have to jettison their idealized notions of nature, parks and wilderness—ideas that have never been supported by good conservation science—and forge a more optimistic, human-friendly vision.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><DIV class=""Callout__inset-left___2rZjf"" data-type=""callout"" data-callout=""inset-left""><DIV class=""CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM ""><A class=""Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW "" href=""https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a18089""><FIGURE class=""Figure__figure___U_9Te  ""><FIGCAPTION class=""ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5""><SPAN class=""ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO"">“We’re the adorable cookie suppliers around here.”</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></A></DIV></DIV><P>Nature, the authors argued, would survive, in one form or another. Not every species was irreplaceable: the extinction of dodos and passenger pigeons had caused no more damage, from a scientific point of view, than had the arrival of exotic ladybugs on Mt. St. Helens. Even the polar bear, “that classic symbol of fragility,” might well survive global warming, because, as the Arctic ice melted, the seals that are its food source would also move north; they’d crowd together in a smaller but still viable habitat. If worse came to worst, global warming would reunite the polar bear’s gene pool with that of the brown bear, from which it had evolved two hundred thousand years ago, during a period of global cooling. The conclusion of Kareiva and his co-authors was sanguine: “As we destroy habitats, we create new ones.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7""><P>One day last summer, five old-school conservation biologists—among them Michael Soulé and E. O. Wilson—sent a letter of complaint to Tercek. They were tired of hearing about their obsolescence. For too long, Kareiva had been accusing them of poor science and irrational alarmism. In the letter, they denounced his ideas as “wrongheaded, counterproductive, and ethically dubious,” and added, “It is hard to believe that they are coming from the chief scientist of The Nature Conservancy, an organization formerly, and heroically, dedicated to conserving <EM>nature,</EM> not merely <EM>natural resources</EM> for people.”</P><P>From other quarters, Kareiva had received support for his critique. A group of young businessmen invited him to a weekend retreat to discuss the “Anthropocene” article and raised twenty-eight thousand dollars for the Nature Conservancy. Many people working on sustainability issues in the N.G.O. world felt that the Nature Conservancy had finally woken up from a fantasy. The head of an international organization that focusses on global food issues told Tercek recently, “You’ve gone from buying hectares and putting fences around it to realizing there are people in there.”</P><P>But when Kareiva’s co-author Michelle Marvier, an ecologist at Santa Clara University, gave a talk at San Francisco State University, shortly after the “Anthropocene” article appeared, an audience member approached her, weeping. The hashtag #OccupyTNC appeared on Twitter and powerful Conservancy backers tried to get Kareiva fired. In the summer of 2012, at a Society for Conservation Biology meeting in Oakland, Marvier gave a talk about the hardiness of ecosystems; afterward, Soulé stood up and said, “Your resilience argument is so misleading that it boggles the mind.” At an Aspen Institute conference on the environment, Wilson clashed with another new conservationist, Emma Marris. When she suggested that environmentalists accept some nonnative species as a legitimate part of the ecosystem, he said, “Where do you plant that white flag you’re carrying?”</P><P>That October, thirty-five traditional conservationists and their funders gathered at a hotel in Denver. The Weeden Foundation, a small environmental nonprofit, helped pay for the meeting, which focussed on generating a coördinated response to the new conservation. Among other things, the participants decided to write the letter of complaint to Tercek; to begin work on an essay collection, “Keeping the Wild: Against the Domestication of Earth,” which has just been published; and to take their case to the Nature Conservancy’s funders.</P><P>Taking on the Nature Conservancy was a daring act. Many conservation biologists have drawn funding from the organization or worked with it. (The Weeden Foundation helps pay for a Conservancy project in Chile.) But when several big Nature Conservancy supporters contacted Tercek to express dismay over its new ethos, he knew that he had to do something. Soon after receiving the letter, he invited his antagonists to a meeting at his office. A small group came in the fall, among them Soulé; Don Weeden, the head of his family foundation; Stuart Pimm, of Duke University; and Reed Noss, of the University of Central Florida. A former Conservancy scientist told me that it was the “Come-to-Jesus meeting.” Wilson, who is eighty-four, had wanted to attend but is in poor health, and Bruce Babbitt, the former Secretary of the Interior, cancelled at the last minute. “I think he decided he didn’t want to get involved,” Tercek told me.</P><P>The meeting took place on October 21st, at the Nature Conservancy’s headquarters, in Arlington, Virginia. An eight-story building constructed in the late nineteen-nineties, it has sage-green-and-tumbleweed-yellow carpet that evokes the savanna, and there is a <mark>sustainable</mark> garden in the courtyard. But the offices could easily be those of a trade group, and a plaque in the lobby thanks “generous” corporate friends, among them Dow, DuPont, and Georgia-Pacific.</P><P>The summit meeting started at 9 <EM class=""small"">A.M</EM>. Tercek had on a suit. Kareiva looked rumpled in an academic way. Soulé and Noss, both lean, with trim beards, had the self-contained manner of people who had spent a lot of time in isolated places; Soulé wore fleece.</P><P>A few weeks before the meeting, Soulé had published an opinion piece, in <EM>Conservation Biology,</EM> in which he declared that it was time to stop calling classical environmentalism a “dysfunctional, antihuman anachronism.” He went on, “Conservationists and citizens alike ought to be alarmed by a scheme that replaces wild places and national parks with domesticated landscapes containing only nonthreatening, convenient plants and animals.”</P><P>Tercek and Kareiva had agreed in private, as Kareiva put it, that “making fun” of opponents would be “a mistake,” and that “the important thing is not to misbehave.” So Tercek—Kareiva silently by his side—began by apologizing for the tone of his chief scientist’s publications, and by acknowledging that he was the odd man out in the room. “I haven’t spent as long in the field as you,” he said. His instinct is always to find common ground—that’s how you do a deal—but when he offered the platitude “We’re winning a lot of battles and losing the war” some of the conservation biologists bristled.</P><P>“You are simply repeating what Peter is saying,” Pimm said. “What, exactly, are we <EM>failing</EM> at?” He noted that nearly fifteen per cent of the land on earth had been preserved for conservation. “We’ve reduced species extinction rates by three-quarters,” he added.</P><P>The conservationists wanted to know why they were the targets of so many attacks and why, as Soulé said, he kept hearing that “biodiversity is shit.” He went on, “You’re demeaning national parks and protected areas. Those are the things that bother me. And you’re doing a lot of damage to the conservation movement.” He called for a renewed focus on species-and-land preservation.</P><DIV class=""Callout__inset-left___2rZjf"" data-type=""callout"" data-callout=""inset-left""><DIV class=""CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM ""><A class=""Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW "" href=""https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/katz-2010-04-12""><FIGURE class=""Figure__figure___U_9Te  ""><FIGCAPTION class=""ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5""><SPAN class=""ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO"">“Come on in, kids.

The program was paid for with fees assessed from companies extracting natural gas in Alabama.</P><P>The biologists weren’t impressed by this win-win. They smelled the implication of their own unpopularity. Weeden pointed out that nearly all charitable donations in America were “purely humanitarian”; barely two per cent went toward protecting biodiversity. Why take this away?</P><P>Pimm said that it had been wrong to bash other environmentalists, adding, “You don’t have to queer our pitch.”</P><P>“We don’t do that anymore,” Tercek interrupted. In his view, he had already reined Kareiva in.</P><P>“It’s still out there,” Soulé responded.</P><P>Kareiva then admitted that “Conservation in the Anthropocene” had been a mistake. Tercek, trying to be light-hearted, pointed out that the entire dispute appeared to center on an article that was almost two years old.</P><P>“Not enough has changed,” Noss said.</P><P>Tercek, growing impatient, complained of the counterattacks: “They are hurting T.N.C.—hurting Peter, hurting me a little bit. If that’s your goal, so be it.”</P><P>Soulé said, “We might have no power compared to you, but we can have an influence on your fund-raising.”</P><P>Noss warned Tercek that his own scientists were seething over the sort of apologetic conservation they were being made to practice. Tercek dismissed the point, though outside the meeting he told me, “Are some people unhappy? Hell, yes, because we’re changing T.N.C. dramatically.”</P><P>The spat continued. The biologists wanted less corporate influence, more protected places. Pimm complained that the Nature Conservancy’s new chief political strategist was a former Bush Administration official. Soulé added that the organization’s board was seen among scientists as too full of “Wall Street and corporate people, and you’re an example.”</P><P>Tercek, his mouth tightening, said, “We get that.” But he was sorry if feelings had been hurt, and Kareiva pleaded for a focus on “outcomes, not strategies.” Weren’t they all working toward the same goal?</P><P>Soulé quoted C. P. Snow, coolly: “The problem with getting on a moral escalator is it is hard to get off.”</P><P>The gathering began breaking up. “I don’t like conflict, believe it or not,” Soulé said, promising to “stop lobbing mortars.”</P><P>An entente was reached: Kareiva would write only in peer-reviewed publications; Soulé would return to his book on human wickedness and its impact on nature; Noss would focus on the effects of rising sea levels; Pimm would study South American birds. All appeared to part friends, but later that day Noss sent me an e-mail promising that his cohort would continue opposing the Nature Conservancy’s “schizophrenic anti-biodiversity, anti-protected-areas rhetoric.”</P><P>Soon, it was as if the meeting had never taken place. Last month, Soulé and two other scientists published a letter to the editor of <EM>Animal Conservation.</EM> It is titled “ ‘New Conservation’ or Surrender to Development?” and cites Kareiva twelve times.</P></DIV><DIV class=""SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7""><P>The Nature Conservancy, which has an annual budget of nearly six hundred million dollars, is not a nimble organization. It consists of fifty state boards, with thirteen hundred trustees. Since they raise most of the money, they have most of the power, and they still focus heavily on saving land from development. Tercek, who often speaks of “big-tent environmentalism,” praises the states’ work, pointing out that the Nature Conservancy still sequesters more land “than anyone.” Since he became chairman, he is quick to observe, the Nature Conservancy has protected another twenty-five million acres. His innovative work, he emphasizes, “is ‘in addition to.’ . . . The beauty of the new stuff is it doesn’t take very much money.”</P><P>Colombia is a good place to see the new stuff, and in December I joined Tercek on a visit there. The country is poised for growth and international investment: terrorism is receding, the drug war has largely been pushed to Mexico, and the <EM class=""small"">FARC</EM>, the main insurgent group, is in peace negotiations with the government. Colombia is now projected to grow 4.7 per cent annually.</P><P>Nature can be helped by our careful stewardship, but it does even better when we leave it alone. During our visit, a Colombian Nature Conservancy naturalist drove me around the Valle del Cauca region and talked about what he had seen in previous years in the mountains to the south. “The <EM class=""small"">FARC</EM> came there, the people disappeared, and the animals returned,” he mused. Until recently, it had been dangerous to travel the roads we were on, which traversed the most fertile valley in the country. The war had been good news for the region’s many frog and butterfly species.</P><P>Colombia’s new factories will need energy and water, and new homes will require power for lights and televisions. Tercek had come to Colombia, at the government’s invitation, because the state is looking for ways to generate that power. It has principally turned its attention toward what new conservationists would call an “undervalued natural asset”—its waterways. Two powerful rivers, the Río Cauca and the Río Magdalena, start in southern Colombia, join to form a vast floodplain, and meander into the Caribbean. In the era before highways, they offered the main route through the country; my driving companion remembered his grandfather telling of floating down the river all the way to a new job in Barranquilla, on the coast.</P><P>Dams are responsible for sixteen per cent of the world’s electricity. “Environmentalists generally hate dams, even though they’re clean energy,” Tercek told me. But dams have serious ecological consequences. More than half the world’s rivers are artificially interrupted, and this fragmentation causes huge die-offs of fish and changes local ecosystems. Dams remake coastlines and cause sedimentation in the wrong places; drowned vegetation releases a lot of methane.</P><DIV class=""Callout__inset-left___2rZjf"" data-type=""callout"" data-callout=""inset-left""><DIV class=""CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM ""><A class=""Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW "" href=""https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/koren-2010-04-12""><FIGURE class=""Figure__figure___U_9Te  ""><FIGCAPTION class=""ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5""><SPAN class=""ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO"">“I’m only a few miles from home.

He does not oppose genetically modified food, nuclear power, or fracking, hoping only to play a role in easing their environmental impacts. Colombia has proposed to build seventeen new dams, and has begun a major one at Ituango, which is on the main stem of the Río Cauca. The country has a significant history of environmental activism; roughly ten per cent of its territory is national parkland. For some local environmental organizations, the eventuality of a blockaded river system is unacceptable. They see a missed opportunity: according to a 2010 World Bank report, Colombia’s wind-power availability is “among the best in South America,” and the country has great potential for both biomass and solar energy. There have been protests at an unfinished dam at Sosomango, where fishermen and local farmers feel that their livelihoods are threatened. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has called for an investigation into the recent murder of a leader of Movimiento Ríos Vivos Antioquia, which opposes the construction of the Ituango dam.</P><P>Nevertheless, the Nature Conservancy has agreed to consult on the dams. Tercek found the decision easy: the dams are likely to be built no matter what, and even wind and solar power have drawbacks. “We work in a gray place,” Tercek says. “You have to accept some ambiguity.” Although this all sounds reasonable, it can seem strange that the Nature Conservancy is supporting a very large intervention in a delicate water system, especially given that, in the States, it is celebrated for its efforts to remove dams. Colombia ranks second in the world in biodiversity, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and classical biodiversity biologists do not support more dams. In October, 2013, Michael Soulé warned against them in <EM>Conservation Biology,</EM> noting that “the globalization of intensive economic activity has accelerated the frenzied rush for energy and raw materials and is devouring the last remnants of the wild, largely to serve the expanding, affluent, consumer classes in industrialized and developing nations.”</P><P>No ground had been broken on many of the proposed dams, but Tercek and his colleagues were getting involved already, because they knew from experience that if they waited to be consulted it might be too late. They wanted to offer advice on how and where to build, so that the dams would disrupt as little as possible. Tercek came to Bogotá the day after he attended a benefit dinner in Miami. He immediately met with technocrats who are involved in making decisions about Colombia’s waterways. He noticed that the ministry dedicated to the environment was also the ministry for economic development, and drew a didactic point from it: “Fine, you can be on your biodiversity kick,” he told me. “But good luck getting the attention of the decision-makers in Colombia.” He next sat down with the official administering Colombia’s multimillion-dollar <mark>climate</mark>-adaptation fund, for which the Nature Conservancy consults. The fund will resettle populations, restore wetlands, and make other decisions that affect both livelihoods and nature. The visit confirmed Tercek’s belief in the importance of good data. “We better really accelerate our science, because these are big bets we are making,” he said. “People’s lives are at stake. We better be right.”</P><P>The next day, Tercek, in khakis and a golf cap, toured several projects in the countryside, accompanied by the Nature Conservancy’s Colombian staff. They looked not at large swaths of undeveloped land but at human-occupied property that had been misused in the past. First, they went to see El Hatico, a cattle ranch near Cali, that is pioneering <mark>sustainable</mark> husbandry in the midst of vast sugarcane fields. The owners’ <mark>innovation</mark> was simple: by planting trees and grasses, they helped the land stay cooler, which meant that the cattle needed less water. One member of Tercek’s entourage pointed out that this “three-thousand-year-old knowledge” had been forgotten. As Tercek walked along, the well-fed cattle eyed him, content in what looked like overgrown prairie rather than denuded pasture. They stretched their muzzles upward, like giraffes, to eat from bushes and trees. Coconut leaves had been laid on the ground, concave side up, to capture moisture. Tercek was impressed. “Does this really work?” he asked the owners, whose ancestors started the ranch in the eighteenth century. He stood under a huge ceiba tree. “See how comfortable this is?” the clan’s grandfather told Tercek. “Cattle like this, too.”</P><P>On a tiled veranda, one of the ranchers, Carlos Hernando Molina, launched a slide presentation on his laptop showing how ecologically friendly El Hatico had become. Even though the cattle ranch was in a dry semitropical zone, it no longer had to pipe in water. Tercek perked up when he heard that profits had increased under the new regimen, and was thrilled to learn that the surrounding sugarcane growers were beginning to follow the ranch’s example of using cut-down stalks to fertilize the land instead of burning them. Tercek asked how the project could be “scaled up.” El Hatico occupies around twenty acres; the sugarcane growers tend half a million. He held out the possibility of impact-investment money and emerged excited. “They were hardly trendy people who go to <EM class=""small"">TED</EM> conferences,” he told me afterward. “The old grandfather seemed immensely proud.”</P><P>Next, we drove about ten miles into the foothills of the Central Cordillera, to an area called El Bolo, where some of the water used by the sugarcane growers originates. The issue was how to capture more storm runoff for farming. Wooded upland areas retain rainwater longer and release it more slowly, lessening the need for pumped-in water downstream. For the past three years, the sugar growers contributed to a water fund that paid hilltop farmers to return parts of their land to forest. The water came downhill more gradually, and the sugarcane planters now had lower water costs. Tercek admired this virtuous circle, and he wanted to expand it. Over lunch at a local restaurant, he suggested that the water fund might borrow against future revenues to scale up the planting more quickly. “That’s a classic ‘me’ intervention,” he said. But it turned out that the growers’ contributions were voluntary and impossible to securitize.</P><P>We next went to a small river where, along an embankment wall, an oversized gauge measured how much water and sediment levels had changed since upstream farmers began their planting program. Tercek, excited to see hard data being collected in the field, asked a staffer to take a photograph.</P></DIV><DIV class=""SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7""><P>The standard history of the Nature Conservancy, published in 2005, is titled “Nature’s Keepers.” Last year, Tercek published a book called “Nature’s Fortune.” Clearly aimed at business executives, it asserts, “Every farmer knows you should not eat your seed corn, and every banker knows you should not spend your principal. Yet that is exactly what we are doing. . . . Natural capital is not inexhaustible.”</P><DIV class=""Callout__inset-left___2rZjf"" data-type=""callout"" data-callout=""inset-left""><DIV class=""CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM ""><A class=""Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW "" href=""https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/warp-2004-11-08""><FIGURE class=""Figure__figure___U_9Te  ""><FIGCAPTION class=""ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5""><SPAN class=""ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO"">“I found a porno movie in your drawer. I guess that means you’re curious about sex.”</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></A></DIV></DIV><P>When the Nature Conservancy collaborates with corporations, its reports assess the economic impact of the project, the environmental impact, and the effect on the common good. If Dow saves money by planting a thousand acres of trees and buying fewer smokestack scrubbers, there’s a benefit to Dow, to the local birds, and to Dow’s human neighbors. There is an obvious limitation to this approach: business logic often doesn’t line up with green logic. In Freeport, planting trees turned out to be a viable alternative to modifying smokestacks. But what if it hadn’t? When I asked Tercek about this, he said, “I don’t think you can persuade me that learning things can ever be bad.” He sounded like the well-intentioned Walter Berglund in Jonathan Franzen’s “Freedom,” an activist who leaves the Nature Conservancy for a more agile and less scrupulous group that is willing to use the money from surface-mining rights to fund bird sanctuaries.</P><P>Tercek’s optimistic salesmanship—“Investing in nature is a great deal” is one of many slogans in his book—and his reluctance to challenge people baffles many environmentalists. Being a conservationist is different from being, say, a chemist. “It is <EM>emotional</EM>,” the seventy-seven-year-old Soulé told me. “At my age and stage, I don’t mind admitting I’ve just always been in love with wild nature.” Michael Sandel, the Harvard political philosopher, has pointed out that when you put a price on something you change your relationship to it. Mostly, you weaken the bond, making it contingent, even dispensable, if the terms are good enough. Although the new conservationism claims that it can expand the pool of environmentalists, it’s hard to imagine thousands marching in the name of Tercek’s apps.</P><P>Henry Paulson pointed out to me that many companies are ahead of the government in their environmental thinking. Dow accepts <mark>climate change</mark> as a fact, whereas almost half the Texas congressional delegation does not. Yet there’s something dubious about trusting the main forces behind ecological ruin to reverse it. Dow and Coca-Cola and Rio Tinto, to name three Nature Conservancy partners, are motivated not by public spirit but by a survival instinct. If business goals overlap with ecological impulses, so much the better, but if they don’t, most companies will continue on a polluting path. This leaves little room for conservationists to operate. Recently, Tercek wrote an editorial on <mark>climate change</mark> for the Conservancy’s magazine. He considered it “pretty banal, hardly radical,” but some of his red-state trustees were unhappy and requested a meeting. “My guess is some of the trustees will be so uncomfortable they’ll leave,” Tercek said.</P><P>Business may be more efficient than government, but it is less suited to upholding principles. Dow may be now working happily with the Nature Conservancy—and I did not doubt that the employees I met wanted to make it a greener corporation—but it’s still doing harm to nature. According to the most recent E.P.A. data, Dow’s Freeport plant remains the ninth-highest emitter of bromine, the eighth-highest emitter of chlorine, the fifth-highest of cumene, and the sixth-highest of hexachloroethane, which causes cancer in mice.</P></DIV><DIV class=""SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7""><P>While I was in Colombia, I realized that I had never really looked at a dam. A small one, built in the nineteen-sixties, sits at a strategic point on the Río Calima, about an hour away from Cali. In 2011, <EM class=""small"">FARC</EM> guerrillas killed a police officer there, but when I arrived at the facility a guard seemed happy to have company. A local man stood by him, his poncho draped over his left shoulder.</P><P>Dams are curious things when you see them up close; their impact on the environment is not as obvious as that of a chemical plant. Many dams are silent, and once construction is done the intruders disappear and nature seems to return. Clouds scudded just above a set of high-voltage wires, which conveyed electricity from unseen turbines to Cali and beyond. I stood on a small road atop a fifty-foot-high embankment, the structure below me largely invisible. “Become part of the countryside without leaving a trace,” a faded roadside sign commanded, in Spanish.</P><P>To my left was Lago Calima. Windsurfers were enjoying this artificial lake, and second homes were creeping up the surrounding mountains. To my right, just past a few shacks and a small athletic field, was an astonishingly lush ravine. Although it looked primeval, it was altered land: this was where the river had flowed, uninterrupted, for thousands of years. <EM>Quereme</EM> flowers, <EM>mano de osos, flores de mayo,</EM> and scrub trees cascaded down the ravine, a natural wonder that was not natural at all. ♦</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER class=""ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ""><DIV class=""ArticleContributors__bio___3XQjk""><DIV class=""ArticleContributors__contributorWrapper___1CrIJ""><UL class=""ArticleContributors__contributorBios___3_jrJ false""><LI><P class=""ArticleContributors__contributorBioText___3m1QB"">D.

Dow Olympic and Sports Solutions’ global technology and sustainability director Dr Nicoletta Piccolrovazzi is better placed than most, then, to comment on the environmental state of play across the sports business. SportsPro caught up with Piccolrovazzi on SIIS’ second day to get her reflections on the event and find out how Dow is working to make each Olympic Games more <mark>sustainable</mark> than the last.</P><P><STRONG>As an Olympic TOP sponsor, Dow had a big year in 2016, particularly as the Rio organising committee had made sustainability one of its key priorities. What kind of projects were you involved in to help them achieve a greener Games?</STRONG></P><P>Ever since COP21 in Paris, we’ve continued to work in particular on our partnership with Rio 2016, where we were the official <mark>carbon</mark> partner. The COP was preceding the Rio Games, so we were in the midst of implementing our projects. What we have done as the official <mark>carbon</mark> partner of Rio is we implemented a range of projects in different application areas: in infrastructure, in agriculture, in industrial applications, in all these projects were really in the implementation phase. What we had to do in the run-up to the Games is we wanted to evaluate the results from these projects. So we worked with our third party auditor, ERM [Environmental Resources Management], to look at the results from the programme in Brazil and across Latin America, and get the <mark>carbon</mark> predictions and the <mark>carbon</mark> forecast verified by a third party. That was the big work to finish the implementation of the project. We were very happy because prior to the Olympic Games we were able to announce that these projects were expected to generate more than two million tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions reductions. Two million was our target, and currently we’re on target to reach 2.2 million tonnes of reductions.</P><P>The key of the programme was really that it is a legacy programme. After the Games have finished, we’ve continued to monitor those projects and the results continue to be delivered. The dialogue is still very much alive in Brazil. We had started, for instance, a programme on energy efficiency in the construction value chain that engaged hundreds of people from that industry – from architects to specifiers to contractors – in different seminars, and we are going to do a follow-up seminar on that in the next couple of months.</P><P>This is really important because the IOC is really trying to look for a legacy from all Olympic Games. For us, it’s not about leaving a legacy – we never leave. In 2016 we celebrated 60 years in Brazil, and we want to continue to grow our business in Brazil and Latin America far beyond that. So it’s not about just working at this event and then leaving, it’s about how we put steps in place prior to the event that continue to yield business results and adopt better technology in the country.</P><P><STRONG>Have you already begun looking toward the legacy you can leave in Japan after the 2020 Games?</STRONG></P><P>The way we work is we have a team of some global experts and then we always do the majority of our work on the ground with local teams. I think that’s very important, that we bring an understanding of the local market environment, and in Tokyo we have both Dow people who are there and we have also a joint venture that is very much in the energy efficiency area. So we have a dedicated team, and then the rest of the Dow business which is supporting the Olympics and sports solutions programmes, coming together to help in the collaboration to make Tokyo a <mark>sustainable</mark> Olympic Games.</P><P><STRONG>Who do you see as best placed to ensure that every Olympics leaves a <mark>sustainable</mark> legacy? Is it the sponsors, the local organisers, or does it have to come from the top down as part of a wider IOC programme?</STRONG></P><P>I think everybody has a specific role to play. The IOC did great work in the past year and a half to really develop a sustainability strategy. Having that vision clarified for the host cities and for future bid cities is extremely important, because that gives specific direction and sets out a visible a strategy for the IOC themselves as well as for the Games. The partners, particularly the TOP partners, have a very special role to play, because we participate in the Olympics, Games after Games. So we can really play a critical role in the transfer of knowledge. So for instance, Dow has not only been the official chemistry company but also the official <mark>carbon</mark> partner of the Sochi and the Rio Games. We of course have some learnings from there, and we’re now bringing those learnings to Tokyo.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In 2015, the EPA proposed to revoke all use of chlorpyrifos on farms, a call that has just been rejected by the agency’s new chief Scott Pruitt.</P><P>“We need to provide regulatory certainty to the thousands of American farms that rely on chlorpyrifos, while still protecting human health and the environment,” Pruitt said in a statement. “By reversing the previous administration’s steps to ban one of the most widely used pesticides in the world, we are returning to using sound science in decision making — rather than predetermined results.” (See also: <EM><A href=""/news/trump-rolls-back-auto-emissions-standards/"">Trump Rolls Back Auto Emissions Standards</A></EM>)</P><P>Pruitt’s decision was supported by The United States Department of Agriculture, which credited chlorpyrifos as an “important pest management tool” to ensure that the nation’s food supply is abundant and affordable.</P><H2>More Good News for <mark>Dow Chemical</mark></H2><P><mark>Dow Chemical</mark>, whose <A href=""/terms/m/merger.asp"">merger</A>with DuPont has just been approved by <A href=""/terms/e/europeanunion.asp"">EU</A> regulators, was also pleased with the the EPA’s ruling.

Traditionally, an accountant would book the value at the cost of acquisition. Environmentalists might argue for the value of its natural preservation and diversity, leading the charge for philanthropic contributions to save the wetlands. Politicians might try to eliminate it in favor of a parking lot for new development or to protect a watershed for tourism, hunting and fishing, making impassioned speeches about its importance to the economy. But what if that swamp could naturally convert waste water from a nearby manufacturing site at a cost far cheaper than building and maintaining a water treatment plant? Suddenly, the interests of the accountant, the environmentalist, the politician, and the corporate engineer coalesce around the same goal: protecting the wetland.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">“It’s all about scale,” said Dr. Neil Hawkins, Corporate Vice President, EH&amp;S, and Chief Sustainability Officer, The <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> Company (Dow), as he spoke of the company’s <A href=""http://www.dow.com/en-us/science-and-sustainability/sustainability-reporting/valuing-nature"" target=""_blank"">collaboration with The Nature Conservancy</A> (TNC). “We spend three to four billion dollars every year in capital. We spend $1.6 billion dollars every year in research. How do you leverage those investments for a win-win for the company and for nature?”</P><H3 style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>Moving ‘Natural Capital’ from Theory to Practice</STRONG></H3><P style=""text-align: justify;"">In 2011, Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and CEO of Dow, and Mark Tercek, CEO of TNC, launched a courageous collaboration. Speaking from the Detroit Economic Club, Liveris and Tercek announced that one of world’s largest science and technology companies and one of the world’s largest environmental nonprofits would join forces to figure out how to value the services of nature in order to inform business decisions.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">“It’s never been a ‘photo-op’ kind of relationship,” said Hawkins. “It was always built around the notion that we were solving together one of the biggest challenges facing the planet: how to bring the business community into saving ecosystems because it makes business sense to do that.”</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">The original inspiration for this collaborative effort was the <A href=""http://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,</A> which provided a scientific appraisal of the world’s ecosystems and the services they provide. Published in 2005, the reports represented the first attempts to codify the value of nature for business, building on the pioneering work of Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins in <A href=""http://www.rmi.org/Natural++Capitalism"" target=""_blank"" class=""broken_link""><EM>Natural Capitalism.</EM></A></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Yet, to date, such efforts had been more theoretical than actionable. “It’s one thing to be around UN meetings saying, ‘Business and nature go hand in hand.’ It’s another thing to figure out how to actually operationalize at a specific site,” said Hawkins. Although Dow didn’t originate the idea of valuing nature for business, the company was committed to figuring out how to operationalize it.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Starting with the conviction that nature had significant potential value for companies that could be converted into financial terms and used to better inform business decisions, Dow went looking for collaborators. They found in Mark Tercek, and TNC, the collaborator they needed. Tercek joined TNC in 2008, after a 24-year career in finance at Goldman Sachs, bringing with him extensive business experience. A champion of natural capital—valuing nature for its own sake as well as for the services it can provide—he saw the collaboration with Dow as an opportunity to bring it to life.</P><H3 style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>Forging an Environmental Collaboration  That Is Built to Last</STRONG></H3><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Companies sometimes embrace public partnerships with nonprofit partners for the sake of appearances, or short-term brand benefit, but alliances that achieve real outcomes are forged—literally, in the pressure and heat of negotiation, dialogue, and compromise. In the beginning, the idea of valuing the services of nature was foreign to both organizations. Incorporated in 1897, Dow is a deeply conservative, traditional science and technology company, with an engineering-driven culture. The Nature Conservancy is a confederation of local organizations, with a history of philanthropic funding and environmental activism. At every level of the collaboration, there were obstacles to overcome. At the highest level, leaders worked through classic change management challenges. Yet, instead of managing change across one organization, it was two. Hawkins is quick to point out the enormous goodwill between the organizations and the commitment to the shared goal, but still, “It wasn’t twice as hard, it was more like change management, squared.”</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Former House Speaker Tip O’Neill once quipped, “All politics is local.” So, it turns out, is real environmentalism. Hawkins described the initial conversations between the parties, which began by exploring valuations of large geographic areas. “Let’s say you’re talking about the Great Lakes,” Hawkins said. “You can value that with regard to tourism, shipping, et cetera.” But for businesses to make decisions, they need a microeconomic approach, for example focusing on a specific location with a specific operation such as Ludington, Michigan, a small town on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, home to a former Dow calcium <mark>carbon</mark>ate plant that may become a conservation and recreation site in the near future. “Estimating the value of nature to Dow and to the community is very difficult,” he explained. “You have to be able to estimate the value of nature on a narrow scale that is very geographically specific.” The challenge was figuring out how to assess natural assets at the local level, in order to build that value into decisions that concerned that particular site, to ensure Dow was able to make better business decisions for nature <EM>and</EM> the company.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">At the operational level, one of the greatest initial challenges was logistical: finding availability in the schedules of people in both organizations who had the most to contribute, many of whom were already fully obligated with other responsibilities. Dow engineers and TNC biologists had to make time to learn one another’s languages, and earn trust. Doing so required relentless and attentive leadership—constant articulation, direction, enrollment, re-enrollment, encouragement, feedback, and obstacle navigation—to ensure the joint teams had the right direction and right environment for productive output.</P><H3 style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>Measuring the Value of Nature for Business</STRONG></H3><P style=""text-align: justify;"">During the initial pilots in Freeport, Texas and Santa Vitória, Brazil, local employees from both organizations demonstrated that it was possible to estimate, and then operationalize, the value of nature. That information was then used to appropriately inform business decisions. “The single biggest output from the collaboration so far is the ESII tool,” said Hawkins. Pronounced “easy” the <A href=""http://www.dow.com/en-us/science-and-sustainability/collaborations/nature-conservancy/"" target=""_blank"">Ecosystem Services Identification &amp; Inventory</A>, or ESII, Tool is designed to help companies estimate the business value from nature on and adjacent to their sites, as well as the public value from lands on-site. “It came out of an idea we had watching Texas,” Hawkins explained. “The Texas pilot was becoming very academic, and we needed to make sure we would come out of this with a tool which could be used by an engineer at a site outside of the U.S.”</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">ESII enables a trained technician to enter site characteristics via simple, multiple choice questions on a tablet device. For example, whether the ground cover is grass, forest, or shrub, or whether water is present in the area on a perpetual or seasonal basis.  The answers to these and other questions are then combined with other data sources such as map data and <mark>climate</mark> data, into an algorithm that derives the level of ecosystem service performance of a specific site. ESII focuses on eight initial ecosystem services that are most critical to site operations and the surrounding community: water storage, water quality, water provisioning, air quality, flood control, <mark>climate</mark> regulation, erosion control, and visual and noise aesthetics. Most importantly, ESII delivers output in units that site personnel can use—for example, water storage in gallons to help the site assess needs for storm-water management.  This output data can then be integrated into financial models that assess the value provided by the ecosystem—and compare it with alternatives.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">ESII has been tested at a number of sites across the United States, including in Illinois, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and West Virginia. Once the reports of the analysis and supporting cases are complete, the ESII model will be made publically available.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Dow has already generated $200 million of economic value from the Seadrift wetland, a proof of concept that gave the company the confidence to commit to deliver another $1 billion in value (as measured through net present value calculations) through projects that are good for business <EM>and</EM> good for ecosystems by 2025, as set forth in the <A href=""http://www.dow.com/en-us/science-and-sustainability/sustainability-reporting"" target=""_blank"">company’s 10-year sustainability goals.</A> By 2020, all research and development, capital, and real estate projects will be required to measure the value of ecosystem services to their bottom line.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Dow’s 2025 Sustainability Goals, the company’s third set of 10-year goals, were set in the context of the United Nations 2030 <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals, ratified by the UN General Assembly in September. The outcome of this $1 billion collaboration with TNC will make a significant contribution towards advancing SDG #15 to protect, restore, and promote the <mark>sustainable</mark> use of the environment.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">“I think people should study the economic value for the projects we’ve already done, and recognize this as a win-win project,” said Hawkins. “We’re not preserving nature through philanthropy. We’re doing it, because nature provides a better service at lower cost,” he said.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Corporations spend millions of dollars on strategic philanthropy, some of which is used to save ecosystems. Many also spend billions on capital investments, research, and development. TNC and Dow are learning together how to leverage those resources and in so doing, are demonstrating how collaboration—even among seemingly unlikely partners—can advance the Global Goals<A href=""http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/mdgoverview/post-2015-development-agenda.html"">,</A> enabling companies everywhere to value nature in a way that makes protecting precious natural environments business as usual.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><EM> </EM></P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><EM>Tune in Thursday, November 12 at <A href=""http://bit.ly/1RshWwO"" target=""_blank"">PYXERAglobal.org</A> for a discussion between leaders from The <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> Company and The Nature Conservancy on their courageous collaboration to preserve the environment.

The evaluations were compiled by federal scientists over the last four years and were expected to result in new limits on how and where the highly toxic pesticides can be used.</P><P>But lawyers representing Dow and two other makers of the organophosphates sent letters to the heads of three cabinet agencies last week, asking that the study be &quot;set aside&quot; and saying that the results are flawed.</P><P>&quot;Our government's own scientists have already documented the grave danger these chemicals pose to people and endangered species,&quot; said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the <A href=""http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/"" target=""_blank"">Center for Biological Diversity</A>. &quot;Unable to win on the facts, Dow is now adopting the same disgraceful tactics honed by the tobacco industry and the <mark>climate</mark> deniers to try to discredit science and scrap reasonable conservation measures that will protect our most endangered animals and plants.&quot;</P><P>Last month, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/tag/scott-pruitt"">Scott Pruitt</A> scrapped his own agency's <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/epa-pesticide-ban-chlorpyrifos-2338511186.html"">proposal to ban chlorpyrifos</A>—an insecticide that at small doses can harm children's brains and nervous systems—from use on food crops. The AP noted that chlorpyrifos originates from a nerve gas developed by Nazi Germany, and Dow sells about 5 million pounds of the chemical in the U.S. each year.</P><P>&quot;Public health experts, pediatricians and EPA scientists all agree that chlorpyrifos is unsafe for children at any level,&quot; <A href=""http://www.ewg.org/"" target=""_blank"">Environmental Working Group</A> Senior VP for government affairs Scott Faber said after Pruitt announcement. &quot;That overwhelming and uniform agreement among experts should have been all the information Administrator Pruitt needed to protect kids from this notorious neurotoxin. Yet, he decided instead to side with Croplife, Dow and the rest of chemical agriculture and allow chlorpyrifos to remain in use.&quot;</P><P>The government scientists found that chlorpyrifos is &quot;likely to adversely affect&quot; 1,778 of the 1,835 animals and plants in its study. Diazinon and malathion, which the World Health Organization announced as <A href=""https://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/iarcnews/pdf/MonographVolume112.pdf"" target=""_blank"">probable carcinogens</A> in 2015, were similarly found to threaten vulnerable species. </P><P>But lawyers for the Dow subsidiary that sells chlorpyrifos called for the research to be withdrawn because its &quot;scientific basis was not reliable.&quot; </P><P>Malathion maker FMC Corp. said the withdrawal of the study will allow the necessary time for the &quot;best available&quot; scientific data to be compiled. Diazinon maker Makhteshim Agan of North America Inc. did not comment.</P><P>Dow <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/funded-trumps-inauguration-2370182741.html"">donated $1 million</A> to the presidential inauguration and the company's CEO, Liveris, leads Trump's advisory council on manufacturing. In February, Liveris <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/trump-executive-order-regulations-2282814216.html"" target=""_blank"">received the signing pen</A> after the president signed the &quot;Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda,&quot; an executive order aimed at eliminating regulations that Trump claims are damaging to the U.S. economy, but some worry that the measure will roll back critical environmental protections.</P><P>Dow's director of public affairs Rachelle Schikorra told the AP that any suggestion that the company is trying to influence the new administration's regulatory decisions is &quot;completely off the mark.&quot;</P><P>&quot;Dow actively participates in policymaking and political processes, including political contributions to candidates, parties and causes, in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws,&quot; Schikorra said.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""sPost_0_4_0_0_0_1_1_0_0_0_1_0_1"" class=""post-partial article__comments""><DIV class=""article-content__comments-wrapper""><DIV class=""action-btn js-toggle js--active"" data-target=""#comments-widget"" data-toggle-class=""hidden"">Show Comments (</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

      San Francisco, CA —<P>Today, farmers, conservation groups and food and farm justice organizations stood up to protest against the contamination of rural communities, our food supply and the environment by filing a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration. The groups are suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under new administrator Scott Pruitt for approving <A href=""http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/video/2519/cfs-videos/dow-destroying-our-world/3004/dow-chemicals-mad-men"" target=""_blank"">Dow AgroScience’s Enlist Duo</A>, a mixture of the weed-killing chemicals glyphosate and 2,4-D—both of which are known to be highly toxic. The novel combo pesticide is sprayed directly on corn, soybean and cotton plants that are genetically engineered by Dow specifically to survive exposure to the pesticide. EPA approved the use of the pesticide in 34 states.</P><DIV class=""locator-map2016""><DIV class=""container-map-caption""><DIV class=""legendContainer""><DIV class=""legendCaption"">EPA approved the use of Enlist Duo in <A href=""https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/registration-enlist-duo#states"" target=""_blank"">34 states</A>.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Farmers will be hit hard by the human health harms of Enlist Duo, and are put at risk financially by 2,4-D’s known tendency to volatize, drift and damage neighboring crops. The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects  that Enlist Duo’s approval will lead to as much as a seven-fold increase in agricultural use of 2,4-D—a component of the infamous Vietnam-era defoliant “Agent Orange”, which has been linked to Parkinson’s disease, non-Hodgkins lymphoma and other reproductive problems. The other component of Enlist Duo is glyphosate, the active ingredient in Monsanto’s flagship pesticide Roundup. Glyphosate was classified as a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organization in 2015.</P><P>This is the second lawsuit the groups have had to bring over the product. After the groups <A href=""//earthjustice.org/news/press/2014/coalition-of-farmers-and-environmental-groups-to-challenge-epa-over-herbicide-approval-0"">challenged</A> its initial approval in 2014, the <A href=""//earthjustice.org/news/press/2015/epa-pulls-registration-for-dow-s-enlist-duo-herbicide-citing-high-toxicity-levels-0"">Obama Administration agreed</A> to re-analyze some of its impacts. Unfortunately, EPA then re-affirmed its original approval and dramatically expanded it, allowing Enlist Duo to be sprayed in more than twice as many states and on cotton in addition to corn and soybeans.</P><P>Enlist crops and Enlist Duo are part of a disturbing, industry-wide trend where crops are genetically engineered to withstand multiple pesticides, allowing pesticide companies like Dow and Monsanto to sell both expensive GE seeds and large quantities of the pesticide cocktails that are sprayed on them. While these GE crop systems initially provide a quick-fix way to kill weeds, the intensive spraying triggers rapid evolution of weed resistance to the chemicals. Just as overuse of antibiotics breeds resistant bugs and more antibiotics to kill them, so these GE crop systems drive a toxic spiral of increasing weed resistance and pesticide use. </P><P>In addition to health risks, significant crop damage from pesticide drift, and increases in both weed resistance and pesticide use, spraying Enlist Duo on millions of acres will contaminate waterways and important wildlife habitat. EPA’s own assessments found that Enlist Duo is highly toxic to numerous plants and animals, including endangered and threatened species found in or near agricultural fields.</P><P>The petitioners bringing the lawsuit are National Family Farm Coalition, Family Farm Defenders, Pesticide Action Network North America, Beyond Pesticides, Center for Food Safety and Center for Biological Diversity, represented jointly by legal counsel from Earthjustice and Center for Food Safety.</P><H3 class=""more-padding"">Quotes:</H3><P>&quot;Further industrialization of agriculture through Dow’s chemical solutions will lead to fewer family farmers, more <mark>pollution</mark> and more resistant weeds, but that will be okay for chemical companies like Dow with only one solution to every problem in agriculture—a sledge hammer of more chemicals and the GMOs immune to them.  Enlist Duo’s own label recognizes there may be weed biotypes already resistant to glyphosate or 2,4-D,&quot; said <STRONG>George Naylor of the National Family Farm Coalition</STRONG>, who farms non-genetically-engineered crops in Iowa.</P><P><STRONG>Jim Goodman, Family Farm Defenders board member and organic farmer</STRONG> from Wonewoc, Wisconsin, commented: &quot;Roundup was initially touted as a replacement for older, more dangerous chemicals like 2,4-D. Now that Roundup, the widely used carcinogenic pesticide is failing to kill weeds, Dow is bringing back 2,4-D and teaming them up to create a more toxic mix than ever. Will the buffer strips on my organic farm be adequate protection from the more volatile drift-prone nature of 2,4-D? I should not be put in the position to find out.&quot;</P><P>“Scott Pruitt and the Trump administration are endangering farmers and the environment by caving to Big Ag and approving this highly toxic pesticide combo,” said <STRONG>Sylvia Wu, staff attorney for Center for Food Safety </STRONG>and legal counsel in the case. “Fortunately we have laws written to protect farmers and the environment, and we intend to have the Court enforce them.”</P><P><STRONG>Earthjustice attorney Paul Achitoff </STRONG>commented: “EPA knows that spraying a hundred thousand tons of this pesticide on millions of acres every year will threaten the survival and recovery of some of our most iconic endangered species, but it refuses to follow the law that protects them. We will hold EPA accountable.”</P><P>“The lack of vision and oversight by our federal agencies is outrageous,” said <STRONG>Marcia Ishii-Eiteman, PhD, senior scientist at Pesticide Action Network North America</STRONG>. “By continuing to defer to the pesticide industry’s every wish, EPA shirks its duty to protect the health of rural communities and the livelihoods of farmers. It also locks us into a failed and obsolete model of chemical-intensive agriculture, rather than spearheading a transition to the healthy, vibrant food and farming system that Americans deserve. ”</P><P>“EPA’s registration of Enlist Duo, which causes unreasonable adverse effects to health and the environment, is responsible for increased 2,4-D use—as much as a seven-fold increase to 176 million per year by 2020, without the economic return achieved by those who practice <mark>sustainable</mark> organic production,” said <STRONG>Jay Feldman, executive director of Beyond Pesticides</STRONG>.</P><P>“In reissuing an expanded approval for this toxic chemical cocktail, the EPA has shown an utter disregard for human health, our drinking water and endangered species like the iconic whooping crane,” said <STRONG>Stephanie Parent, senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity</STRONG>. “The law requires reasonable safeguards and the EPA has left us with no choice but to force the issue in this suit.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""earthjustice-master-region earthjustice-master-region--seventh-side""><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-press-contacts flex-blue""><H2 class=""pane-title"">Contacts</H2><DIV class=""pane-content""><P><A href=""mailto:achitoff@earthjustice.org"">Paul Achitoff</A>, Earthjustice, (808) 599-2436</P><P><A href=""mailto:pr@centerforfoodsafety.org"">Courtney Sexton</A>, Center for Food Safety, (202) 547-9359</P><P><A href=""mailto:sparent@biologicaldiversity.org"">Stephanie Parent</A>, Center for Biological Diversity, (971) 717-6404</P><P><A href=""mailto:jfeldman@beyondpesticides.org"">Jay Feldman</A>, Beyond Pesticides, (202) 255-4296</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-views pane-related-cases-victories flex-blue""><DIV class=""pane-content""><DIV class=""view view-related-cases-victories view-id-related_cases_victories view-display-id-block_10 view-dom-id-eac2c7889a9dea5fa25d8c60676c44c8""><DIV class=""view-content""><DIV><DIV class=""views-field views-field-nothing""><SPAN class=""field-content"">Legal Case</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

        In pulling out of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> deal, Trump showed America is a clear and present danger to civilization itself
      </P></DIV></ARTICLE></ASIDE><P>Politicians across the nation, noting that majorities of voters in every single state (even West Virginia!) opposed withdrawing from the pact, pledged to keep up the fight. More than 300 mayors and counting have announced a compact to fight for the goals of the Paris accord, and 12 states (including New York and California and representing more than a third of the nation's economy) formed the U.S. <mark>Climate</mark> Alliance to reach the targets set in the French capital in 2015. In fact, as the director of Canada's <mark>Climate</mark> Action Network said, &quot;Trump's move to withdraw the U.S. from the accord has resulted in the clearest...call for <mark>climate</mark> action from every corner of human civilization yet.&quot;</P><P>Still, one is allowed just the teensiest bit of cynicism when it comes to CEOs and politicians. The head of <mark>Dow Chemical</mark>, for instance, had expressed his &quot;disappointment&quot; with Trump, noting in grave CEO-speak that &quot;Leaders don't leave tables. Leaders stay.&quot; It turned out, however, that Dow was a member of a key lobbying group pushing for withdrawal. In Vermont, the hypocrisy was on display the very same day. Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who called the president's decision &quot;concerning,&quot; said the state would join the <mark>Climate</mark> Alliance. And yet, the same afternoon, Scott named as the state's top utility regulator a lawyer who has spent the past few years fighting new wind and solar power. </P><P>All of which is to say, just as physics is unlikely to be intimidated by Trump's bluster, it won't pay any heed to meaningless pledges by politicians. Physics cares about how much <mark>carbon</mark> is in the atmosphere. The time for encouraging messages of support for the <mark>climate</mark> is over – we need action. This has been a problem for years; Democrats in particular have been able to slip by with simple declarations that they &quot;believe&quot; in <mark>climate</mark> science. But at this point, who cares? Certainly not the swift heating planet. We need serious and immediate commitment to action. Here are three simple criteria for determining whether your local politicians are serious enough to pass the <mark>climate</mark> test.</P><P><B> They are committed to converting to 100 percent renewable energy</B>A few years ago, this would have been a hard test, because while it was clear that we needed to drive <mark>carbon</mark> emissions to zero in order to have a chance of slowing down <mark>climate change</mark>, it wasn't clear we had enough alternative power available. Solar and wind were still expensive, and worse, they operated intermittently: When the sun wasn't shining or the wind ceased to blow, you were out of luck. But over the past decade, these technologies have gotten cheaper and more powerful. From Abu Dhabi to Chile to Mexico to India, solar power costs less to produce than any other form of energy; across much of America, wind costs the same as or less than coal-fired power. As of this year, wind and solar account for 10 percent of electricity in the U.S., and that's only a glimmer of our potential. Best of all, the sundown problem is being solved fast, as batteries are able to store the energy from the morning sun and the wind from a gusty evening to keep the power running overnight.</P><P>For years, the research teams at places like Exxon have not just been lying about global warming, they've also been insisting that change must come slowly – that by 2040 the world will still be relying almost entirely on fossil fuel. But <mark>innovation</mark> has badly outrun those predictions. At the end of May, Patrick Lee, a vice president at Sempra Energy, one of the country's biggest utilities, addressed an industry gathering: &quot;I am speaking with confidence....We have a solution now to adjust the intermittency of solar and wind energy that is no longer a technology challenge. Now it is an economic decision.&quot; Three years ago, Lee said, his engineering background made him doubt that 100 percent renewable energy was possible – the grid might always need some coal or gas-fired plants to ensure stability. &quot;But today my answer is: The technology has been resolved. How fast do you want to get to 100 percent? That can be done today.&quot;</P><P class="""">That the management at his Southern California utility reportedly made him walk back the statement two days later only underlines the point: Technological possibility now bumps up against the everlasting power of the fossil-fuel industry. Recent studies have raised questions about where the last few percentage points of that energy may come from a decade or three down the line, but those are technical quibbles: In 2017, 100 percent renewable is the test of whether a politician is serious.</P><P class="""">That's why Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley and Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced a bill in April calling for the 100 percent mark to be reached by 2050 (or, hopefully, sooner – if technological <mark>innovation</mark> continues apace). It obviously won't pass the current Congress, but on a planet where an iceberg the size of Delaware is about to calve from the Antarctic ice shelf, that number is now the minimum standard for <mark>climate</mark> credibility. In the words of the great gospel song/civil-rights anthem, &quot;99 and a half won't do.&quot; The civil-rights theme is no accident, by the way: What was once the environmental movement is now increasingly the <mark>climate</mark>-justice movement, led by communities that are choking on <mark>pollution</mark> and workers who know the next burst of good jobs will come from this renewables build-out.</P><ASIDE class=""inset-image inset-full""><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""credit"">Kayana Szymczak/The New York Times/Redux</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></ASIDE><P class=""""><B>They will work to keep remaining fossil fuels in the ground</B>Since we're committing to 100 percent renewable, there's absolutely no need for any new fossil-fuel infrastructure – no new pipelines, no new frack wells, no new coal mines like the one Trump lauded in his Paris speech. The reason is obvious: If you build them, given the payback time for investments, you're signing up for another four decades of heating the planet. This would seem an obvious test for a <mark>climate</mark>-credible politician – it's been at the heart of the anti-warming movement since at least 2011, when droves of people went off to jail to protest the Keystone XL pipeline. (Full disclosure, I was one of them.)</P><P>The movement has won some of these fights: There are bans on fracking in New York and Maryland; Shell retreated from a proposed drilling operation in Alaska after activists blocked delivery of its rigs; and half a dozen proposed coal ports along the Pacific coast are still unbuilt. Even seeming losses aren't done deals – in June, a federal court ruled that the Dakota Access pipeline hadn't gone through the proper reviews, a big win for the Standing Rock Sioux, who may yet shut the project down. </P><P>What's interesting is how hard it's been to get politicians to help. Republican opposition is easy to understand: The party is a wholly owned subsidiary of the fossil-fuel industry (every time there's a major vote in Congress, Oil Change International- helpfully publishes a list of how much each of the &quot;ayes&quot; has taken from the hydro<mark>carbon</mark> lobby). But too often, Democrats go along as well, even if they're not getting big Texas money. The week before the November election, and the month after security- guards sicced German shepherds on native protesters, Hillary Clinton released this statement about the Dakota pipeline: <I>All of the parties involved – including the federal government, the pipeline company and contractors, the state of North Dakota, and the tribes – need to find a path forward that serves the broadest public interest. </I>For those of us campaigning for her, that waffling didn't make it easy to win votes – but it was at least predictable, because she and other Democrats were under pressure from the unions that like building pipelines. </P><P class="""">It may get easier now for Democrats and progressives to take a stronger stand, because those construction unions have become some of Trump's most uncritical supporters. Two days after the Women's March filled the streets of D.C., the brass from the Building Trades Unions visited the Oval Office, where they had nothing but praise for its new occupant. &quot;We have a common bond with the president,&quot; Sean McGarvey, head of the Building Trades, said. &quot;We come from the same industry.&quot;</P><P class="""">Happily, the other three-quarters of the labor movement has increasingly sided with the communities fighting against <mark>climate change</mark>, in part because it's obvious that renewable energy will supply the jobs of the future. As Naomi Klein wrote in <I>The New York</I><I>Times</I>, &quot;Today labor leaders face a clear choice:&quot; Back bogus pipelines or &quot;join the diverse and growing movement that is confronting Mr. Trump's agenda on every front and attempt to lead America's workers to a clean and safe future.&quot;</P><P class="""">For politicians, that choice is even clearer- – and some have responded. Portland, Oregon, for instance, recently banned any new fossil-fuel infrastructure. Philadelphia has plans to become a fossil-fuel &quot;hub&quot; for the Atlantic seaboard, but a broad coalition of scientists and community groups is putting up a stiff fight. In Virginia, even though he lost the primary, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom Perriello put a scare into the party's hierarchy with an insurgent candidacy powered by his opposition to two pipelines and his refusal to be bankrolled by the state's utility giant, Dominion Energy – in fact, 61 Democratic- legislative candidates across the state joined Perriello in turning down Dominion campaign cash. </P><ASIDE class=""inset-image inset-full""><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">A protest march to a sacred burial ground at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota in September.</SPAN><SPAN class=""credit"">Alyssa Schukar/The New York Times/Redux</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></ASIDE><P><B>They understand natural gas could be the most dangerous fuel of all</B>For the past decade, the democratic get-out-of-jail-free card for dealing with <mark>climate</mark> was natural gas – but as with renewable energy, the passage of time changed the situation enormously. It seemed at first blush a victory when wildcatters began finding vast supplies of natural gas beneath America's soil in the aughts. Because natural gas produces half as much <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide as coal when you burn it in a power plant, President Obama seized on this bounty as both an environmental and economic windfall.</P><P>But two problems soon emerged. One, to get at the gas, you had to frack (that is, explode) the subsurface geology, and soon communities were reporting all kinds of environmental woes – particularly with contaminated groundwater. Second, researchers began to report that the process of producing gas was releasing so much methane (itself a powerful greenhouse gas) into the atmosphere that it was no better for the environment than burning coal. In fact, satellite data suggested that even though <mark>carbon</mark> emissions had fallen as coal-fired power plants closed, the U.S. was venting so much more methane that total greenhouse-gas emissions may have increased during the Obama years. Just as bad, the flood of cheap natural gas retards the necessary swift conversion to sun and wind, which produce no emissions at all. Ten years ago, natural gas was seen as a bridge; now, it's clearly a sharp detour away from renewable energy and toward an ever-hotter future.</P><P>Standing up to natural gas will be hard, because it's where the fossil-fuel industry increasingly concentrates its investments. (Exxon, to the surprise of some, opposed the Paris withdrawal – that's because the company sees its gas business benefiting as <mark>carbon</mark> cuts go into effect but methane is left unregulated.) And it's easy for politicians to play rhetorical games here: If you just talk about &quot;<mark>carbon</mark>,&quot; then gas looks good. But physics, again, is unimpressed by spin. It just adds up all the greenhouse gases in the air, and then it does its thing. Our job is to make sure that truly clean power comes next – we can't waste another few decades playing around with gas.</P><P>So now it's up to the rest of us to make sure this dark moment produces real gain. If we let politicians simply &quot;stand up for science&quot; or promise to someday reincarnate the Paris accord, then we will never catch up with <mark>climate change</mark>. If instead the rage that Trump has provoked catapults us into truly serious action – well, that will be the best revenge. </P><DIV id=""module-more-news""><H3 class=""module-header"">More News</H3></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></SECTION></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general, came to the EPA on a mission to change it from within. Since its founding in 1970 under Republican President Richard Nixon, the agency’s primary task has been to keep people safe from toxic pollutants. Pruitt has pioneered a radically different approach to environmental regulation, weighing impact on job growth and the concerns of business groups on a level plane with environmental protection when the law allows. In March, less than a month after speaking with the CEO of <A href=""http://fortune.com/fortune500/dow-chemical/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><mark>Dow Chemical</mark></A>, the primary maker of chlorpyrifos, Pruitt reversed course, delaying a decision on the pesticide until 2022. (An EPA spokesperson said the conversation was brief and chlorpyrifos was not discussed.)</P><P>In an interview with TIME on Oct. 18, Pruitt dismissed criticism of his industry-friendly approach. “I don’t spend any time with polluters. I prosecute polluters,” he says. “What I’m spending time with is stakeholders who care about outcomes. I think it’s the wrong premise. It’s Washington, D.C.–think to look at folks across the country–from states to citizens to farmers and ranchers, industry in general–and say they are evil or wrong.”</P><DIV class=""component inline image margin-16-top margin-24-bottom align-img align-center""><DIV class=""image-wrapper""><DIV class=""component lazy-image

Since he took office, more than a dozen EPA regulations have been killed or put under review, from fuel-efficiency standards to regulations on the disposal of coal ash to restrictions on toxic metals like arsenic in waterways. Moreover, the Trump Administration has proposed slashing funding for the agency’s law-enforcement branch, which identifies polluters under existing regulations.</P><P>All this has aided businesses, propping up the declining coal industry, ensuring profit margins for chemical makers and reducing compliance costs for farmers. But the change has also weakened an agency designed to save lives. “They’re trying to deconstruct and dismantle the basic protections,” says Mustafa Ali, a career EPA official who resigned in March after 24 years. “They’re creating situations where more folks are going to get sick, some folks are going to die, more folks are going to be put in harm’s way.”</P><P><A href=""http://time.com/4995744/robert-redford-scott-pruitt/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Pruitt’s work at the EPA</A> is part of the Trump Administration’s larger project of rolling back decades of regulations across government. From the Departments of Education to Energy to Housing and Urban Development, Trump has appointed Cabinet Secretaries who are openly skeptical about the missions of the departments they now control.</P><P>Pruitt’s quest to remake the agency has gotten pushback from all sides: environmental groups that sue over every move, career staff reluctant to gut the EPA and even hard-line conservatives who think he moves too slowly. The outcome of these fights will be pivotal, not just for the Trump Administration and its supporters in industry but also for the well-being of millions of Americans.</P><P>Pruitt has made his immense wood-paneled office in Washington’s Federal Triangle his own. Framed baseball jerseys decorate one wall. Ronald Reagan memorabilia is displayed in a cabinet alongside a Fox News mug, and a bison bust rests on his desk in homage to his home state of Oklahoma. In conversation, he slips between chitchat and complicated policy, wrapping statements questioning the legitimacy of <mark>climate change</mark> in lawyerly language.</P><P>Yet Pruitt does not seem entirely at home at the EPA. His suite on the third floor of its neoclassical headquarters is often off-limits to most career staff. He travels with a 24-hour security detail, an unusual and costly move. During the early months of his tenure, he often chose a staffer’s office to make calls, presumably to stave off leaks. More recently, he installed a $24,570 soundproof booth to ensure that his phone calls are secure.</P><P>Pruitt rankled many of the agency’s career employees from the start. In a February speech, he painted the EPA as a federal bureaucracy run amok. He would change that, he declared shortly thereafter, by “getting back to basics” at the agency. “Our job is to enforce the law,” Pruitt tells TIME. “What has happened the last several years is that this agency–among others, but this agency particularly–has taken those statutes and stretched them so far.”</P><DIV class=""component inline image margin-16-top margin-24-bottom""><DIV class=""image-wrapper""><DIV class=""component lazy-image

In Pruitt’s view, protecting the environment is just one element of his job as the country’s chief environmental regulator, on par with promoting the economy. The move to protect business comes as little surprise to those who have followed Pruitt’s rise. Pruitt made his reputation in Republican circles as one of the EPA’s toughest critics; as Oklahoma attorney general, he sued the agency 14 times. A 2014 New York Times report documented how on several occasions Pruitt sent complaints to the EPA at the request of energy companies, copying their proposed language nearly word for word on his official letterhead. Since moving to Washington, Pruitt has selected former industry officials as chief advisers. Schedules released in response to open record requests show that his calendar has been crammed with meetings with industry executives, from the president of Shell Oil Co. to Bob Murray, the Ohio coal baron. The rare meetings he has taken with environmental groups have not accomplished much. “None of us are under any illusion about who he is and what he represents,” David Yarnold, who heads the National Audubon Society, told TIME after meeting with Pruitt in April.</P><P>Pruitt’s approach to dismantling environmental regulations often follows a pattern. First, the administrator meets with an industry group. Then the group petitions for a regulatory change. Soon after, Pruitt announces a review along the lines the group requested. In most cases, Pruitt does not argue that regulations have no benefits. Instead, he attacks them as inconsistent with the letter of the law and argues that the economic costs outweigh the benefits.</P><P>Take the Clean Power Plan, which was devised by the Obama Administration as a way to fight <mark>climate change</mark>. Many conservatives abhor the rule because it intervenes in state energy policy and hurts the GOP-friendly coal industry. When it was announced in 2015, the EPA estimated the measure would slash the amount of sulfur dioxide emitted by power plants by 90% and cut nitrogen oxides by more than 70%. Both pollutants contribute to smog as well as a substance known as particulate matter, which triggers heart attacks, aggravates asthma and affects lung function. According to the EPA’s 2015 analysis, the plan would have saved 3,600 lives by 2030 and offered health and <mark>climate</mark> benefits of at least $34 billion a year.</P><P>But Pruitt rejects the idea that the agency should consider such health data and tells TIME that addressing such <mark>pollution</mark> should be left to other regulations. As he reviewed the Clean Power Plan over the past seven months, Pruitt has focused instead on the billions of dollars that the regulation costs the coal and power industries, accusing the Obama Administration of federal overreach. The rule was stayed by the Supreme Court, bolstering Pruitt’s overreach argument. “We shouldn’t put up fences. We shouldn’t say we have this tremendous natural resource, don’t touch it,” Pruitt tells TIME. The EPA, he says, should be about “managing that natural resource–whether it’s water or fossil fuels or land.” In October, Pruitt began the process of canceling the plan.</P><P>He’s right that the regulation would have hastened the decline of the coal industry, though energy analysts say his move won’t save it. And coal carries costs of its own. “It’s extremely shortsighted,” Christine Todd Whitman, a former Republican governor who ran the agency for two years under President George W. Bush, says of Pruitt’s opposition to the plan. “To clean up the air, to help reduce that from an economic point of view makes a huge amount of sense.”</P><P>Pruitt has taken a similar approach to chlorpyrifos. The EPA banned the chemical from most residential usage in 2000, citing a suspected link to brain defects in children. Since then, scientific data has shown that farmworkers and children in agricultural communities are particularly at risk. One study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, indicated that children born in close proximity to a farm where the chemical has been used have lower IQs than their counterparts born elsewhere. Another study of pregnant women by Columbia University researchers found that exposure to the chemical changes the brain structure of their children. But farmers around the world rely on chlorpyrifos. And while <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> does not say how much it makes from the product, the company has said in court that it would be “significantly impacted” by a ban. In addition to those costs, Pruitt has argued that the science is not conclusive. A federal court ruled in the EPA’s favor on the matter in July.</P><P>Pruitt’s moves alarm not only environmentalists and public health advocates but also many moderate Republicans. “There is no precedent for the range of apparently skeptical reviews of EPA regulations,” says William Reilly, who ran the agency under President George H.W. Bush. “I’m not confident that the integrity to the entire legal apparatus is really safe.” Some industry officials who worry about economic stability almost as much as overregulation say Pruitt may tip the balance too far in one direction, setting up the agency for another dramatic shift when a new President comes to town. “Virtually everyone in the business community believes that EPA needs to issue a replacement rule” to address <mark>climate change</mark>, says Jeff Holmstead, a senior EPA official under George W. Bush who now represents energy companies. “They think they would be better off with a reasonable regulation than with no regulation at all.”</P><P>Meanwhile, critics on the right complain that Pruitt has not gone far enough. Myron Ebell, who led Trump’s EPA transition team, says he wants Pruitt to challenge the EPA’s endangerment finding–the scientific document underpinning the agency’s global-warming regulation. “It’s essential,” Ebell says. But Pruitt is savvy about which battles he picks. Challenging the endangerment finding would trigger a legal fight much like that which ensnared Trump’s ill-fated travel ban. Instead, Pruitt has devised a strategy to publicly debate–and likely undermine–<mark>climate</mark> science while working bureaucratic channels to weaken regulation behind the scenes.</P><P>All this has earned Pruitt Trump’s ear as well as his praise. Trump has cited the work of the EPA, and the decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement–a move that bears Pruitt’s fingerprints–on a short list of his top accomplishments. “One of the biggest areas of success for the Trump Administration has been turning around really big regulations,” says West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey, who worked with Pruitt on the Republican Attorneys General Association. “Pruitt is the driving force behind that.”</P><P>In some ways that’s because he is the President’s stylistic opposite. While Trump speaks in generalities and governs by tweet, Pruitt can talk the nuts and bolts of policy and works the levers of his agency slowly and subtly. If the President is impulsive, Pruitt thinks two steps ahead. It is a measure of his political acumen that he has thrived despite often being at odds on <mark>climate policy</mark> with some of the President’s closest confidants, such as his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.</P><P>It is one reason why many observers believe Pruitt has his eye on a political job, such as governor of Oklahoma or one of the state’s U.S. Senate seats. For all his impact at the EPA, Pruitt seems destined to spend much of his time at the agency battling environmentalists and blue-state attorneys general, who are filing lawsuits to challenge every regulatory rollback. This summer, a federal court rejected an attempt to delay a rule curbing methane emissions, and Pruitt backed off a similar delay to a rule on ozone.</P><P>But even if Pruitt were to depart today, his tenure would still leave a substantial mark. The chemicals and pollutants spilling into our air and water will not just disappear when a new EPA chief comes to town. And neither will the health effects. Just ask Bonnie Wirtz. “This shouldn’t be happening,” she says of the EPA delay on chlorpyrifos. “We have the scientific evidence for a ban. Let’s do it.”</P><P><EM>This appears in the November 06, 2017 issue of TIME.</EM></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""bottom-recirc padded-mobile "" data-tracking-zone=""bottom-recirc""><DIV class=""component lead-gen clearfix bottom-recirc"" data-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3365&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABPFT&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-mobile-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3365&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABPFT&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-partial=""sponsored-tile"" data-variation=""bottom-recirc"" data-title=""SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT"" data-provider=""dianomi"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-bottom-recirc"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-right-rail"" data-logo=""http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png"" data-logo_url=""https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&amp;utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank"" data-native_ad=""%7B%22dimensions%22%3A%22482x100%22%2C%22placement%22%3A%22footer%22%2C%22priority%22%3A6%7D"" data-nativekey=""KRVQvVbckcRMP4FTYBYnvWqY""><DIV class=""title-wrapper""><H3 class=""subtitle"">SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The two candidates remaining are a Democrat and a Republican, though partisan differences within the state have varied with national politics. (See Governor John Bel Edwards, a gun-supporting Democrat, as one example.) However, the ideological differences between these two would-be senators are made more stark by the fact that in vulnerable and flood-prone Louisiana, there’s still disagreement on whether to accept <mark>climate change</mark> as human-made.</P><P>This runoff is happening now because of Louisiana's quirky state election rules: Louisianans originally cast their vote for Senate in a non-partisan primary in November. If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote, then the state holds a runoff election in early December between the top two candidates.</P><P>Foster Campbell, the top remaining Democratic candidate, has been vocal about the fact that <mark>climate change</mark> could cause “irreversible damage” to Louisiana’s ample coastline. John Kennedy, the Republican candidate and current polling favorite, has largely avoided the subject. Kennedy told <A href=""http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/elections/article_349f95d2-78e5-11e6-91b8-8f76fd380d99.html"">Louisiana-based paper <EM>The Advocate</EM></A> this fall that although he accepts the fact that global temperatures are rising, he does not think there is evidence to explain why this is happening.</P><P>As Ars has noted before, this is false.

The state has already started to relocate residents whose homes are constantly being flooded—the first “<mark>climate</mark> refugees,” <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/us/resettling-the-first-american-<mark>climate</mark>-refugees.html"">as <EM>The</EM><EM>New York Times</EM></A> called them. And just this August, Louisiana experienced some of the most dramatic flooding since <A href=""http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/08/nasa-versus-nature-august-29-2005/"">Katrina</A> after massive rainstorms resulted in <A href=""http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/08/louisianas-1000-year-floods-inundated-80000-homes-and-businesses/"">20,000 rescues</A>. A group of <mark>climate</mark> scientists <A href=""http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/was-august-deluge-in-louisiana-worsened-by-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">then found that an extreme weather event like that</A> is more likely in Louisiana today than it was 150 years ago... <EM>due to human-caused changes in <mark>climate</mark></EM>.<P>So while it seems like self-preservation would make addressing <mark>climate change</mark> a bipartisan issue, Louisiana's economy complicates the matter. This state is rooted in the oil and gas industry, which means that pleasing those companies and employees is no doubt a judicious move politically. The industry employs roughly 84,000 Louisianans, according to a 2015 average <A href=""http://www.dnr.louisiana.gov/index.cfm?md=navigation&amp;tmp=iframe&amp;pnid=0&amp;nid=336"">published by Louisiana's Department of Natural Resources</A>.</P><P>“The problem has to be addressed with market-based solutions rather than government,” Kennedy told <EM>The Advocate.</EM> “I support energy conservation, nuclear energy, and encouraging technology to burn clean-burning coal. I don’t support a cap and trade policy. I don’t support an energy tax. If it’s such a swell idea, let China go first.” (China is <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/china-will-start-the-world-s-largest-<mark>carbon</mark>-trading-market/"">already implementing cap-and-trade schemes</A> that will be enforced in specific regions in 2017.)</P><DIV class=""story-sidebar-part""><DIV class=""story-sidebar-part-content""><H3>Further Reading</H3><A href=""https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/08/nasa-versus-nature-august-29-2005/"">NASA versus Katrina: August 29, 2005</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE>Unfortunately, a laissez-faire attitude toward &quot;market based solutions&quot; has been the order of the day for decades, and it has resulted in the federal government having to step in and give Louisiana $48 million to resettle residents of Louisiana's southern Isle de Jean Charles due to flooding.<P>Ars tried to contact Kennedy’s campaign multiple times and never received a response. On the other hand, Campbell is more forthcoming about his opinions on the reality of <mark>climate change</mark>. In a statement to Ars, the campaign wrote that coastal land loss due to rising ocean levels and erosion is the most immediate threat to Louisiana.</P><P>&quot;<mark>Climate change</mark> has the potential for irreversible damage to our fishing and tourism industries and the health and well-being of our citizens, and because of this it is a primary concern for Foster,&quot; the campaign noted.</P><DIV class=""story-sidebar-part""><DIV class=""story-sidebar-part-content""><H3>Further Reading</H3><A href=""https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/01/new-study-sheds-light-on-what-happens-to-women-who-are-denied-abortions/"">New study sheds light on what happens to women who are denied abortions</A></DIV></DIV>Of course, one issue does not an election make. And despite a flood of <A href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/louisiana-s-foster-campbell-democrats-last-hope-pick-senate-seat-n693226"">out-of-state grassroots support</A> coming in for Campbell in a post-Trump country, Louisianans will be the deciders, and they know the nuance of state issues better than others. Campbell has proven to be a distinctly Louisiana Democrat; he's a Catholic who has campaigned on a <A href=""http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/01/new-study-sheds-light-on-what-happens-to-women-who-are-denied-abortions/"">regressive</A> pro-life platform for example. But he also cites Pope Francis’ call for humans to take responsibility for <mark>climate change</mark> and calls for regulation of the oil and gas industry, especially given that his state <A href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/07/images-from-immediate-aftermath-of-the-deepwater-horizon-oil-spill/"">suffered after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill 6 years ago</A>.<P>“Louisiana's river ports, offshore rigs, and refineries effectively serve as the gas station for our entire country,&quot; his campaign noted. &quot;The bulk of the oil produced in the United States is refined in Louisiana—so the clout to address <mark>climate change</mark> and pressure the oil and gas industry to pay for the portion of our coast they've damaged is there if we elect a Senator with the willpower to wield it.”</P><P>Although Campbell’s realism about <mark>climate change</mark> makes him unique, Kennedy led the first vote with 25 percent of the electorate. He <A href=""http://www.theadvocate.com/acadiana/news/politics/elections/article_8628c520-b816-11e6-8507-13e76f2c3518.html"">has consistently led the polls in the runoff election</A> since. Should Kennedy win, he would go to Washington under an administration that has been openly hostile to <mark>climate</mark> science, most recently appointing <mark>climate change</mark> denier and Oklahoma Attorney General <A href=""http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/12/trump-tabs-oklahoma-attorney-general-friend-to-fossil-fuels-to-run-epa/"">Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency</A>.</P><P>What little comfort scientific realists can take is that during the November 8 primary, Kennedy and Campbell were just two in a list of eight major candidates (the <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/louisiana-senate"">race</A> had even <EM>more </EM>candidates and gained some national attention because former KKK official David Duke was one of them). No single candidate came close to a majority, let alone topping 30 percent. And of that initial group, Campbell was again the only one to accept <mark>climate change</mark> as fact. The other six major party options had dramatically bad opinions about <mark>climate policy</mark>.</P><P>In the primary, Caroline Fayard, a Democrat, agreed that <mark>climate change</mark> was happening but wouldn’t say whether she agreed that humans were responsible for it. John Fleming, a Republican representative for Louisiana and a doctor, <A href=""http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/elections/article_349f95d2-78e5-11e6-91b8-8f76fd380d99.html"">told <EM>The Advocate</EM></A>, “It’s very unscientific to say we had a big rain so it was caused by global warming.

There is no data showing that it was caused by global warming.” Rob Maness, a retired Air Force colonel and a Republican, said that Hillary Clinton and the tax code were &quot;a bigger threat to the nation than CO<SUB>2</SUB>s.&quot;</P><P>No matter Saturday's result, at least all of those candidates lost.</P><P><EM>Listing image by <A href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/karenapricot/2834316875/in/photolist-dS5Hcn-64qbTH-5jspTg-rqdxW2-ohtiPf-5sf5WV-5jsfpn-5sjsd1-5jsBEk-5jwYVw-5jwnVy-5jwX1L-5jwX25-5jwtgd-5sjswf-5jsfq2-5jwtfQ-5jsBEr-5sf6U8-5jwnVs-5jwtfY-5jspU2-5jspTB-5jwX2j-5jsfpK-o1aUiw-r6UfL6-ofCdpy-o1bddj-5sjtem-5jstVe-5jsfpt-5jwtfU-5jwX1C-5jstVc-5jsBEz-5jsBEg-5jsfpz-8gtBLh-5jsBEM-5jwtgo-5jstV4-5jstV2-5jspTV-5jwtg3-5jsfpT-5sjsCU-5sjsjw-5jwnUY-5sjsSU"">Karen Apricot</A></EM></P></DIV><SECTION class=""inline-video"" title=""The Greatest Leap, Episode 3: Triumph"" data-video-overlay-template-id=""tmpl-5a340160148bb05431000005""><H3>Latest Ars Video <SPAN>&gt;</SPAN></H3><DIV class=""video-description""><H2>The Greatest Leap, Episode 3: Triumph</H2><SPAN>In honor of the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Apollo Program, Ars Technica brings you an in depth look at the Apollo missions through the eyes of the participants.</SPAN></DIV><TEMPLATE type=""text/template"" id=""tmpl-5a340160148bb05431000005""><FIGURE class=""video""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption""><DIV class=""caption-text"">The Greatest Leap, Episode 3: Triumph</DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H3>The Greatest Leap, Episode 3: Triumph</H3><P class=""excerpt"">In honor of the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Apollo Program, Ars Technica brings you an in depth look at the Apollo missions through the eyes of the participants.</P></TEMPLATE></SECTION></DIV><DIV class=""column-wrapper""><DIV class=""left-column""><SECTION class=""article-author""><DIV class=""author-bio""><SECTION class=""author-bio-top""><A href=""/author/megan-geuss"" class=""author-name"">Megan Geuss</A>

Schindelheim interviewed CEOs from four of America’s leading companies to get their take on closing the skills gap in the United States.</EM></P><P><EM>This week, Schindelheim interviewed CEO Andrew Liveris of <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> about solutions to the skills gap and how Dow is developing skilled workers through apprenticeships and STEM education outreach.</EM></P><P>“Ultimately, closing the skills gap is not just about helping one company, one sector, or even one country succeed,” according to <A href=""http://www.dow.com/en-us/about-dow/our-company/leadership/andrew-n-liveris"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Andrew Liveris</A>, CEO of <mark>Dow Chemical</mark>, a global, American company, and the <A href=""http://www.dow.com"">world’s second-largest chemical company</A>. “It is about addressing an array of global challenges, from <mark>climate change</mark> to food and water scarcity to the rising demand for <mark>sustainable</mark> housing and infrastructure. <mark>Innovation</mark>, driven by a <A href=""https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2017/science-technology-engineering-and-mathematics-stem-occupations-past-present-and-future/home.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">workforce skilled in STEM</A>, is the key to delivering the solutions that humanity needs.”</P><P>“The problem is not unique to the U.S.,” Liveris tells me. “As the global economy continues to rapidly evolve – and as digitalization, in particular, reshapes entire industries – world leaders are grappling with the question of how to reskill their workforces for the jobs of the future, especially in STEM.”</P><P>Liveris believes the current shortage of highly-skilled workers “is one of America’s greatest obstacles to economic competitiveness, sustained growth, and a healthy middle class” and represents a particularly urgent issue for American manufacturers, like his company. “Dow currently faces challenges in meeting all of our STEM workforce needs, particularly in identifying well-trained individuals to fill process technician and skilled-trades roles in some locations. As we look into the future, we do not see the steady stream of students entering into manufacturing STEM fields that are vital to invent and innovative new solutions to the world’s increasingly complex challenges.”</P><P><STRONG>RELATED STORY:</STRONG><A href=""https://workingnation.com/coming-next-week-americas-top-ceos-weigh-closing-skills-gap/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">America’s top CEOs weigh in on closing the skills gap</A></P><P>The statistics Liveris cites are troubling. 99% of the new jobs created in the U.S. from 2008 to 2006 required some form of post-secondary education or training, though not necessarily a four-year degree. Compare that to the percent of students at U.S. colleges and universities <A href=""https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/dt16_322.10.asp?current=yes"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">majoring in STEM fields – less than 10%</A>. “In addition to the hundreds of thousands of manufacturing job vacancies today, the sector is expected to add 3.5 million jobs over the next decade”, according to Liveris. “At the current rate, however, more than half of them – 2 million – will remain unfilled due to a lack of qualified candidates.”</P><P>To tackle the challenges of the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century says Liveris, “building the workforce of tomorrow must be one of our highest priorities.” He suggests “higher education alone will not solve the problem.”</P><P>Action speaks louder than words, and <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> is taking action. It is seeking short- and long-term solutions in public-private partnerships, an essential piece of keeping the high-skilled talent flowing into the workforce. “In the U.S., we are looking into revamping apprenticeship programs, creating more technical two-year college programs, and developing a national skills certification so that employers have assurances that their workers are qualified, even without a four-year degree on their resumes,” says Liveris, who gave me some examples.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Dow’s U.S. Apprenticeship Program</EM></STRONG></P><P>“Developed alongside Siemens and Alcoa five years ago, (it) has grown to 130 apprentices across four states. Through partnerships between Dow and local community colleges, <A href=""http://www.dow.com/en-us/careers/career-areas/manufacturing-and-engineering/us-apprenticeships#"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">these apprentices work toward an associate’s degree</A> in one of three specialized fields, with their tuition fully paid by Dow, while receiving three years of world-class training and on-the-job experience.”</P><P><STRONG><EM>Dow USAP Program</EM></STRONG></P><P>“(It) is a three-year program that is registered with the Department of Labor and includes both formal education (Associate’s degree) and on-the job training for Instrument Electrical Technician, Process Technician, and Millwright roles. While the program is open to all qualified candidates, we additionally market to high school students and military veterans. This is providing us with a great pipeline of highly qualified professionals to fill critical roles.”</P><P><STRONG><EM>Community College Partnerships</EM></STRONG></P><P>“We also partner with community colleges in communities near our largest sites. In Michigan, we have developed a <A href=""http://www.delta.edu/workforce-training/fast-start.html"">Fast Start</A> program with Delta Community College for rapid job placement in positions with our Michigan manufacturing sites. In Freeport, Texas, all of our process technology operators are hired from <A href=""http://brazosport.edu/programs/workforce/ChemTech/ProcessTech/"">Brazosport College</A>, which we work very closely with to help develop and sustain relevant curriculums.”</P><FIGURE id=""attachment_6542"" style=""width: 449px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Dow’s STEM Ambassadors teach the next generation of chemists.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Liveris says <mark>Dow Chemical</mark>’s commitment to building the workforce of tomorrow needs to start even earlier, as early as grade school.</P><P>“We are committed to advancing manufacturing STEM fields by getting students excited about STEM subjects, supporting our educators, and creating career advancement pathways through global university and local community/technical college partnerships. Under my leadership, Dow has mobilized employee volunteers, known as <A href=""http://www.dow.com/en-us/science-and-sustainability/global-citizenship/stem-ambassadors"">STEM Ambassadors</A>, to support teachers and inspire students by providing real-life examples to make technical concepts easier to understand and to share insights on exciting opportunities in STEM careers.

When you work at the intersections of science and society, you cannot afford to have a narrow view of the world,” Liveris tells me. “By reflecting the differing experiences, backgrounds and perspectives of the world in which we operate, we can bring a total view to the solutions table, unleashing the power of the human element and enabling us to recruit and retain the best and the brightest<EM>.”</EM></P><P>According to Liveris, fixing the skills gap is a global issue: “No single company or sector can tackle America’s workforce challenges on its own. In order to drive prosperity, we must all work together at the intersections of business, government, and civil society to provide the education and training, particularly in STEM, that is needed for this new generation of workers. STEM education and career fields drive the <mark>innovation</mark> needed to solve the major challenges humanity is facing. The bottom line is this: when we prepare our people to work for the global economy, then we can finally build a global economy that works for everyone.”</P><P><STRONG>Join the Conversation:</STRONG> What can schools do to boost STEM education?

It has also allowed the company to boost its renewable energy target from 400MW to 750MW, in pursuit of its 2025 Sustainability Goals.</P><P>“Dow is proud to be the first company in the United States to power manufacturing sites with renewable energy at this kind of scale and that we’ve become one of the largest corporate purchasers of wind energy in America,” said said Dow’s corporate vice president and chief sustainability officer Neil Hawkins in s statement last week.</P><P>“We appreciate this new collaboration with NRG at our Freeport site.”</P><P>Dow’s president of feedstocks and energy, Jack Broodo, described the NRG deal as a “game changer” for a big industrial that used to rely on grid power, fossil fuels, natural gas, coal and oil to power its plants.</P><P>“Through cost-advantaged power, Dow is manufacturing materials through renewable energy in one of the largest-scale industrial partnerships in the world,” he said.</P><P>Seth Roberts, Dow’s global business director of the Energy and <mark>Climate Change</mark> portfolio, said adding large-scale renewables to the company’s manufacturing process was just one smart move it could make to secure a future of sustainability, growth, and long-term competitive advantage.</P><P>“This decision also serves as a systemic hedge against both energy and power price volatility, while improving our overall <mark>carbon</mark> footprint,” Roberts said.</P><P>Of course, as the chart below by RE100 illustrates, Dow is not the only major corporation to tap into the multiple benefits of renewable energy.</P><P>As <A href=""http://qz.com/682669/these-companies-now-run-on-100-renewable-power/"" target=""_blank"">Quartz.com reported last week</A>, companies across the world are voluntarily signing up to source up to 100 per cent their power from renewable sources, either by buying it from established providers (Mars this week signed a deal with a Scottish wind farm that makes it 100 per cent renewable in the UK), or by building their own wind farms and solar arrays.</P><P>It should be noted that Google – the world’s biggest corporate purchaser of renewable power, with a target of 100 per cent – is not in the chart because the search engine giant doesn’t put its data in the public domain.

Last month, Pruitt reversed his own agency’s proposal to ban chlorpyrifos, which has <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/03/29/trump-epa-declines-to-ban-pesticide-that-obama-had-proposed-outlawing/?utm_term=.726b6a97498f"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">been linked to brain damage</A> in children exposed to the pest-killer.</P><P>It was against this backdrop that Dow, along with two other pesticide manufacturers, asked Trump officials to disregard government research that indicates a group of commonly used agriculture pesticides are harmful to 1,800 endangered and critically threatened animal species. In response, Dow is claiming these findings are flawed and should be “set aside” by the White House when considering proposed environmental protection rules. (When a team of the company’s own scientists examined the matter, Dow said, they came back with different results.)</P><P>Meanwhile Brett Hartl, a government scientist, is worried about how these chemicals could impact human health. “Endangered species are the canary in the coal mine,” he told the AP, since many of them reside in lakes and streams that serve as sources for human drinking water.</P><P>In response to the story, Dow said:</P><P>“No pest control product has been more thoroughly evaluated, with more than 4,000 studies and reports examining chlorpyrifos in terms of health, safety and the environment. Chlorpyrifos is authorized for use not only in the U.S., but nearly 100 nations, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Italy and Japan.

A photovoltaic solar system in the form of roof tiles, invisible to the naked eye? The solar world marveled at the ingenuity of Tesla, once more.</FONT></P><P>But the concept of solar shingles is not a new one. In fact, the technology to create such a product has been public knowledge since 2009 and solar shingles have been gracing the roofs of users since 2011.</P><P>As we move into 2018, when Tesla’s Solar Roof will see its full rollout, it’s important to remember where this technology came from, so that we can better predict where it is going.</P><P> </P><H3><STRONG>The History of Solar Shingles</STRONG></H3><H4><STRONG><mark>DOW Chemical</mark></STRONG></H4><P>The solar shingle concept was created by <mark>DOW Chemical</mark> Company, who first unveiled it in 2009. The company rolled out its Powerhouse Solar Shingle in 2011, and predicted at the time of announcement that it could see up to <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/dow-solar-idAFN0536825520091005?rpc=44""><STRONG>$10 billion in revenue by 2020</STRONG></A>.</P><P>The shingles were designed to blend in with a typical asphalt roof. They were heavily touted, due to their being an aesthetically pleasing alternative to traditional solar panels. Another added benefit of the shingles were the ease in which they could be installed, as there was no need for locating rafters and anchor points to bolt into, like with solar panels.</P><P>Using <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/im-getting-my-roof-redone-and-heard-about-solar-shingles/""><STRONG>Copper Indium Gallium Slenide solar cells</STRONG></A>, the shingles worked the same as most standard panels, pulling in the rays of the sun and converting it to electricity, before transferring it to an inverter box, from which it enters the home.</P><P>In 2009, when TIME Magazine declared DOW’s solar shingle one of the <A href=""http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1934027_1934003_1933958,00.html""><STRONG>50 Best Inventions of 2009</STRONG></A>, it was estimated that the solar shingle would sell for 10% to 15% less than traditional solar panels.</P><P>Unfortunately, that did not prove to be the case, as solar shingles ranged in price from $4 to $12 per-Watt, while traditional solar panels in 2015 were only $3.50 per-Watt (learn more about Solar Costs at <A href=""https://powerscout.com/home-solar/solar-panel-costs"">PowerScout</A>). Federal, state and local incentives helped to <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/im-getting-my-roof-redone-and-heard-about-solar-shingles/""><STRONG>decrease the price point</STRONG></A>, sometimes by almost half, but the product was failing to catch on as predicted. Before it’s downfall, Powerhouse had only been installed on 1,000 homes.</P><P><A href=""http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2016/06/dow_to_stop_manufacturing_powe.html""><STRONG>DOW discontinued the Powerhouse line</STRONG></A> in mid-2016, announcing the news on the same day the company cut 2,500 jobs globally.</P><H4><STRONG>Enter Tesla</STRONG></H4><P>Tesla threw their hat into the clean energy game in 2016 with its <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-17/tesla-seals-2-billion-solarcity-deal-set-to-test-musk-s-vision""><STRONG>$2 billion acquisition of Solar City</STRONG></A>. Following the termination of DOW’s Powerhouse shingles, many companies attempted to take over the industry. CertainTeed and Atlantis Energy Systems tried to compete, but Tesla has become the major name in the solar shingle game.</P><P>Once Tesla announced the Solar Roof to the masses they seemed to solidify their hold on the industry. In 2017, the first two variations of the Solar Roof were released in the form of textured and smooth glass.</P><P> </P><H3><STRONG>The Future of Solar Shingles</STRONG></H3><H4><STRONG>The Tesla Solar Roof</STRONG></H4><P>In 2018 we will see a full roll out off the Tesla Solar Roof, with Tuscan and French Slate designs on their way to American homes this year. While the performance of this new product remains to be seen, there are certainly a large number of pros and cons associated with it.</P><P>For starters, the Tesla Solar Roof touts an impressive layer of protection as compared to the average roof. Tesla has released <A href=""https://www.tesla.com/solarroof""><STRONG>a video test</STRONG></A>, which shows a Solar Roof panel pelted with a 2-inch ball of hail traveling at 100 mph. The Solar Roof withstands the impact perfectly while traditional roof tiles shatter like glass. Coupled with a lifetime warranty, it seems like a smart investment at face value. Traditional solar panels, however <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=M6v2lDa8Hos""><STRONG>are equally durable</STRONG></A>, so this is not a viable advantage that one product seems to have over the other.</P><P>The main issue plaguing the future of the Solar Roof seems to be its pricing. Much like DOW before them, Tesla may suffer from a market unwilling to shell out big bucks for their product when traditional solar panels cost so much less. <A href=""https://www.tesla.com/solarroof"">Tesla’s Solar Roof</A> is estimated at being <A href=""https://powerscout.com/site/wait-teslas-solar-roof"">70% more expensive than installing solar panels</A> on a home with a sturdy roof and 35% more costly than installing a solar panel system and having your roof fully replaced.</P><P>Another potential roadblock for the technology powerhouse is the energy output of their costly system. While the Solar Roof does produce enough power to save you money on your utility bills, it only produces 70% of the power generated by a traditional solar power system.</P><P>To top it off, competition is looming as DOW seeks to reclaim its lost throne.</P><H4><STRONG>The Return of DOW</STRONG></H4><P>Following an <A href=""https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2017/10/04/back-from-the-dead-new-deal-could-revive-dow-solar-shingles/""><STRONG>agreement between RGS Energy and DOW</STRONG></A>, the solar shingle market could start to see competition in the form of Powerhouse 3.0. Backed by the commercial prowess of RGS, the original solar shingle system could return with a bang and challenge Tesla’s dominance over the industry.</P><P>The major differentiating factor between Powerhouse 3.0 and its previous incarnations is an adoption of silicon solar cells, which reduces the cost of production, thus eliminating the biggest opponent of DOW’s past success, pricing.</P><P> </P><H3><STRONG>The 2018 Battleground</STRONG></H3><P>2018 proves to be a fascinating year for the solar shingle industry. The success of the Solar Roof is far from assured and it will be interesting to watch its successes or failures as the full rollout concludes. What’s more, are we fixing to see a knock-down drag out battle between Tesla and DOW? Could DOW’s new, less expensive Powerhouse shingles reclaim its lost industry?</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>KYLE PENNELL is from <A href=""https://powerscout.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://powerscout.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1517952687484000&amp;usg=AFQjCNELSWXBQQy7PH-FibQIVZ6QmxwkXw"">PowerScout, </A>a <SPAN class=""m_-8878842928812125479gmail-il"">marketplace</SPAN> that lets you compare multiple quotes for all your smart home improvement projects like home solar.</P><DIV><EM> </EM></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It is the basic ingredient in concrete (first used by the Romans), which paves our walks, supports our walls and even is used in our furniture in some cases. It is the essential substrate of modern life—and therefore the third largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (though dwarfed by fossil fuel consumption).

<P>Following it in the list of significant industrial sources in the U.S. are the production of iron and steel, ammonia, aluminum and petrochemicals—the building blocks of much of modern endeavor. A host of new techniques and technologies will be required to reduce emissions from these sources that includes reusing heat and power generated in manufacturing processes; recycling materials or substituting them; controlling greenhouse gases other than <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>); and, ultimately, capturing and burying the CO<SUB>2</SUB> produced. &quot;The key approach is energy efficiency, but its application has to be tailored to each specific industrial situation,&quot; says Lenny Bernstein, an environmental consultant and coordinating lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) report chapter on mitigating emissions from industry.</P><P>For example, cement manufacturers can use either blast furnace slag from steel mills or pozzolans—natural or manufactured reactive materials that increase the long-term strength of concrete—as substitutes for other, more traditional materials. Either reduce the energy needed to form the cement. Or manufacturers can use alternative fuels. &quot;Cement kilns are great for disposing of almost anything,&quot; Bernstein says. &quot;You can extend the fuel source with these and thus avoid the energy associated with new fossil fuels.&quot;</P><P>Already, a host of industries have voluntarily begun to cut back on their greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, primarily by controlling the gases other than CO<SUB>2</SUB> that contribute to <mark>climate change</mark>, such as methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>). &quot;The cost of reducing non-CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions is cheaper relative to reducing CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions, mainly because many of the technologies used to reduce emissions [in the former] also reduce costs to the firm through conservation and reuse of the gases,&quot; explains Casey Delhotal, another IPCC lead author who contributed to the industry chapter.</P><P>For example, <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> Co. has saved approximately $4 billion in energy costs between 1994 and 2005 by cutting greenhouse gas emissions 32 percent and its chemical industry competitor DuPont saved $3 billion between 1990 and 2005 while cutting such emissions 60 percent. &quot;These [voluntary] activities have led to significant reductions in emissions from some companies and some industries, but overall have not had a significant effect on emissions at the national or regional level,&quot; Bernstein says. &quot;Industry has certainly applied a great number of energy-efficiency options but so far those have been only or largely things where there's a return in terms of cost savings. There's a lot more energy efficiency that could be done but it has a cost to it.&quot;</P><P>Dealing with the emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, the most ubiquitous greenhouse gas, will require <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage (CCS) for the ammonia, cement and iron industries—and that will cost. But it will also be easier to apply—and therefore may pave the way for this critical technology to come into widespread use. &quot;The gas that comes off a blast furnace contains higher CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations than a coal-fired power plant,&quot; Bernstein says. Concentrated CO<SUB>2</SUB> is easier to capture, compress and inject into the ground, and ammonia plants, for example, are already typically built on or near subterranean deposits of natural gas, which might serve for geologic sequestration. &quot;For actually doing [CCS], that would be the lowest cost and the technologically simplest way to do it,&quot; says Bill Moomaw, an international energy policy expert at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.</P><P>Ultimately, however, energy efficiency and technology improvements will have the most critical role to play in the developing world, such as China and India, where much of the world's energy intensive industry is now located. And, although the physical manufacturing facilities are often more modern and efficient in these countries, simply because they are newer, the economic capacity and will to address emissions from these sources may not exist. &quot;How their future development goes and what they do or don't do to improve the performance of existing plants is going to determine the global emissions from this sector,&quot; Bernstein says. &quot;China is already the leading producer of steel, cement, nitrogen fertilizers and a couple of other energy intensive products.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3><SECTION class=""article-author""><DIV class=""article-author__main""><P class=""article-author__name t_body t_body--article"">David Biello</P><P class=""article-author__desc t_body t_body--article"">David Biello is a contributing editor at <EM>Scientific American</EM>.

Liveris said that he and other industry leaders advised Trump that the Paris accord might not be perfect, but at least it has allowed the US to be at table during international <mark>climate</mark> discussions. ‘He had a political problem,’ Liveris said of Trump. ‘The constituency that voted him in – frankly, the coal industry, the fossil fuel industry, the pipeline industry – was losing jobs.’</P><P>The policy and business worlds have intersected when it comes to <mark>climate change</mark>, Liveris said. ‘We are very profoundly having to cope with this intractable problem of increased emissions based on fossil fuels, and businesses like ours that are big users of fossil fuels have halved our use over the last 10 years,’ he told the RACI audience.</P><H3 id=""Business_bonanza"">Business bonanza</H3><P>Companies like Dow are driving solutions to the problem on the technology side, and the policy needs to follow, Liveris asserted. ‘When the politics don’t allow leadership, you have got to let the people who are affected really lead the policy environment, so that is what we’ve done,’ he said, noting that the US’s future in the Paris agreement is not dead. ‘I can’t speak to whether he is going to change his mind, but I can speak to the fact that it is not a finished conversation, and I am very involved in that,’ Liveris said. ‘I am very hopeful that we can get re-engagement on some terms that satisfy the politics of the US.’</P><P>He emphasised that the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> are being profoundly felt in Australia. ‘Essential natural resources are harder to get to, and frankly some of the ecosystems that make Australia unique are being destroyed, like the Great Barrier Reef,’ added Liveris, who himself was born, raised and educated in Australia.</P><P>Nevertheless, he argued that global warming and many of the other serious modern global challenges – like the need for clean water and adequate food and energy resources to satisfy a growing population – are increasingly being recognised and embraced by industry as business opportunities. ‘Over my career, I have witnessed a remarkable evolution in the way that companies like ours think about their responsibility to society, and the role that business can therefore play in solving problems and improving people’s lives,’ Liveris said. ‘These challenges actually provide a roadmap for a completely new business model – one where solving some of the world’s most pressing problems actually presents boundless business opportunities.’</P><P>Patent production at Dow is eight-fold higher than it was 10 years ago, and Liveris said this is because of these global trends. ‘Many of these inventions are not just good for Dow, but they are good for the world,’ he said, citing for example paint that removes toxic formaldehyde from indoor air, innovative packing technologies that eliminate waste in the food chain, as well as methods for desalinating and cleaning brackish water.</P><P>If individual companies such as Dow are seeing this sort of growth in innovative power, there could be ‘a new golden era of <mark>innovation</mark>’ in this century, or over the next few decades, according to Liveris.</P><H3 id=""The_need_to_engage"">The need to engage</H3><P>He urged scientists to help inform policy by <A href=""/3007220.article"">running for public office</A> or advising government. ‘This whole notion that we should sit on the outside and complain is gone,’ Liveris stated. ‘We all need to engage people, maybe even use the language of politics.’</P><P>In particular, he suggested that chemists and chemical engineers could make good policy advisers. ‘We are trained to break problems into component parts – down to molecules, electrons and even quantum states,’ he said. ‘By understanding these essential elements, these hidden processes that shape our environment, we can design solutions that transform the very fabric of our world.’</P><P>One policy area that Liveris and Trump agree on is the need to reform the US educational system, especially science and technology. ‘We have to fix education,’ Liveris told meeting attendees, noting that only 10% of the degrees coming out of four year universities in the US are awarded in science and technology fields, and roughly 40% of those graduating from such institutions don’t have jobs. He said the US’s teachers in elementary schools through high schools aren’t qualified to teach new scientists, pointing out that 30% of those that teach chemistry in US high schools have never even taken a chemistry course.</P><P>‘This is why I’m excited about President Trump’s work,’ Liveris said. ‘You are getting all the tweeting stuff and all of the distraction, but he has got a great team of people working on topics exactly like this,’ he added. Liveris is co-chairing an effort, sponsored by Trump’s daughter Ivanka, to retool the US education system. National programmes to expand apprenticeships and vocational training have been launched under this initiative, he said.</P></DIV><DIV class=""storyAuthor""><SPAN class=""author""><A href=""https://www.chemistryworld.com/rebecca-trager/1905.bio"" rel=""author"">Rebecca Trager</A></SPAN><SPAN class=""description"">US correspondent, Chemistry World</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""topics""><DIV class=""sleeve""><H2>Topics</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It appears that Dow’s latest 10-K filing does not provide decision-useful <mark>climate</mark> information, consistent with its voluntary reporting. </P><P>I spoke recently with Hawkins, who discussed the quality of Dow’s reporting. The company received an “application level” of A+ from the Global Reporting Initiative for its latest sustainability report.  The “A” represents the highest level of completeness in addressing core reporting topics, and the “+” represents external third-party report assurance.  Dow provides <A href=""http://www.dow.com/sustainability/pbreports/quarterly.htm"">quarterly updates</A> on progress towards achieving its sustainability targets, and it received 90 out of 100 points for the quality of disclosure in its 2013 CDP response.</P><P>Dow’s voluntary reporting and <A href=""http://www.dow.com/sustainability/goals/<mark>climate</mark>.htm""><mark>climate change</mark> position</A> show that <mark>climate change</mark> is a major strategic issue for the company. “No one has more at stake in the solution – or more of an ability to have an impact on – the overlapping issues of energy supply and <mark>climate change</mark> than we do,&quot; Hawkins said. </P><P>For 23 years, the company has set greenhouse gas reduction goals and tracked progress towards them.  In the <A href=""http://www.ceres.org/company-network/ceres-roadmap"">Ceres Roadmap for Sustainability</A>, a key expectation is that companies reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 25 percent from their 2005 baseline by 2020.  Since 1990, Dow has reduced its emissions by more than 30 percent.  Its current goal calls for maintaining absolute GHG emissions below 2006 levels.</P><P>These are impressive measures, but it’s time to bring investors into the equation.  A key part of the SEC’s mission is to protect investors by ensuring they have adequate information about risks companies face.</P><P>The SEC’s <mark>climate</mark> disclosure guidance, released in 2010, is focused on reporting regulatory, physical and indirect risks, as well as opportunities.  While the SEC could do more to educate companies about this issue, the guidance does lay out a clear set of expectations.</P><P>When the guidance was issued, SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2010/spch012710ebw-<mark>climate</mark>.htm"">explained</A> why more companies should discuss <mark>climate</mark> risks in their filings:</P><P>I am concerned by the fact that today many public companies are in fact providing disclosure about significant <mark>climate change</mark> related matters through mechanisms outside [of SEC filings]. While all of the information provided voluntarily by companies through these mechanisms undoubtedly is not required to be disclosed under our rules, I do not believe that public companies today are doing the best job they possibly can do with respect to their current mandated disclosures.</P><P>Dow’s annual 10-K filing, published in February, provides an incomplete message. Dow devotes four paragraphs to <mark>climate change</mark>. It’s unclear from the 10-K that <mark>climate change</mark> is a major strategic issue for the company, and its strategy sounds vague: “Dow will continue to focus on managing its energy and greenhouse gas emissions footprint and delivering solutions to help our customers manage theirs.”</P><P>Dow discusses its energy-efficient products, emissions reductions since 1990, the life cycle impact of its products, and several other issues.  Yet investors don’t get the full picture of how <mark>climate change</mark> relates to the company’s business strategy.</P><P>The 10-K also says little about <mark>climate</mark> risks, mentioning some facilities subject to the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme: “[H]owever, the Company has not experienced any considerable impact in regard to regulated GHG emissions from the EU ETS.”</P><P>Dow’s voluntary disclosure to the CDP paints a different picture, discussing 15 risks and opportunities in detail.  A couple of them may be material in the short term.  For example, <mark>carbon</mark> taxes or energy taxes present an opportunity, according to Dow.  In the 1-5 year timeframe, they are “very likely” to result in “increased demand for existing products/services”, with a “high” magnitude of impact on the company.</P><P>Dow discusses the potential financial impact of these risks in its CDP response, saying:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>All of the regulatory opportunity drivers [<mark>carbon</mark> taxes, product efficiency standards, and other drivers] will tend to drive the globe towards a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy.  To further develop these opportunities Dow is actively working to expand existing products and to develop new products that will allow customers to better meet the regulatory requirements.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Dow's 2012 CDP response said, “Dow believes that there is significant opportunity in the space and that it can grow sales of clean energy enabling products from $5 billion per year to $15 billion per year.” </P><P>Many S&amp;P 500 corporations say nothing about <mark>climate</mark> in their SEC filings. What about other chemical companies?</P><P>Among the 18 key competitors Dow listed in its 10-K, seven produce annual SEC filings, either 10-Ks or 20-Fs.  The others are foreign or private companies that do not report to the SEC.</P><P>The SEC filings of these seven companies reveal that only Dupont provided similar <mark>climate</mark> information to Dow in its 10-K filing.  The other companies provided less information, and in one case, no disclosure.</P><P>For example, ExxonMobil and Syngenta provided very little information.  Exxon mentioned regulatory risks and the general impacts they could have on the company, such as shifting demand towards lower-<mark>carbon</mark> fuels like natural gas.  Syngenta mentioned <mark>climate</mark> risks and opportunities to agriculture, energy efficiency, and its development of products that are more tolerant of drought, heat, and <mark>climate</mark> variability.</P><P>Owens Corning briefly mentioned <mark>climate</mark> in a discussion of various environmental regulations which could affect the company in the next 2-5 years.  Monsanto did not discuss <mark>climate</mark> at all.</P><P>Dow has taken a good first step towards integrated reporting by discussing <mark>climate</mark> in its 10-K.  There’s room for improvement, though. Investors need to hear about specific material risks and opportunities to make better investing decisions. </P><P>A recent <A href=""http://www.ceres.org/resources/reports/disclosing-<mark>climate</mark>-risks-2011/view"">Ceres report</A> offers companies an 11-point checklist for developing a <mark>climate</mark> strategy and improving their reporting. Point 10 is especially relevant, saying, “Be specific: Provide a particularized discussion of <mark>climate</mark> risks and opportunities with respect to specific company assets and operations.”</P><P>Dow’s voluntary disclosure lays out the company’s strategies and its most important risks and opportunities.  In comparison, the 10-K says little.</P><P>Readers should come away from the 10-K understanding that “no one has more at stake” than Dow on <mark>climate change</mark>, and how the company’s strategy and actions take that to heart.  However, that’s not the case right now.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""field field-name-field-greenbiz-topics-ref field-type-entityreference field-label-inline clearfix""><DIV class=""field-label"">Topics: </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The set of seven goals, announced last month, include “developing breakthrough <mark>innovation</mark>s,” “valuing nature” and “engaging employees for impact”. All together, they aim to improve the lives of 1 billion and deliver $1bn in cost savings and new cash flow for the company.</P><P>“We’re really focusing on taking the science and technology of Dow and devoting our efforts to finding new ways of doing business that will help companies collectively change our role in society,” says Neil Hawkins, Dow’s corporate vice president and chief sustainability officer.</P><P>Andrew Winston, a sustainability consultant and author, calls the goals “really impressive”. “Dow joins a very small number of companies setting goals about the impacts of their products across the life cycle and setting society-level impact goals,” he says. “I think Dow has hit the mark very well on thinking big and aspirational while putting concrete markers of progress in place.”</P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-3 | 1""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">Canadian mining company spied on opponents and activists in Brazil</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P>Sheila Bonini, CEO of The Sustainability Consortium, called the plan “admirable”, while David Levine, co-founder and CEO of the American <mark>Sustainable</mark> Business Council, called the goals “encouraging”. “There’s a legacy of producing chemicals that are harmful to environment and people, so efforts to develop and implement sustainability plans that incorporate public and environmental health can be important steps down a sustainability path,” he says. </P><P>This is the third time the Michigan-based company has announced sustainability goals, to be met over a 10-year period. They’ve grown bolder with each go around, reflecting the rising expectations for companies that want to be seen as sustainability leaders. </P><P>Dow’s first set of goals, laid out in 1995, focused on reducing the company’s <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. A decade later, the company shifted the focus to its “handprint” by addressing social as well as environmental challenges. For example, <A href=""http://storage.dow.com.edgesuite.net/dow.com/sustainability/goals/Breakthrough-to-World-Challenges-Dow-Unilever-on-Lifebuoy-TM-Soap-feat-POLYOX-TM-Polymers-White%20Paper-141009.pdf"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Dow partnered with consumer goods company Unilever</A> to create a high quality, affordable soap to improve personal hygiene in India and prevent the spread of infectious diseases. </P><P>Experts say setting and announcing sustainability goals holds companies accountable, and can spur dialogue and <mark>innovation</mark>.</P><P>“I believe this practice is even more important for companies in industries with questionable histories as it serves to put them in the public spotlight, make them answer some questions that they may not have previously asked, and ultimately can be a means through which to make them better,” said Robert Strand, executive director at the Center for Responsible Business at the University of California at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, of which Dow is a corporate partner.</P><P>Dow’s image could use a boost. The company recently announced that it would be <A href=""http://www.dow.com/news/press-releases/dow%20announces%20actions%20to%20streamline%20and%20remove%20stranded%20costs"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">cutting its global workforce by nearly 3%</A> – roughly 1,500 to 1,750 positions – as part of its move away from the chlorine business. And last week, Dow defended its <A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/dow-chemical-defends-chief-executive-over-spending-1430955677"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">CEO Andrew Liveris against allegations that he had used company funds</A> to finance his lavish lifestyle.</P><P>The company also has a long way to go to overhaul its reputation as a polluter. “Companies like Dow have a lot of money to do this kind of PR, and they do it because it works,” said Rick Hind, legislatives director of Greenpeace’s toxics campaign. “But it doesn’t really address the lion’s share of contamination that they’re responsible for.”</P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-3 | 2""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">Can Dow's approach to water recycling recharge its reputation?</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

Working in <A href=""http://www.nature.org/science-in-action/leading-with-science/dow-chemical-nature-conservancy-2014-progress.xml"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">a six-year partnership with The Nature Conservancy</A> at factories in Texas and Brazil, Dow has found, among other things, that large scale reforestation can be a cost effective way to reduce air <mark>pollution</mark> from a chemical plant.</P><P>As for Dow’s new goals, they are just that – goals. Dow says it has yet to launch the specific initiatives tied to each one. </P><P>“We’re saying this is where we want to go,” Hawkins says. “Then we call upon the creativity and passion of our 50,000-plus employees [to put forward] collaborations they’d like to bring into the company to drive <mark>sustainable</mark> development.” </P><P>Of the latest goals, “advancing a circular economy” – reusing products instead of disposing of them – and “leading the blueprint” have the potential to really drive change, according to Hawkins.</P><P>While he couldn’t specify new projects, Hawkins pointed to the company’s existing wastewater recycling program at its plant in the Netherlands as an initiative that will help create a more circular economy. The factory, located in the small seaport town of Terneuzen, uses around 22m cubic meters of water each year. To reduce water stress, Dow recycles 30,000 cubic meters of household wastewater each day, purifying it to make steam and feed its manufacturing plants. The company claims the program reduces energy by 95%, equivalent to 60,000 tons per year of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions.</P><P>Dow will also look at ways to reuse its plastic waste, Hawkins says, and also plans to focus on ways to help make agriculture, technology and the electronics industry more <mark>sustainable</mark>. </P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-3 | 3""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">Corporate America's position on the EPA's clean power act</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

In this case, it’s the fact that studies by federal scientists have found that chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion are harmful to almost 1,800 “critically threatened or endangered species.” Historically, groups like the Environmental Protection Agency would want to avoid killing frogs, fish, birds, mammals, and plants, which is why the regulator and two others that it works with to enforce the Endangered Species Act are reportedly “close to issuing findings expected to result in new limits on how and where the highly toxic pesticides can be used,” the AP reports.</P><P data-reactid=""228"">Luckily for Dow, the E.P.A. is now run by <mark>climate</mark>-change skeptic and general enemy of living things <STRONG>Scott Pruitt</STRONG>, who last month said he would reverse “an Obama-era effort to bar the use of Dow's chlorpyrifos pesticide on food after recent peer-reviewed studies found that even tiny levels of exposure could hinder the development of children's brains.” Plus, <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> C.E.O. <STRONG>Andrew Liveris</STRONG> is good buddies with President <STRONG><A href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/people/donald-trump#intcid=dt-hot-link"">Donald Trump</A></STRONG>. So, you can see how the company, which the AP reports also spent $13.6 million on lobbying last year, might feel like it is in the clear.</P><P data-reactid=""229""><A href=""https://apnews.com/a29073ecef9b4841b2e6cca07202bb67/AP-Exclusive:-Pesticide-maker-tries-to-kill-risk-study?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam"">According to the AP</A>, lawyers representing Dow and two other companies that manufacture the pesticides in question (known as organophosphates) have sent letters to the heads of the E.P.A, the Department of Commerce, and the Fish and Wildlife Service, asking them to “set aside” the results of the studies, claiming that they are “fundamentally flawed.” Not surprisingly, the scientists hired by Dow “to produce a lengthy rebuttal to the government studies” have come up with diverging results.</P><P data-reactid=""231"">In addition to Pruitt’s long history of, per the AP, aligning “himself in legal disputes with the interests of executives and corporations,” Dow has another reason to be hopeful the government will conveniently ignore any lingering concerns about killing off entire species: Andrew Liveris is a close adviser to Donald Trump who was literally standing next to the president in February when he signed an executive order “mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations.”</P><P data-reactid=""234"">Dow also donated $1 million to underwrite Trump’s inaugural festivities, the AP reports, but God help the person who dares to wonder aloud if the check was some sort of an attempt to curry favor with the administration.

But scientists warned that CFCs deplete the ozone layer, which protects the earth from the sun’s ultraviolet rays. Chemical companies first resisted, saying that alternatives were not economically viable. “They were awful, just like the coal industry,” Mr. Doniger said.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">But consumer concern about the chemicals led to slumping sales, and a handful of countries banned CFCs. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol agreement was created to completely phase out those chemicals.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">The alternatives available at the time, HFCs, were greenhouse gases with 1,000 times the heat-trapping potency of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide.

Even as the switch to HFCs was taking hold in the early 2000s, Honeywell and several other companies began research and development programs to study alternatives with far lower warming potential.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-1bytduc emamhsk0""><DIV class=""css-w71pwo emamhsk2""><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Europe tightened its regulations in 2011, with stricter laws aimed at phasing out HFCs in car air-conditioners. Regulators in the United States gave credits to domestic automakers for switching to HFC alternatives.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">In 2012, Honeywell set up a production base just north of Shanghai to make a more environmentally friendly HFC alternative known as HFO-1234yf. The company followed with a second plant north of Tokyo, and is set to open its largest production base in Geismar, La., early next year. It has spent $900 million on its alternative coolant program.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Since then, Honeywell has publicly voiced its support for stricter regulations, and in 2014, was one of <A class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/16/fact-sheet-obama-administration-partners-private-sector-new-commitments-"" title="""" target=""_blank"">a group of companies</A> to partner with the Obama administration in its bid to make amending the Montreal Protocol a priority.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">With the world phasing out HFCs, the company is set to reap the benefits of its investment. Though Honeywell does not break out specific figures for its chemicals business, it has said that sales of its HFC alternatives are rising fast, helping the company grow its annual revenues from its wider fluorine business by double digits to over $1 billion.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“This is an area where we are aligned with the environmental benefits,” Kenneth Gayer, vice president of fluorine products at Honeywell, said in an interview. “We anticipated the need for these regulations before people were even talking about global warming. Now, the world is going to use alternatives in a big way.”</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Other options are now available, including systems that use propane or ammonia, and companies throughout the supply chain are racing to adopt them. Coca-Cola, for example, has put more than 1.8 million refrigerated vending machines and other HFC-free equipment into service.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Still, some environmentalists caution against what they see as excessive influence by the corporate sector in shaping the way forward for cooling technologies.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-1bytduc emamhsk0""><DIV class=""css-w71pwo emamhsk2""><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Daikin makes a low-cost HFC alternative called HFC32 that has a relatively small global warming impact, and is seen as useful for markets like India. Daikin, based in Osaka, Japan, makes both air-conditioning hardware and chemicals. It has been putting some of its patents in the public domain to encourage local manufacturers to use its chemicals.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Ms. Carbajal, of Greenpeace, saw the aggressive promotion of HFC32 as problematic. The industry, she said, decides “what is low and what is high, and that’s why we are very concerned.”</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Ms. Carbajal said that while there was a range of better alternatives to HFCs, those were not the ones being adopted in some countries. “The problem is that the ambition has not been as high as we expected,” she said.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Damian Thong, who heads Asia technology research at Macquarie, said Daikin had backed HFC32 in an attempt to balance warming potential and higher energy efficiency.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Emissions from air-conditioners also come from generating the electricity they consume, Mr. Thong said. “The issue being glossed over is that focusing on global warming potential alone may be bad for the environment still,” he said.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Despite the remaining issues, the Kigali deal was an example of an emerging dynamic, where companies pre-empt environmental policy changes by developing more planet-friendly products, then push for regulation that grows that market, environmental experts say.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“More and more companies are looking further and further down the timeline to see what changes they can expect, and what they need to phase out of their products,” said Baskut Tuncak, a lawyer at the United Nations specializing in toxic chemicals.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“It shows regulations do drive <mark>innovation</mark>,” Mr. Tuncak said. “The more we have a global approach, the better it is, even for businesses.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""bottom-of-article""><DIV class=""Addendum-addendums--1F9r3""><DIV class=""Addendum-item--3Si_o""><STRONG class=""Addendum-type--uYTDD"">Correction:</STRONG> <DIV class=""Addendum-body--zYQjt"">An article on Monday about chemical companies’ backing for some regulatory moves to curb <mark>climate change</mark> misidentified one company that supports a move away from HFCs as refrigerants.

HBR Editor in Chief Adi Ignatius asked him about how the chemical company is trying to transform itself through environmental initiatives and a commitment to sustainability.</P><P>ADI IGNATIUS: DOW has a more complicated story even now because, you know, you’re making plastics, you’re making petrol-derivative products, which rely on fossil fuels. Is the point that you’re transitioning away from these products, or that that’s not the way to think about it?</P><P>ANDREW LIVERIS: Well, Petrochemical DOW and the boom era of substituting natural products with plastic products without due regard to the environment in the ‘70’s and ‘80’s is now being replaced by a full life cycle analysis of minimizing the footprint of the plastics in the environment. But humanity still wants those plastics, and so a big chunk of the responsibility on you being in plastics now is companies like ours have the resources to work on it, which is use less input, OK; produce less waste through the process, and then the product that goes out there is lighter and recyclable; and then be part of the answer in recycling it; and then be part of the answer in replacing it with renewables.</P><P>The DOW we put in place today is a nimble R&amp;D company because we’re much more willing to cannibalize ourselves in <mark>innovation</mark> cycles being shorter. That DOW will be less and less Petrochemical DOW and more and more materials-that-are-friendly-to-the-environment DOW.</P><P>And so again, when you go to the short cycle <mark>innovation</mark> sector where you’re substituting materials that are your own and you’re making a lot of profit, that’s a very different type of company than the petroleum/petrochemical company that we’re leaving.</P><P>ADI IGNATIUS:  Companies like yourselves, you know, eventually find that a lot of these initiatives actually pay off on the bottom line. They don’t initially, so I’m interested in, how do you bring along stakeholders in that early stage to really believe in this mission when there won’t be an immediate payoff?</P><P>ANDREW LIVERIS: Well, you’re right: you know, the financial community would really prefer that if you don’t have a business model to recoup your investment against that cost, well, because it’s an intangible, unless there’s some tangible way of measuring it—like, for example, a price on <mark>carbon</mark>—then they would prefer you not to invest in that.</P><P>How we overcome that in DOW is by doing full life cycle analysis on what we call our footprint and our handprint, our footprint being our facilities, our handprint being our products that we send out to the world. And when we do full life cycle analysis, and we look at the cost our products have in society versus the benefit they bring, we need to have a benefit that outweighs the cost.</P><P>If we can do it for emissions, like in <mark>carbon</mark>, if we can burn less BTUs so we emit less <mark>carbon</mark>, we can deliver that to the bottom line. And in fact, 2005 to 2015, we invested a billion dollars, and we can tangibly show to investors we saved six billion dollars.</P><P>And our new goals have us delivering two billion dollars of new value through 2025 by managing inputs for less outputs, by managing ourselves on emissions and on waste so we impact the environment less. These sorts of metrics, which we now track for ourselves, we can articulate to the investment community.</P><P>The denominator goals actually became the simplest to talk about to investors and to the financial community, which is look, there’s a license to operate, there’s a regulatory environment that comes through either federal or state or even local authorities, and those regulatory environments are born from inputs that are garnered from everywhere, and we need to be one of those that provide that input. In fact, we need to be a primary source because we have science-based input. So, having the EPA having access to our toxicology lab and our analytical lab so they can get sounder science to give the better regulatory answer so it wasn’t just a regulation in abstract. Being collaborative with NGOs so we could understand their views of what a regulatory environment would look like, these sorts of environments on the denominator, really, they’re a cost of doing business but actually if you think about it, rising tide lifts all boats.</P><P>And that’s our motto at Dow. Our mojo and motto is, always comply with the highest standard, no matter which country you’re operating in, and normally that highest standard is coming from the United States, although not always. That’s denominator driven. You can have that conversation with investors in the financial community because in essence if you don’t comply, you could be out of business.</P><P>ADI IGNATIUS: So, the U.S. federal government right now doesn’t seem to be making a lot of this a priority. How does that change things for you and how do you think it changes things for U.S. businesses generally?</P><P>ANDREW LIVERIS: Well, so our company, as we sit here today and as we move to 2025 and beyond, considers the entire initiative basically of sustainability as a business model. We think if we can have the objective of delivering pure water, clean water, to the 1.5 billion people in the world that don’t have access to it, or we can deliver energy efficiency into areas that are energy-scarce, that’s independent of the regulatory environment.</P><P>Here in the United States, what’s happening with the current administration is a peel back on regulations that would put forward without a lot of inputs and a lot of sound science. There’s no question the Obama administration allowed the agencies to proliferate regulations without doing the risk-reward benefit profiles at the front end. In 2009, the manufacturing sector regulatory cost per employee in the United States was $9,500. In 2016, that same number was $19,900. So, we had a doubling of regulatory costs.</P><P>So, what should be happening, and I think mostly is happening today, is many people who are regulated are being asked to come to the table and say, <EM>Well, here’s the regulations as it sits today. That makes no sense. How do we put in a smarter reg based on sound science? </EM>It’s a bit of a messy process, but it is what’s going on right now. We consider that ancillary to our main agenda of sustainability as our business model. So, in other words, we’re driving to put in place higher standards on the pillars that matter, and most of those are very much in the sweet spot of our science and our daily work. So, for example, food packaging. If we can deliver a package based on film, based on plastic, that actually has—is lighter, it’s more functional, it’s recyclable, and actually ultimately the holy grail is renewable, that’s a sustainability agenda that has a profit output that is beyond the regulation.</P><P>ADI IGNATIUS: I think you’re saying that the Trump administration, in your view, is more science-based on these issues than the Obama administration was. Is that—</P><P>ANDREW LIVERIS:  I think that’s a bridge too far. I think what I’m saying, or what I was trying to say, is they are much more interested in getting the input of those jurisdictions that are being regulated. So, the regulator is talking to the regulated, whereas, the Obama administration did not do that.</P><P>ADI IGNATIUS:  Gotcha. Sticking on the policy issue though, I think what companies like yours are doing definitely move the needle. They are models for other companies to follow if they’re interested in doing that, but they only add up to so much. At a certain point, policy is how big changes can happen. What is the role, what is the obligation of businesses to lobby for action in areas that you’ve made a priority?</P><P>ANDREW LIVERIS:  Well, I think this is the biggest challenge in front of all of us. It’s my passion, actually, that business, government and civil society, each one of us having a seat at the table and looking at the table with respect to we have to find the win-win-win, because civil society as we know it, whether it be an emerged developed country and or an emerging country, what we’re all doing as seven billion people and will do as nine billion people by 2050 is just simply not <mark>sustainable</mark>.</P><P>And if we take out various slivers of the problem, we will sub optimize and get bad answers, and I think sound public policy based on sound science means that the entry price today is collaboration across those jurisdictions of business, government, and civil society, and, you know, we have governments that are being elected and not elected based on populace positions around the world. That’s just a sign that civil society’s getting very frustrated and very angry because we’re not meeting the economic pillar of what governments are meant to do, which is to create jobs. And all the infrastructure that supports the creation of jobs—sound education, sound management of infrastructure and many of the things that are the price of entry to have stable civil society—are starting to be shaken.</P><P>And I think it’s the role of business then to be one of the catalysts for change, and I think you need to find more and more enterprises, big and small, that are actually willing to have a seat at the table and develop the sound public policy that drives you to more medium- to long-term vision.</P><P>Our collaborations are geared that way. Our community advisory panels that we have in every country in the world at every site that we’re at serve that purpose. In other words, whether it’s managing the neighbor next to the facility in Bahia Blanca, Argentina, or here in Midland, Michigan, the input of civil society is there on our plans.</P><P>I do think that is the minority today, and I think we need to find a way to elect people, to have business leaders who are not afraid to take a public position, and obviously be able to speak the language of civil society and all of its representatives.</P><P>ADI IGNATIUS: So, on the topic of those NGO partnerships, you‘ve had one with The Nature Conversancy on—to study how your operations rely on and affect nature. Is that something you would recommend to other CEOs, sort of, a partnership like that, and if so, why?</P><P>ANDREW LIVERIS:  The Nature Conservancy and DOW found each other because the thing that impressed us about them, and there are others—they’re not unique—they are very much conscious that business has to see the profit motive as a reason to be at the table. In other words, we’re not a non-for-profit. We are for-profit. And the right to do business based on treating nature such that nature rejuvenates and can be <mark>sustainable</mark> is the agenda they have. And a lot of that is based on the science that we have. The collaboration, which, using our engineers and our scientists and using their scientists and their public policy experts, is to develop a suite of tools to help decision makers rapidly assess the value of an ecosystem to a business or a community. And we’ve identified valuing nature, as we call these projects “valuing-nature projects,” there are many of these that we’re doing that are bottom line, but their mojo, their way of working with us,  is they understand we have to have them as bottom-line projects.</P><P>ADI IGNATIUS: What would be your advice for companies or CEOs who want to pursue a kind of long-term <mark>sustainable</mark> agenda? Where do you start?</P><P>ANDREW LIVERIS: Nearly much every enterprise I’m familiar with in the Fortune 200 or even higher, the Fortune 500, that’s got any number of decades behind them deeply rooted in their psyches is their values and their credo. If you can take your values and use your science, use your people and make it part of your strategic pathway forward in terms of how your products impact the environment, how your products impact humanity, and provide the highest standard such that you are a unique provider of that solution, such that therefore you can actually extract value from that by being that unique provider, what they’ll find is that society actually values it.</P><P>The profit pool might not necessarily come from a customer per se. It might come through a license to operate from a jurisdiction that you might not otherwise have gotten. It may come through a partnership model like with The Nature Conservancy.  Look for it as part of your business model, and don’t look for it as an initiative to the side.</P><P>ADI IGNATIUS: Are you currently feeling more optimistic or more pessimistic about the future of the environment and our, man’s stewardship over it?</P><P>ANDREW LIVERIS: There’s a big piece of me that wants to answer that question that says I’m feeling optimistic, but there’s a lead weight on my feet that keeps dragging me back to reality. The lead weight on my feet is that capitalism as a distributor of wealth is starting to fail, and that’s because more and more of the financial outputs of capitalism are going to fewer and fewer, which is of course leading to the populism wave.</P><P>But it also is because we have become, in many of the Western economies, very short-term in our thinking. In other words, many of these policies that I’m referring to, and many of the trajectories that companies like DOW are on, are multi-year, if not multi-decade, and having CEOs and boards who are willing to invest in the right to operate, license to operate with drivers that aren’t regulatory, in other words, the denominator drivers but numerator drivers, I think people intellectually get it, but the lead weight on people’s feet that grounds us in reality is the 90-day march to financial returns, earnings results of most companies. Most of the investments we’ve been making at DOW, they’ve been going back since the mid-90’s, and some of these returns are coming now.</P><P>It’s harder then to have the optimism, because the pressures on the leadership of public companies are becoming more and more short-term oriented, so it either needs to become part of the CEO agenda, or it’s not taken seriously by your owners or your communities or your employees or your customers. And so just like everything at the CEO table, whether it’s talent and people management, whether it’s marketing and sales, whether it’s government and public policy, the sustainability agenda needs to be the CEO agenda. If it’s the CEO agenda, I think people like me will become more optimistic.</P><P>ADI IGNATIUS: All right, Andrew. Thank you for your time.  Thank you for your insights.  It’s always a pleasure to speak with you.</P><P>ANDREW LIVERIS: Yes, and thank you for making me part of your very fascinating piece of work.</P><P>SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: That’s Andrew Liveris.

If we can, that's great. If we can't, that's fine.&quot;</P><P>In response, one CEO after another tweeted disappointment at the announcement, companies issued statements committing to action on <mark>climate change</mark> and one high-profile member of Trump's business advisory council said he would leave the forum in response, after earlier threatening on Twitter to do just that. &quot;Am departing presidential councils,&quot; tweeted Tesla and SpaceX CEO <A id=""PEBSL000988"" title=""Elon Musk"" href=""/topic/business/elon-musk-PEBSL000988-topic.html"">Elon Musk</A> on Thursday afternoon. &quot;<mark>Climate change</mark> is real.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said on Twitter he was &quot;deeply disappointed&quot; by Trump's decision and &quot;will double our efforts to fight <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; while <A id=""ORCRP009947"" title=""Microsoft"" href=""/topic/business/technology-industry/microsoft-ORCRP009947-topic.html"">Microsoft</A>'s Brad Smith said in a statement that &quot;we believe that <mark>climate change</mark> is an urgent issue that demands global action.&quot;</P><P><mark>Dow Chemical</mark> CEO Andrew Liveris, who was the driving force behind a letter signed by 30 high-profile CEOs earlier this month encouraging Trump to honor the U.S. commitment, said that his company would &quot;continue to collaborate with President Trump as well as other businesses, NGOs and academics&quot; on greenhouse gas reductions. In a statement following Trump's announcement, Intel said it &quot;firmly&quot; believes the United States should keep participating in <A id=""EVGAP00096"" title=""Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Accord"" href=""/topic/environmental-issues/paris-<mark>climate</mark>-accord-EVGAP00096-topic.html"">the accord</A>. &quot;Withdrawal won't change our investment in renewable energy, and we will continue to advocate for the U.S. to engage.&quot;</P><P>The response follows months of letters and outreach to Trump from companies in industries as diverse as manufacturing, technology and energy to remain part of the 195-nation accord, making arguments that went well beyond sustainability, good corporate citizenship or the need for American leadership. While Trump's explanation for exiting the accord was, in part, that it would hurt domestic manufacturing and cost U.S. jobs, CEOs' appeals to the president have been largely business-focused, saying rather that an exit threatens American competitiveness, raises the risk of negative trade implications and could hurt their ability to create jobs.</P><P>Leading up to the announcement, several CEOs made final arguments to Trump or issued pleas for staying in the deal. Bloomberg reported that on Tuesday Apple CEO <A id=""PEBSL000519"" title=""Tim Cook"" href=""/topic/business/technology-industry/tim-cook-PEBSL000519-topic.html"">Tim Cook</A> placed a call to the White House to urge the president to stay in. The same day, Musk tweeted an open threat to Trump, saying he would lose him on the business advisory councils if Trump exited the accord. &quot;I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH &amp; via councils, that we remain,&quot; Musk wrote.</P><P>When a follower asked him what he would do if Trump makes the call to exit, Musk said he would have &quot;no choice&quot; but to leave the White House councils of which he is a member.</P><P>The final push by CEOs also included letters that were featured in full-page ads in newspapers, such as one signed by 25 companies that ran in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal on Thursday and earlier in May. The ads were sponsored by the Center for <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy Solutions and the sustainability nonprofit Ceres and included a shorter version of a letter that was first signed in April, arguing that &quot;the United States can best exercise global leadership and advance U.S. interests by remaining a full partner in this vital global effort.&quot; Google, Intel, Unilever and Schneider Electric were just a few of the names that signed the letter.</P><P>Even ExxonMobil had appealed to Trump to stay in the agreement. In a letter dated May 9, CEO Darren Woods wrote to Trump in what the Financial Times called a &quot;last-ditch personal plea,&quot; arguing that staying in allows the United States to remain &quot;at the negotiating table to ensure a level playing field&quot; on energy sources. That letter followed a prior appeal by the fossil fuels giant, which remains under fire from shareholders over <mark>climate</mark> issues, to the White House in March.</P><P>Besides Musk, a few other members of Trump's advisory council had signed letters opposing withdrawal from the agreement. The May letter spearheaded by Liveris urging Trump to stay in the agreement was also signed by <A id=""ORCRP010217"" title=""JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co."" href=""/topic/business/financial-business-services/jpmorgan-chase-%26-co.-ORCRP010217-topic.html"">JPMorgan Chase</A> CEO Jamie Dimon and Iger, both of whom Trump named to his business advisory council.</P></DIV><DIV class=""trb_ar_page"" data-role=""pagination_page"" data-content-page=""2""><P>Efforts by Corporate America to influence Trump on the agreement go back at least to shortly after the election, when hundreds of large and small companies, ranging from Starbucks to Monsanto, signed a letter in support of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement. &quot;Failure to build a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy puts American prosperity at risk,&quot; the letter said, calling the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement a &quot;historic opportunity to tackle <mark>climate change</mark>.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The move even motivated Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein to send his <A href=""http://thehill.com/policy/finance/336013-goldman-sachs-ceo-rips-trumps-paris-decision-with-first-tweet"">very first tweet</A>. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, and Robert Iger, CEO of Disney, <A href=""http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-elon-musk-<mark>climate</mark>-change-20170601-story.html"">both said</A> that they would leave the president’s advisory council of CEOs due to this issue.

Instead, they need to be protected from themselves, from change and from international competition. That is not the American business community I have become familiar with.</P><H3>U.S. Businesses Want to Act on <mark>Climate Change</mark></H3><P>It is worth briefly revisiting three simple yet powerful reasons why businesses support action on <mark>climate change</mark>:</P><OL><LI>It reduces the <A href=""https://riskybusiness.org/report/national/"">massive risk</A> of droughts, floods and other extreme weather events wreaking havoc on corporate assets, customers and the economy. </LI><LI>Cutting emissions usually goes hand-in-hand with efficiency and <A href=""http://fortune.com/2015/09/28/<mark>carbon</mark>-emissions-seimens-dell/"">cost savings</A>. </LI><LI>The low <mark>carbon</mark> economy is a, if not the, <A href=""http://ifcext.ifc.org/ifcext/Pressroom/IFCPressRoom.nsf/0/BDD8E660E454DDD785258064004B4814?OpenDocument"">growth market of the future</A>.  </LI></OL><DIV class=""image""><P>Solar energy is part of the low <mark>carbon</mark> economy American businesses are eager to join. Flickr/Pieter Morlion</P></DIV><H3>How the Trump Administration Decision Hurts Businesses</H3><P>Withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement is a missed opportunity to provide predictability into the future, consistency across markets, an even playing field and an opportunity to ensure the rules of the game are practical—all things that businesses typically need. Businesses will be the first to acknowledge that without regulatory and legal measures in place, commerce at scale is not possible. Many companies can and want to invest in new business models, in change and even in <A href=""http://www.wri.org/blog/2017/05/business-what-transformative-change"">transformation</A>. The absence of predictability in government policy makes that a much riskier proposition.</P><P>This decision may hurt companies in global markets, not just American ones, as it reduces predictability and consistency across markets, and few large companies in the world are not part of a global supply chain. Still, American companies will be hardest hit. The international community will move forward with regular negotiations on how to address <mark>climate change</mark>, but the U.S. negotiators will no longer be at the table.</P><P>Additionally, <mark>climate</mark> positions are not negotiated and acted on in isolation of other issues, such as trade.. Until recently, U.S. companies could walk into procurement negotiations with business customers in other countries, bringing with them a burnished reputation on environment. That reputation is now tarnished.</P><P>Lastly, by not fostering clean technology <mark>innovation</mark>, the Trump administration is <A href=""https://www.vox.com/world/2017/6/3/15729424/trump-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-china"">allowing China to take the lead</A> in capturing the growth market of the future.</P><H3>The Road Ahead</H3><P>I am confident many American businesses will continue their current paths of action, which include <A href=""http://www.wri.org/blog/2017/05/6-graphics-show-how-us-utilities-are-turning-corporate-demand-renewables-growth"">driving demand for renewable energy</A> and <A href=""http://sciencebasedtargets.org/"">setting ambitious emissions reductions targets</A>. None of the compelling reasons for action have gone away (cost, risk and opportunity). Companies will move forward because global markets will continue to shift toward low <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>If anything, we may see companies double down to compensate and ensure they have their share of a future low-<mark>carbon</mark> marketplace. I hope that businesses will continue pushing for supportive policies in the United States, directly with government, through trade associations and in partnership with NGOs.

Ecosystem service valuation methods may help businesses better understand the financial impacts of water shortages and identify solutions. At The <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> Company’s facility in Freeport, TX, we used natural capital asset valuation to assess the risk from future changes in industrial water supplies. We found that the value of industrial water rights may increase in the future with increased demand but that potential decreases in reliability of water rights due to demand growth and <mark>climate change</mark> could reduce their value. Using this information, experts identified 16 potential nature-based and collaborative (involving other water users) solutions to future water scarcity. We used multi-criteria analysis to select five of the 16 solutions for further analysis. Two solutions (marsh wastewater treatment, land management) were not cost-competitive and three solutions (reservoir flood pool reallocation/floodplain restoration, irrigation efficiency, municipal rebate program) were cost-competitive with the business-as-usual solution (expanding reservoir storage). However, these solutions have significant technical, legal, and political hurdles. We also found that these solutions provide substantial collective benefits to the public and biodiversity, suggesting that such solutions may be appropriate for implementation via multi-stakeholder collaboration.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><UL class=""issue-navigation"" id=""issue-navigation""><LI class=""previous""><BUTTON class=""button-alternative button-alternative-tertiary"" disabled="""" type=""button""><SPAN class=""button-alternative-text""><SPAN><STRONG>Previous </STRONG>article<SPAN class=""extra-detail""> in issue</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></BUTTON></LI></UL></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

class=""submission__excerpt entry-summary""><P>The <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> Company employs a multifold sustainability strategy to reduce its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. </P></DIV></HEADER><DIV class=""submission__content entry-content""><P>In the United States, the chemical industry is the second largest industrial consumer of energy exceeded only by the petrochemical industry<SUP>1</SUP>.  Accordingly, the continued threat of <mark>climate change</mark> and subsequent increasing regulatory pressures poses a threat to corporations in this industry, including <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> Company.  Regulatory requirements are driven by the necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions produced from the use of fossil-fuels among other causes.  As governments pledge to reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, companies such as Dow that rely upon fossil-<mark>carbon</mark> feedstocks will be required to adapt at the manufacturing and business operation levels<SUP>2</SUP>.</P><P><STRONG>Sustainability Strategies</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG></P><P><EM>Clean Energy</EM></P><P>Dow recognizes that limits on greenhouse gas emissions will require investment in modifying greenhouse gas emitting equipment<SUP>3</SUP>.  Additionally, regulations will affect taxes related to emissions<SUP>3</SUP>.  As Dow’s primary source of greenhouse gas emissions are a result of energy usage, they have commissioned projects aimed at reducing dependence on fossil-fuels in order to mitigate relevant costs such as <mark>carbon</mark> taxes and cap and trade systems<SUP>3</SUP>.  For example, Dow has committed to using 400 MW of clean energy by 2025<SUP>4</SUP>.  In order to achieve this goal, Dow has launched a variety of programs, including efforts aimed at using energy generated from eucalyptus biomass and sugarcane as clean energy alternatives for their production processes<SUP>3</SUP>.</P><P><EM>Manufacturing</EM></P><P>In order to remain competitive in the face of increasing regulatory pressures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels, Dow also relies upon innovative manufacturing processes.  Advanced control and optimization models allow Dow to monitor plant conditions and adjust inputs to achieve greater efficiency<SUP>5</SUP>.  This initiative resulted in decreased energy intensity by 4 to 6 percent in 2009<SUP>5</SUP>.  Dow also uses innovative catalysts which improve the yield of raw materials to finished goods during their production processes and results in a lower energy usage<SUP>5</SUP>.</P><P><EM>Financial Planning</EM></P><P>In order to fully mitigate risk and incentivize projects that carry a lower <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, Dow has changed its business planning processes as well<SUP>3</SUP>.  When assessing potential capital investments, the price of <mark>carbon</mark> is included in Dow’s calculations and therefore influences the attractiveness of a potential project<SUP>3</SUP>.</P><P><EM>Infrastructure</EM></P><P>In addition to adapting their financial valuation processes, Dow has also implemented changes in its infrastructure to mitigate the risks that physical manifestations of global warming present<SUP>3</SUP>.  Several of Dow’s manufacturing facilities key to their supply chain are located in the Gulf region, which may be susceptible to increasingly severe weather patterns caused by global warming<SUP>3</SUP>.  Consequently, Dow has taken preventative measures and engineered facilities to better handle these types of situations<SUP>3</SUP>.</P><P><STRONG>Opportunities</STRONG></P><P>Although Dow will likely be required to allocate capital towards adapting key components of their business model in order to survive in a world in which global warming represents a significant threat, the situation presents opportunities as well.  Many of Dow’s product offerings provide both at-home and industrial consumers methods to reduce energy usage and improve <mark>carbon</mark> footprints.  For example, Dow’s STYROFOAM<SUP>TM</SUP> insulation saves consumers $10 billion in energy costs each year<SUP>3</SUP>.  In addition, Dow’s BETAMATE<SUP>TM</SUP> product, which is used in the steel industry, has resulted in a reduction of 23 million metric tons in <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions<SUP>3</SUP>.</P><P><STRONG>Potential Future Strategies</STRONG></P><P>In order to further mitigate the risks caused by global warming and its related regulations and promote adoption of clean energy sources, Dow should consider additional strategies.  In particular, there is significant opportunity in expanding research on how non-<mark>carbon</mark> raw materials may be substituted for <mark>carbon</mark> materials in the synthesis of Dow’s chemical products.  Not only would such improved processes reduce Dow’s <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, it may also have the added benefit of reducing manufacturing costs.  Additionally, improving energy efficiency through reusing energy at key points in the production process would reduce the extent of Dow’s dependency on fossil fuels.  For example, recapturing energy units from heat sources could be applied to drive other processes.  Finally, <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage in mines or other subterranean locations may be a potential method to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions<SUP>6</SUP>.</P><P><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></P><P>Although Dow is heavily dependent on fossil fuels, its efforts to reduce its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint are noteworthy.  They are managing this issue through a multifold strategy, and represent a good model for others in the chemicals industry hoping to abate their contribution to global warming.</P><P> </P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

	Dow is making sure our business strategy is integrated to address not only the financial but the environmental and social aspects of our activity, and the value we bring to each of those sectors.
	Sales are assessed each year using a process which looks at not only the footprint from producing the product, but the positive and negative impacts it has throughout the value chain. We do that trying to maximize the positives and minimize the unintended consequences. <STRONG>Q: What was the process Dow went through to make sustainability part of the culture?</STRONG>
	Our transformation has been to evolve sustainability from a concept about making products and having a societal right to operate, to actually integrating it into a business strategy. That involves aligning the company with key megatrends going on in the world that we think we can have an impact on, whether that's <mark>sustainable</mark> energy, improving water and transportation infrastructure, or addressing human health. Dow can play in those markets. Getting that mindset in our business strategy has been the key thing.
	Our 1995 to 2005 goals were really based on defining our footprint and improving our operations around energy efficiency, emissions, and safety. That has been embedded in the company’s culture. It didn’t take too much effort for a very process- and metric-driven organization. We set company commitments and measure people by that. Our goals from 2005 to 2015 involve sustainability as value added. Integrating that into our business is more challenging. 
	The company has key sustainability performance indicators that we expect every business to measure themselves against, the same way we do financial measurements. Fundamentally, we had to systematize it. We had to get to the point where the corporation doesn't just talk about it, we measure it. 
	Then we had to bring in the enablement aspect of working it through the programs. And we've developed that in terms of our alignment on our R&amp;D investments and structure. It’s a transformational program to get through. We have to build off of our past successes. <STRONG>Q: Considering the chemical industry as a whole, what role does the industry have in shaping what sustainability means around the world?</STRONG>
	I think the chemical industry is a key player in this because more than 95% of everything manufactured has chemistry in the value chain, so we have a very good view of almost every industry. We're in agriculture, transportation, infrastructure, electronics, clothing, and housing. We’re in almost every aspect of human progress. <STRONG>Q: What has the industry done well to this point and where are the key challenges?</STRONG>
	The chemical industry has done very well in being transparent in its operations and performance. We have been looking at new ways to reduce waste and manage our footprint. Transparency has been key to recognizing that the products have to be designed to more <mark>sustainable</mark> attributes. <STRONG>Q: You're both the CSO and the CIO for Dow. Can you explain the management and the strategic challenges that you face, balancing transparency and needing to protect proprietary information?</STRONG>
	Some things are competitive in terms of what we patent, but our footprint and how we manage our plants and our relationships are becoming more transparent. The reality is that a business should be able to report environmental and community impact along with economic activity. We ought to be very transparent on the triple bottom line. We don't have to give away competitive information on how we develop products to be transparent about our output impact on those three dimensions. 
	In fact, in many cases, as we go into new markets, we share that knowledge. It's capacity building. We want to participate in an industry that behaves with the same standards that we do. As we've gone into places like China, as an example, we helped their environmental agencies to develop programs with companies to understand that reducing waste is economically viable, even economically beneficial. We also share our best practices around chemical safety in a program with their Ministry of Environmental Protection and UNEP.<STRONG>Q: How does Dow approach transparency around legacy issues with environmental problems?</STRONG>
	The company is 113 years old. We've learned a lot in that time. Clearly, over the years, we have areas that we've tried to address. We try to be transparent on what our strategy and position are, and how we're working to resolution if they haven't been resolved. You can go to our website and look at them. They're posted along with the positive things we're doing. We don’t hide them. In many cases we sit down and talk to people about them because open dialogue is where you work through issues.<STRONG>Q: There was a period of time when clashes between environmental groups and business led to opposing stances. How has the company’s culture changed over time with respect to environmental issues?</STRONG>
	We're a science and technology company. We were the first company to have an industrial toxicology group. The chemical industry is energy intensive because it takes fundamental building blocks and applies energy to transform them into valuable products. So we've had a &quot;war on wasted BTUs,&quot; wasted energy, since 1968. That became our lens on the issue for a time.
	What we learned in the 1970s and 1980s is that we had to listen to others in order to establish a common view. This is one of the areas where Dow has grown. In 1992 we started a corporate advisory panel on the environment. We continue to have that today, with NGOs, people from academia, and ex-government officials from the EPA and other areas. 
	Companies are announcing similar panels now, but we realized a long time ago that it was important for Dow to get input. We’ve learned to work in collaboration. We're not necessarily always going to have the same view as to how to solve a problem, but if we work together we can usually find some common ground that will let us continue to move forward. 
	The USCAP program—the United States <mark>Climate</mark> Action Partnership—which includes several companies, including Dow, and key NGOs, is a good example of collaboration to shape policies that address energy and <mark>climate change</mark> issues.<STRONG>Q: How does sustainability show up in operational processes?</STRONG>
	For many decades Dow has had an approach that waste reduction always pays. We try to reuse every waste stream that comes from a plant. If you have wastewater from one plant, you can use it as an input into another plant. On our large sites, that's really the nature of Dow’s integration. A lot of our products generate hydrogen. In the old days, you'd see flares for that, because nobody saw a use for it. Now we take that hydrogen and bring it back into the plant as energy. In other words, we look at every waste product and figure out how to completely eliminate it, reuse it, or treat it to manage it effectively. The goal is always to keep a molecule in play by driving integration.<STRONG>Q: How has research and thinking about green chemistry been implemented at Dow?</STRONG>
	When the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry were published, Dow embraced them pretty early. We brought it into the company through a concept that today we call &quot;<mark>sustainable</mark> chemistry,&quot; which uses the principles of green chemistry while also looking at a total life cycle and social dimensions. Obviously each product has to be cost-advantaged to produce and value-added to sell. We have taken all our products through a <mark>sustainable</mark> chemistry index, which includes some traditional attributes, in terms of the safety to manufacture and transport the product and efficiency of implementation. But it also looks at the value it adds to society. Are we deriving it from renewable resources? How does it compare to our other products? We then provide feedback to businesses on their opportunities. Which reinforces our focus on integrating sustainability into business strategy.</P></DIV></SECTION></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Factory smokestacks, once seen as icons of industrial progress, are now viewed with the same concern as a smoking tailpipe. <mark>Climate change</mark> has fueled an onslaught of droughts, floods and fires that have buffeted the world, killing tens of thousands and causing billions of dollars in damage. Some island nations like the Maldives are fated to see their countries swallowed by the sea. The Global Humanitarian Forum holds <mark>climate change</mark> directly responsible for 300,000 deaths a year - a figure that may need to be ratcheted upwards now that scientists have linked <mark>climate change</mark> to the increasing frequency of deadly volcanoes, earthquakes and landslides.
While an increase of 2 degrees Celsius could cause the extinction of millions of species, <mark>climate change</mark> is already threatening food yields and the livelihoods of peasant farmers around the globe. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warns that a global temperature increase of two-to-four degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels could reduce crops yields 15-35 percent in Africa and Asia and 25-35 percent across the Middle East. When most of us think about the root causes of global warming, we think of companies like Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda, Chevron and ExxonMobil. But the problem isn't just one of cars and smokestacks; it's also a problem of cows and cornstalks. While governments, the media and even the some <mark>climate</mark> activists tend to focus on industry and automobiles to rein in <mark>pollution</mark>, the largest single factor stoking global warming may be the industrial food system.
Powerful corporations like Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill, Dean Foods, Dow AgroSciences, Monsanto and Tyson share a major - though largely overlooked - role in fueling <mark>climate change</mark>. These giant multinationals have seized control over much of the planet's food resources, dominating the growing, processing and sales of meat, grains and oils. ADM and Cargill now control 65% of the world's trade in grain. Monsanto and Syngenta control 20% of the $60-billion market in bio-engineered seeds. The corporate campaign to &quot;patent nature&quot; and control the world's food supply has been so successful that today, 85% of US corn is genetically engineered.
Agriculture - at least the high-input, chemical-dependent, fossil-fueled system favored by the Agribusiness giants - has become a major part of the <mark>climate</mark> crisis. In addition to producing food and fiber, agriculture produces a harvest of three major greenhouse gasses (GHGs) - <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4). <mark>Carbon</mark> dioxide is produced when fossil fuels are burned for energy and transportation and in the production of chemical pesticides and artificial fertilizers. Fertilizer manufacturing emits around 41 million metric tons of <mark>CO2</mark> a year. Up to 60 percent of human-caused nitrous oxide (which has 296 times the Global Warming Potential of <mark>CO2</mark>) is released largely by the use of chemical fertilizers. Fifty percent of methane (with 25 times the GWP of <mark>CO2</mark>) is produced by industrial livestock operations. The impact is compounded by a global trade structure that was created to turn farming from a local enterprise into a planet-sized business.
Soils contain vast stockpiles of <mark>carbon</mark> in the form of organic matter. Industrial agriculture's practice of plowing the land for immediate gain rather than long-term sustainability releases land-stored <mark>carbon</mark> into the atmosphere, exacerbating <mark>climate change</mark>. According to varying estimates, oil-dependent farming, livestock operations, destruction of <mark>carbon</mark>-storing fields and forests to accommodate farming, the use of chemical fertilizers and the combustion of fuel to process and distribute food all add up to between one-fifth and one-half of the human-caused <mark>pollution</mark> that is driving <mark>climate change</mark>.
The Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) has warned that, in order to avoid a <mark>climate</mark> calamity, the world's industrialized nations must cut GHG emissions 25-40% below 1990 levels by 2050. The G-77 countries and the People's <mark>Climate</mark> Declaration have called for cutting emissions by at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2020 but neither pending US legislation nor the non-binding Accord signed at the end of the Copenhagen <mark>Climate</mark> Summit comes anywhere close to meeting this goal.
The industrialized nations are responsible for 7 of every 10 tons of <mark>CO2</mark> emitted since the dawn of the Industrial Era - with much of that stemming from the conversion of land to large-scale commercial farming and the growth of energy- and chemical-intensive industrial agriculture. So far, the response of most of the industrialized world has been to insist that the solutions to world hunger and <mark>climate change</mark> lie in &quot;more of the same&quot; - agrofuels, genetically engineered &quot;<mark>climate</mark>-ready&quot; seeds, nuclear power, the Global Marketplace and &quot;cap-and-trade&quot; <mark>pollution</mark>-trading schemes. At the same time, the World Bank continues to increase its lending to fossil fuel projects around the world (up 165% in FY2008).
Fortunately, evidence is mounting that much of the damage done by industrial farming can be undone by small, local, organic farming. &quot;If we can change the way we farm and the way we produce and distribute food,&quot; a report from GRAIN concludes, &quot;then we have a powerful solution for combating the <mark>climate</mark> crisis.&quot; </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Munich Re reported that it was the third-costliest year on record behind 2011 and 2005. Many of the most costly events occurred in the United States, including the <mark>devastation</mark> caused by Superstorm Sandy and the widespread, prolonged drought in the Midwest. Companies and their stakeholders—governments, employees, communities and customers—are increasingly concerned about the costs associated with more frequent and intense floods, droughts, hurricanes and wildfires. Many companies are taking steps to begin to enhance their resilience to these growing risks. However, companies traditionally have planned based on past weather events, and few have attempted to integrate the increasing risks associated with the changing <mark>climate</mark> into their planning and operations. Initial efforts to do so suggest that barriers and uncertainties often stand in the way, preventing companies from achieving resilience against the rising risks of <mark>climate change</mark> impacts.</P><P>This report, <EM>Weathering the Storm</EM>, provides an in-depth look at the ways multinational companies are beginning to assess and address the risks of extreme weather and other <mark>climate change</mark> impacts. The companies examined play strategic roles in the global economy in a wide range of sectors including banking and financial services, consumer goods, healthcare, information communications, manufacturing, and materials. The report is based on two complementary lines of research:</P><UL><LI>A comprehensive review of the perspectives and activities of companies listed in the Standard and Poor’s (S&amp;P) Global 100 Index, based on their reporting to the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project and in their corporate sustainability reports and annual financial filings; and</LI><LI>In-depth case studies of the practices and experiences of six companies in diverse sectors: American Water, Bayer, The Hartford Group, National Grid, Rio Tinto and Weyerhaeuser.</LI></UL><P>Together, these sources provide a detailed snapshot of the state of resilience planning among a cross-section of global companies: how they perceive and talk publicly about their <mark>climate</mark>-related risks, the steps they are taking or planning to take, and the barriers that stand in their way. The research in this report also establishes a baseline that can be used to monitor risk management activities related to <mark>climate</mark> impacts over time.</P><P>Broadly speaking, the research reveals that while the vast majority of companies recognize risks from extreme weather and <mark>climate change</mark>, and many see these risks in the present or near term, uncertainty about the precise nature, timing and severity of <mark>climate</mark> impacts often inhibits investment in resilience beyond “business as usual.” A few leading companies are taking steps to address <mark>climate</mark> risks where they see significant opportunities to become more efficient, reduce costs, or provide greater value to customers—in other words, where there is a clear business case to do so. By and large, however, the business response thus far is largely a continuation of existing practices based on a historical picture of past risks, and often fails to adequately consider changing <mark>climate</mark> and weather conditions. Thus, the most common strategy for addressing <mark>climate</mark>-related risks leaves most companies without the resilience they need to weather future physical impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Beyond these broad conclusions, the report outlines a set of more detailed findings on prevailing attitudes and practices among S&amp;P Global 100 companies. And, to help encourage and inform stronger resilience efforts, it lays out a four-step framework for managing <mark>climate</mark> risks that incorporates the emerging best practices from case-study companies already working to prepare for the very likely prospect of increasing extreme weather and <mark>climate change</mark> impacts.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Sir Richard Branson and other leaders explained their strategy at the DS Virgin <mark>Innovation</mark> Summit.</SPAN><DIV class=""article-body kapost-article-body""><P><STRONG>The bad news:</STRONG> On June 1, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the <SPAN>Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Accord</SPAN>. That agreement is the world’s handshake deal to limit the global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius (the threshold for avoiding dangerous global warming, according to <mark>climate</mark> scientists), beginning in 2020.</P><P><STRONG>The good news</STRONG>: The federal government’s abandonment of core environmental principles has given businesses and local governments an opportunity to shine. Thousands of cities, states, and private corporations have pledged to <A href=""http://wearestillin.com/"" target=""_blank"">meet or exceed the goals of the Paris Accord</A>. In addition, companies such as Starbucks, Walmart, and Johnson &amp; Johnson have committed to sourcing 100 percent of their energy from renewable resources.</P><P><STRONG>The great news</STRONG>: Big business is becoming better business. As the federal government retreats from the global effort to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark>, many big corporations are digging in to find solutions.</P><P>In mid-July, corporate and nonprofit leaders gathered in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, which is being transformed into an <mark>innovation</mark> hub by New Lab, to discuss how the private sector can help address <mark>climate change</mark>. Speakers and panelists included Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson, <SPAN><mark>Dow Chemical</mark></SPAN> CEO Andrew Liveris, <SPAN>Rocky Mountain Institute</SPAN> Managing Director Jon Creyts, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Chief Sustainability Officer Lara Birkes.</P><P>These organizations are already working to address <mark>climate change</mark> issues, with plenty of accomplishments to demonstrate their commitment. Your business can take inspiration from their leadership.</P><P>The DS Virgin <mark>Innovation</mark> Summit was held in the <A href=""http://newlab.com/"" target=""_blank"">New Lab</A> space in Brooklyn, New York in mid-July. The former naval shipyard has been converted to a headquarters for “ambitious vertices of technology, robotics, and nanotech,” said New Lab co-founder David Belt. The one-year-old <SPAN>New Lab</SPAN> is the home to <SPAN>over 95</SPAN> funded companies with a focus <SPAN>on advanced technologies including</SPAN> machine learning and artificial intelligence and is aligned with the Summit’s can-do spirit.</P><H3>Think outside the factory</H3><P>Businesses are used to thinking in terms of “how can we spend less” and “how can we earn more?” The same premise applies to energy usage and costs: use fewer resources and be efficient in energy consumption.</P><P>For example, the <SPAN>Empire State Building now saves 40 percent on its energy bill</SPAN>, thanks to the Rocky Mountain Institute’s 2010 retrofit. According to Creyts, the institute worked on site to re-manufacture 6,500 windows into super-windows that block heat but let through light.</P><P>Another example: HPE plans to acquire 50 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025, with a long term goal of sourcing 100 percent renewable, according to Birkes. HPE has also committed to reduce manufacturing-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in its supply chain by 15 percent, aiming to avoid 100 million tons of emissions by enabling its suppliers to set robust GHG reduction commitments. These reductions are equivalent to taking 21 million cars off the road for an entire year.</P><P>Businesses are also looking to improve technology to reduce their energy footprint. Industrial motors use 30 percent of the world’s electricity, according to Creyts. Improved design and management can shave 20 to 40 percent off that usage, and so-called integrated design can make the motors even more efficient. In other words, instead of improving the design of pumps and motors, industry needs to improve the efficiency of how the hardware is connected.</P><P>This isn’t theory. By replacing long and thin and crooked pipes with short and fat and straight ones, Rocky Mountain Institute technologists have reduced energy consumption by 86 percent. “Applying similar approaches worldwide can displace half of coal-fired electricity globally,” Creyts claimed. </P><P>Illinois-based energy company LanzaTech uses bacteria to ferment industrial gas emissions, such as <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide, into ethanol. During her NewLab presentation, LanzaTech CEO Jennifer Holmgren explained that the company converts emissions from steel mills, refineries, and ferro alloy plants before they become <mark>pollution</mark>. &quot;<mark>Carbon</mark> emissions can become a feedstock of the future,&quot; Holmgren said.  </P><H3>Virtuous competition</H3><P>How about enlightened self-interest fueled by just a touch of greed? When it comes to green technology, competition can bring out the best in people.</P><P>For example, the <SPAN>Virgin Earth Challenge</SPAN> will pay you a $25 million prize if your technology can remove (or is capable of removing) greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, specifically 1 billion tons of <mark>carbon</mark>-equivalent per year for at least 10 years.</P><P>The competition came about 10 years ago, said Branson, after a conversation with Al Gore about <mark>climate change</mark>. “My wife said, ‘Why, there must be a way of taking the <mark>carbon</mark> out of the Earth’s atmosphere. Surely that will solve the problem?’ So we put up a $25 million prize.” The prize is still up for grabs, but <SPAN>several finalists</SPAN> are vying for the win.</P><P>Birkes pointed to HPE's <SPAN>Living Progress Challenge</SPAN>, which invited the global community to solve social problems, such as education and healthcare, with software and digital services. HPE awarded the winners not only by handing them $1,000 but also by developing their ideas into functioning digital applications. One of last year’s winners, the World Wildlife Fund, won with its app <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkToDf0a1xk"" target=""_blank"">Detect IT: Fish</A>, “which uses custom data flow to track illegal fisheries,” said Birkes. This app has the potential to <SPAN>reduce illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing</SPAN> by 50 percent by 2020. “As a nice scalable example, we can replicate this for endangered species or ivory [with] data technology,” Birkes said.</P><H3>Rethinking transportation</H3><P>Businesses operate in a world that is demanding greener products and solutions. Nowhere is that more evident than in the technology of transportation.</P><P>Liveris noted that despite the name, <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> is a material sciences company. He described how Dow is creating “structural pieces that take out lots of weight from cars.” Lighter cars, of course, require less energy to move. Dow’s biggest automotive customer? Tesla.</P><P>According to Holmgren, the aviation industry has made a commitment to achieve <mark>carbon</mark> neutrality, that is, either by removing as much <mark>carbon</mark> in the air as it puts in or by offsetting its <mark>carbon</mark> output by planting trees. “By 2050, there’s an expectation that [the aviation industry, i.e., the producers and operators of airplanes] will reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> footprint by 50 percent relative to 2005,” Holmgren said. Working with Virgin and other airlines, LanzaTech is turning waste from aluminum and steel plants into ethanol, which ultimately will be converted into jet aviation fuel. </P><P>The DS Virgin Racing Summit was a pit stop for Branson and his team before heading over to cheer on the DS Virgin Racing Formula E team, which was competing in a race in Brooklyn. Formula E is a racing circuit for electric vehicles, designed to popularize electric vehicles and serve as a springboard for ideas to improve their technology.</P><P>It’s working. After three Formula E seasons, Renault has already adapted technology developed for its Formula E cars in consumer vehicles. According to Virgin Racing CEO Alex Tai, “Some companies have already adapted parts into their road cars, such as parts of <SPAN>the powertrain that they used in season 1</SPAN>.”</P><H3>Dollars and cents</H3><P>Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, said that energy-saving and efficient technology has had a revolution in the past 15 years “because of a virtuous blend of science, and a little bit of policy, and a lot of great technology.” But in order to solve the puzzle that is global warming, the world also needs support from the financial industry.</P><P>“We’re trying to move philanthropy to put their money where their mouth is,” Tamminen said. His foundation is asking endowments and other investors to allocate capital for <mark>sustainable</mark> development, renewable resources, and conservation. To that end, the foundation launched a $1 billion Planet Pledge Fund. Its goal is to create an opportunity for investors “to make more money on a risk-adjusted basis while helping the planet.”</P><P>Branson concurred. “The money to be invested in this area is critical,” he said. Branson, Bono, and several others founded <A href=""http://therisefund.com/"" target=""_blank"">the Rise Fund</A> to invest in critical sectors like energy and agriculture where there are opportunities to make a positive social and environmental impact. Although the Rise Fund has raised nearly $2 billion in the past few months, Branson said it needs $2 trillion to meet its goal of achieving measurable global impact by 2027.</P><P>“What we’ve somehow got to do is get the pension world to switch billions and billions of their moneys into this area to really get on top of [our goals],&quot; Branson said.  &quot;As the technologists are coming up with the breakthroughs, hopefully we can attract more and more money in this area.”</P><P>Watch the entire event:</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Instead, it advances a set of loose and voluntary norms for getting to the final goal. In 2015, every country announced a (nonbinding) plan in which they promised to (eventually) slow down pumping <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. <A href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/12/a-readers-guide-to-the-paris-agreement/420345/"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'528456'"">In 2018, and every five years afterward</A>, all the countries will get together again and announce new promises.</P><P>This looseness was intentional. The accord’s architects hoped to nudge everyone into bringing down their emissions together—but they didn’t (and couldn’t)<EM> force</EM>any one nation to do it. More pointedly, they also could not compel a Republican-controlled U.S. Senate to ratify any binding international <mark>climate</mark> treaty. So Paris trades in signals, not sacrifice; unanimous resolutions, not top-down restrictions. John Kerry <A href=""http://2009-2017.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/12/250584.htm"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'528456'"">said during negotiations</A> that it sends “literally a critical message to the global marketplace.” In truth, this is pretty much the only thing it does.</P><P>The Paris deal worked as long as Barack Obama was president, and it would probably have worked under a President Hillary Clinton, too. Some senior U.S. official would attend the meeting every year to clamor about the document’s importance, and investors would get the message and plunge more money into renewable-energy infrastructure and research.</P><P>President Trump, however, has speculated about leaving the treaty since its completion. If he stays in the treaty, he will do so only begrudgingly. That’s why some <mark>climate</mark> leaders are now wondering: Will the Paris agreement be stronger without the United States—at least as long as its president doubts <mark>climate change</mark>?</P></SECTION></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""blah""><DIV class=""l-article__container__container""><SECTION class=""l-article__section s-cms-content"" itemprop=""articleBody"" id=""article-section-1""><P>Luke Kemp, a political scientist at Australian National University who has attended many <mark>climate</mark> negotiations, <A href=""https://theconversation.com/the-world-would-be-better-off-if-trump-withdraws-from-the-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-78096"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'528456'"">gets to the point</A> in pithy piece at <EM>The Conversation</EM>: “Money and emissions are all that matter.” (He made the same argument <A href=""https://www.nature.com/n<mark>climate</mark>/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/n<mark>climate</mark>3309.html"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'528456'"">in a paper in </A><EM><A href=""https://www.nature.com/n<mark>climate</mark>/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/n<mark>climate</mark>3309.html"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'528456'"">Nature <mark>Climate Change</mark></A></EM>last week.)</P><P>Neither money nor emissions will change if the United States is actually a member of the Paris treaty, he says. The accords don’t require the U.S. to commit money to <A href=""http://www.green<mark>climate</mark>.fund/home"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'528456'"">the Green <mark>Climate</mark> Fund</A>, a UN pool meant to help developing countries prepare for the consequences of global warming. Under Trump, it won’t.</P><P>More importantly, the agreement also won’t change how much heat-trapping gas escapes from American smoke stacks, tail pipes, or farm land. Trump has already begun to weaken many of the domestic programs—such <A href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/trump-<mark>climate</mark>-eo/520986/"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'528456'"">as Obama’s Clean Power Plan</A> for the electricity sector, and <A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-change-epa-cafe-standards-car-companies-2017-3"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'528456'"">the greenhouse-gas CAFE standards for cars</A>—that would have added teeth to America’s Paris goals. (Kemp argues that, without them, the country will “probably miss its <mark>climate</mark> target.”)</P><P>Kemp also worries about the cascading effects of having an indolent United States in treaty meetings. If America misses its global target—and nothing happens—will the momentum that sustains Paris halter and fall apart? There remain many governing details of the treaty that have yet to be finalized, too. Negotiators will spend time between now and 2020 committing them to paper. If the U.S. stays in, Rex Tillerson’s State Department will retain a veto power in these talks. Will it weaken the treaty?</P><P>Joseph Curtin, <A href=""http://www.iiea.com/staff/joseph-curtin"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'528456'"">one of Ireland’s leading <mark>climate</mark>-policy wonks</A> and a member of its official <mark>climate</mark> advisory council, <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changenews.com/2017/05/10/us-no-longer-worthy-paris-agreement/"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'528456'"">also believes</A> the United States should exit the treaty. Paris, he argues, is a “club for countries who are part of a global effort to tackle dangerous <mark>climate change</mark>.” The U.S. doesn’t make that cut anymore.</P><P>As part of his pitch, he turns one of the most familiar arguments for staying in Paris on its head: that oil and coal companies like Exxon, Shell, and Peabody Energy support U.S. involvement in the treaty. (Peabody, the largest U.S. coal company, <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/13/peabody-energy-coal-mining-<mark>climate</mark>-change-denial-funding"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'528456'"">has long lobbied</A> against any kind of <mark>climate policy</mark>, so <A href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-pact-coal-companies-236730"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'528456'"">its support for Paris</A> is a surprise.)</P><P>If all these fossil-fuel companies care about global warming, he asks, where were they when the Trump administration was <A href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/trumps-war-on-the-<mark>climate</mark>-begins/519159/"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'528456'"">weakening every meaningful domestic <mark>climate policy</mark></A>?</P><P>“The current debate is really between those who want to leave Paris and totally deny <mark>climate change</mark>, and those who see Paris as a branding and lobbying opportunity,” he says. Therefore, the U.S. should leave, so the American public can understand the true stakes of the fight:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Polling suggests that the <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/11/21/trump-wants-to-dump-the-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-but-71-percent-of-americans-support-it-survey-finds/?utm_term=.b1e1e1a04c95"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'13',r'528456'"">vast majority</A> of Americans favor staying in. Should the U.S. leave, however, the moral outrage of these constituents could be a powerful catalyst for change. There is a danger remaining in could muddy the waters and allow U.S. citizens to believe they are contributing to resolving a global problem, when the opposite is the case.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>It’s a novel argument for leaving the treaty—and one that, to be clear, remains a minority view. Almost every Congressional Democrat <A href=""https://www.axios.com/battle-lines-over-the-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-2422086847.html"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'14',r'528456'"">supports staying in Paris</A>, as do more than a dozen House or Senate Republicans.

But moves by ExxonMobil and others are fueling scrutiny of the Trump administration and its corporate influences. Norman Eisen of the Brookings Institute and The Wall Street Journal's Jay Solomon join Hari Sreenivasan to discuss how these moves are raising red flags.</P></DIV><H2 class=""vt__header"">Read the Full Transcript</H2><UL class=""video-transcript""><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>HARI SREENIVASAN:</STRONG></P><P> Now: how behind-the-scenes moves by a pair of corporate giants are raising red flags about the Trump administration.</P><P>Companies routinely advocate and lobby every day on behalf of their business and shareholders. Sometimes, those matters are not just about corporate profits, but also about the economic livelihoods of workers and communities.</P><P>But moves by ExxonMobil and <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> are fueling scrutiny about the corporate influence within the Trump administration.</P><P>April 2012, Rex Tillerson, then CEO of ExxonMobil, visits Moscow, wrapping up a deal with the Russian state oil company Rosneft. It calls for investing up to $500 billion to hunt for oil in the Arctic Ocean and Black Sea.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>REX TILLERSON, CEO, ExxonMobil:</STRONG></P><P> I would like to thank you for the warm welcome, and it is a historic day for ExxonMobil and Rosneft.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>HARI SREENIVASAN:</STRONG></P><P> But two years later, the drilling venture was blocked, when the U.S. imposed sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Now ExxonMobil is asking the Trump administration to let the Black Sea part of the project go forward.</P><P>Tillerson, in his new role as secretary of state, says he will do just as he promised during his confirmation hearing.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>REX TILLERSON:</STRONG></P><P> As to any issues involving ExxonMobil that might come before me if confirmed as secretary of state, I would recuse myself from those issues.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>HARI SREENIVASAN:</STRONG></P><P> But his past ties to ExxonMobil mean the request is certain to draw extra scrutiny. Moreover, Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election remains a hot issue in Washington.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, for one, voiced disbelief about the news yesterday. In a tweet, he asked:</STRONG></P><P> “Are they crazy?”</P><P>At the same time, <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> is asking the new administration not to impose new curbs on three widely used insecticides. They are diazinon, malathion and chlorpyrifos.</P><P>The Associated Press reports Dow and two other manufacturers want the government to set aside federal studies that found the chemicals may be harmful to about 1,800 threatened or endangered species. The companies argue the studies are fundamentally flawed. Environmental advocates say there’s no such thing as perfect lab conditions.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>BRETT HARTL, Center for Biological Diversity:</STRONG></P><P> You can’t just take an endangered fish, an endangered salmon out of the wild, take it to the lab and then expose it to enough pesticides until it dies to get that sort of data you need. It’s wrong morally. It’s illegal.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>HARI SREENIVASAN:</STRONG></P><P> The Environmental Protection Agency says only that it’s reviewing petitions as they come in, giving careful consideration to sound science and good policy-making.</P><P>As with Exxon, Dow’s influence will be an issue. The company contributed a million dollars to President Trump’s inaugural activities. And, in February, when Mr. Trump signed an executive order on rolling back regulations, Dow’s CEO was at his side.</P><P>Let’s look into some of the questions being raised about each of these examples.</P><P>Jay Solomon broke the news about ExxonMobil in The Wall Street Journal. And Norman Eisen is a former special counsel to President Obama. His expertise is government ethics. He’s now a fellow at the Brookings Institution.</P><P>Jay, let me start with you.</P><P>Why does Exxon want this?</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>JAY SOLOMON, The Wall Street Journal:</STRONG></P><P> Well, basically, the Arctic and the Black Sea are kind of one the most sought-after kind of pioneer spots for oil exploration.</P><P>And, you know, for their future earnings, for the growth of the business, this is seen as kind of one of the last great places to explore.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>HARI SREENIVASAN:</STRONG></P><P> How much money are we talking about here? How significant is this potential?</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>JAY SOLOMON:</STRONG></P><P> I mean, President Putin, when they announced the deal in 2012, said it could be as much as $500 billion in investment, and huge amounts of oil and gas is in that region.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>HARI SREENIVASAN:</STRONG></P><P> Is it typical for these types of exceptions to be asked for? Is it sometimes on humanitarian grounds or other reasons?</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>JAY SOLOMON:</STRONG></P><P> There are. If you look in Iran or Burma, as the Obama administration was kind of pursuing their policies, there were exemptions granted for humanitarian or technology reasons.</P><P>But an issue like this that is politically charged with this much money with a country like Russia, it’s pretty unusual that you would see a waiver granted in this situation.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>HARI SREENIVASAN:</STRONG></P><P> Rex Tillerson, former secretary — or former head of Exxon, now the secretary of state, he has recused himself for two years. Right?</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>JAY SOLOMON:</STRONG></P><P> Yes, he has.</P><P>I mean, ultimately, the decision on the waiver is made by an office in the Treasury Department, but because of the national security and foreign policy implications, the State Department, probably some of the intelligence agencies, it’s a broader issue.</P><P>But, obviously, when Tillerson got this job, the question was immediately asked, you know, how will your previous job impact the issue of Exxon? And it’s tricky, and already you see Republicans and Democrats saying, not just because of Tillerson, but because of the concerns about Russia’s hacking of the election and the other investigations, that this is not going to get political support.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>HARI SREENIVASAN:</STRONG></P><P> Norm Eisen, what about the idea that Rex Tillerson has said he will recuse himself for this? Isn’t that the kind of safeguard that we have in place to make sure that nothing untoward happens?</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>NORMAN EISEN, Brookings Institute:</STRONG></P><P> Well, I think it’s important that Mr. Tillerson recuse himself. And he is to be applauded for doing that and for making a complete break with Exxon.</P><P>But that doesn’t solve all the problems here. Exxon gave $500,000 to Mr. Trump’s inaugural. There’s an enormous cloud around Russia, not just the violations of national borders and sovereignty that led to these sanctions, but also the violations of our democratic norms. There can be no doubt that they interfered in the election.</P><P>The only question now is whether Mr. Trump or those around him knew of it or were involved in it. So, granting a sanctions waiver here just is not called for.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>HARI SREENIVASAN:</STRONG></P><P> Norm Eisen, I mean, a lot of times, it’s the proximity and the adjacency of facts that ends up leading us to different conclusions.</P><P>Until there is some sort of smoking gun or a trail of evidence, are we prejudging?</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>NORMAN EISEN:</STRONG></P><P> Well, I think it’s very important not to prejudge, but at the same time, it’s clear now, there’s a consensus, an intelligence community consensus.</P><P>We have just seen documents from a government think tank in Russia demonstrating an interference in our elections, what we can describe as an act of gray war by doing this. It’s an extraordinary hostility against the United States. And there’s substantial indications that there have been contacts by those who were in and around Mr. Trump.</P><P>There’s very substantial evidence that raises serious questions here, and that goes to the political <mark>climate</mark> for this sanctions waiver. I don’t think it’s going to be granted.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>HARI SREENIVASAN:</STRONG></P><P> Jay Solomon, you mentioned this a little bit, the political <mark>climate</mark> here. What kind of support or lack of support is there when you have, say, Senator McCain tweeting, “Are you crazy?” in the case of Exxon?</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>JAY SOLOMON:</STRONG></P><P> No, I think it’s tough.</P><P>I think Exxon’s argument is, you know, we have to basically start drilling by the end of this year, or we’re going to lose this concession, and if we don’t get it, the European companies that are already starting to mobilize in this area, they have been granted some waivers from the European Union to pursue this. So, you know, if we don’t get, it’s going to be developed, you know, anyway, and then American jobs and money is going to be hurt.</P><P>That’s what they’re going to argue. But I also agree, it’s going to be very difficult to gin up political support in an environment where Russia, whether it’s the hacking or the accusations of collusion or Ukraine, it’s just they have not given President Trump anything to work with either, the Russians.</P><P>So, I agree. I think it would be very difficult for the Trump administration to get political support.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>HARI SREENIVASAN:</STRONG></P><P> Norm Eisen, do you have different concerns about the issues with Dow?</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>NORMAN EISEN:</STRONG></P><P> Well, mercifully, Dow is not accused of any improper assault on our democracy.</P><P>But we do have an even larger political contribution to the Trump inauguration, $1 million from Dow. You have the Dow CEO, who is seen at Mr. Trump’s side. He has extraordinary access in the White House, chairs a group that advises Mr. Trump, was there when Mr. Trump signed his executive order relating to cutting back regulation.</P><P>And now you have Dow’s request to set aside the science — the U.S. government has made scientific findings about these organophosphates and the harms they cause to — set aside that science and relieve regulation. It doesn’t smell right.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>HARI SREENIVASAN:</STRONG></P><P> Norm Eisen, how different is this from the revolving door that people so hate about Washington, that people come right out of government, go right into the private sector, and then oftentimes right back in if the administration changes?</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>NORMAN EISEN:</STRONG></P><P> Well, the problem with the Trump White House is that they removed the revolving door and just threw it open, and it’s being flooded with corporate executives who are coming in with lobbyists.</P><P>They removed the lobbying ban that President Obama had in his ethics executive order. And everybody believes that business has to have a seat at the table, has to be on a level table, though. The problem is, it appears that the table is tilted to disproportionately favor business as a special interest, beyond the public interest, and so that is worrying. It’s in a way worse than the revolving door.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>HARI SREENIVASAN:</STRONG></P><P> All right, Norm Eisen of the Brookings Institution and Jay Solomon from The Wall Street Journal, thank you both.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>JAY SOLOMON:</STRONG></P></DIV></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Watching the raft of newly elected GOP lawmakers converge on Washington, I couldn't help thinking about an issue I hope our party will better address. I call on my fellow Republicans to open their minds to rethinking what has largely become our party's line: denying that <mark>climate change</mark> and global warming are occurring and that they are largely due to human activities.
</P><DIV id=""body_after_content_column""><P>
National Journal reported last month that 19 of the 20 serious <A href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/columns/political-connections/gop-gives-<mark>climate</mark>-science-a-cold-shoulder-20101008"" target="""">GOP Senate challengers declared that the science of <mark>climate change</mark> is either inconclusive or flat-out wrong</A>. Many newly elected Republican House members take that position. It is a stance that defies the findings of our country's National Academy of Sciences, national scientific academies from around the world and 97 percent of the world's <mark>climate</mark> scientists.
</P><P>
Why do so many Republican senators and representatives think they are right and the world's top scientific academies and scientists are wrong? I would like to be able to chalk it up to lack of information or misinformation.
</P><P>
I can understand arguments over proposed policy approaches to <mark>climate change</mark>. I served in Congress for 24 years. I know these are legitimate areas for debate. What I find incomprehensible is the dogged determination by some to discredit distinguished scientists and their findings.
</P><P>
In a trio of reports released in May, the prestigious and nonpartisan National Academy <A href=""http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12782#toc"" target="""">concluded</A> that &quot;a strong, credible body of scientific evidence shows that <mark>climate change</mark> is occurring, is caused largely by human activities and poses significant risks for a broad range of human and natural systems.&quot; Our nation's most authoritative and respected scientific body couldn't make it any clearer or more conclusive.
</P><P>
When I was chairman of the House Committee on Science, top scientists from around the world came before our panel. They were experts that Republicans and Democrats alike looked to for scientific insight and understanding on a host of issues. They spoke in probabilities, ranges and concepts - always careful to characterize what was certain, what was suspected and what was speculative. Today, <mark>climate</mark> scientists - careful as ever in portraying what they know vs. what they suspect - report that the body of scientific evidence supporting the consensus on <mark>climate change</mark> and its cause is as comprehensive and exhaustive as anything produced by the scientific community.
</P><P>
While many in politics - and not just of my party - refuse to accept the overwhelming scientific evidence of <mark>climate change</mark>, leaders of some of our nation's most prominent businesses have taken a different approach. They formed the U.S. <mark>Climate</mark> Action Partnership. This was no collection of mom-and-pop shops operated by &quot;tree huggers&quot; sympathetic to any environmental cause but, rather, a step by hard-nosed, profit-driven capitalists. General Electric, Alcoa, Duke Energy, DuPont, <mark>Dow Chemical</mark>, Ford, General Motors and Chrysler signed on. USCAP, persuaded by scientific facts, called on the president and Congress to act, saying &quot;in our view, the <mark>climate change</mark> challenge will create more economic opportunities than risks for the U.S. economy.&quot;</P><P>
There is a natural aversion to more government regulation. But that should be included in the debate about how to respond to <mark>climate change</mark>, not as an excuse to deny the problem's existence. The current practice of disparaging the science and the scientists only clouds our understanding and delays a solution. The record flooding, droughts and extreme weather in this country and others are consistent with patterns that scientists predicted for years. They are an ominous harbinger.
</P><P>
The new Congress should have a policy debate to address facts rather than a debate featuring unsubstantiated attacks on science. We shouldn't stand by while the reputations of scientists are dragged through the mud in order to win a political argument. And no member of any party should look the other way when the basic operating parameters of scientific inquiry - the need to question, express doubt, replicate research and encourage curiosity - are exploited for the sake of political expediency. My fellow Republicans should understand that wholesale, ideologically based or special-interest-driven rejection of science is bad policy. And that in the long run, it's also bad politics.
</P><P>
What is happening to the party of Ronald Reagan? He embraced scientific understanding of the environment and <mark>pollution</mark> and was proud of his role in helping to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals. That was smart policy and smart politics. Most important, unlike many who profess to be his followers, Reagan didn't deny the existence of global environmental problems but instead found ways to address them.
</P><P>
The National Academy reports concluded that &quot;scientific evidence that the Earth is warming is now overwhelming.&quot; Party affiliation does not change that fact.

It would peer-review research and publish those findings in a database. It would organize conferences to educate government and industry officials. </P><P>Dourson's organization filled a gap left by the EPA, which has evaluated the safety of only 558 of 84,000 chemicals on the market today. The EPA's sluggishness has created major business opportunities for firms like TERA because few state agencies have the resources to conduct their own risk-assessment studies, which are time-consuming and complex. </P><P>Dourson, a toxicologist who spent 15 years with the EPA, describes TERA as an independent firm that aims to protect public health by bringing together scientists from government, academia and industry. Through TERA, he has created a self-sustaining network of supporters in which clients, regulators and peer-reviewers often overlap. The firm's reach has helped make Dourson an influential figure in the field of risk assessment—a niche discipline that is used to determine how much of a particular chemical is acceptable in the environment. The results of these studies shape thousands of public health decisions around the country, including the setting of drinking water standards and air <mark>pollution</mark> guidelines.</P><P>&quot;People come to us specifically because they want to build a collaboration,&quot; Dourson, 62, said in a recent telephone interview from his office in Cincinnati. </P><P>But an investigation by the Center for Public Integrity and Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News shows the firm has close ties to chemical manufacturers, tobacco companies and other industry interests. More than 50 percent of the peer-review panels TERA has organized since 1995 were for studies funded by industry groups. TERA also runs a risk-assessment database that receives financial and in-kind support from many companies and government agencies. Some of those groups have also paid TERA to peer-review studies they hope will be included in the database.</P><P>A 2011 study on acrylamide—a possible carcinogen found in French fries and potato chips— shows the extent of overlapping interests. </P><P>The acrylamide study, which aimed to evaluate the chemical's oral cancer risk, was funded by Burger King, Frito-Lay and other food companies. Four of its eight authors were TERA scientists, with Dourson the lead. TERA also selected the panel that reviewed the study. The study's finding—which is 10 times less protective than the EPA's cancer risk for acrylamide—is now posted on the TERA database. The identities of the study's funders are buried in footnotes.</P><P>&quot;TERA goes out of its way to describe itself as a nonprofit, to emphasize it works for government, not just industry...when in fact [Dourson] and his group engage in industry-funded activities all the time,&quot; said Richard Denison, lead senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund.</P><P>Dourson isn't fazed by such complaints. &quot;We get criticized by everyone,&quot; he said. &quot;But that doesn't change the fact that TERA is neutral.&quot;</P><P>No state has taken advantage of TERA's services more than Texas, where a rush of oil and gas production has created air <mark>pollution</mark> problems that the <A href=""http://www.publicintegrity.org/environment/big-oil-bad-air"">Center and Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News have been investigating for 20 months</A>.</P><P>Dourson is a close friend of <A href=""http://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/12/18/16532/texas-weakens-chemical-exposure-guidelines-opens-door-polluters"">Michael Honeycutt</A>, who heads the toxicology division at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), the primary enforcer of the Clean Air Act and other federal environmental laws in Texas. His department has evaluated the toxicity of 45 chemicals since 2007 through its risk assessment program. Two-thirds of the resulting guidelines are less protective than they used to be.</P><P>The TCEQ gave TERA a four-year, $600,000 contract to help review the agency's chemical evaluations. Texas has hosted three conferences put on by the <A href=""http://www.allianceforrisk.org/"">Alliance for Risk Assessment</A>—an affiliate of TERA. Honeycutt sits on the alliance's steering committee and his agency has petitioned the committee to peer-review the agency's work. </P><P>Luke Metzger, the director of Environment Texas, reacted strongly when told of the relationship between Honeycutt and the alliance by the Center and Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News. &quot;If it's not illegal, it certainly raises eyebrows about whether it's proper,&quot; he said. </P><P>Honeycutt is &quot;supposed to be working on behalf of all Texans,&quot; Metzger said. Steering taxpayer dollars toward a firm whose decisions Honeycutt influences &quot;further erodes the quickly diminishing trust we have in him.&quot; </P><P>In an email, TCEQ spokesman Terry Clawson said Honeycutt receives no compensation from the Alliance for Risk Assessment and recuses himself from the steering committee whenever the TCEQ proposes a project.</P><P><STRONG>Opportunities for Bias</STRONG></P><P>Risk assessment creates inherent opportunities for bias, because scientists often make their decisions by extrapolating findings from animal studies to fit humans. Risk assessors decide which questions to ask and which studies to rely on, a process that environmentalists and industry sympathizers can both use to reach conclusions more favorable to their interests. </P><P>Scientists often have to &quot;make assumptions, and make decisions at various points,&quot; said Maria Morandi, a consultant who once worked as a health scientist at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston. &quot;So there is a large potential for bias, depending on who's doing the assessment.&quot; </P><P>Dourson said he created TERA as a 501(c)(3) organization so he could host conferences that bring together representatives of government, academia and industry. He said he viewed conflict-of-interest rules that prevented EPA scientists from receiving money to attend industry events as an impediment to good science. </P><P>He points to the variety of groups TERA has worked with as evidence of the firm's neutrality. </P><P>But Rena Steinzor, a law professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in public health regulation, accuses TERA of &quot;whitewashing the work of industry.&quot;</P><P>About one-third of TERA's business comes from assembling peer-review panels, Dourson said. In each case, TERA selects a group of experts, vets them for potential conflicts of interest and manages the meeting logistics. Having a study reviewed by a disinterested panel of experts is important because it can give legitimacy to a scientist's work.</P><P>An Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News and the Center analysis of the 68 panels and workshops listed on TERA's website shows that most are fairly balanced with respect to the scientists' affiliations. Scientists who usually work for industry are often paired with an equal number of government and academic researchers. </P><P>But a further analysis shows that TERA repeatedly uses experts from a core group of companies and consulting firms. At the top of the list is Dourson himself, who sits on 69 percent of the panels that TERA has organized (other TERA scientists appear on an additional 11 percent). Dourson usually chairs any panel he is a part of.</P><DIV class=""media media-element-container media-image_full""><FIGURE id=""file-265330"" itemscope=""itemscope"" itemtype=""http://schema.org/ImageObject"" class=""file file-image file-image-jpeg with-caption""><FIGCAPTION class=""field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text-long field-label-hidden""><DIV class=""field-items""><P><A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/sites/default/files/styles/icn_full_wrap_wide/public/images/TERAConflictsWeb1000px_2.jpg"">Click to enlarge</A></P></DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><P>Dourson said TERA has a short list of people with a general toxicology background that it trusts to lead its panels. He said that list happens to include him. According to TERA's latest federal tax filing, Dourson was paid $152,392 in 2012. </P><P>&quot;We are not going to impact public health by choosing someone on a panel who is not a credible chair,&quot; he said.</P><P>A review of the panels on TERA's website also shows that more than 50 percent of the studies reviewed were funded by the chemical industry. Of the 240 scientists who've served on TERA panels over the years, only a few came from the environmental community. </P><P>Ruthann Rudel is director of research at the <A href=""http://www.silentspring.org/"">Silent Spring Institute</A>, a nonprofit research center in Massachusetts that focuses on breast cancer and other women's health issues. Rudel served on the alliance steering committee until 2011 and on nine TERA panels from 1997 to 2007.</P><P>She said most risk assessors work for industry groups, and she sometimes felt like a lone stand-in for the environmental health perspective. </P><P>TERA's panels are &quot;probably more polarized in reality than it looks&quot; because TERA gets to select the individual scientists, she said. &quot;Many people in government are very supportive of the industry points of view, and in universities also, there's a lot of privatization of the research.&quot; </P><P>&quot;I struggled often&quot; with whether to join the TERA panels, she said. &quot;By participating, I was giving it some legitimacy. But at the same time, every time I went, I felt like the things I contributed changed the outcome in a material way, so if I wasn't there, it would have been worse.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>'Decidedly Pro-Industry'</STRONG> </P><P>It's nearly impossible to keep up with the ever-expanding array of chemicals made and used in the United States. The EPA's <A href=""http://www.epa.gov/iris/"">Integrated Risk Information System</A>—IRIS—has evaluated less than one percent of the roughly 84,000 chemicals registered with the agency. Some of the assessments that have been delayed for more than a decade are for chemicals known to cause cancer, including arsenic, formaldehyde and hexavalent chromium. </P><P>In 2008, the Government Accountability Office said IRIS was in danger of becoming obsolete because the EPA was completing only a handful of chemical assessments each year, due in part to political interference. The Obama administration has failed to speed up the process, largely because of pressure from Congress and lobbying by the chemical industry.</P><P>The EPA's inaction means that the only information about some chemicals comes from their manufacturers—and trying to absorb the flood of corporate-funded science is like &quot;trying to stop Niagara Falls,&quot; Rudel said. </P><P>&quot;They have lots of resources and lots of bright people, but fundamentally what they want and need to do is limit liability and limit the cost of complying with regulations,&quot; she said.</P><P>The flaws in this system became apparent when an estimated 10,000 gallons of crude MCHM—a chemical used by the coal industry—leaked from storage tanks into West Virginia's Elk River in January. As 300,000 people were ordered not to use their tap water, regulators scrambled to figure out a safe exposure level for the public. They had little information to work with: The Material Safety Data Sheet created by manufacturer Eastman Chemical used the phrase &quot;no data available&quot; 152 times, including in a section on whether the chemical causes cancer.</P><P>In the aftermath of the spill, TERA was hired by a state contractor to convene a panel of health experts. The panel's job was to review the MCHM exposure thresholds set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which based its analysis on information provided by Eastman Chemical. TERA selected four government and university scientists, and made Michael Dourson the panel chair.</P><P>Though Dourson later conceded that he had previously done work for Eastman Chemical, the conflict of interest screening report for the panel did not disclose this.</P><P>The panel recommended a short-term exposure level eight times more stringent than the CDC's. Despite that outcome, Denison, of the Environmental Defense Fund, raised questions about Dourson's role in the process. </P><P>TERA is &quot;often chosen because of the perspective and approach they take, which is decidedly pro-industry,&quot; he said. </P><P>Dourson said TERA's relationship with state governments proves the firm is independent and neutral—a claim its clients are then able to tout. </P><P>In 2003, when Michael Honeycutt became section manager of the TCEQ's toxicology department, he began overhauling the outdated system Texas was using to review the toxicity of chemicals released into the air and water by polluters. The TCEQ hired TERA in 2005 to review its methodology. And TERA <A href=""http://books.inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/chemicalguidelines"">later endorsed TCEQ values for the carcinogens arsenic and hexavalent chromium that were much looser</A> than those used in California or by the EPA. Texas pointed to TERA's review as a scientific stamp of approval.</P><P><STRONG>Working for Big Tobacco</STRONG></P><P>When Dourson launched TERA, one of his first projects was to create a database of risk values. Dubbed the International Toxicity Estimates for Risk Assessment, or ITER, it was described by Dourson as an expansion of the EPA's limited IRIS database. </P><P>&quot;The ITER database is not intended to replace IRIS but to supplement it with a more extensive data set that has been independently peer reviewed,&quot; Dourson said, according to minutes of a 1995 meeting of the American Industrial Health Council, a now-defunct trade group funded by the tobacco industry. </P><P>From its inception, TERA's work caught the attention of that industry, which was in desperate need of image rehabilitation.</P><P>In 1997, TERA received funding from the Center for Indoor Air Research to study the health impacts of secondhand smoke. A 1999 study lists Dourson as one of the co-authors. </P><P>But the center sprang from the tobacco industry's deep pockets and was later discovered to primarily fund research that played down the effects of secondhand smoke. It was disbanded in 1998 by a judge who saw it as a tool to bolster the credibility of tobacco products. Philip Morris revived the group a few years later. </P><P>Dourson defended his decision to work with the tobacco industry. &quot;Jesus hung out with prostitutes and tax collectors. He had dinner with them,&quot; he said. &quot;We're an independent group that does the best science for all these things. Why should we exclude anyone that needs help?&quot;</P><P>Dourson eventually stopped working for the industry because, he said, &quot;they should not be selling cigarettes.&quot; </P><P>Meanwhile, TERA continued to expand its ITER database. TERA claims it is the only website where risk-assessment values from multiple government agencies are displayed in tables that allow for easy comparison, along with detailed explanations of their methodologies. Scientists say this feature is useful because agencies often come up with different toxicity values for the same chemical based on different studies and analytical methods.</P><P>In the two decades since its conception, the database has gained some credibility: the National Library of Medicine links to it, just below the library's link to the EPA's IRIS database.</P><P>But the website also publicizes industry-funded studies. For a fee, TERA will organize a peer-review panel for groups that want their results displayed on ITER. Those clients have included <mark>Dow Chemical</mark>, Frito-Lay and the International Copper Association. If the study passes TERA's review, then the value is entered onto ITER next to the government numbers.</P><P>Dourson describes the project as a public service. &quot;If we don't publish those values then the public won't see them,&quot; he said.</P><P>TERA's critics say the database is misleading and creates a conflict of interest, especially since some of the groups that have paid for ITER reviews—including the American Chemistry Council, the chemical industry's main trade association—have also supported ITER through monetary or in-kind donations. </P><P>&quot;The whole thing is self-reinforcing,&quot; said Sheldon Krimsky, a Tufts university professor who studies corruption in science. &quot;It stinks. I would view this [ITER] as being full of conflicts and not worthy of being taken seriously.&quot; </P><P>Of the 28 ITER panels listed <A href=""http://tera.org/Peer/MeetingReports/index.html"">on TERA's website</A>, half were convened for industry groups such as <mark>Dow Chemical</mark>. Most of the rest were done for Health Canada, the Canadian national health agency. </P><P>Unlike the industry studies whose funders are not clearly identified on ITER, the Health Canada studies that pass TERA's review are conspicuously labeled as Health Canada products.</P><P>Dourson says TERA does not publish every study it is asked to review for the database. He said TERA only considers studies that have been published in peer-reviewed journals.</P><P>But getting something published in a peer-reviewed journal doesn't necessarily validate the work, said Adam Finkel, executive director of the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Program on Regulation and a former director of health standards programs for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.</P><P>He said there is a difference between peer reviewers who closely scrutinize the science—EPA's IRIS studies, for instance, pass through layers of internal, external and public review—and others who say, &quot;I laughed, I cried, I ate the popcorn.&quot; </P><P>Finkel cited <EM>Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology</EM>, on whose editorial board Dourson sits, as an example of a publication that is &quot;very clubby and provides an outlet for a certain one-sided part of the spectrum.&quot;</P><P>The journal has published many industry-backed studies that minimize the risk of bisphenol-A (BPA), a chemical used in food packaging that's been linked to a variety of health problems, including cancer, asthma, heart disease and reproductive problems. </P><P>According to PubMed, a site that tracks scientific publications, 19 of the 33 studies Dourson has co-authored in his career were published in <EM>Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology</EM>. Krimsky says that's not necessarily a problem. &quot;But when you see a substantial number&quot; of studies by a board member published in his own journal, &quot;you start to wonder if the peer review is just a rubber stamp.&quot; </P><P>In 2002, more than 40 health experts from academia, government and environmental groups wrote to the journal's editors expressing concern over its apparent conflicts of interest and lack of editorial independence. Among other things, they cited the fact that the journal receives financial support from a number of corporations and trade groups, including Dow AgroSciences, Proctor &amp; Gamble and the American Chemistry Council.</P><P>Tracey Woodruff, a former EPA scientist who is now a professor at the University of California-San Francisco Medical School, said TERA's actions show it's &quot;too conflicted.&quot; </P><P>&quot;I would not be on one of their committees,&quot; she said.</P><P>Dourson said the only conflict of interest that bothers him is a financial one. &quot;If there's a financial conflict of interest, you're out,&quot; he said. That, he said, is different than having a bias, which is unavoidable.</P><P><STRONG>No Paper Trail </STRONG></P><P>As TERA's reputation grew, Dourson helped found the Alliance for Risk Assessment in 2007. It's a loosely organized group created by TERA and two other nonprofits: Noblis, a research firm, and Concurrent Technologies Corporation, which helped TERA expand ITER back in the 1990's.</P><P>Although Dourson says the alliance is an independent entity, he dominates its leadership. He has been a permanent fixture on the alliance's steering committee since its inception, just as he is a permanent board member—and president—of TERA. </P><P>The alliance displays a long <A href=""http://www.allianceforrisk.org/ARA_Dose-Response_Sponsors.htm"">list of sponsors</A> on its website, including the American Petroleum Institute, the TCEQ and Georgia Pacific. But there is no paper trail for the group. No corporate filing exists, and TERA's nonprofit tax filings don't mention the alliance.</P><P>A joint agreement between the three groups that run the alliance wouldn't require a separate filing, said attorney Marcus Owens, a former director of the Internal Revenue Service's tax-exempt division. But that means &quot;it's virtually impossible to figure out how much money is involved in the activity,&quot; Owens said. &quot;It would be buried in the financial statements.&quot; </P><P>Tax records show founding members Noblis and Concurrent Technologies each earned revenues of approximately $200 million in 2012. TERA took in just over $2 million. </P><P>One of the alliance's most significant projects is a series of conferences it organized shortly after the alliance was conceived. </P><P>The purpose of the meetings, according to the alliance, was to expand upon the findings of a 2009 report on risk assessment science from the National Academy of Sciences. Dourson said the request came from the TCEQ, which has hosted three of the eight conferences at its Austin headquarters. </P><P>Rudel, the former alliance steering committee member, said workshop participants did discuss the report's findings but also spent a lot of time criticizing sections unfavorable to industry. </P><P>The National Academies' report, dubbed the Silver Book, was &quot;a very mobilizing event&quot; in the TERA community, said Woodruff, the UCSF scientist. The alliance's conferences were &quot;essentially formed to respond to ... the things they didn't like.&quot;</P><P>Rudel said one the biggest points of contention was the report's recommendation for evaluating non-carcinogens. The traditional approach held that they all have a threshold—a value below which the chemical is completely safe.

Administrator Pruitt rejected decades of science to keep a dangerous pesticide on the market</H3><P>Chlorpyrifos is a common agricultural pesticide that <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/opinion/sunday/protect-our-childrens-brains.html"">causes neurological harm</A> in children who were exposed to it in utero. In 2016, the EPA’s scientists <A href=""https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/revised-human-health-risk-assessment-chlorpyrifos"">concluded</A> that the agency should ban chlorpyrifos after finding unsafe levels of the chemical on apples, peaches, oranges, and other fruits. <mark>Dow Chemical</mark>, one of the largest makers of chlorpyrifos-based products that has <A href=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-dow-chemical-pesticide-study-20170420-story.html"">actively</A><A href=""https://theintercept.com/2017/01/14/dow-chemical-wants-farmers-to-keep-using-a-pesticide-linked-to-autism-and-adhd/"">fought</A> EPA limits on the chemical’s use, <A href=""http://origin-nyi.thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/317591-corporate-donors-to-trump-inaugural-revealed"">gave $1 million</A> to President Trump’s inauguration committee and <A href=""http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/09/politics/andrew-liveris-dow-chemical-ceo-america-manufacturing-council/"">leads</A> a presidential advisory committee on manufacturing. On March 28, Pruitt <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/us/politics/epa-insecticide-chlorpyrifos.html"">rejected</A> the findings of the EPA’s scientists; denied a petition to ban the chemical; and delayed further action until 2022, when the EPA is required to re-evaluate its safety again.</P><H3>2. The EPA is full of <mark>climate</mark> science deniers, starting at the top</H3><P>Despite the overwhelming <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/"">scientific consensus</A> to the contrary, EPA Administrator Pruitt has <A href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/pruitt-epa-<mark>climate</mark>-change-236790"">questioned</A> whether <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide causes <mark>climate change</mark> and the magnitude of humans’ role in driving it. Pruitt also has staffed the EPA with a litany of <A href=""https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/us/politics/scott-pruitt-environmental-protection-agency.html""><mark>climate change</mark> science deniers</A>, drawing particularly heavily from the office of Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK)—who famously <A href=""http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/234026-sen-inhofe-throws-snowball-to-disprove-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">threw a snowball</A> on the Senate floor to prove that <mark>climate change</mark> is a hoax—to fill senior leadership positions. The EPA transition and beachhead teams, which helped shape the EPA’s early agenda under the Trump administration, also <A href=""https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/us/politics/scott-pruitt-environmental-protection-agency.html"">featured</A> several <mark>climate change</mark> deniers, including Steven Milloy, who refers to the EPA’s finding that greenhouse gases endanger human health and the environment as “<A href=""http://junkscience.com/2017/03/revisiting-the-original-<mark>climate</mark>-sin/"">the original <mark>climate</mark> sin</A>.”</P><H3>3. President Trump determined that <mark>climate change</mark> has no cost</H3><P>On March 28, President Trump signed an <A href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/28/presidential-executive-order-promoting-energy-independence-and-economi-1"">executive order</A> nullifying much of former President Barack Obama’s <A href=""https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/image/president27s<mark>climate</mark>actionplan.pdf""><mark>Climate</mark> Action Plan</A>. As part of that order, Trump <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/social-cost-of-<mark>carbon</mark>-trump-eo-5c753f0e850"">directed</A> federal agencies to stop using the social cost of <mark>carbon</mark>—the estimated economic cost of emitting 1 ton of <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> into the atmosphere—in their cost-benefit analyses. The effect of this wonky change <A href=""https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/reports/2017/04/19/430591/hidden-costs-president-trumps-campaign-erase-social-cost-<mark>carbon</mark>/"">will be significant</A>. If the EPA assumes that 1 ton of <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> has no cost, then the agency will be unable to quantify the benefits of cutting <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>. This will make it easier for Administrator Pruitt to defend weakening or nullifying the Clean Power Plan and other <mark>climate</mark> policies.</P><H3>4. President Trump has proposed drastic funding cuts to the EPA’s scientific research</H3><P>President Trump’s so-called <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/politics/epas-spending-cut-plan/2188/?tid=a_inl"">skinny budget</A> calls for large <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/03/31/new-epa-documents-reveal-even-deeper-proposed-cuts-to-staff-and-programs/?utm_term=.a13fdcd2a992"">budget cuts</A> at the EPA, including a 31 percent reduction agencywide that will slash staff by 25 percent and <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/politics/epas-spending-cut-plan/2188/"">eliminate</A> 56 programs. Many science programs are on the chopping block. The proposal would halve the budget for the <A href=""https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-office-research-and-development-ord"">EPA Office of Research and Development</A>, “whose leading-edge research helps provide the solid underpinning of science and technology for the Agency.” Funding for the EPA’s <A href=""https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/recipients.welcome/displayoption/grants"">Science to Achieve Results</A> grants could disappear, eliminating critical funding for academic research on <A href=""https://www.epa.gov/research-grants/water-research-grants"">water quality</A>, <A href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/trump-plan-40-cut-could-cause-epa-science-office-implode-official-warns"">air <mark>pollution</mark></A>, and other priorities. According to <EM>Science</EM>, former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy warns that President Trump is “not just going after the <mark>climate</mark> science in the agency, but going after the scientists … that do fundamental air and water and land work.”</P><H3>5. President Trump and Congress want to slash the EPA’s scientific expertise</H3><P>Congress created the EPA <A href=""https://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabpeople.nsf/webcommittees/board"">Science Advisory Board</A>, or SAB, in 1978 to “review the quality and relevance of the scientific and technical information being used by the EPA or proposed as the basis for Agency regulations.” The SAB receives <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/04/04/trump-doesnt-just-want-to-cut-the-epas-science-he-wants-to-cut-its-expertise/?tid=ss_tw&amp;utm_term=.ce1ca7127bf1"">significant</A> cuts in the proposed budget: 84 percent from its operating budget and 14 percent from support staff resources. The board may only be able to conduct two peer reviews each year instead of 20.</P><P>Congress is attacking the SAB as well. The EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act, which <A href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1431"">passed</A> the House in March, <A href=""http://blog.ucsusa.org/genna-reed/why-the-epa-science-advisory-board-reform-act-is-bad-for-science"">could prevent</A> the nation’s top scientists from participating in the SAB if, paradoxically, they would be advising the SAB on matters related to their own expertise. The bill also could disqualify scientists who have received EPA grants while making it easier for industry stakeholders to participate in the process. The result would be to threaten the SAB’s ability to provide sound, unbiased scientific advice to the EPA administrator—which is probably the end the bill is designed to achieve.</P><H3>6. Rep. Lamar Smith wants to block the EPA from using sound science to set <mark>pollution</mark> standards</H3><P>Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), an ardent <mark>climate</mark> denier who has been <A href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/lamar-smith-unbound-lays-out-political-strategy-<mark>climate</mark>-doubters-conference"">leading</A> the congressional attack on science, introduced the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act, or <A href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1430"">HONEST Act</A>. It passed the House in March. The HONEST Act would prevent the EPA from issuing rules based on scientific data or models that are not publicly available. The problem is that many data cannot be publicly released because they contain personal health records or trade secrets. As such, the bill could block the EPA from using the best available scientific evidence to set <mark>pollution</mark> limits or develop ambient air quality standards. This is not the result of poorly drafted legislative text—it is intentional. Rep. Smith has a <A href=""http://blog.ucsusa.org/gretchen-goldman/a-dishonest-proposal-the-house-science-committee-resurrects-epa-secret-science-nonsense-in-the-honest-act"">long history</A> of attacking science as a means of making it more difficult for the EPA to hold polluters accountable.</P><H3>7. President Trump has failed to hire scientists throughout the government</H3><P>President Trump has kept many critical science positions vacant since he took office in January. Days after inauguration, Trump issued a <A href=""http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/13/politics/epa-hiring-freeze/index.html"">hiring freeze</A> for the federal government, leaving more than 350 positions at the EPA empty, including more than 100 key science jobs. To date, he has <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/us/politics/science-technology-white-house-trump.html"">not appointed</A> a chief science adviser or staffed the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. John Holdren, former science adviser to President Obama, <A href=""https://www.statnews.com/2017/04/05/science-advisor-trump-white-house/"">says</A> “it would be unwise in the extreme for the president to let the current vacuum in science advice in the White House persist,” since “[i]nsights from science and technology are relevant to many of the decisions about actions and policies that a president must make.”</P><P>These seven attacks—which, sadly, are unlikely to be the last—are part of a coordinated and deliberate agenda. President Trump, Administrator Pruitt, and their allies in Congress want to obscure the science that clearly demonstrates the need to cut air and water <mark>pollution</mark> by the powerful corporate interests that offer them the greatest political support. Without hard science in the way, they can more easily spin the story they want to sell—that corporations can pollute unabated without hurting our lungs, waterways, and <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P><EM>Myriam Alexander-Kearns is a Policy Analyst for the Energy and Environment Policy team at the Center for American Progress.

Things are distorted and twisted from their original form, reversed and turned upside down until you start to wonder what exactly was real in the first place.</P><P dir=""ltr"">The EPA, or Environmental Protection Agency, has a pretty straight-forward purpose outlined by the department’s name: protect the environment. But lately, the department’s actions include scrubbing their website of every mention of <mark>climate change</mark>, ruling that radiation exposure equal to 5,000 chest x-rays is safe and, very quietly, blocking a ban on an insecticide known to be a neurotoxin.</P><P dir=""ltr"">The debate over this chemical, called chlorpyrifos but better known by brand names like <A href=""https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/greenbook-assets/L11710.pdf"">Lorsban</A> or Dursban, has raged for decades but garnered press back in July when <A href=""https://www.metro.us/body-and-mind/health/chlorpyrifos-neurotoxin-senators-banned-insecticides"">multiple senators petitioned</A> for a ban on the insecticide though the EPA wished to keep it legal. What did the senators have against this chemical? It’s in the same chemical family as sarin nerve gas, shown to cause brain damage in kids.</P><H2 dir=""ltr"">How was chlorpyrifos being used before Trump?</H2><P dir=""ltr"">Chlorpyrifos was first introduced in 1965 as a pesticide and according to the EPA <A href=""https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/chlorpyrifos"">remains</A> the pesticide most commonly applied in the United States. Pretty scary considering the now-insecticide is classified as a neurotoxin by the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and is used on common produce items like strawberries, apples and broccoli, among other fruits and vegetables.</P><DIV class=""article-related-post""><DIV class=""more-post-heading""><SPAN class=""more-without-arrow""><SPAN class=""subhead-title"">Related</SPAN><SPAN class=""subhead-title-opt"">Articles</SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-sm-18""><DIV class=""single-related-post clearfix""><DIV class=""related-push-title""><A href=""/news/trump-epa-pick-says-backs-biofuels-program-but-open-to-tweaks/krjqar---fUu2xO4vEHS132sPNRyrhQ"">Trump pick for EPA Scott Pruitt has filed 'dozens' of lawsuits against the
EPA
</A><STRONG>01/18/17</STRONG></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P dir=""ltr"">Attitudes on the chemical changed a bit during the Clinton administration. In 1996, they signed into law an act that required regular scientific reviews of pesticides based on safety benchmarks for children’s health. One review on chlorpyrifos resulted in a ban on the chemical for almost all residential and indoor uses in 2000. The EPA follow up with an additional ruling that the chemical would remain classified as safe for agricultural and industrial uses.</P><P dir=""ltr"">Dissatisfied with this split ruling — since agricultural use impacts food consumed by children — the Pesticide Action Network of North America and the Natural Resources Defense Council jointly filed a petition requesting that they either ban chlorpyrifos completely or issue hard and fast limits on the acceptable levels of the chemical in food. The Ninth Circuit court of appeals backed the petition, according to Snopes, ruling that the EPA had to respond with one of the outlined options by October 31, 2015.</P><H2 dir=""ltr"">What did the EPA decide about chlorpyrifos?</H2><P dir=""ltr"">The EPA conducted another review of the chemical and <A href=""https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EPA-HQ-OPP-2015-0653-0001"">filed a suggestion</A> that all published tolerances (limits on acceptable levels) of chlorpyrifos on food be revoked, meaning a ban of the chemical. The department cited a serious concern as their basis for the decision, saying they could not “determine that aggregate exposure to residues of chlorpyrifos, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other non-occupational exposures for which there is reliable information, are safe.”</P><H2 dir=""ltr"">So why is it up for debate again?</H2><P dir=""ltr"">All of those reviews changed when Scott Pruitt, the current EPA Administrator, stepped in. Pruitt claims the reviews from previous administrations are dubious and questions their findings’ validity. Based on this belief, Pruitt turned the EPA in a 180 and <A href=""http://archive.is/XAUYw"">denied the petition</A>. And that’s where the company <mark>Dow Chemical</mark>s sparked some debate.</P><H2 dir=""ltr"">So how is <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> involved?</H2><P dir=""ltr"">Pruitt’s abrupt decision to reverse the EPA findings of previous administrations raised eyebrows because it sounds eerily like the <A href=""https://apnews.com/a29073ecef9b4841b2e6cca07202bb67"">demands made</A> of the Trump administration by letters submitted by lawyers on behalf of <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> and two other companies that produce these types of chemicals to urge that the findings of past studies that the companies found dubious “be set aside.” As the Associated Press points out, the CEO of <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> is “a close advisor to Trump.” (Pictured below.)</P><H2 dir=""ltr"">Why are people upset about this recently?</H2><P dir=""ltr"">You can thank Chelsea Handler for resurfacing the issue again. She posted a tweet on November 19, 2017 that was quickly shared by over 33,000 users and liked over 45,000 times. Although not all of her claims within the tweet text are completely true — Snopes <A href=""https://www.snopes.com/trump-reverses-insecticide-ban-dow-chemicals/"">addresses them all</A> if you’re curious — it did get plenty of attention.</P><P> </P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""twitter-tweet"" data-lang=""en""><P dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Chlorpyrifos is a chemical from <mark>Dow Chemical</mark> Company. It came from the nazis and is a nerve agent that does irreversible brain damage. It was supposed to banned this year, but trump decided to let it be used on fruits and vegetables. Dow gave trump 1 million dollars.</P>— Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) <A href=""https://twitter.com/chelseahandler/status/932346136047755264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">November 19, 2017</A></BLOCKQUOTE><P> </P><P dir=""ltr"">The text from this tweet was picked up by the organization Really American in a <A href=""http://archive.is/OPKwm"">video posted to their Facebook page,</A> which called for a total ban on chlorpyrifos.</P><H2 dir=""ltr"">So, the chemical was supposed to be banned but now Trump’s allowing it?</H2><P dir=""ltr"">Sort of. Yes, the chemical was supposed to be banned after the EPA’s report in 2015. But it’s only indirectly because of Trump. The person who made the decision to reverse this ban was Scott Pruitt, the EPA Administrator. Trump can only be held responsible for appointing Pruitt, who then made this decision.</P><H2 dir=""ltr"">Did Trump take money from <mark>Dow Chemical</mark>?</H2><P dir=""ltr"">Absolutely yes. The chemical company “donated one million dollars to Trump’s inaugural committee” according to Snopes, which The Hill reports was one of Trump’s largest donations. He wasn’t the only one to get a hefty chunk of dough, either. George W. Bush got some money from the chemical company to the tune of $250,000 to his 2005 inaugural committee. Coincidently, or not, Bush also sought to diminish restrictions on chlorpyrifos.</P><P dir=""ltr"">The company did not give any money to Obama’s inaugural funds for either of his terms, Snopes reports, and it was during the Obama administration that the EPA issued their review that suggested a complete ban on the chemical.</P><P dir=""ltr"">So, yes, in terms of what happened first, Trump accepted $1 million from <mark>Dow Chemical</mark>, and then his administration overturned the ban on a chemical this company produces.</P><DIV> </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
