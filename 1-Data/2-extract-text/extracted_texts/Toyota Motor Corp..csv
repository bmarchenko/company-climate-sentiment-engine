        Melbourne 3000</A></DIV></DIV><P>The head of car giant General Motors has publicly warned the switch to biofuels such as ethanol and electric cars is now inevitable and with oil prices at record highs, motorists may soon become familiar with the phrase &quot;peak oil&quot;.</P><P>It is the theory that more than half the planet's oil reserves have now been used and demand will inevitably outstrip supply, driving prices ever higher.</P><P>While some experts reject the theory, arguing the planet still holds enormous reserves of oil and gas, peak oil has won a powerful new backer.</P><P>This week, the chief executive of US car giant General Motors, Rick Wagoner, publicly warned the switch to biofuels such as ethanol and electric cars was now inevitable.</P><P>Mr Wagoner concedes the petrol engine's days are numbered, saying oil supply has peaked and the race is on for replacement fuels.</P><P>&quot;We need to develop alternative sources of propulsion based on diverse sources of energy,&quot; he said.</P><P>At the massive Detroit car show, the battle lines are drawn as rivals jostle for the spotlight to show off their green machines - electric petrol hybrids, ethanol friendly engines and more.</P><P>Toyota Australia spokesman David Buttner says it is all clean, healthy competition.</P><P>&quot;If it's a race to find the best way forward, then the best results we're going to get, the faster we're going to really modify the existing technologies, but also the faster we're going to find those new technologies,&quot; he said.</P><H3>Oil prices</H3><P>The cost of crude cracked $US100 a barrel last month and experts predict the price for crude will keep rising as global demand grows faster than supply.</P><P>For Australians, it means higher prices at the pump, possibly $2 a litre for petrol this year.</P><P>It is not just private motorists affected, consumers will pay for the ever increasing costs of moving goods long distance.</P><P>New South Wales Greens MP John Kaye says the day of the gas guzzler is over.</P><P>&quot;It's not the Greens or the environment movement that will end the gas guzzler, it is Mother Nature herself,&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;This is going to have a huge impact on the way we transport ourselves around cities, around the country.&quot;</P><P>Dr Kaye uses pedal power, riding his bike for transport.</P><P>Before he became a NSW Greens MP, he was an electrical engineer with a PhD from California's prestigious Berkeley University.</P><P>He has spent decades researching energy sources and arguing the case for fossil fuel alternatives.</P><P>&quot;To ignore the warning coming from the senior executives of General Motors would be to condemn us to a future where we lose the ability to move,&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;Those economies that thrive and prosper will be those that invested in mass public transport, urgently and immediately.&quot;</P><H3>Major issues</H3><P>Federal Minister for Science and <mark>Innovation</mark> Kim Carr there are major issues that society will have to deal with.</P><P>&quot;The major question arises in regards to the productivity of the nation, the major social questions that arise about the questions that relate to where people live,&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;It is, of course, a major issue for the society to deal with.</P><P>&quot;That's why the Labor Government is moving forward to work with the states to ensure that we have the opportunities available through the development of appropriate infrastructure.&quot;</P><P>More and more US corn and canola fields are producing ethanol. But the drive to make biofuels from crops is driving up the price of grains worldwide.</P><P>Last year, Mexicans struggled to pay for their staple food - the corn bread, tortilla.</P><P>Total Environment Centre spokesman Leigh Martin says adverse effects on the environment must be avoided in the drive for biofuel creation.</P><P>&quot;We need to make sure that diversion of crops into the creation of ethanol doesn't simply drive up fuel prices and that we don't create other global warming problems by clearing vegetation to create crops for generating ethanol,&quot; he said.</P><H3>Biofuel concerns</H3><P>The European Union, which has set a 10 per cent biofuel target, is increasingly concerned about the wholesale clearance of rainforests in Indonesia, Brazil and Latin America to make way for biofuel crops.</P><P>Mr Kaye says In a greenhouse-constrained world where there are difficulties with agriculture, putting pressure on food supplies should be avoided.</P><P>&quot;The last thing we want to do is put transport in competition with food supply, and that's precisely what bioethanol will do,&quot; he said.</P><P>Here in Australia, it is mostly wheat being grown for ethanol and now there is a car to fit - a GM Saab that runs on 85 per cent ethanol.</P><P>The fuel to power it will be on sale in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane.</P><P>A recent CSIRO study predicted that if all currently exported wheat was used to make ethanol, it would replace between 11 per cent and 22 per cent of petrol used.</P><P>But Australia would be forced to import wheat in drought years.</P><P>Senator Carr says there are many issues that need addressing.</P><P>&quot;There are issues that relate to the question of the uses of land supply, there are questions that relate to whether fuel or food is produced from the crops that are available, there are new technologies,&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;However that mean coming on board, which means that we are able to think about different ways in which we can produce biofuels into the future.&quot;</P><H3>Hybrid cars</H3><P>More than a million new cars hit Australia's roads last year, the most popular still, the six-cylinder Holden Commodore.</P><P>But a small and growing proportion, just under 4,000, were imported petrol-electric hybrids.</P><P>They have batteries that charge on the road and use around 50 per cent less fuel.</P><P>Unlike most other drivers, Jacqueline McCann can still laugh when the talk turns to petrol prices.</P><P>&quot;It's very, very cheap to run, I probably fill it up once every three weeks and it's a nice stylish car. It's smooth to drive, it's got everything I need,&quot; she said.</P><P>&quot;[I'm] making a lot of savings on petrol and you can't be unhappy about that.'</P><P>The fully electric car is on the drawing boards of the big car makers.</P><P>US General Motors chief executive Rick Wagoner says they are inevitable.</P><P>&quot;So are electrically-driven vehicles the answer for the mid and long term? For sure,&quot; he said.</P><P>But the future electric plug-in cars will only be as clean as their sources of energy.</P><H3>Cleaner energy</H3><P>Australia relies overwhelmingly on coal, unless it shifts to cleaner sources of electricity, the electric plug-in car would be a step backwards in terms of <mark>CO2</mark> emissions.</P><P>Dr Kaye says a transformation of the transport system in Australia from gasoline based to electricity generated by coal would cause an 18 million tonne a year increase in the nation's greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries spokesman Andrew McKeller says there are important challenges ahead.</P><P>&quot;In terms of the future of coal-fired power stations and clean coal, other sources of electricity, those are important challenges that have to be addressed as part of the overall solution,&quot; he said.</P><P>The Holy Grail is the hydrogen powered car.</P><P>BMW showed off its prototype in Melbourne on Thursday.</P><P>The company says governments must develop the solar and wind energy sources to drive the creation of hydrogen from sea water.</P><P>BMW spokesman Guenther Seemann says the company has shown the way forward.</P><P>&quot;If you want to clap hands you need two hands, right?&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;From our part we showed that a car manufacturer is able to produce an engine with zero emission.</P><P>&quot;The other side is the total infrastructure which is needed to run such cars and this [something] a car company cannot do alone.&quot;</P><H3>Australian cars</H3><P>But Australian car makers are yet to progress in the race to the clean, green car.</P><P>General Motors Holden unveiled a prototype for an electric-petrol car in 2000, but the project stalled.</P><P>Today, it is a Sydney Museum piece.</P><P>The Federal Government is encouraging local manufacturers to go green.</P><P>It will give the industry up to $500 million through its green car <mark>innovation</mark> fund.</P><P>&quot;There are plans under way now to introduce a whole range of new technologies, a whole range of new capabilities,&quot; Mr McKeller said.</P><P>Senator Carr says Australian motor companies will rise to the challenge faced by <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;In my judgment, we will see new technologies emerge in Australia,&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;We want to do all we can to encourage the commercialisation of those technologies, so that Australians do have the options to drive Australian made, green cars.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The former are a combination of light and radar instruments mounted on the top of vehicles that use imaging in a 360-degree environment from a radar and light beams to measure the speed and distance of surrounding objects. Along with sensors placed along the front, sides, and back of vehicles, these instruments provide information that keeps fast-moving cars and trucks in their own lane, avoids other vehicles, applies brakes and steering when needed, and does so instantly so as to avoid accidents.</P><P>Because these cameras and sensors compile a huge amount of information and needs to process it instantly in order to avoid the vehicle in the next lane, autonomous vehicles require high performance computing, advanced algorithms, and deep learning systems to adapt to new scenarios. This means that software is the key, not the physical car or truck itself.</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""right-pullquote""><P>This means that software is the key, not the physical car or truck itself.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Advanced software enables cars to learn from the experiences of other vehicles on the road and adjust their guidance systems as weather, driving, or road conditions shift. Onboard systems can learn from other vehicles on the road through machine-to-machine communications.</P><P>Autonomous vehicles are likely to spread in niche markets before they become popular in the broader consumer market. The initial cost of automated cars will be high, due to the addition of cameras, sensors, lasers, and artificial intelligence systems, therefore precluding adoption by the typical consumer. Rather, businesses and niche areas are positioned to be the early adopters. The most likely adopters include those with an interest in ride-sharing cars, buses, taxis, trucks, delivery vehicles, transport vehicles for senior citizens and the disabled, and industrial applications.</P><P>Ride-sharing companies are very interested in autonomous vehicles. They see advantages in terms of customer service and labor productivity. All of the major ride-sharing companies are exploring driverless cars. The surge of car sharing and taxi services such as Uber and Lyft in the United States, Daimler’s Mytaxi and Hailo services in Europe, and Didi Chuxing in China demonstrate the viability of this transportation option.</P><P>Delivery vehicles and “platoon” trucks traveling together represent another area likely to see quick adoption of autonomous vehicles. Purchases through online platforms and e-commerce sites are rising rapidly, and this has been a boon to home delivery firms. People want to order things electronically and get them delivered within hours.</P><H2>Benefits of autonomous vehicles</H2><P>Highway deaths are a major problem around the world. In the United States, an estimated 35,000 people die in auto accidents each year. Worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, 1.24 million people die annually due to highway accidents.<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">3</SUP> It is estimated that traffic fatalities cost $260 billion each year and that accident injuries account for another $365 billion. This represents a total of $625 billion annually from highway fatalities and injuries.<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">4</SUP></P><P>According to a RAND study, “39 percent of the crash fatalities in 2011 involved alcohol use by one of the drivers.”<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">5</SUP> This is an area where autonomous vehicles almost certainly will produce major gains in terms of lives saved and injuries avoided. Around 94 percent of U.S. vehicular accidents involve human error, and therefore are potentially avoidable.<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">6</SUP></P><P>Traffic congestion is a problem in virtually every large metropolitan area. In the United States, for example, drivers spend an average of 40 hours stuck in traffic, at an annual cost of $121 billion.<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">7</SUP> Research by Donald Shoup has found that up to 30 percent of the traffic in metropolitan areas is due to drivers circling business districts in order to find a near-by parking space.<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">8</SUP> That represents a major source of traffic congestion, air <mark>pollution</mark>, and environmental degradation. Cars are thought to be responsible for “approximately 30% of the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>) emissions behind <mark>climate change</mark>.”<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">9</SUP></P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""pullquote""><P>Autonomous vehicles can save on fuel and provide benefits for the environment as a whole.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Automobiles are major contributors to poor quality air. According to a RAND study, “AV [autonomous vehicle] technology can improve fuel economy, improving it by 4-10 percent by accelerating and decelerating more smoothly than a human driver.”<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">10</SUP> Since smog in industrial areas is linked to the number of vehicles, having more autonomous cars is likely to reduce air <mark>pollution</mark>. A 2016 research study estimated that “<mark>pollution</mark> levels inside cars at red lights or in traffic jams are up to 40 percent higher than when traffic is moving.”<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">11</SUP></P><H2>Needed actions</H2><P>The biggest U.S. challenge is overcoming the fragmentation of 50 state governments and implementing uniform guidelines across geographic boundaries. Public officials should address questions such as who will regulate autonomous vehicle technology and how will it be regulated and issues such as legal liability, privacy, and data collection.</P><H3><EM>Provide guidelines for the states</EM></H3><P>Right now, there are few agreed-upon technical standards and a hodgepodge of regulation at the state government levels.<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">12</SUP> Industry officials have to deal with 50 sets of state rules that can differ dramatically. According to Chris Urmson, formerly of Google, “in the past two years, 23 states have introduced 53 pieces of legislation that affect self-driving cars – all of which include different approaches and concepts. Five states have passed such legislation, and – although all were intended to assist the development of the technology in the state – none of those laws feature common definitions, licensing structures or sets of expectations for what manufacturers should be doing.”<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">13</SUP> All of this complicates the task of car developers who need a more unified approach. Companies can’t design cars for Texas that won’t operate in Illinois, Florida, or New York.</P><FIGURE id=""id=&quot;attachment_334852&quot; "" class=""wp-caption aligncenter size-article-inline""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Cars travel north towards Los Angeles on interstate highway 5 in San Diego, California February 10, 2016. Picture taken February 10. To match Insight AUTOS-AUTONOMOUS/INFRASTRUCTURE REUTERS/Mike Blake – RTSCYIN</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>California, in particular, has passed legislation that is overly restrictive. It sets back fully autonomous vehicles by requiring a driver in the front seat and prevents companies from removing human-operated steering wheels and brakes. That restriction potentially negates some of the benefits of driverless cars while also creating a barrier to <mark>innovation</mark> in the automotive industry.</P><P>In an effort to simplify the regulatory apparatus, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is expected to release new rules designed to promote <mark>innovation</mark> while protecting consumer safety. Among the likely features are the provision of guidelines for uniform regulations in the states, providing exemptions to outmoded safety regulations, operational guidance for new features, and new tools for encouraging autonomous vehicles.</P><P>But in a setback for manufacturers, the national government is insisting that fully autonomous vehicles retain a steering wheel and brakes, and that there be a licensed driver in the car. Some designers argue that having those override features opens the door to drunk drivers and creates a dangerous sense of complacency for drivers.</P><H3><EM>Address legal liability</EM></H3><P>Consumers cite lower insurance costs as one of the things they like about autonomous vehicles. Almost one-third gave that reason, followed by increased safety and switches to self-driving model as reasons they would buy a partially autonomous vehicle.</P><P>It is not clear, though, how insurance companies will handle liability claims in the new world of transportation. Is the accident the fault of the driver, the writer of the software code that controls automated features, or the car manufacturer who made the hardware? It will take some law suits to resolve attributions of responsibility. Insurance firms will take a while to develop actuarial tables based on accident records so they know what premiums to charge drivers.</P><P>A RAND study recommends “no fault” insurance for autonomous vehicles. Its rationale is that driverless cars are less prone to human errors and therefore they represent a fundamental change in legal liability.<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">14</SUP> Driverless cars essentially shift more of the responsibility from drivers to manufacturers and software designers.</P><P>For the latter, product liability law is a promising way to think about legal responsibility. Manufacturers are responsible for defective conditions so their liability would hinge on whether there was a reasonable expectation than their products would operate as expected and not pose undue risks to passengers.</P><H3><EM>Improve data protection and security</EM></H3><P>Data collected through vehicles enable new business models. For example, in the insurance industry, “a connected vehicle allows an insurance company to really look at you individually in terms of your actual driving and your real risk and real time situational awareness, so they can innovate a lot of products and a lot of pricing strategies aimed at trying to keep you out of harm’s way, and almost pivot from selling insurance to selling assurance.”<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">15</SUP></P><DIV class=""inline-widget alignleft""><H3>Related Books</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Congress has rebuffed a tax on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, which Keith and other <mark>climate</mark> scientists say would be the best way to spur clean-energy <mark>innovation</mark>. Opponents such as the American Petroleum Institute say the tax could boost energy prices and hurt the U.S. economy.</P><P class=""p-text""><B>STORY: </B><A href=""/story/news/nation/2013/12/30/plastic-from-<mark>carbon</mark>-emissions/4192945/"" title=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/30/plastic-from-<mark>carbon</mark>-emissions/4192945/"">Plastic made from <mark>pollution</mark> hits U.S. market</A></P><P class=""p-text"">Global leaders have also made little progress in agreeing to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which continue to increase as rapidly developing nations such as India and China use coal to power economic growth.</P><P class=""p-text"">Still, change is bubbling up. Dozens of states now require that a portion of their electricity come from renewable sources. In October, California became the first to require its utilities to install energy-storage equipment — expected to boost technologies such as batteries that can be used when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow. China has increased its use of solar power to reduce the smog blanketing its major cities.</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;The good news: We already know how to do a lot,&quot; says Jane Long, who's leading the California Council on Science and Technology's study on how the state can meet its pledge to slash emissions 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. Even so, she says breakthrough technologies, requiring a public and private partnership, will be needed to make fuels with nearly zero emissions.</P><P class=""p-text"">There's not a lot of time to make changes, says <mark>climate</mark> scientist David Archer of the University of Chicago. He says research suggests dire changes could occur if the Earth warms 2 degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) this century.</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;We're halfway there,&quot; Archer says, adding the planet could reach that mark as soon as 2040 if <mark>carbon</mark> emissions continue their current climb. &quot;This is just the fire alarm. This is not the fire,&quot; he says, adding it will become costlier to cut emissions the closer the flames come.</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;It's important to recognize we don't know everything about <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; Christopher Field told reporters last December at MIT's <mark>climate</mark> &quot;boot camp.&quot; Yet Field, a senior fellow at Stanford University and co-author of research by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, said enough is known to help society manage the risks and make smart investments.</P><P class=""p-text"">The 19th-century horse-manure crisis suggests some solutions may beget new problems, says Eric Morris, an urban planning professor at Clemson University who studied that malodorous chapter of history. But he says it also offers another lesson: &quot;Never discount the power of human ingenuity.&quot;</P><P class=""p-text"">Here are six technologies — some old, some new — that might stem the worrisome warming trend:</P><P class=""p-text"">1.<B>Solar geo-engineering </B> is sort of the Hail-Mary pass when attempts to cut <mark>carbon</mark> emissions don't go far enough. It includes blasting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight away from Earth or spraying fine sea salt into the sky to whiten clouds.</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;They all act very fast. They're all cheap enough that money is not the issue and they're all inherently imperfect,&quot; says Keith, author of the 2013 book <I>A Case for <mark>Climate</mark> Engineering. </I>&quot;The thing we most need to do is talk about it,&quot; he says, adding more research is needed on the effects and efficacy.</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;One powerful country could do it by itself,&quot; if desperate enough for a quick but temporary fix,&quot; says <mark>climate</mark> scientist Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science. He notes how Mount Pinatubo's 1991 eruption in the Philippines, which fired sulfur particles high into the air, cooled global temperatures nearly one degree Fahrenheit in 1992 and 1993.</P><P class=""p-text""><B>2. <mark>Carbon</mark> capture, </B>which traps emissions from power plants and removes them the atmosphere<B>, </B>might obviate the need for such a drastic step.</P><P class=""p-text"">Because of its current high cost,  no commercial, coal-fired facility has yet to employ this technique. In May, the first effort is slated to debut in Kemper County, Miss; it's designed to capture 65% of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. Earlier this year, MIT developed a simpler scrubbing system that it says can be added relatively easy to existing facilities.</P><P class=""p-text"">The U.S. Department of Energy is funding research on how to capture industrial emissions and either store them underground or use them to make products such as fuel, plastics, cement and fertilizer. Without federal funds, Mark Herrema founded Newlight Technologies, a California-based company that captures methane emissions from dairy farms and uses them to make plastic.</P><P class=""p-text"">Klaus Lackner, a Columbia University geophysicist, is working on synthetic trees that absorb <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide about a thousand times faster than natural trees. Keith's Calgary-based start-up, <mark>Carbon</mark> Engineering, funded partly by Bill Gates, is developing industrial-scale technologies to capture <mark>carbon</mark> from the atmosphere and use it to produce low-<mark>carbon</mark> transportation fuels.</P><P class=""p-text"">3. <B>Artificial photosynthesis </B>could yield an entirely new, emissions-free energy source. In 2011, Nocera unveiled his &quot;artificial leaf&quot; — a credit-card-sized silicon solar wafer that, when placed in a glass of tap water and exposed to sunlight, generates hydrogen and oxygen bubbles that can be stored and — when needed — recombined in a fuel cell to generate electricity.</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;We already know how to do this,&quot; Nocera says. The problem: His water-splitting device generates hydrogen fuel, but there's no network yet of hydrogen filling stations in the United States. So his start-up, Sun Catalytix, launched to develop the device, is now focusing instead on grid-scale flow batteries.</P><P class=""p-text"">DOE is funding related research at the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, led by the California Institute of Technology. &quot;The goal is to produce a chemical liquid fuel&quot; that can replace gasoline, says spokesman William Royea, adding it will likely take a decade or so to reduce costs enough to make it commercially viable.</P><P class=""p-text"">4.<B> Solar and wind power</B> have surged in recent years, and research is finding new applications. MIT and Sandia National Laboratories have developed ultralight, atom-thin solar cells that can be embedded in flexible products like drapes or harder structures like a tablet's outer shell to produce power. Similarly, they're developing transparent cells that can be placed on windows.</P><P class=""p-text"">Companies such as California-based Makani, acquired this year by Google, are trying to harness power from high-altitude wind, which is faster and steadier. Their challenge: tethering airborne turbines hundreds of feet off the ground without interfering with aircraft. MIT researchers are looking at far-offshore wind turbines and, to store their power and anchor them, huge concrete spheres that sit on the seafloor.</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;Storage will be the game changer&quot; for solar and wind, because their power is intermittent but electric grids need consistency, says Bob Armstrong,director of the MIT Energy Initiative. So universities, start-ups and major companies are working to boost battery performance. Some advances debuted this year, including a battery by General Electric that's paired with a Texas wind farm to provide continuous power.</P><P class=""p-text"">5. <B>Nuclear power</B>, disliked by many environmentalists because of safety and waste disposal concerns, is welcomed by <mark>climate</mark> scientists including James Hansen as a major energy source that doesn't emit <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P class=""p-text"">DOE has offered $8.3 billion in loan guarantees to help build a nuclear power plant in Georgia and is funding efforts by  two companies — North Carolina-based Babcock &amp; Wilcox and Oregon-based NuScale Power — to develop small modular reactors. These school bus-size versions of current light water reactors could be made in U.S. factories and moved from site to site. DOE says it expects commercial operation around 2025.</P><P class=""p-text"">TerraPower, a start-up in Bellevue, Wash., that's partly funded by Bill Gates, is developing a larger, 500-megawatt, &quot;traveling wave&quot; reactor that runs on nuclear waste and can go 40 years without refueling. Last year, Gates said the company is looking to build a demonstration plant and &quot;China is one possible place.&quot; This month, DOE posted a proposed agreement between an unnamed U.S. company and the Chinese government to develop such a reactor.</P><P class=""p-text"">6. <B>Efficiency </B>is often seen as the invisible energy source, because it's energy not used. Though basic technology, its potential is huge. Long, who's studying California's efforts, estimates efficiency upgrades could halve the state's energy demand by 2050. Building practices such as superior insulation and air sealing have proven to slash a home's energy use up to 90%.</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;This is the best way to get at <mark>climate</mark> mitigation,&quot; says David Gottfried, co-founder of the U.S. Green Building Council, a private non-profit group. Noting that residential and commercial buildings account for nearly 40% of total U.S. energy use, he says ultra-efficient buildings can essentially become &quot;our power plants of the future.&quot;</P><P class=""p-text p-text-last"" id=""article-body-p-last"">IBM is working with cities, utilities and the federal government to boost efficiency by using sensors, meters and digital controls to monitor and automate how energy is used. The Obama administration is requiring new cars and light trucks to nearly double their fuel efficiency by 2025.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Organizations of all types are launching green campaigns—from the city of London’s Congestion Charge on automobiles, to <A href=""http://walmartstores.com/Sustainability/7986.aspx"" title=""Wal-Mart Stores Inc."">Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</A>’s push to sell organic <A href=""http://www.ssireview.org/topics/category/food"">foods</A>, to the University of Texas’s construction of <A href=""http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CategoryID=19"" title=""LEED green buildings"">LEED green buildings</A>. Consumers too are getting behind the idea of being greener. In almost every opinion poll, consumers say that they are very concerned about <mark>climate change</mark>. They worry about rising seas, declining air quality, shrinking animal habitats, lengthening droughts, and newly brewing diseases. And they connect the dots back to their own purchases, finds a 2007 McKinsey &amp; Company global survey of 7,751 consumers in eight major economies.<SUP>1</SUP>Our results show that a full 87 percent of these consumers are concerned about the <A href=""http://www.ssireview.org/topics/category/environment"">environmental </A>and social impacts of the products they buy.</P><P>But when it comes to actually buying green goods, words and deeds often part ways. Only 33 percent of consumers in our survey say they are ready to buy green products or have already done so. And, according to a 2007 <I>Chain Store Age</I> survey of 822 U.S. consumers, only 25 percent say they have bought a green product other than organic food or <A href=""http://www.ssireview.org/topics/category/energy"">energy </A>efficient lighting. By and large, consumers tend to ignore other Earth-friendly products such as carpets made from recycled fiber and energy-saving computers.</P><P>Even the green goods that have caught on have tiny market shares. Organic foods—which consumers buy more for their own health than for the environment’s—accounted for less than 3 percent of all food sales in 2006, according to the <I>Nutrition Business Journal</I>. In 2006, green laundry detergents and household cleaners made up less than 2 percent of sales in their categories. And despite their trendiness, <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_cars"" title=""hybrid cars"">hybrid cars</A> made up little more than 2 percent of the U.S. auto market in 2007, according to a report by J.D. Power and Associates.</P><P>As a result, consumers in the United States and other developed countries have done little to lighten their <mark>carbon</mark> footprints. Some of this lag between talking and walking could reflect consumers’ insincerity, laziness, posturing, or other unsavory traits. But much more of it is because businesses have not educated consumers about the benefits of green products and have failed to create green products that meet consumers’ needs.</P><P>Consumers want to act green, but they expect businesses to lead the way. According to our global survey, 61 percent of consumers say that corporations should take the lead in tackling the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>. To do this, businesses need to develop more and better Earth-friendly products. Some already are, but they are not doing a good job of marketing them, finds a <mark>Climate</mark> Group study, which discovered that two-thirds of American and British consumers cannot name a green brand. Similarly, the 2007 National Technology Readiness Survey of 1,025 U.S. adults found that more than two thirds of participants say they prefer to do business with environmentally <A href=""http://www.ssireview.org/topics/category/socially_responsible_business"">responsible companies</A>, but almost half say it is difficult to find green goods and services.</P><P>Corporations can reap multiple benefits by going green. They can reduce their energy consumption, lessen their risks, meet competitive threats, enhance their brands, and increase their revenues. Consider the success of <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_fluorescent_lamp"" title=""compact fluorescent lightbulbs"">compact fluorescent lightbulbs</A> (CFLs), for example. In 2005, sales of CFLs accounted for less than 5 percent of the total lightbulb market. But only two years later, in 2007—the year that the public woke up to the looming threat of <mark>climate change</mark>—CFLs captured an estimated 20 percent of the lightbulb market, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Companies that sell CFLs, like General Electric Co. (GE), have increased their revenues, enhanced their brands, and strengthened their competitive positions in the market.</P><P>To realize the true potential of the green market, businesses must help consumers change their behaviors. And that requires removing the hurdles between would-be green consumers’ intentions and actions. Based on McKinsey’s work with businesses and other organizations around the world, we have identified five of these hurdles. We also recommend five steps that businesses and other organizations should take to dismantle all of the barriers that prevent consumers from buying green.</P><P><B>WHY ECO’S A NO-GO</B></P><P>Our 2007 study of 7,751 consumers around the world identifies barriers to buying green at every stage of the purchase. First, consumers have to be aware that a product exists before they buy it. Yet many don’t even know about the green alternatives in many product categories. Next, consumers must believe that a product will get the job done. But many believe that green products are of lower quality than their more traditional “browner” counterparts. Consumers must then decide whether a product lives up to its green reputation. Yet many are skeptical about environmental claims, partly because they distrust corporations and the media. Finally, consumers must decide whether a product is worth the cost and effort needed to purchase it. But consumers often believe that the prices of green goods are too high, and have a hard time finding them anyway.</P><P>To increase the sales of environmentally sensible products, companies must remove these five barriers—namely, lack of awareness, negative perceptions, distrust, high prices, and low availability. In other words, they must increase consumers’ awareness of green products, improve consumers’ perceptions of eco-products’ quality, strengthen consumers’ trust, lower the prices of green products, and increase these products’ availability.</P><P>The importance of each barrier varies by product, industry, and geography. For instance, more than 90 percent of consumers who participated in the McKinsey global survey know about CFLs, so lack of awareness is not a barrier to their purchasing them. But many customers think CFLs are too expensive and of dubious quality. In other words, high price and negative perceptions impede these consumers’ progress toward a greener purchase. In contrast, only half of the participants in this study know about <mark>carbon</mark> credits, which are a way that an individual or business can lower its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. Companies that sell these credits invest the money in renewable energy, reforestation, and other activities that reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, offsetting the emissions of the individual or business that purchased the <mark>carbon</mark> credit.</P><P>Across regions, moreover, consumers have different concerns about price and quality within the same product category. In the retail sector, for example, 14 percent of U.S. consumers say they are willing to pay a premium for green products, compared to 26 percent in Brazil, according to the McKinsey global survey. In the petroleum sector, 7 percent of French consumers are willing to pay a premium, compared to 26 percent in India.</P><P>Although the barriers between green thoughts and acts vary by product, industry, and region, the need to remove all barriers does not. In other words, companies have to move customers through the entire purchasing process—from being aware of eco-friendly products, to considering their pros and cons, to paying for the products. Understanding these barriers is the first step to growing green consumers.</P><P><B>FIVE BARRIERS TO GREENING</B></P><P><B>Lack of Awareness</B> Our study and others (such as London-based Account Ability’s report “What Assures Consumers on <mark>Climate Change</mark>?”) show that consumers know about <mark>climate change</mark>, understand that reducing their own greenhouse gas emissions will help fight <mark>climate change</mark>, and want to join that effort. But these studies also show that consumers do not quite understand how to act on their greener impulses. More than one-third of consumers we surveyed say they would like to take action against <mark>climate change</mark> but do not know what to do.</P><P>For example, the top three ways for consumers to reduce their own emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (a greenhouse gas) are to drive a more fuel-efficient car, improve their home’s insulation, and reduce their consumption of beef. Yet the consumers in our study thought that using energy-efficient appliances and recycling were among the top three emission-cutting acts. (They correctly identified driving a more efficient car as one of the top three.) And although eating less beef is among the top three best acts of greenness, the fewest consumers knew how eco-friendly this behavior is.</P><P>Consumers are equally confused about buying green products—and with good reason. Many attempts to label green products are meaningless at best and bewildering at worst. For example, a current labeling program indicates how much <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide an item’s production, packaging, and shipment emitted—that is, its “<A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<mark>Carbon</mark>_footprint"" title=""<mark>carbon</mark> footprint""><mark>carbon</mark> footprint</A>.” But calculating <mark>carbon</mark> footprints requires some very fancy math and results in numbers that few people intuitively understand. “What does it mean to say a bag of chips contains 75 grams of <mark>carbon</mark>?” asked Steve Howard, CEO of the <mark>Climate</mark> Group, in a March 6, 2008, <I>BusinessWeek</I> article. “I have a PhD in environmental physics and it does not mean a thing to me.”</P><P><B>Negative Perceptions</B> Even when consumers can correctly identify environmentally sound products, the green label sometimes proves to be the kiss of death. Some green products—such as <mark>Toyota Motor Corp.</mark>’s <A href=""http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/"" title=""Prius automobile"">Prius automobile</A>—have become status symbols, but many environmentally friendly products suffer an image problem. According to the 2007 GfK Roper Green Gauge study of more than 2,000 Americans, fully 61 percent believe that green goods perform worse than conventional items. Indeed, early green products often trailed behind their conventional competition. Early hybrid cars, for example, had less power than non-hybrid cars. CFL light bulbs also had to overcome problems: Early versions were slow to light up, had weak light when they did illuminate, and didn’t fit properly into most normal light fixtures.</P><P><B>Distrust</B> Consumers doubt not only the quality of green products, but also their very greenness, according to the GfK Roper survey. Although they trust the environmental claims of scientists and environmental groups, they tend not to believe the claims of government, media, and business—and justifiably. A 2007 study by TerraChoice Environmental Marketing Inc. (<A href=""http://www.terrachoice.com/files/6_sins.pdf"" title=""“The Six Sins of Greenwashing”"">“The Six Sins of Greenwashing”</A>) examined 1,753 environmental product claims and found that all but one were misleading or just plain false. In the misleading category: Some companies tout product features that are actually mandated by law. For example, TerraChoice found insecticides, lubricants, oven cleaner gels, cleaners, and disinfectants all labeled as CFC-free. But no products sold today in the United States have CFCs, because the federal government banned the ozone-eating propellants almost three decades ago. Other companies mislead consumers by highlighting one positive product feature while not mentioning their other negative qualities. For instance, paper or lumber products tout their recycled content or <mark>sustainable</mark> harvesting without noting the impact of their manufacturing processes on air and water emissions or global warming. And in the just plain false category: A dishwasher detergent boasted on its 100 percent plastic container that it used 100 percent recycled paper.</P><P><B>High Prices</B> Consumers who get past the sometimes checkered history of eco-friendly products often encounter a fourth barrier: their frequently higher prices. Indeed, price is the largest barrier to buying green products, found the U.K. Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs in its 2007 survey of 3,600 U.K. consumers. Close to half of this survey’s participants want a two-year return on the premium price they pay for a product. Yet 70 percent of green appliances, including energy-efficient televisions, washers, and dryers, take longer to recoup their purchasers’ money. Solar power is another example where, according to our analysis of data from the California Energy Commission, a combination of recent technological advances, government subsidies, and good weather have helped reduce the payback period to less than 10 years in California, making residential photovoltaic usage a practical reality for some consumers but still an expensive luxury for others. Because consumers perceive the benefits of green goods to be small and long term, they often view the often higher costs of these products to be too high.</P><P><B>Low Availability</B> Having decided to buy Earth-friendly items, many consumers encounter a final hurdle: They can’t find them. Biofuel enthusiasts, for example, must often drive out of their way to fill up on their chosen fuel. Many energy-conscious homeowners have no other choice than to buy dirty power because their local utilities simply do not offer clean energy. And many contractors do not know where to purchase green building materials. The reason consumers cannot find these products is that businesses are not stocking them. In 2007, we did an informal survey of 23 grocery retailers in Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area. We found that fewer than half offered green products besides organic food and CFLs. Among the minority that did proffer eco-friendly nonfood items, only about 10 percent stocked more than one product.</P><P><B>BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS</B></P><P>Knowing what stops consumers from buying green products is only half the battle. The other half is knowing how to break down these barriers. Below are five steps for removing the hurdles between green thoughts and green acts. Companies first need to figure out which customers are likely to want which products. They must then examine how people in these different market segments make their purchasing decisions. No matter which barriers prove most important for a given market segment or product, however, businesses must address barriers in all areas before consumers will change their behaviors.</P><P><B>Educate Consumers</B> Because consumers are largely unaware of green alternatives, businesses first need to think of themselves as educators, not salespeople. And they must expand their lesson plans beyond their own products to the larger issues of <mark>pollution</mark>, <mark>climate change</mark>, overfishing, and other environmental problems. And nonprofits and government agencies also need to take up the cause of green education.</P><P>Consider the success of <A href=""http://www.energystar.gov/"" title=""Energy Star"">Energy Star</A>. This program, a joint effort launched by the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy in 1992, educates consumers about how energy-efficient products can reduce energy use, save money, and protect the environment. Every product that meets government energy-efficiency standards can carry the Energy Star label, which has gained widespread consumer recognition and trust. Because federal regulations mandated energy labels on certain appliances, almost half of the air conditioners sold in the United States in 2005 carried the Energy Star label. In addition, in 2005, close to 30 percent of all U.S. homes had energy-efficient refrigerators and washing machines, according to the Vermont Department of Public Service.</P><P>To cite another example: Procter &amp; Gamble Co.’s (P&amp;G) “<A href=""http://www.packagingnews.co.uk/news/737170/Procter---Gamble-unveils-<mark>sustainable</mark>-living-label/"" title=""Future Friendly"">Future Friendly</A>” campaign teaches consumers how they can have a positive impact on the environment by making their homes more energy efficient, using less water, and reducing the amount of household waste. Specific tips include washing clothes in cold water and drying them in the air rather than in a dryer. P&amp;G benefits because it refreshes its brand, enhances its reputation, and protects its market share from new environmentally friendly competitors.</P><P><B>Build Better Products</B> For consumers to improve their opinions of green products, companies must create ones that are equal to, or better than, conventional alternatives. Consumers still value performance, reliability, and durability much more than a product’s ecological soundness. Indeed, to overcome their image problem, green products must often outperform their traditional counterparts.</P><P>GE managed to do this with the CFLs. The first CFLs cost a lot more, and were harder to find than conventional bulbs. Now, they pay for themselves in five months, and are readily available. Wal-Mart has committed to sell 100 million CFLs in 2008 and displays them prominently on its shelves. CFLs piggybacked on Energy Star’s success with the “Change a Light, Change the World” campaign. This effort increased awareness of CFLs and resulted in 500,000 pledges to replace a traditional light bulb with an Energy Star CFL.</P><P>Toyota likewise had to tackle early perceptions that the Prius had less power than non-hybrid cars. Toyota did this by redesigning the Prius to meet performance and style preferences of consumers. The carmaker increased the horsepower and conducted a campaign promoting the vehicle as “quick, roomy, and economical.”</P><P><B>Be Honest</B> In recent years, consumers have caught companies red-handed at “greenwashing”—that is, claiming that their products are far more environmentally friendly than they actually are. To rebuild public trust, companies must inform the public about their true environmental impact, as well as about their attempts to reduce that impact. Many will need to identify and address specific historical concerns about their products or operations. Only then will consumers believe the company’s Earth-sparing claims.</P><P>In 2005, GE launched “<A href=""http://www.grist.org/news/muck/2005/05/10/little-ge/"" title=""Ecomagination"">Ecomagination</A>,” an initiative with the broad objective of meeting environmental challenges such as the need for clean water, renewable energy, and reduced emissions. Ecomagination covered GE’s efforts to enhance its investment in <mark>sustainable</mark> technologies and increase its revenues from <mark>sustainable</mark> products such as lower-emission aircraft engines, efficient lighting, wind turbines, and water purification technology. As part of the Ecomagination campaign, GE also undertook efforts to make its own operations more environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark>. One of the results of the program is that GE kept its greenhouse gas emissions flat in 2005, even as revenues rose.<SUP>2</SUP></P><P>Telling consumers they should act green when the company itself is making little effort to improve its own operations is asking for a backlash. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), a U.K. watchdog, received a fourfold increase in complaints about environmental claims in advertisements in 2007.<SUP>3</SUP> One offender, according to ASA, was the low-price airline Ryanair Ltd., which promoted itself as the industry leader in environmental efficiency. In 2007, however, the airline received significant negative press when CEO Michael O’Leary confessed that his claim that the airline had cut emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide by half over the past five years was an “error.”<SUP>4</SUP></P><P><B>Offer More</B> To increase sales of green products, companies must make sure that consumers understand the returns—both financial and environmental—on their investment. When consumers find it easy to track their savings from using a product, they are more willing to try new green products—especially those that cost more. They also feel more confident about their eco-friendly purchases when they understand how the products help the environment.</P><P>Many companies participate in Energy Star’s voluntary EnergyGuide labeling program. Labels placed on products in retail stores communicate the products’ annual energy use (in watts and dollars) and compares it to similar products. Presented in a simple and clear manner, the information helps consumers choose products that not only are energy efficient but also save them money. The Prius’s value goes well beyond functionality.</P><P>The Prius caught consumers’ imaginations because it had a unique and contemporary style that signaled the owners’ commitment to the environment. Its dashboard communicates fuel consumption and energy efficiency, thereby broadcasting the car’s environmental benefits. By contrast, Honda Motor Co.’s Accord hybrid, which looked more conventional and did not toot its own environmental horn, languished (and was eventually dropped in 2008). In 2006, Prius held 76 percent of the hybrid market; the Accord hybrid, which functioned just as well as the Prius, held just 12 percent.</P><P><B>Bring Products to the People</B> Companies cannot sell their products if consumers cannot find them. It sounds obvious, but many of today’s green products are not widely available. Even finding out how to get them is difficult.</P><P>Wal-Mart and GE have helped make CFLs a successful consumer product by making it easy for consumers to buy them. Wal-Mart put the bulbs in the most coveted place—at eye level on the top two or three shelves. An educational display from GE complements the attractive shelf placement. Toyota communicates its intent to make the Prius widely available by running ads that say: “We’ve significantly increased production on the hard-to-find, easy-to-drive Toyota Prius.” According to <I>AutoInsight</I>, Toyota has increased production of the Prius since 1999 by an average of 50 percent a year.</P><P><B>THE GREEN IMPERATIVE</B></P><P>Businesses alone cannot lead consumers from intention to action. In many instances, the government and the civil sector need to be heavily involved to achieve long-lasting changes in consumer behavior. Nevertheless, businesses should play a leading role in the green movement in order to shape their market opportunities and manage potential regulation of their industries.</P><P>Green products and services are only a niche market today, but they are poised for strong growth. Already, 33 percent of consumers say they are willing to pay a premium for green products, and another 54 percent care about the environment and want to help tackle <mark>climate change</mark>. Entering the green market can also improve companies’ reputations, thereby increasing the value of their brands. Some 70 percent to 80 percent of public companies’ valuation in American and Western European stock markets depends on expectations of the company’s cash flow beyond the next three years. Companies’ reputations strongly shape those expectations, and corporate citizenship is the top driver of reputation, according to the Reputation Institute’s 2007 global survey.</P><P>In addition, firms that have a strong position in the green market can stay ahead of regulation and protect their market share from competitors. More than 80 percent of 2,192 executives surveyed by <I>The McKinsey Quarterly</I> about <mark>climate change</mark> expect some form of <mark>climate change</mark> regulation within the next five years in countries where their companies operate.<SUP>5</SUP>European countries already have limits on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions through the 
<A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol"" title=""Kyoto Protocol"">Kyoto Protocol</A>, and a number of U.S. states have established similar systems. More than 600 mayors from around the world have committed their cities to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.</P><P>The most proactive companies will lead regulation, and may even push for stricter regulations that will put their less environmentally savvy competitors at a disadvantage. Newcomers, in turn, can steal market share from existing companies by appealing to the growing legions of green consumers. 
<A href=""http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/"" title=""Whole Foods Market Inc."">Whole Foods Market Inc.</A>, with its double-digit sales growth in the essentially flat supermarket industry, is a powerful example of a new entrant that is not only winning market share with a green and ethical offering, but also taking share in the premium segment of the market.</P><P>Companies may rightly ask whether cultivating green consumers is worth all the trouble. We believe that it is not only worth the trouble, but also imperative for success. Once businesses remove the obstacles between consumers’ desire to buy green and the actual follow-through of those sentiments, green products could experience explosive sales growth. What’s more, building a reputation as an Earth-friendly corporation can do much more than generate increased revenues from green products. The better a company’s reputation, the more talented the employees it can attract, the more loyalty it can inspire in its customers, and the more it can charge for its products.</P><P><I>This article has benefited from the thoughtful and ongoing insights of our fellow McKinsey &amp; Company colleagues, especially Nadeem Sheikh and Jessica Weisz.</I></P><P>Notes</P><OL><LI> The survey was conducted in Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

According to a</SPAN><A href=""http://www.motortrend.com/news/study-millennials-now-love-big-suvs-suburbs/""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">survey from Ford</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">, older millennials actually prefer medium and large SUVs over smaller vehicles like compact and mid-sized sedans.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">The mainstream media constantly boasts that millennials are greener than Kermit the Frog, backing up their claims with university polls. One</SPAN><A href=""https://news.utexas.edu/2016/10/27/millennials-views-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change-could-impact-election""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">UT Austin poll,</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400""> for example, estimated that 91 percent of those under age 35 say <mark>climate change</mark> is occurring. Another</SPAN><A href=""http://iop.harvard.edu/iop-now/millennials-global-warming""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">poll from the Harvard Institute of Politics</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400""> found that three in four millennials believe global warming is fact. Some have even speculated that</SPAN><A href=""http://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2017/01/26/<mark>climate</mark>-trump-millennials-miles-howard""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">environmental issues have pushed millennials</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400""> to become politically active against President Donald Trump.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">Despite these claims, millennials are always more complicated than the mainstream media makes them out to be. The millennial American Dream was delayed by the slow economic recovery under the Obama administration, and now they want their piece of the pie.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">After suffering through years of lackluster opportunities and college debt, older millennials are finally starting to settle down, get married, and make some babies.

hidden subsidies, but TMC public records offer a credible estimate.  In 2006, the <A href=""http://www.toyota.com"" class=""style6"">Toyota website</A> reported a company investment of $780.2 million in the TMMTX plant which was valued at $1.23 billion on their books —<EM>this corporate disclosure indicates that public funds and assets transferred to TMC account for close to 40 percent of the total capital investment in the Texas auto plant!</EM></P><P>Since the tax abatements are ongoing and renewable, the ultimate long range cost of the TMMTX deal to the community is inestimable.</P><P>Officials of the state of Texas justify the giveaway of public monies to corporations by citing the number of new jobs and general economic stimulus created by the businesses that receive the funds (<A href=""http://www.governor.state.tx.us"" class=""style6"">www.governor.state.tx.us</A>).  However, to understand the overall impact of globalization projects like TMMTX it is necessary to examine the assembly plant as a link in an international production chain and assess the wider impact of the chain on working people, their communities, and the global environment.</P><P><STRONG>TMMTX Operations: A Link in a Global Production Chain</STRONG></P><P>The TMMTX assembly plant is the focal point of a complex production chain that extends thousands of miles and has links to mines and manufacturing plants in the Far East, Mexico, and the southern U.S.  It also has technological links to locations in Japan and the U.S. Midwest to access product engineering, production control, etc.  The assembly plant is also the hub of an extensive transcontinental and export transportation network.</P><P>The strategic geographic location of TMMTX provides the company direct access to the low-cost south Texas labor market for assembly workers while insuring just-in-time delivery of cut-rate parts manufactured in the Far East and Mexico and subassemblies from other southern U.S. plants and providing convenient access to the U.S. auto market.</P><P>The production end of the chain concretely illustrates the driving force of globalization — to maximize profits by lowering labor costs.  The relative cost of labor is the primary determinant in the location of every link in the chain.  As many manufacturing operations as possible are completed in offshore labor markets, while the final assembly of the vehicles is conducted using some of the cheapest labor available in the U.S.  Furthermore, the extensive use of automation technology in the TMMTX plant keeps the use of local labor to a minimum.</P><P>Promoters of globalization tout the Tundra production chain as a paradigm of efficiency and a compelling argument for this latest manifestation of mega-capitalism.  However, the efficiency of global manufacturing, like any other capitalist enterprise, is measured by a single criterion — the revenue it produces for stockholders.  Any analysis which takes the overall impact of globalization into account leads to a far different conclusion.</P><P>The impact of globalization on the corporation itself is a good starting point for such an investigation.</P><P><STRONG>Impact I: The Corporation </STRONG></P><P>TMC advertises its production operations as the most efficient in the auto industry and describes its system as “lean manufacturing.”  Lean manufacturing is defined as “the production of the maximum number of sellable products or services at the lowest operational cost.”  The system stresses teamwork, flexibility, and constant evaluation in order to maximize “throughput,” the rate at which the system generates revenue through sales.  According to the corporation, the success of Toyota, including TMMTX, is the direct result of lean manufacturing.</P><P><EM>The case study of TMMTX exposes the myth of lean manufacturing.  Looking beyond the corporate rhetoric at the actual establishment and operation of TMMTX indicates that the extensive exploitation of cheap labor, both on- and offshore, and the substantial reduction of operational costs through state and local subsidies and tax abatements boost company revenues far more than the manufacturing practices in the plant, no matter how efficient they actually might be.</EM></P><P>There is no doubt that globalization has benefited TMC at TMMTX and its other subsidiaries — the corporation reported profits of more than $15 billion worldwide in 2007 and anticipates continuing growth and increasing profits.  The phenomenal “throughput” and profits of Toyota, however, must be measured against the impact of globalization on working people, their communities, and the environment.</P><P><STRONG>Impact II: Labor</STRONG></P><P>The success of globalization has clearly been at the expense of working people in North America and around the world.  The imperative of globalization to exploit cheap labor markets has created conditions that are undermining labor on two distinct levels: first, by creating competition for work <EM>between</EM> the workers of different regional labor markets; and second, by stratifying workers <EM>within</EM> regional labor markets.</P><P>The case study of TMMTX demonstrates the partition of labor on both levels.</P><P>Chart 1 reports auto industry production wages in the United States and Mexico and depicts the globalized context in which TMMTX operates.</P><P>The regional disparity of wages depicted in chart 1 is stark.  Midwestern U.S. assembly workers currently receive the top wages in the industry at an average of $26/hour.  The sliding globalized pay scale is step — the average pay of southern U.S. assembly workers is $13.25/hour, slightly over half (51 percent) of the wages of workers in the Midwest.  Mexican auto assemblers are at the bottom of the tiered labor market, making an average of $3.25/hour, a paltry 13 percent of the wages of their counterparts in the Midwest and less than 25 percent of assembly wages in the southern U.S.</P><P>Chart 1 also shows that the average wages of parts workers is about one half that of assembly workers in both countries.  Mexican parts workers, making an average $1.75/hour, receive the lowest wages in the globalized North American industry, a mere 16 percent of the wages of parts workers in the Midwest ($11/hour).</P><P>The absence of a category for southern U.S. parts manufacturing in chart 1 is accounted for by the fact that southern U.S. plants, including TMMTX, rely primarily on Mexican factories for the bulk of their parts (see map 1).  The proximity of this source of cheap auto parts is, in fact, a chief consideration in the location of new assembly plants.</P><P><EM>Chart 1 documents the primary drive behind the globalization of the North American auto industry and its southward migration — the relentless pursuit of cheap wages.</EM></P><P>Relocation of manufacturing plants (and threats of relocation), the backbone of capital’s strategy against labor in North America for the last 60 years, has now been fully realized through various globalization schemes and agreements like the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which offers multinational corporations virtually unrestricted access to national and regional labor markets.</P><P>While pitting the workers of different regions against each other has been a boon to automakers, overall it has been an unmitigated disaster for labor.  The impact of the globalization of the North American auto industry on labor in the Midwest has been devastating and includes the following consequences:</P><UL><LI><EM>The decimation of the United Auto Workers (UAW), formerly one on the strongest unions in North America.</EM></LI><LI><EM>Declining auto industry employment in the Midwest</EM><EM>and Canada</EM>. </LI><LI><EM>Continuing reduction of wages, benefits, and working conditions in the Midwest under the threat of further offshoring</EM>. </LI><LI><EM>Deteriorating economic welfare and security for all workers in the Midwest</EM>.</LI></UL><P>Though the impact of globalization on the traditional manufacturing regions is well documented (see “Globalization Now: The North American Auto Industry Goes South” at http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/vogel161007.html), successful confrontation with the system also requires recognition of the divisive impact of globalization <EM>within</EM> regional labor markets.</P><P>On the regional level, multinational corporations maintain control of labor markets primarily through the payment of carefully calculated <EM>surwages </EM>(wages significantly higher than average local wages but well below wages established by collective bargaining) that allow companies to manage regional wage rates and subvert attempts to unionize individual plants and entire regions.</P><P>Again, the case study of TMMTX supplies a concrete example of how this aspect of globalization works.</P><P>Chart 2 illustrates the TMMTX surwage in 2006.</P><P>Chart 2 compares the surwage paid by TMMTX to both the union assembly wage (for comparison) and the prevailing manufacturing wage paid in the San Antonio metropolitan area.   In 2006, the starting hourly wage of a TMMTX assembly line worker was $15.25/hour, a full 25 percent greater than the average local manufacturing wage ($11.55/hour).  These regional wage levels produced annual incomes of $31,720 versus $24,024/year.</P><P>The effects of the surwages on living standards in depressed labor markets are dramatic.  The fact that the poverty threshold for a family of four in the U.S. was $20,614 in 2006 puts the San Antonio wage profile in chart 2 into perspective.  $7,700/year at the bottom end of the income scale is very significant.  With the additional earnings, a working family could afford better food and healthcare.  It can also make the difference between living in a house versus an apartment, or of driving a decent car instead of a junker.</P><P>The divisive psychological effects of surwages on workers in the same plant or community are also significant.  Employees receiving surwages know that that they are in a privileged position and are put on the defensive, while those who work for less are resentful.  The partition of the working community through the strategy of paying surwages is very effective — union organizing appears as an unjustifiable risk for one side and seems futile for the other.  The abject failure of union initiatives at TMMTX (as well as other plants in the southern auto plant corridor on both sides of the border) testifies to the efficacy of the surwage strategy.</P><P>The surwage strategy has been so successful for Toyota that it is now an essential element of corporate policy.  In a five-year planning document that was leaked to the public in early 2007, the president of TEMA reiterated the company’s surwage policy and emphasized its importance for the future profitability and growth of Toyota in North America.  </P><P>Two major aspects of the impact of globalization on labor, both concretely illustrated by the TMMTX case study, can be summarized at this point:</P><UL><LI><EM>The relentless pursuit of cheap labor, which has produced mass economic displacement and <mark>devastation</mark> for working people and their communities, is the driving force behind globalization </EM>(illustrated in chart 1).  <EM>This trend </EM>(documented in map 1) <EM>clearly could not have been initiated and cannot be sustained without the collaboration of the state</EM> (shown in table 1)<EM>.</EM></LI><LI><EM>Multinational corporations maintain control of wages in regional labor markets through the payment of surwages that subvert unionization and help maintain low regional labor costs</EM> (profiled in chart 2)<EM>.  This control of regional wages, also aided and abetted by the state through anti-labor legislation, etc., is a key factor in the survival and expansion of globalization.</EM></LI></UL><P>Beyond the direct effects on workers highlighted above are the broader impacts of globalization on host communities.  Again, TMMTX provides clear examples.</P><P><STRONG>Impact III: The Community</STRONG></P><P>The economic impact of TMMTX on the community of south San Antonio parallels the impact on labor — while select individuals and groups clearly benefit from the presence of the plant in the area, the community at large is losing.  The impact on the community is most clearly seen in the area of public education.</P><P>The loss of local community educational funds is a direct consequence of the tax abatements and diversion of public funds that were included in the incentive package granted to Toyota in 2003 (see table 1).  Even before the TMMTX plant went online, the influx of new employees and their families into the community imposed increased demands on the local school district.  A financial crisis emerged less than a year after the opening of the plant.</P><P>In 2007, the Southwest Independent School District (SWISD) which depends on local taxes for most of its operating funds challenged the $700 million dollar tax valuation on the $1.2 billion Toyota plant claiming a significant loss of revenue.  On the same day that SWISD filed their challenge with the Bexar County Appraisal District (BAD) Toyota lawyers appeared before the BAD panel and also challenged the $700 million valuation, arguing that it should be <EM>lowered</EM> (to $300 million according to reports in the <EM>San Antonio Express-News</EM>).</P><P>The matter was settled when Toyota threatened to take BAD to court.  The settlement testifies to the power of multinational corporations to influence local governments: BAD reduced the valuation of the TMMTX plant $73 million to $627 million.  About the same time the state of Texas granted Toyota still another tax break for installing <mark>pollution</mark> control equipment that reduced the valuation by another $52 million to $575 million.</P><P>Because of the revaluation and tax abatements included in the original incentive package, SWISD received only $2.86 million in school taxes from Toyota for 2007.  That figure will be reduced by over two-thirds in 2008 and subsequent years because the 2007 tax bill included a one-time $2 million payment that was part of the original tax agreement.</P><P>In the long run, the children and families of the SWISD will receive little, if any, social benefit from TMMTX being located in their community.  The tax abatements granted to TMMTX and the company’s refusal to do its share to support local education stands in stark contrast to the millions of dollars of public funds that the corporation received from all levels of government to train TMMTX workers before the plant opened (see table 1).</P><P>The presence of TMMTX in south San Antonio has had similar impact on the entire spectrum of the social infrastructure of the community from healthcare to housing.  However, a comprehensive accounting of community impact is beyond the scope of this study.</P><P>An overview of the environmental impact of the Toyota Tundra production chain rounds out the picture of the overall consequences of globalization.</P><P><STRONG>Impact IV: The Environment</STRONG></P><P>The case study of TMMTX also illustrates how globalization contributes significantly to mounting environmental damage.  While TMMTX has been recognized (and further subsidized) by the state of Texas for being an environmentally responsible manufacturing plant, map 2 reveals that most of the Tundra production chain operates beyond the jurisdiction of any effective environmental protection agency, and, on the global level, Toyota worldwide operations contribute significantly to two environmentally ruinous trends.</P><P>First, globalization allows the externalization of industrial <mark>pollution</mark> by locating dirty manufacturing processes in countries with no environmental restrictions or lax enforcement of existing laws.  Thus, while the Toyota assembly plant qualifies for tax breaks from the state of Texas for the installation of the latest <mark>pollution</mark> control equipment, it is utilizing parts and materials produced offshore under unregulated conditions.  Auto batteries manufactured in Mexico and steel products mined and fabricated in the Far East are but two examples.</P><P>The second trend of environmental damage exacerbated by globalization is shipping industry <mark>pollution</mark>, a largely hidden but burgeoning source of dangerous atmospheric contamination.  The tonnage of cargo transported by water has tripled since 1970, and, presently, ships carry more than 90 percent of the world’s commodities.  According to the International Council on Clean Transportation, ships release more sulfur dioxide, a sooty pollutant associated with acid rain, into the air than all of the world’s cars, trucks, and busses combined, and the American Chemical Society estimates that air <mark>pollution</mark> from the shipping industry is causing 60,000 cardiopulmonary and lung-cancer deaths annually.  The EPA predicts that, at the current rate of growth of the shipping industry, oceangoing ships will generate 53 percent of the particulates, 46 percent of the nitrous oxides, and more that 94 percent of the sulfur oxides emitted by all forms of transportation in the U.S. by 2030.</P><P>It is manifestly obvious that TMC’s extensive international production chains (and all global production chains) add to the expanding shipping industry <mark>pollution</mark> that is contributing to global environmental damage and <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P align=""center"">__________</P><P><STRONG>Globalization:  The Nexus of the Megatrends </STRONG></P><P>The case study of TMMTX presents detailed concrete examples of how globalization schemes work and highlights the connections between the three megatrends of the modern world: ever expanding global production chains compound the ongoing catastrophic damage to the global environment and contribute to regional and global inequality, conditions that inevitably intensify both domestic and international political conflict.</P><P>The case study of TMMTX also exposes the essential political nature of the problem of globalization.  Examining the establishment and operation of TMMTX shows that globalization is not a product of mystical “free market” forces but the end result of active collaboration between multinational corporations and the state.</P><P>The political implications of the study of globalization are clear — globalization will have to be confronted and dismantled the same way that it was enabled — through organized and relentless ideological and political action at all levels of government from the local to the international. </P><P>Confronting globalization is a daunting task but cannot be avoided.  This challenge, the primary political contest of the 21th century, can only be initiated by working people who understand the implications of the global megatrends, but it will not be successful without the support of a broad-based coalition of committed people.</P><P>If we fail to act the whole world faces a precarious future.</P><P align=""center""> </P><P class=""style7""><A href=""#_ednref1"" name=""_edn1"" class=""style12"">1</A>   Definitive and credible analysis of

Many experts doubt that target can be met.</P><P>The environmental council, which is the state's environmental watchdog, recently reported that Connecticut's overall air quality was &quot;better in 2016, on average, than in any recent year.&quot; But state experts say increasing gas consumption, warmer summers due to <mark>climate change</mark> and fears about <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/us/politics/donald-trump-global-warming-energy-policy.html"">President Donald Trump's pro-coal and oil policies </A>are raising serious concerns about the future.</P><P><mark>Pollution</mark> drifting into Connecticut from old coal- and oil-fired power plants in the South and Midwest continue to be a major air quality problem. The<A href=""http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-ct-sues-epa-on-<mark>pollution</mark>-20170517-story.html""> state last week filed a federal lawsuit </A>against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to force the cleanup of a coal-burning power generating facility in Pennsylvania.</P><P>But gas-powered cars, trucks, lawn mowers and other equipment are the largest Connecticut-produced source of greenhouse gases and a major reason for Connecticut's sometimes lousy air quality, according to state environmental officials.</P><P>&quot;I would be concerned about any trend showing an increase in fuel use in the transportation sector,&quot; said Paul Ferrell, an assistant director of the state bureau in charge of improving Connecticut's air quality.</P><P>In 2016, there were 31 days in Connecticut when the air quality was bad enough to be listed as &quot;unhealthful air days&quot; by state agencies. No other state in New England had more than 11 unhealthy air days, according to the Council on Environmental Quality.</P><P>Just last week, Connecticut officials issued the first &quot;Unhealthy For Sensitive Groups&quot; air <mark>pollution</mark> alert of the year because of the unusually high heat.</P><P>The New York University study also estimated that ozone and particulate <mark>pollution</mark> is sending an average of 472 people in the state to hospitals and doctors annually for health problems that include heart attacks and bronchitis.</P><P><A href=""http://health.usnews.com/doctors/david-hill-514527"">Dr. David Hill, a pulmonologist </A>and a member of the American Lung Association's Connecticut leadership board, said he believes the study's conclusion about the number of people in the state who seek medical attention as a result of air <mark>pollution</mark>-related issues &quot;is probably an underestimate.&quot; He said his office's waiting room fills up fast with patients on bad air days.</P><P>Experts say Connecticut's air is considerably better than a decade ago. But the fear is that increasing temperatures resulting from <mark>climate change</mark> and the trend toward higher consumption of gasoline could combine to put a halt to any improvements in air quality and possibly lead to a decline in healthy air.</P><P>Hill said Connecticut's air quality isn't just an issue for kids, the elderly and people in bad health. He said even athletes who exercise outdoor on high-ozone days &quot;put themselves at risk … The worse the air quality gets, the worse it is for everyone.&quot;</P><P>Ozone <mark>pollution</mark> is created when nitrogen oxides – largely from motor vehicle emissions – and organic compounds react in the presence of sunlight. Heat also increases the <mark>pollution</mark>, and global warming made 2016 one of Connecticut's hottest years on record.</P><P>&quot;We have an ozone problem in Connecticut,&quot; Farrell said. He added that 67 percent of all nitrogen oxide emissions in the state come from cars, trucks, lawn mowers and other off-road gas-burning equipment.</P><P>Despite overall air quality improvements in recent years, Connecticut continues to have some of the worst ozone <mark>pollution</mark> in the Northeast.</P><P>&quot;I tell people [the effect of breathing ozone <mark>pollution</mark>] is like getting a sunburn on your lungs,&quot; Farrell said.</P></DIV><DIV class=""trb_ar_page"" data-role=""pagination_page"" data-content-page=""2""><P>The <A href=""http://www.lung.org/assets/documents/healthy-air/state-of-the-air/sota-2016-full.pdf"">American Lung Association's annual &quot;State of the Air&quot; report </A>for 2016 warned that &quot;Fairfield County remains ranked as the most polluted county in Connecticut and the most polluted county in the entire New York-Newark metro area for ozone <mark>pollution</mark>.&quot;</P><P>But the association's report gave every county in Connecticut a grade of F for ozone <mark>pollution</mark> in 2016, and showed no improvement over 2015.</P><P>Jeff Seyler, president and CEO of the American Lung Association's northeastern chapter, said those ozone levels put Connecticut residents &quot;at risk for premature death and other serious health effects such as asthma attacks and cardiovascular harm.&quot;</P><ASIDE class=""trb_em trb_embed  trb_filmstrip trb_filmstrip_list_item"" data-content-embedlocation=""Embed + (2)"" data-content-id=""83677069"" data-content-size=""large"" data-content-type=""gallery"" data-content-slug=""hc-courant-originals-video-playlist"" data-content-subtype=""premiumvideoplaylist"" data-role=""sc_item base_expandable carousel gallery_container imgsize_ratiosizecontainer delayload lightbox_container"" data-state="""" data-carousel-options=""moveby=1&amp;filmstrip&amp;resize&amp;transform"" data-embed-id=""83677069""><DIV class=""trb_filmstrip_related_panel"" data-role=""carousel_videopanel multimedia_videoloaded mediamanager_playlistvideo""><ASIDE class=""trb_em trb_embed "" data-content-embedlocation=""Embed + (2)"" data-content-id=""96742261"" data-content-size=""large"" data-content-type=""video"" data-content-slug=""hc-meriden-train-station-ceremony-20180419"" data-content-subtype=""premiumvideo"" data-role=""sc_item  mediamanager_container  mediamanager_playlistvideo  "" data-state=""carousel_activepage""><DIV class=""trb_em_m""><DIV class=""trb_em_r"" data-role=""gallery_item lightbox_metadata"" data-pagenumber=""1"" data-pagecount=""901""><SPAN class=""trb_em_r_gtc"" data-role=""base_expander"">CAPTION</SPAN><DIV class=""trb_em_r_ca""><P>Connecticut Department of Transportation Commissioner James P.

But whether that will lead to a less-congested transportation system—saving fuel and cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions—remains to be seen, according to be transportation experts.</P><P>“The impact can be dramatic, but there remains a lot of uncertainty about it,” said Jeffrey Gonder, a researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado. “There needs to be further research to try to more intelligently understand where are the key tipping points in the evolution of the technology, so we can help encourage the beneficial impacts and mitigate the negative impacts.”</P><P>The plan comes on the heels of President Obama’s call in his State of the Union address to reduce emissions in a “21st-century transportation system.” The sector’s <mark>carbon</mark> footprint is second only to the power sector, contributing around 27 percent of overall emissions in the United States in 2013, according to U.S. EPA.</P><P>Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx announced Thursday the president’s upcoming fiscal 2017 budget proposal would include $3.9 billion over 10 years for automated cars. The money would go to testing self-driving cars and other connected vehicle systems in designated corridors around the country (<A href=""https://www.eenews.net/eenewspm/stories/1060030650"" target=""_blank""><EM>Greenwire</EM></A>, Jan. 14).</P><P>“We are on the cusp of a new era in automotive technology with enormous potential to save lives, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transform mobility for the American people,” Foxx said at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. “Today’s actions and those we will pursue in the coming months will provide the foundation and the path forward for manufacturers, state officials and consumers to use new technologies and achieve their full safety potential.”</P><P>Safety grabbed the spotlight. Foxx also described a series of initiatives aimed at making sure government regulations kept up with the technology. He promised an <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/assets/2016/01/14/document_pm_01.pdf"" target=""_blank"">update</A> to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s 2013 preliminary policy statement on autonomous vehicles within six months that recognizes the progress the technology has made in the past three years.</P><P>But reducing emissions from the transportation sector is an increasingly important theme for Obama as he works to build a legacy of <mark>climate change</mark> action. Last December, the Department of Transportation launched a Smart City competition asking municipalities to submit plans integrating technology <mark>innovation</mark>s to help ease traffic and reduce greenhouse gases.</P><P><STRONG>Lots of theories, not much practice</STRONG>
Transportation experts have long modeled the many hypothetical ways in which connected, intelligent or driverless vehicles might cut back on fuel. Cars that talk to each other can flow right by each other at intersections, avoiding stopping and starting. Smart routing systems can make moving around more efficient, reducing congestion. Vehicles driving directly behind one another because their systems are linked might reduce air drag, a phenomenon called “platooning.”</P><P>When combined with other <mark>innovation</mark>s in transportation, the benefits can be even greater, researchers suggested. Driverless taxis gained more attention when General Motors Co. in early January made a $500 million investment in the ride-sharing company Lyft to develop a network of autonomous, on-demand vehicles.</P><P>“The idea of automated car-sharing vehicle or a ride-sharing service, when you increase the occupancy of a vehicle, the emissions and fuel use overall are going to be split over those individuals, hence they are going to be lower,” said Susan Shaheen, the co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, whose research focuses on car-sharing.</P><P>Another proposal would combine automation and electric cars. A <EM>Nature <mark>Climate Change</mark></EM> study last year estimated that emissions per mile from light-duty vehicles could fall by as much as 94 percent by 2030 in a “best-case scenario” of electric driverless taxis (<A href=""https://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/stories/1060021326"" target=""_blank""><EM><mark>Climate</mark>Wire</EM></A>, July 7, 2015).</P><P>“Autonomous vehicles can accelerate or enable the greater use of electric,” said Jeffery Greenblatt, a co-author of the study and an energy researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. “Especially with a car that’s providing rides to others, the vehicle itself can take care of battery recharging, which makes owning an electric car a lot easier. And because these cars would be used five to six times as often as gas-powered vehicles, you pay off the upfront cost more quickly.”</P><P>But an automated transportation might increase fuel use, too, he warned. Driverless technology might get people who don’t usually drive in gas-guzzling vehicles. Trips may get longer if people use automated cars as mobile offices.</P><P>The pilot programs floated by the Department of Transportation funding will be particularly important in figuring out how humans actually react to the technology, said Gonder, from the NREL.</P><P>“Without the technologies out there and people interacting with them, it’s really just speculation and relying on surveys,” Gondor said. “That type of real world experience would really help to get a better understanding to reduce these uncertainties around making predictions for individual behaviors.”</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>wire with permission from Environment &amp; Energy Publishing, LLC. <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/"" target=""_blank"">www.eenews.net</A>, 202-628-6500</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Consider Kevin Butt, <A href=""http://toyotanews.pressroom.toyota.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2195"">regional environmental sustainability director</A> for Toyota Motor North America, and his charge to take the company “beyond zero environmental impact” by reducing and eventually eliminating CO₂ emissions from vehicle operation, manufacturing, materials production and energy sources by 2050.</P><P>This type of effort is not as crazy as it may seem. Solutions to <mark>climate change</mark> require new types of aggressive thinking. While <A href=""http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php"">global treaties</A> to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are important, they are not enough. Eventually society has to go <mark>carbon</mark> neutral, and then it has to go <A href=""http://energy.umich.edu/research/projects/beyond-<mark>carbon</mark>-neutral""><mark>carbon</mark> negative</A>.</P><P>The ultimate responsibility for making this shift is falling first and foremost on business. Companies are developing the next buildings we live and work in, the clothes we wear, the food we eat, the forms of mobility we employ and the energy systems that propel them. With their unmatched powers of ideation, production and distribution, business is the only entity that can bring the change we need. Indeed, if there are no solutions coming from the business world, there will be no solutions at the necessary scale. </P><P>While business has been addressing sustainability challenges <A href=""http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=3692"">since the 1990s</A>, and <mark>climate change</mark> since the 2000s, the focus of this effort is now at an inflection point, as Toyota’s “beyond zero impact” effort shows. Rather than looking to government for solutions, many businesses are taking responsibility for <mark>climate change</mark> seriously and changing the system on their own. </P><H2>Business sustainability 1.0: Enterprise integration</H2><P>Over the past quarter-century, companies have framed environmental sustainability as a market shift that fits into the existing ways of managing a business, an approach that we at the <A href=""http://erb.umich.edu/"">Erb Institute</A> call Enterprise Integration. The notion is that <A href=""https://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Environmental-Strategy-Changing-Landscape/dp/1559637722"">key business constituents</A> bring sustainability to the business through existing corporate functions, thereby making it a strategic concern. </P><P>For example, <A href=""http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/ajhoff/books/2006%20Pew%20Report.pdf"">Whirlpool</A> is innovating on appliance energy efficiency, not because of corporate social responsibility, but because it has watched energy efficiency move from number 10 or 12 in consumer priorities in the 1980s to number three, behind cost and performance. And it expects those concerns will continue to grow. Similarly, most auto companies are moving into hybrid and electric drivetrains because they see electrification as the <A href=""http://www.aol.com/article/2012/01/26/how-the-chevy-volt-became-a-political-punching-bag/20157651/"">future of the sector</A>. </P><FIGURE class=""align-center zoomable""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">Like Toyota and its hybrid Prius program, GM invested in electric cars such as the Chevy Volt (seen here in production) to be part of the auto industry’s move to electrification, not solely to meet government mandates.</SPAN><SPAN class=""attribution""><A class=""source"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/wiredphotostream/6302997579/in/photolist-aAYvA4-7ByCq8-6SbjWB-7ByCyk-9BZ8zC-7QscM4-aPgj5z-8fchRD-7x4DAf-7nXcqc-amUT74-amXrZd-5PX9GZ-8fcfRr-aEJnyj-ebVZSf-aEJmkw-aEEwLB-aEExAv-aEEvnV-9R27c2-yGSo6-4nj4Tz-cXmTxb-99JTzb-7A6YR1-7M1N7n-8hm4MK-9BWrSz-97MNdw-9BWrzB-7M5Lmh-ajT1qY-dxZFY3-7Le1P2-cXmTAL-ajQbyv-b76tU2-amXFxQ-amUDNn-6e5MXH-cXmTz3-ajT7jL-4zqdYA-6fcF7V-7M5LdQ-6Sfqh3-9pDB6N-bW3MrH-7oxrqX"">Jim Merithew/Wired.com</A>, <A class=""license"" href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"">CC BY-NC</A></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>To make the business case, companies turn to traditional sources and motivations. Once insurance companies apply sustainability pressures on the business, the issue becomes one of risk management. From competitors, it becomes an issue of strategic direction. From investors and banks, it becomes an issue of capital acquisition and cost of capital. From suppliers and buyers, it becomes an issue of supply chain logistics. From consumers, it becomes an issue of market demand.  </P><P>Put in such terms, much of the specific language of sustainability recedes, being replaced by the core language of standard business strategy. As such, companies can remain agnostic about the science of particular issues (such as <mark>climate change</mark>) but still recognize their importance as business concerns. In doing so, they are turning the false dichotomy between the economy and the environment on its head.</P><P>Indeed, recent surveys show that <A href=""http://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/sustainabilitys-next-frontier/"">85 percent</A> of business executives believe that <mark>climate change</mark> is real (well above the national average of <A href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/190010/concern-global-warming-eight-year-high.aspx"">64 percent</A>) and more than <A href=""https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/news_events/8.1/UNGC_Accenture_CEO_Study_2010.pdf"">90 percent</A> of CEOs believe that sustainability in general is important to a company’s profits. This leads more businesses to develop sustainability strategies, create positions like <A href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/hbsworkingknowledge/2014/10/08/what-do-chief-sustainabilty-officers-do/#5ebdb2ef1a96"">chief sustainability officer</A> to carry them out and publish <A href=""https://www.globalreporting.org/Pages/default.aspx"">annual reports</A> on sustainability to track and share the results. This is the first model of business sustainability and it would seem to be setting us on a path to becoming more <mark>sustainable</mark>.</P><P>But, not so fast.</P><P>As promising as these developments are, our world continues to become less, not more, <mark>sustainable</mark>, and the nature of the problems we face are markedly different than they were in the 1990s. To mark this shift, scientists have proposed that we have left the Holocene and entered the <A href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v415/n6867/full/415023a.html"">Anthropocene</A>, a new geologic epoch that acknowledges that humans are now a <A href=""https://theconversation.com/an-official-welcome-to-the-anthropocene-epoch-but-who-gets-to-decide-its-here-57113"">significant operating force within the Earth’s ecosystems</A>. </P><P>Recognition of the Anthropocene has broad implications for how we think about business sustainability. Rather than fitting sustainability into the existing models of the market, we must now recognize that the market is taking control of natural systems with potentially catastrophic consequences. <mark>Climate change</mark>, ozone depletion, droughts, wildfires, food insecurity, water scarcity and the social unrest that results all point to a fundamental system failure created by our market (and political) institutions. </P><P>As a result, the first phase of business sustainability – integrating these practices within core corporate functions –  is inadequate for the scope of the issues we now face. Using this model, we are slowing the velocity at which we are approaching a <A href=""https://theconversation.com/to-manage-earth-in-the-anthropocene-we-need-to-focus-on-systems-change-38452"">system collapse</A>, but we are not averting that eventual outcome. A new model of thinking is emerging. </P><H2>Sustainability 2.0: Market transformation</H2><P>The next mode of business sustainability, which we call market transformation, involves corporations making <A href=""http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300158434/sustainability-design"">systemic changes</A> in the business environment. It sees the corporation as a positive force in society, ameliorating our legacy of harm and mitigating the impacts from a global population expected to reach nine billion by 2050. </P><P>We can already see some of the <A href=""https://theconversation.com/capitalism-must-evolve-to-solve-the-<mark>climate</mark>-crisis-47338"">elements of this shift</A> coming into view. Here are some core tenets of this change to creating sustainability: </P><UL><LI><P>Focus on the <A href=""http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=22399"">system</A>. The notion of an energy company installing a windfarm and calling itself <mark>sustainable</mark> makes no empirical sense. A more <mark>sustainable</mark> energy system incorporates the whole grid, encompassing generation, transmission, distribution, use and mobility. <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/technology/google-says-it-will-run-entirely-on-renewable-energy-in-2017.html"">Google</A>, for example, plans to run all of its data centers entirely from renewable energy by 2017.  This goes far beyond a token commitment, creating a hedge against <A href=""https://www.ceres.org/resources/reports/power-forward-why-the-world2019s-largest-companies-are-investing-in-renewable-energy/view"">future energy volatility</A> by changing the overall energy system on which the company depends.</P></LI><LI><P>Involve the entire supply chain. Systemic approaches to business sustainability require a broader consideration of operations and supply chain logistics, using concepts such as <A href=""http://css.snre.umich.edu/"">life cycle analysis</A>, <A href=""http://cie.research.yale.edu/"">industrial ecology</A> and the <A href=""https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy/overview/concept"">circular economy</A> to reduce material and energy use among all the constituents in the supply chain.</P></LI><LI><P>The government as collaborator. Since the days of Adam Smith, government has been the <A href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602490/capitalism-behaving-badly/"">arbiter of the market</A>, helping to set the rules in the service of humans and adapting to changes as needed. You can’t price-fix, you can’t collude, you can’t sell drugs; we accept these as rules of the market. In the future, the market will restrict (or eliminate) the emission of greenhouse gases as a way to promote economic growth, not hinder it. Forward-thinking companies seek ways to constructively participate in policy formation.</P></LI><LI><P>Questioning our standard models and metrics. Ultimately, market transformation is prompting a reexamination of the models now used to understand and explain the market, such as <A href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/long-term-capitalism/redefining-capitalism"">neoclassical economics</A> and <A href=""https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-problem-of-corporate-purpose/"">principal-agent theory</A>. Both of these are built on rather dismal simplifications of human beings as largely untrustworthy and driven by avarice, greed and short-term thinking. Anyone in business will tell you that their motivations and resultant strategies are far more complex. For example, some, like former GE CEO Jack Welch, are questioning the assumption that <A href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2013/06/26/the-origin-of-the-worlds-dumbest-idea-milton-friedman/#205a8e58214c"">the singular purpose of the corporation</A> is to make money for its shareholders.  </P></LI><LI><P>As these models are questioned, new ones are emerging, from <A href=""http://capitalinstitute.org/regenerative-capitalism/"">regenerative capitalism</A> to <A href=""http://www.collaborativeconsumption.com/"">collaborative consumption</A>, from <A href=""http://www.conflictfreesourcing.org/"">conflict-free sourcing</A> to the <A href=""http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21573104-internet-everything-hire-rise-sharing-economy"">sharing economy</A>.</P></LI></UL><H2>Different from the Reagan years</H2><P>These are just some of the emergent notions of a new framework for corporate sustainability. Companies are altering the systems in which they operate, driving entire industries toward a set of market rules that bring us toward a <mark>sustainable</mark> future. </P><P>So, while President-elect Trump’s approach to the EPA bears similarities to <A href=""https://theconversation.com/<mark>climate</mark>-change-and-the-presidential-race-lessons-from-the-reagan-years-66194"">President Reagan</A>‘s attempts to roll back environmental regulations in the 1980s, and likely faces a similar backlash, there is one big difference; some of that backlash will come from businesses who are leading on greenhouse gas reductions and renewable energy and not fighting government-led environmental policies as they did in the 1980s. To get a sense of the shifting economic landscape, <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-25/clean-energy-jobs-surpass-oil-drilling-for-first-time-in-u-s"">jobs in the clean energy sector</A> exceeded those in oil drilling for the first time in 2016 and continue to grow.  Indeed, many within these and other sectors are <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/01/<mark>climate</mark>-change-donald-trump-us-companies?CMP=share_btn_tw"">already pushing back</A> on Trump’s dismissal of <mark>climate change</mark> and continuing with strategies of their own.</P><P>They will do this with, or <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/us/politics/trump-<mark>climate</mark>-epa-coal-jobs.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news"">without</A>, the cooperation of governments and their political shifts back and forth on these critical issues. </P><P>For example, Toyota, in its effort to go <mark>carbon</mark>-neutral, must think systemically and include many partners, just as Tesla is doing as it challenges the calculus for electric cars sector-wide. To enact system-wide change, companies are also working with governments to <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/business/how-the-chemical-industry-joined-the-fight-against-<mark>climate</mark>-change.html?_r=0"">phase out heat-trapping HFC chemicals</A>, set <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/17/business/energy-environment/epa-truck-emission-standards.html"">new efficiency standards on trucks</A>, establish transparency <A href=""http://wdi-publishing.com/casedetail.aspx?cid=1429411"">rules on conflict minerals</A> or participate in negotiations on a global <mark>climate change</mark> agreement. Examples of companies doing it on their own include changes in the <A href=""http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-08-24/michelin-isnt-reinventing-wheel-its-reinventing-rubber-supply-chain"">supply chain on rubber</A> or the reduction (even elimination) of <A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/meat-companies-go-antibiotics-free-as-more-consumers-demand-it-1415071802"">antibiotics in chicken</A>.  </P><P>In each of these cases, companies are stepping into, in the words of Unilever CEO Paul Polman, “<A href=""http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/mt-interview-paul-polman-unilever/article/1055793"">a very interesting period in history</A> where the responsible business world is running ahead of the politicians” and taking on a broader role to “<A href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability-and-resource-productivity/our-insights/business-society-and-the-future-of-capitalism%20%22%22"">serve society</A>.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Toyota’s support for the IUCN Red List is the first project to preserve species to be implemented under the company’s scheme to reduce the environmental impact of automobiles, the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050.

<BODY><MAIN id=""wb-cont"" role=""main"" property=""mainContentOfPage"" class=""container""><OL><LI>Smart Grids; and,</LI><LI><mark>Carbon</mark> Capture.</LI></OL><P>CCMT technologies related to Transport are designed primarily to help reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions.  Technologies related to electric vehicles are a typical example of CCMT technologies related to Transport.  Renewable Energy includes technologies in areas such as hydro energy, wind energy, solar energy and geothermal energy.  In Buildings, emission reductions are gained through better lighting, heating, ventilation systems as well as better elevators, escalators and increased thermal performance in general.    Traditional Energy includes improvements in fossil-fuel technologies and alternatives such as nuclear energy.  Clean Energy Enablers are technologies related to energy conversion or management systems that are also designed to reduce greenhouse gases.  Technologies related to batteries are example of technologies that would fall under this category as batteries are considered an alternative to using other types of energies that are more polluting.  Smart Grids are related to the imporvement of technologies related to an electrical supply network using digital communication technology.  Using communication technologies to optimize electricity usage ultimately empowers consumers to more effictiently control energy use thereby reducing the likelihood of outages. <SUP id=""fn13-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn13""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>13</A></SUP> Finally, <mark>Carbon</mark> Capture related technologies are designed to capture waste CO<SUB>2</SUB> and other greenhouse gases and inject it into deep underground rock formations for permanent storage. <SUP id=""fn14-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn14""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>14</A></SUP></P><P>The Canadian researcher data used in this report was obtained from Antoine Dechezleprêtre, Associate Professorial Research Fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the Environment at the London School of Economics, and co-author of the UNEP and EPO report.  The analysis focuses on patent applications filed between January 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2012.  The dataset consists of 7,873 high-value invention (HVI) patent applications with at least one Canadian researcher filed over the time span translating into 2,184 HVI patent families.  A patent family represents one or more published patents related to the same invention with a shared priority.  This report uses the same fractional counting approach as in the UNEP and EPO report for assigning patented inventions to inventors in cases where multiple inventors from various countries jointly filed a patent.  Using the fractional counting approach, the 2,184 HVI patent families equates to 608 HVI patent families.  This approach uses information on the inventor's country of residence or origin to determine in which country a patented invention has been developed.  For example,  in the case where a patent is filed by a Canadian, an American, and a Japanese inventor, Canada would be assigned one third of the ownership of the patent, the United States would also retain one third of the ownership, and Japan would retain the final third of the ownership.</P><P>In addition to examining CCMT patenting activity by researchers, this report examines the CCMT patent data from the perspective of business inventive activity.  The Derwent <mark>Innovation</mark> database was used to extract patent families that were filed in more than one country and where the basic patent, or the first member of the patent family, was filed between 2008 and 2012.  We refer to these patent families as high-value inventions.  The dataset consists of 99,935 high-value inventions in CCMT.  The Canadian businesses dataset represents approximately 1%, or 1,140 high-value inventions, of the total number of patent families worlwide involved in CCMT.  This is approximately half the size of the Canadian researcher dataset.  Similar to the researcher data, the business data is limited to patent filed between January 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2012.  An absolute counting approach is used to assess the patented inventions to businesses.  The reason for not using the fractional counting approach for the business analysis is because the IP is associated with the company's country of origin based on its headquarter's location.</P><P>Time was spent treating the data to ensure that proper country codes were attributed to businesses. This is due to cases of missing address information as reported by the office where the basic patent was applied. Treatment included creating a database of business names from the dataset and attributing a country code to those businesses that were without a country code but that have already appeared somewhere in the dataset with one.  In doing so, the percentage of businesses without an address dropped from 5% to less than 1%.</P><H2 id=""toc-5"">Methodology</H2><H3>Patent analytics</H3><P>The development and adoption of new technologies are required to meet current and future environmental challenges. <SUP id=""fn15-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn15""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>15</A></SUP> Patent data is a good starting point for analysis of the development of new technologies as it provides important information on the specific <mark>innovation</mark> in the invention and who the inventors and applicant are.  Like any data source patent data has its strengths and weaknesses and if used in the wrong way it can lead to erroneous conclusions and poor policy.  The following provides context on the use of patents in understanding <mark>innovation</mark>.</P><P>While patents measure the flow of new ideas, it has been argued that patents may not measure <mark>innovation</mark> for three important reasons: patents do not include non-patented <mark>innovation</mark>s, not all patents result in commercialization, and many patents are strategic in nature. <SUP id=""fn16-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn16""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>16</A></SUP> For this reason the analysis is based on patent families that include applications in at least two jurisdictions.  This makes it more likely that these patent families will be a higher-valued invention and that the firm expects to commercialize the invention. <SUP id=""fn17-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn17""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>17</A></SUP></P><P>Another challenge presented is that many <mark>innovation</mark>s or inventions remain hidden as trade secrets.  These <mark>innovation</mark>s will be missed in a measure that includes only patents.  However, a 2008 study indicates that world-first innovators patent more frequently. Conversely, firms that patent infrequently tend to be imitators. <SUP id=""fn18-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn18""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>18</A></SUP> In addition, the study finds that firms that protect their intellectual property are more likely to increase their profits than those that do not.  In addition, SMEs that patent are more likely to be high-growth firms, which is important for success. <SUP id=""fn19-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn19""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>19</A></SUP> These conclusions are reinforced by a Canadian study that noted that firms that are aggressive innovators, introducing radically new products that involve patent protection, have higher profits. <SUP id=""fn20-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn20""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>20</A></SUP> Finally, while some inventions are not patented, patents are obtained for almost all economically significant inventions. <SUP id=""fn21-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn21""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>21</A></SUP></P><P>Below are the primary ways to view or interpret patent data:</P><DL><DT><STRONG>Market Reach</STRONG></DT><DD>Patent filings in foreign markets are a good indicator of firms accessing those markets.  Surveys have shown that firms that hold patents are more likely to be exporters <SUP id=""fn22-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn22""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>22</A></SUP> .</DD><DT><STRONG>Innovative Activity</STRONG></DT><DD>When we do not account for filings in multiple jurisdictions we are double and triple counting the number of patented inventions or innovative activities.  In order to address this patent data allows for the formation of patent families where by each family includes all related or similar patents in all jurisdictions.</DD><DT><STRONG>Scientific Strength</STRONG></DT><DD>It is possible to identify the researchers or scientists, rather than the company or applicant.  While these can be the same, they are often different.  In this way we can see the inventive activity of Canadian researchers working in other countries or for non-Canadian companies.</DD><DT><STRONG>Relative Advantage</STRONG></DT><DD>Canada is a small open-economy.  For this reason it is unlikely that our industries or innovators would have an absolute advantage in a particular area, be the most prolific IP users or have the largest global market share.  However, there are areas where we have a comparative or relative advantage.  Much work has been done in the creation of metrics of relative technological advantage and relative specialization.</DD></DL><H3>Patent families</H3><P>The analysis of businesses and institutions is based on Derwent <mark>Innovation</mark>'s patent family data. These families are defined as drawing together patents covering the same invention and their relationship is defined by the priority or application details claimed by each document.  A patent family can be tagged to multiple classifications.  For this reason, it is important to note that when we say patent, we actually mean a patent linked to the specific classification regardless of if it was tagged to another one.</P><P>Similar to the EPO report, the patent family data in this report was used to construct statistics for &quot;high-value&quot; inventions.  High-value inventions are defined as patent families that are filed in more than one jurisdiction.  Although it can be said that patents are not all of high-value, it is rare to find that a successful invention was not patented.  This idea along with our methodology for using only patent families filed in more than one jurisdiction justifies our assumption that the patents in our datasets are high-value inventions.  Although it is very difficult to quickly identify the value of patents within a large dataset, it is a safe assumption that patents filed in multiple jurisdictions are likely to be of higher value than patents filed in only one jurisdiction.  By omitting patents filed in only one jurisdiction from the dataset, it was possible to limit the dataset to high-value inventions.</P><H3>Revealed technological advantage</H3><P>In order to gain a better understanding of Canada's strengths in CCMT research, we use the Revealed Technological Advantage (RTA) index, which was developed by the OECD and uses patenting intensity to allow for industries to be compared between countries of different sizes on a relative basis.  The index is calculated as a correction for the absolute numbers of HVI patent families in order to account for the fact that some countries file more patent applications than others in all fields of technology.  In this report the RTA index is used to determine where Canadians have a comparative advantage over competitors.  This report compares Canada's RTA index for each CCMT category to that of the G7 countries along with four other countries, China, Korea, Australia and Denmark.  China and Korea are included in the comparison because they are two prolific patenting countries.   Australia is also included because of its IPO's similarities with the Canadian IPO in terms of size and activity levels.  Finally, Denmark is included because of its specialization in the area of CCMT.</P><P>The formula used to calculate the RTA is as follows:</P><DL><DT><STRONG>Numerator</STRONG></DT><DD>The sum of HVI patent families for a category (or subgroup) in Canada divided by the sum of HVI patent families for the category (or subgroup) in the world</DD><DT><STRONG>Denominator</STRONG></DT><DD>The sum of HVI patent families in Canada divided by the sum of HVI patent families in the world

When the plant opened in the 1980s, Kentucky was a cheap place to let a machine run all weekend. Workers did just that.</P><P>&quot;People were afraid to turn something off,&quot; Butt said. &quot;It's the human element, the culture. We're still working through it, making sure we're turning something off.&quot;</P><P>The discussion about electricity use continues to change at the Georgetown assembly plant. Managers say their attitude falls under the Japanese principle called <EM>kaizen</EM>, or &quot;continuous improvement.&quot; Adopting more efficient ways of using power and considering their effect on Toyota's competitiveness in North America and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions put <EM>kaizen</EM> to the test.</P><P>But today there's an additional challenge, and that's the rising cost of purchasing power from electric utilities in Kentucky and across the Midwest. Regulated electricity rates are outside of the control of Toyota employees, even as they preach careful energy management. Also outside of their control are proposed federal regulations aiming to cut power-sector <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions tied to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><ASIDE id=""image_asset_layout_9654"" class=""left span10 image_asset_layout""><P class=""caption"">At Toyota’s auto assembly plant in Georgetown, Ky., plant managers expect energy costs to go up as electric utilities retool.  <SPAN class=""credit"">Photo by Joel Kirkland.</SPAN></P></ASIDE><P>The cost of transitioning to cleaner fuels is going up in states where old, centralized power plants rely heavily on high-<mark>carbon</mark> coal. Coal generates about 90 percent of Kentucky's power.</P><P>PPL Corp.'s Kentucky Utilities, which serves Georgetown and southern Scott County around it, requested a 9.6 percent rate increase from the Public Service Commission in November. The $153 million revenue boost would help the utility handle rising capital costs.</P><P>Utility CEO Victor Staffieri cited $5.4 billion in capital costs through 2019, including firing up a natural gas generation unit and increasing capacity at a hydroelectric plant along the Ohio River that's operated by Louisville Gas &amp; Electric. LG&amp;E and KU are jointly run under the PPL umbrella of investor-owned utilities.</P><P>&quot;We all realize that the cost of energy is going to increase dramatically over time,&quot; Butt said in an interview in his quiet office a few hallways down from the busy assembly floor. &quot;That's a risk for this company.&quot;</P><H3>A nod for manufacturing</H3><SECTION class=""ad medium""><P class=""label"">Advertisement</P></SECTION><P>During visits to Washington, D.C., Kentucky officials are eager to point out that the state's manufacturers could be badly hurt by U.S. EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan. The state's industrial sector benefits from some of the lowest overall energy costs east of the Mississippi River, they've told EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy.</P><P>Those costs are going up as utilities replace old coal plants with cleaner power sources.</P><P>Kentucky has 220,000 people working in manufacturing. That spans energy-intensive aluminum smelters and the tens of thousands going to work at auto part factories or assembly plants.</P><P>The industrial sector is smaller than in Rust Belt states to the north and east, but the job numbers dwarf those employed in Kentucky coal mining. Even so, saving coal jobs has been the sole focus of a well-financed effort by Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and coal industry allies looking to kill President Obama's <mark>climate</mark> plan.</P><P>&quot;So you tell me what this is going to be about. It really is about manufacturing,&quot; Kentucky Energy and Environment Secretary Leonard Peters told <EM>EnergyWire</EM> last month, when asked about the focus of a highly charged statewide debate here about the costs of regulating <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>One of the ways to offset rising electricity costs is to use less of the commodity: Turn the lights out. Power down industrial widgets. Install rooftop solar panels that eliminate fuel costs. But Kentucky joins other states in wrestling with how exactly to incentivize electric utilities and industrial customers to work together on programs to control consumption better before costs start rising quickly.</P><P>For Toyota and other corners of the state's expanding auto industry, energy consumption can be tweaked by employing new and better technology for building cars. At a smelter or a cement factory, there's little wiggle room when so much of its raw material is the energy itself.</P><P>&quot;In Kentucky, while there's been some progress and some increased investment, as a whole it's not one of the leaders in energy efficiency,&quot; said Jill Tauber, a managing attorney for Earthjustice.</P><P>Kentucky tends to eat up more energy per unit of economic activity than other states. The industrial sector here has one of the highest energy intensity rates in the nation, according to the U.S. Energy Department, and it consumes about 45 percent of the state's total energy demand.</P><P>The Public Service Commission in Kentucky doesn't have the authority to mandate that utilities encourage residential, commercial and industrial customers to use less power. But the commission continues to bring it up in rate cases, and it's pressing the large investor-owned utilities and rural co-ops to study ways to incentivize industrial users to save energy.</P><P>Regulators here are pitching efficiency as a tool for navigating -- or surviving -- rapid changes in the power sector.</P><P>&quot;The commission continues to believe that conservation, energy efficiency and demand-side management, generally, will become increasingly important as more constraints are likely to be placed upon utilities whose main source of supply is coal-based generation,&quot; the commission said in a Jan. 16 order that grants a 2.4 percent rate increase to Cumberland Valley Electric.</P><P>The commission is pushing utilities to take more aggressive measures through what's called demand-side management, or DSM. That refers to the variety of programs and financial incentives that utilities can use to control how much energy big customers use during peak hours.</P><H3>'Lowest-<mark>carbon</mark> kilowatt'</H3><P>For utilities, the economic benefit of selling less of their product to big customers isn't obvious unless they can recover the cost of doing so through regulated rates. But efficiency is on the shortlist of tools states can use to comply with federal targets for cutting <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.</P><P>&quot;The lowest-<mark>carbon</mark> kilowatt is still the one you don't use,&quot; said Gale Boyd, an economist and director of the Triangle Research Data Center at Duke University.</P><P>&quot;That's going to require a partnership with management, and for companies to let their energy suppliers into their plants,&quot; he said. &quot;It's what successful utilities are going to do with respect to their industrial load.&quot;</P><P>In November, the commission approved an efficiency plan with plenty of cost-recovery for LG&amp;E and Kentucky Utilities through 2018. That includes energy profiles for high-consuming residential customers; the use of &quot;switches&quot; to cycle down air conditioning, heat pumps and equipment during peak hours; low-income weatherization programs; and $150 to $1,000 incentives for multi-family houses to change their consumption habits.</P><P>LG&amp;E and KU proposed a voluntary advanced metering program for a limited number of customers.</P><P>But in rolling out its plan, the utilities ran into trouble when they presented a study on what more can be done to boost energy efficiency. The study didn't include the industrial sector.</P><P>Sierra Club jumped in and asked the commission to direct the companies to study what industrial customers can do.</P><P>The PSC described the utilities' concern this way: If large energy consumers such as Toyota opted out of an industrial demand-side management and efficiency program, costs for everyone else would go up. It described a domino effect that would lead other industrial customers to opt out.</P><P>The utilities also pointed to a lack of interest in energy efficiency programs among big industrial customers, according to a 2012 survey they conducted.</P><P>&quot;The companies presented no evidence, except for the 2012 survey, to support its contention that there is no wide-scale interest in industrial DSM/EE programs,&quot; the PSC said in its November order.</P><P>The PSC ordered the utilities to commission a study of potential industrial energy efficiency.</P><H3>Cumberland rates</H3><P>States that burn a lot of cheap coal have held down regulated electricity rates for decades. Yet in a number of those states, including Kentucky, the monthly residential electric bills that land in customer mailboxes are higher than in states with more aggressive efficiency programs.</P><P>In Kentucky, West Virginia, Indiana, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina and Louisiana, average monthly residential electric bills are between $105 and $135 a month, according to 2012 data compiled by Fitch Ratings.</P><P>In California and Colorado, where rates are higher but state policies incentivize utilities to encourage energy savings, the average monthly bill was between $80 and $87.</P><P>EPA <mark>carbon</mark> regulations are expected to be finalized this summer. The transition to a power system that is ultimately cheaper and more manageable for consumers means big capital costs for utilities on the front end of what's expected to be a multi-decade process.</P><P>In the Cumberland Valley rate case in January, the PSC acknowledged that there's a need for utilities operating in poor regional economies to &quot;guard against&quot; the revenue erosion that happens when customers and sales decline. Cumberland Valley distributes power to customers across the southeastern part of Kentucky, where the population and local economies are declining. That puts both the utility and state regulators in a tough spot.</P><P>Electricity demand has remained relatively flat in recent years. And burning loads of coal to produce and sell as much electricity as possible isn't the fail-safe business model it used to be. Natural gas is priced competitively with coal, and the cost of supplementing baseload generation with zero-<mark>carbon</mark> sources such as wind and solar is coming down fast.</P><P>In Midwestern states on Kentucky's doorstep, electric transmission infrastructure is an emerging cost. In states less coal-dependent than Kentucky, interstate lines meant to build out the regional grid to tap wind power from the Great Plains and to integrate utility-scale solar power are being factored into discussions about cost control.</P><P>Back in Georgetown, Toyota has decided to take some of this into its own hands.</P><P>This spring, the plant expects to start converting methane from a local landfill into 1 megawatt of electricity, and increasing power production from there. Starting out, it's enough to power the production of about 10,000 cars.</P><P>In the meantime, Butt, the environmental manager at Toyota, says the system of capturing methane cuts about 90 percent of the landfill's greenhouse gas emissions and helps the region meet ambient air quality standards.</P><P>&quot;We'll always be on a major grid of some sort,&quot; Butt said.</P><P>Increasingly, however, there's some choice in the matter. &quot;How do we step out from where we're currently at and evaluate the next pieces of technology we could use here?&quot; Butt asked.</P><P>Toyota is looking for opportunities to couple investments in energy-cost savings and emissions reductions, he said. But he acknowledged that the goal is harder to meet for industrial plants in states like Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana, where utilities remain locked into burning coal for most of their power.</P><P>&quot;If you look at our manufacturing plant in Toronto, Canada, which is all hydropower, we don't look so good,&quot; Butt said, by comparison to the Georgetown plant's <mark>carbon</mark> footprint.</P></SECTION><SECTION class=""promo_container trial_promo""><H1>Like what you see?</H1><H2 class=""bottom_1 global_red"">Start a free trial now.</H2><P class=""bottom_1"">Get access to our comprehensive, daily coverage of energy and environmental politics and policy.</P></SECTION></SECTION></ARTICLE></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

          Sep 15, 2014        </DIV></DIV></HEADER><DIV class=""content""><DIV class=""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden""><DIV class=""field-items""><DIV class=""field-item even"" property=""content:encoded""><P>A two-year-old number is changing the way governments, companies and investors approach the fight against <mark>climate change</mark>: $1 trillion.</P><P>That is roughly the amount of additional investment needed worldwide each year for the next 36 years to stave off the worst effects of global warming and keep the Earth habitable, according to the <A href=""http://www.iea.org/"">International Energy Agency</A>. The Paris-based organization of 29 developed countries calculated the cost in 2012 and raised its estimates this year. <A href=""http://www.ceres.org/"">Ceres</A>, a Boston-based nonprofit investor group that advocates environmental sustainability, framed it as the &quot;Clean Trillion&quot; in an investment campaign that has become a rallying cry.</P><P>While $1 trillion sounds like a lot, knowing the figure is good news, according to <mark>climate</mark> activists, investment experts and United Nations organizers of the next round of global <mark>climate</mark> talks. Worldwide, almost $4 trillion a year will need to be invested over that time anyway in electric grids, power plants and energy efficiency, the IEA says. In a global economy of $75 trillion, $1 trillion works out to 1.3 percent of the world's annual output of goods and services, or about $140 a person. The calculation also focuses the discussion on investment—suggesting the potential for returns and profits—rather than on costs for disaster response and losses to rising oceans.</P><P>&quot;One of the things we're trying to show is that this is an opportunity story in response to the horror of the risks we're facing,&quot; says Sean Kidney, chief executive officer of the <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>bonds.net/""><mark>Climate</mark> Bonds Initiative</A>, a London-based nonprofit promoting large-scale investment in a low-<mark>carbon</mark> world. &quot;We're in a big hole. The key thing is for government and investors to sit down and work it out. It's got to be a grand collaboration to get out of the hole.&quot;</P><P>Putting a price tag on the energy sources, transportation systems, energy-saving steps and reductions in <mark>carbon</mark>-based greenhouse gas emissions provides a framework for discussion, according to the IEA, corporate leaders and others. It has also shifted the perspective of companies and investors. On Sept. 23, the UN is hosting a <mark>Climate</mark> Summit in New York that's meant to showcase new <mark>climate</mark>-related pledges from governments and to boost support for an international <mark>climate</mark> treaty. Next year in Paris, negotiators hope to sign a successor agreement to the expired Kyoto <mark>climate</mark> accord. </P><P><STRONG>Importance of 2 Degrees</STRONG></P><P>Nations participating in the treaty talks will attempt to work out a plan for keeping the average temperature of the world's atmosphere from climbing by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since the dawn of the Industrial Age in the 18th Century. The rapid increase in burning of fossil fuels over the past 2½ centuries has poured billions of tons of <mark>carbon</mark> into the atmosphere, causing surface air temperatures to warm by 0.8 degrees on average, according to <mark>climate</mark> scientists. </P><P>Stopping the increase short of a 2-degree rise would allow the planet to dodge the most damaging effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, scientists say. The Earth's atmosphere is now on track to warm 4 degrees by the end of the century, triggering a range of mostly irreversible changes, leading to famine, water shortages, disease and wholesale migration away from coasts and expanding deserts, according to the <A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/"">Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark></A>.</P><P>Nations involved in the <mark>climate</mark> treaty negotiations agreed to the goal of holding the increase under 2 degrees, but most countries probably will fall short of their goals for reduced emissions by 2020. Greenhouse gases have continued to rise, largely because of the continued expansion in burning of fossil fuels, which is responsible for 70 percent of <mark>climate</mark>-change emissions, according to the IEA. Warming is a function of the accumulation of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and other gases, so every new coal-fired power plant brings the 2-degree limit closer.</P><P>Prodded by investors and growing evidence of <mark>climate change</mark>, businesses including General Motors Co., <mark>Toyota Motor Corp.</mark>, Nike Inc., General Mills Inc., Apple Inc. and Google Inc. have taken stock of how <mark>climate change</mark> will affect them. A growing number are shifting to renewable energy, preparing for sharply higher fossil fuel costs and developing more energy-efficient products. Now business leaders are urging global leaders to act.</P><P>Leading up to the UN <mark>Climate</mark> Summit next week in New York, business groups and investors who manage trillions of dollars published reports and held meetings to call for action. Last week, investment groups publicized the creation of <A href=""http://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/"">We Mean Business</A>, an umbrella organization of investors urging world leaders to agree on a plan for fighting <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>&quot;There's a very compelling signal to governments that business is moving forward,&quot; said Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, the group leading the <mark>climate</mark> treaty talks. &quot;The future will happen by default or design. It is in everyone's interest for that future to be based on policy on the part of governments and on design on the part of business sector. That is the ultimate collaboration that we're looking for.&quot; </P><P>While reframing the issue as an investment opportunity has altered the approach to slowing <mark>climate change</mark>, reaching a global agreement won't be easy. For years, <mark>climate</mark> talks have focused largely on the economic and environmental consequences of not acting. The goal has been to get polluting countries to agree to limits on burning of fossil fuels. With coal and oil the lifeblood of economic growth, that's been a tough sell.</P><P>Moreover, even if investment rises by more than $1 trillion a year, there's no certainty it will be enough. The <mark>climate</mark>, economies, technology and governments are complex systems that are in constant flux. This year, the IEA had to rework its estimates to reflect a larger-than-expected drop in the costs of generating solar energy, a delay in <mark>carbon</mark>-capturing technology and a hit to nuclear power projections after the Fukushima disaster in Japan.</P><P><STRONG>What $1 Trillion Will Buy</STRONG> </P><P>To make its estimate for clean energy investment, the IEA examined the costs and development of more than 500 related technologies, plumbed its 40-year database of global energy production and consumption statistics and combined them with emissions data and <mark>climate</mark> science.</P><P>In its report this year, the IEA said the world would need to invest an additional $44 trillion by 2050 in clean energy and related technologies to comply with the 2-degree pledge. The &quot;clean trillion&quot; formulation was based on the IEA's 2012 estimate of $36 trillion, but for simplicity and to account to other estimates that are higher and lower, the rounded $1 trillion has stuck. </P><P>Just to accommodate today's trends and projections for growth in energy demand, the world would have to fund $140 trillion in new and upgraded electric grids, power plants and energy efficiency, according to the IEA. The estimated $44 trillion of additional investments in clean energy increase that total by 35 percent.</P><P>While definitions vary, the IEA's clean-energy investment list includes:</P><P>• Renewable electricity-generation technologies such as wind, solar, and hydropower; </P><P>• Power infrastructure technology to eliminate wasted electricity and accommodate a mix of power sources; </P><P>• Systems that capture and store harmful <mark>carbon</mark> emissions; </P><P>• Technologies to make buildings, devices and machines more efficient; </P><P>• Improved industrial processes to reduce fuel consumption; </P><P>• Transportation advances such as hybrid/electric or fuel-cell vehicles.</P><P>Overhauling transportation will take the most money, accounting for 49 percent of the total, the IEA estimates. Power generation is second at 21 percent, with housing, offices and industrial installations accounting for the rest. </P><P>David Elzinga, author of the IEA report, warned that the $44 trillion cost estimate includes assumptions on the use of several new technologies that are still being developed, such as <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage. These need to be funded, nurtured and redesigned over time, and if successful, they will have to be widely deployed to reduce costs. </P><P>&quot;The less progress we make in the early stages, the more expensive it's going to get over the long term because you can't necessarily rush the learning,&quot; Elzinga said. &quot;You have to put the time in. You have to install the gigawatts or the megawatts in order to bring those costs down.&quot;</P><P>The world can still meet the 2-degree goal, he said, but the slower the progress, the greater the chances that existing and new fossil fuel facilities will have to be shut down before the end of their useful lives.</P><P>&quot;We see that approximately 800 gigawatts of generation capacity is going to need to be retired before the end of its technical life, so that's another example of how these costs go up,&quot; Elzinga said. &quot;Technology gets deployed, and then if we really need to meet our <mark>climate</mark> goals, we actually have to shut this stuff down. That's a waste of money.&quot;</P><P>Now, corporations, governments and groups ranging from the World Bank to pension managers are becoming more focused on the economic benefits of tackling <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>The IEA estimates, for example, that between now and 2050, the world could have a net savings of $115 trillion that would otherwise be spent on fossil fuels. The health benefits of limiting <mark>pollution</mark> also translate into substantial savings.</P><P>In addition, there is some evidence that the link between higher energy use and greater prosperity isn't absolute. <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/science/earth/sun-and-wind-alter-german-landscape-leaving-utilities-behind.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;region=CColumn&amp;module=MostEmailed&amp;version=Full&amp;src=me&amp;WT.nav=MostEmailed&amp;_r=0"">Germany</A> and some other economies have shown that economic growth and lower power use can co-exist. </P><P><STRONG>Investment Lags</STRONG> </P><P>So far, however, clean energy investment is lagging. Worldwide investment in clean energy peaked in 2011 at $318 billion, less than a third of the $1 trillion target. In 2013, clean energy funding fell to $254 billion, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The Bloomberg LP unit bases its calculations on a smaller &quot;clean energy&quot; universe than the IEA, omitting such things as energy efficiency measures, but it has consistent data stretching back to 2004.</P><P>There have been other reversals, too. Oil giants BP Plc and Chevron Corp., at one time among the largest investors in clean energy projects, have either dismantled or sold off their renewable energy units. And in some places—Australia and Ohio among them—politicians have dropped policies aimed at curbing fossil fuel use.</P><P>What's more, fossil fuel projects are still being built using outdated, more-polluting technology. According to the IEA, 60 percent of global coal technology deployed worldwide in the last 10 years fell into that category. </P><P>In January, Ceres launched an investment campaign framing the IEA's low-<mark>carbon</mark> funding target as the &quot;Clean Trillion.&quot; In a report accompanying the launch, Ceres—whose name was also the name of the Roman goddess for agriculture and fertility—laid out concrete ways to fund the transition and made the case that the task of reworking the global energy system was both feasible and potentially profitable. </P><P>&quot;A trillion is actually not a big number anymore in global economies,&quot; said Mark Fulton, a co-author of the Ceres Clean Trillion report. &quot;It's a challenge, but it's easily doable.&quot; </P><P><STRONG>Global Bond Market</STRONG></P><P>The global bond market, expected to be a critical source of clean energy money, is about $100 trillion strong—significantly larger than the market for stocks. And there is plenty of money sitting on the sidelines and transferable out of fossil-fuel investments. Pension funds, insurance companies, corporations and others have large amounts of cash on their balance sheets, and they're looking for investments that would boost returns in an era of record-low interest rates. </P><P>&quot;There is no problem with money,&quot; said Kidney of the <mark>Climate</mark> Bond Initiative, which has been following the emergence of green and <mark>climate</mark>-action bonds. &quot;The world is awash in capital that's looking for a good home.&quot; </P><P>Borrowed money in the form of bonds is especially useful for the <mark>climate</mark> challenge because ramping up renewable energy and other infrastructure requires large infusions of funds up front, and the payback accumulates over time as either revenue or savings. </P><P>A market for green bonds is already beginning to take root, with companies, governments and others selling debt instruments to fund rail projects, solar power plants, energy efficiency projects and even consumer purchases of electric cars. </P><P>Since 2008, the World Bank has issued more than $6.4 billion in green bonds in 17 currencies. The International Finance Corp. has issued $3.6 billion in green bonds. Intergovernmental economic development organizations have joined the trend, and so have governments and major corporations.</P><P>GDF Suez, a French utility, sold $3.4 billion in bonds to fund renewable projects. It was the largest green bond issued to date—and it attracted triple the amount of investment needed.</P><P>Overall, $503 billion was invested in 1,900 outstanding <mark>climate</mark>-themed bonds at the end of July, according to the <mark>Climate</mark> Bond Initiative. More than 70 percent of it funded rail and other transportation projects. A large percentage of those bonds included some form of government backing, thanks largely to the inclusion of state-backed railway projects in China and elsewhere. More green investment opportunities are needed, though, according to asset managers and investment authorities.</P><P><STRONG>'Clean-Energy Investment Gap'</STRONG> </P><P>&quot;Quite simply, there's a huge clean-energy investment gap,&quot; said Jack Ehnes, chief executive officer of the <A href=""http://www.calstrs.com/"">California State Teachers' Retirement System</A>, the second-largest U.S. pension fund, with assets of $146 billion.</P><P>Ehnes and hundreds of other leading investors attended the UN's Investor Summit on <mark>Climate</mark> Risk last January on ways to increase <mark>climate</mark>-related financing.</P><P>&quot;Meeting the $1 trillion-a-year goal will be a challenge, but it is where we need to be in order to protect and grow or portfolios and to ensure the long-term sustainability of our planet,&quot; Ehnes said. </P><P>Ceres President Mindy Lubber said pension funds aren’t alone in seeking investing opportunities. </P><P>&quot;Many in the business community ... are eager for <mark>climate</mark> action,&quot; Lubber said. &quot;Businesses have seen firsthand the devastating impact of <mark>climate change</mark>, and they realize it is not good for the planet or for our economy.&quot;</P><P>Lubber and others said there are several roadblocks slowing down clean energy investment. The main one is uncertainty over the strength of government commitments to help move energy systems from fossil fuels to clean energy. If the UN doesn't broker a <mark>climate</mark> treaty, will federal and regional governments act aggressively? Will they enact policies to accelerate the transitions—and will they renege on those policies? </P><P>&quot;Many corporations are wising up and responding to both the risks and the opportunities that <mark>climate change</mark> present,&quot; said Nigel Topping, executive director of CDP, a nonprofit that focuses on company disclosures on <mark>climate change</mark>. &quot;What's missing is a strong policy response around the world to <mark>climate change</mark>, and a lack of such a policy is adding dangerous uncertainty to the marketplace.&quot; That kind of uncertainty, he said, &quot;holds business back from bold investment.&quot;</P><P>Investors are also waiting for a strong flow of green projects that offer good returns, but that aren’t too risky. Funding won't go to green bonds in large sums unless they are financially on a par with, or better than, other investment options, investor groups say. </P><P>Governments can assist on that front, too, by providing loan guarantees and shouldering some of the costs. Last month, for example, the <A href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-infrastructure-guarantee-for-speyside-renewable-energy-plan-issued-by-treasury"">U.K. government provided guarantees</A> for $78.7 million in bonds for a Scottish biomass power project. </P><P>Such guarantees are one way governments can reduce risk and help raise investor interest in <mark>climate</mark> or green bonds. Governments can also help along the energy transformation by changing regulations, instituting mandates, providing tax breaks and incentives, and funding critical research and development, advocates say. </P><P>Policy-makers also can raise the cost of using fossil fuels by removing subsidies, creating disincentives and instituting strict emission controls.</P><P>One of the most discussed policy options is putting a price on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. One way to do that is by imposing a steadily rising tax on fossil fuel use. Another is to enact a cap-and-trade system that would set progressively lower emission limits and allow trading of emission credits in a market. Power plants and others would have to buy credits at increasing prices to continue to operate. <mark>Carbon</mark> markets are widespread in Europe and elsewhere, including in California and the Northeast. </P><P>What it comes down to, according to the UN's Figueres, is that it’s going to take major commitments from government leaders and investors to help the world stay clear of the worst effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;This is absolutely critical, because we are running out of time,&quot; she said. &quot;We can no longer afford the luxury of being gradual or incremental. We really do need very, very stark changes right away.&quot;</P><P><EM>An earlier version of this story misstated that the $1 trillion per year clean energy investment was equivalent to $10,400 per person.</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Being a responsible corporate citizen is central to Toyota’s culture and is embedded in our <A href=""http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/conditions/philosophy/guiding_principles.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Guiding Principles</A>.</P><P>It is also important to become a company that can achieve “<mark>sustainable</mark> growth”, meaning growing our business while at the same time reducing any negative effects or externalities (e.g. GHG emissions)  from our operations and products. The spirit of this challenge propels our <mark>innovation</mark>, and is part of Toyota’s DNA. We wish to continue to be a company that creates a desirable future with our stakeholders and brings smiles to our customers and society.</P><H2>How is Toyota leading on sustainability?</H2><P>Toyota has a broad portfolio of diverse initiatives promoting sustainability including:</P><UL><LI>As of Jan. 31, 2017, we have reached more than 10 million cumulative units of hybrid vehicle (HV) sales globally, including plug-in hybrids. The latest milestone was achieved just nine months after total global hybrid sales reached 9 million units at the end of April 2016.</LI><LI>Including Prius Prime, Toyota and Lexus now have 14 hybrid models available in North America; globally, we have 33. We estimate Toyota’s hybrid technology has helped save more than 7.66 billion gallons of gasoline worldwide and resulted in an estimated 77 million fewer tons of <mark>CO2</mark> emissions, since 1997 when Prius first became available in Japan.</LI><LI>In late 2015, we introduced the Mirai fuel cell electric vehicle in Japan, followed by Europe and California in 2016. The Mirai provides over 300 miles of driving range, a refuelling time of around five minutes, and the only tailpipe emission is water.  Mirai availability will expand as hydrogen infrastructure grows.</LI><LI>We have made close to 6,000 hydrogen fuel cell patents available, royalty free, to support the expansion of a hydrogen society.</LI><LI>We are a leader in the number of dealerships that have achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) certification. With 54 and counting, Toyota and Lexus have more dealership facilities certified to LEED® standards in the U.S. and Canada than any other auto manufacturer.</LI></UL><H2>What is an example of an industry leading best practice in <mark>sustainable</mark> product or operations at Toyota?</H2><P>From a product perspective:</P><UL><LI>Our Prius Prime has an EPA-estimated 133 MPGe, making it the most fuel-efficient vehicle on the road today. The improved efficiency represents a substantial 26 percent enhancement over its predecessor.</LI><LI>Our Mirai fuel cell electric vehicle boasts one of the highest ranges of any zero emission vehicle on the road. Mirai is leading the world forward toward a more <mark>sustainable</mark> future.</LI><LI>Advanced battery research – breakthrough involving magnesium batteries
that could open the door for smaller, longer-lasting batteries for everything
from cell phones to cars. We published this research in the hopes of moving battery research along<STRONG>.</STRONG></LI></UL><P>From an operations perspective:</P><UL><LI>We achieved a 12th consecutive Energy Star Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award. Toyota was recognized with this award from the Environmental Protection Agency for its continued leadership in protecting the environment through energy efficiency. EPA recognizes Energy Star partners that demonstrate improved energy performance of buildings and plants through a corporate-wide energy program. Since 2002, Toyota has saved more than 16 billion kWh of electricity and realized cost savings of $640 million across its 14 North American manufacturing sites.</LI><LI>We are a founding member of the US Zero Waste Business Council and a thought-leader in developing new waste metrics. The U.S. ZWBC defines a Zero Waste Business as one with a 90 percent or greater diversion of all waste from landfill, incineration and the environment, with an ultimate goal of 100 percent diversion. Toyota is helping to define how to measure this, and, in the process, is helping to evolve waste management thinking from basic diversion of waste from landfill to reducing at the source and increasing reuse and recycling.</LI></UL><H2>Is Toyota transparent about its GHG emissions (including scope 3 or use of its products)?</H2><P>Yes. TMC reports global GHG emissions in its global environmental report and through CDP.  TMC provides <A href=""https://www.cdp.net/en#a8888e63070314c2285625253a462815"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">scope 3 data to CDP</A>, including for emissions from use of sold product.

environmental action plan, which will put us on track to achieving these ambitious goals.</P><H2>How would you sum up the importance of sustainability and its impact on long term value creation?</H2><P>Toyota will continue to improve in all aspects of sustainability in part to achieve a net positive impact as a business, as outlined by our 2050 Global Challenge.

The number two company was Suzuki and was far behind Tesla; Suzuki discontinued US auto sales in 2012 but was able to transfer credits accumulated in the past. Companies that acquired ZEV credits to meet their requirements included Chrysler, GM, Honda, Jaguar Land Rover, Subaru, and Volkswagen (though it’s not reported if they acquired their credits through Tesla or another automakers).

Check out this video interview Terry Duncan, chief of consumer engagement at <A href=""http://automotivedigest.com/video/scooters-coming-to-america/"">Mahindra GenZe</A>, a US startup that has backing from India’s Mahindra. GenZe is rolling out an electric scooter in early 2014 targeted toward Millennials in the US. The product and audience was chosen based on two premises – urbanization is happening in the world’s major cities and transportation is being heavily impacted; Millennials in their late teens to early 30s are the right market to start with, since they’re not buying cars as much as previous generations, are moving to cities, and want functional, practical transportation alternatives. In another video, you’ll hear him discuss the design decisions made on the bike; while these types of vehicles have huge sales numbers in countries like China, they need to be extremely pragmatic and, let’s say, cool, to make it in the US.</P><P><B>Top News of the Week:</B></P><OL start=""1""><LI>A group of Chinese investors based on Hong Kong and led by Richard Li are <B>investing in Fisker Automotive</B> for an unreported amount. This should finish the US Dept. of Energy’s loan to Fisker – most all of the $192 million loan needs to be paid back and the investor deal will probably only meet some of it, which the US government has been ready to accept. A small chunk of the payback will come through <B>former GM vice chairman Bob Lutz</B>. VL Automotive, a small Detroit company that has Lutz’ backing, will be converting 25 unsold Karmas from plug-in hybrid power to Corvette power. VL had to settle a dispute with an Asian investor that had prevented them from accessing codes operating the car’s infotainment system. Lutz says these converted Karmas will come out in 2014 for something close to $200,000.</LI><LI><B>Clean­Fuel USA has installed 85 retail propane auto­gas fuel­ing sta­tions across 13 states.</B> This was funded by a $12 mil­lion grant from the US Depart­ment of Energy’s Amer­i­can Recov­ery and Rein­vest­ment Act. Texas State Tech­ni­cal Col­lege – TSTC – served as the lead grantee. The major­ity of the 85 sta­tions are located near heav­ily traf­ficked road­ways, exist­ing fuel­ing sta­tions, major air­ports and home improve­ment stores, Clean­Fuel said.</LI><LI><B>Don’t believe in <mark>climate change</mark>?

The longitudinal and multi-dimensional analysis investigates the dynamics of the <mark>climate change</mark> problem in terms of socio-political mobilization by social movements, scientists, wider publics and policymakers.

The paper not only applies the DILC-model, but also proposes three elaborations: (a) the continued diversity of technical solutions, and ‘ups and downs’ in future expectations, creates uncertainty which delays strategic reorientation; (b) firms may develop radical <mark>innovation</mark>s for political and social purposes in early phases of the model; (c) issue lifecycles are also shaped by external influences from other problems and contexts.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><UL class=""issue-navigation"" id=""issue-navigation""><LI class=""previous""><BUTTON class=""button-alternative button-alternative-tertiary"" disabled="""" type=""button""><SPAN class=""button-alternative-text""><SPAN><STRONG>Previous </STRONG>article<SPAN class=""extra-detail""> in issue</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></BUTTON></LI></UL></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

From Tsutsumi's viewing gantries, two production lines stretch away into the distance. These halls house the trim workshop. Here, completed body shells roll in, are divested of their doors (which make their way in pairs along a separate line) and the interior, hybrid system, dashboard and seats are installed. The factory, which has been making Priuses since 2003, produces 430,000 cars a year. From 6.30am to 1am, it can turn out a Prius every minute.</P><P class=""bb-p"">This is the Toyota Production System (TPS) at work, a fabled refinement that funnels the immense complexity of car-making into a series of simple stages. Each step is serviced using the just-in-time manufacturing process by the requisite parts supplier. The system is controlled by the workers themselves, who have autonomy over stopping and starting the line to resolve issues.</P><P class=""bb-p"">TPS is a mainstay of business-school case studies, as well as being widely imitated by envious rivals. The system is about efficiency in all its forms, from the constant tracking of components (<EM class=""bb-em"">kanban</EM>) to the fault-reporting system (<EM class=""bb-em"">andon</EM>), which dates back to Toyota Industries founder Sakichi Toyoda's early days making looms. The process of constant improvement is known as <EM class=""bb-em"">kaizen</EM>. Toyota has this down to a fine art, employing <EM class=""bb-em"">kaizen</EM> teams to roam the factory and scout for potential problems and possible efficiencies. On posters, shirts and tabards, the plant's official mascot - a cartoon horse called Tsutsuma-Kun - preaches health and safety.</P><ASIDE class=""ad__main is-hidden ad--article ad--article-rail ad--article-rail-top stick-wrapper ""><DIV class=""ad__block stick-element""><H5 class=""ad__title"">Advertisement</H5></DIV></ASIDE><P class=""bb-p"">In the adjoining building, stamped-steel Prius bodies are assembled robotically, using conventional welding and lasers (as well as a secret proprietary method that WIRED wasn't allowed to photograph). Today, the 1,850 robots at Tsutsumi are sourced from one of three main suppliers: Nachi, Yaskawa and Kawasaki. As the body shells roll into position, a cluster of around ten closely spaced robotic arms swivel and pivot in a synchronised dance that is simultaneously beguiling, awe-inspiring and terrifying. Then they all lurch forward at once, finding the pinch points where two pieces join, then dab and squeeze their welding pincers along the seams to seal them. Each stage takes just under a minute, before the arms retract and the line rolls on. Large components are sent straight to the line by a system of overhead wires and gravity-driven palettes. At the same time, a constant stream of electric trains bring the rest along a miniature road system of intersections and stop signs. The building is a chorus of whirring ratchets, beeping trucks, buzzing drills, the rattle of conveyor belts and pulleys and the hum of the air-conditioning.</P><P class=""bb-p"">The sheer volume of Priuses being built here speaks of its achievement. For two decades, no car has done more to alter the public perception of the hybrid automobile and to pave the way for electric vehicles. Black Priuses, thanks to Uber, have become ubiquitous on the streets of capital cities. They are verbal shorthand for generic, efficient, classless transportation. The Prius's job is, in many ways, complete. Toyota is now working on another vehicle - one that has the potential to change our relationship with cars all over again.</P><ASIDE class=""a-sidebar-content""><H4 class=""a-sidebar-content__title"">Read next</H4><UL class=""global__list-reset a-sidebar-content__list""><LI class=""a-sidebar-content__list-item""><ARTICLE class=""c-card c-card--portrait-small""><DIV class=""c-card__obj""><DIV class=""c-card__obj__body""><DIV class=""c-card__header""><H3 class=""c-card__title""><SPAN>The high-stakes race to stop the trafficking of priceless artefacts</SPAN></H3></DIV><DIV class=""c-card__footer""><P class=""c-card__byline""><SPAN class=""c-card__byline-prefix"">By</SPAN><SPAN class=""c-card__byline-name"">Karen Emslie</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></LI></UL></ASIDE><FIGURE class=""bb-figure  bb-figure--landscape  bb-figure--custom bb-figure--internal""><DIV class=""bb-figure__content""><FIGCAPTION class=""bb-figure__caption""><P class=""bb-p"">Takeshi Uchiyamada, chairman of the <mark>Toyota Motor Corpo</mark>ration</P></FIGCAPTION><DIV class=""bb-figure__credit"">Christoffer Rudquist</DIV></DIV></FIGURE><P class=""bb-p""><SPAN class=""bb-dropcap bb-dropcap--letter"">S</SPAN><STRONG class=""bb-strong"">hoichi Kaneko is deputy chief engineer on the</STRONG> fourth-generation Prius, which launched in 2016.

In Japan, however, the Prius sold well, but became increasingly associated with an ageing customer base. <mark>Innovation</mark> was swiftly subsumed by tradition. Hybrids, it turns out, weren't sexy. Toyota has attempted to back out of this branding cul-de-sac by focusing on technology, with the introduction of a more advanced plug-in hybrid version (PHV) in 2012.</P><P class=""bb-p"">On paper, the present-day Prius falls short of its rivals. Tesla has wrestled away its credentials as the car of choice for the conspicuously eco-conscious. Its range falls short of true electric rivals from Nissan, General Motors and others. &quot;We collected data from the first-generation car - Japanese motorists tend to only drive 20km a day,&quot; Kaneko says, in reference to the Prius PHV's electric-only range of 60km. Most PHV drivers used their cars as if they were fully electric, making short hops between charge points and rarely filling the tank.</P><ASIDE class=""a-sidebar-content""><H4 class=""a-sidebar-content__title"">Read next</H4><UL class=""global__list-reset a-sidebar-content__list""><LI class=""a-sidebar-content__list-item""><ARTICLE class=""c-card c-card--portrait-small""><DIV class=""c-card__obj""><DIV class=""c-card__obj__body""><DIV class=""c-card__header""><H3 class=""c-card__title""><SPAN>The struggle to turn psychedelics into life-changing treatments</SPAN></H3></DIV><DIV class=""c-card__footer""><P class=""c-card__byline""><SPAN class=""c-card__byline-prefix"">By</SPAN><SPAN class=""c-card__byline-name"">Nicola Davison</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></LI></UL></ASIDE><P class=""bb-p"">For the company that shaped a generation's attitude to petrol-powered cars, Toyota is reluctant to change too much too soon. &quot;Toyota sees that gasoline fuel has many years to go.

The car's gestation is charted in Hideshi Itazaki's book <EM class=""bb-em"">The Prius that Shook the World</EM>, published in 1999. (The title is a nod to the 1990 bestseller <EM class=""bb-em"">The Machine That Changed the World</EM>, which introduced Toyota's lean-production concept.) Itazaki's book is written in the breathless style of the Japanese business novel, a hugely popular fiction genre that sidesteps Japan's traditionally deferential relationship between media and business by using corporate culture as a backdrop for action and romance. This telling of the Prius story does its best to bring drama to the banal. One passage reads: &quot;Shimatani-kun, I feel rather awkward, but would you help us out in the mass-production division? We need the diagonal-beam technology that you developed.&quot;</P><P class=""bb-p"">The Prius was the result of Toyota's G21 project, which was established in September 1993 to design a car for the next century.

Immaculately turned out in a white shirt and navy pinstripe suit with a red pocket, the grey-haired 71-year-old executive has been Toyota's chairman since 2013. A company lifer, he began his career in 1969 in computing and research, exploring ways of reducing vibration.

The final design was by Irwin Liu at Calty, Toyota's Californian studio. The Prius MK 1 is prosaic in the extreme, but that didn't really matter: it was a car for motorists who care more about what cars mean, rather than how they look.</P><P class=""bb-p"">Uchiyamada says he immediately knew the Prius would be a success. &quot;Sales started in December 1997, two months after we first showed the car.

Although electric vehicles are becoming mainstream, many in the industry consider hydrogen to be the true successor to fossil fuels. Hydrogen is expensive and difficult to store, but it is clean. The chemical reaction in a fuel cell produces only water. It is also quick to refuel, unlike batteries. Japan has announced its intention to become the world's first hydrogen society. Toyota hopes that its new car, the Mirai, could end up being to hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles what the Prius was to hybrids.</P><P class=""bb-p"">Mirai is a female Japanese name, meaning &quot;future&quot;. With a range of around 650km and a low centre of gravity, the Mirai drives and handles like a regular car. Its only emissions are water. Like the Prius, it's friendly looking; aesthetically safe, if not groundbreaking. (Anthropomorphism plays an important role in Japanese car culture, as Karasawa alluded - cars aren't as much signifiers of status, but objects of endearment.) Japan-only models have a plug in the boot that can supply up to 60kWh of electricity from the battery - or around a week's supply for the average family of four.</P><P class=""bb-p"">Mirai chief engineer Yoshikazu Tanaka says that the saloon car's design aims to make fuel-cell vehicles mainstream. &quot;To start the hydrogen society, we needed to sell an ordinary passenger car. So we developed the Mirai,&quot; he explains.</P><P class=""bb-p"">The Mirai is built at the LFA Works at Motomachi, near Nagoya. It is one of Toyota's most prestigious manufacturing centres, where workers are often sent by other factories to learn specific processes and become trainers and leaders. The Mirai line is similar to a supercar workshop, producing a maximum of 13 cars a day - 4,605 in total at the time of our visit (of which precisely 2,687 were built for export, mostly to California). Robots and heavy-lifting equipment are conspicuously absent, although the scanned and stacked supply system and jaunty-sounding <EM class=""bb-em"">andon</EM> boards are all present and correct. The main obstacle to speed, aside from the immature state of the hydrogen market itself, is the time and effort it takes to make the fuel-cell stack and hydrogen tanks. Tolerances are critical; hydrogen's volatility is greatly tempered by safe, pressurised storage and every set of twin tanks is tested with inert helium to ensure there are no leaks in the slim pipes feeding into the stack.</P><ASIDE class=""a-sidebar-content""><H4 class=""a-sidebar-content__title"">Read next</H4><UL class=""global__list-reset a-sidebar-content__list""><LI class=""a-sidebar-content__list-item""><ARTICLE class=""c-card c-card--portrait-small""><DIV class=""c-card__obj""><DIV class=""c-card__obj__body""><DIV class=""c-card__header""><H3 class=""c-card__title""><SPAN>The inside story of Jan Koum and how Facebook bought WhatsApp</SPAN></H3></DIV><DIV class=""c-card__footer""><P class=""c-card__byline""><SPAN class=""c-card__byline-prefix"">By</SPAN><SPAN class=""c-card__byline-name"">David Rowan</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></LI></UL></ASIDE><P class=""bb-p"">The thick-walled hydrogen tanks are spun from <mark>carbon</mark> fibre-reinforced thermoplastic (CFRP), an impact-resistant structure that is not only tested during assembly, but which has been designed to shut down its valves in the event of any impact or damage. Workers use Bluetooth torque wrenches that beam data into a central computer. This ensures that every bolt is tightened the requisite amount during installation, while piping is kept outside of the passenger cell and a thicket of sensors detects any leaks. &quot;It's improbable that the hydrogen would start a fire,&quot; plant manager Akifumi Karasawa says. He explains that US testers have to shoot tanks with firearms; the hydrogen evaporates through the bullet hole and rises to disperse in the atmosphere, rather than pooling at ground level the way petrol does.</P><FIGURE class=""bb-figure  bb-figure--landscape  bb-figure--custom bb-figure--internal""><DIV class=""bb-figure__content""><FIGCAPTION class=""bb-figure__caption""><P class=""bb-p"">Robot arms weld panels to create the Prius's body</P></FIGCAPTION><DIV class=""bb-figure__credit"">Christoffer Rudquist</DIV></DIV></FIGURE><P class=""bb-p""><SPAN class=""bb-dropcap bb-dropcap--letter"">T</SPAN><STRONG class=""bb-strong"">here's a crucial difference between the Prius and the Mirai:</STRONG> the absence of hydrogen infrastructure. Hydrogen production, transportation and bulk storage are still major challenges. The vast majority of hydrogen is generated using fossil fuels, which simply shifts C02 generation from tailpipe to production facility. And what the combination of fuel cell and electric motor make up in efficiency, they lose in density; you need more space for hydrogen storage compared to regular petrol or diesel, issues that increase dramatically when you consider tankers, pipelines and on-site storage. Hydrogen's proponents acknowledge the enormous costs involved in creating even a modest network; its critics dismiss it for all but the most specialist applications.</P><P class=""bb-p"">Building the Mirai illustrates the complexities involved. It takes about four days for the raw metal and components to be bolted together into a single car, which is about twice the length of time of a regular saloon. Making 2,000 Mirais a month requires intensive automation. The car is being &quot;productionised&quot; so that it can shift away from its meticulous workshops and on to the regular lines.</P><FIGURE class=""bb-figure  bb-figure--landscape  bb-figure--custom bb-figure--internal""><DIV class=""bb-figure__content""><FIGCAPTION class=""bb-figure__caption""><P class=""bb-p"">A Prius with Thermo-Tect paint, which boosts solar reflectivity</P></FIGCAPTION><DIV class=""bb-figure__credit"">Christoffer Rudquist</DIV></DIV></FIGURE><P class=""bb-p"">It's here that the TPS will be tested. The engineering challenges facing the Mirai are greater than those faced by Uchimayada's team when developing the Prius's hybrid engine.

The German Association of the Automotive Industry this week agreed to retrofit about 5 million cars with equipment that will emit 25 to 30 percent less nitrogen oxide.</P><P>Analysts said the accord reflects an aim to upgrade and preserve internal-combustion vehicles, rather than accelerate the transition to electric vehicle technology — and warned that could eventually hurt German automakers.</P><P>Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, an expert on the automotive industry at the University of Duisburg-Essen, said the deal reached at the automakers' summit was aimed largely at convincing cities not to adopt wholesale bans on diesel, which has powered European engines for decades. Pressure from German courts to get <mark>pollution</mark> under control has joined repeated warnings from the European Commission about unlawful levels of nitrogen oxide.</P><P>But without more far-reaching changes, Dudenhöffer warned Germany is endangering its position in a market it once dominated.</P><P>“The summit tells the public that we in Germany are at a dead end,” he said. “What we need is a U-turn to go in the exact opposite direction.”</P><P>Dudenhöffer said Tesla, the largest American manufacturer of electric vehicles, poses a formidable challenge. “To have invented the technology means you’re Apple. Everyone else catching up is Samsung,” he said.</P><P>Germany’s response cannot be to “clean up a 20th-century technology,” said Greg Archer, director of clean vehicles at the Brussels-based advocacy organization, Transport &amp; Environment. The aim instead, he said, should be to shift to “zero-emission vehicles.”</P><P>“France and the U.K. are paving the way on that, and Germany along with its carmakers seem to be lagging behind,” Archer said. “The danger for Germany is that it continues producing cars that the rest of the world no longer wants. Just 5 percent of the new cars sold outside Europe are diesels.”</P><P>However, national pledges for a move toward all electric vehicle fleets have also met with <A href=""http://www.liberation.fr/futurs/2017/07/12/en-2040-qu-aura-t-on-sous-le-capot_1583477"">criticism. </A></P><P>And Guenther Oettinger, the European Union budget commissioner, has suggested it would be “significantly premature” to set a uniform E.U. date to abandon gas and diesel cars, according to the <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/german-eu-official-against-date-to-drop-combustion-engine/2017/07/31/8b705cda-75c8-11e7-8c17-533c52b2f014_story.html?utm_term=.9cfe1fe510b6"">Associated Press</A>.</P><P>It's also unclear how countries will meet the increased demand for electricity to power the electric vehicles.</P><P><SPAN style=""font-family: Georgia; color: #333333;"">The European Environment Agency projects electric vehicles will account for 9.5 percent of electricity consumption in 2050, from 0.03 percent in 2014.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""color: #333333;"">“If in some other countries they don’t have access to renewable electricity, the additional electricity might come from fossil fuel and some emissions might increase,” Alfredo Sánchez Vicente, Project Manager for Transport at the </SPAN><SPAN style=""color: #333333;"">European Environment Agency</SPAN><SPAN style=""color: #333333;"">, said in an interview.</SPAN></P><P><EM>Isaac Stanley-Becker contributed additional reporting from Berlin.</EM></P><P><STRONG>Read more:</STRONG></P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The only sedans in its <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/fords-profit-rises-as-auto-maker-reports-progress-on-cost-cuts-1524688854"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">future lineup</A> will be the Mustang and a crossover version of the Focus.</P></DIV></DIV><P>Meanwhile, the Donald Trump administration looks likely to roll back the Corporate Average Fuel Economy targets set by its predecessor’s Environmental Protection Agency. The Barack Obama administration’s CAFE standards require each automaker’s fleet to average 54.5 miles a gallon by 2025. (Carmakers can lower their targets by earning — or buying from their competitors — credits for adopting EPA-approved technologies such as energy-conserving air conditioning or making electric cars.) Environmentalists, and states like California that love them, are up in arms.</P><P>But the administration has a point — if not the courage to do better. CAFE standards are an absurdly indirect way to regulate emissions. And Ford’s decision demonstrates why.</P><P>Consider another energy-sucking invention that Americans love even more than their cars: mobile phones. In an <A href=""https://www.tomsguide.com/us/smartphones-best-battery-life,review-2857.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">independent trial</A> conducted by consumer site Tom’s Guide, the Apple iPhone 8’s battery held its charge for 11 hours, 16 minutes, making it the longest-lasting in the Apple lineup. By contrast, the Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom topped the list at 16 hours, 46 minutes. The iPhone X, which Tom’s Guide has rated the “best phone overall,” scored a <A href=""https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-smartphones,review-2223.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">mere 10 hours, 49 minutes.</A></P><P>Different phones aimed at different consumers offer different features. Different companies pursue different strategies. They make different trade-offs between performance, battery life and cost. A company can offer a full line of phones or specialize. It can sell feature phones with batteries that last for days or souped-up smartphones with fancy screens that gobble power. None of this is controversial. There is no federal law mandating that every company’s lineup of phones average an 18-hour battery life by 2025. That would be ridiculous. Why should Apple change its iPhone designs or sell feature phones just to hit an arbitrary average?</P><P>But that’s exactly what happens with automobiles.</P><P><A href=""https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/corporate-average-fuel-economy"" itemprop=""StoryLink"" itemscope=""itemscope"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">CAFE regulations</A> implicitly assume that every carmaker offers a full assortment of vehicles. Higher average requirements distort corporate strategies and encourage companies that are good at making trucks to make compact cars as well, even if their customers don’t want them. This artificially induced competition, often at giveaway prices, hurts manufacturers that are good at making small cars. The credit system ameliorates this effect by allowing small-car specialists to sell their credits to competitors who produce larger vehicles, but only in a roundabout way.</P><P>In the real world, on real streets, emissions depend not on car dealers’ full offerings but on individual vehicles and the people who drive them. One drawback of CAFE standards is that they apply only to new cars, a tiny fraction of those on the road. So they take a long time to reduce actual emissions. The rest of us happily go on driving our out-of-date vehicles, using just as much gasoline as ever.</P><P>That gets to the second behavioral problem: Better gas mileage encourages people to drive more. CAFE targets are not, in fact, emissions standards. They were established as a response to the oil shocks of the 1970s, not to global warming. They were designed to conserve fuel. In a new, CAFE-approved gas-sipping car, you can go farther for the same amount of money.</P><P>The rules survive because the costs are hidden in corporate income statements rather than being made explicit at the gas pump. CAFE standards tell drivers that emissions are someone else’s problem. But that’s also why they fall short. They give the real decision makers — drivers — no reason to change their behavior.</P><P>It makes perfect sense for Ford to make trucks rather than cars, just as it does for <mark>Toyota Motor Corp.</mark> to make hybrids. Whether the target is cars or smartphones, however, it makes no sense to dictate a company’s product offering in order to pretend to fight <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><DIV class=""trashline"">(<SPAN itemprop=""description"">Several readers have pointed out that this article, published April 27, uses an outdated description of CAFE standards.

To make significant progress, California will likely need to ratchet up or overhaul its <A href=""https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/capandtrade.htm"" target=""_blank"">cap-and-trade program</A> and pass new legislation to further regulate industries that have for years opposed such oversight.</P><P>Those businesses and other critics of the state’s <mark>climate</mark>-change policies could gain a powerful ally if Trump’s administration does prove hostile toward the California benchmarks.</P><P>Experts said the next president and his deputies could eliminate <mark>climate</mark>-related categories of federal funding for universities and national laboratories in California, as well as discourage private-sector grants for development of emerging technologies such as grid-scale battery storage and low-<mark>carbon</mark> fuels.</P><P>They also could try to <A href=""http://legal-planet.org/2016/11/11/what-does-a-trump-presidency-portend-for-californias-environmental-policies/"" target=""_blank"">bind state lawmakers hands’ on key regulatory issues</A>, according to legal scholars.</P><P>Executives from a host of industries — ranging from farming interests to petroleum and natural gas companies — have repeatedly argued that on <mark>climate change</mark>, California violates the federal pre-emption doctrine that prohibits certain state policies from exceeding federal laws. They will likely lobby the Trump administration to back lawsuits claiming that California has overstepped its legal authority under what’s known as the supremacy clause.</P></DIV><DIV class=""trb_ar_page"" data-role=""pagination_page"" data-content-page=""2""><P>Trump might work with the GOP-led Congress to bolster the companies’ legal leverage, said Richard Frank, director of the California Environmental Law &amp; Policy Center at UC Davis’ law school.</P><P>“(They) could cast new federal laws declaring specifically that what California is trying to do is contrary to the national interest and is pre-empted,” Frank said. “That would be the most dramatic and, I would say, radical step.” </P><P>Mary Nichols, chair of the state’s air board, has expressed skepticism that the Trump administration would attempt such a legislative move. She has publicly vowed to move forward with the agency’s growing role in regulating <mark>climate</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> in California.</P><P>Also on the legislative front, analysts said Trump and his team could try to strip references to <mark>climate</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> out of the Clean Air Act, which would then complicate or even hobble efforts by California and other states to rely on that cornerstone law in fashioning their greenhouse-emissions rules.</P><P>And the incoming administration might gut the <A id=""ORGOV000048"" title=""U.S. Environmental Protection Agency"" href=""/topic/environmental-issues/u.s.-environmental-protection-agency-ORGOV000048-topic.html"">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</A> — the predominant federal enforcer of <mark>climate</mark>-change rules.</P><H3>Trump’s potential deputies</H3><P>Several moves by Trump in recent weeks seem to signal a desire to follow through on his campaign statements about <mark>climate change</mark>, which included a pledge to walk away from the international <mark>climate</mark> accord forged last year in Paris. That treaty, which 195 nations have joined, commits each government to lowering emissions and calls for wealthier countries to assist developing ones with money and technology.</P><P>Trump’s highest-profile decision so far about the environment has been his nomination of <A id=""PEPLT005339"" title=""Scott Pruitt"" href=""/topic/politics-government/scott-pruitt-PEPLT005339-topic.html"">Scott Pruitt</A> to head the EPA.</P><P>Pruitt, currently the Oklahoma attorney general, <A href=""http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/us/politics/energy-firms-in-secretive-alliance-with-attorneys-general.html?_r=0&amp;referer="" target=""_blank"">has led a cadre of state attorneys general</A> in coordinated lawsuits against federal policies on greenhouse emissions, including those set by the EPA. He has somewhat acknowledged the existence of <mark>climate change</mark> but questioned whether human activity is playing any role. He also has disputed the severity of <mark>climate change</mark>’s effects as predicted by most of the scientific community.</P><P>During an October episode of the “Exploring Energy” radio show in Oklahoma, Pruitt said: “Is it truly man-made or is this just simply another period of time where the Earth is cooling, increasing in heat? Is it just typical, natural type of occurrences as opposed what the (Obama) administration says? … What people don’t realize is that what the scientists have done is input data into a computer and produced modeling as far as the trajectory of what’s going to occur. It’s predictive in nature. It’s speculative in nature. It’s not objectively measured, as far as us knowing for sure what’s going to occur.”</P><P>Shortly after news broke of Pruitt’s nomination, governor Brown’s executive secretary, Nancy McFadden, made <A href=""https://twitter.com/NancyEMcFadden/status/806667480395497472"" target=""_blank"">this post on Twitter</A>: “Next commander-in-chief picks <mark>climate change</mark> denier-in-chief to lead @EPA. We’ll stand our ground. CA’s ready. #ActOn<mark>Climate</mark>”</P><P>Tom Scott, executive director in California for the <A href=""http://www.nfib.com/about-nfib/"" target=""_blank"">National Federation of Independent Business</A>, had a decidedly different response last week about the Trump administration’s potential impact on <mark>climate</mark>-change issues in the Golden State.</P><P>“Small businesses in this state are hurting. The election of Trump has created some optimism,” said Scott, whose organization represents 22,000 small business owners in California and 325,000 nationally.</P><P>Trump then nominated <A id=""PEGPF00213"" title=""Ryan Zinke"" href=""/topic/politics-government/ryan-zinke-PEGPF00213-topic.html"">Ryan Zinke</A>, a former Navy SEAL and currently a Republican congressman representing Montana's at-large district, to become secretary of the U.S. Interior Department, a position that directs oil and gas drilling on federal lands and waters.</P><P>While Zinke has for years insisted the federal government should retain control of the nation's public lands, he has disagreed with the Obama administration's <mark>climate</mark> agenda by backing industry efforts to resume or expand logging and coal mining in those areas. He also has repeatedly voted in favor of preserving the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which relies on royalties from fossil-fuel exploration on public lands.</P><P>As for his perspective on <mark>climate change</mark>, Zinke said this in 2014 to the Billings Gazette newspaper in Montana: &quot;It's not a hoax, but it's not proven science either.&quot;</P><P>Beyond the Pruitt and Zinke picks, Trump and his transition team recently stoked concerns by issuing a <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/us/politics/<mark>climate</mark>-change-energy-department-donald-trump-transition.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">controversial memo</A> to the U.S. Energy Department.

During George W. Bush’s presidency, the EPA <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/19/washington/20epa-web.html"" target=""_blank"">blocked the state’s initial bid</A> to regulate greenhouse emissions from automakers’ vehicle fleets.</P><P>Until then, California had for decades received waivers for regulating traditional emissions from cars and light-duty trucks beyond what’s allowed under federal rules — a unique privilege granted in the 1970 Clean Air Act that grandfathered in the state’s regulatory authority but required ongoing approval from the EPA.</P><P>After taking office, President Barack Obama and his team not only granted California’s waiver application but extended state’s vehicle emission standards to the whole country. Those regulations, which took effect in 2012, in part require automakers to reduce greenhouse emissions by raising the average fuel efficiency of their vehicle fleets to 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016.</P><P>Two days after Trump won the election last month, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-regulations-trump-exclusive-idUSKBN1352EI"" target=""_blank"">appealed to Trump</A> to revisit the rules. The trade group represents General Motors, Ford Motor Co., <mark>Toyota Motor Corp.</mark> and other car makers.</P><P>Also last month, the Obama administration <A href=""http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-gas-mileage-standards-20161130-story.html"" target=""_blank"">fast-tracked a review</A> of the vehicle-fuel-efficiency program in an effort to more firmly lock in its targeted standards for future years. For example, it wants to mandate that automakers offer vehicle fleets with an average of more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025.</P><P>Such rules are a central part of strategies by both the federal and California governments to slash <mark>climate</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>. Transportation accounts for 26 percent of all greenhouse emissions nationally — and 37 percent in California.</P><P>If the Trump administration rolls back the national auto-emissions standards, California’s own vehicle-emissions regulations could take on a heightened significance. As <A href=""https://iaspub.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=16888&amp;flag=1"">allowed by the Clean Air Act</A>, more than a dozen other states have adopted those rules as well. They include New York, Texas, Pennsylvania and Georgia.  </P><P>“I would say it’s all hands on deck. We have too much at stake,” said the recently retired California Senator <A id=""PEPLT005102"" title=""Fran Pavley"" href=""/topic/politics-government/fran-pavley-PEPLT005102-topic.html"">Fran Pavley</A>, who spearheaded the state’s most prominent legislation on <mark>climate change</mark> during her 35-year political career.</P><P>Pruitt, the EPA nominee, has long urged the federal government and courts to give states more autonomy. He started a so-called “federalist unit” within the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office to oppose what he saw as federal encroachment.</P><P>But Pruitt’s state-powers position could easily flip, said <A href=""http://www.marquette.edu/polisci/faculty_nolette.shtml"">Paul Nolette</A>, a political science professor at Marquette University in Wisconsin and author of the 2015 book “Federalism on Trial: State Attorneys General and National Policy Making in Contemporary America.”</P><P>“There has indeed been a lot of talk already about returning power to the states under a Trump-Pruitt EPA, but I don’t buy that that’s the way things will turn out,” he said.</P><P>“The EPA would be unlikely to allow California and other piggy-backing states to raise (vehicle emissions) standards and will defend against claims from Becerra and other blue-state (attorneys general) that the federal government is violating states’ rights,” he added.</P><H3>In-state pressures</H3><P>All of this political uncertainty comes as California policy makers try to weigh which <mark>climate</mark> strategies have worked and which they might consider abandoning.</P><P>Many of the state’s <mark>climate</mark>-change programs aren’t proven yet, in large part because the economic crisis of the past decade has created the side effect of dampening activities that generate a lot of greenhouse emissions — from car commutes to factory production.</P><P>“Connecting greenhouse gas-reductions to a specific policy is difficult. Since we don’t yet have a good handle on the effectiveness of the policies California has implemented thus far, it’s hard to plan for the future,” said Andrew Campbell, executive director of UC Berkeley’s Energy Institute at Haas.</P><P>“California’s done very well in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions, but that’s mostly because of some of the slowdown we had during the mortgage crisis,” he added.</P><P>Another major question mark for California is its cap-and-trade system, which is being challenged in state courts by the California Chamber of Commerce. Critics of the program contend that it amounts to a tax and as such would have needed approval by two-thirds of the Legislature.</P><P>California has been receiving support for the program under Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which encourages states to set up similar cap-and-trade systems for power plants. The plan, which Obama created through executive action, followed the congressional defeat of a proposed national program to sell <mark>carbon</mark> allowances.</P><P>Trump and his team could very well strive to minimize the Clean Power Plan or kill it outright, although such efforts would likely involve years of administrative and legal wrangling.</P><P>In the meantime, California seems determined to continue its efforts to persuade other states — especially its close trading partners — to join its cap-and-trade system. In 2013, the state’s regulators finalized an agreement with Québec, Canada to integrate the two governments’ cap-and-trade programs. The Canadian government has called on all other provinces to roll out such programs, with Ontario scheduled to adopt one next year that would also be linked to California’s.  </P><P>Washington state plans to implement its own cap-and-trade system in January. Oregon has been studying an emissions trading program, but has not reached a decision on whether to move forward with it.</P><ASIDE class=""trb_em trb_embed "" data-content-embedlocation=""Embed + (3)"" data-content-id=""91593066"" data-content-size=""large"" data-content-type=""video"" data-content-slug=""sd-me-v-must-see-headlines"" data-content-subtype=""premiumvideo"" data-role=""sc_item  mediamanager_container  imgsize_ratiosizecontainer lightbox_container  "" data-state="""" data-embed-id=""91593066""><DIV class=""trb_em_m""><DIV class=""trb_em_r"" data-role=""lightbox_metadata""><DIV class=""trb_em_r_ca""><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It is easy to visualize safely cruising down the highway while reading for pleasure or writing a work email—rather than watching the road. Vehicle automation promises to transform how people get to work, run errands, and generally travel through the nation’s streets and highway systems. Children could commute to school alone, without relying on a parent. One can also imagine a sight-impaired person traveling alone to a doctor’s appointment. In cities, someone could hail an autonomous vehicle with a ride-sharing app and ride with other passengers going a similar direction. The idea of driverless robot cars has captured the public’s imagination as automakers and technology companies promote the potential leisure, safety, and environmental benefits of AVs.</P><DIV class=""shortcode newsletter-short col-md-4"" style=""float:right!important; margin-left: 75px;""><H3>Get the Latest on Energy and the Environment</H3></DIV><P>Today, automakers are already adding features to new vehicle models that assist drivers, such as parking assistance, lane centering, and automatic braking. As these features become standard in cars, automakers have set their sights on creating autonomous vehicles that do not need drivers at all. Silicon Valley and ride- and car-sharing companies are investing in technology and betting on the transportation sector’s shift toward autonomous vehicles.</P><P>In the midst of these advances in vehicle technology, the international community is working to address one of the greatest challenges of our time: <mark>climate change</mark>. The United States has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 and to achieving greater emissions reductions in the future.<SUP class=""footnote""><A href=""#fn-292588-1"" id=""fnref-292588-1"" onclick=""return fdfootnote_show(292588)"">1</A></SUP> To meet that goal, the United States will need to cut emissions from the transportation sector, which accounted for 26 percent of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. Of these transportation sector emissions, 61 percent came from light-duty vehicles, such as passenger cars.<SUP class=""footnote""><A href=""#fn-292588-2"" id=""fnref-292588-2"" onclick=""return fdfootnote_show(292588)"">2</A></SUP></P><P>Autonomous vehicles—particularly those that are passenger cars—could significantly affect the country’s ability to cut greenhouse gas emissions and move toward a <mark>carbon</mark>-free economy. Existing studies suggest that three main factors will determine whether putting more AVs on the road increases or decreases tailpipe <mark>carbon</mark> emissions: effect on the total vehicle-miles traveled in the United States; impacts on congestion; and AVs’ fuel efficiency and fossil fuel consumption. As such, autonomous vehicles must be assessed not only for their safety but also for their effect on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions levels.</P><P>To that end, the Center for American Progress reviewed the existing literature on the environmental impacts of automation in the light-duty vehicle sector. We found that existing research does not draw clear and consistent conclusions about the impact of autonomous vehicles on the environment generally and <mark>climate</mark> specifically. In particular, the research reviewed shows that:</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Vehicle miles traveled, or VMT—the </STRONG><STRONG>aggregate number of miles driven by vehicles in a given year—could increase because automation lowers the opportunity cost of driving.</STRONG> This could encourage people to take more car trips or accept longer commutes, since drivers would be able to multitask in vehicles rather than focusing on the road. Additionally, autonomous vehicle technology could allow groups of people currently unable to drive—such as the elderly, young, and people with disabilities—to travel alone in autonomous vehicles, putting more people on the road.</LI><LI><STRONG>VMT could decrease if autonomous vehicle technology is paired with ride- and car-sharing services.</STRONG> A system of shared autonomous vehicles could discourage individual car ownership and use technology to plan efficient routes to transport people from point to point. At the same time, however, shared autonomous vehicles could increase overall VMT if they make frequent passengerless trips to pick up their next client. Specialized software programs could mitigate this effect by planning the most efficient routes.</LI><LI><STRONG>Automation could reduce congestion and make each mile traveled more efficient.</STRONG> Autonomous vehicles that communicate with each other and their surroundings may drive more smoothly, without needing to frequently brake and accelerate. Fully autonomous and connected vehicles could reduce the number of traffic accidents and, therefore, unnecessary idling on roads.</LI><LI><STRONG>Drivers may not realize the congestion benefits of automation for years, until a large share of vehicles on the road are equipped with autonomous technology.</STRONG> In the shorter term, VMT and congestion could worsen as autonomous vehicles join the fleet without displacing traditional vehicles.</LI></UL><P>Automakers and boosters of autonomous vehicle technology argue that autonomous vehicles have the potential to transform the U.S. transportation sector and make it more efficient.

The Center for American Progress offers the following recommendations for additional research on vehicle-miles traveled, travel patterns, and gasoline use in AVs.</P><H4>Impact of gradual adoption on emissions</H4><P>Studies of environmental benefits often assume that every car is fully automated and shared and do not take into account a transition period in which humans still drive some of the vehicles on the road. A transportation system that is fully automated and dominated by car- and ride-sharing services is unlikely to occur for decades. Until that time, the number of vehicles and drivers on the road may increase along with emissions at precisely the time that the United States needs to be bending the emissions curve downward. More research is needed to study the impacts of incremental introduction of AVs to the country’s roadways; how gradual adoption of this technology might affect <mark>carbon</mark> emissions levels from the transportation sector; and how this relates to the country’s need to significantly cut emissions in the short term.</P><H4>Systems-based research</H4><P>More research is needed to understand how AVs will fit within the whole transportation and infrastructure system. In particular, researchers should examine the relative benefits and costs of investment in AVs compared with similar investment in public transit—another option for reducing vehicles on the road and cutting emissions from the transportation sector. Automakers and tech companies are driving the transition to a transportation system reliant on autonomous vehicles, but it is unclear whether that is the most efficient choice from an emissions-reduction perspective. Policymakers need a better understanding of how AVs and public transportation can work together to cut <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> from light-duty vehicles and how policymakers should direct transportation investment in order to achieve the maximum environmental benefit.</P><H4>Travel patterns and driver behavior</H4><P>One major area of uncertainty is the total effect of AVs on VMT. The existing research shows conflicting conclusions about whether AV deployment will reduce or induce travel demand. The challenge lies in the number of assumptions that factor into whether AVs will be a net positive or detriment to the <mark>climate</mark>: whether AVs will add new classes of drivers to the road, remove cars from the road through car-sharing, encourage people to commute from farther distances, or make vehicle-based transportation more efficient. Researchers need to compile more information about how automation would affect the social cost of driving if the driver can do other things, such as work, while traveling and how that would change driver behavior and choices. Overall, researchers do not appear to have the analytical tools needed to model this complex array of assumptions and identify the range of potential outcomes.</P><P>Experts should invest in new modeling capabilities to predict how these factors would interact; this would give policymakers a window into how to avoid potential pitfalls during the transition to an automated transportation system.</P><H4>Electrification of AVs</H4><P>Electrifying the autonomous vehicle fleet would alleviate concerns about new emissions from the transportation sector, assuming that the electricity sector continues to de<mark>carbon</mark>ize. Policymakers and stakeholders would benefit from a deeper understanding of how the electrification of the transportation system—which must happen to achieve the nation’s <mark>climate</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> reduction goals—can proceed in tandem with the automation of vehicles.</P><P>Electrification and automation of the transportation sector could require significant investment in infrastructure to support the new technologies. Further research should uncover what this infrastructure buildout would entail and how policymakers can ensure that it proceeds systematically and efficiently. Technological questions remain as well. For example, additional research may be necessary to examine how combining automation with electrification could affect vehicle performance, including battery life and driving range of EVs.</P><P>Additional consumer research should shed light on how automation supports electrification and vice versa. Researchers, for example, could build on existing studies suggesting that consumers may be more accepting of electric vehicles if they are autonomous—and therefore able to fuel themselves. This could give policymakers new insight into how to design better incentives to expedite the electrification of the transportation sector.</P><H4>Data collection and sharing</H4><P>The National Association of City Transportation Officials, or NACTO, has recommended some areas of analysis needed to improve the quality, quantity, and sharing of traffic data. They suggest directing federal and state funds to research on city operations of shared autonomous electric vehicles, as city streets require algorithms to address the most complex problems inhibiting smooth driving. Research in this arena should focus on what city infrastructure is needed to facilitate driving with traits that would enhance car-sharing, as well as efficient driving to reduce emissions.<SUP class=""footnote""><A href=""#fn-292588-94"" id=""fnref-292588-94"" onclick=""return fdfootnote_show(292588)"">94</A></SUP></P><P>NACTO also recommends implementing a modeling exercise similar to a study performed in Lisbon, Portugal, by the International Transport Forum in 2015.

It will come in three sizes: a bus-sized vehicle, a shuttle and a small delivery vehicle sized to run on sidewalks.</P><P>Toyota said at the CES global technology conference in Las Vegas that it will work with companies including Amazon.com Inc., Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing Technology Co, Pizza Hut, Mazda Motor Corp and Uber Technologies Inc to build the vehicle and its hardware and software support and develop connected mobility products.</P><P>After intense research and development in self-driving technology, automakers are beginning to unveil clearly defined autonomous vehicle strategies and looking to apply the technology to uses like ride services, shuttle services and package deliveries.</P><P>Toyota took longer than rivals to warm to the idea of autonomous vehicles, but has committed $1 billion through 2020 to develop advanced automated driving and artificial intelligence technology. It plans to begin testing cars that can drive themselves on highways around 2020.</P><P>&quot;This announcement marks a major step forward in our evolution towards <mark>sustainable</mark> mobility, demonstrating our continued expansion beyond traditional cars and trucks to the creation of new values including services for customers,&quot; said Toyota President Akio Toyoda in a statement.</P><P>The vehicle features an open control interface enabling Toyota's partner companies to install their own automated driving system. Toyota's so-called &quot;guardian&quot; technology will then act as a safety net, the company said.</P><P>Carmakers, tech companies and other service providers have partnered on self-driving projects over past two years, due to the difficulty and high cost of developing such technology alone. </P></DIV><DIV class=""news-share-block sharebar sticker clearfix""><DIV id=""sticker"" data-sticky_column=""""><P>Share</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

Three forces of expansion lead the company to change and improve: impossible goals, local customization, and experimentation. Not surprisingly, these forces make the organization more diverse, complicate decision making, and threaten Toyota’s control systems. To prevent the winds of change from blowing down the organization, the company also harnesses three forces of integration: the founders’ values, “up-and-in” people management, and open communication. These forces stabilize the company, help employees make sense of the environment in which they operate, and perpetuate Toyota’s values and culture.</P><P>Emulating Toyota isn’t about copying any one practice; it’s about creating a culture. And because the company’s culture of contradictions is centered on humans, who are imperfect, there will always be room for improvement.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article article-first-row premium""><P>No executive needs convincing that <mark>Toyota Motor Corpo</mark>ration has become one of the world’s greatest companies because of the Toyota Production System (TPS). The unorthodox manufacturing system enables the Japanese giant to make the planet’s best automobiles at the lowest cost and to develop new products quickly. Not only have Toyota’s rivals such as Chrysler, Daimler, Ford, Honda, and General Motors developed TPS-like systems, organizations such as hospitals and postal services also have adopted its underlying rules, tools, and conventions to become more efficient. An industry of lean-manufacturing experts have extolled the virtues of TPS so often and with so much conviction that managers believe its role in Toyota’s success to be one of the few enduring truths in an otherwise murky world.</P><P>Like many beliefs about Toyota, however, this doesn’t serve executives well. It’s a half-truth, and half-truths are dangerous. We studied Toyota for six years, during which time we visited facilities in 11 countries, attended numerous company meetings and events, and analyzed internal documents. We also conducted 220 interviews with former and existing Toyota employees, ranging from shop-floor workers to Toyota’s president, Katsuaki Watanabe. Our research shows that TPS is necessary but is by no means sufficient to account for Toyota’s success.</P><P>Quite simply, TPS is a “hard” <mark>innovation</mark> that allows the company to keep improving the way it manufactures vehicles; in addition, Toyota has mastered a “soft” <mark>innovation</mark> that relates to corporate culture. The company succeeds, we believe, because it creates contradictions and paradoxes in many aspects of organizational life. Employees have to operate in a culture where they constantly grapple with challenges and problems and must come up with fresh ideas. That’s why Toyota constantly gets better. The hard and the soft <mark>innovation</mark>s work in tandem. Like two wheels on a shaft that bear equal weight, together they move the company forward. Toyota’s culture of contradictions plays as important a role in its success as TPS does, but rivals and experts have so far overlooked it.</P><P>Toyota believes that efficiency alone cannot guarantee success. Make no mistake: No company practices Taylorism better than Toyota does. What’s different is that the company views employees not just as pairs of hands but as knowledge workers who accumulate <EM>chie</EM>—the wisdom of experience—on the company’s front lines. Toyota therefore invests heavily in people and organizational capabilities, and it garners ideas from everyone and everywhere: the shop floor, the office, the field. </P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P>Toyota views employees not just as pairs of hands but as knowledge workers who accumulate <EM>chie</EM>—the wisdom of experience—on the company’s front lines.</P></DIV></DIV><P>At the same time, studies of human cognition show that when people grapple with opposing insights, they understand the different aspects of an issue and come up with effective solutions. So Toyota deliberately fosters contradictory viewpoints within the organization and challenges employees to find solutions by transcending differences rather than resorting to compromises. This culture of tensions generates innovative ideas that Toyota implements to pull ahead of competitors, both incrementally and radically.</P><P>In the following pages, we will describe some key contradictions that Toyota fosters. We will also show how the company unleashes six forces, three of which drive it to experiment and expand while three help it to preserve its values and identity. Finally, we will briefly describe how other companies can learn to thrive on contradictions.</P><H2>A Culture of Contradictions</H2><P>Most outsiders find Toyota unfathomable because it doesn’t bear any of the telltale signs of a successful enterprise. In fact, it resembles a failing or stagnant giant in several ways. Toyota pays relatively low dividends and hoards cash, which smacks of inefficiency. From 1995 to 2006, Toyota’s dividends averaged only 20% of earnings. For instance, its 2006 payout of 21.3% was on par with that of smaller rivals, such as Nissan’s 22.9% and Hyundai-Kia’s 17.4%, but far behind (the then) DaimlerChrysler’s 47.5%. At the same time, it had accumulated $20 billion of cash, leading some analysts to call it Toyota Bank.</P><P>Most of Toyota’s senior executives are Japanese men, whereas top management in successful Western corporations is more diverse. The company’s roots are in a rural suburb of Nagoya called Mikawa, and they run deep, accounting for its managers’ humility and strong work ethic. Toyota doesn’t plan to relocate its headquarters to Tokyo as rivals like Honda have done. By any standard, the company pays executives very little. In 2005, Toyota’s top executives earned only one-tenth as much as Ford’s. Their compensation was lower than that of their counterparts at the 10 largest automobile companies, save Honda. Toyota managers also rise through the hierarchy slowly: In 2006, the company’s executive vice presidents were on average 61 years old—close to the retirement age at many non-Japanese companies. 
 </P><P>Another oddity at Toyota is the influence the founding Toyoda family wields even though it controls just 2% of the company’s stock. The Toyodas appear to have a say in most key decisions, but it isn’t clear why they exert power. The company’s presidents came mostly from the family’s ranks for decades, and although three nonfamily executives have been president over the past 13 years, there’s speculation that the next president will once again be a Toyoda.</P><P>Toyota doesn’t merely have some odd characteristics—it is steeped in contradictions and paradoxes. During the first phase of our research, we uncovered six major contradictory tendencies, one of which influences company strategy and the others Toyota’s organizational culture.</P><H3>Toyota moves slowly, yet it takes big leaps.</H3><P>For example, the company started production in the United States gradually. It began in 1984 by forming a joint venture with GM called New United Motor Manufacturing, in Fremont, California, and opened its first plant in Kentucky four years later. However, the launch of the Prius in Japan in 1997 was a huge leap. Toyota came up with a hybrid engine that combined the power of an internal combustion engine with the environmental friendliness of an electric motor much earlier than rivals.</P><H3>Toyota grows steadily, yet it is a paranoid company.</H3><P>In the early 1950s, the company faced near bankruptcy, but over the past 40 years, the company has recorded steady sales and market-share growth. Despite this enviable stability, senior executives constantly hammer home messages such as “Never be satisfied” and “There’s got to be a better way.” A favorite saying of former chairperson Hiroshi Okuda is “Reform business when business is good,” and Watanabe is fond of pointing out that “No change is bad.”</P><H3>Toyota’s operations are efficient, but it uses employees’ time in seemingly wasteful ways.</H3><P>You would be amazed to see how many people attend a meeting at Toyota even though most of them don’t participate in the discussions. The company assigns many more employees to offices in the field than rivals do, and its senior executives spend an inordinate amount of time visiting dealers. Toyota also uses a large number of multilingual coordinators—a post that Carlos Ghosn abolished at Nissan soon after he became CEO in 2001—to help break down barriers between its headquarters and international operations.</P><H3>Toyota is frugal, but it splurges on key areas.</H3><P>Only Wal-Mart can match Toyota’s reputation for penny pinching. In Japan, the company turns off the lights in its offices at lunchtime. Staff members often work together in one large room, with no partitions between desks, due to the high cost of office space in Japan. At the same time, Toyota spends huge sums of money on manufacturing facilities, dealer networks, and human resource development. For instance, since 1990, it has invested $22 billion in production centers and support facilities in the United States and Europe, and for the past six years, it has spent $170 million annually competing in the Formula One circuit.</P><H3>Toyota insists internal communications be simple, yet it builds complex social networks.</H3><P>It’s an unwritten Toyota rule that employees must keep language simple when communicating with each other. When making presentations, they summarize background information, objectives, analysis, action plans, and expected results on a single sheet of paper. At the same time, Toyota fosters a complex web of social networks because it wants “everybody to know everything.” The company develops horizontal links between employees across functional and geographic boundaries, grouping them by specializations and year of entry; creates vertical relationships across hierarchies through teaching relationships and mentoring; and fosters informal ties by inviting employees to join clubs based on birthplaces, sports interests, hobbies, and so on.</P><H3>Toyota has a strict hierarchy, but it gives employees freedom to push back.</H3><P>Voicing contrarian opinions, exposing problems, not blindly following bosses’ orders—these are all permissible employee behaviors. Watanabe, who recounts how he fought with his bosses as he rose through the ranks, often says, “Pick a friendly fight.” We were surprised to hear criticism about the company and senior management in our interviews, but employees didn’t seem worried. They felt they were doing the right thing by offering executives constructive criticism. 
 </P><P>Once we realized that contradictions are central to Toyota’s success, we tried to identify the underlying forces that cause them. However, digging into Toyota is like peeling an onion: You uncover layer after layer, but you never seem to reach the center. After we had written a half-dozen case studies, a pattern finally emerged. We identified six forces that cause contradictions inside the company. Three forces of expansion lead Toyota to instigate change and improvement. Not surprisingly, they make the organization more diverse, complicate decision making, and threaten its control and communications systems. To prevent the winds of change from blowing down the organization, Toyota also harnesses three forces of integration. They stabilize the company, help employees make sense of the environment in which they operate, and perpetuate Toyota’s values and culture.</P><H2>Forces of Expansion</H2><P>“This is how we do things here” is a common refrain in every organization. Established practices become standardized and create efficiencies. Over time, however, those methods can prevent the adoption of new ideas. Toyota prevents rigidity from creeping in by forcing employees to think about how to reach new customers, new segments, and new geographic areas and how to tackle the challenges of competitors, new ideas, and new practices. </P><ARTICLE-SIDEBAR class=""article-sidebar sidebar--half"" data-sidebar-alternate=""sidebar""><H4 class=""sidebar-title"">Three Forces of Expansion</H4><DIV class=""sidebar-contents height--collapse""><P>Three forces of expansion lead the company to instigate change and improvement </P><UL><LI>Impossible goals</LI></UL><UL><LI>Experimentation</LI></UL></DIV></ARTICLE-SIDEBAR><H3>Impossible goals.</H3><P>By setting near-unattainable goals, Toyota’s senior executives push the company to break free from established routines. This practice goes back to Toyota’s genesis. In 1937, the founder, Kiichiro Toyoda, wanted to produce automobiles in Japan without using foreign technology. It seemed like an impossible goal; even mighty <EM>zaibatsu</EM> such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui had decided against entering the automobile industry at that stage because of the investments they would have to make. Toyoda dared to—and the rest is history.</P><P>Toyota often sets tough goals to raise employees’ consciousness and self-worth. Consider the company’s global strategy: Meet every customer need and provide a full line in every market. It’s impossible for any company to do that. Besides, the strategy runs contrary to management thinking, which espouses the merits of making trade-offs. Strategy guru Michael E. Porter, for instance, says that the essence of strategy is choosing what not to do. However, Toyota tries to cater to every segment because of its belief that a car contributes to making people happy. It’s reminiscent of Henry Ford’s desire to make automobiles affordable to American families of moderate means so that they might enjoy “the blessings of happy hours spent in God’s great open spaces.” Toyota has set itself the goal of delivering “a full line in every market” to make employees feel they serve a useful purpose. <EM>Toyota Value</EM>, the document that outlines the company’s beliefs, says it best: “We are always optimizing to enhance the happiness of every customer as well as to build a better future for people, society, and the planet we share. This is our duty. This is Toyota.”</P><P>Many of Toyota’s goals are purposely vague, allowing employees to channel their energies in different directions and forcing specialists from different functions to collaborate across the rigid silos in which they usually work. For example, Watanabe has said that his goal is to build a car that makes the air cleaner, prevents accidents, makes people healthier and happier when they drive it, and gets you from coast to coast on one tank of gas (see “Lessons from Toyota’s Long Drive,” HBR July–August 2007). Zenji Yasuda, a former Toyota senior managing director, points out the wisdom of painting with broad strokes. “If he makes [the goal] more concrete, employees won’t be able to exercise their full potential. The vague nature of this goal confers freedom to researchers to open new avenues of exploration; procurement to look for new and unknown suppliers who possess needed technology; and sales to consider the next steps needed to sell such products.”</P><H3>Local customization.</H3><P>Toyota doesn’t modify its automobiles to local needs; it customizes both products and operations to the level of consumer sophistication in each country. This strategy pushes Toyota out of Japan, where it is dominant, and into overseas markets, where it has often been the underdog. Following the strategy increases operational complexity, but it maximizes employees’ creativity since they have to develop new technologies, new ways of marketing, and new supply chains. Nissan and Honda follow the same strategy, but less rigorously: In 2006, Toyota offered 94 models in Japan—almost three times as many as Nissan’s 35 and Honda’s 30 models. Pursuing local customization also exposes Toyota to the sophistication of local tastes. For instance, when it introduced the subcompact Yaris in 1999, Toyota had to offer advanced technology, greater safety, roomier interiors, and better fuel efficiency to live up to European customers’ expectations.</P><P>Local customization forces Toyota to push the envelope in numerous ways. For instance, the company faced complex challenges in 1998 when it developed the Innovative International Multipurpose Vehicle (IMV) platform. Toyota engineers had to design the platform to meet the needs of consumers in more than 140 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, Oceania, Central and South America, and the Middle East. The IMV platform is used for three vehicle types—trucks, minivans, and sport utility vehicles—so Toyota can minimize design and production costs. Notably, the IMV-based vehicles were the first that Toyota produced overseas without first making them in Japan, which led to the decentralized development of production know-how, manufacturing technology, and production planning technologies. Since 2004, Toyota has produced IMV-based models in Thailand, Indonesia, Argentina, and South Africa while India, the Philippines, and Malaysia manufacture them for their own markets.</P><P>The IMV also rendered the Made-in-Japan concept irrelevant to the Toyota brand. Many executives thought it was risky to relinquish the label since it had become synonymous with quality. However, executive vice president Akio Toyoda, then in charge of sales and production in Asia, launched a personal crusade to persuade employees that the company should replace Made in Japan with Made by Toyota. 
 </P><H3>Experimentation.</H3><P>Toyota’s eagerness to experiment helps it clear the hurdles that stand in the way of achieving near-impossible goals. People test hypotheses and learn from the consequent successes and failures. By encouraging employees to experiment, Toyota moves out of its comfort zone and into uncharted territory.</P><P>Toyota has found that a practical way to achieve the impossible is to think deeply but take small steps—and never give up. It first breaks down a big goal into manageable challenges. Then it experiments to come up with new initiatives and processes for handling the more difficult components of each challenge. This pragmatic approach to <mark>innovation</mark> yields numerous learning opportunities. Consider, for instance, Toyota’s path for developing the Prius. In 1993, the company decided to develop a car that would be environmentally friendly and easy to use. The development team, called G21, first came up with a car that delivered a 50% improvement in fuel efficiency. Toyota’s senior executives rejected the prototype and demanded a 100% improvement. That was unachievable using even the most advanced gasoline and diesel engines or even fuel cell technology–based engines. The G21 team had no choice but to tap a hybrid technology that one of the company’s laboratories was developing. Sure enough, the first engine wouldn’t start. When a subsequent model did, the prototype moved only a few hundred yards down the test track before coming to a dead halt. In later models, the battery pack shut down whenever it became too hot or cold. Despite these setbacks, Toyota didn’t stop working on the project and unveiled a hybrid concept car at the 1995 Tokyo Motor Show. Its executives knew that alternative power train technologies were emerging, but the fact that the Prius would be an interim solution didn’t deter them. They believed the project was worth the investment because Toyota would learn a lot in the process.</P><P>Toyota organizes experiments using strict routines, as is widely known. It has refined Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA), the continuous-improvement process used throughout the business world, into the Toyota Business Practices (TBP) process. The eight-step TBP lays out a path for employees to challenge the status quo: clarify the problem; break down the problem; set a target; analyze the root cause; develop countermeasures; see countermeasures through; monitor both results and processes; and standardize successful processes. Similarly, the A3 report, named for a sheet of paper 11 inches by 17 inches, is a succinct communication tool. As we mentioned earlier, it forces employees to capture the most essential information needed to solve a problem on a single sheet that they can disseminate widely. </P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P>By encouraging open communication as a core value, Toyota has made its culture remarkably tolerant of failure.</P></DIV></DIV><P>What sets Toyota’s culture apart is the way it encourages employees to be forthcoming about the mistakes they make or the problems they face. By encouraging open communication as a core value for decades, Toyota has made its culture remarkably tolerant of failure.</P><H2>Forces of Integration</H2><P>As Toyota expands, it has to deal with a greater variety of perspectives from the growing number of employees and customers in many markets. In addition, the quality of internal communications deteriorates, and it becomes difficult to coordinate operations across markets and product groups. How does the company cope with the hazards of constant change and growth? We found three forces of integration that allow Toyota to stick to its mission. They perpetuate its culture and stabilize the company’s expansion and transformation. </P><ARTICLE-SIDEBAR class=""article-sidebar sidebar--half"" data-sidebar-alternate=""sidebar""><H4 class=""sidebar-title"">Three Forces of Integration</H4><DIV class=""sidebar-contents height--collapse""><P>Three forces of integration stabilize the company’s expansion and transformation </P><UL><LI>Values from the founders</LI></UL><UL><LI>Open communication</LI></UL></DIV></ARTICLE-SIDEBAR><H3>Values from the founders.</H3><P>Over the decades, several people have developed Toyota’s values: Sakichi Toyoda, who created the parent Toyoda Automatic Loom Works; Kiichiro Toyoda, Sakichi’s son and founder of the <mark>Toyota Motor Corpo</mark>ration; Taiichi Ohno, the TPS’s creator; Eiji Toyoda, Kiichiro’s first cousin and a former Toyota president; Shotaro Kamiya, who developed the company’s sales network; and Shoichiro Toyoda, Kiichiro’s son and another former president. The values include the mind-set of continuous improvement (<EM>kaizen</EM>); respect for people and their capabilities; teamwork; humility; putting the customer first; and the importance of seeing things firsthand (<EM>genchi genbutsu</EM>).</P><P>Toyota inculcates these values in employees by demonstrating their everyday relevance through on-the-job training and through stories that managers tell succeeding generations of employees. Although it is a complex organization, we believe four simple beliefs have kept the company from losing its way.</P><H4>Tomorrow will be better than today.</H4><P>Toyota has succeeded in the long term because of its naive optimism. Its employees see obstacles as challenges that energize them to do better. They really believe that Toyota will make tomorrow a better day than today was. An attitude of never being satisfied with the status quo explains why employees conduct experiments all the time. 
 </P><H4>Everybody should win.</H4><P>The company has stressed teamwork as a guiding principle since its early days. When a problem arises, each member of the team is accountable and has the authority and responsibility to find a solution. The practice started on the factory floor and has spread throughout the corporation.</P><H4>Genchi genbutsu.</H4><P>At a recent conference, Toyota’s chairperson Fujio Cho translated <EM>genchi genbutsu</EM> as “Have you seen it yourself?” The implication is that if you have not seen something firsthand, your knowledge about it is suspect. Toyota’s senior executives hold themselves to the same standard, emphasizing the importance of the tacit knowledge rooted in each employee’s actions and experiences. By visiting a factory and a dealership when he was in St. Petersburg, Cho commanded respect not just by talking about <EM>genchi genbutsu</EM> but by practicing it.</P><H4>Customers first, dealers second—and manufacturer last.</H4><P>Toyota believes its success depends on maintaining the trust of dealers and customers, and it goes to extraordinary lengths to forge lasting relationships with them. Even on the factory floor, supervisors drive home to workers that it isn’t the company but customers that pay their salaries.</P><H3>Up-and-in people management.</H3><P>Many companies either promote employees or ask them to leave—up-or-out, as the practice is called. Toyota rarely weeds out underperformers, focusing instead on upgrading their capabilities. In fact, Toyota is still committed to long-term employment—as all Japanese companies once were. During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, for instance, Toyota’s Thailand operation weathered four straight years of losses with no job cuts. The order had come down from then president Hiroshi Okuda: “Cut all costs, but don’t touch any people.” In August 1998, Moody’s lowered Toyota’s credit rating from AAA to AA1, citing the guarantee of lifetime employment. Even though the downgrade increased Toyota’s interest payments by $220 million a year, company executives told the rating agency that it would not abandon its commitment.</P><P>Toyota prefers on-the-job training to off-the-job programs. During their initial training, employees are given the freedom to make judgment calls. They have to adhere to a broad set of guidelines rather than follow a strict set of rules. The company adds more context to employees’ perspectives by asking them to think as if they were two levels higher in the organization. Toyota trains employees in problem-solving methods during their first 10 years with the company. Another feature of its people management policies is the role exemplary employees play as mentors. They shoulder the responsibility of developing a cadre of managers who learn through experimentation, and pass on Toyota’s values by sharing personal experiences—a modern-day apprenticeship system.</P><P>When Toyota evaluates managers, it usually emphasizes process performance and learning over results. The company looks at how managers achieved their goals; how they handled issues; how they fostered organizational skills; and how they developed, motivated, and empowered people. The company uses five kinds of criteria, all of which are fuzzy and subjective. For instance, one category it employs is personal magnetism (<EM>jinbo</EM>), which captures how much trust and respect the manager has earned from others. <EM>Jinbo</EM> is a vague criterion that is open to interpretation and impossible to quantify; you can evaluate people on it only if you have worked closely with them. Another quintessentially Toyota measure of manager performance is persistence or resilience. The company sees this as part of its DNA, describing it as <EM>nebari tsuyosa</EM>, which translates, literally, as adhesive strength. </P><ARTICLE-SIDEBAR class=""article-sidebar sidebar--half"" data-sidebar-alternate=""sidebar""><H4 class=""sidebar-title"">Characteristics of Toyota Executives</H4><DIV class=""sidebar-contents height--collapse""><UL><LI>Willingness to listen and learn from others</LI></UL><UL><LI>Enthusiasm for constantly making improvements</LI></UL><UL><LI>Comfort with working in teams</LI></UL><UL><LI>Ability to take action quickly to solve a problem</LI></UL><UL><LI>Interest in coaching other employees</LI></UL><UL><LI>Modesty</LI></UL></DIV></ARTICLE-SIDEBAR><P>Toyota’s evaluation criteria are particularly relevant in automobile manufacturing, where various types of expertise are essential to success. It’s not the kind of company where a few shine. Watanabe says that “every single person is the main actor on the stage.” When Toyota promotes employees, it doesn’t praise them. Instead, senior executives deliver a message along these lines: “Congratulations on your promotion. Many others were within a hair’s breadth of being selected. Keep that in mind as you do your job.” This is to instill humility in employees by reminding them that their success is due in part to the efforts of equally accomplished colleagues.</P><H3>Open communication.</H3><P>Toyota operates 50 manufacturing facilities outside Japan, sells vehicles in more than 170 countries, and employs close to 300,000 people. Despite its size and reach, Toyota still functions like a small-town company. Its top executives operate on the assumption that “everybody knows everybody else’s business.” 
 </P><P>Information flows freely up and down the hierarchy and across functional and seniority levels, extending outside the organization to suppliers, customers, and dealers. Typical of traditional Eastern business practice, personal relationships are of primary importance, and Toyota’s networks are human rather than virtual. Employees must cultivate the skill of listening intently to opinions in an open environment. The result is a web of relationships that former executive vice president Yoshimi Inaba calls the “nerve system.” Like the human body’s central nervous system, Toyota transmits information swiftly across the entire organization.</P><P>Even in a Toyota plant, executives deliver and receive information by going to the front lines in person. For instance, the head of the Takaoka and Tsutsumi plants, Takahiro Fujioka, is on the factory floor every day and joins workers for drinks in the evening (<EM>nomikai</EM>) sometimes as often as four times a week. Similarly, senior sales people share information with dealers and learn about customer tastes by visiting them. Toyota uses this system to avoid the pitfalls of poor communication typical of big organizations. We identified five elements that underpin Toyota’s unique communications system.</P><H4>Disseminate know-how laterally.</H4><P>The slogan “Let’s <EM>yokoten</EM>” is often heard in the corridors of Toyota. <EM>Yokoten</EM>, which is short for <EM>yokoni tenkaisuru</EM>, literally means unfold or open out sideways. At Toyota, communication is viral and knowledge is diffused in all directions. The company has found that one of the best ways to ensure good communications is to have everyone work together in a large room with no partitions (<EM>obeya</EM>). The concept originated in Japan because of the perennial shortage of office space, which we mentioned earlier, but the company now uses it all over the world. Project teams also post information on the walls of a dedicated situation room for everyone to see—a practice known as <EM>mieruka</EM> (visualization).</P><H4>Give people the freedom to voice contrary opinions.</H4><P>Toyota’s communication system works because the organization is open to criticism. Employees feel safe, even empowered, to voice contrary opinions and contradict superiors. Each individual in Toyota is expected to act according to what he or she thinks is right. Every employee enjoys the prerogative to ignore the boss’s orders or not take them too seriously. Confronting your boss is acceptable; bringing bad news to the boss is encouraged; and ignoring the boss is often excused. In many of our interviews, employees told us how local operations had succeeded by refusing to obey orders or ignoring what headquarters had advised. For instance, the head of Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Yukitoshi Funo, told us candidly: “Before I was sent to the U.S. in 1997 [as senior vice president], I made the rounds of several top executives in Japan. They told me to increase the number of sales outlets. These were executive vice presidents and managing directors. I went to the market to see the situation. Increasing the number of dealerships would have caused more intense competition and threatened proper management of dealerships. I decided to ignore everything those top executives told me.” </P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P>Confronting your boss is acceptable; bringing bad news to the boss is encouraged; and ignoring the boss is often excused.</P></DIV></DIV><H4>Have frequent face-to-face interactions.</H4><P>Although there are no reprisals if local operations don’t act on headquarters’ advice or if subordinates disobey orders from supervisors, refusing to listen to others is a serious offense. Toyota’s system functions only when information from the source is available to everybody in the organization. The emphasis is therefore on interactions at the scene (<EM>genba</EM>). For instance, Tony Fujita, former vice president of Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., believes that Toyota distinguishes itself from American carmakers by listening to dealers. “Other carmakers have meetings with dealers, but I think Toyota is unique in the frequency and the seriousness of what we discuss [with them].”</P><H4>Make tacit knowledge explicit.</H4><P>Another element in Toyota’s nerve system is the practice of converting experiential or tacit knowledge into an explicit form to be shared throughout the organization. When Fujio Cho was president, Toyota put into writing the founders’ wisdom that had until then been passed down orally. Senior executives evaluated sayings and anecdotes and identified two core values as the pillars of <EM>The Toyota Way 2001:</EM> continuous improvement (<EM>kaizen</EM>) and respect for people.</P><H4>Create support mechanisms.</H4><P>In 2002, the company set up the Toyota Institute and the Global Knowledge Center at Toyota City in Japan and Torrance, California, respectively. Together with the University of Toyota, established four years earlier at Torrance by Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., these formal mechanisms support Toyota’s communication networks by disseminating best practices and company values. In addition, employees are encouraged to join a wide variety of informal groups, as we mentioned earlier. Every employee belongs to several committees (<EM>iinkai</EM>), self-organizing study groups (<EM>jishuken</EM>), and other social groups, of which there are close to 20 in the company. This helps create a multilayered communication network at Toyota.</P><H2>Emulating Toyota</H2><P>People often ask us, “Tell me one thing I should learn from Toyota.” That misses the point. Emulating Toyota isn’t about copying any one practice; it’s about creating a culture. That takes time. It requires resources. And it isn’t easy. First, companies have no choice but to embrace contradictions as a way of life. Most enterprises stop growing because they stick to processes and practices their past successes have generated. However, old methods also lead to institutional rigidities. Companies can overcome them by trying to reach new markets or by tackling fresh challenges. Second, companies must develop routines to resolve contradictions. Toyota uses numerous tools such as the Plan-Do-Check-Act model, the eight-step Toyota Business Practices process, the A3 reporting system, and the widely known ask-why-five-times routine. Unless companies teach employees how to deal with problems rigorously and systematically, they won’t be able to harness the power of contradictions. Third, companies must encourage employees to voice contrary opinions. Top managements must be open to criticism and hearing opposing viewpoints if they want new ideas. 
 <SPAN class=""contextbreak"">• • •</SPAN></P><P>Should companies try to do as Toyota does? We believe they should. Toyota’s culture of contradictions places humans, not machines, at the center of the company. As such, the company will be imperfect, and there will always be room for improvement. In that sense, Toyota’s model mirrors human creativity. Can you say the same about your company?</P><DIV class=""mvm description-text hbrgray, line-height-tight"">A version of this article appeared in the <A href=""/archive-toc/BR0806"">June 2008</A> issue of <EM>Harvard Business Review</EM>.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""authors mvl"" js-target=""authors-section""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""content-area--article column""><DIV class=""is-inline-block width-100pct""><P class=""mbn description-text space-for-headshot""><A href=""/search?term=hirotaka+takeuchi"" class=""font-size-xlarge line-height-tight"">Hirotaka Takeuchi</A> is a professor in the strategy unit of Harvard Business School.</P></DIV><DIV class=""is-inline-block width-100pct""><P class=""mbn description-text ""><SPAN class=""bodybold"">Emi Osono</SPAN> (<A xmlns="""" href=""mailto:osono@ics.hit-u.ac.jp"">osono@ics.hit-u.ac.jp</A>) is an associate professor;</P></DIV><DIV class=""is-inline-block width-100pct""><P class=""mbn description-text "">and <SPAN class=""bodybold"">Norihiko Shimizu</SPAN> (<A xmlns="""" href=""mailto:nshimizu@ics.hit-u.ac.jp"">nshimizu@ics.hit-u.ac.jp</A>) is a visiting professor at Hitotsubashi University’s Graduate School of International Corporate Strategy in Tokyo.

The brand’s nearest competitor was 2015’s largest automaker, Toyota, with production ending slightly higher than 10.2 million vehicles.</P><P data-reactid=""236"">To be fair, these numbers have their vagaries (the totals do not necessarily represent sales to consumers, but often just production), yet Volkswagen is very happy with the special attention. The prominence may come as a surprise to American consumers. Though the other global manufacturers in the list’s top three spots—Toyota and General Motors—both regularly maintain similar top-tier market positions in the U.S., VW has always struggled here.

VW’s deceitful system was purposely engineered to reduce emissions only when the vehicles were undergoing EPA testing. During normal driving, they would pollute the environment at levels up to 40 times greater than the strictures’ limits.</P><P data-reactid=""255"">Sales of diesel-powered vehicles have never been very high in the U.S.—in 2015 they accounted for just 3 percent of total new vehicles sold. Still, according to the Department of Transportation, VW had the highest proportion of diesel sales in the country, responsible for moving over half of all diesel-powered vehicles.</P><FIGURE class=""embedded-image"" data-id=""5894ec6f3926c56a61e9a1f4"" data-caption=""&lt;p&gt;Bentley is one of several car companies owned by VW.&lt;/p&gt;

(Costs to the brand in the U.S. alone have been estimated to reach as high as $20 billion.) Many consumers used this payout to purchase another nondiesel VW vehicle, but many did not. The end result was that, in the U.S., in a record-setting sales year for the automobile industry overall, Volkswagen sales dropped by nearly 8 percent.</P><P data-reactid=""266"">“Diesel vehicles accounted for about 25 percent of VW’s American sales,” says Caldwell. “But the scandal definitely affected their sales of other vehicle lines here as well in 2016.”</P><P data-reactid=""267"">Of course, the record-setting numbers are not just about the American marketplace. The Volkswagen Group sells a multitude of vehicles all over the world, including in equally large or even larger markets. These markets either were more forgiving of the diesel scandal (Europe) or were not affected (China, where VW does not sell many diesel vehicles). And while the brand certainly attends to sales in developed markets, it is concurrently seeking out shares in developing markets, where the opportunity to add first-time drivers—potentially for a lifetime—is exponentially larger. VW currently makes 40 percent of its global vehicle sales in China, and sales increased by a whopping 12 percent in that market in 2016. So if you’re looking for an answer to the group’s rebound, look east.</P><FIGURE class=""embedded-image"" data-id=""5894ed4c3926c56a61e9a1f6"" data-caption=""&lt;p&gt;Bugatti is another brand in the VW family.

It lends consumers confidence that you’re not some fly-by-night manufacturer.”</P><P data-reactid=""278"">Will VW ever succeed in gaining the prominence here that it seems to hold in the rest of the world? Well, the group’s product mix—from nearly all of its large- and small-volume brands in the U.S.—is definitely shifting toward more popular SUVs and Crossovers. (Even Bentley now offers one, and Lamborghini and Rolls Royce will soon as well.) So perhaps it’s possible. Some of it depends on how soon our compatriots’ memories are wiped clean.</P><P data-reactid=""279"">“Americans have a tendency to have a short attention span,” Caldwell says. “The fact is, that happened over a year ago now, and it’s starting to fade. It’s just all the news with the indictments and the fines that could bring it back into focus for Americans.” For now, however, VW is holding its place at the top of the leaderboard.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""article-after-content"" data-reactid=""282""><DIV class=""component-tags"" data-reactid=""283""><H2 class=""tags-title"" data-reactid=""284"">Explore</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
