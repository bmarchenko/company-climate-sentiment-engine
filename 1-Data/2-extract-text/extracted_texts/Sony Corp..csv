LONDON — Chocolate brand M&amp;Ms will promote wind power in a global advertising campaign set to run later this year and into 2018. </P><P> Chocolate and pet food giant Mars Inc this week <A href=""http://uk.businessinsider.com/mars-<mark>climate</mark>-change-investment-global-warming-sustainability-plan-greenhouse-gas-2017-9""> announced a $1 billion sustainability drive</A>, aiming to do its bit to tackle <mark>climate change</mark> and improve conditions for farmers in its supply chain. </P><P> As part of the plan, Mars' M&amp;Ms brand will &quot;champion the power of renewable energy and highlight the need for action in addressing <mark>climate change</mark>.&quot; </P><P> Barry Parkin, Mars' chief sustainability officer, told Business Insider: &quot;We're going to be using red and yellow. They're going to be enthusiastic advocates of wind power energy. Hopefully, it will continue to engage consumers in this important topic. We know consumers care about the planet and we're trying to do our part to help.&quot; </P><P> Mars plans to launch the campaign during the UN General Assembly in New York later this month when world leaders will be gathering to discuss <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P> Mars CEO Grant F. Reid said in a release announcing Mars' $1 billion sustainability drive: &quot;Through our much-loved M&amp;M's brand, we can inspire consumers on this important topic and shine the spotlight on renewable energy - one of the solutions that will help us to tackle <mark>climate change</mark> and meet the UN <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals.&quot; </P><P> Over the last decade, Mars has built two massive wind farms in Scotland and Texas to provide 100% renewable energy to its operations in the UK and US. The company plans to build similar wind farms in 11 more major markets around the world, such as Russia and India. </P><P> Parkin said: &quot;We're doing this at cost parity or better than fossil fuel. We're at an absolute tipping point here. Any company can switch to renewables without cost penalty if you do it in a smart way. This is absolutely the time for us and everyone else to accelerate.&quot; </P></DIV></SECTION></ARTICLE></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

			While the twenty-third Conference of the Parties (COP23) was beginning in Bonn, the US House and Senate Armed Services Committees were wrapping up negotiations on the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act. The <A href=""http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20171113/HRPT-115-HR2810.pdf"">bipartisan conference report</A> that emerged from those negotiations calls <mark>climate change</mark> “a direct threat to the national security of the United States [that] is impacting stability in areas of the world both where the United States Armed Forces are operating today, and where strategic implications for future conflict exist.”  For the past two weeks, much of the global conversation on <mark>climate change</mark> has focused on the talks in Bonn and how parties to the Paris Accord—from which the United States regrettably announced its intention to withdrawal—plan to meet their <mark>carbon</mark> reduction goals. However, the Armed Services Committees’ conference report emphasizes the national security risks associated with changing global temperatures.    That assessment should come as no surprise.  Countless reports have highlighted the potential negative impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on global stability.  To cite just one, the <A href=""http://archive.defense.gov/pubs/2014_Quadrennial_Defense_Review.pdf"">2014 Quadrennial Defense Review</A> called the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> “threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability, and social tensions – conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.”  The emergence of such conditions would place significant demands on the US military.  Take humanitarian assistance, for example.  One risk of <mark>climate change</mark> is its impact on the frequency and intensity of storms.  As the 2017 <A href=""https://science2017.globalchange.gov/""><mark>Climate</mark> Science Special Report</A> (CSSR) found: &quot;Both theory and numerical modeling simulations generally indicate an increase in tropical cyclone (TC) intensity in a warmer world, and the models generally show an increase in the number of very intense TCs. For Atlantic and eastern North Pacific hurricanes and western North Pacific typhoons, increases are projected in precipitation rates (high confidence) and intensity (medium confidence). The frequency of the most intense of these storms is projected to increase in the Atlantic and western North Pacific (low confidence) and in the eastern North Pacific (medium confidence).&quot; This year’s recent hurricane season brought reminders of the degree to which the national response to weather-induced crises relies on the military. Following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, the US Department of Defense (DOD) conducted search and rescue operations, transported food and water to affected areas, cleared roads, and repaired airports and sea ports. The hospital ship USNS Comfort provided critical medical care in Puerto Rico.  By the end of October, US Transportation Command had flown more than 2,800 flights in support of hurricane relief operations, and the Defense Logistics Agency had supplied more than 87 million meals and 10 million liters of water in Puerto Rico alone.  However, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief is not the only <mark>climate</mark>-related challenge likely to confront the military. There is also the threat that <mark>climate change</mark> will create conditions that expand the scope of military operations. The Center for Naval Analyses Military Advisory Board’s <A href=""https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/MAB_5-8-14.pdf"">report</A>, <EM>National Security and the Accelerating Risks of <mark>Climate Change</mark></EM>, discusses how changes in the Arctic could impact stability, warning that:&quot;As a warming planet affords increased access to the Arctic, the [Military Advisory Board] cannot rule out new disputes arising over natural resource exploration and recovery, fishing, and over future shipping lanes.&quot; If new demands on the force were not enough, <mark>climate change</mark> also threatens the infrastructure on which the military’s ability to respond is built. The DOD pointed this out in a 2016 study, which found that: “Built and natural infrastructure is at risk from a variety of potential <mark>climate change</mark> impacts. For built infrastructure, this could include potential impacts to energy, fuel, transportation, water supply, and utility services on installations.”  Just look at Naval Station Norfolk, the largest concentration of US naval forces in the world. The DOD itself has called sea level rise “a significant and pervasive threat multiplier to mission sustainability” at Norfolk.  In <A href=""http://features.weather.com/us-<mark>climate</mark>-change/virginia/"">the words</A> of former Naval Oceanographer Rear Admiral David Titley: “These guys are in a whole heap ton of trouble.” The defense bill identifies other <mark>climate</mark>-related impacts to defense infrastructure, including a $1 billion radar installation built on an atoll in the Marshall Islands, “projected to be underwater within two decades,” and a combination of sea level rise and loss of ice and permafrost that is eroding shorelines in the Arctic “damaging radar and communication installations, runways, seawalls, and training areas.”  Even for those who doubt the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>, inaction in the face of what must be recognized as substantial risks would run counter to sound military planning—and common sense.  As former Army Chief of Staff General Gordon Sullivan put it in a Center for Naval Analyses report: “If you wait until you have 100 percent certainty, something bad is going to happen on the battlefield.”  With that in mind, the defense bill is a step in the right direction. The bill requires DOD to prepare for the “the effects of a changing <mark>climate</mark> on threat assessments, resources, and readiness.” It requires DOD to produce a report identifying military installations most vulnerable to effects of <mark>climate change</mark> and describe potential mitigating measures.  In addition, the bill calls for the Department to assess how <mark>climate change</mark> will impact humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, theater campaign plans, contingency plans, and global posture.  While a report will not change the threat, maybe it will change some minds.<EM>Joe Bryan, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Center, formerly served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for energy.</EM></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

This agenda is driven by three questions. First, when states fail to address a global problem like <mark>climate change</mark>, either through multilateral agreements or national laws, why and how are actions nonetheless taken on the ground? Second, how does the interaction among global, national, and local actors determine the success of governance reform attempts? Third, how do ideas regarding the best way to tackle global problems, and the structures for implementing these ideas, evolve? To answer these questions, Kauffman examines how authority is structured and exercised in new, experimental global governance arrangements; how national and local systems intersect with and push against these global structures; how power is distributed and flows within transnational governance networks; the politics of creating collaborative, multi-level governance arrangements; norm contestation and evolution; and ecological economics. He is particularly interested in how these issues shape the politics and policies relating to <mark>climate change</mark> and <mark>sustainable</mark> development.</P><P>Kauffman is the author of <EM>Grassroots Global Governance: Local Watershed Management Experiments and the Evolution of <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development </EM>(Oxford University Press, 2016). His articles have appeared or are forthcoming in <EM>Global Environmental Politics, World Development, Latin American Research Review, Environmental Research Notes, Agricultural Water Management</EM>, <EM>Peace Review</EM>, <EM>Encyclopedia of Political Theory</EM>, and elsewhere. Kauffman is a member of the United Nations Knowledge Network on Harmony with Nature, tasked with providing recommendations on implementing Earth Law as a means for implementing the Post-2015 <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Agenda. His research has been supported by the Inter-American Foundation, the Rotary Foundation, <mark>Sony Corpo</mark>ration, the University of Oregon, and the Latin American School of Social Sciences-Ecuador (FLACSO-Ecuador).</P><P>Kauffman’s book, <EM>Grassroots Global Governance</EM>, shows how when international agreements fail to solve global problems like <mark>climate change</mark>, transnational networks attempt to address them by implementing “global ideas”—policies and best practices negotiated at the global level—locally around the world. <EM>Grassroots Global Governance</EM> not only explains why some efforts succeed while others fail, but also why the process of implementing global ideas locally causes these ideas to evolve. The book shows how transnational actors’ success in putting global ideas into practice depends on the strategies they use to activate networks of grassroots actors influential in local social and policy arenas. Yet, grassroots actors neither accept nor reject global ideas as presented by outsiders. Instead, they negotiate whether and how to adapt them to fit local conditions. This contestation produces experimentation with unique institutional applications of a global idea infused with local norms and practices. Local experiments that endure are perceived as “successful,” allowing those involved to activate transnational networks to scale up and diffuse innovative local governance models globally. These models carry local norms and practices to the international level where they challenge existing global approaches. By explaining how this occurs, the book reveals the grassroots level as an important but often overlooked terrain where global governance is constructed.</P><P>Kauffman’s current book project analyzes new global governance structures created to institutionalize Earth Law (Rights of Nature) in order to alter the way we practice <mark>sustainable</mark> development and address <mark>climate change</mark>. The project analyzes the global Rights of Nature movement and its effort to incorporate rights of nature into laws and institutions at both the domestic and international levels. Because rights of nature is rooted in non-Western understandings of humans’ relationship with nature, the book’s theoretical argument provides an alternative to explanations of normative change rooted in the literatures on human rights and sovereignty norms. Empirically, the book analyzes the institutionalization of Earth Law/rights of nature in Ecuador, Bolivia, New Zealand, Australia, and the U.S., as well as efforts at the international level.</P><P>Kauffman also has several projects relating to ecological economics. He is part of an inter-disciplinary team developing an original dataset to analyze the effect of international conservation aid on tropical deforestation worldwide. This project builds on Kauffman’s research on innovative, experimental financing mechanisms for conserving forest and watershed ecosystem</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""profile-section""><H2>Education</H2><DIV class=""content""><UL><LI>Ph.D., Political Science, The George Washington University, 2012</LI><LI>M.S., Institute for Conflict Analysis and Resolution, George Mason University, 1996</LI><LI>B.A., Religious Studies, The College of Wooster, 1992</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""footer"" class=""bg-overflow""><DIV class=""inner""><DIV id=""footer-widgets""><DIV class=""widget""><FORM role=""search"" method=""get"" id=""searchform"" class=""searchform"" action=""https://polisci.uoregon.edu/""><DIV><LABEL class=""screen-reader-text"" for=""s"">Search for:</LABEL></DIV></FORM></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

A joint initiative of WRI and the World Business Council for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development, the GHG Protocol was established to develop and promote the use of best practices for accounting and reporting GHG emissions. It since has become the preeminent standards-setting organization in the field of GHG accounting, with the Corporate Standard considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for corporate emissions measurement around the world.</P><P>The <A href=""https://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2013/08/14/green-investors-push-firms-ghg-emissions-supply-chain"">GHG accounting field</A> has changed substantially over the past 15 years.

Today, at least 85 percent of companies reporting to the CDP use the Corporate Standard, as do numerous other companies.</P><P>Building on the success of the Corporate Standard, the GHG Protocol published the <A href=""https://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2011/10/04/ghg-protocol-launches-long-awaited-value-chain-product-standards"">Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) and Product Life Cycle Standards</A> in 2011, which helps businesses evaluate the indirect emissions associated with their value chains. GHG Protocol also has developed many sector-specific supplements to these standards — such as those that apply to the agriculture and public sectors. It also introduced the Built on GHG Protocol mark to recognize the growing body of guidance that is based on the standards, but developed by other organizations. Most recently, we have started to develop two new standards on mitigation accounting for policy makers and a standard on city- and community-scale GHG accounting. In short, GHG Protocol's standards have defined internationally accepted best practices and are the basis for emissions management in many sectors. </P><P><STRONG>The impact of corporate greenhouse gas emissions accounting</STRONG></P><P>Using the GHG Protocol standards, companies are able to determine their GHG emissions profile, identify reduction opportunities and set and track progress toward reduction targets.

Technologies related to electric vehicles are a typical example of CCMT technologies related to Transport.  Renewable Energy includes technologies in areas such as hydro energy, wind energy, solar energy and geothermal energy.  In Buildings, emission reductions are gained through better lighting, heating, ventilation systems as well as better elevators, escalators and increased thermal performance in general.    Traditional Energy includes improvements in fossil-fuel technologies and alternatives such as nuclear energy.  Clean Energy Enablers are technologies related to energy conversion or management systems that are also designed to reduce greenhouse gases.  Technologies related to batteries are example of technologies that would fall under this category as batteries are considered an alternative to using other types of energies that are more polluting.  Smart Grids are related to the imporvement of technologies related to an electrical supply network using digital communication technology.  Using communication technologies to optimize electricity usage ultimately empowers consumers to more effictiently control energy use thereby reducing the likelihood of outages. <SUP id=""fn13-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn13""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>13</A></SUP> Finally, <mark>Carbon</mark> Capture related technologies are designed to capture waste CO<SUB>2</SUB> and other greenhouse gases and inject it into deep underground rock formations for permanent storage. <SUP id=""fn14-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn14""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>14</A></SUP></P><P>The Canadian researcher data used in this report was obtained from Antoine Dechezleprêtre, Associate Professorial Research Fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the Environment at the London School of Economics, and co-author of the UNEP and EPO report.  The analysis focuses on patent applications filed between January 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2012.  The dataset consists of 7,873 high-value invention (HVI) patent applications with at least one Canadian researcher filed over the time span translating into 2,184 HVI patent families.  A patent family represents one or more published patents related to the same invention with a shared priority.  This report uses the same fractional counting approach as in the UNEP and EPO report for assigning patented inventions to inventors in cases where multiple inventors from various countries jointly filed a patent.  Using the fractional counting approach, the 2,184 HVI patent families equates to 608 HVI patent families.  This approach uses information on the inventor's country of residence or origin to determine in which country a patented invention has been developed.  For example,  in the case where a patent is filed by a Canadian, an American, and a Japanese inventor, Canada would be assigned one third of the ownership of the patent, the United States would also retain one third of the ownership, and Japan would retain the final third of the ownership.</P><P>In addition to examining CCMT patenting activity by researchers, this report examines the CCMT patent data from the perspective of business inventive activity.  The Derwent <mark>Innovation</mark> database was used to extract patent families that were filed in more than one country and where the basic patent, or the first member of the patent family, was filed between 2008 and 2012.  We refer to these patent families as high-value inventions.  The dataset consists of 99,935 high-value inventions in CCMT.  The Canadian businesses dataset represents approximately 1%, or 1,140 high-value inventions, of the total number of patent families worlwide involved in CCMT.  This is approximately half the size of the Canadian researcher dataset.  Similar to the researcher data, the business data is limited to patent filed between January 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2012.  An absolute counting approach is used to assess the patented inventions to businesses.  The reason for not using the fractional counting approach for the business analysis is because the IP is associated with the company's country of origin based on its headquarter's location.</P><P>Time was spent treating the data to ensure that proper country codes were attributed to businesses. This is due to cases of missing address information as reported by the office where the basic patent was applied. Treatment included creating a database of business names from the dataset and attributing a country code to those businesses that were without a country code but that have already appeared somewhere in the dataset with one.  In doing so, the percentage of businesses without an address dropped from 5% to less than 1%.</P><H2 id=""toc-5"">Methodology</H2><H3>Patent analytics</H3><P>The development and adoption of new technologies are required to meet current and future environmental challenges. <SUP id=""fn15-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn15""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>15</A></SUP> Patent data is a good starting point for analysis of the development of new technologies as it provides important information on the specific <mark>innovation</mark> in the invention and who the inventors and applicant are.  Like any data source patent data has its strengths and weaknesses and if used in the wrong way it can lead to erroneous conclusions and poor policy.  The following provides context on the use of patents in understanding <mark>innovation</mark>.</P><P>While patents measure the flow of new ideas, it has been argued that patents may not measure <mark>innovation</mark> for three important reasons: patents do not include non-patented <mark>innovation</mark>s, not all patents result in commercialization, and many patents are strategic in nature. <SUP id=""fn16-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn16""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>16</A></SUP> For this reason the analysis is based on patent families that include applications in at least two jurisdictions.  This makes it more likely that these patent families will be a higher-valued invention and that the firm expects to commercialize the invention. <SUP id=""fn17-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn17""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>17</A></SUP></P><P>Another challenge presented is that many <mark>innovation</mark>s or inventions remain hidden as trade secrets.  These <mark>innovation</mark>s will be missed in a measure that includes only patents.  However, a 2008 study indicates that world-first innovators patent more frequently. Conversely, firms that patent infrequently tend to be imitators. <SUP id=""fn18-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn18""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>18</A></SUP> In addition, the study finds that firms that protect their intellectual property are more likely to increase their profits than those that do not.  In addition, SMEs that patent are more likely to be high-growth firms, which is important for success. <SUP id=""fn19-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn19""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>19</A></SUP> These conclusions are reinforced by a Canadian study that noted that firms that are aggressive innovators, introducing radically new products that involve patent protection, have higher profits. <SUP id=""fn20-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn20""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>20</A></SUP> Finally, while some inventions are not patented, patents are obtained for almost all economically significant inventions. <SUP id=""fn21-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn21""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>21</A></SUP></P><P>Below are the primary ways to view or interpret patent data:</P><DL><DT><STRONG>Market Reach</STRONG></DT><DD>Patent filings in foreign markets are a good indicator of firms accessing those markets.  Surveys have shown that firms that hold patents are more likely to be exporters <SUP id=""fn22-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn22""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>22</A></SUP> .</DD><DT><STRONG>Innovative Activity</STRONG></DT><DD>When we do not account for filings in multiple jurisdictions we are double and triple counting the number of patented inventions or innovative activities.  In order to address this patent data allows for the formation of patent families where by each family includes all related or similar patents in all jurisdictions.</DD><DT><STRONG>Scientific Strength</STRONG></DT><DD>It is possible to identify the researchers or scientists, rather than the company or applicant.  While these can be the same, they are often different.  In this way we can see the inventive activity of Canadian researchers working in other countries or for non-Canadian companies.</DD><DT><STRONG>Relative Advantage</STRONG></DT><DD>Canada is a small open-economy.  For this reason it is unlikely that our industries or innovators would have an absolute advantage in a particular area, be the most prolific IP users or have the largest global market share.  However, there are areas where we have a comparative or relative advantage.  Much work has been done in the creation of metrics of relative technological advantage and relative specialization.</DD></DL><H3>Patent families</H3><P>The analysis of businesses and institutions is based on Derwent <mark>Innovation</mark>'s patent family data. These families are defined as drawing together patents covering the same invention and their relationship is defined by the priority or application details claimed by each document.  A patent family can be tagged to multiple classifications.  For this reason, it is important to note that when we say patent, we actually mean a patent linked to the specific classification regardless of if it was tagged to another one.</P><P>Similar to the EPO report, the patent family data in this report was used to construct statistics for &quot;high-value&quot; inventions.  High-value inventions are defined as patent families that are filed in more than one jurisdiction.  Although it can be said that patents are not all of high-value, it is rare to find that a successful invention was not patented.  This idea along with our methodology for using only patent families filed in more than one jurisdiction justifies our assumption that the patents in our datasets are high-value inventions.  Although it is very difficult to quickly identify the value of patents within a large dataset, it is a safe assumption that patents filed in multiple jurisdictions are likely to be of higher value than patents filed in only one jurisdiction.  By omitting patents filed in only one jurisdiction from the dataset, it was possible to limit the dataset to high-value inventions.</P><H3>Revealed technological advantage</H3><P>In order to gain a better understanding of Canada's strengths in CCMT research, we use the Revealed Technological Advantage (RTA) index, which was developed by the OECD and uses patenting intensity to allow for industries to be compared between countries of different sizes on a relative basis.  The index is calculated as a correction for the absolute numbers of HVI patent families in order to account for the fact that some countries file more patent applications than others in all fields of technology.  In this report the RTA index is used to determine where Canadians have a comparative advantage over competitors.  This report compares Canada's RTA index for each CCMT category to that of the G7 countries along with four other countries, China, Korea, Australia and Denmark.  China and Korea are included in the comparison because they are two prolific patenting countries.   Australia is also included because of its IPO's similarities with the Canadian IPO in terms of size and activity levels.  Finally, Denmark is included because of its specialization in the area of CCMT.</P><P>The formula used to calculate the RTA is as follows:</P><DL><DT><STRONG>Numerator</STRONG></DT><DD>The sum of HVI patent families for a category (or subgroup) in Canada divided by the sum of HVI patent families for the category (or subgroup) in the world</DD><DT><STRONG>Denominator</STRONG></DT><DD>The sum of HVI patent families in Canada divided by the sum of HVI patent families in the world

Since its publication, this essay has had a profound influence on much of our thinking about the global economy and sustainability. Its vision of the “spaceship earth” was essential to shaping the sustainability concept of the 1960s and 1970s in <A href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v527/n7579/full/527443a.html"" target=""_blank"">seminal classics of that time</A>.</P><P>In perhaps the most famous passage of the essay, Boulding describes the open economy of the past—with its seemingly unlimited resources—and contrasts it with the closed economy of the future. He wrote, &quot;I am tempted to call the open economy the 'cowboy economy,' the cowboy being symbolic of the illimitable plains and also associated with reckless, exploitative, romantic, and violent behavior, which is characteristic of open societies. The closed economy of the future might similarly be called the 'spaceman' economy, in which the earth has become a single spaceship, without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for <mark>pollution</mark>, and in which, therefore, man must find his place in a cyclical ecological system which is capable of continuous reproduction of material form even though it cannot escape having inputs of energy.&quot;</P><P>Boulding’s essay was influential for two reasons. First, as he emphasized in his opening sentence, transitioning to a more <mark>sustainable</mark> economy requires humankind to rethink its relationship with nature: “We are now in the middle of a long process of transition in the nature of the image which man has of himself and his environment.” Second, as an economist, Boulding recognized that the main impetus for change must occur in the basic production and consumption relationships of modern economies: “The closed earth of the future requires economic principles which are somewhat different from those of the open earth of the past.”</P></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-image--two""><DIV class=""container""><FOOTER class=""image-caption""><DIV class=""l-1up""><SPAN class=""caption""><SPAN>

As prudential authorities and regulators of financial systems, central banks can advance this objective by establishing requirements for environmental risk management and reporting, incorporating impacts of natural disasters and <mark>climate change</mark> considerations into financial stress tests across institutions, adjusting capital provisioning to account for underpriced environmental risks, initiating prudential reviews of the impact of sustainability factors on financial stability, and stimulating markets for specific assets (such as green bonds) through asset purchases.</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article-blockquote--right""><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-paragraphs-item-field-quote""><P>Common international approaches are needed to evaluate environmental impacts and inform decisionmaking.</P></DIV><A href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Common+international+approaches+are+needed+to+evaluate+environmental+impacts+and+inform+decisionmaking.%20via%20@RFF_org&amp;url=http://www.rff.org/research/publications/economic-principles-spaceship-earth"" class=""twitter-link"" target=""_blank"">
Tweet</A></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Because banks and investors rely extensively on company disclosures to evaluate environmental risk, a need exists for common international approaches with standardized data and risk measures to evaluate environmental impacts and inform decisionmaking. This requires governments to coordinate and develop common practical frameworks, methodologies, and tools to provide a systematic approach to monitor and integrate environmental factors into credit and investment risk assessments.</P><P>Already, there are efforts to develop international guidelines and common policy and legal frameworks. In February 2016, finance ministers and central banks governors of the G20 major economies met in Shanghai and <A href=""http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2016/160227-finance-en.html"" target=""_blank"">committed to developing such frameworks</A> to green the $90 trillion of investments required over the next 15 years to achieve global <mark>sustainable</mark> development and <mark>climate</mark> objectives. The G20 has also launched the Green Finance Study Group, co-chaired by China and the United Kingdom, to explore ways of mobilizing private capital for green investments.</P><H2>Toward New Economic Principles</H2><P>As Boulding predicted over 50 years ago, our perception of the world must change, from a limitless frontier to a “spaceship earth.” The new set of economic principles that underlie this concept must involve a greater role for the private sector, including corporate environmental responsibility and stewardship, improved environmental assessments that factor in the true cost of resource and environmental use, and investments in green assets, technologies, and <mark>innovation</mark>. In recent years, the opportunities for businesses to capitalize on these initiatives have proliferated.</P><P>If we hope to achieve more <mark>sustainable</mark> economic development, these new economic principles must create sufficient incentives for future expansion in production and consumption, as well as investment decisions, to be decoupled from increased resource use, wasteful production, and <mark>pollution</mark>. Policies to advance green R&amp;D and <mark>innovation</mark>, disseminate existing technologies more quickly throughout the developing world, and provide the governance framework for green financing are fundamental to facilitate the transition to a more <mark>sustainable</mark> trajectory.</P><P>Now we must urgently tackle the next challenge, of fostering these new principles to accompany the vision. <mark>Innovation</mark>, technological adoption, and financial investment—led by private enterprise with support from public policy and the right incentives—can launch the spaceship earth on a more <mark>sustainable</mark> and prosperous path.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""l-mag-main grouped print-only""><SPAN class=""print-message"">For more information about this article and others—including links, interactive features, and references—view <SPAN>Resources</SPAN> online at www.rff.org/resources.</SPAN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Companies with SBTs are at the very forefront of global <mark>climate</mark> action, taking steps now to align their strategies with the goals of the Paris deal and giving themselves a competitive advantage in the race ahead.</P><P>AkzoNobel, BT, and EDP are among the 151 companies included in the sample that have joined the initiative, up from 94 last year. An additional 30% – 317 companies – anticipate setting a science-based target within two years. With the companies in the sample representing 12% of global greenhouse gas emissions, that’s a huge amount of emissions that will be prevented if these commitments are fulfilled.</P><P><STRONG>Transitioning to the low-<mark>carbon</mark> market </STRONG></P><P>CDP’s analysis also shows how the race to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy is driving <mark>innovation</mark>: both in low-<mark>carbon</mark> products, and in the use of renewable energy. Over a third of companies now generate revenue from low-<mark>carbon</mark> products such as electric vehicles and zero-energy buildings.</P><P>Even those companies that cannot so easily shift towards lower-<mark>carbon</mark> products can significantly reduce both their <mark>climate</mark> impact and costs by using energy from renewable sources. The number of companies with targets for renewable energy consumption has risen by 23% and there is an even greater rise (36%) in corporates setting goals to produce their own renewable energy. For example, BT and Unilever have committed to sourcing 100% renewable energy by 2030 as part of the RE100 Initiative.</P><P>One of the things driving this development is <mark>carbon</mark> pricing: 32% of companies analysed by CDP are now using internal <mark>carbon</mark> pricing, with another 18% saying they plan to implement it within the next two years. An internal price on <mark>carbon</mark> provides a straightforward tool for financial directors to assess the sensitivity of their business model to current and future low-<mark>carbon</mark> regulation.</P><P><STRONG><mark>Climate</mark> leaders and laggards </STRONG></P><P>As with any race, we are beginning to see winners and losers emerging as the pace accelerates.</P><P>This month CDP also released its environmental A List for 2017, naming 160 companies as leaders for their approaches to <mark>climate change</mark>, water security and deforestation. The 160 A List companies include Colgate Palmolive, Diageo, J Sainsbury, Sky and <mark>Sony Corpo</mark>ration. Unilever and L’Oréal lead the way as the only two companies to achieve A grades across all three areas of <mark>climate change</mark>, water and forests.</P><P>The A Listers demonstrate how business can reduce <mark>CO2</mark> emissions, increase water security and tackle deforestation whilst making a profit. For example, since Water A Lister Nissan launched its Leaf electric car in 2010 it has sold almost a quarter of a million electric vehicles (EVs) and become the leading manufacturer of mass-market EVs.</P><P>Meanwhile, for those companies who fail to plan for a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy, the transition risks posed by accelerating <mark>climate change</mark> are becoming more severe. The energy sector by and large still has a long way to go – both in terms of disclosing the risk to their business models from <mark>climate change</mark> and the low-<mark>carbon</mark> transition, but also in terms of actually shifting investments to lower-<mark>carbon</mark> modes of energy generation. The sector remains significantly exposed to regulatory threats such as tightening rules on emissions and <mark>carbon</mark> pricing.</P><P><STRONG>The best laid <mark>climate</mark> plans </STRONG></P><P>While it is good news that 89% of the world’s biggest, most environmentally-impactful companies now have <mark>carbon</mark> emissions targets, a target is only significant if it is successfully met. The data that companies disclose to CDP is critical to monitoring this process and ensuring that companies continue to pick up the pace on <mark>climate</mark> action.</P><P>As a part of the disclosure cycle, financial directors are in a key position to help ensure that corporate <mark>climate</mark> action is timely and comprehensive, and builds long-term financial and environmental sustainability for their companies.</P><P> </P><P> </P><P><EM>Marcus Norton </EM><EM>is C</EM><EM>hief Partnerships Officer &amp; General Counsel</EM><EM> at <A href=""http://www.cdp.net"">CDP,</A> a </EM><EM>non-profit global environmental disclosure platform</EM><EM>. </EM></P></SPAN><P class=""article__tag-title"">Tags</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

With its music, pictures, computer entertainment and online businesses, Sony is uniquely positioned to be the leading electronics and entertainment company in the world. Sony recorded consolidated annual sales of approximately $72 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. We spoke to Keiko Shiga from Sony’s Quality &amp; Environmental Department about the company’s science based targets.</P><DIV class=""targets_block""><P><STRONG>The targets</STRONG></P><P>Sony commits to reduce GHG emissions from its operations by 42% below fiscal year 2000 levels by fiscal year 2020.</P><P>The company also commits to reduce annual energy consumption of its products by 30% below fiscal year 2013 levels by fiscal year 2020.</P><P>The company also has a long-term vision of reducing its environmental footprint to zero by 2050, requiring a 90% reduction in emissions from 2008 levels by 2050 (scopes 1, 2, and 3).</P></DIV><P><STRONG>Why did you decide to set a science-based target?</STRONG></P><P>We didn’t actually set out to set a science-based target in response to a call from the Initiative. We already had “Road to Zero”, our global environmental plan for achieving a zero environmental footprint by 2050, which we announced in 2010, and we were working towards this. We knew our “Green Management” mid-term targets had to be ambitious in order to put us on track to achieve the radical reduction in emissions necessary by the middle of the century.</P><P>We are part of WWF’s <mark>Climate</mark> Savers Program and we were speaking to them about our targets for 2020 and they said: ‘these look science-based.’ We didn’t realize this but agreed to submit the targets for a quality check and they were approved! We successfully hit our 2015 targets for <mark>climate change</mark>, and are now on track to delivering more reductions.</P><P>We believe it is essential to act on <mark>climate change</mark> and to do so quickly. It is central to our identity as a company that seeks to make a connection with people. Our customers don’t just look for functional value but deeper and more elusive emotional value. In Japanese culture, we call this ‘kando’. Being environmentally aware and responsible is one of the most important ways to achieve this.</P><P><STRONG>What was the process for setting and implementing the ambitious targets?</STRONG></P><P>The basic foundation of the Green Management mid-term targets was developed by the Quality &amp; Environmental Department, involving business groups and relevant divisions in the discussions as needed. We also talked with some stakeholders about their expectations for Sony and benchmarked what other advanced companies are doing for environmental initiatives. Then we took it to the Group Executive Committee at one of their monthly meetings.</P><P>The CEO was instrumental in getting other executives on board. For him, it was central to what Sony is and does.
Without his backing it would have been harder to get other leaders on board.</P><P>Across the company, people are behind the targets and agree with the idea that we have to radically reduce our emissions. We provide e-Learning on Green Management mid-term targets to keep awareness and momentum high. Of course, in the shorter-term the specific targets and reductions require negotiation and explanation.</P><P><STRONG>What changed as a result of having an official quality checked science-based target?</STRONG></P><P>In some ways not much changed. We were already working towards the Road to Zero, and so the internal processes were in place to deliver this. However, having targets approved by a global initiative, as being science-based and in line with the level of ambition necessary to prevent dangerous <mark>climate change</mark> gave us more confidence and greater authority. This was particularly important in the context of COP 21 and the Paris Agreement, which saw an increase in awareness around the need to act.</P><P><STRONG>What benefits do you anticipate or have you already reaped from having a science-based target?</STRONG></P><P>This is something our customers want. It is important for our brand value. We need to fulfill our mission to provide the products customers want. And because these products are more energy efficient we are also helping to reduce global emissions, so it’s a win-win.</P><P>It puts us in a good position vis-à-vis our competitors, and also regulators. It means we meet and try to surpass what stakeholders expect of us, keep offering the best to our customers, and in doing so, get ahead of what other companies are doing. We also save money, because of energy efficiency.</P><P>Having a science-based target helps keep us on track. It means we know what we need to do in the short and medium term to meet the longer-term vision. And it also helps convince people internally that we are doing this in a logical manner. By being part of the global initiative we know we are part of a bigger movement, and that if we all work together we can deliver the reductions necessary.</P><P><STRONG>Did you encounter any challenges?</STRONG></P><P>Sony’s long-term vision implies a radically new way of doing business. Achieving this vision will demand changes beyond the company’s control and require collaboration with key stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, consumers, suppliers, governments and civil society.For example, we have targets for our supplying partners to meet, which is a challenge. We will have to work with them to convey the importance of reducing emissions in the supply chain. We cannot do this alone and building partnership will be key to get others to act.</P><P>Another challenge is that customers want bigger products in categories like TVs, with more vibrant displays, but they also want energy efficiency and lower emissions.</P><P>We have to try hard to deliver both. We also have to work out ways to ensure that our emissions keep going down even as the number of products our factories produce goes up.</P><P>We have absolute rather than intensity targets, so we have to cut emissions even when we grow. We will have to continue to innovate and work very hard to hit targets but I am confident we will do it – as we always have in the past.</P><P><STRONG>Can you give some examples of <mark>innovation</mark>s that have occurred as a result of the targets?</STRONG></P><P>We have developed new LED displays for our TVs, which are more energy efficient, without compromising on picture quality. For example, the smart screens in the 4K BRAVIA™ TV X85B series adjust LED backlight brightness frame by frame to avoid wasting energy, and use 20% less energy than previous models (compared to X85A series in standard viewing mode).</P><P>We have also developed our own recycled plastic, SORPLAS, which is made from up to 99% recycled material and saves up to 80% <mark>CO2</mark> emissions during manufacturing. This is used in many of our products and we are now also selling this outside the Sony Group.</P><P>Our environmental targets apply to all Sony companies – not just electronics, but also entertainment companies such as music and motion picture businesses. These divisions have the same emission reduction targets for operation, but they also have their own specific target – to “raise awareness and inspire action on sustainability from over 500 million people through entertainment”. For example, the main character from our film Angry Birds has become a UN Ambassador for the International Day of Happiness and is part of a campaign for greater sustainability.

By doing so, we can pressure the big banks to stop investing in fossil fuels and nuclear energy companies and adopt environmentally responsible investment policies.</P><P>For this blog, we’ve asked 350 Japan’s three core members to tell us about their “divestment story” and thoughts on the campaign.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG><SPAN style=""color: #3db0df; font-size: large; line-height: 200%;""><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Q、Could you tell us which account at which bank did you choose to change to? Also, could you please tell us about the thinking behind the choice?</SPAN></SPAN></STRONG></P><P><B>Shin: </B>All of us chose to go with <A href=""http://moneykit.net/?device=c"">Sony Bank. </A>In addition to being an <A href=""https://letsdivest.jp/en/pdf/EN_45BankList.pdf"">“earth friendly bank”</A> with no recorded investments in fossil fuels or nuclear energy, Sony has a business goal of reducing the electricity consumption of its operations and off-setting 100% of its <mark>CO2</mark> emissions. Sony Bank had actually been proactively tackling these sorts of environmental problems since 2008, and in practical terms their international money transfer services were fairly good, so it was easy to switch. Additionally, not only the bank, but the parent company, <mark>Sony Corpo</mark>ration, itself has been committed to tackling <mark>climate change</mark> for a while, so that was one more reason to change banks.</P><P style=""text-align: center;""><SPAN style=""color: #434343; font-size: large; line-height: 200%;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""><A href=""https://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/csr_report/environment/management/vision.html"">Source: Sony home page.</A></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><B>Ian: </B>I didn’t want to have all my eggs in one basket, so I have two banks; one for my day-to-day transactions and one for savings. My savings are going into a fixed deposit account at <A href=""http://www.aeonbank.co.jp/loan/lp/card_loan3.html?trcd=lc101722973"">Æon Bank</A>. I chose Æon because it’s easily accessible both from convenience store ATMs and from online services. Also, according a to a survey of supermarkets carried out by Greenpeace, Æon was noted for its contribution to sustainability, and in addition I saw in the news that they carried out projects with roots in local communities, so I felt like I wanted to be a part of a company like that by opening an account with them.</P><P>For my transaction account I use Sony Bank. After opening an account with them, they kindly send an email each week explaining how to use their online services and the account. Also, they send frequent portfolio rankings and have good rates for people who need to exchange foreign currencies.</P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""color: #434343; font-size: large; line-height: 200%;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> </SPAN></SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: center;""><SPAN style=""color: #434343; font-size: large; line-height: 200%;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""><A href=""http://act-greenpeace.jp/ocean/ranking6/"">Source: Japan for Sustainability</A></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><B>Marie:</B> In addition to Sony Bank, I also opened an account with a local credit union. One reason is that it supports community projects in my area. The local economy in my area is struggling, so I was impressed by their activities contributing to the community, so I made a savings account with them.</P><P><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline; font-size: large;""><SPAN style=""color: #3db0df; line-height: 200%; text-decoration: underline;""><B>Q、How long did it take to make a new account?</B></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><B>Ian: </B>With Sony Bank, we were able to apply for an account straight away. Since we’re Japanese citizens and residents, we were able to open accounts with minimal information. Assuming everything goes smoothly, you can get your card from Æon Bank and Sony Bank in as little as two weeks.</P><P><B>Marie:</B>Applying online took 15 minutes. Even though it was a busy period, I got my card in a month. I was also paying my gas, water and electricity bills by direct deposit from a big bank, so from calling my companies and submitting my forms it took about two months to set up my new account as my main bank.</P><P><B>Shin: </B>Since I’m an Australian citizen I couldn’t complete my application online. First I had to apply online and wait about a week to get the forms I needed. From there, I had to get together copies of my ID for the application and send it back, which all up took about 2 weeks. From when I first applied the whole process took about a month.</P><P><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline; font-size: large; color: #3db0df;""><SPAN style=""line-height: 200%;""><B>Q、Was there anything you found particularly hard about the process of setting up an account?</B></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><B>Ian: </B>It was the first time I had used an online bank, so in both cases I wasn’t used to the process for creating a “one-time password,” but once I’d done it the first time it was OK. Also, I wouldn’t exactly say I struggled with it, but if I had to say something that was hard, I think remembering transaction numbers and Sony member numbers and login passwords and one-time passwords all at once took a bit of time. But once I got used to it, it was convenient!</P><P><B>Marie: </B>Not particularly. The process for changing my public utilities payments went on a bit, but that was about it.</P><P><B>Shin:</B> I think if you follow the instructions on the bank’s site, the process is pretty simple. I think the hardest thing was choosing the right bank.</P><P><B>Ian: </B>For someone like me who is impatient and doesn’t like reading, it was more fun to do it with a friend. It was a lot easier for me since I was able to check things with them as we went along.</P><P><B>Shin: </B>At 350, we’re also making materials to make changing banks easier to understand. <A href=""https://letsdivest.jp/en/pdf/EN_45BankList.pdf"">We’re putting out a fact-sheet called “I want to choose an environmentally responsible bank”</A>that summarizes our list of 45 “earth-friendly” banks and details about their products, so that people can understand all the differences between online banks, credit unions and regional banks. （If you visit the official website at <A href=""http://www.letsdivest.jp"">www.letsdivest.jp/en</A> you can register and get all of this information for free)</P><P>Our “Divestment Guide” sets out the whole process comprehensively in three steps. “Choose a Bank.”“Transfer Your Account.”“Let Us Know.” Of course after making the decision to change, you will need to follow all of the processes of each bank carefully. I hope that this guide will help support those people who have made the decision that they do actually want to change. Also, we’re planning <A href=""http://letsdivest.jp/en"">events</A> where people who have decided to switch can meet and exchange experiences from the 6th of November to the 12th of December.</P><P> </P><P><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline; font-size: large;""><SPAN style=""color: #3db0df; line-height: 200%; text-decoration: underline;""><B>Q、Can you go into more detail about your thoughts on this campaign?</B></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><B>Marie:</B> Our main objective is to have 100 people and 5 organizations make the decision to divest by the 12th of December. It’s the first time that we will be announcing figures for how many people are divesting, so it will be interesting to see what kind of effect it has.<SPAN style=""font-weight: 400; color: #434343; font-size: large; line-height: 200%;""> </SPAN></P><P><B>Ian: I</B> think there are a lot of people who do things like choosing renewable energy, riding a bike instead of driving or becoming vegetarian because they want to take action against <mark>climate change</mark>. I think this campaign is going to add “choosing a different bank” to that list of actions an individual can take.</P><P>Also, the “Let’s divest!” campaign is primarily driven by people who are already taking a leadership role by being active and volunteering for 350. It’s my hope that this will increase the number of people who are independently active and vocal about environmental issues in Japan.</P><P>I think modern consumers often, in a way, have their choices already made for them, so their own opinions and preferences aren’t really being expressed through those choices. I think as more people decide “I want to make conscious choices” about consumption, society will change more. That’s why with this campaign I want to spread the idea of “consciously choosing your bank.”</P><P> </P><P><B>Shin: </B>There’s a catchphrase for the divestment campaign. “If you change your account, you can change society.”When you’re just one person taking action you can feel very small, but when a lot of people make the same choice or take the same action, you can change the behavior of companies. If the demands of society can change, it can have an effect on the economy as a whole.</P><P>In order to do that, the first thing we have to do is get everyday people to change their behavior. It’s everyday people in their role as consumers who make demands on companies, which companies then respond to by changing their services and products. Through that power, everyday people can lead companies. I think that’s their role in social change. The aim of this round of <A href=""http://letsdivest.jp"">“Let’s Divest”</A>activism is to get together people who want to change to an Earth-Friendly bank and together communicate to the major banks that “we want you to conduct <mark>sustainable</mark> investment that’s conscious of <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>In America, Europe and Australia beginning with universities and church-groups, the idea that you need to take action to stop behavior that goes against your values is becoming mainstream, and that’s helping to popularize divestment. In other words, in order to solve <mark>climate change</mark>, we have to think of lending and investment in fossil-fuel businesses, which are the major cause of the problem, as major threats to our future. This isn’t just about <mark>climate change</mark>, but I think we need financial institutions to adopt policies of not investing in military technologies like nuclear weapons, or in things like tobacco. If those kinds of demands are coming from the public, businesses will have to start providing services that meet those needs.</P><P><B>Shin: </B>In California,  public servants who are part of the pension program there have been making strong demands about how their money is being invested. I think it’s important for people to express their opinions not just as ordinary citizens but as employees as well. In Britain as well, the pension fund for employees of the Ministry of Environment has divested, in response to demand from its members. The European Union Parliament even passed a resolution that pension funds for 20+ member states have to take measures to tackle global warming. It’s precisely because there are movements among the general public that action is being taken on the legislative level. This kind of consciousness is already a part of the mainstream. We need these kinds of movements in Japan as well.</P><P><B>Marie: </B>There are a lot of organizations that do outreach work with investors and businesses, but you get the impression that there are not so many groups focused on educating the general public. That’s why I see our role as being to deliver the message to business that issues like <mark>climate change</mark> are something that “the general public cares deeply about.”</P><P><SPAN style=""font-size: large;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400; color: #434343; line-height: 200%;""> </SPAN></SPAN><B>Ian: </B>Yeah, our activism is something that’s more focused on the “individual.”It’s important to get across the message that, yes, there are things you can do. The fact that the project is, at its core, being run by volunteers, plays an important role in that.</P><P><B>Shin: </B>Conveying to businesses that “the public wants you to take this kind of action” is another role that 350 plays.</P><P><SPAN style=""font-size: large;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400; color: #434343; line-height: 200%;""> </SPAN></SPAN><B>Marie: </B>When I speak with Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) managers, they tell me that it makes their role in their companies easier even if they just have relatively small petitions to show the relevance of undertaking socially responsible business practices. When we organize demonstrations in front of banks or shareholders meetings, even if it doesn’t make the news, it creates a conversation within those companies. In that way, people’s action can be heard directly.</P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400; color: #434343; font-size: large; line-height: 200%;""> </SPAN><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline; font-size: large; color: #3db0df;""><SPAN style=""line-height: 200%;""><B>Q、What concrete goals do you want to achieve through this campaign?</B></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><B>Ian: </B>With these events, volunteers are going to be taking the lead in organizing them, which is a first for us, as well as something I don’t think you see that often in Japan generally. I think this proves that the seed has been planted for people that if they want to take action on something they can, and that they should be confident that they can change society. I hope that this removes some of the hurdles for people who want to get involved in activism.</P><P>Spreading activism isn’t something that just the three of us can do. An organization is really made of people. Even in businesses or in banks, at the end of the day, what changes of the behavior of people with the power to make decisions about divestment is other people. I think it would be good if we could help develop people who can do that, and so bring about a positive cycle of change.</P><P><SPAN style=""font-size: large;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400; color: #434343; line-height: 200%;""> </SPAN></SPAN><B>Shin: </B>In addition to that, this is actually the first time that individuals and organizations in Japan will publicly commit to divest. My hope is that this will contribute to other businesses and organizations that care about social and environmental issues taking action on the issue and create a conversation in the financial community about their responsibility to act on <mark>climate</mark>. If a lot of groups come together on this, I think the effect on society overall will be greater. I also want us to strengthen our cooperation with businesses that are active on a national scale.</P><P><B>Marie: </B>In 2018 I think there will be a lot of attention on the issue of coal. I hope that the hundred people we hope to get to take action on divestment will continue on and support us in the movement to stop coal-fired power generation.</P><P>Of course, advocating directly to businesses and governments is important. But it is banks after all that lend money to coal-fired power stations, so I hope that we can work together to stop the source of funding at the base of their operations. Because of that, I think activism that has deep roots in the community is important.</P><P><B>Shin: </B>Divestment is a type of activism that you can do anywhere, whether you’re in Tokyo or in regional areas. Right now there are plans to build new coal-fired power plants across Japan. One way that we can influence those companies is by pushing for divestment from companies that support new coal plants. Our goal is to create a new avenue for people to take action on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P><B>Marie: </B>The goal underpinning 350 is “to create a movement.”To take an example from overseas, a major environmental movement was born from plans to build a new coal mine near the Great Barrier Reef. If we want to create a social movement, I think it’s a good idea to adopt methods that have had results abroad.</P><P><B>Shin: </B>It’s often said that Japan is a great nation of “savers”. That means that Japan’s deposit holders have power. Precisely because of that, they have the ability to bring about change. You need capital to build a power-plant. At the moment there is a movement emerging to put control over electricity development in the hands of the people. I think we also need a similar movement to put control of capital in the hands of the people.</P><P>As part of the <A href=""http://mybankmyfuture.org/%E5%9C%B0%E7%90%83%E3%81%AB%E3%82%84%E3%81%95%E3%81%97%E3%81%84%E9%8A%80%E8%A1%8C%E3%81%95%E3%81%8C%E3%81%97/"">“My Bank My Future”</A> campaign we had 1000 people sign our petition. The estimated worth of their savings is around 3.3 billion yen (approx. 29.3 million USD). With that amount of money it you could build a small community power-plant. In Europe it’s becoming normal for power-plants to be owned by the general public. That’s something that at 350 we want to encourage.</P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400; color: #434343; font-size: large; line-height: 200%;""> </SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

									</SPAN></DIV></DIV></PERSONALIZATION-PLACEMENT></DIV><DIV class=""article article-first-row""><P>Though corporate green efforts have grown exponentially in the last decade, most initiatives fall woefully short of what’s necessary to meet the enormous sustainability challenges we face — from <mark>climate change</mark> to water shortages to poverty and social equity.</P><P><STRONG>That’s why it’s so refreshing to see one large company, Sony, set a goal of zero environmental footprint</STRONG> by 2050. The company has dubbed this mission its <A href=""http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/"">“Road to Zero.”</A></P><P>Before diving into how Sony has approached its target-setting exercise, here’s a quick review of why “zero” is an idea whose time has come: In a resource and <mark>carbon</mark>-constrained world, the best scientists tell us, we need to cut emissions of greenhouse gases by 80% by mid-century (it’s no coincidence that Sony picked 2050). For other pressing issues, society, governments, and the cold realities of science will demand even more dramatic changes. The word “zero” — as in zero waste, zero net water use, zero toxicity, zero child labor, zero fatalities, and zero <mark>carbon</mark> — will by necessity become a core part of business strategy and operations. (One large consumer products company is in the process of setting sustainability targets, which it calls the “Eight Zeros.”)</P><P>Only one of the green-themed zeros has had broad appeal thus far in the business community — the quest to send no waste to landfills: “zero waste.” Subaru demonstrated it could be done in 2004 in its Lafayette, Indiana plant (saving millions of dollars in the process), and GM has recently <A href=""http://www.<mark>sustainable</mark>lifemedia.com/content/story/strategy/62_gm_plants_achieve_zero_waste_status"">achieved the goal at 62 plants</A> across the world. These are impressive feats, but we’ll need even greater <mark>innovation</mark> to get to the other zeros.</P><P>Yet outside of a few usual suspects, such as perennial sustainability leader Interface Flooring or Wal-Mart’s goal of using 100% renewable energy, there are nearly no companies (or countries for that matter) that have outlined a path to get to zero environmental footprint. </P><P>This spring, however, Sony made the leap. If you spend some time at the Sony site dedicated to the Road to Zero, you get the sense that executives have clearly thought this through. They seem to realize that a big goal, just hanging out there on its own, would be far too daunting, nebulous, and not very actionable. So The Road to Zero works, as I see it, because of two fundamental components. </P><P><STRONG>First, the company broke up the goal into pieces, separating the discussion into four “perspectives” and six “lifecycle” stages.</STRONG> Sony has phrased the perspectives as ongoing actions: </P><UL><LI>Curbing <mark>climate change</mark>,</LI><LI>Conserving resources (which covers material use, waste, recycling, and water),</LI><LI>Promoting biodiversity, and</LI><LI>Controlling chemical substances.</LI></UL><P>The perspectives hew closely to the biggest environmental challenges we face as a species: <mark>climate change</mark> and energy, water, biodiversity, and chemicals and toxics. So while I might nit-pick and suggest that “conserving resources” is a bit too broad to be actionable, it’s a good list.</P><P>The six lifecycle stages cover:</P><UL><LI>Research and development,</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE-CONTENT></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Like many other electronics manufacturers, <mark>Sony Corp </mark>is deeply involved with <mark>sustainable</mark> initiatives that will increase environmental stewardship and decrease <mark>climate change</mark> and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions. <mark>Sony Corp </mark>ranked in ninth place out of 15 spots on the Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics. It was rated on its practices and policies regarding <mark>climate</mark> impact reduction, <mark>sustainable</mark> practices, and production of green products. Here are just a few of the <A href=""http://cleantechies.com/wp-signup.php?new=cleantechies.wpengine.com"">sustainability</A> initiatives that <mark>Sony Corp </mark>has been doing to make the environment a much safer place for future generations. </P><P><STRONG>1 ) Efficient Energy Use at Japan <mark>Sony Corp </mark>Locations.</STRONG> At the Sony Chemical and Information Device Corporation in Japan, all employees are able to experience their own environmental contribution via an ongoing energy saving program known as Eco Attack 30. Through this program, all the hardware aspects of “installing highly efficient machinery and timers, as well as central surveillance and automatic control equipment has been complemented with a software aspect where all employees are able to monitor energy consumption in real time – ‘visualization,’ discover and improve unnecessary air conditioning, lighting usage and so forth through inspection patrol, and by encouraging awareness,” was put into practice.  </P><P><STRONG>2 ) Efficient Energy Use at China <mark>Sony Corp </mark>Locations. </STRONG> A number of Sony plants throughout China are implementing a large number of various measures based on current energy saving assessments. A number of these locations have introduced technologies such as solar panel streetlamps and solar water heaters to reduce energy consumption. During 2010, a lot of effort was placed in energy efficient lighting, better insulation for buildings, and replacing older refrigerants with more energy efficient ones.</P><P><STRONG>3 ) Efficient Energy Use at Europe <mark>Sony Corp </mark>Locations.</STRONG> A number of <mark>Sony Corp </mark>locations in Europe have implemented a number of measures and continue to improve their energy efficient approach. For instance, in the United Kingdom, <mark>Sony Corp </mark>created a joint organization, which operates under the Environmental Management System, to allow local companies to fully comply with the requirements listed on the <mark>Carbon</mark> Reduction Commitments Energy Efficiency Scheme in the United Kingdom. Between the years 2008 and 2010, the CRC WG companies from <mark>Sony Corp </mark>in the United Kingdom, achieved over nine percent in energy savings. </P><P><STRONG>4 ) Efficient Energy Use at North America <mark>Sony Corp </mark>Locations.</STRONG> In North America, Sony Electronics Inc. was worked with a local electric power utility company to install solar panels along the roofs of the parking lot at the headquarters located in San Diego, California. There are a number of other environmentally conscious features that enabled the building to receive LEED Gold Certification from the United States Green Building Council. Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. has been experimenting with LED lighting on movies like Angels and Demons and Quantum of Solace, as well as television game shows like Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! By 2009, all studio sound stages in the lot were retrofitted with energy efficient lights and motion detection software. </P><P><STRONG>5 ) Efficient Energy Use at Singapore and Malaysia <mark>Sony Corp </mark>Locations.</STRONG> In Singapore, Sony Electronics Pte. Ltd. implemented a number of key measures to increase lighting efficiency, including the installation of mirror reflectors in order to better diffuse the light. In Malaysia, the Sony EMCS Sdn BHd.’s Penang TEC has been able to improve their air handling unit and chiller system through a complete overhaul. With all the modifications, the Malaysian office has been able to reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions annually by 700 tons. </P><P><STRONG>6 ) Reducing Energy Consumption via <mark>Sony Corp </mark>Vehicles.</STRONG> In an effort to reduce the total amount of energy consumption by <mark>Sony Corp </mark>business vehicles, the company has been replacing a number of their existing vehicles with hybrid vehicles. For instance, March 31, 2011 in Japan, more than 50 percent of all business vehicles were environmentally conscious vehicles. Sony Electronics in the United States has created a four year plan to convert a majority of its corporate fleet of 600 vehicles to hybrid vehicles. By end of 2010, most of the vehicles were hybrids. </P><P><STRONG>7 ) Reducing Environmental Impact Regarding Logistics.</STRONG> <mark>Sony Corp </mark>is looking to decrease the <A href=""http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/csr_report/environment/logistics/index.html"" class=""external"" target=""_blank"">environmental impact of all products throughout the entire lifecycle</A>, from the amount to energy consumed making the product to how much cardboard and pallets are used to transport the finished product. When it comes to transportation, <mark>Sony Corp </mark>looks to decrease transportation weight by reducing the weight of their products without decreasing the quality of the product. This includes shrinking the packaging size, improving leading efficiency, and using environmentally friendly modes of transportation. </P><P><STRONG>8 ) Development and Utilization of Vegetable – Based Plastics.</STRONG> Plastics that are based in vegetables are a type of biomass – plant matter-based resources. These <A href=""http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/csr_report/environment/resources/products/index3.html"" class=""external"" target=""_blank"">vegetable-based plastics</A> are superior when compared to conventional plastic because this type reduces consumption of petroleum and contributes to the overall reduction of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions. At <mark>Sony Corp,</mark> there are continual efforts to promote, develop, and utilize vegetable-based plastics. <mark>Sony Corp </mark>has taken the lead of the pack with its adoption of these plastics in packaging materials. </P><P><STRONG>9 ) Promotion of Environmentally Conscious Packaging.</STRONG> <mark>Sony Corp </mark>has been able to boost the total quantity of products it is able to load on every container by <A href=""http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/csr_report/environment/resources/products/index4.html"" class=""external"" target=""_blank"">shrinking the size of their packaging</A>. Not only does this help <mark>Sony Corp </mark>reduce the volume of packaging materials utilized and associated costs, but it also aids in reducing the overall environmental impact associated with logistics. <mark>Sony Corp.</mark> is also taking strides in reducing the amount of petroleum based materials it uses in its packaging, instead opting to use recycled plastic and paper materials. </P><P><STRONG>10 ) Utilizing Recycled Plastics in Products.</STRONG> <mark>Sony Corp </mark>has been making an effort to minimize consumption of finite resources by making large strides in <A href=""http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/csr_report/environment/resources/products/index2.html"" class=""external"" target=""_blank"">utilizing recycled plastics for its products</A>. On average, <mark>Sony Corp </mark>utilized over 24,000 tons of recycled plastics per year on products, such as recording media, televisions, digital video cameras, audio products, and PCs. In February of 2011, <mark>Sony Corp </mark>developed Sony Recycled Plastic or SoRPlas for short. It utilized over 99 percent recycled materials and has fire-retardant properties. </P><P><EM>Article by Shawn Lesser, Co-founder &amp; Managing Partner of Atlanta-based <A href=""http://www.bigpathcapital.com"" class=""external"" target=""_blank"">Watershed Capital Group</A> – an investment bank assisting <mark>sustainable</mark> fund and companies raise capital, perform acquisitions, and in other strategic financial decisions.

	Today, the White House will announce additional commitments from <STRONG>73 companies</STRONG> from across the American economy who are joining the American Business Act on <mark>Climate</mark> Pledge. With this announcement, a total of <STRONG>154 companies</STRONG> will have signed the American Business Act on <mark>Climate</mark> Pledge to demonstrate their support for action on <mark>climate change</mark> and the conclusion of a <mark>climate change</mark> agreement in Paris that takes a strong step forward toward a low-<mark>carbon</mark>, <mark>sustainable</mark> future.  These 154 companies <STRONG>have operations in all 50 states</STRONG>, <STRONG>employ nearly 11 million people</STRONG>, represent more than <STRONG>$4.2 trillion in annual revenue</STRONG>, and have a <STRONG>combined market capitalization of over $7 trillion. </STRONG></P><P>
	By signing the American Business Act on <mark>Climate</mark> pledge, these companies are:</P><UL><LI>
		Voicing support for a strong Paris outcome. The pledge recognizes those countries that have already put forward <mark>climate</mark> targets, and voices support for a strong outcome in the Paris <mark>climate</mark> negotiations.</LI><LI>
		Demonstrating an ongoing commitment to <mark>climate</mark> action. As part of this initiative, each company is announcing significant pledges to reduce their emissions, increase low-<mark>carbon</mark> investments, deploy more clean energy, and take other actions to build more <mark>sustainable</mark> businesses and tackle <mark>climate change</mark>.</LI></UL><P>
	These pledges include ambitious, company-specific goals such as:</P><P class=""rteindent1"">
	o   Reducing emissions by as much as 50 percent,</P><P class=""rteindent1"">
	o   Reducing water usage by as much as 80 percent,</P><P class=""rteindent1"">
	o   Achieving zero waste-to-landfill,</P><P class=""rteindent1"">
	o   Purchasing 100 percent renewable energy, and</P><P class=""rteindent1"">
	o   Pursuing zero net deforestation in supply chains.</P><UL><LI>
		Setting an example for their peers. Today’s announcements builds on the launch of the American Business Act on <mark>Climate</mark> Pledge in July, and the second round of announcements in October.</LI></UL><P>
	The impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> are already being felt worldwide. Nineteen of the 20 hottest years on record occurred in the past two decades. Countries and communities around the world are already being affected by deeper, more persistent droughts, pounded by more severe weather, inundated by bigger storm surges, and imperiled by more frequent and dangerous wildfires. Rising temperatures can lead to more smog, longer allergy seasons, and an increased incidence of extreme-weather-related injuries, all of which imperil public health, particularly for vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, the sick, the poor, and some communities of color. No corner of the planet and no sector of the global economy will remain unaffected by <mark>climate change</mark> in the years ahead.</P><P>
	<mark>Climate change</mark> is a global challenge that demands a global response, and President Obama is committed to leading the fight. The President’s <mark>Climate</mark> Action Plan, when fully implemented, will cut nearly 6 billion tons of <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> through 2030, an amount equivalent to taking all the cars in the United States off the road for more than 4 years. The Clean Power Plan, the most significant domestic step any President has ever taken to combat <mark>climate change</mark>, will reduce emissions from the energy sector by 32% by 2030. And while the United States is leading on the international stage and the federal government is doing its part to combat <mark>climate change</mark>, hundreds of private companies, local governments, and foundations have stepped up to <A href=""/the-press-office/2014/09/18/fact-sheet-white-house-announces-executive-actions-and-commitments-acros"">increase energy efficiency</A>, <A href=""/the-press-office/2015/06/16/fact-sheet-obama-administration-announces-more-4-billion-private-sector"">boost low-<mark>carbon</mark> investing</A>, and <A href=""/the-press-office/2015/07/07/fact-sheet-administration-announces-new-initiative-increase-solar-access"">make solar energy more accessible</A> to low-income Americans.</P><P>
	The measures taken by the public and private sectors enabled President Obama to set an ambitious but achievable goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide by 26-28% by 2025 last November. And in the eleven months since, we’ve seen unprecedented global momentum in the fight against <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>
	To date, more than 180 countries representing nearly 95% of global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions have reported post-2020 <mark>climate</mark> policies to the United Nations. This includes the major economies like the U.S., China, the European Union and India and it includes a large number of smaller economies, developing nations, island states and tropical countries – some of whom are the most vulnerable to the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>
	As the world looks toward Paris, President Obama is committed to building on this momentum, with American leadership at all levels – the federal government, state and local governments and the private sector.</P><P class=""rtecenter"">

This eventually led to a revolution in the electronics industry because those devices were smaller and provided more electricity than other fuel cells.</P><P><mark>Sony Corpo</mark>ration was the first business to <STRONG>commercially</STRONG> develop the lithium-ion technology.</P><P>In 1991, Sony launched worldwide sales of lithium-ion batteries. They enabled the company to start producing small video cameras and other devices that soon became very popular. The same technology is still used today to power most personal devices.</P><P>Now, John Goodenough is 94-years-old. He continues working as an engineering professor at the University of Texas in Austin.</P><P>Goodenough <A class=""wsw__a"" href=""https://news.utexas.edu/2017/02/28/goodenough-introduces-new-battery-technology"" target=""_blank"">recently announced</A> what he believes is another major development in battery technology. He and his engineering team have produced the first-ever <STRONG>solid-state</STRONG> battery cells. He hopes this latest invention will shake up the electronics world.</P><P>Researchers say the new, solid-state batteries can hold more power, charge faster, and do not get as hot as ones currently in use. They have at least three times as much energy <STRONG>density</STRONG> as today’s lithium-ion batteries, notes Goodenough.</P><P>He said the main difference between the old and new technology is that the latest battery cells use parts made of glass, instead of liquid.</P><P>“I was trying to improve the lithium-ion battery that you use in your cell telephone that has several problems,” Goodenough said, explaining how he made the discovery.

								HP, one of the world's largest IT companies, has pledged to reduce the emissions from its own operations and the use of its products to 6 million tonnes (20%) below 2005 levels by 2010. 
Progress towards this goal, a commitment entered into in joining the World Wildlife Fund/WWF <mark>Climate</mark> Savers program, has been so significant that HP is now looking to define new goals. 
In energy terms, HP has now committed itself to reduce energy consumption by 15 percent in its operations from 2005 levels, while achieving a 25 % reduction in the energy used by its products and operations combined below 2005 levels by 2010.  Even with an increase in revenues, total energy use was down 19.2 % below 2005 levels by October 2007.
“WWF commends HP for its strong commitment to energy reductions—not only within its own operations, but in placing a strong emphasis on increasing energy efficiency in its products,” said Carter Roberts, WWF-US President and CEO. “HP’s bold actions should serve as a model for other technology companies seeking to transform the way they do business to help protect the planet.”
“HP has been an environmentally-sensitive company for decades; it’s simply part of our culture and DNA,” said Mark Hurd, Chairman and CEO, HP.  “We take a leadership role in <mark>climate change</mark> initiatives like WWF <mark>Climate</mark> Savers, and we will continue to seek innovative ways to reduce our <mark>carbon</mark> footprint.&quot;
HP’s announcement comes as companies from around the world gathered to discuss business strategies to reduce <mark>climate change</mark> at the <mark>Climate</mark> Savers Tokyo Summit. During the summit, HP said it will sign the Tokyo Declaration – a call to action and renewed commitment on global warming.
Between 1987 and 2007, HP recycled one billion pounds of its products, representing 900,000 tonnes of avoided greenhouse gas emissions, and it set a new goal to recover another one billion pounds by the end of 2010. 
HP made further progress in January 2008 when it announced a commitment to reduce the energy consumption of its volume desktop and notebook PC families by 25 percent by 2010, and today it is working to consolidate its 85 data centers worldwide into six data centers with high-efficiency servers and cooling technology. 
Beginning in 2006, HP embarked on a joint initiative with World Wildlife Fund-US to establish an absolute reduction target for greenhouse gas emissions from HP’s operating facilities worldwide, explore efficiency goals for products, educate and inspire others to adopt best practices for <mark>climate change</mark> initiatives and use HP technology in conservation efforts around the world by 2010. 
WWF’s <mark>Climate</mark> Savers was founded in 1999 and currently comprises 15 major international companies committed to reducing their total emissions by over 10 million tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide per year. 
In its first attendance at a WWF <mark>Climate</mark> Savers Conference - this year starting on 15 January hosted by <mark>Sony Corpo</mark>ration in Tokyo - HP is expected to join other leading global brands calling for more concerted action on <mark>climate change</mark>.</DIV></DIV><DIV class=""right-column"" style=""padding-top: 10px""><DIV class=""container col4 image aside""><DIV class=""image-caption""><DIV class=""container""><DIV class=""caption hover"">WWF points out that the over-exploitation of fossil fuels - such as coal, gas and oil - is putting the whole of humanity under threat from <mark>climate change</mark>.</DIV></DIV><DIV class=""meta""><SPAN class=""copyright"">© WWF / Mauri RAUTKARI</SPAN><A id=""imglink"" href=""//d2ouvy59p0dg6k.cloudfront.net/img/original/scr9130.jpg"" title=""WWF points out that the over-exploitation of fossil fuels - such as coal, gas and oil - is putting the whole of humanity under threat from <mark>climate change</mark>.&lt;br /&gt; © WWF / Mauri RAUTKARI"" class=""colorbox"" rel=""image-gallery""><SPAN style=""float: right; width: 42px; padding-left: 16px; background: no-repeat url(//d1diae5goewto1.cloudfront.net/_skins/pandaorg3/img/icon-enlarge.png);"">Enlarge</SPAN></A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Combined with tightly modulated temperature and humidity levels within the grow room, this system has already shown significant advantages over outdoor farms since coming online earlier this year: Produce waste has been cut from 50 percent of a harvest to just 10, productivity per square foot has increased 100 fold, and water usage has been slashed to just 1 percent of what a conventional farm would consume.      </P><DIV class=""js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic ""><DIV class=""ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile""><DIV class=""ad-mobile-inner""><P class=""ad-label proxima""><SMALL class=""proxima"">Advertisement</SMALL></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Shimamura's indoor farming company, Mirai, is currently working with GE to set up similar &quot;plant factories&quot; in both Hong Kong and Eastern Russia.

No more. Now it's the Sony Club, in the Sony building, 35 floors above the Sony Arcade. Now, at parties, sake flows from a barrel labeled &quot;Morita.&quot; Akio Morita, &quot;Mr. Sony,&quot; is the scion of fifteen generations of sake brewers.</P><P class=""paywall"">But this is no vintage '80s, tired scare-story of how Japan is buying up America. It is the untold story of how Sony is turning American faster than any of us are turning Japanese.</P><P class=""paywall"">Sony's International Executive Committee meets not in Tokyo but in New York. The official language of Sony is not Japanese but English. If more than one gaijin (non-Japanese) is present in a company meeting, the meeting is held in English.</P><P class=""paywall"">Since 1990, the US part of Sony has sold more goods than the Japanese part. And the gap has grown each succeeding year. Sony's assets in the United States last year topped US$14 billion, more than a third of its global assets. <mark>Sony Corpo</mark>ration of America, formed last year in a reorganization that put all US operations under one roof, employs more than 30,000 people, two-thirds of them in the US. It exports over half a billion dollars worth of products from the US per year – nearly a third of everything it builds.</P><P class=""paywall"">If <mark>Sony Corpo</mark>ration of America were a separate company, it would rank 58th in the Fortune 500. Its chair, Mickey Schulhof, is American, as are most of the executives of the subsidiaries under him – except for Olaf Olafsson, the 31-year-old Icelandic novelist who heads Sony Electronic Publishing.</P><P class=""paywall"">Sony has been manufacturing in the US since it opened a Trinitron plant in San Diego in 1972 – and by now many of the televisions that come out of its American plants are completely made in America. Of the 10,000 employees of Sony Engineering and Manufacturing of America (SEMA), only 170 are Japanese, and their numbers are shrinking, not growing.</P><P class=""paywall"">&quot;They ought to just re-register the corporation in Delaware,&quot; says Chuck Goto, an analyst with S.G. Warburg in Tokyo. &quot;There would be a lot of advantages.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">But this shift away from Japan is not really new. &quot;Sony&quot; doesn't mean anything in Japanese. The name was picked for its look in Roman letters, for the Latin sonus (or sound), and for the resonance with the happy English words &quot;sunny&quot; and &quot;sonny boy.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">Sony wants to bridge the gap between hardware and software, to become the first global company that builds both the boxes and what comes out of them. It is this desire that is shifting Sony's center of gravity away from Japan. As another Sony executive put it, &quot;The US is where the future of the company unfolds.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall""><STRONG>Change is the Constant</STRONG></P><P class=""paywall"">Sony is moving more and more into businesses that are quintessentially American. In Los Angeles, the gaudy, modern slot-machine-style building of steel, glass, and marble that was the MGM Plaza is now the Sony Plaza. If you stroll across the street you'll enter the gates of what was the MGM Studio and the Culver Studios – now the Sony lot. You'll see Columbia Pictures (a Sony property), a Loew's Theater (another Sony property), as well as 24 sound stages to TriStar Pictures (yet another). The place never looked better: the buildings that manage to combine Southern colonial with chrome-and-glass Art Deco; the buff, powerful magnolias that somehow never seem to drop a leaf; the manicured lawns; the streets between the sound stages tarted up with false fronts and shops like a Disney movie theme park; all looking less gritty and more Hollywood-as-we-imagine-it than it ever did under its original owners.</P><P class=""paywall"">And in San Jose, California, amid the vast empty spaces and orange groves north of downtown rises an enormous new building: Sony's new high-tech research center, with its four-story atrium as long as a football field. All glass in front, all white inside, all Sony gray slate flooring, it is as large as an airport terminal, unpeopled but for two receptionists, the galleries above and beyond them brimming with the engineers and programmers of Sony's rapidly growing presence in Silicon Valley.</P><P class=""paywall"">The executives of Sony of America express a surprising independence from Tokyo: Although he is Japanese, Kunitake Ando, president of SEMA, considers it part of his mission &quot;to make SEMA autonomous,&quot; and describes Sony units in Southeast Asia as &quot;our competition.&quot; He says, &quot;I'm not the typical salariman, I'm not afraid to fight Tokyo. It's a question of who makes the decisions. If you expect to win here, you have to make decisions here, not in Tokyo.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">In the colonnaded Saturday-lunch quiet of the dining room of New York's St. Regis hotel, Kuni Ando suddenly pops a line from the musical New York! New York! into the conversation: &quot;If you can make it here, you'll make it anywhere.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall""><STRONG>Vectors of Change</STRONG></P><P class=""paywall"">The reasons for Sony's shift to America are many.</P><P class=""paywall"">* It's pushed from the center: For Sony, the shift outwards – and to the US – is not a change in direction but the culmination of an effort played out over five decades. President and CEO Norio Ohga has told Sony's global executives, &quot;Don't think of what Tokyo says as the golden flag&quot; (the battle flag of the shogun that all must follow).</P><P class=""paywall"">* It's pulled from the edges: American Sony executives build their empires by pulling work and decisions here, into the world's largest single economy.</P><P class=""paywall"">* It's forced by shifts in the yen: As the yen buys fewer dollars, it makes sense to shift as much work as possible to the biggest market and pay for it in dollars.</P><P class=""paywall"">* It's propelled by shifts in labor costs and skills: Americans used to complain about competing with &quot;cheap Japanese labor,&quot; but by the '80s the cost of Japanese labor equaled that of American labor. In the last few years, with the rise of the yen and America's ferocious competition on quality, American labor has become cheaper than Japanese labor in high-tech industries – as have American parts. And America has what Pradip Banerjee, a manager at the San Jose chip design center, calls &quot;the talented people that we need to attract.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">* It's driven by trends in markets: In the last two years especially, the American economy has recovered. While 1993 was a record year for the entertainment hardware business in the US, the Japanese and European economies have continued to wallow in recession. This year, the German economy is expected to grow by 0.6 percent, the Japanese by 0.9 percent, and the US economy by 2.7 percent.</P><P class=""paywall"">And in some areas, the Japanese market is simply not as mature as the US market. It's hard to build the consumer end of the infobahn in a country where most homes aren't wired for cable.</P><P class=""paywall"">* It's powered by the changing shape of the hardware business: As hardware becomes more and more a commodity business, characterized by the swift spread and imitation of new technologies, Sony is forced to rely on things that cannot be imitated: its particular sense of design, its aesthetic decisions, its service abilities, and eventually its software – the music, movies and games. Technical and research decisions are not specific to a culture or bound by geography, aesthetic decisions, and service capabilities.</P><P class=""paywall"">Corporate power follows the work. &quot;If you really want to build it here,&quot; says Ando, &quot;you've got to design it here. If you design it here, you've got to have major decision-making power here. So this authority is shifting to the US.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">With that shift comes a certain independence. In fact, American Sony units have carried out many projects despite Tokyo's disapproval, including for instance the entire &quot;My First Sony&quot; line. Headquarters didn't see the point – who would buy electronics in brightly colored cases with big knobs?</P><P class=""paywall"">Tokyo also didn't see the point of the &quot;Vision&quot; project (an inexpensive teleconferencing box with a charge-coupled videocam, a microphone, and some special circuitry, made to fit atop your monitor). Ando says, &quot;We talked to them for over a year. They didn't get it. So our factory in San Diego took it on.&quot; Within Sony, when Tokyo says no to something, it doesn't mean &quot;Don't do it.&quot; It means &quot;We won't give you the budget for it.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">Tim Agnew, an executive at Sony's display systems group in San Diego, says, &quot;The 'Vision' idea was a bit of a struggle, and there was some tension, but they didn't stop us.&quot; Brian Frohilich, of the same group, says, &quot;All I really need from Tokyo are parts numbers. The rest I can scramble up here or somewhere else in Sony of America.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall""><STRONG>Sony Biz</STRONG></P><P class=""paywall"">Sony is in three main lines of business: consumer electronics (the Walkman, TVs, boomboxes), professional and business electronics (telephones and telecommunications, computer peripherals, semiconductors, broadcasting equipment, medical imaging, display systems, factory automation systems), and popular recorded entertainment (music and movies, movie theaters, CD- ROMs).</P><P class=""paywall"">The first two have been on Sony's worktable since the company's founding in 1946. The third business is new, in part because the first two have gotten more and more difficult. The traditional engine of Sony was (1) inventing new technologies, then (2) turning them into products, and (3) marketing the hell out of them. But the increasing speed of change itself is making that an ever-riskier formula. &quot;Fifteen years ago we had a two-year lead time over our competitors,&quot; says Schulhof. &quot;Today it's two months. That trend toward making a commodity of electronics was one of the motivations to get into the entertainment business. If you have Jack Nicholson or Barbra Streisand, nobody can copy that.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">For decades Japan has been king of electronics, especially consumer electronics. Ever since it introduced the first successful transistor radio in 1955, Sony has led much of that charge, with the first pocket-sized radio, the first AM-FM transistor radio, the first transistor television, the first home VCR, the charge-coupled device, the Walkman, the CD (with Philips), the MiniDisc, and other <mark>innovation</mark>s.</P><P class=""paywall"">Japan made the boxes. Americans, more than anyone else, made the boxes sing.</P><P class=""paywall"">Then, in the 1980s, Japan invaded Hollywood. In 1988 Sony bought CBS Records, and in 1989 it bought Columbia Pictures plus TriStar Pictures, Loew's Theaters, and a raft of smaller entertainment properties – and Wall Street and the entertainment industry snickered. What would a Japanese box-maker know about managing the mercurial, pyrotechnic, maddeningly personal, egomaniacal magic of Hollywood studios? Comics did takeoffs: Schwarzenegger learning to bow, Dolly Parton stuffed into a kimono. It couldn't work. Sony would hemorrhage money.</P><P class=""paywall"">At first it seemed they were right: The savvy locals were taking the foolish Japanese for a ride. The $3.4 billion purchase price nearly doubled with costly add-ons, including $200 million to steal new studio heads Peter Guber and Jon Peters from Warner Brothers, then a half-billion to settle the suit Warners slapped on Sony for stealing them, then another $100 million to spruce up the bedraggled Culver and MGM lots Sony wound up with in the settlement. Then Guber and Peters went to town: Charged by their Tokyo bosses with gaining market share, they did it the way it is done in Hollywood. Money flowed like sake.</P><P class=""paywall"">Then, as the global economy slowed in the early '90s, Sony's debt soared, and Tokyo began to put serious limits on the studio's spending. But they at least did what Tokyo had asked: They grew the studio by as much as 25 percent per year. There were disappointments on the way –Schwarzenegger's Last Action Hero, supposed to be the blockbuster of all time, lost the studio over $100 million in one quarter – and turmoil in the executive suites. In the spring of 1991, after only a little more than a year at the helm, Peters was eased out of the job into an exclusive production deal, leaving Guber solely in charge.</P><P class=""paywall"">Yet despite the wrong bets, Sony's studios, taken as a group, have led the US industry box office race for the past three years, with films such as Basic Instinct, A League of Their Own, and A Few Good Men (all of which made over $100 million in the US market alone). In the process they pumped the US market share of Sony's movie groups from under 14 percent to just under 20 percent, with revenues last year of $920 million.</P><P class=""paywall"">Something similar has happened in the music market: In 1993, Sony Music beat Time Warner music divisions out of the top market-share spot, gaining operating profits that have increased 235 percent since Sony bought the company.</P><P class=""paywall"">How much of this is actual profit – or a reasonable return on investment, especially considering the debt Sony racked up to buy the business – is another question, one on which experts disagree. &quot;They ain't making any money on the entertainment side,&quot; says Paine Webber analyst Chris Dixon. &quot;That makes it difficult for them to find the capital they need to integrate their products across all the systems they are in.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">A. Rama Krishna, of Alliance Capital Management in New York City, counters, &quot;As long as your profits cover your interest expense, there is no such thing as an optimal capital structure.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall""><STRONG>Syn City</STRONG></P><P class=""paywall"">But the &quot;S-word,&quot; the word that Sony has used for almost six years now to explain its entertainment spending spree, is not &quot;solvency&quot; but &quot;synergy.&quot; The parts are supposed to interact in ways that make them far more valuable together than apart.</P><P class=""paywall"">Sony executives point proudly to the ways that they are beginning to knit the pieces of the business together, using their broadcasting and electronics expertise in the business of producing films (see &quot;Hot Tech,&quot; page 96), shoving the films into the satellite pipeline, and showing them in theaters – and turning them into computer and set-top games. Starting with Bram Stoker's Dracula, Sony detailed crews to film game sequences side-by-side with the movie sequences – on the same sets, using the same actors or stunt doubles – for CD-ROMs. And some flow has gone the other way. When Sony Electronic Publishing debuted its new CD-ROM game, Ground Zero Texas, it immediately got calls from the Sony studios, wanting to nail down the film rights.</P><P class=""paywall"">Sony Electronic Publishing is another American growth story, a hardware- and-software group that produces Sony titles, produces other people's titles, and even does contract CD manufacturing for other people's productions. A business started from scratch, it makes half of all the CD- ROMs produced in the US. According to Olafsson, the division pressed its first in 1986, its millionth in 1990, its ten-millionth in 1992, and its fifty-millionth late last year – a steep curve. The curve will likely grow steeper if Sony succeeds with the 3DO-Nintendo-Sega-killer company it has recently founded in Japan to design and manufacture 32-bit, parallel- processing, CD-ROM-based set-top boxes.</P><P class=""paywall"">In the pursuit of the holy grail of hardware-software synergy, Sony has poured its money, talent, and attention into the United States at an increasing rate – and the push has not been limited to the entertainment businesses. Even the traditional Sony box-making businesses have gained an American flavor as they expand into product categories where much of the action is: software, the infobahn, and high-tech helpers for the industries in which America leads, including:</P><P class=""paywall"">* Computer-generated special effects, high-definition television (HDTV) post-production techniques, 3-D theater sound, point-and-click video editing, and multichannel digital uplink facilities for the movie, television, and cable industries.</P><P class=""paywall"">* Advanced image storage and retrieval for medical use.</P><P class=""paywall"">* Super-high-definition displays for air traffic control.</P><P class=""paywall"">* Cheap vidoeconferencing modules for home computers.</P><P class=""paywall"">&quot;In some areas,&quot; says SEMA president Ando, &quot;the US part of Sony is just plain better at it. The technical trends in the two countries are very different. The US is much more advanced, especially in telecommunications.&quot; With so much of its market here, Sony must move more of its work here because, Ando says, &quot;we must shorten the cycle time on our products.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">Though basic research, the kind that earned a Nobel Prize in physics for one Sony scientist, remains in Japan, applied research and development efforts in the US have multiplied like wild rabbits. Beginning with an advanced video group in Palo Alto in the late '70s, Sony has grown twenty research groups across the US. &quot;Eventually,&quot; says Ando, &quot;we will even be doing basic research here.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall""><STRONG>The Truly Global</STRONG></P><P class=""paywall"">This kind of center-and-edges dance has helped make Sony one of a handful of truly global companies. Most people's short list probably would include AT&amp;T, IBM, Xerox, Sony's rival Philips, perhaps Proctor and Gamble, Asea Brown Bowery, and Glaxo Pharmaceutical. No other Japanese company appears on the short list – not Matsushita, a far more conventional company, and certainly not the car companies, which manufacture and design overseas, but maintain rigid control from the center. &quot;Tell me how many American executives you have heard of at Matsushita or Toyota,&quot; Rama Krishna asks.</P><P class=""paywall"">All these shifts – toward the edges, toward a distributed structure, toward the US – have roots in Sony's own history. Every organization has a &quot;story,&quot; something between a culture and a soul, that powers everything it does. If we search for Sony's core, its story, we will find at least a part of it in the image of Morita stumbling off a Boeing Stratocruiser in New York City in 1953, in the land of the conqueror, eager to license the transistor from Western Electric. The seven-year-old company he had founded with Masaru Ibuka was then known as Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha. He was only 32, naive about international business, awed by the sheer size of the United States, but determined to make &quot;Totsuko&quot; a force in the world. On that first visit he walked Fifth Avenue, imagining a day when he could put a showroom there. Only seven years later he founded <mark>Sony Corpo</mark>ration of America, and in 1962 he moved his family to New York for two years to get the new corporation going.</P><P class=""paywall"">Morita recently suffered a stroke that, it appears, ended his working life, but the eager willingness he and Ibuka shared to move out into a world that the Japanese had traditionally avoided has become a part of the &quot;story&quot; that makes Sony atypical for a Japanese firm. Much more than American companies, Japanese companies tend to operate in lockstep, in yokonorabi. Philip Anderson of Dartmouth's Amos Tuck School of Business calls this quality &quot;absolutely characteristic&quot; of Japanese companies. &quot;If Sony tomorrow set up an R&amp;D operation in Zaire, the others would do it within six months.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">&quot;Sony is unusual,&quot; says Anderson, &quot;in that it has no ties to any of the keiretsu, the great industrial combines such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, or Sumitomo.&quot; This makes Sony &quot;the least Japanese of them all. The ties in the keiretsu [meaning, literally, systems connected] are all Japanese-to- Japanese, informal, and personal. It is hard for [those companies] to build a genuinely intimate relationship outside the keiretsu. It's a structural impediment to being anything other than a Japanese company with foreign outposts. Sony, on the other hand, is far more capable of forging those kinds of ties with non-Japanese.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">At the core of Sony lies a kind of desperation to be first to the market (think Walkman) with something that strikes fire. For other companies, being second is much more comfortable: If you're first, maybe you've got the wrong idea – maybe the others won't follow your lead.</P><P class=""paywall"">Within Japan, Sony is seen as somewhat disreputable, a little pushy, a little flashy, as, frankly, rather American. So even in Japan, Sony has long attracted the kind of people who are comfortable with the more open American style. As Ando points out, Sony people don't approach conflict in the closed, face-saving Japanese style: &quot;We have open arguments. It's very different from most Japanese companies.&quot; The company deals with outsiders in a similarly nontypical fashion. Jim Fiedler, president of Sony Dynamic Digital Sound, the Sony company that produces a new 3-D theater sound system, used to be vice president of MCA, owned by Matsushita. He says, &quot;I chose to come here, because Sony is open to ideas that were not necessarily invented here. Gaijin have an opportunity at Sony. That's not common in other Japanese companies. It wasn't that way at Matsushita.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">When one critic said that Sony was willing to be the guinea pig for new market ideas, Ibuka sent live guinea pigs to all the company's top officers. Sony's goal, according to Morita, is &quot;to make our products obsolete before somebody else does it for us.&quot; With each new idea (such as the CD, the 3.5-inch floppy, and the MiniDisc), it gathers partners much as President George Bush did before heading into Desert Storm. After hiring music-industry veteran Robert Sherwood to convince competing music companies that MiniDisc was a bandwagon worth jumping on, Sony sold 400,000 of them in the first year – twice the growth rate of CDs.</P><P class=""paywall""><STRONG>Sony Tarot</STRONG></P><P class=""paywall"">For all this, the future of Sony is not obvious. If its goal could be expressed in one word, it might not be keiretsu, &quot;systems connected,&quot; but commretsu, &quot;communications connected.&quot; That is, Sony wants to be the first communications conglomerate engaged in both ends of the information pipelines of the future, from silicon to Schwarzenegger. But because of the laggard Japanese economy, the rise of the yen, and its heavy debt, Sony's overall growth has slowed in recent years. Critics point to the $12 billion debt it has run up and claim that it will have to sell off the studio and music businesses to survive.</P><P class=""paywall"">&quot;We will see an exodus from Hollywood,&quot; says Makio Inui, of the Tokyo firm Kleinwort Benson. &quot;They will be desperately trying to get out.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">Others claim just as vehemently that, all things considered, they have done very well.</P><P class=""paywall"">&quot;Yes, they have a lot of debt,&quot; says Alliance Capital's Rama Krishna, &quot;but if they sell some of it they will get three times what they paid for it.... I would rather be a shareholder of Sony than any other company that has gone into Hollywood.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">Critics like Inui claim that these businesses never made much sense in the first place and never showed any of the vaunted &quot;synergy&quot; that Sony was looking for.</P><P class=""paywall"">&quot;The only possible reward for buying a studio is to dictate the next VCR format,&quot; says Inui. If that was the point, then the move seems hopelessly ill-conceived, given the myriad ways that movies and music will be delivered in the future.</P><P class=""paywall"">But this is an extremely narrow view of synergy. Something broader is going on here. &quot;Sony is a design company first,&quot; says Dixon. &quot;They have an extraordinary international brand that represents high quality and great design. The issue is how you take that design sensibility of quality and service and make it work in all these disparate parts of the company.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">A test of this synergy will come when Sony introduces it's competitor to 3DO, Sega, and Nintendo next year (see &quot;Hot Tech,&quot; page 96). The CD-ROM- based game box is &quot;incredible,&quot; according to an industry executive who has seen it. But it is yet another entrant in a crowded field, and it will challenge Sony's ability to draw together its expertise in hardware, software, distribution, and marketing.</P><P class=""paywall"">Roaming its factories and offices, talking to scores of executives, engineers, and workers, one gets the distinct impression that Sony seems to have absorbed its deeply different acquisitions and begun the long process of mind-melding the hardware engineers with the creative types in Hollywood. The synergy is palpable in an orientation toward technological advances, technical excellence, and presentation.</P><P class=""paywall"">Sony's deep draw toward its new businesses is likely to accelerate when and if it moves into the cable and telephone service business – as most observers expect it to. Schulhof has been meeting with potential partners, playing with the possibility of offering a telecommunications partner a minority share in Sony's music and film businesses. For Schulhof, the big question is &quot;Who can give us an alliance in electronic distribution with complementary strengths?&quot; He won't comment on the talks, but allows that the chiefs of every phone company in America have met with him. He is searching for a way to raise capital free of Tokyo's debt woes. But despite Sony's critics, he shows no sign of thinking that going Hollywood was a mistake and no willingness to get out of the movie and music businesses.</P><P class=""paywall"">&quot;They have lots of problems,&quot; says Dixon, &quot;dealing with a core consumer electronics business in a difficult environment on an overleveraged capital base with a somewhat confused strategic vision.&quot; But he adds, &quot;at the end of the day it comes down to brand.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">In 1990, a study by San Francisco-based corporate image specialists Landor Associates matched people's awareness of a brand with their esteem for it. Sony showed up second on the list, with Coca-Cola, Mercedes, Kodak, and Disney among the top five. If that unity shows through in its new American ventures, Sony's commretsu could become a reality within a decade.</P><P class=""paywall"">Hot Tech: What's Hot From SonyHDTV: On the Sony Pictures Studios lot in Culver City, a simple nature scene - eagles, a canyon - runs three times on a screen the size you'd see in a multiplex. The first one is clearly video: the flat colors, the lack of detail. But the last two - one a traditional 35 mm film, the other high- definition video - are indistinguishable. Sony's HDTV unit does myriad post-production tasks for Hollywood, changing the film to video for editing, then turning it back to film. Last Halloween the same unit heralded a possible coming era of filmless film distribution when it beamed Dracula from Culver City to a theater in Burbank.</P><P class=""paywall""><STRONG>Special Effects:</STRONG> At Sony Pictures Imageworks at the studios, the monitor shows a bit of In the Line of Fire – a news clip in which a young Clint Eastwood walks between Jack and Jackie Kennedy. How'd they do that? &quot;We took a still of Clint from an early-'70s movie,&quot; explains Imageworks executive producer Bill Birrell.</P><P class=""paywall"">&quot;He was bruised, had a couple-day-old beard, longish hair, a wide-lapeled '70s suit, and a wide tie. We digitized the picture, got rid of the bruise, gave him a haircut, a shave.&quot; Similar magic can erase unwanted passersby from crowd shots.</P><P class=""paywall""><STRONG>Cheap Videoconferencing:</STRONG> The monitor in the corner of the conference room in the San Diego plant has something a little odd sitting on top: a flat bezel, the same color and design as the monitor, with a tiny video eye and a few microphone holes. Sony already makes US$100,000 videoconferencing units and $30,000 roll-around versions. But when Sony's T.C. Brown saw people duct-taping HandyCams to the sides of their monitors, he knew there was a market for something inexpensive. This unit will cost about $1,000 and will be followed by monitors with the capability built in.</P><P class=""paywall""><STRONG>GUI Video:</STRONG>&quot;Want to make the bear growl? Okay, we'll drag that growl down here. Now we'll put in a fade.&quot; With the ease of word processing, a Sony engineer in San Jose, California, is editing a video clip by the click-and-drag method, all on one screen. It's Destiny, Sony's newest GUI desktop production video editing system, designed to be cheap and fast at mixing live feeds with images from disk and tape for &quot;the ubiquitous electronic newsroom.&quot; What's cheap? About US$27,000. Cheap for a TV station.</P><P class=""paywall""><STRONG>Uplink Jukebox:</STRONG> Across the street from Sony Pictures Studios sits the prototype of a huge uplink facility Sony has built for Hughes' DirecTV digital satellite broadcasting venture in Castle Rock, Colorado. It's a massive computer-controlled jukebox that will feed all of the bird's potential 180 channels from one ground station under a single control. The robot arrays with their ranks of broadcast videotapes look like an industrial-strength version of cafeteria vending machines, but they are a vast improvement over &quot;sneakernet,&quot; the usual practice of hand-carrying the tapes to the machines for broadcast.</P><P class=""paywall""><STRONG>Theater Sound:</STRONG> In a Sony Pictures screening room, there's Clint again, in a very quiet scene. When he walks, the scuff of his heels follows him across the screen – and actually off the screen – in uncanny realism. In a scene from Last Action Hero, Schwarzenegger's boots hammer on car tops, guns fire, sirens wail, helicopters whir overhead, broken glass crunches underfoot – each sound in the aural collage ringing separate and crisp. It's SDDS, Sony Dynamic Digital Sound, Sony's eight-channel entry into the next-generation surround-sound sweepstakes.</P><P class=""paywall""><STRONG>Sony Plaza:</STRONG> On a Saturday before Christmas, on the ground floor and in the basement of the Sony offices building on Madison Avenue, crowds of people play with an acre or so of Sony HandyCams, VCRs, wide-screen TVs, CD-ROMs, MiniDiscs, My First Sonys, and Walkmen set up in racks, in bedrooms, living rooms, even in a car hung on one wall – its little built- in video screen rises out of the shift console. People say things like: &quot;Ooh, $400? That's worth it!&quot;&quot;Yeah, 27 inches is a good size for the bedroom.&quot;&quot;Harry, you ought to put one of these total entertainment theaters in the basement.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall""><STRONG>Game Box:</STRONG> By press time, Sony was showing a 400-MIPS (yup, 400) game box to select analysts. This monster is Sony's long-awaited competitor in the CD-ROM-based game world, and it has Mario and Sonic more than a little rattled. Sony plans to release the product in the US in 1995. One industry executive who has seen it calls it &quot;the hottest game box I've ever seen.&quot; No word yet on peripherals or software compatibility with NES, Sega, 3D0, or Atari software. However, Sony lacks infrastructure for developer support, compared with Sega's and Nintendo's well-oiled machines.</P><P class=""paywall""><STRONG>Luxury Labs:</STRONG> Sony several years ago set up the Research Center in Tokyo under the direction of Dr. Toshitada Doi. The Sony facility is famous among those in the Japanese research community for its size and the lavish fittings in the offices. Twenty research fellows and their support staffs work on building the future. Two areas of concentration: ubiquitous computing and speech-based computing with computer-generated interface that mimics the human face. What they are building now, the buzz in Japan goes, we will be buying in five years. Remember Apple's &quot;knowledge navigator&quot; video? At Sony's luxury labs, it's passe.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The <A href=""https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/doomsday-seed-vault/"">“doomsday seed vault,”</A> as it’s colloquially known, was built a decade ago to outlast nuclear war, global warming, and whatever other manmade disasters might beset our species.</P><P>But <mark>climate change</mark> has proven to be predictably problematic and the <A href=""https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/seed-vault-flood-forces-redesign/"">Svalbard Global Seed Vault may be less fortified than once thought</A>.</P><P>Now, <A href=""https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/the-government-proposes-to-allocate-100-million-nok-to-upgrade-the-svalbard-global-seed-vault/id2590668/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the Norwegian government has proposed a plan</A> to invest 100 million Norwegian Crowns (about $12.7 million) to upgrade the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. The proposed plan includes construction of a new concrete access tunnel and a service building to protect emergency power and refrigeration units.</P><P>“The upgrades, which we hope to begin presently, will ensure that the Svalbard Global Seed Vault can continue to offer the world’s gene banks a secure storage space in the future. It is a great and important task to safeguard all the genetic material that is crucial to global food security,” Jon Georg Dale, Norway’s Minister of Agriculture and Food, said in a statement.</P><P>Millions of seed samples from <A href=""http://time.com/doomsday-vault/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">more than 930,000 crops</A> take refuge within the seed vault’s steel and concrete walls, some 800 miles south of the North Pole. If (or when) environmental catastrophe strikes a given region, governments can attempt to reboot their agricultural industries by requesting seed samples from the three organizations managing the seed vault: the Norwegian government, <A href=""https://www.croptrust.org/our-work/svalbard-global-seed-vault/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Crop Trust</A>, and the Nordic Genetic Resource Center.</P><P>The hope is that the wide variety of seeds represented within the vault can be used to establish crops with the genetic flexibility and resiliency to grow in various environmental conditions. And it didn’t take long for the vault to answer that call. The first seeds request came from the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA) in 2015, to establish new collections compromised by the Syrian war. Last year, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault received seeds back from this withdrawal.</P><P>“In 2017 the important role of the seed vault was made evident,” Dale said. “For the first time seeds were redeposited at the seed vault on Svalbard. The ICARDA International Research Center, previously operating out of Aleppo in Syria, returned seeds harvested after they had retrieved their seeds from Svalbard in 2015. This demonstrates that the seed vault is a worldwide insurance for food supply for future generations.”</P><DIV class=""m-editors-rec""><H3>Editors' Recommendations</H3></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Operating profit rose 329.2 percent to 294.2 billion yen, its largest figure since fiscal 2007, according to Reuters. </P><P>  Losses in Sony's mobile communications business, which has been a cause for concern, narrowed to 61.4 billion yen from 217.6 billion in fiscal 2015. The Japanese firm has been on a drive to increase profitability with its Xperia smartphone range rather than chase market share, a move that appears to be paying off. </P><P>  &quot;If it means that we're selling less number of phones going out the door. We're fine with that so long as we have a profitable business, and we're really on our way to being profitable in that regard,&quot; Kazuo Hira, the chief executive of Sony, <A href=""/2016/02/22/sony-unveils-intelligent-devices-new-xperia-smartphones-mobile-world-congress.html"" target=""_blank"">told CNBC in February</A>.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""group-container last""><DIV class=""inline-player""><DIV class=""pro-video-chapters fall"" trkid=""3000495723""><DIV class=""handler"" style=""display:none;""><SPAN><SPAN class=""tag"">show chapters</SPAN></SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""player_1_103587247_1"" class=""asset  cnbcvideo imgasset desc_size600_400 featuredPromo""><A href=""/video/2016/02/22/sony-ceo-weve-addressed-issues-from-consumers.html"" data-videoid=""3000495723"" data-videotype="""" class="" headline-overlay"" data-nodeid=""103406225""><DIV class=""headline""><TIME> 4:10  AM ET Mon, 22 Feb 2016</TIME></DIV></A></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""group"" itemprop=""articleBody""><P>  Another bright spot for Sony is the gaming division which saw operating income rise 84.3 percent to 88.7 billion yen. In January, the company said that PS4 sales had <A href=""/2016/01/06/sony-playstation-4-sales-top-35-million-after-holiday-boost.html"" target=""_blank"">topped 35 million</A> and in its earnings release, it said an increase in software and hardware sales of the console helped offset the decrease in PlayStation 3 sales.   </P><P>  Its camera business also saw strong profitability which rose 72.7 percent.  </P><P>  Sony's strategy under Hirai has been to focus on its most profitable and high-margin businesses. So some concern will be raised by the 28.6 billion yen loss recorded in its semiconductor and component division, an area that has been key to the company's turnaround plans. The segment recorded an 89 billion yen operating profit in fiscal 2015. </P><P>  While Sony has managed to post some good numbers, the challenge will be maintaining the momentum, analysts said. </P><P>&quot;Sony Mobile has embarked on some aggressive cost reduction over the last 12 months. This has seen it exit markets such as China, India and the U.S. as well as reducing its headcount. Now the business unit has more stable financial position to build on as it looks to driving a return to growth,&quot; Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC by email. </P><P>&quot;This is a tough challenge in the brutally competitive smartphone market. It seems the starting point will be a focus on the Japanese market given it is now the biggest single contributor to Sony Mobile's revenue. Sony has also accepted that it can't rely on smartphones for future growth and is now pushing into the Internet of Things (IoT) area in the hope that it can drive new revenue streams. It will need to move quickly given progress already made by giant rivals such as Amazon and Google.&quot;</P><P>  The company said it was unable to give guidance for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 because of the earthquake that hit Japan earlier this month causing operations at Sony's main manufacturing site for image sensors and digital cameras to be halted. Activity at the factor is still offline. </P><P>  Sony said the impact of the earthquake on Sony's outlook will &quot;continue to be evaluated&quot; and it plans to issue a forecast in May 2016.  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

This reinforces a lesson learned from recent cyberattacks against Aramco and South Korean banks, specifically that theft of intellectual property for profit is not the only possible outcome of a hack. All three attacks involved malicious destruction rather than “just” theft.</P><DIV class=""media media-element-container media-full""><DIV id=""file-1261"" class=""file file-image file-image-png""><H2 class=""element-invisible"">amplify.png</H2></DIV></DIV><P>We should also take note that government authorities are not able to attribute responsibility for a hostile cyber-operation on a time scale that is satisfying to the public, and they may even change their minds in the course of an investigation. In the Sony case, it took several weeks—not hours, not days—for Washington to ascertain North Korea’s culpability. This does not mean that there is good reason to doubt the findings. Some of the public—including security experts who are unfamiliar with the ways of government—may insist that the only evidence that should count in government determinations is evidence that would be admissible in a court of law, and that the relevant standard should be “beyond a reasonable doubt.” Since the United States spends billions of dollars a year on obtaining information through classified sources, though, this stance is hardly persuasive.</P><P><STRONG>Deciding how to respond. </STRONG>There is not yet an agreed appropriate response to politically motivated cyberattacks. Part of the challenge in figuring out what to do next is that we don’t have a clear understanding of how old rules should be interpreted in light of new technology. So what might provide some direction? One easy guideline is that a cyberattack producing effects comparable to those a kinetic attack (one involving bullets and bombs) would have caused should be judged in the same way. That is, if a cyberattack against an electric power generation facility produced the same damage a cruise missile could cause, we should judge the cyberattack in the same way we would judge the cruise missile attack.</P><P>There are some kinds of damage, though, that can only be caused by cyber means. Incidents might include an electronic takedown of the stock market, which could have economic effects comparable to the financial crisis in 2007, or a foreign cyberattack on electronic voting machines that thwarts the will of the citizenry. Policy makers would be justified to regard such actions as acts of war.  If they did, they might choose to exercise the inherent right of self-defense that all nations have under the United Nations Charter—which could involve a kinetic military response.  (Of course, having the right to respond militarily does not necessarily mean that it would be wise to do so, a fact policy makers would surely consider.)</P><P>The Sony incident doesn’t qualify as an act of war. Sony Pictures Entertainment is an important company, but no one can seriously argue that the nation’s economy will collapse if it goes under. Still, some kind of response is necessary. On December 22, 2014 and again on December 23, the North Korean Internet was attacked severely enough to disconnect it from the rest of the Internet. If the US government was responsible (which it denies), the act would probably qualify as a good-faith attempt to respond in a way that is not itself an act of war. US responses, of course, may not yet be complete.</P><P><STRONG>Planning for the next one. </STRONG>Unfortunately, the US government does not seem prepared to deal with future cyberattacks. Getting its house in order will involve addressing at least two questions.</P><P>First, Washington needs to understand that its credibility isn’t what it used to be. Gone are the days of the Cuban missile crisis, during which US Secretary of State Dean Acheson offered to show French President Charles de Gaulle the photos of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, and de Gaulle replied, “the word of the president of the United States is good enough for me. Please tell him that France stands with America.&quot; With such trust having eroded, the US government needs to decide in advance what kinds of evidence it is willing to release to defend its attribution assessments. Washington often knows a lot more about the sources of cyberattacks than it lets on, but there is always a tension between releasing information to persuade a skeptical world and alerting an adversary about the methods intelligence agencies may have used to obtain it. It is up to national leaders to resolve that tension reasonably.</P><P>Second, the US government also needs to decide what thresholds it is willing to observe. If it calls the North Korean attack on Sony an unjustified act of war against the United States, is it willing to ignore similar attacks on foreign corporations that may hurt US interests? Deciding in advance will avoid time-consuming ad-hoc decision making when an attack occurs.</P><P>Companies also need to plan. How will they protect their most critical assets against cyber intrusions? Every boardroom should be contemplating the possibility that its company’s computer systems will be destroyed and private email, salary information, and much more publicly revealed. Executives need to decide what it’s worth to defend against these outcomes.</P><P>The most important lesson of the Sony affair to date is that we can be surprised. In October, 2014, few policy makers or business executives anticipated that a nation state might mount a direct destructive cyber assault on an individual corporation that was not part of the target country’s critical infrastructure. Cyberattacks can occur in entirely unexpected contexts, and the claim of “that would never happen” is not an adequate basis for either corporate or government policy planning.</P><P><EM>Editor's note: A <A href=""https://www.lawfareblog.com/2015/01/learning-from-the-attack-against-sony/"">longer version of this piece</A> appeared on the Lawfare Institute blog on January 23, 2015. </EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""right-column clearfix-mobile flex-column-mobile""><ASIDE class=""sidebars flex-column-mobile""><SECTION class=""region region-sidebar-second column sidebar""><DIV id=""block-bulletin-base-bulletin-newsletter-cta"" class=""block block-bulletin-base callout first odd""><H2 class=""block__title block-title""><SPAN>Receive Updates</SPAN></H2></DIV></SECTION></ASIDE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The Stoxx Europe 600 Oil and Gas index reversed gains after the announcement, sliding 0.3 percent as of 3:47 p.m. in London.</P><P>Built on the income that western Europe’s largest energy supplier has generated for more than 20 years, the fund’s investment decisions are guided by ethical rules encompassing human rights, some weapons production, the environment and tobacco. Norway’s fossil-fuel investments are coming under increasing scrutiny from a public that aims to be a <mark>climate</mark> leader without jeopardizing one of the world’s highest standards of living.</P><P>The fund has doubled in value over the past five years and was just given the go-ahead to boost its stock holdings to 70 percent of its portfolio from 60 percent to help drive returns.  The government, which also controls <A itemscope=""itemscope"" itemprop=""StoryLink"" href=""/quote/STL:NO"" title=""Company Overview"">Statoil ASA</A> and offshore oil and gas fields, was forced to withdrew cash from the fund for the first time last year to meet spending commitments after oil prices dropped.</P><H3>‘Good Time’</H3><P>Matsen said “now is a good time” for the proposal because otherwise the new 70 percent threshold will result in the fund buying even more oil and gas shares because it tracks indexes that include such stocks. The fund has a small amount of leeway to make individual investments and wants to keep oil and gas in its “investment universe,” he said.</P><P>The fund said it doesn’t expect returns or market risk to be affected “appreciably” by its proposal, emphasizing that cutting exposure to the energy industry would allow it to crank up investments in other sectors. Finance Minister Siv Jensen said the government will give the plan careful thought.</P><P>“This must be thoroughly assessed, I am not prepared to conclude in advance,” said Nikolai Astrup, leader of the finance committee representing the ruling Conservatives. “It’s important that the fund is managed in a way that’s predictable and long-term.”</P><P>But environmental groups praised the plan. “The world is changing fast, and it’s very risky to put too many eggs in the same basket,” said Marius Holm, the leader of the Zero Emission Resource Organisation. Sony Kapoor, a former adviser to Norway’s government, said the plan is “a belated victory for common sense over the powerful oil and gas lobby in Norway,” calling on the fund to now boosts its “green” investments at least tenfold.  </P><P>The recommendation also received backing from the Conservative-led government’s support parties, the Christian Democrats and Liberals. The Labor Party, the biggest opposition group, said it would like to study the proposal before making a decision.</P><P>“The government is responsible for the Norwegian economy as a whole and must take a broad and comprehensive approach to this issue,” Jensen said in a statement.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""touts-v2""><DIV class=""terminal-tout-v2""><SPAN class=""terminal-tout-v2__text"">Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.</SPAN><A href=""https://bloom.bg/dg-ws-core-bcom-a1"" class=""terminal-tout-v2__link"">LEARN MORE</A></DIV></DIV></SECTION><ASIDE class=""right-rail right-rail-v2""><DIV class=""sticky-container""><DIV class=""recirc-v2 rotation-item""><DIV class=""recirc-v2__title"">Most Read</DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

It's an unprecedented attack on <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topics/clean-energy"" target=""_blank"">clean energy</A> in Wyoming, and possibly the nation. And it comes at a time when such resources are becoming cheaper and increasingly in demand as the world seeks to transition to clean energy to prevent the worst impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P dir=""ltr"">The bill's nine sponsors, two state senators and seven representatives, largely come from Wyoming's top coal-producing counties and include <A href=""http://wyomingpublicmedia.org/post/four-steps-<mark>climate</mark>-change-denial"">some deniers of man-made <mark>climate change</mark></A>. They filed the bill on Tuesday, the first day of the state's 2017 legislative session. Activists and energy experts are alarmed by the measure, <SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-18f184d2-9812-15b2-f590-6c7b0d2f60c0"">which would levy steep fines on utilities that continue providing (or provide new) &quot;non-eligible&quot; clean energy for the state's electricity. But they are skeptical it will get enough support to become law.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr"">&quot;I haven't seen anything like this before,&quot; Shannon Anderson, director of the local organizing group <A href=""http://www.powderriverbasin.org/"">Powder River Basin Resource Council</A>, told Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News. &quot;This is essentially a reverse renewable energy standard.&quot;</P><P dir=""ltr"">Anderson, who has tracked the Wyoming legislature's work for a decade, added: &quot;I think there will be a lot of concerns about its workability and whether this is something the state needs to do... it seems to be 'talking-point' legislation at this point.&quot;</P><P dir=""ltr"">Last year, Republican Gov. Matt Mead <A href=""http://www.wyomingnews.com/news/gov-matt-mead-double-down-on-coal/article_afd826a2-ea69-11e5-a74a-6b20c465942e.html"">introduced a new energy plan</A> for the state that involved &quot;doubling down&quot; on <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/coal"" target=""_blank"">coal</A>. But even this fossil fuel-centric plan included room for the state's renewable resources, especially <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/wind-energy"" target=""_blank"">wind energy</A>, to grow.</P><P dir=""ltr"">The new bill mandates utilities to use &quot;eligible resources&quot; to meet 95 percent of the state's electricity needs in 2018 and then all of its power supply in 2019. Those sources are defined as coal, hydroelectric, natural gas, net metering sources (such as rooftop solar or backyard wind projects for homeowners and small business), nuclear and oil. Using power from utility-scale wind, solar and other renewable projects would be outlawed under this legislation.</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-853ccf26-984b-8a8d-1962-37ae4177b134"">Wyoming generates and consumes mostly coal-powered electricity. Nearly 90 percent of electricity generated in the state came from coal in September 2016, </SPAN><A href=""https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=WY#tabs-4"">the latest month with available data</A>. Renewables, mainly wind, were the second-biggest source; other small sources of electricity included petroleum- and natural gas-powered plants and hydroelectric power.</P><P dir=""ltr"">A big state with vast energy resources and a small population, Wyoming produces a lot more power than it needs: It  is the nation's largest producer of coal, fourth-largest natural gas producer and eighth-biggest crude oil producer, <A href=""https://www.eia.gov/state/rankings/#/series/48"">according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency</A>. Wyoming also ranks high in untapped wind resources, with one of the <A href=""http://www.powercompanyofwyoming.com/"">nation's largest wind farms</A> under construction. The wind power expected to be generated at this massive project, however, along with much of the wind power already being produced in the state, is already destined for out-of-state markets.</P><P dir=""ltr"">Under this new proposal, power providers could continue to generate and sell wind to customers outside of Wyoming without a penalty—but they would be hit with a fee for providing that same power to in-state residents and businesses. Utilities that fail to meet the proposed standards would face $10 penalty for each megawatt hour of energy the utility fails to procure from approved sources and the utility couldn't recover this penalty by raising customer rates.</P><P dir=""ltr"">Pacific Corp.'s <A href=""https://www.rockymountainpower.net/index.html"">Rocky Mountain Power</A> and Black Hills Corp.'s <A href=""https://www.blackhillsenergy.com/"">Black Hills Energy</A> are among the utilities operating in Wyoming that could feel the bill's impact because some of the electricity they provide to the state comes from clean energy sources now. Spokespeople from both companies told Inside<mark>Climate</mark> they are still reviewing the bill and wouldn't comment further.</P><P dir=""ltr"">When asked about the motivation for the bill and concerns about it driving away future wind generation, bill sponsor Republican <A href=""https://legisweb.state.wy.us/LegislatorSummary/LegDetail.aspx?LegID=541"">Rep. David Miller</A> from Fremont County said, &quot;Wyoming is a great wind state and we produce a lot of wind energy. We also produce a lot of conventional energy, many times our needs. The electricity generated by coal is amongst the least expensive in the country. We want Wyoming residences to benefit from this inexpensive electrical generation.&quot;</P><P dir=""ltr"">&quot;We do not want to be averaged into the other states that require a certain [percentage] of more expensive renewable energy,&quot; Miller wrote in an email to Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News.</P><P dir=""ltr"">(<SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-18f184d2-9817-1e24-8c22-8ddaa180c6fc"">In Wyoming, wind and natural gas are the cheapest forms of new energy generation, according to Dave Eskelsen, a spokesman for Rocky Mountain Power.</SPAN>)</P><P dir=""ltr"">Some of the bill's sponsors are also vocally opposed to <mark>climate</mark> action and continue to openly question the scientific consensus on <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/<mark>climate</mark>-change"" target=""_blank""><mark>climate change</mark></A>.</P><P dir=""ltr"">&quot;The controversy of <mark>climate change</mark> affects our families in Campbell County,&quot; writes state Rep.

Instead, it is hotly disputed by reputable and educated men and women....&quot;</P><P dir=""ltr"">Although Republicans outnumber Democrats 51-9 in the state House and 27-3 in its Senate, Miller, the sponsor, isn't confident the bill will pass. He estimates its chances are &quot;50 percent or less.&quot;</P><P dir=""ltr"">&quot;It's a clear statement the legislature is supporting the traditional sectors of the economy,&quot; said <A href=""http://www.uwyo.edu/cee/faculty/godby.html"">Robert Godby</A>, director of University of Wyoming's Center for Energy Economics and Public Policy. Regardless of whether this bill passes, he added, &quot;the fact that it has been run up the flagpole might have some negative consequences.&quot; For example, wind developers may be less interested in operating in the state.</P><P dir=""ltr"">Another <A href=""http://trib.com/business/energy/the-growing-battle-between-wyoming-lawmakers-and-the-largest-wind/article_315d1abc-6489-53b1-8d8d-faa2fe7d15ef.html"">recently proposed state bill</A> seeks to increase the state's tax on wind generation, a move that could also potentially discourage future wind projects as well.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""tagged-with""><LABEL>Published Under:</LABEL></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In the Arctic the thickness and extent of <A href=""http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/quickfacts/seaice.html"">summer sea ice</A> have decreased dramatically over the last 50 years, and computer modeling by NCAR scientists shows that the Arctic’s summer ice may virtually disappear by the middle of this century. Meanwhile, <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf"">snowfall over much of Antarctica is increasing</A>, a paradoxical sign of warming temperatures in this frozen, arid land.</P><P>The timing of the annual cycles of plant growth and animal migration has also shifted in response to <A href=""http://www3.epa.gov/<mark>climate</mark>change/impacts/ecosystems.html"">lengthening of the warm season</A> over much of the Northern Hemisphere.</P><P>And while the vast majority of <mark>climate</mark> scientists agree with the consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> that <A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf"">Earth will continue to warm along with increasing greenhouse gases</A>, the effects will be far more varied than a simple and uniform warming over the entire planet, because heating also alters the water cycle, among other changes. As a result, some regions will become considerably hotter or cooler, or wetter or drier, than others.</P><P><EM>Learn more:</EM></P><UL><LI><A href=""http://scied.ucar.edu/shortcontent/potential-consequences-<mark>climate</mark>-change""><EM>Potential consequences of <mark>climate change</mark></EM></A><EM> (UCAR Center for Science Education)</EM></LI></UL><P> </P><H2>How do <mark>climate</mark> models work?</H2><P>Scientists have understood the physics of the greenhouse effect—that some gases in the atmosphere trap heat—for more than a century. Because <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is one such gas, and because it is produced when fuels are burned, <A href=""http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Arrhenius/"">scientists in the late 1800s</A> were able to surmise that humans could one day burn enough fuels to cause the atmosphere to warm.</P><P>It is this basic understanding of <mark>climate</mark> physics that forms the core of today's <mark>climate</mark> models. These computer models use mathematical equations to describe the greenhouse effect, as well as how different parts of the Earth system interact. For example, some equations may describe how the surface temperatures of the oceans are linked to atmospheric circulation patterns.</P><DIV class=""mceTmpl"" style=""text-align: center;""><DIV class=""ucar_imgcaption_wrapper"" style=""text-align: center;""><DIV class=""ucar_imgcaption"" style=""width: 640px;""><DIV class=""ucar_imgcaptionTXT""><STRONG> </STRONG>The NCAR-based Community Earth System Model (<A href=""http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/"" target=""_blank"">CESM</A>) is one of the world’s most sophisticated models of global <mark>climate</mark>.
