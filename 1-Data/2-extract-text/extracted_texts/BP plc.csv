Of those, 33 percent were related to environmental matters and 7 percent were related to sustainability, according to the report.</P><SECTION class=""ad medium""><P class=""label"">Advertisement</P></SECTION><P>Stockholders submitted a record number of proposals about <mark>climate change</mark> last year, too, including a measure that <mark>BP PLC</mark>, Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Statoil ASA all supported that called for more transparency about the firms' <mark>climate change</mark> positions and improved <mark>carbon</mark> emissions disclosure (<A href=""http://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/stories/1060013659""><I><mark>Climate</mark>Wire</I></A>, Feb. 19, 2015).</P><P>Public companies are required to hold annual shareholder meetings, which typically take place between April and June. Company officials update investors there on plans and business strategies, and shareholders vote on resolutions, which may affect company practices and policies.</P><P>If shareholders meet basic requirements and prove with documentation that they own shares in a particular company, investors with a few thousand dollars in holdings can typically submit a resolution to the firm. Fellow stockholders will then have to vote on that proposal.</P><P>Companies almost always oppose outside suggestions and, occasionally, petition the Securities and Exchange Commission to block a resolution. That, in turn, prevents shareholders from ever voting on that proposal.</P><H3>Targeting oil and gas companies</H3><P>Mary Beth Gallagher, associate director of the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment in Montclair, N.J., has worked to file three separate resolutions this year at Chevron Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Southern Co., the utility. Each involved <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;There's so much momentum coming from Paris,&quot; Gallagher said. &quot;Now we just really want to know what companies are doing.&quot;</P><P>The <A href=""http://www.iccr.org/sites/default/files/resources_attachments/exxonresolution2016_final.pdf"">resolution</A> at Exxon urges the oil major to acknowledge the &quot;the moral imperative to limit warming to 2°C,&quot; the threshold at which scientists project crippling <mark>climate change</mark> will take hold. Exxon is working to block a vote on that policy. The company petitioned the SEC (<A href=""http://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/stories/1060031711/""><I><mark>Climate</mark>Wire</I></A>, Feb. 3).</P><ASIDE id=""image_asset_layout_11264"" class=""right span10 image_asset_layout""><P class=""caption"">A group of investor analysts found yesterday that 2016 has produced a record number of shareholder resolutions on <mark>climate change</mark>. As of mid-February, <mark>climate</mark>-related proposals accounted for 40 percent of all resolutions to company boards regarding the environment or social issues.  <SPAN class=""credit"">Graphic courtesy of As You Sow.</SPAN></P></ASIDE><P>Gallagher's measure facing Southern Co. follows the theme of the Paris accord, in which delegates of 195 nations agreed to peak <mark>carbon</mark> emissions &quot;as soon as possible,&quot; then scale back emissions sharply to hold global temperatures &quot;well below 2°C above pre-industrial&quot; levels.</P><P>&quot;They're taking a lot of steps to diversify their energy mix,&quot; Gallagher said of Southern. But, she added, it's important for investors to know the long-term plans of fossil fuel extraction and power companies. &quot;We want to understand their business strategy to remain competitive in a 2-degree world,&quot; she said.</P><P>Shareholders have presented Chevron Corp., Devon Energy Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Noble Energy Inc. and AES Corp., a multinational electric utility, with similar proposals.</P><P>Several pending resolutions ask company officials to explain how their firms would address the concept of &quot;stranded assets&quot; -- the idea that <mark>climate</mark> regulations, competing energy options or a combination will render coal, oil and gas reserves obsolete and financially foolish for companies to extract and market.</P><H3>Some major funds rejecting fossil fuels</H3><P>Investors have filed such measures with Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Hess Corp. Six proposals specify &quot;stranded asset&quot; or &quot;<mark>carbon</mark> bubble&quot; risks, said Michael Passoff, CEO of Proxy Impact, the group that published the report, and one of its authors.</P><P>Other resolutions ask for information about links between hydraulic fracturing and earthquakes in the United States, links between sustainability and executive compensation, board diversity, and the connections between corporate spending and lobbying against <mark>climate</mark> regulations.</P><P>&quot;The proxies affect the major issues of our time,&quot; said Andrew Behar, CEO of As You Sow, an environmental advocacy group.</P><P>About 25 percent of the proposals request that companies become more open about political spending -- including corporate lobbying, involvement with trade associations and firms' funding of political campaigns. Many of the authors behind those requests want to know how their stock investments are being used for political causes, often to lobby against <mark>climate</mark> regulations.</P><P>A few managers of some of the world's richest pension funds have grown wary of fossil fuel holdings, too.</P><P>The $900 billion sovereign wealth fund of Norway, a national pension, divested of coal last summer, citing financial risks. The California State Teachers' Retirement System, the second-largest pension fund in the United States, with $186 billion in assets, divested stocks of U.S. coal companies and pledged to &quot;initiate engagement&quot; with coal miners abroad to become more eco-friendly (<A href=""http://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/stories/1060031799/""><I><mark>Climate</mark>Wire</I></A>, Feb. 4).</P><P>In December, Thomas DiNapoli, the comptroller for the state of New York and the trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, one of the biggest pension funds worldwide with roughly $180 billion in assets, filed a proposal with Exxon, calling for an explanation by 2017 of how the energy giant would exist in a low-<mark>carbon</mark> world.</P><P>&quot;We need to know that companies like Exxon are prepared to meet this challenge and are taking steps to protect the long-term value of our investments,&quot; DiNapoli said in a statement Monday.</P><H3>Will the proxy crusade catch on?</H3><P>Scott Stringer, New York City's comptroller and custodian of $160 billion in city pension assets, has taken a more nuanced approach to addressing corporate <mark>climate</mark> policies: going after seats in the boardroom.</P><P>In 2014, Stringer filed 75 &quot;proxy proposals,&quot; which are designed to give shareholders the right to nominate candidates for corporate boards. He unveiled the effort, known as the Boardroom Accountability Project, to address three issues: board diversity, &quot;excessive&quot; CEO pay and <mark>climate change</mark>, each of which Stringer said he sees as long-term investment hazards.</P><P>Most boards of public firms hire the CEO to lead their company. Some investors have criticized this system, calling it insular, leveling charges of boys'-club favoritism and noting that CEOs often handpick their boards, creating conflicts of interest and rudderless leadership.</P><P>&quot;As long-term shareowners, it is essential that we have <mark>climate</mark>-competent directors at fossil fuel companies -- especially in light of the Paris Agreement reached last December,&quot; Stringer said by email.</P><P>&quot;Proxy access gives investors a real tool to engage boards more effectively, and hold them accountable if they are unwilling or ill-equipped to oversee the company's transition to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy,&quot; Stringer said. &quot;With more than 180 companies enacting proxy access over the past 16 months -- including most of the largest U.S. energy firms -- investors are now in a position to begin these critical conversations.&quot;</P><P>Stringer's office is targeting 20 fossil fuel companies with its proxy access method this year and executed a comparable strategy last year. Still, while large pension funds have more financial clout and can use their holdings to barter with firms to make changes, most companies oppose these proposals.</P><P>That reality makes Suncor Energy Inc., the integrated Canadian oil sands firm, an outlier this year. It supports a shareholder resolution to provide year-to-year reporting for investors about <mark>climate</mark> risks and how it will operate in a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy.</P><P>&quot;The conversation of this resolution started a year ago,&quot; said Jamie Bonham, manager of the extractive research and engagement unit at NEI Investments, a Canadian mutual fund company that manages about $4.5 billion in assets.</P><P>Suncor has openly understood and acknowledged <mark>climate</mark> science and publicly endorsed a price on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, so it isn't too surprising that Suncor is backing NEI's recommendation, Bonham said.</P><P>&quot;Since hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s are finite resources with an environmental impact, it will be critical to use them wisely as the world transitions to lower <mark>carbon</mark> sources of energy,&quot; Suncor said in a response to NEI. &quot;Suncor believes our energy system in an era of change.&quot;</P><P>A vote against the resolution, Bonham said, would signal that investors don't view <mark>climate change</mark> as a financial risk, &quot;which, to me, would be a giant red flag if they're managing my money.&quot;</P></SECTION></SECTION></ARTICLE></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

</FIGURE><P>SAN FRANCISCO — Lawyers for some of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, and attorneys representing two Bay Area cities are set to descend on San Francisco Wednesday for what’s expected to be a courtroom first: A daylong lesson on the latest science on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>U.S. District Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California is overseeing a public nuisance lawsuit that the cities of Oakland and San Francisco <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/403/12194/<mark>Climate</mark>-Change-Complaint.pdf"" target=""_blank"">filed last fall</A> against six fossil fuel giants: <mark>BP plc</mark>, Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips Co., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell plc. The two waterfront cities are seeking to hold the oil companies liable for the cost of infrastructure upgrades and remediation expected as they deal with effects of rising sea levels.</P><P>In much the same way the judge does in complex technology cases, Alsup has <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/403/documents/403/12194/2018.02.27-135-Notice-re-Tutorial.pdf"">asked the parties</A> for a tutorial. Alsup held a similar session on the laser science underpinning Waymo’s autonomous vehicle trade secret lawsuit against Uber Technologies Inc. and even asked the lawyers handling the litigation challenging the Trump administration’s rollback of the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals to bring him up to speed on the program.</P><P>In the global warming case, Alsup has asked both sides to “trace the history of scientific study of <mark>climate change</mark>” and fill him in on “the best science now available.” Since his initial order asking for the tutorial late last month, Alsup has proposed some <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/403/documents/403/12194/2018.02.27-135-Notice-re-Tutorial.pdf"" target=""_blank"">more specific questions</A>. For example: “Apart from <mark>CO2</mark>, what happens to the collective heat from tail pipe exhausts, engine radiators, and all other heat from combustion of fossil fuels? How, if at all, does this collective heat contribute to warming of the atmosphere?”</P><P>The oil companies’ lengthy line-up of defense counsel filed <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/403/documents/403/12194/AS-FILED-Motion-to-Dismiss-and-Memo-2018.03.20.pdf"" target=""_blank"">a motion to dismiss</A> on Tuesday on the eve of the hearing, which argues a lawsuit is the wrong venue to address global issues like <mark>climate change</mark>. They also argued the emission of greenhouse gasses at the root of the plaintiffs claims are the sort of issue Congress has delegated to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</P><P>“At bottom, plaintiffs are trying to regulate the nationwide—indeed, worldwide—activity of companies that play a key role in virtually every sector of the global economy by supplying the fuels that enable production and <mark>innovation</mark>, literally keep the lights and heat on, power nearly every form of transportation, and form the basic materials from which innumerable consumer, technological, and medical devices are fashioned,” the companies’ lawyers wrote. “The complaints contradict numerous federal statutes and raise myriad constitutional issues.”</P><P>Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, Susman Godfrey and Stern Kilcullen &amp; Rufolo represent Chevron, Arnold &amp; Porter Kaye Scholer represent BP, King &amp; Spalding represents ConocoPhillips, O’Melveny &amp; Myers and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison represent Exxon, and Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson represent Royal Dutch Shell.</P><P>Despite the forceful arguments in the motion to dismiss, the company’s aren’t expected to quibble with the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark> and its human causes.</P><P>Gibson Dunn’s Avi Garbow, who was the EPA’s general counsel during the Obama administration, said Chevron plans to point Alsup to conclusions from the 2013 “Fifth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>,” which formed the scientific underpinning for the Paris Agreement. That includes, Garbow said, the report’s conclusion that it is “extremely likely” human influence has been the dominant cause of warming since the middle of the 20th century. Garbow said that Chevron is ”neither going to understate or overstate” the degree of confidence scientists have on their conclusions about the earth’s changing <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>Matthew Pawa, one of the cities’ outside lawyers at Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, forwarded a request for comment to the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office. In an emailed statement, City Attorney Dennis Herrera said San Francisco looks forward to presenting the science and making its case.</P><P>“We’ll see whether Big Oil acknowledges the scientific consensus and its role in causing <mark>climate change</mark> or doubles down, once again, on deception,” Herrera said. “These companies knew their products were causing sea level rise, and they deceived people about it. Now, that bill has come due.”</P></DIV><BUTTON class=""load_more_shelf btn"">Load More </BUTTON><DIV id=""share-tools-btm"" class=""col-lg-12""><DIV id=""bottom-share"" class=""share-tools text-center""><BUTTON class=""btn tw""> share on twitter</BUTTON></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""author-bio"" id=""about_the_author""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12""><H2 class=""section-title"">Ross Todd</H2></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12""><P>Ross Todd is bureau chief of The Recorder in San Francisco.

In the past year, eight California cities and municipalities have filed lawsuits against major oil producers seeking damages for the companies’ contribution to <mark>climate change</mark> via their production of fossil fuels. In September of 2017, the cities of San Francisco and Oakland filed suit against BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Exxon Mobil, claiming damages and seeking an order of abatement under California’s Public Nuisance Law. Specifically, the cities assert that the production and consumption of fossil fuels is the primary cause of global warming, that the defendants were aware their fossil fuel product could have severe and catastrophic impacts on the global <mark>climate</mark>, and that the effects of the plaintiff’ actions will soon manifest themselves as a public nuisance in San Francisco and Oakland. Following these complaints, the cities are seeking an order of abatement that requires the oil companies to fund a <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation program that addresses the infrastructural needs of the cities to protect against the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> such as sea level rise.</P><P>Recently, however, the case has taken an interesting turn. In October of 2017, defendants removed the case to federal court and a recent order by California federal Judge William Alsup has confirmed that it will stay there. In his February order denying the plaintiffs’ move to remand, Judge Alsup asserted that <mark>climate change</mark> is a global issue and therefore should be governed by federal law. Judge Alsup goes on to provide his reasoning, concluding that “plaintiffs’ claims for public nuisance, though pled as state-law claims, depend on a global complex of geophysical cause and effect involving all nations of the planet. […] It demands to be governed by as universal a rule of apportioning responsibility as is available.”</P><P>Judge Alsup’s order went further, denying the plaintiffs’ claims that the case should remain in state court due to precedents set by the 2011 Supreme Court decision in <EM>American</EM><EM>Electric Power Co. Inc. v. Connecticut </EM>(564 U.S. 410 2011) and the Ninth Circuit’s 2012 ruling in <EM>Native Village of Kivalina et. al. </EM>v. <EM>ExxonMobil Corp. et. al. </EM>(4:08-cv-01138). While the plaintiffs allege these rulings affirm that the federal Clean Air Act displaces federal common law claims, Judge Alsup asserts that these ruling were concerned with greenhouse gas emitters rather than greenhouse gas producers, who are named in this case. This decision seems to signal a shift in the realm of tort litigation away from the state courts, as seen in <EM>American Electric Power</EM> and <EM>Native Village of Kivalina</EM>, and towards federal courts. The potential implications of this decision have many experts interested to see if it will be picked up by the Ninth Circuit or by the Supreme Court.</P><P>Furthermore, Judge Alsup went on to issue a separate notice inviting the parties to a two-part tutorial on the subject of <mark>climate change</mark>. The first part calls on the parties to trace the historical study of <mark>climate change</mark> covering topics such as smog, ozone, and global warming. The second part will “set forth the best science now available on global warming, glacier melt, sea rise, and coastal flooding.”</P><P>The California Environmental Attorneys at Bick Law LLP will continue to monitor the following cases as litigation continues: The People of the State of California, acting by and through Oakland City Attorney Barbara J. Parker v. <mark>BP PLC</mark> et al., case number 3:17-cv-06011, and The People of the State of California, acting by and through San Francisco City Attorney Dennis J. Herrera, v. <mark>BP PLC</mark> et al., case number 3:17-cv-06012.</P></DIV><DIV class=""more-links""><P>Share:</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

A new study attempts to do that, and says that more than a quarter of sea level rise and about half the warming from 1880 to 2010 can be traced back to just 90 corporations.</P><P>The study comes as energy companies confront lawsuits and shareholder resolutions seeking to account for their contributions to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The <A href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-017-1978-0"">new paper</A>, published last week in the journal <EM>Climatic Change, </EM>builds on <A href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-013-0986-y"">earlier research</A> finding that nearly two-thirds of historical greenhouse gas emissions came from the products and operations of just 90 companies—mostly fossil fuel producers, plus a few cement companies.</P><P>The researchers from the Union of Concerned Scientists and two universities took the reasoning another step and calculated how much of the actual change in the <mark>climate</mark> can be tied to those extra emissions.</P><P>Using models, they calculated that the greenhouse gas emissions of these 90 companies accounted for around 42 to 50 percent of the global temperature increase and about 26 to 32 percent of global sea level rise over the course of industrial history, from 1880 to 2010. Since 1980, a time when global warming was first getting wide attention, their emissions have accounted for around 28 to 35 percent of rising temperatures and around 11 to 14 percent of rising seas.</P><P>While some of the companies are huge—Chevron, Saudi Aramco, ExxonMobil, Gazprom—even the biggest of them weren't blamed for more than about 1 or 2 percent of the rising tides or temperatures.</P><P>The next step, one of the authors suggested, would be to calculate the damages from those changes—and decide if the companies should help pay for them.</P><P>&quot;We know <mark>climate</mark> impacts are worsening and they're becoming more costly. The question is who's responsible and who should pay the costs,&quot; said Brenda Ekwurzel, the lead author of the paper and director of <mark>climate</mark> science at the Union of Concerned Scientists. &quot;In the United States, taxpayers are footing the bill entirely. So maybe with numbers like this you can put in the mix the producers.&quot;</P><P>In July, three local governments in California <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/18072017/oil-gas-coal-companies-exxon-shell-sued-coastal-california-city-counties-sea-level-rise"">sued a group of oil and gas</A> companies, arguing that executives knew for decades that the &quot;greenhouse gas <mark>pollution</mark> from their fossil fuel products had a significant impact on the Earth's <mark>climate</mark> and sea levels.&quot;</P><P>The state attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts, meanwhile, are investigating whether Exxon misled investors about its risks from <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Exxon and Chevron did not respond to requests for comment for this article. The American Petroleum Institute declined to comment.</P><P>Ekwurzel said the paper is only a first step for trying to sort out who is responsible for what as the costs of <mark>climate change</mark> grow. &quot;We can calculate these numbers, and we don't expect them to directly equal responsibility,&quot; she said. &quot;That's really for juries, policymakers, civil society conversation going forward.&quot;</P><P>Generally, state efforts to cap greenhouse gas emissions, such as California's cap-and-trade system, hold companies accountable only for their direct emissions. But just because it's fossil fuel consumers like power plants and drivers who ultimately burn the coal, oil and gas that emit greenhouse gases, that doesn't let the producers off the hook, she added.</P><P>&quot;A common complaint is, what about utilities, what about car-driving,&quot; Ekwurzel said. &quot;The thing is, is it the activities or is it how we've chosen to power those activities? We know there are other ways to move through space or to turn on the lights that don't rely as much on fossil fuels.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""tagged-with""><LABEL>Published Under:</LABEL></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

BP has interests in China: [134] Both its oil and chemicals divisions operate in the country [135]. The company is keen to capture a slice of the growing Chinese energy market so to this end it has invested $580 million in Petrochina, China’s largest oil company, a subsidiary of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation. When Petrochina held an initial public offering in the United States in 2000, BP bought about 20 percent of the $3.1 billion stocks offered [136] and BP has invested a further $2.5 billion in joint ventures with the Chinese National petroleum Corporation [137]. Petrochina is accused of profiting from human rights abuses in Tibet and Sudan and is responsible for the building of the controversial Sebei-Langhou gas pipeline through eastern Tibet which will allow China to appropriate Tibet’s mineral wealth by pumping natural gas from the Sebei gas fields in the Tsaidam basin in northern Tibet to Lanzhou in Northwest China. The estimated cost of the pipeline is $580 million [138]. BP’s investment in Petrochina will provide some of the much needed capital for this project which campaigners claim will be used to rape the resources of a region China is accused of oppressing over its demands for autonomy from Beijing.</P><P>Pro-Tibet lobbyists and groups who promote ethical investment filed a shareholders’ resolution at BP’s annual general meeting in April 2001, calling on the firm to dispense with its 2.2 percent stake in PetroChina [139].</P><P><EM>“The directors of BP cannot pretend to be ignorant of the genocide . . . that their Chinese business partners and the Chinese government are engaged in both in Tibet and the Sudan”</EM>
Kevin Kearns, President of the United States Business and Industry Council [140].</P><P>In Sudan BP is accused of operating in areas where human rights groups have reported civilians being killed, bombed and ejected from their homes to permit oil production and the building of pipelines [141].</P><P>BP’s defence has been to state that it is not directly invested in the controversial projects [142] but BP and PetroChina signed a joint-venture deal in April 2001 to operate up to 500 petrol stations in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, China’s largest oil consuming province [143].</P><P>BP also leads a joint-venture consortium that includes Japan’s Mitsubishi, Itochu, Nissho Iwai and Malaysia’s Petronas, which is bidding to work with Petrochina on building the 4,200km (2,610 mile) west-east natural gas pipeline from the northwestern region of Xinjiang (Turkestan) to the eastern city of Shanghai. Since 1997, more than 270 Uyghurs (The indigenous Turkestai people) have been sentenced to death and killed for political reasons. Construction of the pipeline is scheduled to start in October 2001 and start providing gas to Shanghai in the second half of 2003 [144].</P><P><A href=""https://corporatewatch.org/company-profiles/bp-plc-corporate-crimes#top"" class=""broken_link"">Back to top</A></P><P><STRONG>Devastating Indigenous Peoples and Wildlife Habitats</STRONG>
In The US, BP is set to be one of the first companies to drill in ANWR (the arctic national wildlife refuge) in Alaska. The ANWR is a pristine 7.5 million hectare area, sometimes called ‘America’s Serengeti’ because of its biodiversity. If and when the Bush administration gives the go-ahead, of course all of the oil majors will want a slice of the ANWR pie but BP has existing operations in Alaska in Prudhoe bay, only 130km west of the refuge [145] and John Brown, BP group chief executive has stated that while BP will not make a decision on whether it wishes to drill in the area prior to any US government announcement about licensing, BP would be in a good position to take advantage of any exploration licences in the area since it is experienced in working responsibly within the fragile artic environment [146]. The reality is a little more controversial: oil exploration has already turned 2,600 square km of fragile tundra at Prudhoe bay into a sprawling industrial zone [147] and BP alone was responsible for 104 oil spills in the region between January 1997 and March 1998. [148] The local Gwich’in indigenous people are outraged at any possible plans to drill within the ANWR. They fear that drilling operations will decimate the caribou heard (one of the world’s largest) and threaten their ancient culture. Other species in the area which are likely to be affected by drilling include grizzlies and polar bears, ringed seals, wolves, musk-ox and 135 species of migratory birds.</P><P>The oil lobby are pushing hard in Washington to overturn the existing 20 year moratorium on drilling in the area and with president George W. Bush himself a former oil man (Bush Exploration/Arbusto was sold to spectrum 7 and later acquired by Harken energy) and Alaska’s republican senator Frank Murkowski supporting any attempt to open the ANWR to exploration, it looks likely that BP will soon be drilling in the area, despite the fact that the US geological survey estimates that total reserves within ANWR are unlikely to exceed six months worth of oil for the US at current consumption rates [149].</P><P>At BP’s AGM (April 19 2001) more than 7% of BP shareholders supported a resolution filed by the US Public Interest Research Group and a coalition of 131 environmental groups, investors and religious organisations calling on BP to make the transition away from fossil fuels and criticising the company’s stated desire to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The resolution, which received support from an unprecedented thirteen percent of shareholders at last year’s meeting, was rejected by BP on technical grounds. BP contended that US owners of American Depository Shares do not have the same rights to file shareholder resolutions as investors with ordinary shares in the United Kingdom. Athan Manuel director of PIRG remained determined, however. “We are going to keep pushing BP to stay out of the Arctic and go solar, year after year” he said [150].</P><P><A href=""https://corporatewatch.org/company-profiles/bp-plc-corporate-crimes#top"" class=""broken_link"">Back to top</A></P><P><STRONG>Fuelling Unrest In Troubled Areas</STRONG>
BP is the dominant company drilling in the southern Caspian Sea and leads the Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC) an international consortium of 11 oil companies who have yet to decide whether they will build the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline [151] which would be used to export Caspian Sea oil to Turkey and on to Europe and Israel. Shareholders could sanction construction work in the second half of 2002 and oil could come on line by the end of 2004.</P><P>The consortium hopes that the pipeline will be part funded by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, EBRD president Jean Lemierre said “Kazakhstan is a key country for the EBRD.” The EBRD has so far committed over 700 million Euros to 14 projects in Kazakhstan [152]. EBRD support is crucial since there have been persistent claims that the 2.7 billion dollar Baku-Ceyhan route would be unprofitable [153].</P><P>David Woodward, BP associate president in Azerbaijan, says the viability of the project has been strengthened by favourable agreements with Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, through which the pipeline will pass. Turkey’s hardline resistance to an increase in tanker traffic through the environmentally sensitive Bosporus will have been another factor in BP’s support for the pipeline [154].</P><P>Nevertheless, Baku-Ceyhan route is not definite and other options exist for the export of Caspian oil to world markets: The Baku-Novorossiysk pipeline has been completed but is out of operation since it passes through troubled Chechnya [155] and there have been additional disputes over Russian customs tarifs [156]. The Baku-Supsa pipeline has been built and is operating at full capacity but as with the Russian route, oil tankers leaving Supsa need to pass through the Bosporous Straits at Istanbul to reach Europe. A 4th option exists via Iran, the American government has been staunchly opposed to dealing with Iran but the companies involved have been more open-minded. It has been speculated that BP is interested in the deal, and since its merger with Amoco, has been pushing for its acceptance in the US.</P><P><A href=""https://corporatewatch.org/company-profiles/bp-plc-corporate-crimes#top"" class=""broken_link"">Back to top</A></P><P><STRONG>Colluding In Human Rights Violations</STRONG>
BP has been accused in the European Parliament of colluding in gross human rights violations by the Colombian army and of wanton environmental destruction in pursuit of profits. Evidence for the accusations comes from a report ordered by Colombia’s President Samper and compiled by a commission including the President’s human rights adviser, Attorney-General and Ombudsman. The unpublished report, completed in July 1995 made specific allegations that BP passed photographs and videos of local protesters to the army, which human rights groups say led to killings, disappearances, torture and beatings [157].</P><P>Environmental activist Humberto Castan~eda was jailed after being wrongly identified as a guerilla leader by BP security officer Steve Devine and Colombian soldiers are also alleged to have broken strikes by BP employees [158].</P><P>The same government report accused BP of causing serious damage to a protected forest, polluting a river, and damaging bridges as well as the only road available for locals to take their products to market [159].</P><P>BP stated that it had no choice but to pay a compulsory ‘war tax’ for army protection to stop left-wing guerillas kidnapping senior staff and attacking oil installations. But BP also made additional voluntary contributions to Colombian military spending which it claimed were to provide soldiers with good food and accommodation [160].</P><P>Oil exploration has led to horrific human rights violations against the people of Southern Sudan who, during the civil war which has racked Sudan for the past 40 years have been victims, many claim, of genocide. The China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) with which BP works closely, has a 40 percent share in oil production in Southern Sudan and has invested approximately 15 billion US dollars in oil extraction in the country [161].</P><P>Since 1998 China has been the largest supplier of weapons to the Sudanese Regime in Khartoum. In August 1999, a pipeline was put into service that runs from the oil fields around Bentiu and Heglig to Port Sudan. The war against the local populations of Southern Sudan has been fought with the goal of depopulating the oil regions. Innumerable people have already been killed and tens of thousands have fled or are fleeing because of the ‘burnt-earth politics’ practiced by the government [162].<STRONG>Corporate crimes are not confined to BP’s upstream operations</STRONG> In the United States BP work closely with McDonald’s, ever-present symbol of globalisation, and in Britain BP supply fuels to supermarket giants Safeway [163] who have built their superstores on Britain’s green space, encouraged traffic congestion through out-of-town shopping and depressed the prices paid to UK farmers.

<BODY><H1>Big Oil and the Demise of Crude <mark>Climate Change</mark> Denial</H1><P style=""text-align: justify;"">From 1989 to 2002, several large US companies, including the oil companies Exxon and the US subsidiaries of Shell and BP, sponsored a lobbying organisation called the <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_<mark>Climate</mark>_Coalition"">Global <mark>Climate</mark> Coalition</A> (GCC), to counter the strengthening <A href=""https://skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.htm"">consensus</A> that human <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions posed a serious threat to the Earth’s <mark>climate</mark>. As has been documented by <A href=""http://www.desmogblog.com/<mark>climate</mark>-cover-up"">Hoggan and Littlemore</A> and <A href=""http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/"">Oreskes and Conway</A>, the GCC and its fellow travellers took a leaf out of the tobacco industry’s playbook and attempted to counter the message of peer-reviewed science by deliberately sowing doubt through emphasizing uncertainties and unknowns. The <mark>climate</mark> scientist <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/science/earth/24deny.html?_r=0&amp;pagewanted=all"">Benjamin Santer accused the GCC</A> of deliberately suppressing scientific information that supported the IPCC consensus.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">In the late 1990s, the oil industry’s response to the <mark>climate</mark> question started to change, when BP and Shell decided to abandon the GCC and instead embrace the scientific consensus. According to the account by ex-BP geologist Bryan Lovell in his book <A href=""http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item2704220/?site_locale=en_GB""><EM>Challenged by <mark>Carbon</mark></EM></A>, BP’s change of mind was triggered by a memo sent in 1997, by then Chief Geologist David Jenkins, to the managing directors of the company that maintained that it was time for BP to be prepared to respond to the <mark>climate</mark> crisis in a constructive manner. Jenkins’ argument—which is detailed in Lovell’s book—was framed to appeal to BP’s corporate self-interest; pointing to future opportunities to employ the company’s subsurface expertise for <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration, and also to shift the <mark>climate</mark> mitigation focus away from the oil industry onto the coal-fired power sector. (Experienced corporate insiders know that appeals to ethics gain less traction than appeals to self-interest.) Jenkins’ recommendation was well received and over the following years the company changed its name to “<mark>BP plc</mark>”, changed to a new sunflower logo (<A href=""http://stocklogos.com/topic/famous-logo-designs-and-how-much-did-they-cost"">at a cost of $211 million</A>) and adopted the slogan “Beyond Petroleum”.  In 2002, the chief executive of BP, <A href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2006/11/its-not-easy-being-green"">Lord John Browne</A> gave a speech in which he said:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P style=""text-align: justify;""><EM>''<mark>Climate change</mark> is an issue which raises fundamental questions about the relationship between companies and society as a whole, and between one generation and the next.''</EM></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">and<EM> </EM></P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><EM>''Companies composed of highly skilled and trained people can't live in denial of mounting evidence gathered by hundreds of the most reputable scientists in the world.''</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Not every big oil company responded as deftly. <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_action_on_<mark>climate</mark>_change#ExxonMobil"">Exxon</A>, under the leadership of CEO Lee Raymond, remained a sponsor of several <mark>climate</mark>-change-skeptic organizations until the mid-2000s.

No longer. The National Oil Companies (NOCs) now control 55% of the world’s production, 88% of the reserves and the IOC’s today have full access to only 15% of the world’s reserves (see this <A href=""http://www.eia.gov/energy_in_brief/world_oil_market.cfm"">EIA report</A> for details). The “Big Oil” oligopoly is over.

The future reduction in demand would have to be achieved by some kind of <mark>carbon</mark> pricing, so that the high-<mark>carbon</mark>-emission oils such as the <A href=""https://skepticalscience.com/SW12.html"">Alberta oil sands</A> would be preferentially squeezed out as well. IOC’s today are increasingly focussing on high-operating cost, <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive oils marketed to industrialized nations. The world in 2050 will not be a big enough place to accommodate both a thriving oil industry and a stable <mark>climate</mark>.</P><H3 style=""text-align: justify;"">How did oil producers come to accept scientific reality so easily?</H3><P style=""text-align: justify;""><A href=""http://environment.yale.edu/<mark>climate</mark>/files/Extreme-Weather-Public-Opinion-September-2012.pdf"">Surveys</A> show that a significant fraction of the American public still rejects the scientific consensus on human-caused global warming, and that the issue is considered to be so divisive in the United States that it has <A href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2012/10/<mark>climate</mark>-change-the-debates-great-unmentionable.html#ixzz29f48gM00"">barely received a mention</A> in the 2012 Presidential elections.  On the basis of my own involvement in the <mark>climate</mark> debate, it seems fair to conclude that individuals who reject human-caused <mark>climate change</mark> tend to be stubborn in their beliefs and it is a rare occurrence when somebody admits that they have changed their minds due to the mounting evidence. In contrast, oil-producing corporations and countries seem to have embraced the scientific consensus quite readily, even though their current business models are incompatible with the emissions cutbacks that will be required for mitigation.  How can we explain that the big IOCs were able to change their minds, while many other <mark>climate</mark> “skeptics” remain obstinately impervious to persuasion?</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">I propose that the reason for this is because individuals tend to come by their beliefs through <A href=""https://skepticalscience.com/CCCMpersonal2.html"">intuitive, emotional responses</A> (<A href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/15bb6522-04ac-11e1-91d9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz29oGBudj4"">Daniel Kahneman</A>’s fast brain), which they then use their reason (slow brain) to justify after the fact. Furthermore, they then stick to these beliefs, partly as a matter of solidarity with their cultural group, <A href=""https://skepticalscience.com/Kahan.html"">regardless of how much more they learn about the science</A>. Countries and <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Corporation_(film)"">corporations</A>, on the other hand (paraphrasing <A href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle"">Charles de Gaulle</A>), don’t have friends or emotions; they only have interests. A corporation’s key interest in a competitive market is to maintain the confidence of its shareholders, customers and employees, a goal that the IOCs evidently—judging from Lord Browne’s speech quoted earlier—considered to be incompatible with a transparently self-serving tactical rejection of the consensus of scientific experts.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">And it’s not just hot air. Oil companies don’t just say that they accept <mark>climate change</mark>; they are acting as if it is really happening, especially with their plans to explore in the Arctic. For example, Shell’s <A href=""http://www.boem.gov/uploadedFiles/2011_1214_FINAL_2012ChukchiSeaEA.PDF"">Environmental Assessment</A> report for plans to drill in the Chuckchi Sea, Alaska, acknowledges the work of the IPCC and makes several references to the lengthening open water season in the Arctic Ocean. If any contrarian truly believes that the Arctic sea ice retreat that we have seen in recent years is part of a decadal cycle, then there is good money to be made shorting the stock of the oil companies who are making big bets on the sea ice disappearing for ever.</P><H3 style=""text-align: justify;"">A muddled verdict on Big Oil and <mark>climate change</mark></H3><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Even though big oil companies are, for the most part, no longer actively questioning the fundamentals of <mark>climate</mark> science, they are <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/14/us/politics/fossil-fuel-industry-opens-wallet-to-defeat-obama.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;"">spending millions</A> in the 2012 presidential elections in the USA to support politicians perceived as more inclined to approve projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline and more ready to reduce regulatory burdens and allow more drilling on federal lands. A 2012 report from the <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/scientific_integrity/a-<mark>climate</mark>-of-corporate-control-summary.pdf"">Union of Concerned Scientists</A> describes how the public relations messages on <mark>climate change</mark> issued by corporations are often contradicted by the corporations’ actions.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Perhaps surprisingly, many oil companies support a <A href=""https://skepticalscience.com/<mark>co2</mark>-limits-economy-advanced.htm""><mark>carbon</mark> tax</A>. In some cases this may be companies seeking a way to favour gas production over more <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive coal, but some <A href=""http://thetyee.ca/News/2012/06/20/<mark>Carbon</mark>-Tax-Supporters/"">oil sands companies</A> support a <mark>carbon</mark> tax as well. The reason for this is because corporations are very keen to reduce uncertainty, especially when it comes to long-term capital intensive projects. They would prefer to know the rules now and then decide what to invest in, rather than invest now and discover later that their project is no longer economic due to taxation changes. More details on this can be found in a report by the <A href=""http://www.<mark>sustainable</mark>prosperity.ca/dl352&amp;display""><mark>Sustainable</mark> Prosperity</A> think tank.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Although some of the oil company <mark>climate</mark> action statements may appear to the cynical to be mere <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing"">greenwash</A> (i.e., PR promises devoid of content), some actions have produced real results, notably efforts to reduce methane leakage. A recent paper in <EM>Nature</EM> by <A href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v488/n7412/full/nature11342.html"">Simpson et al (2012)</A> (paywalled but see also the article in <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>central.org/news/study-shows-less-methane-in-air-thanks-to-leakage-control-14864""><mark>Climate</mark> Central</A>) linked observed declines in atmospheric ethane to reduced fugitive emissions of methane (and associated ethane) from oil and gas operations. Simpson and her colleagues estimate that this may have reduced methane emissions by 10-21 Tg/yr (million tonnes per year), and that this could account for 30-70% of the total decline in methane emissions since 1984. If true, this would be the only <mark>climate</mark> mitigation action ever to have shown results detectable at the <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Methane.jpg"">Mauna Loa Observatory</A>. On the other hand, atmospheric methane concentrations have recently started to climb again, perhaps due to recent increased rates of shale gas drilling.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Nobody should be under the illusion that oil companies are going to lead the fight against <mark>climate change</mark>. The actions required to deal with the <mark>climate</mark> crisis will mean rendering obsolete the core competencies and assets of fossil fuel corporations and it would be folly to expect these (figurative) turkeys to vote for Christmas. (See Bill McKibben’s article <A href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719"">Global Warming’s Terrifying New Math</A> and the <A href=""http://www.<mark>carbon</mark>tracker.org/<mark>carbon</mark>bubble""><mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker</A> report.) We should, however, acknowledge that the companies no longer actively oppose the science and, for the most part, have stopped directly funding the groups that do. That’s probably the best that <mark>climate</mark> activists can hope for from commercial organizations whose business is in extracting hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s fuels from the Earth so that their customers can burn them and dispose of the waste into the atmosphere.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">But there’s also an important lesson here for those individuals who persist in rejecting or downplaying the consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>: if the big oil companies can suck it up and face scientific reality, why can’t you?</P><P>Posted by Andy Skuce on Friday, 26 October, 2012</P></BODY></HTML>"

                                By <SPAN>Kelly Gilblom</SPAN> on <SPAN>4/17/2018</SPAN></DIV><P>LONDON (Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest oil companies, for long typecast as villains of <mark>climate change</mark>, are seeking to reinvent themselves as environmental pioneers.                               </P><P>“We’re not going to be sitting back and say let’s see what society does and we’ll follow that,” said Ben van Beurden, chief executive officer of Royal Dutch Shell. “We’re more than prepared to be assertive and lean forward and say: ‘This is what it takes.”’</P><P>Irked by a shareholder resolution that would force Europe’s largest oil company to create specific emissions targets, the CEO took the unusual step of engaging with five reporters on Monday about Shell’s vision for a de<mark>carbon</mark>ized world. Not only is Shell implementing its own, much stronger, measures to manage the energy transition, according to Van Beurden, but it can also drag the rest of the world along with it.</P><P>Proving to activists and shareholders that they care about the <mark>climate</mark> is becoming an essential preoccupation for oil majors. Hours after Van Beurden reached out, <mark>BP Plc</mark> hosted dozens of analysts, journalists, politicians and technocrats at its office to explain what it was doing about emissions.</P><P>BP wheeled out its entire executive team, with five giving speeches about what specifically they were doing about <mark>climate change</mark>. In the audience sat former CEO John Browne, who pioneered the company’s ill-fated “Beyond Petroleum” rebranding campaign.</P><P><STRONG>Goals Commended</STRONG></P><P>In search of wider affirmation, BP brought a <mark>climate</mark> scientist, Princeton University’s Stephen Pacala. He commended BP’s emissions goals and said fossil fuel companies would be an important part of the future. Environmentalist and CEO of The Nature Conservancy, Mark Tercek, added his praise via Skype.</P><P>Not everyone was convinced. Hours before the BP event, a former adviser to the company and head of an environmental think-tank told The Guardian that its targets were “lightweight PR” and “greenwashing.”</P><P>Still, the presentations show an oil industry that is far from a cabal of <mark>climate</mark>-change deniers.</P><P>A key test of the effectiveness of Big Oil’s new resolve will focus on its fight for a <mark>carbon</mark> price. When asked last year by a senior policymaker why Shell didn’t advocate for stronger <mark>carbon</mark> pricing, Van Beurden was surprised. His company had been doing so for decades.</P><P>“The real, honest, naked assessment is we have not been very successful” in getting the message out about <mark>carbon</mark>, he told reporters on Monday. “Apparently the message hasn’t reached them.&quot;</P><H1>Related News ///</H1></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></CENTER></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

And increasingly we’re seeing their chief executives responding. The question is though, how much is for real and what's just greenwash?</P><P>It’s been just over a year since the Paris <mark>climate</mark> deal was agreed in December 2015 and slowly corporate annual reports are being filed. In these, companies take stock of the year’s changes and assess the future risks to their business. Meanwhile new strategies and corporate statements are being issued. Statoil recently <A href=""https://www.desmog.co.uk/2017/03/10/Statoil-Claims-to-Care-About-<mark>Climate</mark>-Change-Commits-Future-to-Oil-and-Gas"">released a <mark>climate</mark> roadmap</A> and ConocoPhillips has come out <A href=""http://www.smartbrief.com/s/2017/03/us-shouldnt-exit-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-says-conocophillips-ceo"">in support of the <SPAN class=""caps"">US</SPAN> remaining part of the Paris Agreement</A>.</P><P>But what are we to make of all of this? Do the actions of these oil giants match the big words put out by their chief executives when it comes to <mark>climate change</mark>? Has anything really changed since Paris?</P><H3><STRONG>Royal Dutch Shell</STRONG></H3><P>It feels like Shell is going through a bit of an identity crisis. On the one hand, it’s been pretty clear about the risk <mark>climate change</mark> poses to its business and the need to transition to renewable energy. But on the other hand, it sees this as a slow, decadal process and has a record of lobbying against <mark>climate</mark> action.</P><P>Last week headlines were made when Shell announced it was selling off most of its Canadian oil sands assets. Mixed in with this also was <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shell-divestiture-cdn-natural-rsc-idUSKBN16G0PH"">the news</A> that it would now be tying 10 percent of its directors’ bonuses to how well they manage greenhouse gas emissions in their operations.</P><P>It also aims to invest $1 billion in renewable energy by the end of the decade.</P><P>But a look at the bigger picture shows that while these are steps in the right direction, they’re relatively small steps given Shell’s total annual spending comes to $25 billion.</P><P>And according to <A href=""http://energypost.eu/<mark>carbon</mark>-capture-and-use-how-<mark>climate</mark>-friendly-is-it/"">a recent article</A> written by Shell’s <mark>climate</mark> advisor David Hone, the company has “no immediate plans to move to a net-zero emissions portfolio over our investment horizon of 10-20 years”.</P><P>That said, Shell appears to be somewhat ahead of the curve compared to other oil majors. Maybe it's making up for lost time, or perhaps it doesn't want to be left in the dust. Either way, it's not entirely burying its head in the sand. In its <A href=""https://www.desmog.co.uk/2016/03/12/shell-and-chevron-two-oil-giants-two-very-different-approaches-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">annual report last year</A> for the year up to December 2015 it was the first company to recognize that policy action and legal risks due to rising <mark>climate change</mark> concerns are mounting. These same concerns are repeated in <A href=""http://www.shell.com/media/annual-reports-and-publications.html"">this year’s report</A>.</P><P>However, this comes after the <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/28/shell-knew-oil-giants-1991-film-warned-<mark>climate</mark>-change-danger"">Guardian revealed</A> that Shell knew of the impact fossil fuels would have on the <mark>climate</mark> as far back as 1991. In a film on temperature and sea level rise the oil giant accurately predicts what scientists now all agree on about <mark>climate</mark> change.</P><P>Yet, despite the company’s own data, it has spent decades investing in unconventional oil and gas projects. Projects which it has always known are incompatible with tackling <mark>climate</mark> change.</P><H3><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN></STRONG></H3><P>Meanwhile, <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN> is facing <A href=""http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bp-faces-questions-on-growth-prospects-dfdwbw6p5"">significant pressure to boost production</A>. Part of this effort means it continues to expand into more and more challenging projects in search of bigger returns. But it’s having some trouble.</P><P>After strong public opposition to its plans to drill in the pristine waters of the Great Australian Bight it pulled out of the deepwater venture. And now it’s planning a similarly controversial project: drilling for oil near a <A href=""http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2017/01/30/amazon-reef-mouth-bp-total-oil-drilling/"">recently discovered coral reef</A> off the coast of Brazil.</P><P>The company also isn’t performing as well as it would have hoped, with share prices currently sitting 30 percent lower than before its Deepwater Horizon disaster.  All of this has led to rumours of takeovers, with <A href=""http://www.standard.co.uk/business/bp-takeover-chatter-bubbles-back-to-surface-a3486576.html"">reports last week</A> that Exxon was eyeing up the British oil giant.</P><P>And as it continues to lay off workers from its drilling operations on the North Sea, a <A href=""https://www.desmog.co.uk/2017/03/13/revealed-bp-puts-branding-local-schools-while-cutting-north-sea-jobs"">DeSmog <SPAN class=""caps"">UK</SPAN> investigation</A> shows <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN> has been working hard to boost its social license by putting <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN>-branded tutors in primary and secondary schools all across Aberdeen.</P><P>In the <SPAN class=""caps"">US</SPAN>, however, <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN> chief executive Bob Dudley seems encouraged by the change in winds that came with a new White House administration. <A href=""http://www.naturalgasworld.com/bp-rebuilds-for-growth-36200"">Dudley recently said</A> that the political situation meant business is much more open now, saying that the White House is “very interested” in <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN>, “more so than at any times in the last eight years”.</P><P>As <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN> continues to push into riskier projects – and riskier in all senses of the word, from its operations to the <mark>climate</mark> and the marine environment – it will be interesting to see what <A href=""http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/investors/results-and-reporting/annual-report.html"">its annual report</A> (yet to be published) makes of all of this. Last year’s simply recognizes the impact that complying with <mark>climate change</mark> regulations and laws may have on its profit margin.</P><H3><STRONG>Chevron</STRONG></H3><P>Compared to last year, Chevron’s come a long way. Whereas its chief executive John Watson boasted last year that the world will always need Big Oil this year it too has publicly recognized to its investors that <mark>climate change</mark> lawsuits can pose a risk to its profits.</P><P>In its <A href=""http://investor.chevron.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=130102&amp;p=irol-SECText&amp;TEXT=aHR0cDovL2FwaS50ZW5rd2l6YXJkLmNvbS9maWxpbmcueG1sP2lwYWdlPTExNDE2ODY2JkRTRVE9MCZTRVE9MCZTUURFU0M9U0VDVElPTl9FTlRJUkUmc3Vic2lkPTU3#sC86D008E5E23527992562203BD19296B"">annual report</A> for the year up to December 2016 it states: “increasing attention to <mark>climate change</mark> risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and, potentially, private litigation against the company.”</P><P>But amidst growing demand from shareholders for corporate disclosure on <mark>climate</mark> risks, Chevron this month said in a <A href=""https://www.chevron.com/-/media/chevron/shared/documents/<mark>climate</mark>-risk-perspective.pdf"">quietly released report</A> that a transition to lower-<mark>carbon</mark> energy sources would pose only a “minimal risk” to its operations because it’s investing in these options too. It then goes on to explain that oil and gas will remain the fundamental energy sources.</P><H3><STRONG>ExxonMobil</STRONG></H3><P>Like <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN>, Exxon fails to go beyond the impact of <mark>climate</mark> regulations on its profits.

<A href=""http://www.sfexaminer.com/author/bcn_sfex/"" title=""Posts by Bay City News"" class=""author url fn"" rel=""author"">Bay City News</A> on March 21, 2018 5:40 pm</DIV><P>A lawyer for Chevron Corp. told a federal judge in San Francisco Wednesday that the company “accepts the consensus of the scientific community” that <mark>climate change</mark> is real and is caused primarily by human activity.</P><P>“That has been Chevron’s position for a decade,” attorney Theodore Boutrous told U.S. District Judge William Alsup.</P><P>Boutrous spoke at an unusual tutorial session scheduled by Alsup in connection with two lawsuits filed against San Ramon-based Chevron and four other oil and gas companies by San Francisco and Oakland.</P><P>The cities claim the corporations created a public nuisance by promoting the use of oil and natural gas while knowing that the fuels lead to the “grave danger” of global warming and rising sea levels. </P><P>They also claim the companies engaged in public relations campaigns to downplay the risks in the 1990s and early 2000s.</P><P>The suits ask for financial compensation, possibly in the billions of dollars, to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to protect people and property against rising sea levels and global warming.</P><P>Alsup did not issue any rulings during the session, but is expected to schedule a hearing later this spring on a bid by the five companies for dismissal of the case.</P><P>The companies claim in a motion filed Tuesday that the case doesn’t belong in federal court.</P><P>“There’s no doubt that warming is a global issue that requires global debate and engagement,” Boutrous told Alsup. “This is not a case about whether global warming exists. It is about whether a court like this one is the right way to deal with it.”</P><P>Tutorial sessions are occasionally used by judges to gain background on scientifically or technologically complex cases. For this session, Alsup asked for information about the history of scientific study of <mark>climate change</mark> and current science on global warming and sea level rise. He gave each side two hours. </P><P>Boutrous said Chevron is relying on a 2013 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, an international agency that synthesizes research by hundreds of scientists.</P><P>He said Chevron accepts the report’s conclusion that “It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.”</P><P>But Boutrous sought to emphasize parts of the IPCC report and other reports that showed uncertainty in predicting the extent of future temperature and sea-level increases.</P><P>In one example, Boutrous showed a 2017 state of California report that showed a 96 percent chance of a rise of one foot in the sea level at the Golden Gate entrance to San Francisco Bay by 2100, a 70 percent chance of a 2-foot rise and a 28 percent chance of a 3-foot rise. </P><P>But Alsup commented, “In other words, there’s a 50-50 chance of something between two and three feet. That’s still a lot of water, isn’t it?”</P><P>In addition to Chevron, the other companies sued are <mark>BP PLC</mark>, ConocoPhillips Co., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC. The other companies did not make presentations today, but Alsup instructed them to tell him within two weeks of any Chevron statements they disagree with. Otherwise, they will be deemed to agree, he said. </P><P>While Chevron chose a lawyer for its tutorial, San Francisco and Oakland selected three scientists.</P><P>Gary Griggs, an earth sciences professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz, noted that the 2017 California report said the rate of ice melting in Antarctica and Greenland has increased and that “waiting for absolute certainty is not an option.”</P><P>Griggs said the effects of sea level rises are worsened by other phenomena such as king tides and El Nino events.</P><P>He showed pictures of the San Francisco Embarcadero flooded during a king tide and a hypothetical map showing that more than half of Oakland International Airport would be submerged if the sea level rises by 3 feet.</P><P>University of Illinois atmospheric science professor Don Wuebbles, who contributed to the 2013 IPCC report, said, “The science did not stop at 2012. There is a lot we have learned in the past five years.”</P><P>Wuebbles said predictions are now more certain and the rate of increase in sea level is higher than at any time in the last 2,800 years.</P><P>“Our projections are a rise of one to 4 feet by the end of the century, but it could be as high as 8 feet,” he said.</P><P>Alsup has set a briefing schedule for the companies’ motion to dismiss that could extend to the end of April, meaning that a hearing would not be held until May.</P><P>San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement, “What we saw today was one oil company begrudgingly accepting the scientific consensus while trying to overemphasize the extent of scientific uncertainty.</P><P>“These companies have made enormous profits while putting our cities in harm’s way. Now the bill has come due. It’s time for them to pay for the seawalls and other infrastructure needed to protect San Francisco and Oakland,” Herrera said. </P><P><EM>-Julia Cheever, Bay City News</EM></P><H2><A href=""#disqus_comments"">Click here</A> or scroll down to comment</H2><DIV class=""extras-mobile""><H3>Trending Articles</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The scale of historical emissions associated with these fossil fuel producers is large enough to have contributed significantly to <mark>climate change</mark>, according to the report.</P><P> ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron are identified as among the highest emitting investor-owned companies since 1988. If fossil fuels continue to be extracted at the same rate over the next 28 years as they were between 1988 and 2017, says the report, global average temperatures would be on course to rise by 4C by the end of the century. This is likely to have <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/31/planet-will-warm-4c-2100-<mark>climate</mark>"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">catastrophic consequences</A> including substantial species extinction and global food scarcity risks.</P><P>While companies have a huge role to play in driving <mark>climate change</mark>, says Faria, the barrier is the “absolute tension” between short-term profitability and the urgent need to reduce emissions.</P><P>A <A href=""http://www.<mark>carbon</mark>tracker.org/report/stranded-assets-danger-zone/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""><mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker study</A> in 2015 found that fossil fuel companies risked wasting <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/25/fossil-fuel-companies-risk-wasting-2tn-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">more than $2tn</A> over the coming decade by pursuing coal, oil and gas projects that could be worthless in the face of international action on <mark>climate change</mark> and advances in renewables – in turn posing substantial threats to investor returns.</P><P>CDP says its aims with the <mark>carbon</mark> majors project are both to improve transparency among fossil fuel producers and to help investors understand the emissions associated with their fossil fuel holdings. </P><P>A fifth of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions are backed by public investment, according to the report. “That puts a significant responsibility on those investors to engage with <mark>carbon</mark> majors and urge them to disclose <mark>climate</mark> risk,” says Faria.</P><P>Investors should move out of fossil fuels, says Michael Brune, executive director of US environmental organisation the Sierra Club. “Not only is it morally risky, it’s economically risky. The world is moving away from fossil fuels towards clean energy and is doing so at an accelerated pace. Those left holding investments in fossil fuel companies will find their investments becoming more and more risky over time.”</P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-2 | 2""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">G20 public finance for fossil fuels 'is four times more than renewables'</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P>There is a “growing wave of companies that are acting in the opposite manner to the companies in this report,” says Brune. Nearly 100 companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Ikea have committed to 100% renewable power under the <A href=""http://re100.org/companies"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">RE100 initiative</A>. <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/05/volvo-cars-electric-hybrid-2019"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Volvo recently announced</A> that all its cars would be electric or hybrid from 2019. </P><P>And oil and gas companies are also embarking on green investments.

A BP spokesperson says its “determined to be part of the solution” for <mark>climate change</mark> and is “investing in renewables and low-<mark>carbon</mark> <mark>innovation</mark>.” And ExxonMobil, which has faced <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-<mark>climate</mark>-change-1981-<mark>climate</mark>-denier-funding"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">heavy criticism</A> for its environmental record, has been <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/21/oil-majors-investments-renewable-energy-solar-wind"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">exploring <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage</A>.</P><P>But for many the sums involved and pace of change are nowhere near enough. A research paper published last year by Paul Stevens, an academic at think tank Chatham House, said international oil companies were no longer fit for purpose and warned these multinationals that they faced a <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/oil-firms-environment-energy-<mark>climate</mark>-change"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">“nasty, brutish and short” end</A> within the next 10 years if they did not completely change their business models. </P><P>Investors now have a choice, according to Charlie Kronick, senior programme advisor at Greenpeace UK. “The future of the oil industry has already been written: the choice is will its decline be managed, returning capital to shareholders to be reinvested in the genuine industries of the future, or will they hold on, hoping not be the last one standing when the music stops?”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It's the type of litigation that legal experts say may become more common as coastal cities and waterlogged counties draw the connection between rising waters and the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. Two California counties and a separate city, also in California, filed similar lawsuits in July (<A href=""https://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/stories/1060057519/""><EM><mark>Climate</mark>wire</EM></A>, July 18).</P><P>Parker said in an interview that her office has been mulling such a lawsuit for about a year and that it couldn't be delayed any longer.</P><P>“We can't wait until it's upon us,” Parker said of increasing water levels. “That's the urgency of the situation.”</P><P>The defendants “promoted fossil fuels and fossil fuel products for unlimited use in massive quantities with knowledge of the hazard that such use would create,” the San Francisco <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/assets/2017/09/20/document_pm_02.pdf"">suit</A> says. The Oakland <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/assets/2017/09/20/document_pm_03.pdf"">complaint</A> makes the same argument.</P><P>Both lawsuits draw inspiration from litigation brought against tobacco companies in the 1990s. The cases accused the industry of promoting a deadly product even though insiders knew smoking was dangerous.</P><P>Asked why she chose to make sea-level rise the focus of the case, Parker said it is a signal of <mark>climate change</mark> that's easy to understand.</P><P>“That's what you can clearly see, and it's been proven, and you can see it every day,” she said. “We have a very simple and straightforward case.”</P><P>The defendants did not warm to the new paperwork.</P><P>“Chevron welcomes serious attempts to address the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>, but these suits do not do that,” the company said.</P><P>A spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell called <mark>climate change</mark> a “complex societal challenge” to be addressed by governments, “not by the courts.”</P><P>Similarly, an Exxon spokesman said the cases lack merit. A ConocoPhillips spokesman declined to comment, citing a practice against discussing active cases. And BP did not respond to an emailed request.</P><P>The court papers filed Tuesday night provide maps of both cities showing which buildings are expected to be underwater by 2100. The Oakland airport is in the flood zone, according to maps city officials submitted. The legal complaints also cite an internal Exxon document from 1982. Its authors predicted that global temperatures will rise 3 degrees Celsius before the century ends.</P><P>The law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP is helping the plaintiffs. So is Matt Pawa, a well-known environmental lawyer with a specialty in <mark>climate change</mark> cases.</P><P>He helped argue the landmark environmental case <EM>American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut</EM>, which wound its way to the Supreme Court. Pawa also led the plaintiffs in a 2008 case, <EM>Kivalina v.

<mark>BP plc</mark> is a global energy company with a market capitalisation of £88 billion, a workforce of 74,500 and operations in over 70 countries world-wide, making it one of the UK’s largest companies. Its current strategy recognises the need to look for low <mark>carbon</mark> alternatives to mitigate the concerns over <mark>climate change</mark>.</P> <H3>Engagement with BP</H3><P style=""margin-bottom: 12pt;"">As a responsible investor we proactively engage on any issue which may affect a company’s ability to deliver long-term <mark>sustainable</mark> performance and value. Our engagement activities with <mark>BP plc</mark> therefore draw on a variety of issues, such as, sustainability, strategy, remuneration, board composition and succession planning. Examples of areas we have discussed include:</P><H3 style=""margin-bottom: 12pt;"">Executive Remuneration</H3><P>
At BP’s Annual General Meeting in May 2016, the remuneration report was voted against by 60% of the shareholders who voted. This reflected significant concerns amongst shareholders with the remuneration.
As a general principle, remuneration should be simple, transparent and should clearly align with the company’s strategy. Over the last year, numerous discussions were held with the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on simplifying the structure, reducing the overall quantum, maintaining the focus on health and safety and supporting the development of low-<mark>carbon</mark>/natural gas technologies.</P><P>In May 2017 shareholders were asked to vote on a new remuneration policy for executive directors. The revised policy reflected these discussions and, on this basis, we voted in favour of the new remuneration policy.  The revised policy was supported by 97% of shareholders who voted.</P><H3>Diversity</H3><P>
Board and senior management diversity is a growing focus for M&amp;G. Given the lack of diversity on the BP Executive Committee, we discussed how diversity was considered across the organisation. We were reassured that there is a strong and diverse talent pool at senior management level.</P><H3>Sustainability</H3><P>At M&amp;G we believe in the value of meaningful engagement with companies on material ESG issues. Having held a number of sustainability-focused meetings with BP over the years, we are considering an engagement to assess how BP is managing its transition to a lower <mark>carbon</mark> world. This will be in addition to engaging with BP on the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on <mark>Climate</mark> Related Financial Disclosure. We believe BP can play an important role in setting market standards on sustainability disclosures.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""container-fluid""><DIV class=""text-content rich-text"">

(Craig Ruttle/AP)</DIV></DIV><P data-elm-loc=""1"">The New York City government is suing the world’s five largest publicly traded oil companies, seeking to hold them responsible for present and future damage to the city from <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P data-elm-loc=""2"">The suit, filed Tuesday against BP, Chevron, Conoco-Phillips, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, claims the companies together produced 11 percent of all of global-warming gases through the oil and gas products they have sold over the years. It also charges that the companies and the industry they are part of have known for some time about the consequences but sought to obscure them.</P><P data-elm-loc=""3"">“In this litigation, the City seeks to shift the costs of protecting the City from <mark>climate change</mark> impacts back onto the companies that have done nearly all they could to create this existential threat,” reads the lawsuit, brought by New York corporation counsel Zachary Carter and filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.</P><P data-elm-loc=""4"">The legal strategy has already been embraced by several California cities and counties, but prior lawsuits seeking to blame companies for their role in causing <mark>climate change</mark> have foundered.</P><P data-elm-loc=""5"">It remains unclear whether a new wave of litigation — propelled by stronger <mark>climate</mark> science, reports about how much some companies knew about <mark>climate change</mark> decades ago, and somewhat divergent legal strategies — will succeed where those efforts failed.</P><P data-elm-loc=""6"">In California last year, Marin County, San Mateo County and the city of Imperial Beach similarly <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/07/20/this-could-be-the-next-big-strategy-for-suing-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">sued</A> a group of fossil fuel companies over damage related to <mark>climate change</mark> — citing a theory called “public nuisance,” which basically argues that companies are causing an injury to the localities under common law. The cities of San Francisco and Oakland and the city and county of Santa Cruz have also filed suit.</P><P data-elm-loc=""7"">“I think the significant development here is that this is the first of these cases in this last year that’s filed outside of California,” said Michael Burger, who directs the Sabin Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Law at Columbia University. If more and more localities sue, “we might be able to see adequate pressure applied to these companies to inspire action on <mark>climate change</mark>,” he said.</P><P data-elm-loc=""8"">So far, that has not been the response. ExxonMobil has instead <A href=""http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/09/investing/exxon-<mark>climate</mark>-change-california-san-francisco-oakland/index.html"" target=""_blank"">reacted strongly</A> to the claims, <A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4345487-Exxon-Texas-Petition-Jan-2018.html"" target=""_blank"">seeking in Texas court</A> to depose California state officials and others involved in bringing the cases for “potential claims of abuse of process, civil conspiracy, and violation of ExxonMobil’s civil rights.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""9""><mark>Climate change</mark> “is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-<mark>carbon</mark> choices for businesses and consumers,” Curtis Smith, head of U.S. media relations for Shell, wrote by email, “not by the courts.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""10"">BP and ConocoPhillips, two other defendants named in the lawsuit, declined to comment.</P><P data-elm-loc=""11"">Exxon <A href=""https://energyfactor.exxonmobil.com/perspectives/better-approach-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" target=""_blank"">responded</A> to New York’s lawsuit on its blog, where the firm has also challenged investigative reports from Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News and the Los Angeles Times that showed the company was an early pioneer in <mark>climate</mark>-change science in the 1980s, reports that were cited in the suit.</P><P data-elm-loc=""12"">“ExxonMobil welcomes any well-meaning and good faith attempt to address the risks of <mark>climate change</mark>,” wrote Suzanne McCarron, Exxon’s vice president of public and government affairs. “Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions. Lawsuits of this kind — filed by trial attorneys against an industry that provides products we all rely upon to power the economy and enable our domestic life — simply do not do that.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""13"">Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall said in an email: “This lawsuit is factually and legally meritless, and will do nothing to address the serious issue of <mark>climate change</mark>. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue that requires global engagement.

The three states characterized their brief as focusing on “a subset of issues where our States are in a position to offer a fuller picture of the case law and relevant statutes and regulations.” First, they contested the position of the fossil fuel companies and other amici states advocating for dismissal of the lawsuits that Oakland and San Francisco’s complaints asserted non-justiciable political questions. They also said that the complaints did not threaten state <mark>climate</mark> programs or jeopardize cooperative federalism.

All of the defendants joined in a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, in which they reiterated arguments from their March 20 motion to dismiss the original complaint: that federal common law claims were either displaced by federal statutes or were “plainly improper”; that the plaintiffs failed to allege the elements of a nuisance claim; and that even if the plaintiffs pleaded a viable claim, judicial resolution would be inappropriate because it would violate separation of powers. Each defendant other than Chevron Corporation also filed a new motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, and Royal Dutch Shell plc (Shell) again also sought dismissal on the basis of insufficient service of process. The defendants addressed four questions that the court on March 27 had requested be addressed in the briefing on the motion to dismiss. They said they were aware of no cases sustaining a nuisance theory of liability based on the otherwise lawful sale of a product where the seller finance or sponsored research or advertising intended to cast doubt on studies showing that use of the product was harmful. They also told the court that “no global-warming-based nuisance claim has ever made it past the pleadings,” argued that the plaintiffs sought to hold them liable for speech “plainly immunized” by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, and asserted that the plaintiffs’ “expansive theory of liability has no limiting principle.” The plaintiffs’ response to the motions to dismiss was due by May 3, and defendants’ replies were due by May 10. The court had also set a deadline of May 10 for the United States to submit an amicus brief if it wished to do so. A hearing on the motions to dismiss was scheduled for May 24. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/19/2018</TD><TD>Motion to dismiss first amended complaints for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by BP p.l.c.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/18/2018</TD><TD>Motion filed by United States for extension of time to consider whether to participate as amicus curiae.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/18/2018</TD><TD>Order issued setting deadline of May 10, 2018 for United States to file amicus brief.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/04/2018</TD><TD>Redlined first amended complaint filed by plaintiffs (San Francisco).</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/04/2018</TD><TD>Redlined first amended complaint filed by plaintiffs (Oakland).</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/04/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180404_docket-317-cv-06011_order-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Order issued setting schedules for motions to dismiss amended complaint.</TD><TD>The court deemed the March 20 motions to dismiss withdrawn, and new motions to dismiss the amended complaints are due on April 19.

The five named defendants joined in a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. First, they argued that Congress had displaced federal common law claims based on domestic activities, whether those activities involved combustion of fossil fuels (in which case the Clean Air Act displaced federal common law) or production and promotion of fossil fuels (in which case “many federal statutes … expressly regulate (and, in fact, encourage) such conduct)). The defendants also argued that federal common law principles would not support recognition of a claim based on the defendants’ foreign activities. Second, the fossil fuel companies argued that elements of a federal common law claim for public nuisance were absent. The defendants asserted (1) that the plaintiffs had not alleged and could not allege that the defendants’ conduct was unauthorized by law; (2) that it was undisputed that the defendants did not control the fossil fuels at the time of the alleged creation of the nuisance (i.e., the time of combustion); (3) that the complaint’s allegations did not establish causation, since the claims depended “on an attenuated causal chain including billions of intervening third parties—i.e., fossil fuel users like Plaintiffs themselves—and complex environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades”; and (4) that the damages sought by the plaintiffs in the form of an “abatement fund” could not be awarded because plaintiffs had not alleged actual harm, only “speculative future harms that may never eventuate.” The defendants also argued that damages would violate the defendants’ due process and First Amendment rights. Finally, the defendants asserted that judicial relief would violate separation of powers by invading the executive branch’s authority to conduct foreign affairs and legislative authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180320_docket-317-cv-06011_motion-to-dismiss-2.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by ConocoPhillips Company.</TD><TD>Four of the defendants filed separate motions to dismiss on personal jurisdiction grounds, arguing that the court could not exercise either general jurisdiction over the companies—two of which were non-U.S. companies and two of which were headquartered in Texas and incorporated in other states (one in New Jersey, one in Delaware)—or specific jurisdiction based on the companies’ alleged activities in and contacts with California.

Connecticut; Requested “Tutorial” on <mark>Climate Change</mark>.</STRONG> The federal district court for the Northern District of California denied Oakland’s and San Francisco’s motions to remand their <mark>climate change</mark> public nuisance lawsuits against five major fossil fuel producers to state court. The court held that federal common law necessarily governed the nuisance claims because “[a] patchwork of fifty different answers to the same fundamental global issue would be unworkable” and “the extent of any judicial relief should be uniform across our nation.” The court stated: “Plaintiffs’ claims for public nuisance, though pled as state-law claims, depend on a global complex of geophysical cause and effect involving all nations of the planet (and the oceans and atmosphere). It necessarily involves the relationships between the United States and all other nations. It demands to be governed by as universal a rule of apportioning responsibility as is available.” The court dispensed with the cities’ three primary arguments for remanding the cases. First, the court said the cities’ novel theories of liability based on the defendants’ sales of their product did not differentiate their claims from earlier transboundary <mark>pollution</mark> suits in which the Supreme Court (American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut) and Ninth Circuit (Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp.) applied federal common law. Second, the court said the Clean Air Act did not displace the plaintiffs’ federal common law claims, allowing state law to govern; the court said that while the Clean Air Act spoke directly to the “domestic emissions” issues presented in American Electric Power and Kivalina, “[h]ere, the Clean Air Act does not provide a sufficient legislative solution to the nuisance alleged to warrant a conclusion that this legislation has occupied the field to the exclusion of federal common law.” Third, the court said the well-pleaded complaint rule did not bar removal. The court also indicated in dicta that “the very instrumentality of plaintiffs’ alleged injury — the flooding of coastal lands — is, by definition, the navigable waters of the United States. Plaintiffs’ claims therefore necessarily implicate an area quintessentially within the province of the federal courts.” The court said defendants had not waived this issue. The court certified the decision for interlocutory appeal, finding that the issue of whether the nuisance claims were removable because such claims are governed by federal common law was a controlling question as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that resolution by the court of appeals would materially advance the litigation. The court’s order also noted that six similar actions brought by other California municipalities were pending before another judge in the district and those actions asserted additional non-nuisance claims. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/19/2018</TD><TD>Defendants' reply to plaintiffs' supplemental brief on navigable waters of the United States filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/19/2018</TD><TD>Plaintiffs' supplemental reply brief on navigable waters of the United States filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/16/2018</TD><TD>Defendants' response to request for supplemental briefing filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/16/2018</TD><TD>Plaintiffs' supplemental brief on navigable waters of the United States filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/12/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180212_docket-317-cv-06011_request-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Request for supplemental briefing issued.</TD><TD><STRONG>Federal Court in Oakland and California <mark>Climate Change</mark> Suits Against Fossil Fuel Producers Asked for Additional Briefing on Navigable Waters Issue.</STRONG> The federal district court for the Northern District of California considering whether to remand Oakland and San Francisco's <mark>climate change</mark> lawsuits against fossil fuel producers issued a request for supplemental briefing on the issue of how the concept of “navigable waters of the United States” related to removal jurisdiction.

The plaintiffs also argued that the bankruptcy removal statute did not provide a basis for removal based on the 30-year-old bankruptcy of Texaco, a subsidiary of defendant Chevron Corporation. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>11/08/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20171108_docket-317-cv-06011_order.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Administrative motion to relate cases denied.</TD><TD><STRONG>California Federal Court Denied Oil and Gas Companies’ Motion to Relate San Francisco and Oakland <mark>Climate</mark> Cases to Other Pending Cases.</STRONG> The Executive Committee for the Northern District of California denied the motion by defendants in <mark>climate change</mark> cases brought by the Oakland and San Francisco city attorneys to relate those two cases to the pending cases brought by San Mateo and Marin Counties and the City of Imperial Beach.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>11/06/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20171106_docket-317-cv-06011_na-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Statement regarding administrative motion to relate cases filed by San Mateo and Marin Counties and City of Imperial Beach.</TD><TD>San Mateo and Marin Counties and the City of Imperial Beach took no position on the defendants' administrative motion to relate their cases to the cases brought by Oakland and San Francisco.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>11/03/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20171103_docket-317-cv-06011_opposition.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Joint response filed by Oakland and San Francisco in opposition to administrative motion to relate cases.</TD><TD>San Francisco and Oakland opposed relating the cases to the cases brought by San Mateo and Marin Counties and the City of Imperial Beach.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>11/02/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20171102_docket-317-cv-06011_motion.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Administrative motion filed by defendants to relate cases.</TD><TD>The defendants moved to relate Oakland's and San Francisco's cases to the lawsuits brought by San Mateo and Marin Counties and the City of Imperial Beach. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>10/20/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20171020_docket-317-cv-06011_notice.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Notice of removal filed by defendants.</TD><TD><STRONG>Oil and Gas Companies Removed San Francisco and Oakland <mark>Climate</mark> Cases to Federal Court.</STRONG> On October 20, 2017, the five oil and gas company defendants in the City of San Francisco’s and City of Oakland’s <mark>climate change</mark> nuisance lawsuits removed the cases to federal court.

The three U.S.-based companies are Chevron Corporation, Exxon Mobil Corporation, and ConocoPhillips. In a joint memorandum of law, these companies argued that New York City’s claims arise under federal common law and that the Clean Air Act has displaced the federal common law or, alternatively, that the plaintiffs’ “expansive derivative theory of liability” fails to state a claim that complies with federal common law standards. The defendants also argued that the claims infringe on the federal foreign affairs power, are barred by the Commerce Clause and Due Process and Takings Clauses, and are preempted by federal law. In addition, the three companies contended that the City does not state viable state law claims and that the claims are not justiciable because they do not present a justiciable case or controversy; because they present political questions; and because the City lacks standing.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/23/2018</TD><TD>Memorandum of law filed in support of Exxon Mobil Corporation's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>01/09/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180109_docket-118-cv-00182_complaint-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Complaint filed.</TD><TD><STRONG>New York City Sues Five Largest Fossil Fuel Companies for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Damages.</STRONG> New York City filed a federal lawsuit against the five largest investor-owned fossil fuel producers seeking costs the City had incurred and would continue to incur to protect itself and its residents from the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>. The City filed the lawsuit in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York. The City alleged that the defendants “produced, marketed, and sold massive quantities of fossil fuels” despite knowing for many years that the use of fossil fuels caused emissions of greenhouse gas emissions that would accumulate and remain in the atmosphere for centuries, causing “grave harm.” The City alleged that the five defendants were responsible “for over 11% of all the <mark>carbon</mark> and methane <mark>pollution</mark> from industrial sources that has accumulated in the atmosphere since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution” and that the defendants also were responsible “for leading the public relations strategy for the entire fossil fuel industry, downplaying the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> and promoting fossil fuel use despite the risks.” The City charged that the defendants’ actions constituted an unlawful public and private nuisance and an illegal trespass on City property. The <mark>climate change</mark>-related injuries alleged by the City included more frequent and more intense heat waves, extreme precipitation, and sea level rise. In addition to money damages, the City seeks an equitable order ascertaining the damages and granting an injunction to abate the public nuisance and trespass should the defendants fail to pay the damages for past and permanent injuries.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER class=""site-footer"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""https://schema.org/WPFooter""><DIV class=""wrap""><P>© 2018 ·<A href=""http://columbia<mark>climate</mark>law.com/"" target=""_blank"">Sabin Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Law</A>· U.S. Litigation Chart made in collaboration with <A href=""http://www.apks.com/"" target=""_blank"">Arnold &amp; Porter Kaye Scholer LLP</A></P><DIV class=""disclaimer"">These materials are intended to be a useful resource and may be considered attorney advertising in some jurisdictions.

Dated 1865, it features an area of the city known as North Beach, which back then was covered in ramshackle wooden houses on a sandy slope nuzzled up against the shore. Since then, the coastline has been extended, filled in with sand (<A href=""https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/making-up-ground/"">and most likely boats and other strange things</A>) to stretch several blocks farther into the brackish waters of the San Francisco Bay. A sea wall, <A href=""http://abc7news.com/politics/san-franciscos-cracking-seawall-needs-$250m-makeover/3235921/"">badly in need of repair</A>, keeps the bay at bay.</P><P>That very sea wall is at the heart of the court case — The People of the State of California v. BP P.L.C. et al. — that was the reason for Wednesday’s spectacle. The cities of Oakland and San Francisco are suing the five biggest fossil fuel companies on the planet — BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell — for <A href=""http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/environment/article206025399.html"">billions of dollars</A> for past damages and to prevent future flooding from sea level rise. Since the companies extracted fuel that altered the planet, the argument goes, they should pay for the consequences. It’s a modern version of “you break it, you buy it.” The oil companies have filed to dismiss the lawsuit on many grounds, including that it’s the government’s job to set and enforce <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels — not theirs.</P><P>On Wednesday, no one was yet on trial. <A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber"">U.S. District Judge William Alsup</A> made that very clear to the throng of spectators who filled the chambers, a spillover courtroom and the halls outside. Instead, we were there to see a tutorial, an effort to help this self-described “poor judge” learn the science behind the case. It was going to be a boring morning full of numbers and diagrams, he warned the audience.</P><P>But in this polarized moment, a public tussling over the basics of <mark>climate</mark> science, however cursory, is anything but boring. And as each side in the case presented a history of <mark>climate change</mark> science, it was striking just how much the two sides agreed on: <mark>Climate change</mark> is happening, and humans are in large part responsible. But that’s not really what this court case is about. Rather, it’s about who knew what and when, how much uncertainty there is around future predictions and who should be held responsible (and liable) for a future with higher seas and more extreme weather events. That’s where the cities’ and corporations’ use of evidence diverged.</P><P>First up: the scientists.</P><P>At a big rectangular table in the center of the room, the cities were represented by Steve Berman, a lawyer known for his ability to <A href=""https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43qw3j/meet-the-lawyer-trying-to-make-big-oil-pay-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">get big settlements out of big corporations</A>, as well as some of their own lawyers. But aside from a few introductory remarks, Berman left the talking to a few of the world’s leading experts on <mark>climate change</mark>. First, he called Myles Allen, who is a professor of geosystem science at Oxford University and was tasked with providing a historiography of <mark>climate change</mark> research.</P><P>In true scientist fashion, the talk was filled with jargon and complicated scientific concepts. Alsup, who made clear that he would call out confusing charts or unclear explanations, asked Allen what made <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, which is emitted from burning fossil fuels and have led to a warming planet, special. Allen, equal to the task, began to pantomime his answer. Arms stretched out to the side, fists in a ball, he shimmied left and right, showing how the charge on a <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide molecule could be unevenly distributed, absorbing the infrared waves that are naturally emitted from Earth, unlike oxygen and nitrogen, whose charge is symmetric. That infrared gets trapped within Earth’s atmosphere, instead of escaping, causing the planet to warm.</P><P>After walking through key figures and research from the last century of <mark>climate</mark> science, Allen concluded by saying that we’ve known that the planet was warming since the 1970s. And crucially, he said, we knew back then that we might not know how bad <mark>climate change</mark> would be, or be able to feel and see the effects of that warming, until it was already too late.</P><P>The next speaker, Gary Griggs, an oceanographer who works at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was deep into an explanation of sea level rise when a loud, piercing alarm went off. “Coastal flood alert,” Alsup quipped as soon as it finished. The room broke out in laughter. It wasn’t clear whether it was real or a drill, but nature has a way of making itself known.</P><P>Next up: the lawyers.</P><P>While the cities relied on scientists, the energy companies relied on lawyers. One in particular: Theodore Boutrous, a lawyer for Chevron (which is headquartered in the Bay Area) did all of the talking. And he got straight to the point, answering the question on everyone’s mind: Yes, Chevron accepts the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>. And in honor of that consensus, he’d be relying almost entirely on the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, a United Nations-backed consortium meant to provide a scientific view of what <mark>climate change</mark> is doing to the planet, to lay out his understanding of the science and the history.</P><P>He kicked off by quoting from the IPCC’s <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/"">most recent report</A>, from 2013, citing population growth and economic changes as the most important drivers of <mark>climate change</mark>. The report, he noted, says nothing about fossil-fuel extraction as a driver of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Boutrous offered a history lesson that had a lot in common with Allen’s, but with a much greater focus on the uncertainty around both the science and the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on the Bay Area. He illustrated that uncertainty in various ways, describing how theories that posited alternative roles of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere held sway through at least the 1950s. Boutros also showed how actual temperatures hadn’t been as extreme as many <mark>climate</mark> forecasts predicted in the years leading up to the report. Alsup asked if his point was that the models exaggerated the impact of humans on the <mark>climate</mark>. “Instead of doom and gloom, it’s just gloom?” he asked the lawyer. Boutrous chuckled and moved on.</P><P>Boutrous concluded by showing a map of sea level rise, saying that sea levels had fallen around San Francisco in the years leading up to the 2013 IPCC report. There’s a lot of uncertainty about the future, he concluded, noting that San Francisco and Oakland had reported that <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-municipalities-debt-disclosures-contrast-with-<mark>climate</mark>-warnings-1515456551"">exact message to bond investors</A> in 2017, when the cities said they couldn’t predict whether major flooding or storms might have a major, adverse impact on the local economy.</P><P>Finally, the tutorial pivoted back to the cities, so it pivoted back to the scientists. Don Wuebbles, who is a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois and co-wrote the 2007 IPCC report that helped the organization win the Nobel Peace Prize, was the final scientist called by the cities. He began by pointing out that he’d also led the writing of the first chapter in the 2013 IPCC report that Boutrous had so carefully recounted. “I think it’s important to recognize that science did not stop; there’s a lot we’ve learned in the last five years,” Wuebbles said. That’s why he’d be using <A href=""https://science2017.globalchange.gov/"">data from the U.S. Global Change Research Program</A>, which produces more frequent, national reports on <mark>climate change</mark> to make his presentation.</P><P>The year after the most recent IPCC report was published was the hottest on record, Wuebbles told the court. Then 2015 topped 2014, and 2016 topped 2015. Temperatures are going up, precipitation is increasing, extreme events are more frequent. Looking at a broader set of years, sea level has risen around the San Francisco Bay. Alsup asked Wuebbles whether he disagreed with Boutrous’s recounting of the science.</P><P>Not really, since the lawyer had based his presentation on the IPCC, and a report that Wuebbles was heavily involved with. But Wuebbles’s point was that the IPCC report doesn’t tell all of what we know in 2018. The IPCC report might not be wrong, but that doesn’t mean that it gives the best picture of what’s right.</P><P>As the tutorial concluded, Alsup had a few final remarks. “I wore my science tie today,” he said, pointing to the solar system hanging around his neck before standing up to leave. “I hope someone takes note of that.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV class=""mini-bio""><P>Anna Maria Barry-Jester reports on public health, food and culture for FiveThirtyEight.  <SPAN class=""twitter""><A href=""https://twitter.com/annabarryjester"" target=""_blank""><SPAN class=""twitter-username"">@annabarryjester</SPAN></A></SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class=""tags""><P class=""filed-under"">Filed under</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

      <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""mailto:PHayes@bloomberglaw.com"">Peter Hayes</A></I></P><P>Exxon Mobil Corp., <mark>BP PLC</mark>, and Chevron Corp. are some of the oil, coal and gas companies
   that face a new wave of <mark>climate change</mark> litigation. These latest cases are by California
   cities and counties alleging the energy producers’ emissions amount to public nuisances
   under state law.
</P><P>The suits, filed by 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/uP1"">Marin</A> and 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/uP3"">San Mateo</A> counties and the cities of 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/t3h"">San Francisco</A>, 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/t3i"">Oakland</A> and 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/uP2"">Imperial Beach</A>, are expected to be the first of many, as public officials in other states increasingly
   look to the courts, not the federal government, to protect their communities from
   sea level rise, attorneys told Bloomberg Law.
</P><P>Some legal experts said this latest set of suits, sparked in large part by the Trump
   administration’s reversal of <mark>climate change</mark> initiatives, have their basis in state
   law similar to nuisance claims recently upheld in high-profile lead paint litigation.
   
</P><P>The suits’ state-law grounding, they said, makes them significantly different from
   federal <mark>climate change</mark> litigation rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court several years
   ago.
</P><P>Proponents also said advancements in the ability to trace <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and other
   pollutants to a relatively small group of companies could bolster the claims.
</P><P>“We are at the dawn of what is a massive wave of litigation,” said 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://www.ciel.org/about-us/ciel-staff/carroll-muffett-president-and-ceo/"">Carroll Muffett</A>, president and CEO of the Center for International Environmental Law, an environmental
   advocacy organization in Washington. “While it began in California, I don’t think
   it’s going to end there,” he said. 
</P><P>But defense attorneys, while acknowledging that more suits are in the offing, remain
   generally skeptical of the odds of any of the litigation gaining much traction. 
</P><P>The new public nuisance suits amount to “lawless exercises in standardless liability
   that lie beyond the power of courts to adjudicate,” said 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""https://www.dwt.com/people/richardfaulk/""> Richard Faulk</A> with Davis Wright Tremaine
   LLP in Washington. Many courts “have already condemned” such efforts, he said. 
</P><H5>`Wave of the Future’</H5><P><mark>Climate change</mark> public nuisance suits are “the wave of the future,” Professor 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://columbia<mark>climate</mark>law.com/about-us/our-team/michael-burger/"">Michael Burger</A>, executive director of the Sabin Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Law at Columbia Law School
   in New York, told Bloomberg Law.
</P><P>While the companies could be found liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages
   in the California suits, “it’s unlikely that would make a dent in their pocketbooks,”
   Burger said. 
</P><P>More litigation will be required “to put real pressure on industry to get behind significant
   greenhouse gas regulation,” he said. “That doesn’t happen if there are only suits
   in one state.” 
</P><P><A class=""bluenobold"" href=""https://delawarelaw.widener.edu/current-students/faculty-directory/faculty/122""> James May</A>, a professor at Widener University Delaware Law School in Wilmington, Del., agreed
   that the California suits are only the beginning. “I would anticipate there will be filings in other states, regardless of what happens
   in the California cases,” May, who’s co-director of Widener’s Environmental Rights
   Institute, said. 
</P><P>May said he would look to states that have shown an interest in addressing <mark>climate</mark>
   change, including New York, Maine, Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington, as likely
   locations for upcoming litigation. 
</P><P>“The potential significance of these cases is huge,” May said “It sounds dramatic,
   but the world is watching.” 
</P><P>San Francisco and Oakland, represented by Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP in Seattle,
   Berkeley, Calif., and Newton Centre, Mass., filed their suits in September.
</P><P>Those suits came on the heels of the San Mateo, Marin and Imperial Beach claims filed
   in July by Sher Edling LLP in San Francisco. 
</P><H5>Trump Effect</H5><P>The latest suits are driven by a number of factors, including the Trump administration’s
   retreat from efforts to combat <mark>climate change</mark> such as withdrawal from the Paris accord,
   a premise even some defense attorneys agree with. 
</P><P>“We have a tone deaf administration that rejects <mark>climate change</mark>,” defense attorney
   William Ruskin with the Law Office of 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""https://wruskinlaw.com"">William A. Ruskin</A>, PLLC in Rye Brook, N.Y., told Bloomberg Law. “In frustration, people are turning
   to the courts.” 
</P><P>Burger agreed that the political <mark>climate</mark> is a factor driving the litigation. </P><P>“The obvious answer is the election of Trump ground <mark>climate change</mark> action to a halt,”
   Burger said. 
</P><P>“We are seeing the federal government abdicate its responsibility,” he said. “When
   there’s a large regulatory gap, one way to fill it is through litigation.” 
</P><P> May said the failure to address <mark>climate change</mark> in the U.S. outside of the courtroom
   leaves few alternatives to litigation. 
</P><P>“The politically blue states have taken action, but that can only go so far,” May
   said.
</P><P>“Historically, the common law provides a cause of action to get into court.” </P><H5>‘It’s Not Going Away’</H5><P>But defense counsel are critical of the public nuisance suits, which they say unfairly
   target companies for engaging in legal activity. 
</P><P>“To make a handful of companies responsible for billions in damages for <mark>climate change</mark>
   is inherently lawless and unprincipled,” Ruskin said. 
</P><P>Ruskin defends industrial companies and manufacturers in products liability, toxic
   tort, and environmental actions.
</P><P>The suits, he said, “respond to a failure of government to address <mark>climate change</mark>.”
   
</P><P>“But as extreme as Trump is to the right, it’s an equally disturbing result on the
   other end of the spectrum,” he said. “There’s a big social problem, and a lack of
   funds to address it so we turn to people whose product was perfectly legal.”
</P><P>Ruskin, too, predicts more such suits in other states. </P><P>“Of course there will be copycat cases. If a city attorney or AG is running for election,
   these are popular cases,” he said. 
</P><P>“The plaintiffs’ bar will keep hammering,” he said. “It’s not going to go away.” </P><P>Ruskin said, however, the plaintiffs’ assertions that they can quantify the <mark>carbon</mark>
   dioxide and methane emissions attributable to each defendant “is a lot of smoke and
   mirrors.”
</P><P>“It’s like claiming if you have a million dairy cows, each of which emits methane,
   you can somehow determine how much any one cow’s methane releases contribute to <mark>climate</mark>
   change,” he said. “It just cannot be done. It’s junk science.”
</P><P>Ruskin also said he expects courts to look at the claims skeptically because both
   the U.S. Supreme Court, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, found
   federal common law nuisance claims barred under the Clean Air Act in 
   <I><A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Am_Electric_Power_Co_v_Connecticut_564_US_410_131_S_Ct_2527_180_L?doc_id=X1FJHB2003?jcsearch=+131+supreme+court+2527"">Am. Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut</A></I>, 564 U.S. 410 (2011) and

   </I>. 
</P><P>But, he acknowledged, “who knows how a state court in California is going to look
   at this?”
</P><H5>Distinguishing the Federal Rulings</H5><P>Professor May certainly sees some advantages for plaintiffs in having the first set
   of suits proceeding in the Golden State. 
</P><P>“The common law is a little more generous” in California than in other states, he
   said, including a more lenient statute of limitations and a higher bar to preemption.
   
</P><P>A California appeals court recently 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/uec"">upheld</A>, but trimmed, a high-profile lead paint public nuisance ruling against Sherwin-Williams,
   NL Industries and ConAgra Grocery Products. 
</P><P>The court affirmed liability findings in the case, but sent the suit back to a trial
   court to recalculate the $1.15 billion judgment against the companies.
</P><P>May also said that if the <mark>climate change</mark> nuisance cases end up being moved to federal
   court, the Ninth Circuit, despite the 
   <I>Kivalina</I> ruling, is overall a good circuit for a plaintiff to be in.
</P><P>And there’s the simple fact that California is a major greenhouse gas producer, he
   said. 
</P><P>Professor Burger, at Columbia Law School, said both 
   <I>AEP</I> and 
   <I>Kivalina</I> are distinguishable from the California cases. 
</P><P>“The analysis for whether federal legislation displaces a federal common law claim
   is different than the analysis for whether federal legislation preempts state law,”
   he said. 
</P><P>“State nuisance claims for air <mark>pollution</mark> have been found to not be preempted in several
   important cases,” Burger said. “And there is nothing in the Clean Air Act to indicate
   that Congress expressly or implicitly intended to preempt state common law claims
   based on harms from <mark>climate change</mark>.”
</P><P>But other federal appeals courts have found the opposite, including in

</P><H5>New Science </H5><P><A class=""bluenobold"" href=""https://www.sheredling.com/team/vic-sher/"">Vic Sher</A>, attorney for the Marin, Imperial Beach and San Mateo plaintiffs, cites scientific
   advances, and new media reporting showing industry culpability, as other factors supporting
   the new set of <mark>climate change</mark> suits.
</P><P>“In terms of science, there have been developments showing links between emissions
   and impacts and the attribution of them to particular corporate actions,” Sher said.
   “And investigative reporting shows what they did and didn’t do.” 
</P><P>Muffett, of the Center for International Environmental Law, said it is now possible
   to “to quantify contributions of individual corporate actors to <mark>carbon</mark> in the atmosphere.”
   
</P><P>“Two-thirds of all industrial emissions of C02 and methane since the industrial revolution
   can be traced to 90 entities,” Muffett said, citing a 2013 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/uWZ"">study</A> by Richard Heede, co-founder of the <mark>Climate</mark> Accountability Institute in Snowmass,
   Colo. 
</P><P>“Courts aren’t comfortable dealing with a million defendants. But they are comfortable
   dealing with 50,” he said. “Once we get to a constrained universe of defendants, the
   landscape changes completely.” 
</P><P>But Burger of Columbia Law School said it remains to be seen whether the alleged link
   between <mark>climate change</mark> and energy emissions will be sufficient to establish liability
   under state nuisance law.
</P><P>“There is no single, established methodology for attributing greenhouse gas emissions
   to fossil fuel companies based on the eventual combustion of the products they put
   into the market,” Burger said. 
</P><P>“Plaintiffs in the California cases have offered one method. Defendants will undoubtedly
   challenge it in numerous ways—from the technical details to the central assumptions,”
   he said. 
</P><P>“But courts are well equipped to figure out how responsibility should be apportioned
   among different actors with different types and degrees of responsibility,” Burger
   said.
</P><H5><B>Other Claims </B></H5><P>As the public nuisance cases make their way through the courts, they are not the only
   suits pending against energy companies and other defendants over <mark>climate change</mark>. 
</P><P>The Ninth Circuit heard oral arguments Dec. 11 in a 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://src.bna.com/uIA"">suit</A> brought by children who allege the federal government has violated their constitutional
   right to a livable <mark>climate</mark> by failing to reduce greenhouse gases.
</P><P>And, in November, a German court ruled that a Peruvian farmer may proceed with his
   claims that German energy utility RWE’s emissions have caused glacier melt in his
   home town. 
</P><P>The RWE case is an “important development,” Burger said. “It’s similar to the public
   nuisance cases, and further along than any of these cases have gotten in the US,”
   he said.

Parker announced today that they had filed separate lawsuits on behalf of their respective cities against the five largest investor-owned producers of fossil fuels in the world. The lawsuits ask the courts to hold these companies responsible for the costs of sea walls and other infrastructure necessary to protect San Francisco and Oakland from ongoing and future consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> and sea level rise caused by the companies’ production of massive amounts of fossil fuels.</P><P>The defendant companies — Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil, BP and Royal Dutch Shell — have known for decades that fossil fuel-driven global warming and accelerated sea level rise posed a catastrophic risk to human beings and to public and private property, especially in coastal cities like San Francisco and Oakland, who have the largest shoreline investments on San Francisco Bay.</P><P>Despite that knowledge, the defendant companies continued to aggressively produce, market and sell vast quantities of fossil fuels for a global market, while at the same time engaging in an organized campaign to deceive consumers about the dangers of massive fossil fuel production.</P><P>The lawsuits filed Tuesday in the superior courts in San Francisco and Alameda Counties were developed with assistance from the law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP.</P><P>Like the tobacco companies who were sued in the 1980s, these defendants knowingly and recklessly created an ongoing public nuisance that is causing harm now, and in the future risks catastrophic harm to human life and property, including billions of dollars of public and private property in Oakland and San Francisco.</P><P>“These fossil fuel companies profited handsomely for decades while knowing they were putting the fate of our cities at risk,” San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said. “Instead of owning up to it, they copied a page from the Big Tobacco playbook. They launched a multi-million dollar disinformation campaign to deny and discredit what was clear even to their own scientists: global warming is real, and their product is a huge part of the problem. Now, the bill has come due. It’s time for these companies to take responsibility for the harms they have caused and are continuing to cause.”</P><P>“Global warming is an existential threat to humankind, to our ecosystems and to the wondrous, myriad species that inhabit our planet,” Oakland City Attorney Barbara J. Parker said. “These companies knew fossil fuel-driven <mark>climate change</mark> was real, they knew it was caused by their products and they lied to cover up that knowledge to protect their astronomical profits. The harm to our cities has commenced and will only get worse. The law is clear that the defendants are responsible for the consequences of their reckless and disastrous actions.”</P><P>The fossil fuel industry’s own records show that the defendant companies have knowingly misled the American public and the world about the dangers of fossil-fuel driven <mark>climate change</mark>. For example, in 1968, a scientific consultant working for the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association representing fossil fuel companies, warned that <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions were “almost certain” to produce significant temperature increases and a rise in sea levels. In 1980, API and its member companies learned that “likely impacts” of global warming would include “globally catastrophic effects.”</P><P>Despite their knowledge of the scientific consensus on these issues, and despite warnings from their own internal scientists and/or scientists retained by their trade association, defendants continue to engage in massive fossil fuel production. They also continue to promote fossil fuels, and have developed multi-decade future business plans based upon increased fossil fuel usage even as global warming has progressed into a severe danger zone.</P><P>Defendants’ contributions to global warming have already caused sea levels to rise in San Francisco Bay and threatened imminent harm to San Francisco and Oakland from storm surges. Sea levels will continue rising in the Bay due to defendants’ past, present and ongoing conduct, and this ongoing conduct exacerbates a problem that is largely irreversible. A recent state report, <A href=""http://www.opc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/docs/rising-seas-in-california-an-update-on-sea-level-rise-science.pdf"">Rising Seas in California</A>, projects as much as 10 feet of additional sea level rise along San Francisco’s coastline by 2100, which would be catastrophic. </P><P>In Oakland and San Francisco, property worth billions of dollars is located six feet or less above current sea levels.  In San Francisco, bayside sea level rise from global warming places at risk at least $10 billion of public property and as much as $39 billion of private property.</P><P>San Francisco has already taken a number of steps to start addressing the problem. Those include creating a Sea Level Rise Action Plan, a precursor to implementing a long-term infrastructure plan necessary to protect our city against rising water levels. San Francisco has also integrated sea level rise guidance into our long-term city capital plan.</P><P>“San Francisco has been a leader on many levels when it comes to addressing sea level rise,” Herrera said. “Now we’re going to ensure that those responsible for the problem are held to account.”</P><P>Sea level rise, storm surges and flooding threaten not only physical infrastructure but the safety, lives, daily way of life, sense of community, and security of Oakland and San Francisco residents.</P><P>San Francisco is also extremely vulnerable to accelerated sea level rise and storm surges because it is surrounded by water on three sides. Sea level rise will disproportionately impact some of San Francisco’s most vulnerable residents, including those in the Bayview/Hunters Point neighborhood. It also threatens some of San Francisco’s most iconic and valuable buildings.  For example, the Ferry Building would be temporarily flooded during a 100-year extreme tide today, but could be flooded every day after 36 inches of sea level rise.</P><P>A significant portion of the combined sewer and storm water infrastructure on the west side of San Francisco is at severe risk of shoreline erosion caused by sea level rise.  As a result, San Francisco has developed plans to protect that infrastructure at an initial estimated cost of $350 million. Shoreline erosion along Ocean Beach also threatens roads, pathways, private properties, and buildings along the shore.</P><P>In Oakland, these disastrous consequences will disproportionately impact and endanger the lives and property of African American, Hispanic and other people of color as well as low income populations who reside in West Oakland and the flatlands of East Oakland.</P><P>The 2014 National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment, produced by over 300 experts and the National Academy of Sciences, specifically identified Oakland’s airport as threatened by sea level rise. The Oakland airport is more than a foot lower than New York-LaGuardia, which was flooded during Hurricane Sandy. Sea level rise and related flooding also imminently threaten Oakland’s sewer system.  Rising sea levels imminently threaten to prevent water from discharging properly from the sewer system, which will cause sewage to back up and flood certain sections of the city.</P><P>San Francisco and Oakland already have begun to suffer the consequences of <mark>climate change</mark>, although the most severe injuries by far are the injuries that will occur in the future — unless prompt action is taken to protect these cities and their residents from rising sea levels and other harms caused by global warming. <mark>Climate change</mark> models show large parts of San Francisco and Oakland, including the Oakland airport, under water within 100 years during storm surges.</P><P>The lawsuits ask the courts to hold the defendants jointly and severally liable for creating, contributing to and/or maintaining a public nuisance, and to create an abatement fund for each city to be paid for by defendants to fund infrastructure projects necessary for San Francisco and Oakland to adapt to global warming and sea level rise. The total amount needed for the abatement funds is not known at this time but is expected to be in the billions of dollars.</P><P>The cases are: <EM>People of the State of California v.

The concept, first floated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator back in mid-2017, was to hold a series of debates billed as a constructive dialogue between parties with markedly differing views. Many people, however, suspected it was little more than an ideology-laundering scheme: a means of legitimizing dirty, industry-generated <mark>climate</mark> denial and introducing it into the marketplace of ideas as clean, honest dissent.</P><P>Pruitt’s plan made headlines when it was announced, but then it just sort of disappeared. Last week we learned why: White House Chief of Staff John Kelly <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/<mark>climate</mark>/pruitt-red-team-<mark>climate</mark>-debate-kelly.html"">killed it</A>. According to reports, Kelly saw the idea as “ill-conceived and politically risky” and made it clear to Pruitt by November that the debates simply wouldn’t be happening. Since then there’s been no more talk of them. (Or maybe Pruitt has just been muttering to himself about them from within his <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/03/14/scott-pruitts-25000-soundproof-phone-booth-it-actually-cost-more-like-43000/?utm_term=.d526bbf1bdcf"">much-more-expensive-than-previously-reported</A> “cone of silence.”)</P><P>But if Pruitt’s not doing anything next Wednesday, he should catch a plane to San Francisco—coach, please!—and visit the federal courthouse. There, for one day only, U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup will be presiding over a debate not unlike the one of the EPA administrator’s fantasies. As part of official proceedings in <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>casechart.com/case/people-state-california-v-bp-plc-oakland/""><EM>People of the State of California v. BP P.L.C.</EM></A>, a lawsuit brought by the cities of Oakland and San Francisco against BP and other oil companies, plaintiffs and defendants have been asked to organize a <A href=""http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article203842084.html""><mark>climate change</mark> tutorial</A> for the benefit of the court, in the form of a five-hour presentation of the issues from their respective vantage points.</P><P>Judge Alsup’s order reads like the instructions for a college essay contest. The first part of the presentation, he writes, “will trace the history of scientific study of <mark>climate change</mark>, beginning with scientific inquiry into the formation and melting of the ice ages, periods of historical cooling and warming, smog, ozone, nuclear winter, volcanoes, and global warming.” The second part “will set forth the best science now available on global warming, glacier melt, sea rise, and coastal flooding.”</P><P>To help the adversaries structure their arguments, the judge has helpfully submitted <A href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180306_docket-317-cv-06011_order.pdf"">a list of nine questions</A>. The two shortest and simplest are also the most provocative: “What are the main sources of CO<SUB>2</SUB> that account for the incremental buildup of CO<SUB>2</SUB> in the atmosphere?” and “What are the main sources of heat that account for the incremental rise in temperature on earth?”</P><P>People are already referring to the faceoff in Judge Alsup’s courtroom as the <A href=""https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/3/9/1747714/-California-Court-to-See-Scopes-ish-Trial-for-<mark>Climate</mark>-Change"">Scopes “Monkey Trial” for <mark>climate change</mark></A>. But there’s a big difference between this court proceeding and the one from 1925 that put the theory of evolution on trial and helped determine the future of science education in the United States. In the Scopes proceeding, one side genuinely believed in the scientific basis for Darwin’s theory, and the other side didn’t. While many Americans refuse to accept the science supporting <mark>climate change</mark>, BP and its oil-company codefendants in this case aren’t expected to deny the underlying scientific facts.</P><DIV><DIV class=""action-promo-wrap""><DIV class=""l-1up-promo clearfix""><DIV class=""oneup-promo-text-wrap eq-col""><DIV class=""oneup-promo-text""><H2>Stand up to Trump’s <mark>climate</mark>-denial agenda  </H2><DIV class=""button-style-involved""><H3 class=""action-link""><A href=""https://act.nrdc.org/letter/oppose-<mark>climate</mark>-denial-agenda-170913?source=WBSCACPET"">Take Action</A></H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Instead, they will likely deny <EM>complicity</EM> in any scheme to cover up their role in perpetuating global warming and its many deleterious consequences. And in that difference is a sign that those of us who accept the reality of <mark>climate change</mark> are winning the larger cultural debate. Oil companies can and do get away with a lot of bad stuff. But one thing they know they can’t get away with is openly refuting <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/stories/global-warming-101"">the science</A> showing that emissions from fossil fuels are leading to a warmer planet, and thus to extreme weather events, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and more. To do so would be to place themselves so far outside of the mainstream scientific consensus that they couldn’t be taken seriously anymore.</P><P>Oil companies today are actually in a position not unlike that of tobacco companies in the 1980s, when they began adopting a legal defense very different from the one they had used in decades past. No longer did they try to maintain that smoking didn’t cause lung cancer. Everybody knew by that point that smoking caused lung cancer. Instead, they tried to argue that (1) you couldn’t <EM>prove</EM> that someone’s lung cancer came from smoking rather than some other source, and (2) that smokers had assumed the risk of cancer when they decided to take up the habit.</P><P>Brazenly blaming the victim may have achieved <A href=""https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tobacco-litigation-history-and-development-32202.html"">mixed results </A>as a legal defense strategy, but it did very little to make smoking seem safe—or to make tobacco companies seem sympathetic. As a result, smoking began to gradually lose its social license: By 2015, the percentage of adult American smokers had <A href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-smoking-rate-does-something-it-hasnt-in-years/"">dropped to 15 percent</A> from a high of 42 percent in 1965.</P><P>Even if they don’t bother to refute the (<A href=""https://<mark>climate</mark>.nasa.gov/evidence/"">irrefutable</A>) data on emissions and <mark>climate change</mark>, it will nevertheless be fascinating to see what kind of presentation the defense puts on in Judge Alsup’s courtroom. There’s really no way for oil companies to come out of this thing looking good. If they acknowledge that the science is real, they lend support to the plaintiffs’ argument that oil companies have known all along that their activity contributes to <mark>climate change</mark> but have continued to engage in it anyway. On the other hand, if their spokespeople try to cast doubt on the science in any way, they risk looking like fools, or knaves, or both.</P><P><mark>Climate</mark> deniers are fond of saying that “the jury’s still out” when it comes to the science behind global warming. That’s not true. Still, if the deniers want their day in court, they’re about to get one. But a word to BP and its codefendants: Please be reminded that you are under oath.</P><P><EM>onEarth provides reporting and analysis about environmental science, policy, and culture.

Written by Monckton, Soon, Legates, Briggs, Limburg, Jeschke, Henney, Whitfield, and Morrison. Attorneys: Braden and Ferrara.</P></DIV><DIV class=""info""><DIV class=""full-story""><P><STRONG>INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Methods:</STRONG> The <EM>amici curiae</EM> present herein two scientific results not mentioned in the parties’ briefs but directly and decisively relevant to the determination not only of these but of all suchlike proceedings. The first result has been peer-reviewed and published; the second is currently under peer review. The underlying science is simple enough to allow the Court, which has earned a unique and commendable reputation for diligent mastery of scientific questions, to understand the argument and to verify its soundness. To assist the Court and to vitiate any allegation of prejudice on the part of its <EM>amici</EM>, they will state explicitly whether each premise is regarded as mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science, in which event they will provide mainstream citations from peer-reviewed learned journals.</P><P><STRONG>First result:</STRONG> The <EM>amici curiae</EM> will demonstrate that there is no “consensus” among scientists that recent global warming was chiefly anthropogenic, still less that unmitigated anthropogenic warming has been or will be dangerous or catastrophic. The “consensus” proposition, as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC), states no more than that most of the global warming observed since 1950 was anthropogenic. That proposition does not necessarily entail the conclusion that global warming has been or will be net-harmful. In 2013, a paper was published falsely asserting that some 97.1% of 11,944 peer-reviewed papers on <mark>climate</mark> and related topics published in the learned journals during the 21 years 1991-2011 had explicitly stated in their abstracts that recent global warming was chiefly anthropogenic. That paper received worldwide publicity.</P><P>However, its authors did not ask whether the 11,944 papers had stated that unmitigated global warming might prove catastrophic. It will be shown that on careful examination of the list of all 11,944 papers only 43, or 0.3%, had in reality stated their assent even to the anodyne proposition that recent warming was chiefly anthropogenic. In any event, argument from “consensus” is a logical fallacy. Thus, there is no agreement among relevant experts on the fraction of observed warming since 1950 that was anthropogenic, and, therefore, no such agreement on the answer to the Court’s eighth question.</P><P><STRONG>Second result:</STRONG> The <EM>amici curiae</EM> will demonstrate that, even if it be assumed <EM>ad argumentum</EM> that all of the 0.8 Kelvin global warming since anthropogenic influence first became potentially significant in 1950 was attributable to us, in the present century little more than 1.2 K of global warming is to be expected, not the 3.3 K that the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) had predicted.</P><P>It will be demonstrated that the current models greatly overstate the feedback response to direct warming, owing to a long-standing error of physics recently discovered by the <EM>amici curiae</EM>, the decades-old official predictions that upon the restoration of thermal equilibrium in the <mark>climate</mark> system following a doubling of the atmospheric concentration of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide there will have occurred a global surface warming of 3.3 ± 1.2 K, are excessive. Accordingly, the extreme predictions of 4.5 K to 11 K on which national and international policies and plaintiff’s case have been predicated are excessive a fortiori; global warming will be small, slow and net-beneficial; and plaintiff’s case must fall.</P><P><STRONG>Verification:</STRONG> By several methods whose results cohere, the <EM>amici curiae</EM> determined and verified that the mid-range estimate of global warming per doubling of atmospheric <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (approximately equivalent to expected 21st-century warming from all anthropogenic sources) will not be 3.3 ± 1.2 K but only 1.2 ± 0.15 K If these results be correct, concern about global warming is unnecessary, whereupon not only must plaintiff’s case fail but defendants’ public assertions that global warming is a serious problem are also unjustifiable.</P><P><STRONG>Respectful submission:</STRONG> The <EM>amici curiae</EM>, therefore, respectfully submit that, in the light of these results, which are directly relevant to the issue before the Court, plaintiff’s claims should be dismissed and defendants, having based their public expressions of concern about global warming on the same error as plaintiff, should meet their own costs in the cause.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""details""><DIV class=""tags""><DIV class=""title"">Article Tags</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Plaintiffs claimed these actions created a public nuisance and sought both injunctive relief and damages.</P><P><STRONG>Looking Ahead</STRONG>: There is now a lack of consensus as to whether these global warming cases should be in federal or state court.</P><P>In direct contradiction to the court's opinion in <EM>The People of the State of California v. BP P.L.C.</EM> a month earlier, a different court in the Northern District of California remanded three &quot;global warming&quot; actions back to California state court. <EM>County of San Mateo v. Chevron Corp.</EM>, <EM>City of Imperial Beach v. Chevron Corp.</EM>, <EM>County of Marin v. Chevron Corp</EM>.</P><P>The County of San Mateo, the County of Marin, and the City of Imperial Beach filed suits in California state court against many of the top producers and sellers of fossil fuels worldwide claiming that the defendants knew that emissions from the fuels they produced and marketed created greenhouse gas <mark>pollution</mark> that has caused and will cause serious environmental impacts on the people of California, including flooding events and severe storms. Plaintiffs in these suits brought causes of action for public nuisance and strict liability. The defendants removed the cases to federal court.</P><P>In its remand opinion, the court granted the plaintiffs' motions to remand the proceedings back to state court because it found that removal based on the application of federal common law was not warranted. This court disagreed with the court in <EM>The People of the State of California v. BP P.L.C.</EM> and found that the Ninth Circuit decision in <EM>Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp.</EM> was directly applicable to the case. The court noted significant similarities between <EM>Kivalina</EM> and the instant matter, including the types of claims brought, types of damages sought, and the defendants named.</P><P>Based on these similarities, the court interpreted <EM>Kivalina</EM> to stand for the proposition that the federal common law is displaced by the federal Clean Air Act for both global warming related claims against direct emitters and energy producers. As a result, the court held that the plaintiffs' claims were not governed by federal common law and that federal common law did not preclude plaintiffs from asserting their state law claims.</P><P>The court then held that removal was also not warranted because: (i) the state claims were not completely preempted by any federal law; (ii) there was no actual, disputed, substantial federal issue requiring <EM>Grable</EM> jurisdiction; and (iii) no specialized statutory removal provision was applicable.</P><P>After determining that removal was not appropriate, the court stayed the matter for 42 days to allow the parties to consider whether the matter should be certified for interlocutory appeal or whether the remand order should be stayed pending appeal of the earlier remand order. The court requested a briefing schedule from the parties within seven days of the ruling.</P><P>The result of this ruling is that there is now no consensus, at least within the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as to whether these suits brought by cities and counties in California against fossil fuel producers for global warming impacts should be in federal or state court. There are now rulings on each side of the issue that could be used by defendants and plaintiffs in other similar suits.</P><P><STRONG>Key Takeaway</STRONG></P><OL><LI>There is no consensus, at least within the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as to whether suits brought by cities and counties in California against fossil fuel producers for global warming impacts should be in federal or state court.</LI></OL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The defendants — BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, and ConocoPhillips — sent one lawyer, from Chevron. And when it was his turn to present, the Chevron attorney agreed that human activity is changing the <mark>climate</mark> and that it warrants action.</P><P id=""lvwhiV"">This is a seismic shift from years past, when “<A href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/publications/catalyst/su15-documenting-fossil-fuel-companies-<mark>climate</mark>-deception"">uncertainties</A>” about <mark>climate change</mark> were the party line for oil companies.

And what we learned from the tutorial is that these companies are likely to use the agreed-upon science to make the case that they shouldn’t have to pay for the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P id=""JNGS92"">If the cities’ lawsuit survives a barrage of motions to dismiss, they will still have to show that oil majors deliberately sowed confusion on <mark>climate change</mark> in bad faith.Let’s walk through what we know about the various arguments so far. </P><H3 id=""9FFvBv"">Oil companies agree on the science but not the politics</H3><P id=""AWIkgM"">The fundamental argument from the oil companies is that <mark>climate change</mark> is a global problem that needs a political solution, and you can’t solve a political problem in court and you certainly can’t blame the oil companies for selling a product that everyone wants to buy. </P><P id=""BDk4p1"">Theodore Boutrous, a <A href=""https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/boutrous-jr-theodore-j/"">seasoned litigator</A> who’s argued cases before the US Supreme Court, presented on behalf of Chevron. “Chevron accepts the consensus in the scientific communities on <mark>climate change</mark>,” he said last week. “There’s no debate about <mark>climate</mark> science.”</P><P id=""hZydq0"">He built his presentation around the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>’s <A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/"">fifth assessment report</A>, published in 2013, which has more than 800 authors and cites more than 9,200 scientific papers (he also rewatched <A href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/""><EM>An Inconvenient Truth</EM></A>). The report states that the IPCC is “95 percent certain that humans are the main cause of current global warming” and remains one of the most robust works in <mark>climate</mark> science. </P><P id=""VqGdix"">But as Boutrous detailed the history of how <mark>climate</mark> scientists like Svante Arrhenius and John Tyndall developed their theories, he also noted that previous IPCC reports weren’t always so certain. The 1990 report said that “the observed increase could be largely due to natural variability.” The 1995 report said that signals were emerging that there is human influence on the <mark>climate</mark>. The 2001 report said that warming was “very unlikely” due to natural causes alone. </P><P id=""biLlp4"">The point he was making was that the consensus took time to build, and as the science got better, Chevron moved with it. Past rhetoric from oil companies reflected this uncertainty in the science, and Chevron now has a <A href=""https://www.chevron.com/corporate-responsibility/<mark>climate</mark>-change"">comprehensive strategy</A> for managing <mark>climate</mark> risks, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions. </P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>Chevron’s El Segundo Refinery covers approximately 1,000 acres with more than 1,100 miles of pipelines and is capable of refining nearly 270,000 barrels of crude oil per day.</FIGCAPTION><CITE>David McNew/Getty Images</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""H1Zi51"">Another key point Boutrous made was that these human-sourced greenhouse gas emissions are due to growing wealth and development, of which fossil fuel combustion is a symptom, not a cause. “Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever,” the IPCC reported in <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/news_and_events/docs/ar5/ar5_syr_headlines_en.pdf"">2014</A>. </P><P id=""X2JhZ3"">“It’s just a facet of human existence,” Boutrous told Vox. “It’s an issue for policymakers to address.”</P><P id=""Hx9n7I"">And looking toward the future, it’s unclear how <mark>climate change</mark> will impact San Francisco and Oakland in particular. San Francisco, in its complaint, included a map showing water inundation for the city with 66 inches of sea level rise plus 42 inches of flooding from a <A href=""https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/28/16211392/100-500-year-flood-meaning"">100-year storm</A>, a scenario they called “unlikely, but possible.”</P><P id=""XkjoUu"">Boutrous pointed out that while global sea levels are rising on average, some evidence shows that sea levels have fallen in specific regions, and coastal flooding in places like the San Francisco Bay Area is also a function of local conditions like <A href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180307141411.htm"">land subsidence</A>. </P><P id=""6ChfQj"">So for San Francisco and Oakland to build a claim on harms from future sea level rise is a stretch when there is so much uncertainty as to what will happen, the argument goes.</P><P id=""ke9AHk"">Boutrous noted that when the judge asked the scientists in the room if they disagreed with what he presented, they didn’t question his reading of the facts. </P><P id=""JqqmAq"">That signals that progress in these lawsuits isn’t going to hinge on the science so much as an untested legal theory, and that’s where the plaintiffs are on weak footing, according to Boutrous. Holding oil companies liable for producing fossil fuels would also open up cities to liability for building roads and facilitating travel with vehicles that burn those fuels. </P><P id=""0SeikJ"">“Focusing resources on a novel, never-accepted theory just isn’t the way to have a productive chance at really addressing global warming,” Boutrous said. “No tort theory has ever been developed that comes close to covering these issues.” </P><H3 id=""1FjVuh"">The <mark>climate</mark> models have gotten better; the news has gotten worse </H3><P id=""x1ezhd"">But Donald Wuebbles, an author of the 2013 IPCC report as well as the 2017 <A href=""https://science2017.globalchange.gov/"">National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment</A> produced by 13 US federal agencies, noted that while the last IPCC report may be the biggest work in <mark>climate</mark> science, it only incorporated research published as of 2012. </P><P id=""FQVBDN"">“I started up my talk saying that the science didn’t stop in 2012,” Wuebbles, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois, told Vox. “The reality is these assessments are very conservative in their statements.”</P><P id=""bLVr1X"">His end of the tutorial focused on the changes we can anticipate as average temperatures go up around the world, noting that models have become more robust and that scientists are zeroing in on the harms that will be caused by unmitigated changes to the global <mark>climate</mark>. Judge Alsup also asked him about policy questions like which energy sources the United States can use if it gives up coal, oil, and natural gas.</P><P id=""RZz3ub"">The other four defendants had representatives in the room but declined to present, which San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera read as a signal that the other oil companies did not even want to recognize that the court has jurisdiction in such a case. </P><P id=""WstLvp"">But Alsup didn’t let the other oil companies off the hook, as Debra Kahn of <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/2018/03/22/stories/1060077139"">E&amp;E News</A> noted:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P id=""ak4Jix"">Alsup ordered the other defendants in the suit — <mark>BP PLC</mark>, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, all of which had representatives at the hearing — to submit briefs within two weeks detailing any points of disagreement with Chevron. “Otherwise, I’m going to assume you’re in agreement,” he said. “You can’t get away with sitting there in silence and then later say, ‘He wasn’t speaking for us.’”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P id=""BtoyKV"">For its part, San Francisco counted the tutorial as a win.</P><P id=""ZOYPmx"">“What we saw today was one oil company begrudgingly accept the scientific consensus while trying to overemphasize the extent of scientific uncertainty,” Herrera said in a statement. “It’s time for them to pay for the seawalls and other infrastructure needed to protect San Francisco and Oakland.”</P><P id=""57ak9s"">The legal maneuvering in this case will continue, and the litigation will likely take <A href=""https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Should-oil-companies-pay-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change-Yes-12768553.php"">years</A> to resolve. Yet the fact that the lawsuits were allowed to proceed this far and that the judge has cemented the science in the courtroom means that the foundation for <mark>climate change</mark> litigation is the strongest it’s ever been. The question for the court is whether it’s strong enough to bill an oil company for a levee.</P><P id=""UOaJ2N"">UCLA’s Carlson said that the defendants will continue to file motions to dismiss the case citing different arguments — that the court doesn’t have jurisdiction in such a case, for instance, or that the defendants don’t have standing, or that federal law doesn’t provide any recourse in such a lawsuit. If none of those motions finds traction in the court, then four to six months from now, the cases move to the discovery phase, where the defendants will have to start producing documents and providing evidence. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Chevron Corp., et al.</EM>, No. 17CIV03222, 2017 WL 3048970 (Cal. Super. Ct. filed July 17, 2017) (&quot;<EM>San Mateo</EM>&quot;). The plaintiffs in these lawsuits sued a number of major energy companies (36 in total) that were allegedly responsible for roughly 20% of global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions since the 1960s. Like the <EM>Oakland</EM> and <EM>San Francisco</EM> complaints, the <EM>San Mateo</EM> complaints allege that the fossil fuel company defendants funded scientific studies and public relations campaigns to create uncertainty about the existence, causes and risks of <mark>climate change</mark> – despite the defendants' own internal understanding and acknowledgement of <mark>climate change</mark> and the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> from <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from fossil fuels. The <EM>San Mateo </EM>complaints seek damages for the historical and prospective damage that <mark>climate change</mark> allegedly has caused in these coastal California communities.</P><H3>A growing trend</H3><P>These complaints are part of a growing trend by plaintiffs' lawyers and environmental activists to turn to the judiciary in certain states, like California, with a strong political commitment to addressing the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on the environment. In addition to this spate of recent lawsuits filed by various California cities and municipalities, attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts have issued wide-ranging investigatory subpoenas upon ExxonMobil. These subpoenas seek documents related to Exxon's internal understanding of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and <mark>climate change</mark>, and any alleged efforts Exxon took to promote contradictory studies and information with the purpose of misleading the public.</P><P>One common thread to the various <mark>climate change</mark> investigations and litigations over the last few years is that they are being pursued in &quot;blue states&quot; such as California, New York and Massachusetts, at the same time that President Trump and the Republican controlled Congress have taken, or explored taking, various steps to roll-back <mark>climate change</mark> initiatives championed by the Obama Administration. These federal rollbacks include President Trump's stated intention to withdraw US participation from the Paris Agreement, the current EPA decision to review (and possibly scale back) the enforcement of the Clean Air Act as it relates to certain <mark>climate change</mark> issues, and a general lack of enthusiasm by federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, to pursue litigation or more aggressive regulation relating to the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><H3>Will these recent California tort claims succeed or fail?</H3><P>In our view, they will fail and fail early on at the motion to dismiss stage of the litigation. In fact, no US lawsuit asserting nuisance or other tort claims predicated on <mark>climate change</mark> theories of liability and entitlement to remedial relief has proceeded beyond the motion to dismiss phase, and there is little reason to think that <EM>Oakland/San Francisco</EM> and the <EM>San Mateo</EM> complaints will fare any better. The <EM>San Mateo</EM> defendants have removed the complaint to federal court, where they will move to dismiss; the defendants in the <EM>Oakland/San Francisco </EM>litigations will likely do the same. The defendants in these cases will be able to assert a number of compelling defenses, which we generally describe and identify below. In our view, the following defenses, alone or in tandem, likely will prove fatal to these California claims.</P><H4>Lack of standing</H4><P>As a prerequisite to asserting a cause of action in federal court, a plaintiff must show that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury, that this injury is fairly traceable to the defendant's alleged conduct, and that the injury can be redressed by a favorable decision by the court. Several prior attempts seeking to hold fossil fuel companies liable for the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> have foundered on this ground. For example, in <EM>Washington Environmental Council v. Bellon</EM>, 732 F.3d 1131 (9th Cir. 2013) (&quot;<EM>Bellon</EM>&quot;), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring suit to compel a state agency to regulate the emissions linked to five oil refineries. The court held that there was an insufficient causal nexus between the defendants' emissions and any injuries that might occur in Washington state as a result of <mark>climate change</mark>. Similarly, the same court held in <EM>Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil</EM>, 696 F.3d 849 (9th Cir. 2012) (&quot;<EM>Kivalina</EM>&quot;), that the plaintiffs – natives of a coastal town in Alaska that was allegedly facing higher risk of storm damage as a result of <mark>climate change</mark> – lacked standing to bring a nuisance suit arising from Exxon's <mark>carbon</mark> emissions because <mark>climate change</mark> has been going on for at least decades and is caused by <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from a multitude of sources. In other words, because <mark>climate change</mark> is a sprawling phenomenon with multiple potential causes and effects, in order to prove standing a plaintiff needs to allege concrete and particularized injuries that directly flow from a particular defendant or defendants' alleged tortious conduct and emissions. Without such a causal nexus, plaintiffs lack standing to pursue <mark>climate change</mark> claims.</P><P>Courts have also dismissed claims for lack of standing on the grounds that the alleged injuries (which can include prospective or anticipated rises in sea levels and storm intensity as is being alleged in the recent California filings) are not sufficiently concrete and particularized. In <EM>Kivalina</EM>, for example, the court held that the plaintiff's claimed injuries (allegedly caused by rising sea levels) could not support standing because they were not bounded in time and not linked to any specific conduct by the defendant in the litigation.</P><P>Other federal courts have also held that plaintiffs do not have standing to assert claims against fossil fuel companies on the basis of future injuries that may be caused by <mark>climate change</mark>. In <EM>Conservation Law Foundation v. ExxonMobil</EM>, No. 16-11950-MLW (D. Mass.), an enforcement suit under the Clean Water Act and Solid Waste Disposal Act, a trial court in the District of Massachusetts recently held that while the plaintiffs did have standing to assert that the defendants were not in current compliance with their environmental permits, plaintiffs did not have standing to assert injuries that could be caused by rising sea levels and other effects of <mark>climate change</mark> that would occur &quot;far in the future.&quot;</P><H4>Federal preemption based on federal common law and Clean Air Act</H4><P>One of the grounds for removal to federal court asserted by the defendants in the San Mateo case is that the plaintiffs' claims are preempted by federal law. This argument is supported by the Supreme Court's 2011 decision in <EM>American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut</EM>, 564 U.S. 410 (2011) (&quot;<EM>AEP</EM>&quot;), where the court held that federal nuisance claims that seek to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions are displaced by the Federal Clean Air Act. The Ninth Circuit in Kivalina followed AEP to reach the same conclusion. <EM>See</EM> 696 F.3d at 857-58.</P><P>While the Supreme Court has yet to extend this federal displacement ruling to bar on preemption grounds claims brought under state nuisance laws, such as <EM>San Mateo</EM> and <EM>Oakland/San Francisco</EM>, a district opinion relied on AEP to conclude that such state law claims are also preempted by federal law. <EM>See Comer v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc.</EM> 839 F.Supp.2d 849, 865 (S.D. Miss. 2012). This conclusion is in line with the federal, or, more accurately – the global scope of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Indeed, as the <EM>San Mateo</EM> defendants argued in their removal petition, the plaintiffs' attribution theory of causation would necessarily require an over-arching analysis of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions across the United States, as well as all other nations across the world. The preeminence of federal law over such questions of interstate and foreign commerce and policy suggests that federal law preempts federal common law and state law nuisance claims that seek to abate <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and address any injuries caused by <mark>climate change</mark>. This is so that <mark>climate change</mark> policy can be developed by the democratically accountable branches of government in a coordinated way at the federal level, rather than via individual tort claims pursued under various theories of state tort law.</P><P>The <EM>San Mateo</EM> defendants also argue that the complaint implicates a number of federal questions that cannot be resolved under state law, including nationwide <mark>climate change</mark> and <mark>carbon</mark> emission policies and the federal regulatory framework governing <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. The removal petitions also raise numerous constitutional questions, such as whether state law can hold corporations liable for promoting an allegedly deceptive campaign to mislead the public as to <mark>climate change</mark>; whether the state nuisance claims will regulate interstate and foreign commerce; and whether due process permits plaintiffs to use state law to hold the defendants liable for the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, given that it is the combustion of fossil fuels, rather than the extraction and marketing of those fuels, that creates the <mark>carbon</mark> emissions that cause <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><H4>Political question doctrine</H4><P>The defendants in <EM>San Mateo</EM> and <EM>Oakland/San Francisco</EM> also may assert as a related defense the political question doctrine, which requires federal courts to abstain from deciding a case in a way that would impinge on the authority of another branch of government. The political question doctrine is rarely invoked, especially when a plaintiff has adequately shown that it has standing to sue. As such, the doctrine is not often discussed in the context of <mark>climate change</mark> litigation.</P><P>In the few cases in which the doctrine has been asserted as a defense, however, at least one district court has held that claims arising from alleged injuries caused by <mark>climate change</mark> are precluded by the political question doctrine because resolution of the claims would require the court to make an initial policy decision to <mark>climate change</mark>. <EM>See People of the State of Calif. v. General Motors, Corp.</EM>, No. C06–05755 MJJ, 2007 WL 2726871 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 17, 2007). Conversely, the Second Circuit, <EM>Connecticut v. American Electric Power Co.</EM>, 582 F.3d 309 (2d Cir. 2009), and Fifth Circuit, <EM>Comer v. Murphy Oil USA</EM>, 585 F.3d 855 (5th Cir. 2009), have reached the opposite conclusion, with the Fifth Circuit holding that tort claims rarely present political questions because the common law of torts provides sufficient rules for the adjudication of a case without interfering with the prerogatives of the other branches of government.</P><H4>Lack of proximate causation</H4><P>If these recent California complaints were to survive the above arguments for their dismissal at the motion to dismiss stage (an outcome we see as unlikely), it will be extremely difficult for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendants caused, or will cause, the alleged injuries. As in any tort suit, plaintiffs seeking to hold fossil fuel companies liable for the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> must show that the defendants' conduct was a proximate cause of the alleged injuries. The problem these plaintiffs will face in proving causation is similar to the problems faced by the plaintiffs in <EM>Kivalina</EM> and <EM>Bellon</EM>, where courts dismissed claims for lack of standing due to the fact that <mark>climate change</mark> is a process that has been occurring for decades as the result of countless emission sources. Indeed, given the inherently indefinite nature of the causal mechanism between <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from countless sources over a multi-decade period and particular issues alleged by a particular plaintiff that are quite localized in nature (<EM>e.g</EM>., rising sea levels off the coast of Northern California), how can a plaintiff show that the emissions of a group of fossil fuel companies selected as defendants in a particular litigation were the reasonably foreseeable cause of any particular plaintiff's alleged injury?</P><P>The plaintiffs in <EM>San Mateo</EM> appear to have attempted to solve this causation problem by alleging that the named defendants are &quot;directly responsible&quot; for approximately 20% of global emissions between 1965 and 2015, by virtue of their &quot;extraction, promotion, marketing, and sale of fossil fuel products.&quot; However, this theory raises several questions such as the following:</P><UL><LI>Does proving that the defendants were responsible for 20% of the global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions mean that the defendants should be fully liable (or 20% liable) to the plaintiffs for the plaintiff's alleged injuries caused by <mark>climate change</mark>?</LI><LI>Why are the defendants &quot;directly responsible&quot; for these emissions while the end users of their fossil fuels bear no responsibility for <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, including private and commercial drivers of cars and trucks; the automobile and airline industries; coal and natural gas power plants; and various other individuals, companies and governments who use fossil fuels to meet their energy needs?</LI><LI>Exactly what is the tortious conduct of these defendants plaintiffs are alleging that caused plaintiffs' injuries? Was it the extraction and sale of fossil fuels, their promotion, or defendants' alleged denials or failures to disclose the effects of fossil fuel production on <mark>climate change</mark>?</LI><LI>Are the plaintiffs arguing that regulators would have banned or severely curtailed the sale of fossil fuels – the energy foundation of our economy since the industrial revolution – had defendants not allegedly denied the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>?</LI><LI>Are plaintiffs arguing that regulators and the scientific community at large did not also know for decades about the potential links between <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and <mark>climate change</mark>?</LI><LI>Can the plaintiffs prove that the defendants' conduct, including their alleged deception as to the causes and effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, led to higher emissions than otherwise would have been the case?</LI><LI>For example, if the defendants had curtailed, or even halted altogether, their efforts to extract, promote, market and sell fossil fuels, what effect would that cessation have had on global emission levels, if any? Would various other private and government entities that are also providers of fossil fuels (not named as defendants in these cases) have increased their own sales as a result?</LI><LI>With respect to the particular injuries being alleged of rising sea levels in California coastal communities, how will plaintiffs demonstrate that these rising sea levels are due to <mark>climate change</mark> in general, let alone the particular emissions of the defendants named in these lawsuits, as opposed to other geological factors?</LI></UL><P>Plaintiffs will have to satisfactorily answer difficult causation questions such as the above in order to prove tort liability and entitlement to remedial relief if the cases were to proceed past the motion to dismiss stage of the litigation. Moreover, many of these same causal questions, as explained above, will merit consideration as part of the analysis of more threshold legal issues to be decided at the motion to dismiss stage, such as lack of standing and federal preemption.</P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><H3>Conclusion</H3><P>The <EM>San Mateo</EM> and <EM>Oakland/San Francisco</EM> complaints face major stumbling blocks at the motion to dismiss phase, and are likely to suffer similar fates as did the plaintiffs in <EM>Bellon</EM> and <EM>Kivalina</EM>.</P><P>While courts have generally been inhospitable territory for <mark>climate change</mark>-related litigation, these cases will be monitored by all sides to see if they can survive into the discovery or judgment phases. Any success by the plaintiffs would increase the prospects of similar suits by other coastal cities and municipalities in California and in other US states. By contrast, the failure of these California claims to proceed past the motion to dismiss stage of litigation could temper enthusiasm for additional lawsuits in this area, at least if the primary goal of these suits is to obtain remedial relief.</P><P>On the other hand, if a principal goal is to use litigation as an instrument of promoting the political and public policy agenda of those funding or pursuing these lawsuits (<EM>e.g.</EM>, by looking to raise public awareness and galvanize public support for stronger <mark>climate change</mark> regulation), then future <mark>climate change</mark>-related claims may still be brought, even if the prospects of winning these cases in the litigations themselves remain extremely remote.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-views pane-our-people-node pane--borderBottom paneTitle--caption""><DIV class=""widthContain""><H2 class=""pane-title"">Key Contacts</H2><DIV class=""view view-our-people-node view-id-our_people_node view-display-id-block_2 profileListing profileListing--carousel view-dom-id-06aec4f98a05ae3c969444a57fc07ace""><DIV class=""view-header""><P>If you have any questions, or would like to know how this might affect your business, phone, or email these key contacts.</P></DIV><DIV class=""view-content""><DIV class=""views-row views-row-1 views-row-odd views-row-first""><DIV class=""views-field views-field-rendered-entity""><SPAN class=""field-content""><DIV about=""/our-people/benjamin-rubinstein"" typeof=""sioc:Item foaf:Document"" class=""ds-2col-stacked node node--contact view-mode-contact_display_block  node--contact-display-block node--contact--contact-display-block clearfix""><BUTTON class=""contactCard-buttonWrapper""><DIV class=""group-left""><DIV class=""field field--name-field-contact-title field--type-text field--label-hidden lang-en""><DIV class=""field-items""><DIV class=""field-item even"">

He also asked the lawyer about a TV show he’d recently seen about the <A href=""https://oceantoday.noaa.gov/ringoffire/"" target=""_blank"" title="""">“Ring of Fire,”</A> volcanic eruptions under the oceans that release levels of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide.</P><P>During the early part of the tutorial, Oxford scientist Myles Allen and Boutrous summarized the work of early atmospheric scientists. One of these was Svante August Arrhenius, a Swedish physicist who theorized in the 19th century that <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions from coal would be trapped in the atmosphere, and raise the earth temperature, since radiation from the earth would have less ability to escape. </P><P>Arrhenius’s findings were eventually recognized as being on target. Alsup was impressed. </P><P>“Don’t you think it’s amazing that that guy ... with just the back of an envelope with pencil and paper, could have made that projection that even today sounds pretty reasonable?” said Alsup.</P><P>Chevron’s Boutrous agreed. “These scientists are brilliant,” he said.</P><P>For students of history and <mark>climate</mark> sciences, Wednesday’s hearing offered a buffet of technical insights. Allen highlighted the research of California’s Charles and Ralph Keeling, a pair of father-son scientists who over decades documented the buildup of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere, confirming predictions of earlier scientists. </P><P>Allen also made note of recent research that has qua<A href=""http://<mark>carbon</mark>majors.org/"" target=""_blank"" title="""">ntified the contribution</A> of industrial oil and gas industries to <mark>climate change</mark>s — data that is likely to surface again in future court hearings.</P><P>After Boutrous made his presentation, regarding the uncertainties listed in the 2013 IPCC report, University of Illinois scientist Don Wuebbles presented for the coastal cities. Wuebbles helped write the latest peer-reviewed U.S. report on <mark>climate change</mark>, <A href=""https://www.globalchange.gov/nca4"" target=""_blank"" title="""">the 4th U.S. <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment</A>, released earlier this year.</P><P>Wuebbles says the latest research shows ever-higher temperatures, including 2016 being the warmest year on record globally. It also warns of more intense wildfires, floods, droughts, coastal storms and other intensifed disasters.</P><P>“The science doesn’t stop at 2012,” said Wuebbles, throwing an elbow at Chevron’s presentation. </P><P>Alsup’s tutorial is a preliminary step to arguments on various legal questions of the San Francisco and Oakland lawsuits. Oil industry lawyers are expected to challenge the cities’ standing to file the litigation, and whether a court is the proper forum to address their complaints.

BP P.L.C. et al.</EM> had both the plaintiffs – the cities of Oakland and San Francisco – and the defendants – several major oil companies – answer basic questions about <mark>climate change</mark> in a tutorial format. Counter to what some might have expected, an oil company lawyer largely confirmed the consensus science on the issue, but challenged the idea that oil companies should be held accountable.</P><P><EM>Stanford Report</EM> spoke with <A href=""https://profiles.stanford.edu/katharine-mach"">Katharine Mach</A>, a senior research scientist at the <A href=""http://earth.stanford.edu/"">School of Earth, Energy &amp; Environmental Science</A>, and <A href=""https://profiles.stanford.edu/deborah-sivas"">Deborah Sivas</A>, the Luke W. Cole Professor of Environmental Law, to get their perspectives on the <mark>climate</mark> tutorial, the science in question and the role of the judiciary in confronting <mark>climate change</mark> challenges.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Why did the judge take such an unorthodox approach, in requesting a tutorial from the parties in this suit?</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Sivas:</STRONG> The way the questions were drafted – relatively straightforward questions of physical science that lead, inexorably, to the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) conclusions – and the way the judge engaged the parties during the proceeding make it pretty clear that the court largely understands <mark>climate</mark> science already.</P><P>The tutorial revealed that there is not going to be a lot of fighting about the fact that human activities are causing accelerated <mark>climate change</mark>. Although it wasn’t an evidentiary proceeding with decisions about the admissibility of factual information, it would be very difficult at this point for the defendants to backtrack and contest the anthropogenic causes of <mark>climate change</mark>. By holding this proceeding, the judge circumvented what could have been a couple of years of jostling and motion practice in discovery.</P><P>Secondly, the tutorial appears to have flushed out and previewed the oil industry’s legal theory in defending the case. From what I can tell, Chevron’s lawyer intimated that the oil companies’ defense will be that the science of anthropogenic causes was not clear until a few years ago and now that it is clear, the industry isn’t denying it; and that the industry shouldn’t be held liable because it is the use of fossil fuels by each and every one of us that is causing the problem, not the mere extraction of the material from the ground.</P><P>Finally, I suspect the court was using this novel case as an opportunity for a bit of public education. The judge likely knew that the media would cover the tutorial proceeding and that there would be some level of public interest in what the oil companies had to say. The fact that oil companies essentially conceded and reiterated the conclusions of the IPCC in open court makes the landscape even more challenging for the last few <mark>climate</mark> deniers still out there.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Why do you think both sides are largely in agreement on the science?</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Mach: </STRONG>Unsurprisingly, the experts who presented for the cities and also Chevron’s lawyer turned to comprehensive assessment of the existing body of research to draw their conclusions. For the past three decades now, the world’s scientists and governments have come together to take stock of the state of knowledge. It’s a grand partnership called the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>. Hundreds of authors from around the world pore over the literature, compare results across studies and draft text. Thousands of experts globally then vet the drafts in multiple rounds of monitored review. In the end, many thousands of publications are cited in thoroughly evaluating what is known and what is not at present.</P><P>With each decade passing, the evidence has amassed. These reports have underscored that the <mark>climate</mark> is warming, unequivocally. <mark>Climate change</mark> and the impacts we are now experiencing are the result of our emissions of heat-trapping gases.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>What can science tell us about whether companies or individuals are more responsible for <mark>climate change</mark>-related impacts?</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Mach: </STRONG>Science doesn’t have a single best answer for who is most responsible for the <mark>climate</mark> challenge or how we should respond. For example, risk assessment across all available evidence underscores that <mark>climate change</mark> unfolds across generations. Exactly how important is the present versus the future? Are people who have emitted the most heat-trapping gases historically – or who are emitting the most right now – more obliged to take action? Building from the science, these kinds of judgments come down to values and the choices societies are making – and, maybe in this case, the courts.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Are there any points of scientific disagreement between the parties in this case?</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Mach</STRONG>: It’s hard to say how science will reappear through the course of the legal proceedings to come. Discussions during the tutorial suggested that the different parties may well take different approaches to the complexities of <mark>climate change</mark>, for example, the deep uncertainties about how societies, policies and technologies will evolve many decades into the future and the implications for <mark>climate change</mark> solutions needed now. <mark>Climate change</mark> assessment has long emphasized that uncertainties are absolutely integral to the <mark>climate</mark> challenge and they will persist. Responding to <mark>climate change</mark> is about managing the resulting risks and making critical decisions about our future.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Where do you see this case going?</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Sivas: </STRONG>It is unclear what this suit, and the others like it, will achieve at the end of the day. If the plaintiffs unearth damaging internal industry documents or force the industry to concede the foundational facts once and for all, that surely serves one public purpose. But whether state and local governments, which are experiencing rising sea levels and related <mark>climate</mark> impacts, will actually obtain compensation from the industry is a much more complex and uncertain question. Ultimately, the plaintiffs must show that a 50-year or whatever delay caused by the industry cover-up is the cause of damages that they are experiencing today. That’s a tall order.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>What legal or political precedent might this case set?</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Sivas:</STRONG> I see this case as part of a growing line of innovative lawsuits, like <EM>Juliana v.

But this hearing and this case will settle nothing.</P><P>The hearing was ordered by U.S. District Judge William Alsup, a nonscientist, who is presiding over a case involving accusations by San Francisco and Oakland politicians that the oil and natural gas produced by ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and other oil companies are causing a <mark>climate</mark> disaster and the oil companies have been covering up evidence of this for years.</P><P>The municipalities will trot out the false claims made popular by the Obama administration (and before that by former Vice President Al Gore) that man-made global warming will cause or is already causing flooding, storms, wildfires, droughts, public health epidemics, etc.</P><P>The oil companies aren’t likely to argue the science. They are on record admitting that <mark>climate change</mark> is the result of human activity and could be a crisis, although the degree and when it will occur are uncertain. They will claim their activities play only a small role in the crisis: Coal and agriculture are bigger offenders, along with Third World countries, industries and consumers who use their products. Why not sue them? Under prevailing tort doctrine, they will argue, they cannot be held liable.</P><P>On the basis of the briefing, if Judge Alsup is fair and balanced, he might conclude that the science is overwhelming that human activities, and in particular the combustion of fossil fuels, are causing a <mark>climate</mark> catastrophe. However, he may find the defendants are right that under common law, they cannot be held responsible for damages when their contributions are very small and cannot be separated or weighed separately from the contributions of others.</P><DIV class=""asset_relatedlinks""><DIV class=""article-related""><H4 class=""in-title"">More on <mark>climate change</mark></H4><UL class=""rel-links""><LI class=""rel-item last""><A class=""hdn-analytics"" href=""/opinion/openforum/article/State-incentives-to-build-must-also-prevent-12747855.php"" data-hdn-analytics=""related_stories|article-12747855|article-12768568|3"">State incentives to build must also prevent displacement</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV><P>Such a finding might be what oil companies are hoping for, but it is not what <mark>climate</mark> science says about man’s impact on the global <mark>climate</mark>. Such a decision would set a bad precedent and send a false message to the general public. Here is why.</P><P>The Nongovernmental International Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, an international network of scientists assembled by the Science and Environmental Policy Project, the Heartland Institute, and the Center for the Study of <mark>Carbon</mark> Dioxide and Global Change to critique the work of the United Nations’ International Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> found thousands of peer-reviewed studies that contradict the alarmist narrative of a man-made <mark>climate</mark> disaster. Among their conclusions:</P><P>•<mark>Climate change</mark> is largely due to natural factors, and the human impact so small it is likely to be undetectable. Past changes in <mark>climate</mark> preceded human use of fossil fuels by centuries and were much larger than those in the recent <mark>climate</mark> record.</P><P>•The most recent scientific research places “<mark>climate</mark> sensitivity”— the amount of warming to be expected from a doubling of the amount of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere — at just 1 to 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, not the 3 to 6 degrees claimed by alarmists.</P><P>•Claims of floods, hurricanes, droughts and wildfires attributable to man-made global warming are not supported by science. Long-term records show no increases, and often decreases, in frequency and intensity.</P><P>•The UN’s IPCC, the source for most of the alarmist literature, is politicized. We know that former President Barack Obama “weaponized” the Environmental Protection Agency to wage war on coal, and that this included suppressing internal dissent in the administration.</P><P>A genuine briefing on <mark>climate</mark> science would conclude there is no “consensus” on the causes or consequences of <mark>climate change</mark>. It would lead a judge to conclude there is no man-made <mark>climate</mark> crisis on the horizon, and so arguing over who is to blame is unnecessary and irrelevant. The judge would then throw out the case “with prejudice,” meaning “don’t come back.”</P><P>Alas, what takes place on Wednesday will not teach Judge Alsup anything about <mark>climate</mark> science. Consequently, the judge’s ruling is unlikely to advance public understanding of the <mark>climate change</mark> issue or advance justice.</P><DIV class=""bodyEm""><P>Joseph L.

In a California courtroom on Wednesday, Chevron’s attorneys didn’t dispute the science that suggested humans, and by extension oil companies, were at least contributing to adverse <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Chevron stock holders need not hit the panic button just yet. Chevron didn’t exactly admit guilt as it pertains to its role in <mark>climate change</mark>. And, the legal argument being levied against “Big Oil” in this particular case is a bit confusing in its goal. Every little bit helps, or hurts, though, depending on which side of the table you’re sitting on.</P><H3>It’s Complicated</H3><P>The pre-trial hearing, which took place in San Francisco, didn’t determine innocence or guilt. The hearing was simply an unconventional way for litigants to decide which weapons would be allowed to be wielded in an upcoming legal battle between the five most prominent oil names and the coastal cities of San Francisco and Oakland.</P><P>They’re suing the five Big Oil icons not to stop spewing <mark>CO2</mark> into the earth’s atmosphere, but rather, to demand these energy companies <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-<mark>climate</mark>change-hearing/chevron-says-it-will-not-dispute-<mark>climate</mark>-science-in-u-s-lawsuit-idUSKBN1GX185"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">help fund the construction of a wall</A> that will keep rising ocean waters from creeping into their cities.</P><P>Chevron’s lawyers, along with attorneys representing the other top four oil names, are asking for a dismissal of the pending case. In the meantime though, none of them are denying that the plaintiff’s evidence of global warming is untrue.</P><P>The defendants are, however, still going to argue they can’t be held liable for the outcome of higher global temperatures. They all agree that only Congress (via the EPA) has jurisdiction over the fossil fuel emissions.	</P><P>The defendants added for good measure that they only provided what was being used by consumers, and that unchecked population growth exacerbated the issue.</P><H3>The Case for Chevron Stock</H3><P>It’s not a bad legal argument, truth be told. As Chevron’s written request for a dismissal <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chevron-will-stick-to-ipcc-findings-in-landmark-<mark>climate</mark>-change-trial/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">noted</A>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“This is not the first (or even the second or third) time a plaintiff has tried to plead global warming-related tort claims. Similar claims have been considered, and dismissed, by the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit, and district courts around the country.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Also weakening the plaintiff’s case is the nature of the suit itself.</P><P>It’s being filed as a nuisance suit, which generally call for the closure of a business or the removal of an annoying eyesore or noise. Not this nuisance suit though. This one is gunning for money. Richard Faulk, public-nuisance experts and counsel with Davis Wright Tremaine, commented on the matter “what we have here is a typical tort lawsuit for damages.”</P><P>The plaintiff’s attorneys aren’t exactly shooting blanks though. Along with Big Oil’s concession that <mark>climate change</mark> is real, even if their role in it has not yet been determined, the suit also claims that the likes of Exxon Mobil, BP and Chevron all funded <mark>climate change</mark> research that was ultimately intended to mislead the public about fossil fuel’s role in damage to the environment.</P><P>As San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said it, “These companies knew their products were causing sea-level rise, and they deceived people about it. Now, that bill has come due.”</P><H3>Bottom Line for Chevron Stock</H3><P>From a pure letter of the law perspective, owners of Chevron stock don’t have a great deal to worry about. At worst it would share a modest amount of liability with the rest of the oil industry, as sole causation has yet to be pegged to oil companies. And, even if it is determined, this really is an EPA matter.</P><P>The deception claims (suggesting that Big Oil paid to deceive… everyone) haven’t worked in other similar cases.</P><P>On the flipside, U.S. courtrooms are increasingly moving away from ruling based on the strictest letter of the law, and <A href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2010/08/in_defense_of_the_new_judicial_activists.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">instead making decisions grounded in a sense of fairness</A>. On the wrong day at the wrong time with a judge and jury in the wrong mood, this could end up being a blow to Big Oil.</P><P>The real risk to Chevron stock, however, goes beyond this one case. By forcing oil companies to take the small step of acknowledging that <mark>climate change</mark> science is valid now, the next step to energy companies conceding fossil fuels are a leading cause of <mark>climate change</mark> is a small one.</P><P>The <mark>climate</mark> activists’ war won’t be won with a decisive victory, but dozens and dozens of successful, progressive skirmishes.</P><P><EM>As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

This includes building more wind and solar farms as well as new battery storage. The company’s wind energy arm announced only <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>actionprogramme.org/news/bp-and-tesla-to-work-on-battery-storage-project-at-us-wind-farm"">last week</A> a project to pilot a Tesla battery at a wind farm in rural South Dakota.</P><P>The initial targets released this week are meant to build momentum and serve “as the basis for even bolder action tomorrow”, said Mr Dudley.</P><P>“But as much as we’re all doing individually and collectively, oil and gas companies alone cannot solve this problem. Our experience in BP tells us that a global challenge on this scale requires everyone playing a part, from consumers to corporations to governments,” he added.</P><P>BP believes that “clear, stable pricing frameworks” are the most meaningful way for governments to incentivise greater low-<mark>carbon</mark> projects and change the behaviour of individuals and business.</P><P>“By responding collectively on these priorities, then even a challenge as complex as <mark>climate change</mark> can be met”, he concluded.</P><P>It remains to be seen whether these initial plans are successful, or enough, to combat the problem, of which companies such as BP play a huge part. Some <mark>climate</mark> advocates were left unimpressed by the pledges; “Improvements in BP’s operational emissions, while welcome, are too small to move the needle to prevent runaway <mark>climate change</mark> or reduce BP’s exposure to <mark>carbon</mark> risk,” said Luke Sussams, a senior researcher at the non-profit <mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker Initiative.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

On September 19, San Francisco filed suit against five of the nation’s largest oil companies demanding they pay for the updates the city needs to protect its residents against <mark>climate change</mark>. The <A href=""https://www.sfcityattorney.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017-09-19-File-Stamped-Complaint-for-Public-Nuisance.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">suit</A>, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court, argues that the corporations—Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Shell, and BP—promoted fossil fuels as “environmentally responsible and essential to human well-being” amid multiple warnings that the planet was in danger.</P><P>The lawsuit cites a slew of examples alleging that the oil companies continued promoting their product when they knew it would harm the environment. A 1968 Stanford Research Institute <A href=""https://www.smokeandfumes.org/documents/document16"">report,</A> for example, warned the American Petroleum Institute and its members (which includes all of the defendants) that sea level rise and changes to the earth’s environment were almost certain. “There seems to be no doubt that the potential damage to our environment could be severe,” the report reads. </P><P>“They made a choice to pursue a business strategy for their profit motive,” San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera says. “Now they’re going to have to pay.”</P><P>Will a lawsuit like this ever prevail? Herrera points to a <A href=""https://www.sfcityattorney.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fourth-Amended-Complaint.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">case</A> in Santa Clara County Superior Court<STRONG>,</STRONG> where a group of California cities and counties, including San Francisco, are suing colossal paint companies like Sherwin-Williams to hold the manufacturers responsible for cleaning up lingering lead toxins in homes. They won a <A href=""https://www.sfcityattorney.org/2013/12/16/after-13-years-a-1-1-billion-verdict-for-california-counties-in-lead-paint-case-2/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">$1.1 billion judgment</A> in 2013 that the paint companies are now appealing.<STRONG> </STRONG>“That’s a good example of why I think our legal strategy is a good one,” Herrera says.</P><P>But the lead paint case has been in the court system for more than 15 years. The oil company lawsuit could easily take a decade to wend through proceedings—which is why the port is keeping its options open. “It would be great if something came out of the lawsuit that we could deploy to our seawall,” Forbes says, “but we’re a ticking time bomb.”</P><P>In the event of a victory, however, the legal strategy could serve as an example for other cities hoping to go after big oil to pay for their own environmental woes. This case is one of five currently underway. The City of Oakland filed a suit similar to San Francisco’s last month. And <A href=""http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Marin-San-Mateo-County-sue-big-oil-over-<mark>climate</mark>-11294549.php"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">two coastal California counties and a city</A> each submitted a suit in July against the same 37 fossil fuel giants charging them with the bill for damages related to sea level rise.</P><P>“Chevron welcomes serious attempts to address the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>, but these suits do not do that,” the company <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cities-sue-big-oil-for-damages-from-rising-seas/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">said</A><EM> </EM>in response to San Francisco and Oakland’s cases.</P><P>Though the port’s vulnerability and risk assessment has estimated the port needs billions to renovate the seawall, Forbes is unsure what that upgrade will look like. “We don’t have a conceptual design,” she explains. “We’re at the beginning of this project.” But the <A href=""http://www.opc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/docs/rising-seas-in-california-an-update-on-sea-level-rise-science.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">consequences of <mark>climate change</mark></A> are already affecting the area, as increased nuisance flooding and high tides have prompted the city to close nearby streets in recent years. </P><P>“<mark>Climate change</mark> is accelerating the rate at which oceans are rising and our lower-lying shoreline areas are increasingly exposed to flood waters,” San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee stated in the city’s <A href=""http://default.sfplanning.org/plans-and-programs/planning-for-the-city/sea-level-rise/160309_SLRAP_Final_ED.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Sea Level Rise Action Plan</A>, which was completed in March 2016. While the lawsuit does not demand a specific dollar amount, the plan reports that failing to prepare for rising seas could ultimately cost the city $35 billion in public property loss by 2100, and an additional $20 billion in private property.</P><P>Walking back towards the Ferry building, passing by Pier 14, Forbes points to the water crashing up against the cement railing between us and the sea. “When we built Pier 14…we didn’t have water like this,” she says. “This is a mess.”</P><FIGURE id=""attachment_522553"" class=""inline-image alignright"" style=""max-width: 630px;""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text""><P><SPAN class=""media-caption"">The view of the Bay Bridge from Pier 14 at the San Francisco Port on October 3, 2017.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""media-credit"">Amy Thomson / Mother Jones</SPAN></P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P> </P></ARTICLE><FOOTER class=""entry-footer""><SECTION id=""mj-article-bottom-membership-widget-3"" class=""widget mj-article-bottom-membership-widget""><H3>FIGHT DISINFORMATION:</H3><P><STRONG>Disinformation is one of the biggest threats our democracy faces.</STRONG> Like our reporting on dark money, it is one of those stories behind all the other stories.</P><P><STRONG>So we want to build a team dedicated to tracking and exposing the forces behind disinformation as a new reporting priority before this fall's midterms.</STRONG> But to do it, we need to raise $100,000 that we didn't plan on before June 30.

It can be motivated by grief (i.e, the Paris tunnel where Diana died, Auschwitz, Pompeii, and Ground Zero). It can be motivated by poverty or ‘poorism’ (i.e, Soweto South Africa, flavelas of Brazil, slums of Mumbai and Delhi). It can be motivated by disaster (i.e, post-tsunami Thailand, post-Katrina New Orleans).</P><P>An onslaught of visitors following some kind of natural disaster, such as those visiting south-east Asia following the 2004 tsunami crisis, or people traveling to New Orleans to see the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, are both current examples of disaster tourism. It’s a shade more controversial than grief tourism. You could argue that those who visit disaster zones – especially when little time has elapsed since the disaster – may hinder the efforts being made to restore communities to a normal way of life. On the other hand, promoting this kind of travel might bring in much-needed income at a difficult time.</P><P>A year after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, the city was gripped by disaster tourism. Rather than visit for Mardi Gras, people were asking for directions to the Lower Ninth Ward, scene of so much suffering during the storm. Soon after the disaster there were guided bus tours to neighborhoods that were severely damaged by storm-related flooding. Some local residents have criticized these tours as unethical, because the tour companies were profiting from the misery of their communities and families. The Army Corps of Engineers has noted that traffic from tour buses and other tourist vehicles indeed interfered with the movement of trucks and other clean up equipment on single-lane residential roads. Furthermore, during the first six months after the storm, most of these neighborhoods lacked electricity, phone access, street signs, or access to emergency medical or police assistance. Simply traveling to these neighborhoods was hazardous. For these reasons, organized disaster tours are now banned from two of the most severely damaged areas in the city, the Lower 9th and St. Bernard Parish near the Industrial Canal.</P><P>On the other hand, such communities as Gentilly and Lakeview, along the 17th Street Canal, have welcomed organized tour groups as a means to publicize the scale of the destruction and attract more aid to the city. Much of the recovery effort in New Orleans relies on out-of-state volunteers and donations. Numerous non profit organizations including <A href=""http:/http://www.habitat.org/default.aspx?tgs=MTIvMTkvMjAxMCAxOjUxOjQ4IEFN"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Habitat for Humanity</A> and the Catholic Church, have converged on the city to gut and rebuild. There is also a movement by local residents to bring congressmen and other national leaders to the city and view the damage in person, since recovery efforts have been hampered by the failure of many homeowners and businesses to receive claims from their insurance providers.<A href=""http:/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_tourism"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_tourism</A></P><P>It is a well known fact that the livlihood of many local business rely on <A href=""http:/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">tourism</A>. According to current travel guides, New Orleans is one of the top ten most visited cities in the United States; 10.1 million visitors came to New Orleans in 2004, and the city was on pace to break that level of visitation in 2005. A 2009 <EM>Travel and Leisure </EM>poll of “America’s Favorite Cities” ranked New Orleans first in ten categories, the most first-place rankings of the 30 cities included. According to the poll, New Orleans is the best U.S. city as a spring break destination and for “wild weekends,” stylish boutique hotels, cocktail hours, singles/bar scenes, live music/conerts and bands, antique and vintage shops, cafés/coffee bars, neighborhood restaurants, and people-watching. Post Hurricane Katrina New Orleans is now a top American city for disaster tourism as well.</P><P>In fact, the official New Orleans Tourism website is promoting disaster tourism at the Louisiana State Museum. The newest  exhibit <A href=""http:/http://www.neworleansonline.com/news/2010/Nov/katrina.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">“ Living With Hurricanes: Katrina and Beyond”</A> highlights Katrina’s devestation and the destruction that it caused the inhabitants of New Orleans and the local environment. The exhibit is a $7.5 million, 6,700 square-foot exhibit on the ground floor of the historic Presbytere in the French Quarter’s Jackson’s Square that tells the  raw and uncut stories of real people caught in the hurricane’s wrath. But the museum is not simply a memorial for the lives lost in the storm, it attempts to entertain visitors in a bizarre mixture of screaming voices, historical jazz and rescue artifacts and rising water to resemble actual flooding. It’s like an amusement park gone wrong.</P><P>Throughout the galleries are various rescued artifacts, including music legend Fats Domino’s baby grand piano found in his flooded Ninth Ward house, a Coast Guard rescue basket and seats from the heavily damaged Louisiana Superdome where thousands of people sought refuge and rescue. There is a leaking floodwall station and an exhibit that looks look like an attic and a roof of a house surrounded by rising floodwaters where visators can view the inundated city surrounding them. There is an evacuation corridor that allows visitors to overhear residents’ voices weighing their options as Katrina approaches. A state of the art “Storm Theater” shows Katrina’s full fury with moving and dramatic footage of the hurricane’s onslaught.</P><P>Although some may find this museum as paying homage to the people that died in the storm and those who were lucky enough to survive, I find it as an exploitation device that capitalizes on the misery and misfortune of a coastal city that is at the mercy of mother nature. This exhibit seems to minimize the seriousness of the storm and the coastal politics that are so closely connected to Hurricane Katrina. In my opinion it is tasteless and fails to respect the trauma that many residents sustained in loosing their homes, and in some cases their lives.  This exhibit seems to go too far beyond disaster tourism and enter into the realm of thoughtlessness and coldness. Many may argue that this exhibit teeters on the line of <mark>devastation</mark> exploitation. And all for the competitive price of $6.00. Whether or not one finds this exhibit offensive, one thing is for sure: “Living With Hurricanes Katrina and Beyond” is a huge tourist attraction and tourism in New Orleans, generally,  is on the rise. Especially since <A href=""http:///www.usatoday.com/money/industries/travel/2010-07-03-new-orleans-tourism_N.htm."" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Landrieu</A> said the city has asked BP for $75 million for a national tourism campaign.http:</P><P>So why are people so drawn to disaster tourism? could it be a taste of authenticity? People are increasingly keen to experience things first-hand, without any intermediaries. Rubbernecking is also a natural reaction: people gravitate towards the unusual and the dangerous. Just look at how traffic slows down when there’s an accident on the side of the road – not because there’s no room to pass, but because everyone wants to get a tiny glimpse of what happened. Or perhaps people are becoming less sensitive, accustomed to the violence and tragedy seen daily on television. Whatever the reasoning behind this phenomenal,  dark tourism has captivated many academics and world travelers alike and is is now drawing a new breed of people to the Big Easy.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Ricardo Ramos, the CEO of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, said: “The system has been basically destroyed.”</P><P>The Hurricane is now heading for the tiny islands of the Turks and Caicos as well as the Bahamas, although they may both be spared a direct hit.</P><P>US President, <A href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-maria-path-puerto-rico-flooding-latest-update-2017-09-22/"">Donald Trump,</A> said he had spoken with the Governor of Puerto Rico, promising to visit the island. “Puerto Rico was absolutely obliterated,”<A href=""http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/21/americas/hurricane-maria-dominican-republic-puerto-rico/index.html"">Trump said.</A>“We’ll work with the governor and the people of Puerto Rico.”</P><P>One way Trump could work with the people of the Caribbean is to recognise <mark>climate change</mark> and how our changing <mark>climate</mark> is partly to blame for the intensity of the current hurricane season.</P><P>During a special sitting of the Parliament of Barbuda to discuss the hurricane, former Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister, Lester Bird, said it’s time Trump and the other “<A href=""http://www.ipsnews.net/2017/09/latest-major-hurricane-leaves-dominica-devastated/"">naysayers of <mark>climate change</mark></A>” woke up and faced reality.</P><P>Bird said: “Our governments must redouble their determination to confront the naysayers of <mark>climate change</mark>, however big and powerful they may be, even when we have a President of the United States, who should really be chastised for withdrawing the United States from [the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement].”</P><P>There is welcome news for people of the Caribbean from elsewhere though. If Trump won’t take action on <mark>climate change</mark>, others will.</P><P>The two Californian cities of San Francisco and Oakland have announced they are suing five major oil companies, blaming them for <mark>climate change</mark>, which poses a “catastrophic risk”. They allege the companies have misled the public on the issue, whilst they made enormous profits.</P><P>This week, the two cities, which sit on either side of San Francisco Bay, announced they would be filing lawsuits in their respective county courts against Big Oil, namely Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell and BP.</P><P>“These fossil fuel companies profited handsomely for decades while knowing they were putting the fate of our cities at risk,” San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said. “Instead of owning up to it, they copied a page from the Big Tobacco playbook.”</P><P><A href=""https://www.sfcityattorney.org/2017/09/19/san-francisco-oakland-sue-top-five-oil-gas-companies-costs-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">He continued</A>: “They launched a multi-million dollar disinformation campaign to deny and discredit what was clear even to their own scientists: global warming is real, and their product is a huge part of the problem. Now, the bill has come due. It’s time for these companies to take responsibility for the harms they have caused and are continuing to cause.”</P><P>Barbara Parker (D), Oakland’s city attorney added: “These companies knew fossil fuel-driven <mark>climate change</mark> was real, they knew it was caused by their products and they lied to cover up that knowledge to protect their astronomical profits. The harm to our cities has commenced and will only get worse”.</P><P>The two cities follow <A href=""http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/351603-san-francisco-oakland-sue-oil-companies-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">Marin and San Mateo </A>counties in Northern California which sued seven major oil companies recently.</P><P>The suits claim the companies knowingly produced oil and gas, despite knowing the risks of <mark>climate change</mark>, and trying to persuade the public that there was nothing to worry about, drawing on evidence that has emerged as part of the #ExxonKnew scandal.</P><P>They are seeking billions in compensation to “<A href=""https://www.sfcityattorney.org/2017/09/19/san-francisco-oakland-sue-top-five-oil-gas-companies-costs-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">hold these companies responsible</A> for the costs of sea walls and other infrastructure necessary to protect San Francisco and Oakland from ongoing and future consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> and sea level rise caused by the companies’ production of massive amounts of fossil fuels.</P><P>Just ask the people of the Caribbean too. They also know what it is to be a victim of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>So #Exxonknew. #BigOil knew. And now it is time they should pay for the harm they caused.</P><P>The cases are: <EM>People of the State of California v.

The report notes that BP did this faster than any other major oil company in the world in 2015-16.
Andrew Hopkins, sociology professor at the Australian National University<EM>, </EM>said it was likely that if the top executives in the company receive such bonuses, then they probably appear further down the organisation. Only those at the top have their bonus conditions disclosed publicly.</P><P>Hopkins said tying executive bonuses to finding new reserves could lead them to make decisions that could lead to major oil spills. <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/bp-modelling-great-australian-bight-oil-spill-new-south-wales"" target=""_blank"">BP’s modelling shows</A> oil from a spill in the Bight could reach as far as the New South Wales coast.</P><P>“That really is an incentive to drill faster and faster drilling is more dangerous or increases the risk of blow out,” he said.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changenews.com/2016/09/28/leading-scientist-tells-norway-to-stop-looking-for-oil/"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>Analysis:</STRONG> Is it time for Norway to stop looking for oil?</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Hopkins’ book, <EM>Disastrous Decisions: The Human and Organisational Causes of the Gulf of Mexico Blowout</EM>, found problematic bonus regimes contributed to BP’s Deepwater Horizon disaster, the largest marine oil spill of all time.</P><P>“That’s what was going on in the Gulf of Mexico,”said Hopkins. “They say they’ve learned their lesson. They’ve learned other technical lessons. But whether they’ve learned these management and organisational lessons, they provide no evidence of that whatsoever.”</P><P>Author of the Market Forces report, Dan Gocher said: “These things have to make a difference. These are their incentives. That’s why they go to work every day.”</P><P>The practice is common throughout the oil industry. <A href=""http://www.ips-dc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EE2015-Money-To-Burn-Upd.pdf"" target=""_blank"">A report</A> last year found that executives at all of the 13 largest US oil companies received reserve expansion bonuses.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changenews.com/2015/07/16/exxon-and-chevron-prone-to-groupthink-on-<mark>climate</mark>-study/"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>Study:</STRONG> Exxon and Chevron prone to ‘groupthink’ on <mark>climate</mark></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The reserve-related bonus are only a fraction of the overall payout an executive might hope for. Bonuses are also awarded for results on safety and environmental protection, which oil companies might argue balances the exploration impetus. None of the oil companies mentioned in the report returned requests for comment.</P><P>Gocher also questioned the rationale of paying out bonuses to executives who oversee the expansion of oil reserves when the world is trying to phase out fossil fuels. In order to prevent the world warming by more than 2C, the limit agreed by world leaders, more than a third of proven reserves <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changenews.com/2015/01/08/arctic-oil-unburnable-in-2c-world-study/"" target=""_blank"">must stay in the ground</A>.</P><DIV id=""attachment_31313"" style=""width: 808px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">The Great Australian Bight.

BP’s Dudley <A href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35210450"" target=""_blank"">has questioned</A> this concept, which is predicated on the world’s governments taking strong enough action to prevent dangerous <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Gocher said: “Executive bonuses predicated on unearthing more fossil fuels when the world needs less shows the extent to which these companies’ business model is broken. They are not just in a state of denial, but actively accelerating towards a brick wall.”</P><P>Oil company share prices are tied to the amount of reserves they have on their books. Companies do not yet know the size of the reservoir of crude in the Great Australian Bight, but a significant find could boost shareholder profits. But if reserves can never be burned, Gosher said the impact on shareholders would be negative.</P><P>Even so, his report noted that 12 of Australia’s largest superannuation funds, which manage shares for millions of Australians, continue to vote overwhelmingly in favour of reserve-linked bonuses despite having made pledges that recognise the importance of <mark>climate</mark> action.</P><P>“There can be no more glaring example of the failure of superannuation funds to effectively engage with companies on <mark>climate change</mark> than their continued blind support for executive remuneration packages which expressly incentivise the expansion of fossil fuel reserves,” said Gocher.</P><DIV class=""yarpp-related""><H3>Related posts:</H3></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"
