	Amsterdam, 23 May 2017 - Today, Filipinos demanding <mark>climate</mark> justice from the companies responsible for fossil fuels that have contributed the significant share of global emissions of industrial <mark>CO2</mark> and methane, (1) invited <mark>Royal Dutch Shell plc</mark> (Shell) to the Philippines to cooperate with an investigation into the responsibility of investor-owned <mark>carbon</mark> producers for <mark>climate</mark>-related human rights harms. Shell, and its subsidiary in the Philippines, the Shell Company of the Philippines Limited, are attempting to stop the investigation. (2) 

</DIV></DIV><DIV><P>At Shell’s annual general meeting in The Hague, AG Saño, one of the Filipinos who petitioned the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines (CHR) to conduct the investigation, (3) hopes to address Shell CEO Ben van Beurden and ask him to attend all hearings and to present Shell’s plans for phasing out fossil fuels in order to prevent further human rights impacts resulting from <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>A prolific visual artist and activist known for his collaborative public murals that champion conservation, peace and human rights, AG Saño survived super-typhoon Haiyan (locally, “Yolanda”), which hit the Philippines in November 2013. His family initially feared he was among the casualties. AG helped carry bodies of those who lost their lives in the immediate aftermath. Today, he continues to use his art and his public messages to help him deal with his experiences and to raise awareness about <mark>climate change</mark>.  </P><P> AG Saño said, “Having escaped death myself, I get to live to tell the stories of those from one of the ground zeros of extreme weather events. These people risk losing everything - their families, their lives, and their way of life. People on the frontlines of <mark>climate change</mark> have everything to lose. What can Shell lose by showing up at the hearings?” Typhoon survivors, community and civil society organisations and notable individuals, petitioned the Commission for the investigation in 2015, two years after Haiyan, which claimed thousands of lives and affected millions of others who have yet to recover. (4) Their aim is to prevent further human rights harms resulting from <mark>climate change</mark> being endured by Filipinos.</P><P>“Shell should demonstrate real leadership on <mark>climate change</mark> and human rights. Companies say a lot of good things on paper about reducing emissions and respecting human rights”, said Desiree Llanos Dee, <mark>Climate</mark> Justice and Liability campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia in the Philippines. “If they really mean it, they will show up and take part in the national public inquiry when hearings begin.”  Twenty-one companies have so far engaged to some degree with the Petition lodged before the Commission, including: Shell Company of the Philippines, Ltd. and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell plc</mark>. (5) Some have shared responses with the NGO Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC). (6) Only one company, Rio Tinto, seems to properly acknowledged the ‘fact-finding’ nature of the investigation. (7) Despite knowing about the severe risks posed by <mark>climate change</mark> for decades, the fossil fuel industry continues to extract and sell oil, coal and gas, which, when used as directed, result in significant amounts of <mark>climate change</mark>-causing greenhouse gas emissions. (8) In 1991, a film produced by Shell showed that the oil giant has long known about the catastrophic risks of <mark>climate change</mark>. (9)</P><P>The national inquiry is one of the many people-powered legal actions related to <mark>climate change</mark> that has been initiated around the globe by Indigenous Peoples in Canada, seniors in Switzerland, farmers from Peru and Pakistan, youth in Norway, Pakistan, Uganda, and the United States, and citizens in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Sweden. (10) In each of these cases, people are using the power of the law, because governments and fossil fuel companies are failing to protect and to respect human rights. <EM>–ENDS-</EM></P><P><STRONG>Notes for Editors:</STRONG></P><P>1)     Heede, R. 2014. <mark>Carbon</mark> Majors: Accounting for <mark>Carbon</mark> and Methane Emissions 1854-2010, Methods and Results Report, April 7, 2014.

Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid to protests of pipelines, disruptions of federal lease sales and environmental groups demanding that oil, natural gas and coal remain buried.</P><P>The problem with the grounder movement is the calamity that would likely unfold with a world left in the dark, Bruce Culpepper, president of Shell Oil Co., told an audience at the Energy Tax Conference sponsored by Bloomberg BNA and Mayer Brown.</P><P>In 2015, fossil fuels were responsible for generating 67% of U.S. electricity.</P><P>Solar and wind combined to generate 5.3% of the 4 trillion kilowatt hours and all renewables together contributed 7%, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).</P><P>Culpepper said Shell believes in addressing <mark>climate</mark> concerns, but he’s not up for the industry being painted as “a bunch of bad guys who just need to leave it in the ground.” Shell Oil Co. is the U.S. affiliate of <mark>Royal Dutch Shell Plc</mark> (NYSE: <A href=""https://www.oilandgasinvestor.com/hart-energy-stock-details-761686?ticker=rds.a&amp;a=detailed"">RDS.A</A>) and employs about 20,000 people, mostly in the Houston and Gulf Coast area.</P><P>“If we were to do that, guess what, everybody that consumes energy, their prices would go up or they’re going to go without energy,” he said. “That impacts the people with the lowest incomes the hardest.”</P><P>And it would be impractical. For those committed to the idea of abandoning fossil fuels, Culpepper suggested finding a cozy spot for resettlement.</P><P>“I say we find a place where they can live and be comfortable when the lights go off because the sun doesn’t shine or the wind doesn’t blow,” he said.</P><P>Shell is actively addressing <mark>climate change</mark> and how to best respond. Part of the company’s reasoning behind February’s <A href=""https://www.oilandgasinvestor.com/even-more-global-shell-megamerger-offers-big-premium-bg-group-790121"">$70 billion purchase of BG Group Plc</A> was the allure of BG’s expansive LNG trading portfolio.</P><P>The acquisition of BG Group makes Shell the largest player in the LNG space. Shell is now more weighted to natural gas than oil and regards gas as a natural bridging fuel as the world struggles to manage growth while also curbing greenhouse emissions.</P><P>The company has already started to talk about itself not as just an oil and gas company, but as an energy company.</P><P>“I’d say we’re drifting more toward gas and drifting more toward a broader range of energy solutions over time,” Culpepper said.</P><H3>Plausible Dependability</H3><P>The future is a slippery thing, whether viewed through astrological charts, the grotesque characters on tarot cards or on the lines crisscrossing a palm.</P><P>Culpepper is no fortuneteller, he said.</P><P>But while Shell steers clear of making predictions, its scenario building is based on plausible assumptions of future world events. Or, as Culpepper describes it, “quantifiable, probable assumptions.”</P><P>Population, energy demand and emissions are variables it plays with to get a glimpse of what one possible future would resemble.</P><P>Population, for instance, will grow to somewhere around 9 billion by 2050, Culpepper said.</P><P>Because of the increased population, energy demand will likely double.</P><P>“Most of that population growth, most of that demand for increased energy is going to take place in what are currently developing or underdeveloped countries,” he said.</P><P>People in those countries will have the same hopes, dreams and aspirations for a lifestyle that is taken for granted in the U.S. and other developed nations.</P><P>To make those economies function, they will need energy.</P><P>“If you don’t have electricity, you don’t have running water. [If] you don’t have clean water, you’re really are not going to have a <mark>sustainable</mark>, developing economy,” Culpepper said.</P><P>Shell’s strategy encompasses power and progress with the idea that more energy needs to be produced with fewer emissions.</P><P>Those forces compete within Shell and other companies and will do so for the next several decades, Culpepper said. What’s clear is that doing nothing will not address <mark>climate change</mark> and switching to a renewable-only power plan isn’t feasible.</P><P>“You also can’t just leap over the so-called hydro<mark>carbon</mark> era and say we’re going to shut it all off and renewables will be the answer,” Culpepper said.</P><H3>A Chaotic Way</H3><P><mark>Climate change</mark> remains a polarizing and mostly political topic.</P><P>However, Culpepper said societal expectations appear to be changing to a point that people want to live on a planet that humanity isn’t destroying.</P><P>“Whether you believe in the science or not, there’s enough cause and effects that people are seeing to say … I’m kind of tired of being flooded and tired of the tornados and hurricanes and tired of the rising sea levels. I expect my government to deal with this,” he said.</P><P>Shell’s move into natural gas has been designed to meet those needs and enable electrification while also investing in areas such as <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage.</P><P>The current election cycle has many people jumping on a bandwagon that demands fossil fuel production cease—renewables will take care of the rest.</P><P>Culpepper said that ramping up renewables, particularly solar and wind, would only go so far.</P><P>The “intermittency problem” caused by lack of sunlight or wind may eventually be solved through <mark>innovation</mark>, such as batteries with greater storage capacity.</P><P>“The power generation sector when you look at it from a consumer point of view, only represents about 20% of the total energy consumed in the world,” he said. “So, yeah, you can continue to put renewables into that but you can’t overcome the need for something to overcome the gaps.”</P><P>That leaves now.</P><P>“At the moment there just isn’t a clear pathway to just forgetting fossil fuels,” he said. “There is something that needs to get done to reconcile those. We call it the energy transition.”</P><P>Natural gas is seen by Shell as one way forward. Because of coal-to-gas switching, the power sector has already met its pre-Paris Accords emission reduction targets.</P><P>However, the high intensity power needs of manufacturing, including production of steel, chemicals and cement require hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s because of the heat and fuel efficiency required.</P><P>Even with great technological strides, including more electric vehicles, five decades from now Shell research suggests power generation will shift.</P><P>“But in our modeling, fossil fuels will still represent 60% to 70% of the chunk of underlying energy even in the year 2050 or 2060,” he said, adding that’s if population and economic growth are more or less as forecasted.</P><P>“We’re not going to be out of the hub of the fossil fuel era any time soon,” he said.</P><P>Culpepper said that it is possible to grapple with the competition between growth and impact on <mark>climate</mark>, but only if the world sees unprecedented coordination, collaboration and <mark>innovation</mark> over the next several decades.</P><P>Simply having the U.S. go down the path alone won’t alter the outcome. The world has to be more aggressive in requiring other nations to live up to their promises through rigorous enforcement.</P><P>“It probably won’t play out that way. It is definitely plausible,” he said. “But it may also play out in a very chaotic way.”</P><P><EM>Darren Barbee can be reached at <A href=""mailto:dbarbee@hartenergy.com"">dbarbee@hartenergy.com</A>.</EM></P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Daniel Yergin, host of the event and vice chairman of IHS Markit, endlessly put the topic to CEOs and ministers from foreign petro-states.</P><P>It became increasingly clear that days of denial or even skepticism around <mark>climate change</mark> is now out of bounds for executives of publicly traded oil and gas companies. Instead, they backed <mark>carbon</mark> taxes as an efficient, market-based way to control <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions. They discussed increasing investments in wind and solar. They talked about unleashing the industry's innovative capacity to find technological solutions, such as <mark>carbon</mark> capture, to keep fossil fuels viable.</P><P>&quot;The low-<mark>carbon</mark> future will reshape the energy space,&quot; said Eldar Sætre, CEO of the Norwegian oil major Statoil. &quot;Some see this as a threat to our industry, but we should rather look for and act on the opportunities it offers.&quot;</P><DIV class=""asset_item asset-item fullwidth"" data-config-asset-position=""7""><DIV class=""hdnce-e hdnce-item-58449""><IFRAME src=""//interactives.ap.org/2015/<mark>climate</mark>-change/?SITE=%5Btxsae%5D"" class=""ap-embed"" width=""100%"" height=""900px"" style=""border: 1px solid #eee;"">

The overwhelming consensus among scientists, however, is that human activities - namely, the burning of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal - are accelerating global warming.</P><P><EM style=""font-weight: bold;"">No argument</EM></P><P>For many in the oil and gas industry, argument is no longer an option as governments around the world join that consensus. In late 2015, the leaders of nearly 200 countries pledged to dramatically lower <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by 2050 in a pact signed in Paris and known as the Paris agreement.</P><P>As nations tighten <mark>carbon</mark> policies, wind turbines and solar panels have become the fastest growing new source of electricity both in the U.S. and worldwide. That has spurred what amounts to an international arms race on low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy, with China, Europe and the United States battling for supremacy.</P><P>European oil giant Royal Dutch Shell is predicting that by 2100, 80 percent of the world's electricity will come from renewables, up from less than 10 percent today.</P><P>&quot;Now that may sound a bit shocking to have an oil company, particularly a big player in the gas business, talk about that,&quot; said Jeff Edwards, general manager of global gas and LNG development for Shell Trading. &quot;But that's just the reality as we see it.&quot;</P><P>Not everyone at CERAWeek was convinced that the age of fossil fuels is coming to an end. Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources of Oklahoma Cirty and a Trump adviser on energy, said he believed the oil and gas industry was unfairly targeted by <mark>climate change</mark> rules during the Obama administration and suggested that Trump would follow through on his campaign pledge to leave the Paris agreement.</P><P>&quot;We have a unique president today,&quot; Hamm said Wednesday, &quot;unique in that he keeps his promises.&quot;</P><P>Other executives and industry leaders called for investing trillions of dollars in new oil and gas projects to meet a growing demand for energy as developing nations, such as India and China, expand their economies. Chevron CEO John Watson dismissed theories of fast-approaching peak oil demand as &quot;wishful thinking.&quot;</P><P>&quot;You still have literally billions of people entering the middle class,&quot; he said. &quot;It may turn over, but if you look at the forecasts, most of them still show growing liquids consumption for some time.&quot;</P><P>That is true to a certain extent. The International Energy Agency is projecting economic growth in India and China will continue to drive up global crude demand for the next two decades. But by 2040, all bets could be off as renewable energy and electric cars are expected to become ubiquitous features of world societies, analysts said.</P><P>Already, the sharp drop in the price of renewable energy is forcing nuclear and coal-fired power plants to shut down, and slowing the development of new natural gas plants.</P><P>&quot;The trend lines are clearly more wind and more solar and all of that will continue to push fossil off the supply curve,&quot; Barry Smitherman, a board member at NRG Energy and former chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission and Public Utilities Commission, said Thursday.</P><P><EM style=""font-weight: bold;"">Asking for proof</EM></P><P>Investors, meanwhile, are taking note. A growing coalition of pension funds and institutional investors is increasing pressure on oil and gas companies to offer proof of how they will adapt their businesses to prosper in a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy. Some European firms, including Statoil and the French oil major Total, have already committed to putting defined portions of their capital spending to energy sources that do not produce <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>While oil and gas executives might be staying on message, the possibility of a U.S. withdrawal from Paris is causing anxiety among proponents of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Dirk Forrister, president of the trade group International Emissions Trading Association, said he worried if Trump did pull out, some developing countries &quot;might think the pressure's off.&quot;</P><P>But with Europe and China showing no signs of backing away from their Paris commitments, the general belief is the trend toward more <mark>carbon</mark> regulation is not going away.</P><P>&quot;The administration will stir up the pot to some extent,&quot; said Dan Reicher, a law professor at Stanford University who served as an energy adviser to former President Barack Obama. &quot;But I think the basic direction is increasingly being set by forces outside the administration.&quot;</P><P> </P><P><EM style=""font-weight: bold;"">Jordan Blum contributed </EM><EM style=""font-weight: bold;"">to this report.</EM></P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The measure requires Shell to disclose the risks that the company could face <A href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/un-negotiators-<mark>climate</mark>-change-deal-peru-just-first-step-painstaking-process-1758500"">if global leaders act</A> to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>“The board has given consideration to the resolution and has decided to recommend that shareholders support the resolution” at the Annual General Meeting in May, JJ Traynor, Shell’s executive vice president of investor relations, said in a letter to shareholders Tuesday.</P><P><mark>Climate</mark>-conscious investors said Shell’s decision could be “transformational” in terms of getting other major oil and gas companies to address their <mark>climate</mark> risks. “I think it’s going to make it harder for other companies to take a less-than-cooperative approach,” Andrew Logan, director of oil and gas and insurance program at Ceres, a U.S.-based investor advocacy group, said on a conference call Tuesday. “It’s a real validation that these concerns are important and deserve attention and transparency from the [energy] industry.”</P><P>The <A href=""http://www.ceres.org/investor-network/resolutions/shell-<mark>climate</mark>-and-<mark>carbon</mark>-asset-risk-reporting"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shell shareholder resolution</A> was filed last year by the Aiming for A Coalition, a group of around 50 British investors and pension funds, including the CCLA Investment Management, the investor arm for the Church of England.

And increasingly we’re seeing their chief executives responding. The question is though, how much is for real and what's just greenwash?</P><P>It’s been just over a year since the Paris <mark>climate</mark> deal was agreed in December 2015 and slowly corporate annual reports are being filed. In these, companies take stock of the year’s changes and assess the future risks to their business. Meanwhile new strategies and corporate statements are being issued. Statoil recently <A href=""https://www.desmog.co.uk/2017/03/10/Statoil-Claims-to-Care-About-<mark>Climate</mark>-Change-Commits-Future-to-Oil-and-Gas"">released a <mark>climate</mark> roadmap</A> and ConocoPhillips has come out <A href=""http://www.smartbrief.com/s/2017/03/us-shouldnt-exit-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-says-conocophillips-ceo"">in support of the <SPAN class=""caps"">US</SPAN> remaining part of the Paris Agreement</A>.</P><P>But what are we to make of all of this? Do the actions of these oil giants match the big words put out by their chief executives when it comes to <mark>climate change</mark>? Has anything really changed since Paris?</P><H3><STRONG>Royal Dutch Shell</STRONG></H3><P>It feels like Shell is going through a bit of an identity crisis. On the one hand, it’s been pretty clear about the risk <mark>climate change</mark> poses to its business and the need to transition to renewable energy. But on the other hand, it sees this as a slow, decadal process and has a record of lobbying against <mark>climate</mark> action.</P><P>Last week headlines were made when Shell announced it was selling off most of its Canadian oil sands assets. Mixed in with this also was <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shell-divestiture-cdn-natural-rsc-idUSKBN16G0PH"">the news</A> that it would now be tying 10 percent of its directors’ bonuses to how well they manage greenhouse gas emissions in their operations.</P><P>It also aims to invest $1 billion in renewable energy by the end of the decade.</P><P>But a look at the bigger picture shows that while these are steps in the right direction, they’re relatively small steps given Shell’s total annual spending comes to $25 billion.</P><P>And according to <A href=""http://energypost.eu/<mark>carbon</mark>-capture-and-use-how-<mark>climate</mark>-friendly-is-it/"">a recent article</A> written by Shell’s <mark>climate</mark> advisor David Hone, the company has “no immediate plans to move to a net-zero emissions portfolio over our investment horizon of 10-20 years”.</P><P>That said, Shell appears to be somewhat ahead of the curve compared to other oil majors. Maybe it's making up for lost time, or perhaps it doesn't want to be left in the dust. Either way, it's not entirely burying its head in the sand. In its <A href=""https://www.desmog.co.uk/2016/03/12/shell-and-chevron-two-oil-giants-two-very-different-approaches-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">annual report last year</A> for the year up to December 2015 it was the first company to recognize that policy action and legal risks due to rising <mark>climate change</mark> concerns are mounting. These same concerns are repeated in <A href=""http://www.shell.com/media/annual-reports-and-publications.html"">this year’s report</A>.</P><P>However, this comes after the <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/28/shell-knew-oil-giants-1991-film-warned-<mark>climate</mark>-change-danger"">Guardian revealed</A> that Shell knew of the impact fossil fuels would have on the <mark>climate</mark> as far back as 1991. In a film on temperature and sea level rise the oil giant accurately predicts what scientists now all agree on about <mark>climate</mark> change.</P><P>Yet, despite the company’s own data, it has spent decades investing in unconventional oil and gas projects. Projects which it has always known are incompatible with tackling <mark>climate</mark> change.</P><H3><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN></STRONG></H3><P>Meanwhile, <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN> is facing <A href=""http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bp-faces-questions-on-growth-prospects-dfdwbw6p5"">significant pressure to boost production</A>. Part of this effort means it continues to expand into more and more challenging projects in search of bigger returns. But it’s having some trouble.</P><P>After strong public opposition to its plans to drill in the pristine waters of the Great Australian Bight it pulled out of the deepwater venture. And now it’s planning a similarly controversial project: drilling for oil near a <A href=""http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2017/01/30/amazon-reef-mouth-bp-total-oil-drilling/"">recently discovered coral reef</A> off the coast of Brazil.</P><P>The company also isn’t performing as well as it would have hoped, with share prices currently sitting 30 percent lower than before its Deepwater Horizon disaster.  All of this has led to rumours of takeovers, with <A href=""http://www.standard.co.uk/business/bp-takeover-chatter-bubbles-back-to-surface-a3486576.html"">reports last week</A> that Exxon was eyeing up the British oil giant.</P><P>And as it continues to lay off workers from its drilling operations on the North Sea, a <A href=""https://www.desmog.co.uk/2017/03/13/revealed-bp-puts-branding-local-schools-while-cutting-north-sea-jobs"">DeSmog <SPAN class=""caps"">UK</SPAN> investigation</A> shows <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN> has been working hard to boost its social license by putting <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN>-branded tutors in primary and secondary schools all across Aberdeen.</P><P>In the <SPAN class=""caps"">US</SPAN>, however, <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN> chief executive Bob Dudley seems encouraged by the change in winds that came with a new White House administration. <A href=""http://www.naturalgasworld.com/bp-rebuilds-for-growth-36200"">Dudley recently said</A> that the political situation meant business is much more open now, saying that the White House is “very interested” in <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN>, “more so than at any times in the last eight years”.</P><P>As <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN> continues to push into riskier projects – and riskier in all senses of the word, from its operations to the <mark>climate</mark> and the marine environment – it will be interesting to see what <A href=""http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/investors/results-and-reporting/annual-report.html"">its annual report</A> (yet to be published) makes of all of this. Last year’s simply recognizes the impact that complying with <mark>climate change</mark> regulations and laws may have on its profit margin.</P><H3><STRONG>Chevron</STRONG></H3><P>Compared to last year, Chevron’s come a long way. Whereas its chief executive John Watson boasted last year that the world will always need Big Oil this year it too has publicly recognized to its investors that <mark>climate change</mark> lawsuits can pose a risk to its profits.</P><P>In its <A href=""http://investor.chevron.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=130102&amp;p=irol-SECText&amp;TEXT=aHR0cDovL2FwaS50ZW5rd2l6YXJkLmNvbS9maWxpbmcueG1sP2lwYWdlPTExNDE2ODY2JkRTRVE9MCZTRVE9MCZTUURFU0M9U0VDVElPTl9FTlRJUkUmc3Vic2lkPTU3#sC86D008E5E23527992562203BD19296B"">annual report</A> for the year up to December 2016 it states: “increasing attention to <mark>climate change</mark> risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and, potentially, private litigation against the company.”</P><P>But amidst growing demand from shareholders for corporate disclosure on <mark>climate</mark> risks, Chevron this month said in a <A href=""https://www.chevron.com/-/media/chevron/shared/documents/<mark>climate</mark>-risk-perspective.pdf"">quietly released report</A> that a transition to lower-<mark>carbon</mark> energy sources would pose only a “minimal risk” to its operations because it’s investing in these options too. It then goes on to explain that oil and gas will remain the fundamental energy sources.</P><H3><STRONG>ExxonMobil</STRONG></H3><P>Like <SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN>, Exxon fails to go beyond the impact of <mark>climate</mark> regulations on its profits. The company however continues to be in the spotlight, from investigations into its long <A href=""//www.desmogblog.com/exxonmobil-funding-<mark>climate</mark>-science-denial"">history of funding <mark>climate</mark> denial</A> to former chief executive <A href=""//www.desmogblog.com/rex-tillerson"">Rex Tillerson</A> becoming part of the new White House administration – the same Rex Tillerson who, as Exxon's chief, <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tillerson-<mark>climate</mark>change-idUSKBN16L06J"">went by the alias 'Wayne Tracker'</A> when emailing colleagues to discuss <mark>climate</mark> change.</P><P>Since Tillerson left the helm, Exxon has made some attempts to improve its <mark>climate</mark> credentials. The new chief executive Darren Woods publicly endorsed the Paris <mark>climate</mark> deal and just weeks after he took over from Tillerson, Susan Avery, a <mark>climate</mark> scientist, was appointed to the company’s board.</P><P>This comes after the company’s shareholders <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/exxons-ceo-just-won-his-shareholders-rejected-<mark>climate</mark>-change-proposals-573d12dde5e7#.egn8vq2r5"">failed to do just</A> that during Exxon’s annual general meeting last summer. During this meeting three other <mark>climate</mark> related initiatives were voted down including one to stress test the business to avoid 2C warming.</P><P>However, <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/business/energy-environment/darren-woods-exxon-mobil-investors.html"">no major shift on strategy</A> was announced during Woods' first speech on March 1 since being appointed to lead Exxon. Instead, investment priorities will continue to be in oil and gas.</P><P>The company also appears to be taking full advantage of the new <SPAN class=""caps"">US</SPAN> administration’s warm welcome to oil lobbyists as it <A href=""//www.desmogblog.com/2017/03/12/exxon-peabody-epa-science-advisory-board"">pushes for weaker regulations</A> on the oil and gas industry.</P><P><SPAN style=""font-size:11px;"">Photo: <A href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/drewkolb/7345933648/"">Drew Kolb</A> via Flickr | <SPAN class=""caps"">CC</SPAN> 2.0</SPAN></P><DIV id=""block-block-109"" class=""block block-block first odd""><DIV class=""inline-newsletter-form us""><SPAN class=""inline-newsletter-label"">Get Weekly News Updates</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Larry Larson, senior policy adviser at the Association of State Floodplain Managers, told Stein, “I would venture to say that a lot of the facilities damaged in Harvey have been rebuilt at least once, if not twice, with taxpayer dollars.”</P><P>Oakland and San Francisco, along with a few other cities that have filed similar suits, aim to change that. They want fossil fuel companies, not taxpayers, to pay for raising buildings, constructing sea walls, and implementing other programs to help protect them from flooding.</P><P>According to <EM>Scientific American</EM>, “A spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell called <mark>climate change</mark> a ‘complex societal challenge’ to be addressed by governments, ‘not by the courts.’” Of course, that would work out pretty well for Royal Dutch Shell and its competitors, since President Trump’s government <A href=""https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2017/05/01/<mark>climate</mark>-epa-finally-scrubs-<mark>climate</mark>-change-related-pages-website/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">has made it plain</A> they have no intention of taking action on <mark>climate change</mark>.

All of these questions and more will be debated in the coming months, as the water levels rise.—Erin Rubin</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

				Posted on <A href=""https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/royal-dutch-shell-oil-and-gas-for-environmental-sustainability/"" rel=""bookmark"">November 4, 2016</A></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""submission__excerpt entry-summary""><P>Is Shell going to adapt to environmental change or become obsolete?</P></DIV></HEADER><DIV class=""submission__content entry-content""><P>Large oil and gas conglomerates have historically been the target of social criticism given their role in the production of <mark>carbon</mark> based fuels.  Royal Dutch Shell, as one of the top ten largest companies in the industry, has been no exception.  While their recognition of <mark>climate change</mark> as a serious global issue is public and certain, the question remains whether they are doing enough.  While this question can most certainly be asked in the light of social responsibility and morality, I shall seek to assess this question based upon the likelihood of success.  More specifically, is Shell doing enough to retain long term business success while supporting global efforts to reach greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets?</P><P>The Paris Agreement, ratified by 97 global parties and taking effect November 4 (today), agrees to hold the increase of global average temperature to well below 2˚C above pre-industrial levels.  This requires a significant reduction in the global levels of GHG emissions, likely to be achieved by governments using <mark>carbon</mark> emissions trading systems and further incentivizing the use of clean renewable energy sources.  This is expected to lower demand for fossil fuels.</P><P>Royal Dutch Shell demonstrates a corporate awareness of the shifting future of global energy through its ‘Shell energy scenarios to 2050’ report.  Identifying the critical human conundrum of the day as “more energy, less <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide,” Shell simplifies our potential futures into two potential scenarios of survival:  Scramble, or Blueprints.  In the Scramble scenario of the world, global policy makers do not respond sufficiently to the threat of <mark>climate change</mark>, leading to decisions favoring growth and cheap energy consumption.  Energy use is predicted to shift to coal, resulting in severe <mark>climate</mark> shocks that force the world to evolve into use of biofuels, and ultimately renewable energy sources.  In the Blueprints scenario, grassroots efforts originate out the recognition of the need and potential benefit of energy <mark>innovation</mark>.  Local efforts eventually drive national and then international alignment, with <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage (CCS) being applied to all fossil fuel energy generators while alternative renewable energy plants scale up.  Neither scenario is an ideal or perfectly smooth transition to a <mark>sustainable</mark> global economy, leading the report to introduce the principle of TANIA: There Are No Ideal Answers.  Former CEO Jeroen van der Veer notes in his foreword that in Shell’s perspective, the Blueprints scenario offers the best path towards a <mark>sustainable</mark> future, urging for ‘clear thinking, huge investment, and effective leadership’.</P><P>However, despite all this forward thinking and strategic analysis, it is not clear that Shell has been able to embrace change at the rapid pace necessary for its own forecast.  Based upon the Shell 2015 annual report, the business has made incremental investments towards CCS technology.  Renewable energy projects remained largely absent from the portfolio as of yearend 2015.  In May 2016, a shareholder meeting resulted in a 97% vote rejecting a proposition to invest profits from fossil fuels into renewable energy projects.  Shell’s net income attributable to shareholders dropped a steep 87% from 2014 to 2015 due to low oil prices coinciding with rising production costs. CEO Ben van Beurden addressed the challenges of switching to renewable energy sources while maintaining the current business model and satisfying investor demands for consistent dividend payouts: “If collectively we find a way to stay within the 2 degree (Celsius limit), we will still need significant investment in oil and gas…I am talking about up to a trillion dollars every year.”  Based upon this, it seems that renewable energy and CCS solutions will remain a minor portion of the business, pending future investor interest or changes in financial incentives.</P><P>In May 2016, Shell organized its renewable energy investments into a separate business unit, titled ‘New Energies,’ receiving an annual investment budget of $200 M.  This business unit covers investments in biofuel, hydrogen fuel, wind and solar energy.  Its CCS joint venture, Quest, received C$865 M from the Canadian government and started operations in Alberta in 2015.  Since start-up, Quest has reduced <mark>CO2</mark> emissions by 315 kilotonnes.  Shell has the potential to continue innovating in CCS technology as well as renewable energies, but has clearly demonstrated a lack of willingness to scale up these efforts unless investors are able to forego payouts, or financial incentives in the sustainability space improve.  This bodes poorly for Shell’s long-term dominance in the energy space, as their own energy scenarios have forecasted.</P><P>Word count: 731 words</P><P><mark>Royal Dutch Shell plc</mark>. 2015 Annual Report.

This is <SPAN class=""xn-money"">$5 billion</SPAN> more than the outlook Shell provided during its capital markets day in <SPAN class=""xn-chron"">June 2016</SPAN>.</LI><LI>Debt reduction remains a priority. Gearing stood at 25.4% at the end of Q3 2017 and additional divestment proceeds of more than <SPAN class=""xn-money"">$5 billion</SPAN> since then mean that 20% gearing is in sight.</LI><LI>The delivery of new projects continues, and the company remains on track to deliver 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, and <SPAN class=""xn-money"">$10 billion</SPAN> of cash flow from operations from new projects by 2018 (at <SPAN class=""xn-money"">$60</SPAN> per barrel, real terms 2016). We expect to deliver an incremental <SPAN class=""xn-money"">$5 billion</SPAN> cash flow from operations by 2020.</LI><LI>The <SPAN class=""xn-money"">$30 billion</SPAN> divestment programme between 2016 and 2018 is almost delivered, with deals worth <SPAN class=""xn-money"">$23 billion</SPAN> completed (headline), <SPAN class=""xn-money"">$2 billion</SPAN> announced, and <SPAN class=""xn-money"">$5 billion</SPAN> in advanced progress. Once this programme is completed the company expects to continue divestments at an average rate of more than <SPAN class=""xn-money"">$5 billion</SPAN> until at least 2020.</LI><LI>The company's commitment to capital discipline remains. Annual capital investment will continue to be between <SPAN class=""xn-money"">$25 and $30 billion</SPAN>, and at current oil prices capital investment will be managed towards the bottom end of that range, or lower if needed.</LI><LI>Annual underlying operational expenditure will remain below <SPAN class=""xn-money"">$38 billion</SPAN> until 2020, with efficiency gains expected to deliver further reductions, building on more than 20% reduction in operational expenditure since 2014.</LI></UL><P>The company expects to continue to grow organic free cash flow throughout the 2020s at a more moderate rate. Increased distributions to shareholders in the form of share buybacks in line with the plans confirmed below is expected to support a stronger growth in its metrics per share.</P><P><B>Increas</B><B>ing</B><B> distribution</B><B>s</B><B> to shareholders</B> </P><P>The company is confident it can cancel its scrip dividend programme while investing at sufficient levels to maintain value accretive growth in the portfolio. The strength of its balance sheet, coupled with stronger cash flow and a relentless focus on capital efficiency, discipline and flexibility, have given the company the confidence to cancel the scrip dividend programme with effect from the fourth quarter 2017 dividend. Separately, as per intentions stated in <SPAN class=""xn-chron"">December 2015</SPAN> at the time of the combination with BG, the company is confirming the plans for share buybacks of at least <SPAN class=""xn-money"">$25 billion</SPAN> in the period 2017-2020, subject to progress with debt reduction and recovery in oil prices.</P><P><B>Strategy </B><B>updates </B> </P><P>Against the backdrop of ongoing volatility in the energy sector, Shell today presented the following updates to investors:</P><UL type=""disc""><LI>In <B>Integrated Gas</B>, the resilience and good financial performance of the business continue to be underpinned by its position as a leader in both the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) and gas-to-liquids value chains, as well as by the underlying strength Shell sees in natural gas and LNG markets. To sustain its strength and competitive advantage in LNG through the 2020s, the company will continue to assess opportunities for selective growth - cost competitiveness will be a key decision criterion.</LI><LI><B>Upstream</B> has implemented a successful and continuing operational excellence programme, delivering more production and lower costs. A focus on capital efficiency and portfolio optimisation has led to a more resilient and competitive performance. Management is confident in the growth, increasing returns and sustainability of the company's upstream portfolio into the next decade.</LI><LI><B>Downstream</B> continues to deliver strong financial performance, due to highly integrated refining, trading and marketing operations, and premium products, in addition to competitive growth in the Chemicals business. Strong brand and customer reach are key differentiators that Shell will leverage further to increase the size of this growing and high return business.</LI><LI>The development of <B>n</B><B>ew </B><B>e</B><B>nergies</B> as a future growth platform will accelerate and the company will increase the capital allocated to this business to <SPAN class=""xn-money"">$1 to $2 billion</SPAN> per year until 2020. Shell will continue to target opportunities in new fuels and power, two businesses adjacent to its Downstream and gas businesses that play to Shell's existing strengths in brand and value-chain integration.</LI></UL><P>Shell groups its seven strategic themes into three categories - cash engines, growth priorities and emerging opportunities.</P><P>Integrated Gas, conventional oil and gas, and Oil Products are currently cash engines<I>;</I> deep water and Chemicals are growth priorities; shales and new energies are emerging opportunities. Illustrating the dynamic nature of the company's portfolio, the intention is for deep water to have become a cash engine by 2020, and shales to have become a growth priority by 2020.  </P><P><B>Reducing net <mark>carbon</mark> footprint</B> </P><P>Shell further positioned itself for the future today by unveiling its ambition to cut the net <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of its energy products by around half by 2050.  As an interim step, by 2035 it will aim for a reduction of 20%.</P><P>The company will measure its progress by disclosing the net <mark>carbon</mark> footprint not just from its operations and energy use, as it does now, but also from the use of its energy products, expressed in grams of CO<SUB>2</SUB> per megajoule consumed and taking account of any emissions offset. This measure will be tracked over time, with reviews every five years to ensure Shell is progressing in line with societal progress towards the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint reduction required to meet the <SPAN class=""xn-location"" itemprop=""contentLocation"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Place""><SPAN itemprop=""geo"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/address""><SPAN itemprop=""addressLocality"">Paris</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN> goals.  </P><P>&quot;Tackling <mark>climate change</mark> is a cross-generational, global and multi-faceted effort,&quot; <SPAN class=""xn-person"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Person""><SPAN itemprop=""name"">van Beurden</SPAN></SPAN> said. &quot;This is a challenge for the whole planet, for all of society, for customers, for governments and indeed for businesses.

Be they concerned with <mark>climate change</mark>, human rights abuses or health and safety, the Royal Dutch Shell group has a sullied reputation and not only among environmentalists: In September 1993 the TGWU (transport and general workers union) launched a nationwide boycott of Shell petrol stations due to union derecognition at their Shell haven refinery in Essex.</P><P>Shell now paints itself as a caring company wishing to dissociate itself from past ‘mistakes’ in Nigeria and ‘accidents’ in the North Sea.</P><P>Some of the examples here are historical, but they give an insight into Shell’s culture and despite liberal greenwash, things haven’t really changed so there are more recent examples as well.</P><H3><mark>Climate Change</mark></H3><P> </P><P>When it withdrew from the Global <mark>Climate</mark> Coalition in 1998 (see Influence/Lobbying section) Shell wished to be seen as one of the pioneer corporations, taking <mark>climate change</mark> seriously. Even before it withdrew from the GCC, Shell had been attempting to cultivate this image. In May 1997, the day after John Browne gave his speech at Stanford university stating that BP had reached a point where it must consider “the policy dimensions of <mark>climate change</mark>”[65] (see BP profile), Heinz Rothermund, Managing director of Shell UK Exploration and Production, asked in a lecture he gave at Strathclyde University, “How far is it sensible to explore for and develop new hydro<mark>carbon</mark> reserves, given that the atmosphere may not be able to cope with the greenhouse gases that will emanate from the utilisation of the hydro<mark>carbon</mark> reserves discovered already? Undoubtedly it is a dilemma”.[66]</P><P>Shell, however has not translated this concern into action, it has not ceased or scaled back its exploration and production activities. Quite the opposite, Shell has ambitious plans to increase extraction by 5 per-cent year on year[67]. So far the company is on target: “Compared to the third quarter last year, total hydro<mark>carbon</mark> production increased by 5 per-cent”[68]. However, a question mark hangs over the potential for sustained growth at this rate: Phil Watts, delivering the group’s 2nd quarter results for 2001 said that plans to grow output by 5 per-cent between 2000 and 2005 now looked “Very challenging” amid the slowing world economy. Analysts predicted that Shell could scale back its growth target to 3 per-cent, but Mr. Watts refused to be drawn on a figure for longer- term production growth[69].</P><P>Scaling back production does not suit a company like Shell whose worth, despite some investments in renewables, is measured in production volumes and proven reserves. In June 1990, the then chairman and Chief Executive Designate of Shell UK, Sir John Collins, suggested that we “see this great challenge [<mark>climate change</mark>] as a spur to ingenuity, the free market and <mark>sustainable</mark> economic development.”[70]. So Shell has opted for a techno-fix: In 2000, Shell, together with Siemens began developing a pilot gas-fired power station in Norway, which will capture its <mark>Carbon</mark> Dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>) emissions and pump the gas underground[71]. There are both technical and ethical questions over the use of this unproven technology in combating <mark>climate change</mark>[72]. Most bizarrely of all, <mark>CO2</mark> injection will be used for what is known as ‘enhanced oil recovery’ gas will be injected to increase the pressure of declining fields[73]. What is sold to the public as a solution to <mark>climate change</mark> will actually be used to extract more oil.</P><P>In accepting the reality of <mark>climate change</mark>, Shell announced in 1989 that the company was going to increase the height of its giant ‘Troll’ platform by 1 meter, to counter predicted rise in sea-level. The platform can be raised further if it becomes necessary over the proposed 70 year lifespan of the rig[74].</P><P><STRONG>West of Shetland</STRONG></P><P>Environmental campaigners have long opposed the opening of the so-called Atlantic-Margin or Atlantic-Frontier to oil exploration. Opposition was on the grounds of <mark>climate</mark>-change but also because this area of deep ocean, west of Shetland and further, beyond Rockall had previously been largely free of commercial activity.</P><P>Most of Shell UK’s production comes from the North Sea: Gas fields are mainly in the southern sector and oil comes from the more northerly fields, including the large Brent field. Companies which operate in the North Sea are aware that these areas are probably already past their peak and that production is likely to decline over the coming decades. Because no tax is payable on oil and gas from UK waters, the UK is a operating environment favoured by companies, so these corporations have been looking for new reserves in the UK to replace declining North Sea production.</P><P>In November 1997 Shell was a partner with operator BP in the Foinaven field, 190km west of Shetland, the first Atlantic Margin field to come on-stream[75]. But on the 6th of December 2000 Shell announced that it had completed an asset swap agreement under which it would part with its 28 per-cent interest in the BP-operated Foinaven field, plus its interests in discoveries and prospects in areas adjacent to Foinaven. In exchange Shell would acquire an interest in Sakhalin Energy Investment of Russia[76].<A href=""https://corporatewatch.org/company-profiles/royal-dutch-shell-corporate-crimes#top"" class=""broken_link"">Back to top</A></P><P><STRONG>Renewable Energy</STRONG></P><P>As part of efforts to brand itself as a forward-looking new-energy company, Shell has begun to invest in off-shore wind energy. Shell is a partner in the Blyth offshore wind project in Northumberland[77]. Industry analysts see this investment favourably, since unlike BPs investment in solar Shell already has expertise in off-shore operations which it can transfer to its renewables division.</P><P>As Shell itself states: “Wind energy should profit everyone and harm no-one”. A laudable sentiment, but in continuing to explore for more oil, the company fails to recognise that renewable energy will only be a solution to <mark>climate change</mark> where it replaces energy which would otherwise have been generated from fossil fuels.</P><P>For more on Shell’s <mark>climate change</mark> strategy see the ‘Influence and Lobbying’ Section of this profile.</P><P><STRONG>Missing The Big Picture</STRONG></P><P>Since the 1980s Shell has cut its air and water <mark>pollution</mark> and, through energy efficiency cut its own energy usage. Shell has described its approach as “The pursuit of excellence in environmental performance” [78]. Sadly, the company fails to acknowledge that oil and gas is inherently a highly polluting business, both locally and globally, upstream and down. Despite token moves into offshore wind energy Shell, like all oil companies believes that fossil fuels will remain the dominant source of energy for decades to come, and that renewable energy simply could not meet world energy demand. But this is a prescription dressed up as a description: It comes from the companies which dictate the nature of our energy supply[79].</P><P>Measurable reductions in local environmental <mark>pollution</mark> at Shell facilities have been achieved relatively easily and have been good for public relations, but this disguises the fact that in the early 1990s Shell was regularly breaching its <mark>pollution</mark> consent limits (35 times in 1991)[80] and as such had, in the UK at least, a statutory duty to improve environmental performance. It also ignores the reality that to reduce local <mark>pollution</mark> whilst simultaneously seeking new oil and gas is to fudge the <mark>pollution</mark> issue. Genuine good environmental and social practice cannot be achieved piecemeal or out-sourced to public relations consultants.</P><P><A href=""https://corporatewatch.org/company-profiles/royal-dutch-shell-corporate-crimes#top"" class=""broken_link"">Back to top</A></P><P><STRONG>Oil Leak and Drilling Muds</STRONG></P><P>Shell was less proficient in reducing local <mark>pollution</mark> in August 1989 when 150 tons of thick Venezuelan crude leaked from a Shell pipeline, into the River Mersey (UK)[81]. The spill caused a 20 mile slick and killed at least 300 sea birds, putting another 2000 at risk due to oil ingestion. The nearby New Brighton mussel beds were also contaminated[82]. The incident was made worse because Shell, against the warnings of local police and councillors[83] flushed the pipeline with lighter crude and water, in order to stop oil from solidifying and blocking the pipe.</P><P>The National Rivers Authority was not informed of the spill by Shell but by the local fire Brigade, two and a half hours after the event. If they had been notified earlier, the flushing attempts would have been prevented[84]. The official Department of Energy report concluded that the pipe was badly corroded and that the monitoring equipment was so inadequate that it could not detect problems[85]. Shell was fined one million pounds at Liverpool Crown Court, with costs of 6573 pounds – the largest ever fine in the UK for a <mark>pollution</mark> incident[86].</P><P>After several further spills and leakages, and amidst mounting criticism of the refinery, the General Manager of the plant, Bob Brawn told employees, that: “If I was running this plant in the United States or in Canada I would be in jail by now”[87].</P><P>Contamination also emanates from exploration and production. For example, in April 1989, there was a 50000 gallon leak of toxic drilling muds from Shell’s North Cormorant oil field in the North Sea[88].</P><P><STRONG>Better Britain</STRONG></P><P>The now well established Shell Better Britain campaign (SBBC) is an attempt by Shell to win public support by funding “Communities in efforts to improve their local environment in a <mark>sustainable</mark> manner, from organic growing to cycle taxis”[89].</P><P>However, the scheme has split environmental groups over the ethics of accepting such money, particularly since the scheme has been so successful in earning Shell the image of a good corporate citizen. For example, the judge who, in 1990 fined Royal Dutch/Shell Group one million pounds over an oil leak into the river Mersey (UK) the previous year (see above), commented that the fine would have been substantially higher if Shell had not had such a good record in conservation, the arts and other worthwhile causes[90].</P><P>As long ago as 1991, then campaigns director of Friends of the Earth: Andrew Lees criticised the Shell Better Britain campaign as being an example of corporations buying a green image rather than actually earning one[91].</P><P>In 1989, Shell defeated a decision by Kent County Council (UK) to stop the company drilling in a classified Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty,[92] and in 1990 the company decided to build a pipeline construction facility on Morrich More, a grade one Site of Special Scientific Interest and an EC (European Community) Protected Area, and the only breeding site in the UK of the whimbrel, a rare wading bird[93]. In 1992, Shell began drilling 21 miles off the Sunderland coast, north east England. The area is close to 21 sites of special scientific interest (SSSI) and to Flamborough Head, a well known nesting site[94]. Shell’s contribution to Britain is distinctly mixed.<A href=""https://corporatewatch.org/company-profiles/royal-dutch-shell-corporate-crimes#top"" class=""broken_link"">Back to top</A></P><P><STRONG>Human Rights Violations</STRONG></P><P>In 1991 EIRIS (Ethical Investment Research Service) stated that Shell was operating in 24 Countries where extra-judicial executions or disappearances had been reported, 44 countries where torture has been reported (according to Amnesty International), 36 Countries where ‘official violence against citizens’ was reported, and 26 countries which were holding prisoners of conscience (according to Amnesty International)[95].</P><P>By 1999, following extensive public relations on the part of Shell, including the annual publication of “People, Planet and Profits, The Shell Report” EIRIS had revised its opinion of Shell, stating that “a number of companies such as Shell … have now recognised … the new emerging agenda”[96].</P><P>A copy of “The Shell Report” can be read online at:<A href=""http://www.shell.com/shellreport""> www.shell.com/shellreport</A></P><P>Others, such as UNPO (Unrepresented Nations and Peoples’ Organisation) have been less convinced by the greenwash: “Although Shell International stopped its activities in Ogoniland [Part of Nigeria], the degradation of the environment still continues. Abandoned pipelines cause major troubles. Due to leakages the oil runs freely and destroys the Ogoni lands. Shell accuses the Ogoni people of sabotaging the pipelines; the Ogoni people blame Shell for not keeping the pipelines in repair.”[97].</P><P><STRONG><A href=""mailto:eraction@infoweb.abs.net""> eraction@infoweb.abs.net</A></STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Chad-Cameroon</STRONG></P><P>Under pressure from human rights activists Shell withdrew from the 3.7 billion dollar Chad-Cameroon oil and pipeline project in 1999. The project will involve the development of more than 300 oil wells in southern Chad and the construction of a 1050km pipeline, southwards to Cameroon’s Atlantic coast. The project could still go ahead and will likely be backed by ExxonMobil and Chevron. The project can only strengthen Chad’s repressive regime and there are worries that it will lead to destruction of rivers and coastal rainforest[104]. Shell’s oil Exploration activity continues in less controversial off-shore Cameroon[105] where, fortunately for Shell, it does not have to contend with indigenous communities blighted by oil.</P><P><A href=""https://corporatewatch.org/company-profiles/royal-dutch-shell-corporate-crimes#top"" class=""broken_link"">Back to top</A></P><P><STRONG>Peru and Columbia</STRONG></P><P>Shell mounted a similar retreat from Peru. In 1996 Shell Prospecting and Development (Peru) signed a licensing agreement with the Peruvian government for the Camisea project, controversial because exploration was to place in pristine rainforest, in an area inhabited by several vulnerable indigenous populations, including 2 of the world’s last isolated nomadic peoples[106]. Since 1996, Shell has found Gas along the Urubamba River in Peru[107] but has pulled out of the Camisea project. Despite attempts to portray the project as a model of <mark>sustainable</mark> development, the company was unable to win the ‘green’ stamp of approval from NGOs, without such support the cost of the project to Shell in public relations would have been too great.</P><P>Seemingly for similar reasons, Shell also pulled out of a joint venture with Occidental Petroleum, a venture engaged in exploration activity in the equally fragile Colombian rainforest[108].</P><P><STRONG>Pakistan</STRONG></P><P>Like a number of other oil companies, Shell takes a keen interest in the potential for downstream marketing activities in the emerging markets of central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Shell is also involved in exploration and production in Pakistan[109]. This included the Dumbar concession, which covered exploration rights over most of the Kirthar National Park in the south-eastern Sind province. The concession was granted by the provincial government to a joint venture between Shell Pakistan and Premier Oil (See Corporate Watch profile: Premier Oil). Public controversy over oil exploration in such a sensitive, protected environment erupted after Pakistani ‘<mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Policy Institute’ in Coalition with 8 other NGOs announced, in February 2001 that it was mounting a legal challenge to have the concession overturned[110].</P><P>In response to such bad press, and concerned for its reputation, Shell announced in May 2001 that “it was seeking to end its Pakistan joint venture with Premier Oil by proposing to swap its 49.9 per-cent stake in the joint venture for an increased holding of up to 28 per-cent in Premier’s Bhit gas field elsewhere in Pakistan. Industry sources said that shell “was looking to lessen its exposure in exploration activities and the move could be part of the strategic decision”[111].</P><P>Shell’s strategy is clear: Following bad publicity in the 1990s, and wanting to brand itself a caring company, Shell is withdrawing from the most controversial projects in Nigeria, Cameroon and Pakistan, whilst continuing to operate in those countries and support those regimes.</P><P>Real concern for human rights would mean pulling out of dictatorships such as Nigeria, Pakistan and China. For details of Shell’s interests in these countries see: Financial and Operating Information, 1996-2000[112].</P><P><STRONG>Health and Safety</STRONG></P><P>Examples of poor health and safety are given here from Shell’s North Sea operations where they operate in joint venture with Esso[113]. Access to information on such incidents is relatively easy in the UK, but health and safety, like environmental performance is generally worse in poorer countries, where statutory standards are often lower. The company is also less dependent on those markets for selling its products and so has to worry less about its public image. Royal Dutch/Shell group states that its “companies act in a socially responsible manner within the laws of the countries in which they operate”[114]. As such, Shell’s approach is consistent with principle 11 of the Rio Declaration from the Earth Summit of June 1992 which states that “…Standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate and of unwarranted economic cost to other countries in particular developing countries.”[115] In practice, Shell will adopt lower standards in the developing world, where it can get away with it.</P><P><A href=""https://corporatewatch.org/company-profiles/royal-dutch-shell-corporate-crimes#top"" class=""broken_link"">Back to top</A></P><P><STRONG>North Sea</STRONG></P><P>Health and safety is paramount in the harsh environment of off-shore oil exploration and production. The British North Sea has been the scene of a number of serious incidents which have often led unions to criticise management’s approach to health and safety.</P><P>After a massive escape of gas in January 1989, on Shell’s Delta platform in the Brent field, (east of Shetland) Shell was criticised for not informing HM coastguard of the incident[116]. Independent experts believed that Shell was fortunate not to experience a disaster similar to that on Occidental’s Piper-Alpha platform.</P><P>In 1992, half of Shell exploration-and-production’s staff-management committee resigned, frustrated with the company’s attitude[117].</P><P>The union OILC which represents a large proportion of offshore workers in the British North Sea believes that nothing fundamental has changed since these incidents and that problems with health and safety are systemic. Health and safety is implemented by Shell as it is by other companies in a top down manner. Unions and workers are not adequately consulted and impossible, conflicting demands are made of employees: Work must be done, ever more quickly in the drive for ‘efficiency’ but safety must not be compromised.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

				Waves crash against a seawall along the Embarcadero in San Francisco in 2010.									<P class=""credits"">Eric Risberg / AP</P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class=""entry-content single-post-content""><P>SAN FRANCISCO — Outside a courtroom where a much-anticipated court hearing on <mark>climate</mark> science took place on Wednesday is an old photo of San Francisco’s coastline. Dated 1865, it features an area of the city known as North Beach, which back then was covered in ramshackle wooden houses on a sandy slope nuzzled up against the shore. Since then, the coastline has been extended, filled in with sand (<A href=""https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/making-up-ground/"">and most likely boats and other strange things</A>) to stretch several blocks farther into the brackish waters of the San Francisco Bay. A sea wall, <A href=""http://abc7news.com/politics/san-franciscos-cracking-seawall-needs-$250m-makeover/3235921/"">badly in need of repair</A>, keeps the bay at bay.</P><P>That very sea wall is at the heart of the court case — The People of the State of California v. BP P.L.C. et al. — that was the reason for Wednesday’s spectacle. The cities of Oakland and San Francisco are suing the five biggest fossil fuel companies on the planet — BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell — for <A href=""http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/environment/article206025399.html"">billions of dollars</A> for past damages and to prevent future flooding from sea level rise. Since the companies extracted fuel that altered the planet, the argument goes, they should pay for the consequences. It’s a modern version of “you break it, you buy it.” The oil companies have filed to dismiss the lawsuit on many grounds, including that it’s the government’s job to set and enforce <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels — not theirs.</P><P>On Wednesday, no one was yet on trial. <A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber"">U.S. District Judge William Alsup</A> made that very clear to the throng of spectators who filled the chambers, a spillover courtroom and the halls outside. Instead, we were there to see a tutorial, an effort to help this self-described “poor judge” learn the science behind the case. It was going to be a boring morning full of numbers and diagrams, he warned the audience.</P><P>But in this polarized moment, a public tussling over the basics of <mark>climate</mark> science, however cursory, is anything but boring. And as each side in the case presented a history of <mark>climate change</mark> science, it was striking just how much the two sides agreed on: <mark>Climate change</mark> is happening, and humans are in large part responsible. But that’s not really what this court case is about. Rather, it’s about who knew what and when, how much uncertainty there is around future predictions and who should be held responsible (and liable) for a future with higher seas and more extreme weather events. That’s where the cities’ and corporations’ use of evidence diverged.</P><P>First up: the scientists.</P><P>At a big rectangular table in the center of the room, the cities were represented by Steve Berman, a lawyer known for his ability to <A href=""https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43qw3j/meet-the-lawyer-trying-to-make-big-oil-pay-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">get big settlements out of big corporations</A>, as well as some of their own lawyers. But aside from a few introductory remarks, Berman left the talking to a few of the world’s leading experts on <mark>climate change</mark>. First, he called Myles Allen, who is a professor of geosystem science at Oxford University and was tasked with providing a historiography of <mark>climate change</mark> research.</P><P>In true scientist fashion, the talk was filled with jargon and complicated scientific concepts. Alsup, who made clear that he would call out confusing charts or unclear explanations, asked Allen what made <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, which is emitted from burning fossil fuels and have led to a warming planet, special. Allen, equal to the task, began to pantomime his answer. Arms stretched out to the side, fists in a ball, he shimmied left and right, showing how the charge on a <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide molecule could be unevenly distributed, absorbing the infrared waves that are naturally emitted from Earth, unlike oxygen and nitrogen, whose charge is symmetric. That infrared gets trapped within Earth’s atmosphere, instead of escaping, causing the planet to warm.</P><P>After walking through key figures and research from the last century of <mark>climate</mark> science, Allen concluded by saying that we’ve known that the planet was warming since the 1970s. And crucially, he said, we knew back then that we might not know how bad <mark>climate change</mark> would be, or be able to feel and see the effects of that warming, until it was already too late.</P><P>The next speaker, Gary Griggs, an oceanographer who works at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was deep into an explanation of sea level rise when a loud, piercing alarm went off. “Coastal flood alert,” Alsup quipped as soon as it finished. The room broke out in laughter. It wasn’t clear whether it was real or a drill, but nature has a way of making itself known.</P><P>Next up: the lawyers.</P><P>While the cities relied on scientists, the energy companies relied on lawyers. One in particular: Theodore Boutrous, a lawyer for Chevron (which is headquartered in the Bay Area) did all of the talking. And he got straight to the point, answering the question on everyone’s mind: Yes, Chevron accepts the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>. And in honor of that consensus, he’d be relying almost entirely on the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, a United Nations-backed consortium meant to provide a scientific view of what <mark>climate change</mark> is doing to the planet, to lay out his understanding of the science and the history.</P><P>He kicked off by quoting from the IPCC’s <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/"">most recent report</A>, from 2013, citing population growth and economic changes as the most important drivers of <mark>climate change</mark>. The report, he noted, says nothing about fossil-fuel extraction as a driver of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Boutrous offered a history lesson that had a lot in common with Allen’s, but with a much greater focus on the uncertainty around both the science and the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on the Bay Area. He illustrated that uncertainty in various ways, describing how theories that posited alternative roles of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere held sway through at least the 1950s. Boutros also showed how actual temperatures hadn’t been as extreme as many <mark>climate</mark> forecasts predicted in the years leading up to the report. Alsup asked if his point was that the models exaggerated the impact of humans on the <mark>climate</mark>. “Instead of doom and gloom, it’s just gloom?” he asked the lawyer. Boutrous chuckled and moved on.</P><P>Boutrous concluded by showing a map of sea level rise, saying that sea levels had fallen around San Francisco in the years leading up to the 2013 IPCC report. There’s a lot of uncertainty about the future, he concluded, noting that San Francisco and Oakland had reported that <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-municipalities-debt-disclosures-contrast-with-<mark>climate</mark>-warnings-1515456551"">exact message to bond investors</A> in 2017, when the cities said they couldn’t predict whether major flooding or storms might have a major, adverse impact on the local economy.</P><P>Finally, the tutorial pivoted back to the cities, so it pivoted back to the scientists. Don Wuebbles, who is a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois and co-wrote the 2007 IPCC report that helped the organization win the Nobel Peace Prize, was the final scientist called by the cities. He began by pointing out that he’d also led the writing of the first chapter in the 2013 IPCC report that Boutrous had so carefully recounted. “I think it’s important to recognize that science did not stop; there’s a lot we’ve learned in the last five years,” Wuebbles said. That’s why he’d be using <A href=""https://science2017.globalchange.gov/"">data from the U.S. Global Change Research Program</A>, which produces more frequent, national reports on <mark>climate change</mark> to make his presentation.</P><P>The year after the most recent IPCC report was published was the hottest on record, Wuebbles told the court. Then 2015 topped 2014, and 2016 topped 2015. Temperatures are going up, precipitation is increasing, extreme events are more frequent. Looking at a broader set of years, sea level has risen around the San Francisco Bay. Alsup asked Wuebbles whether he disagreed with Boutrous’s recounting of the science.</P><P>Not really, since the lawyer had based his presentation on the IPCC, and a report that Wuebbles was heavily involved with. But Wuebbles’s point was that the IPCC report doesn’t tell all of what we know in 2018. The IPCC report might not be wrong, but that doesn’t mean that it gives the best picture of what’s right.</P><P>As the tutorial concluded, Alsup had a few final remarks. “I wore my science tie today,” he said, pointing to the solar system hanging around his neck before standing up to leave. “I hope someone takes note of that.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV class=""mini-bio""><P>Anna Maria Barry-Jester reports on public health, food and culture for FiveThirtyEight.  <SPAN class=""twitter""><A href=""https://twitter.com/annabarryjester"" target=""_blank""><SPAN class=""twitter-username"">@annabarryjester</SPAN></A></SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class=""tags""><P class=""filed-under"">Filed under</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

      </A></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden""><DIV class=""field-items""><DIV class=""field-item even""><P>This week saw two oil companies take two very different approaches to <mark>climate change</mark>. One has recognised the impact that global efforts to cut emissions will have on its bottom line while the other denies <mark>climate</mark> action will have any adverse impact.
	I’m talking about Shell and Chevron. Both behemoths in the energy world but with drastically opposite views sitting on either side of the Atlantic.
	This week <A href=""http://www.shell.com/investors/financial-reporting/annual-publications.html#vanity-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zaGVsbC5jb20vYW5udWFscmVwb3J0"">Shell released its latest annual report</A> for the year up to December 2015. Reading through it, it quickly becomes clear that the company has started joining the dots on <mark>climate change</mark> following the <A href=""//www.desmog.co.uk/2015/12/12/historic-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-major-leap-mankind"">Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement</A> and mounting shareholder pressure.</P><P>The risk of <mark>climate change</mark> to the company is disclosed in-depth: “Rising <mark>climate change</mark> concerns have led and could lead to additional legal and/or regulatory measures which could result in project delays or cancellations, a decrease in demand for fossil fuels and additional compliance obligations, and therefore could adversely impact our costs and/or revenue.”
	It then goes on to talk about the impact increased attention to <mark>climate change</mark> across society will have on its operations, recognising that regulations on greenhouse gas emissions “will focus more on suppressing demand for fossil fuels. This could result in lower revenue.”
	This is a much clearer recognition of the risks posed by <mark>climate change</mark> to a fossil fuel company than Shell had disclosed in the past.<A href=""http://reports.shell.com/annual-report/2014/servicepages/welcome.php"">Last year</A> it stated things more simply: “Rising <mark>climate change</mark> concerns could lead to additional regulatory measures that may result in project delays and higher costs.” There was no mention of the legal risks or direct impact to the company’s profits.<STRONG>Risk Disclosure</STRONG>
	This shift in public risk disclosure is a clear recognition from Shell that policy action and legal risks are mounting. And after the past year Shell’s experienced, it’s a wise move.
	Last May, the oil company’s <A href=""//www.desmog.co.uk/2015/05/19/shell-faces-shareholder-backlash-over-arctic-drilling"">shareholders voted unanimously</A> in favour of a resolution that forced Shell to consider the possibility of a 2C world in its forecasting. Until that time Shell had been <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/17/shell-accused-of-strategy-risking-catastrophic-<mark>climate</mark>-change?CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2"">using a 4C to 6C global warming scenario</A> to guide future business operations (twice the level of warming considered safe for the planet).
	Then, in September Shell was forced to <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/28/shell-ceases-alaska-arctic-drilling-exploratory-well-oil-gas-disappoints"">abandon its plans to drill for Arctic oil</A> off the coast of Alaska citing high costs, uncertain regulatory environment, and the failure to find enough oil and gas to drill. After months of protests against Shell’s Arctic drilling, green campaigners declared this a victory for the environment.
	Finally, it’s hard to ignore the impact of the ‘Exxon knew’ campaign. Last September it was revealed that <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken"">Exxon knew that <mark>climate change</mark> was caused by humans</A> burning fossil fuels long before it went on to promote <mark>climate</mark> science denial and misinformation campaigns. Based on this, New York and California have launched investigations into the oil giant.
	And now, <A href=""http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-congress-shell-<mark>climate</mark>-change-20160218-story.html"">calls have come for a similar investigation</A> to be launched into Shell – did it also deceive the public on <mark>climate change</mark>?
	You can see how this all might push a company into acknowledging the very real financial, regulatory, and legal risks posed to it by <mark>climate change</mark>.<STRONG>Chevron's Position</STRONG>
	Meanwhile, at the other end of the spectrum Chevron is singing a different tune.
	It <A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e34575d6-e603-11e5-a09b-1f8b0d268c39.html#axzz42UQ9czMH"">told the <EM>Financial Times</EM></A> this week that the world will always need Big Oil. Rather than taking a more humble, forward-thinking approach, Chevron’s <SPAN class=""caps"">CEO</SPAN> John Watson boasted that “arguably, we’ve never been more advantaged than right now.”
	As the <EM><SPAN class=""caps"">FT</SPAN></EM>writes: “The idea that curbs on greenhouse gas emissions put the long-term viability of the oil industry at risk has been gaining ground among investors, but John Watson doubts that <mark>climate</mark> policies will be a threat to Chevron.”
	Do a quick search through <A href=""http://www.chevron.com/annualreport/2014/documents/pdf/Chevron2014AnnualReport.pdf"">Chevron’s most recent annual report for 2014</A> (presumably this year’s report for 2015 is in the works) and you’ll find that the company only mentions the words ‘<mark>climate change</mark>’ once <SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;"">–</SPAN> in the context of increased regulations on greenhouse gas emissions.
	Chevron, along with Exxon, has a reputation for not engaging on <mark>climate change</mark>. While European oil majors including Shell signed a joint declaration supporting action on <mark>climate change</mark> ahead of the Paris <SPAN class=""caps"">COP21</SPAN> <mark>climate</mark> conference in December, the two American companies were noticeable in their absence. <STRONG>Public Pressure</STRONG>
	Of course, Shell still has room for improvement – I won’t be letting it off the hook that easy.
	The joint <mark>climate</mark> declaration was <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/oil-companies-deny-that-joint-<mark>climate</mark>-pledge-is-lip-service"">criticised for being little more than hot air</A> given the industry's history of actively lobbying against <mark>climate</mark> action. <SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;"">Last April </SPAN><A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/27/shell-lobbied-to-undermine-eu-renewables-targets-documents-reveal"" style=""line-height: 17.6px;"">it was revealed</A><SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;""> that Shell successfully lobbied to undermine European renewable energy targets. Instead, it argued that Europe’s transition to a low <mark>carbon</mark> energy system should focus on gas expansion.</SPAN>
	And as Shell's annual report states, its own internal forecasting assumes an average global temperature increase of 2-3C by 2100 – this is higher than the internationally agreed target of limiting warming to “well below 2C” with the aim of achieving 1.5C. 
	In fact, at <SPAN class=""caps"">COP21</SPAN> David Hone, Shell's head of <mark>climate change</mark>, <A href=""https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/adam-ramsay/gate-crashing-inner-sanctum-of-elite-at-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-talks"">told Adam Ramsay of openDemocracy</A> that oil companies don't see holding warming of the planet to two degrees as “a given”. This view is confirmed in its report, which reads: “Based on the above analysis, we believe current oil, gas and <SPAN class=""caps""><mark>CO2</mark></SPAN> prices are too low to stimulate the fossil fuel substitution necessary to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the average global temperature increase to well below 2°C.”
	But what Shell’s recent admission does is it recognises that public pressure for action on <mark>climate change</mark> is only going to keep increasing. And, it shows that this pressure is starting to be felt at the very heart of the fossil fuel industry.

Shell already is the world's leader in liquefied natural gas.</P><P>&quot;There's no other issue with the potential to disrupt our industry on such a deep and fundamental level,&quot; van Beurden said of <mark>climate change</mark> and the need to help meet the Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord goals, even though the United States plans to split from the agreement under the Trump administration.</P><P>The emphasis goes beyond making Shell's own operations cleaner and more efficient because most of the emissions come from Shell's products after they are sold. So Shell intends to invest more in offshore wind farms, biofuels, <mark>carbon</mark> capture projects and the planting of trees and forests.</P><P><A href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/For-big-oil-<mark>climate</mark>-change-looms-large-even-in-10993607.php"">RELATED: For big oil, <mark>climate change</mark> looms large even in Trump era</A></P><P>Shell is rolling out a new program in Europe to charge about 1 or 2 cents more for gasoline to fund tree-planting projects worldwide.</P><P>&quot;Oil and gas will continue to be the core for Shell for many decades to come,&quot; van Beurden said. But they must become cleaner. &quot;We are businesses; we're not charities.&quot;</P><P>As such, Shell is planning to grow more in U.S. shale in West Texas' Permian Basin, as well as in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico on both the U.S. and Mexican sides of the Gulf.</P><P>With a growing focus on natural gas, van Beurden said Shell and other players must continue to work to reduce and eliminate methane leaks and emissions or risk having natural gas' role &quot;fatally undermined.&quot;</P><P>Last year, van Beurden said global oil demand could peak as soon as the late 2020s. He didn't back away from that Wednesday, but he said that is just one possible scenario. Oil demand could instead peak in the 2030s or even later, he said.</P><P>&quot;We ignore that at our peril.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></BODY></HTML>"

In a California courtroom on Wednesday, Chevron’s attorneys didn’t dispute the science that suggested humans, and by extension oil companies, were at least contributing to adverse <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Chevron stock holders need not hit the panic button just yet. Chevron didn’t exactly admit guilt as it pertains to its role in <mark>climate change</mark>. And, the legal argument being levied against “Big Oil” in this particular case is a bit confusing in its goal. Every little bit helps, or hurts, though, depending on which side of the table you’re sitting on.</P><H3>It’s Complicated</H3><P>The pre-trial hearing, which took place in San Francisco, didn’t determine innocence or guilt. The hearing was simply an unconventional way for litigants to decide which weapons would be allowed to be wielded in an upcoming legal battle between the five most prominent oil names and the coastal cities of San Francisco and Oakland.</P><P>They’re suing the five Big Oil icons not to stop spewing <mark>CO2</mark> into the earth’s atmosphere, but rather, to demand these energy companies <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-<mark>climate</mark>change-hearing/chevron-says-it-will-not-dispute-<mark>climate</mark>-science-in-u-s-lawsuit-idUSKBN1GX185"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">help fund the construction of a wall</A> that will keep rising ocean waters from creeping into their cities.</P><P>Chevron’s lawyers, along with attorneys representing the other top four oil names, are asking for a dismissal of the pending case. In the meantime though, none of them are denying that the plaintiff’s evidence of global warming is untrue.</P><P>The defendants are, however, still going to argue they can’t be held liable for the outcome of higher global temperatures. They all agree that only Congress (via the EPA) has jurisdiction over the fossil fuel emissions.	</P><P>The defendants added for good measure that they only provided what was being used by consumers, and that unchecked population growth exacerbated the issue.</P><H3>The Case for Chevron Stock</H3><P>It’s not a bad legal argument, truth be told. As Chevron’s written request for a dismissal <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chevron-will-stick-to-ipcc-findings-in-landmark-<mark>climate</mark>-change-trial/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">noted</A>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“This is not the first (or even the second or third) time a plaintiff has tried to plead global warming-related tort claims. Similar claims have been considered, and dismissed, by the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit, and district courts around the country.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Also weakening the plaintiff’s case is the nature of the suit itself.</P><P>It’s being filed as a nuisance suit, which generally call for the closure of a business or the removal of an annoying eyesore or noise. Not this nuisance suit though. This one is gunning for money. Richard Faulk, public-nuisance experts and counsel with Davis Wright Tremaine, commented on the matter “what we have here is a typical tort lawsuit for damages.”</P><P>The plaintiff’s attorneys aren’t exactly shooting blanks though. Along with Big Oil’s concession that <mark>climate change</mark> is real, even if their role in it has not yet been determined, the suit also claims that the likes of Exxon Mobil, BP and Chevron all funded <mark>climate change</mark> research that was ultimately intended to mislead the public about fossil fuel’s role in damage to the environment.</P><P>As San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said it, “These companies knew their products were causing sea-level rise, and they deceived people about it. Now, that bill has come due.”</P><H3>Bottom Line for Chevron Stock</H3><P>From a pure letter of the law perspective, owners of Chevron stock don’t have a great deal to worry about. At worst it would share a modest amount of liability with the rest of the oil industry, as sole causation has yet to be pegged to oil companies. And, even if it is determined, this really is an EPA matter.</P><P>The deception claims (suggesting that Big Oil paid to deceive… everyone) haven’t worked in other similar cases.</P><P>On the flipside, U.S. courtrooms are increasingly moving away from ruling based on the strictest letter of the law, and <A href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2010/08/in_defense_of_the_new_judicial_activists.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">instead making decisions grounded in a sense of fairness</A>. On the wrong day at the wrong time with a judge and jury in the wrong mood, this could end up being a blow to Big Oil.</P><P>The real risk to Chevron stock, however, goes beyond this one case. By forcing oil companies to take the small step of acknowledging that <mark>climate change</mark> science is valid now, the next step to energy companies conceding fossil fuels are a leading cause of <mark>climate change</mark> is a small one.</P><P>The <mark>climate</mark> activists’ war won’t be won with a decisive victory, but dozens and dozens of successful, progressive skirmishes.</P><P><EM>As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

And what we learned from the tutorial is that these companies are likely to use the agreed-upon science to make the case that they shouldn’t have to pay for the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P id=""JNGS92"">If the cities’ lawsuit survives a barrage of motions to dismiss, they will still have to show that oil majors deliberately sowed confusion on <mark>climate change</mark> in bad faith.Let’s walk through what we know about the various arguments so far. </P><H3 id=""9FFvBv"">Oil companies agree on the science but not the politics</H3><P id=""AWIkgM"">The fundamental argument from the oil companies is that <mark>climate change</mark> is a global problem that needs a political solution, and you can’t solve a political problem in court and you certainly can’t blame the oil companies for selling a product that everyone wants to buy. </P><P id=""BDk4p1"">Theodore Boutrous, a <A href=""https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/boutrous-jr-theodore-j/"">seasoned litigator</A> who’s argued cases before the US Supreme Court, presented on behalf of Chevron. “Chevron accepts the consensus in the scientific communities on <mark>climate change</mark>,” he said last week. “There’s no debate about <mark>climate</mark> science.”</P><P id=""hZydq0"">He built his presentation around the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>’s <A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/"">fifth assessment report</A>, published in 2013, which has more than 800 authors and cites more than 9,200 scientific papers (he also rewatched <A href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/""><EM>An Inconvenient Truth</EM></A>). The report states that the IPCC is “95 percent certain that humans are the main cause of current global warming” and remains one of the most robust works in <mark>climate</mark> science. </P><P id=""VqGdix"">But as Boutrous detailed the history of how <mark>climate</mark> scientists like Svante Arrhenius and John Tyndall developed their theories, he also noted that previous IPCC reports weren’t always so certain. The 1990 report said that “the observed increase could be largely due to natural variability.” The 1995 report said that signals were emerging that there is human influence on the <mark>climate</mark>. The 2001 report said that warming was “very unlikely” due to natural causes alone. </P><P id=""biLlp4"">The point he was making was that the consensus took time to build, and as the science got better, Chevron moved with it. Past rhetoric from oil companies reflected this uncertainty in the science, and Chevron now has a <A href=""https://www.chevron.com/corporate-responsibility/<mark>climate</mark>-change"">comprehensive strategy</A> for managing <mark>climate</mark> risks, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions. </P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>Chevron’s El Segundo Refinery covers approximately 1,000 acres with more than 1,100 miles of pipelines and is capable of refining nearly 270,000 barrels of crude oil per day.</FIGCAPTION><CITE>David McNew/Getty Images</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""H1Zi51"">Another key point Boutrous made was that these human-sourced greenhouse gas emissions are due to growing wealth and development, of which fossil fuel combustion is a symptom, not a cause. “Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever,” the IPCC reported in <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/news_and_events/docs/ar5/ar5_syr_headlines_en.pdf"">2014</A>. </P><P id=""X2JhZ3"">“It’s just a facet of human existence,” Boutrous told Vox. “It’s an issue for policymakers to address.”</P><P id=""Hx9n7I"">And looking toward the future, it’s unclear how <mark>climate change</mark> will impact San Francisco and Oakland in particular. San Francisco, in its complaint, included a map showing water inundation for the city with 66 inches of sea level rise plus 42 inches of flooding from a <A href=""https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/28/16211392/100-500-year-flood-meaning"">100-year storm</A>, a scenario they called “unlikely, but possible.”</P><P id=""XkjoUu"">Boutrous pointed out that while global sea levels are rising on average, some evidence shows that sea levels have fallen in specific regions, and coastal flooding in places like the San Francisco Bay Area is also a function of local conditions like <A href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180307141411.htm"">land subsidence</A>. </P><P id=""6ChfQj"">So for San Francisco and Oakland to build a claim on harms from future sea level rise is a stretch when there is so much uncertainty as to what will happen, the argument goes.</P><P id=""ke9AHk"">Boutrous noted that when the judge asked the scientists in the room if they disagreed with what he presented, they didn’t question his reading of the facts. </P><P id=""JqqmAq"">That signals that progress in these lawsuits isn’t going to hinge on the science so much as an untested legal theory, and that’s where the plaintiffs are on weak footing, according to Boutrous. Holding oil companies liable for producing fossil fuels would also open up cities to liability for building roads and facilitating travel with vehicles that burn those fuels. </P><P id=""0SeikJ"">“Focusing resources on a novel, never-accepted theory just isn’t the way to have a productive chance at really addressing global warming,” Boutrous said. “No tort theory has ever been developed that comes close to covering these issues.” </P><H3 id=""1FjVuh"">The <mark>climate</mark> models have gotten better; the news has gotten worse </H3><P id=""x1ezhd"">But Donald Wuebbles, an author of the 2013 IPCC report as well as the 2017 <A href=""https://science2017.globalchange.gov/"">National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment</A> produced by 13 US federal agencies, noted that while the last IPCC report may be the biggest work in <mark>climate</mark> science, it only incorporated research published as of 2012. </P><P id=""FQVBDN"">“I started up my talk saying that the science didn’t stop in 2012,” Wuebbles, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois, told Vox. “The reality is these assessments are very conservative in their statements.”</P><P id=""bLVr1X"">His end of the tutorial focused on the changes we can anticipate as average temperatures go up around the world, noting that models have become more robust and that scientists are zeroing in on the harms that will be caused by unmitigated changes to the global <mark>climate</mark>. Judge Alsup also asked him about policy questions like which energy sources the United States can use if it gives up coal, oil, and natural gas.</P><P id=""RZz3ub"">The other four defendants had representatives in the room but declined to present, which San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera read as a signal that the other oil companies did not even want to recognize that the court has jurisdiction in such a case. </P><P id=""WstLvp"">But Alsup didn’t let the other oil companies off the hook, as Debra Kahn of <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/2018/03/22/stories/1060077139"">E&amp;E News</A> noted:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P id=""ak4Jix"">Alsup ordered the other defendants in the suit — BP PLC, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell PLC</mark>, all of which had representatives at the hearing — to submit briefs within two weeks detailing any points of disagreement with Chevron. “Otherwise, I’m going to assume you’re in agreement,” he said. “You can’t get away with sitting there in silence and then later say, ‘He wasn’t speaking for us.’”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P id=""BtoyKV"">For its part, San Francisco counted the tutorial as a win.</P><P id=""ZOYPmx"">“What we saw today was one oil company begrudgingly accept the scientific consensus while trying to overemphasize the extent of scientific uncertainty,” Herrera said in a statement. “It’s time for them to pay for the seawalls and other infrastructure needed to protect San Francisco and Oakland.”</P><P id=""57ak9s"">The legal maneuvering in this case will continue, and the litigation will likely take <A href=""https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Should-oil-companies-pay-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change-Yes-12768553.php"">years</A> to resolve. Yet the fact that the lawsuits were allowed to proceed this far and that the judge has cemented the science in the courtroom means that the foundation for <mark>climate change</mark> litigation is the strongest it’s ever been. The question for the court is whether it’s strong enough to bill an oil company for a levee.</P><P id=""UOaJ2N"">UCLA’s Carlson said that the defendants will continue to file motions to dismiss the case citing different arguments — that the court doesn’t have jurisdiction in such a case, for instance, or that the defendants don’t have standing, or that federal law doesn’t provide any recourse in such a lawsuit. If none of those motions finds traction in the court, then four to six months from now, the cases move to the discovery phase, where the defendants will have to start producing documents and providing evidence. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

If you listen to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and the California mayors of San Francisco, Oakland, Richmond and others, the entire blame rests exclusively with our oil and natural gas industry. Conveniently, these money-hungry mayors and their equally greedy trial lawyers accuse only the largest, most profitable oil and natural gas companies of wrongdoing.</P><P class=""speakable"">Their municipal lawsuits allege that global warming is a local, “public nuisance” issue and the sole perpetrators of our planet’s “warming” are no farther away than the local refinery or natural gas plant. Sound unfair? Add this insane reasoning to the fact that dozens of other industrialized nations are apparently blameless for any of the planet’s <mark>climate</mark>-related woes. Operators of airlines, asphalt factories, cement plants, auto dealerships and heavy machinery in New York or California are likewise off the hook for any <mark>climate change</mark>-related issues. </P><P>These lefty mayors suggest that because the earth’s <mark>climate</mark> is changing, they might incur expenses years down the road for possible sea level rise, storms, etc., so they want our oil and natural gas producers to pay hundreds of billions in undefined damages.</P><P>A U.S. district judge in California scheduled a hearing to listen to both sides of the debate in a “tutorial” on <mark>climate change</mark>. While the energy industry presented logical facts, trial lawyers representing these liberal metropolises offered a tried-and-failed retread of legal claptrap. Importantly, the judge dismissed the notion of a conspiracy by energy companies to suppress global warming science.  Referring to one of the documents he reviewed, the judge said, “I read that paragraph 67 the same way; that there was a conspiratorial document within the defendants about how they knew good and well that global warming was right around the corner.  And I said: ‘Okay. That's going to be a big thing. I want to see it.’ Well, it turned out it wasn't quite that.”</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""pull-quote""><P class=""quote-text"">In 2011, six Midwest power companies faced the same legal nonsense. The cases were tossed by the U.S Supreme Court, with liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg writing the majority opinion in the 8-to-0 decision.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>A few years ago, several liberal state attorneys general attempted to sue Exxon for alleged damages associated with <mark>climate change</mark>, attracting fawning praise from the liberal press. But headlines often fall short of actual facts in court and in every claim, the state AG’s quietly retreated from their cases or let them fall inactive.  </P><P>In 2011, six Midwest power companies faced the same legal nonsense. The cases were tossed by the U.S Supreme Court. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in the 8-to-0 decision which ruled that American corporations cannot be sued under local “nuisance” ordinances regarding greenhouse gas emissions as the <mark>climate change</mark> issue falls under the jurisdiction of Congress and the EPA, which, according to Ginsburg, are “better equipped to do the job than individual district judges issuing ad hoc, case-by-case decisions.” Ginsburg warned that turning the jurisdiction of <mark>climate change</mark> over to local courts would create a quagmire of dissenting legal opinions across the country and allow an individual district judge to become a “super EPA.”</P><P>The truth is America should embrace its energy industry and halt these unfounded efforts to sabotage our vital energy sector. The surge of American shale oil and natural gas production has fundamentally improved the U.S. economy and led the way in lowering <mark>CO2</mark> emissions and other greenhouse gases.</P><P>In 2005, after the nation’s shale drilling revolution began, C02 emissions began to fall. U.S. energy-related <mark>carbon</mark> emissions fell 14 percent below the 2005 level in 2016, according to the U.S. <A href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.eia.gov_todayinenergy_detail.php-3Fid-3D30712&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&amp;r=dEMkuFbk9SsONdA4l8dEASNBIHqf2gAiC1OrBl6ivQY&amp;m=z4rp-mLhs1SD_XG--kefIamp35IG361-ZMLIwVbQXcI&amp;s=K_WzR-11l8tQcmmDHCyc98MqVWTQDT_9ePo_iC8I8WA&amp;e="" target=""_blank"">Energy Information Administration</A> (EIA). It wasn’t due to renewable fuels that still represent less than 5 percent of our national energy grid. Our nation’s drop in C02 emissions came as our manufacturing and energy sectors began a decisive shift toward natural gas. The market’s move to relatively clean-burning natural gas has been so profound that even if Barack Obama had never decreed the Clean Power Plan, the United States would have  already met the CPP’s <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide reduction target for 2025, according to a recent <A href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__pubs.acs.org_doi_10.1021_acs.est.8b00407&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&amp;r=dEMkuFbk9SsONdA4l8dEASNBIHqf2gAiC1OrBl6ivQY&amp;m=z4rp-mLhs1SD_XG--kefIamp35IG361-ZMLIwVbQXcI&amp;s=fh2dUCsTfp4J71RQnllkkVYctOevAtMSr2zeudP6a2s&amp;e="" target=""_blank"">Carnegie Mellon University report.</A></P><P>Our U.S. oil and gas industry has invested <A href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.eenews.net_eenewspm_2015_09_22_stories_1060025118&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&amp;r=dEMkuFbk9SsONdA4l8dEASNBIHqf2gAiC1OrBl6ivQY&amp;m=z4rp-mLhs1SD_XG--kefIamp35IG361-ZMLIwVbQXcI&amp;s=y2PT5syU9iijtx61CgxemRiI8pd_9vSOxDeB5bpGL7o&amp;e="" target=""_blank"">$90 billion</A> on emission control technologies between 2000 to 2014, according to a <A href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.lngworldnews.com_api-2Doil-2Dand-2Dgas-2Dindustry-2Dtops-2Dghg-2Dreductions_&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&amp;r=dEMkuFbk9SsONdA4l8dEASNBIHqf2gAiC1OrBl6ivQY&amp;m=z4rp-mLhs1SD_XG--kefIamp35IG361-ZMLIwVbQXcI&amp;s=UhvbItyeAuMHh3h1hg1FP7j7_ScngZldmL3ja3_loZ8&amp;e="" target=""_blank"">report by T2 and Associates</A>.

						Law360 (May 11, 2018,  3:27 PM EDT) -- The U.S. government on Thursday urged a California federal judge to toss Oakland’s and San Francisco's suits seeking to hold oil giants liable for <mark>climate change</mark>-related infrastructure damage, saying the cities' claims have no place under federal law and it's up to regulators and lawmakers to set <mark>climate</mark> and energy policy.Two days after his novel ruling that federal, not state, law governed the cities' claims that BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell promoted fossil fuel use even though they knew <mark>climate change</mark> could harm...

</FIGURE><P>SAN FRANCISCO — Lawyers for some of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, and attorneys representing two Bay Area cities are set to descend on San Francisco Wednesday for what’s expected to be a courtroom first: A daylong lesson on the latest science on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>U.S. District Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California is overseeing a public nuisance lawsuit that the cities of Oakland and San Francisco <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/403/12194/<mark>Climate</mark>-Change-Complaint.pdf"" target=""_blank"">filed last fall</A> against six fossil fuel giants: BP plc, Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips Co., Exxon Mobil Corp. and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell plc</mark>. The two waterfront cities are seeking to hold the oil companies liable for the cost of infrastructure upgrades and remediation expected as they deal with effects of rising sea levels.</P><P>In much the same way the judge does in complex technology cases, Alsup has <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/403/documents/403/12194/2018.02.27-135-Notice-re-Tutorial.pdf"">asked the parties</A> for a tutorial. Alsup held a similar session on the laser science underpinning Waymo’s autonomous vehicle trade secret lawsuit against Uber Technologies Inc. and even asked the lawyers handling the litigation challenging the Trump administration’s rollback of the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals to bring him up to speed on the program.</P><P>In the global warming case, Alsup has asked both sides to “trace the history of scientific study of <mark>climate change</mark>” and fill him in on “the best science now available.” Since his initial order asking for the tutorial late last month, Alsup has proposed some <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/403/documents/403/12194/2018.02.27-135-Notice-re-Tutorial.pdf"" target=""_blank"">more specific questions</A>. For example: “Apart from <mark>CO2</mark>, what happens to the collective heat from tail pipe exhausts, engine radiators, and all other heat from combustion of fossil fuels? How, if at all, does this collective heat contribute to warming of the atmosphere?”</P><P>The oil companies’ lengthy line-up of defense counsel filed <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/403/documents/403/12194/AS-FILED-Motion-to-Dismiss-and-Memo-2018.03.20.pdf"" target=""_blank"">a motion to dismiss</A> on Tuesday on the eve of the hearing, which argues a lawsuit is the wrong venue to address global issues like <mark>climate change</mark>. They also argued the emission of greenhouse gasses at the root of the plaintiffs claims are the sort of issue Congress has delegated to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</P><P>“At bottom, plaintiffs are trying to regulate the nationwide—indeed, worldwide—activity of companies that play a key role in virtually every sector of the global economy by supplying the fuels that enable production and <mark>innovation</mark>, literally keep the lights and heat on, power nearly every form of transportation, and form the basic materials from which innumerable consumer, technological, and medical devices are fashioned,” the companies’ lawyers wrote. “The complaints contradict numerous federal statutes and raise myriad constitutional issues.”</P><P>Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, Susman Godfrey and Stern Kilcullen &amp; Rufolo represent Chevron, Arnold &amp; Porter Kaye Scholer represent BP, King &amp; Spalding represents ConocoPhillips, O’Melveny &amp; Myers and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison represent Exxon, and Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson represent Royal Dutch Shell.</P><P>Despite the forceful arguments in the motion to dismiss, the company’s aren’t expected to quibble with the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark> and its human causes.</P><P>Gibson Dunn’s Avi Garbow, who was the EPA’s general counsel during the Obama administration, said Chevron plans to point Alsup to conclusions from the 2013 “Fifth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>,” which formed the scientific underpinning for the Paris Agreement. That includes, Garbow said, the report’s conclusion that it is “extremely likely” human influence has been the dominant cause of warming since the middle of the 20th century. Garbow said that Chevron is ”neither going to understate or overstate” the degree of confidence scientists have on their conclusions about the earth’s changing <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>Matthew Pawa, one of the cities’ outside lawyers at Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, forwarded a request for comment to the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office. In an emailed statement, City Attorney Dennis Herrera said San Francisco looks forward to presenting the science and making its case.</P><P>“We’ll see whether Big Oil acknowledges the scientific consensus and its role in causing <mark>climate change</mark> or doubles down, once again, on deception,” Herrera said. “These companies knew their products were causing sea level rise, and they deceived people about it. Now, that bill has come due.”</P></DIV><BUTTON class=""load_more_shelf btn"">Load More </BUTTON><DIV id=""share-tools-btm"" class=""col-lg-12""><DIV id=""bottom-share"" class=""share-tools text-center""><BUTTON class=""btn tw""> share on twitter</BUTTON></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""author-bio"" id=""about_the_author""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12""><H2 class=""section-title"">Ross Todd</H2></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12""><P>Ross Todd is bureau chief of The Recorder in San Francisco.

And similar efforts to go after large industries for alleged damage to the public, including cases against makers of lead paint and tobacco products, have seen mixed results in the courts.</P><P>Product-liability and public-health experts said the new <mark>climate</mark>-change cases are extremely ambitious in scope, having the potential to set wide-ranging precedent concerning financial liability for forecasted impacts of global warming.</P><P>Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they modeled their legal tactics after past efforts to hold accountable cigarette businesses, makers of cancer-causing agents and gas and chemical companies that used methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), a gasoline additive that has contaminated groundwater across the country.</P><P>While many industries have won in court and avoided costly payouts, those high-profile cases have brought negative publicity for various companies or even helped change overall public sentiment about a highlighted issue.</P><P>If Imperial Beach and the two counties prevail, household names such as <A href=""http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/topic/business/energy-resource-industries/chevron-corportion-ORCRP003149-topic.html"" title=""Chevron Corportion"">Chevron</A>, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, BP and <A id=""ORCRP013311"" title=""<mark>Royal Dutch Shell Plc</mark>"" href=""/topic/business/energy-resource-industries/gasoline-industry/royal-dutch-shell-plc-ORCRP013311-topic.html"">Royal Dutch Shell</A> could be liable for billions of dollars in mitigation costs and punitive damages in coming decades.</P><P>The leading industry groups for oil and coal conglomerates — the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Oil &amp; Gas Association — declined to comment for this story.</P><P>A decisive victory for the plaintiffs could trigger an avalanche of similar lawsuits nationwide. Other local governments could feel emboldened to sue fuel companies for a host of expenses related to global warming, including flood and storm damage, drought-related wildfires and steep increases in air-conditioning bills.</P><P>“How to deal with sea-level rise and, in particular, how to pay for it has been a growing concern for communities,” said Victor Sher, an attorney with Sher Edling LLP, a law firm that specializes in environmental cases and is representing Imperial Beach and Marin and San Mateo counties. “There’s nothing that makes this unique to California. I would not be surprised if there are other communities that are interested in this approach.”</P><P>The law firm is working on contingency. Neither the local governments involved in the <mark>climate change</mark> cases nor the law group would say who came up with the legal strategy or which group initiated the collaboration.</P><P>“We cannot discuss communications between the county and Sher Edling, including pre-litigation conversations,” said Paul Okada, chief deputy county counsel for San Mateo County. “The county and its board of supervisors have been working on sea level rise issues for years. Our office has also known and worked with Matt Edling, a county resident, for nearly a decade.”</P><P>The three new lawsuits are largely based on public nuisance law, meaning the local governments have to prove that fossil-fuel companies have caused special harm to their residents — in this case, costs associated with adapting to sea-level rise. The plaintiffs are also seeking punitive damages.</P><P>The most compelling precedent is perhaps a public nuisance lawsuit by 10 California cities and counties against several manufacturers of lead paint.</P><P>In 2014, a Santa Clara Superior Court judge order three companies — ConAgra Grocery Products, NL Industries and Sherwin-Williams — to pay a collective $1.15 billion into a fund to clean up old homes that suffered exposure to lead paint. The case was appealed and has been in the courts for 17 years now.</P><P>A similar effort involving more than half a dozen cities along the West Coast has <A href=""http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/environment/sdut-monsanto-pcbs-san-diego-bay-cleanup-gomez-lawyers-2015dec11-story.html"" target=""_blank"">taken Monsanto to court</A> to help pay for the costs of cleaning up polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, a global contaminant linked to cancer, neurological damage, thyroid problems and reproductive complications.</P><P>Such cases are largely predicated on the idea that corporations knew about the harms of their products but still sold them to continue making profits.</P><P>At the heart of the new litigation is a similar narrative that has to a certain extent been bolstered by scientific research as well as recent investigative reporting: Plaintiffs allege that executives of large oil and coal companies knew going back decades that their fossil fuels would warm up the planet — and possibly concealed that evidence. They sold their merchandise anyway and as a result, communities are today bracing for the worst consequences of chronic flooding driven by rising tides from melting glaciers, the plaintiffs said in their lawsuits.</P><P>“The notion is you have large corporations with highly developed research-and-development capacities and actual knowledge, frequently by the scientists within the organizations,” said Sher at the law firm. “They advise management and then management decides to ignore what they’re saying.”</P><P><A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken"" target=""_blank"">Reporting</A> by the nonprofit journalism group Inside <mark>Climate</mark> News and the Los Angeles Times <A href=""http://graphics.latimes.com/exxon-arctic/"" target=""_blank"">found that ExxonMobil</A> and other industry players conducted internal research going back to the 1980s that found ties between fossil fuels and <mark>climate change</mark>.</P></DIV><DIV class=""trb_ar_page"" data-role=""pagination_page"" data-content-page=""2""><P>At the same time, the state attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts have been investigating whether ExxonMobil improperly concealed this knowledge. The company has sued to block those inquiries, and that case is being heard in federal court.</P><P>Depending on how far the cases get, the world could learn substantially more about what oil and coal businesses knew and when.</P><P>To get the ball rolling, plaintiffs will have to prove that these corporations were a substantial factor in the alleged harms. This process could be trickier than it sounds, as the defendants may argue that complicity in <mark>climate change</mark> is shared globally by other large industries as well as anyone who drives a gas-powered vehicle or flies in an airplane or flips on the lights.</P><P>“The defendants can say, ‘Look, we may have emitted a bunch of (<mark>carbon</mark> dioxide), but if the only <mark>CO2</mark> in the world were ours, there’d be no global <mark>climate change</mark>, so we’re not a substantial factor,’” said Greg Keating, a professor with the University of Southern California’s Gould School of Law, who has written about <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Lawyers for Imperial Beach and Marin and San Mateo counties said they’ve gone to significant lengths to quantify the greenhouse gases they said are attributable to the fossil fuel companies in question. It could eventually be up to a jury to decide how compelling those figures are, but the quantification strategy is a key part of efforts to get judges to take the lawsuit seriously.</P><P>Specifically, they calculate that the defendants are collectively responsible for more than 20 percent of all <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and methane emitted between 1965 and 2015. This is a period in time referred to by scientists as the “great acceleration” when a fossil fuel production ramped up, accounting for roughly 75 percent of all historic emission from industry.</P><P>Because of recent advances in science, lawyers for the plaintiffs believe they can draw a convincing line from industry activities to seaside communities.</P><P>There are a whole host of other highly technical legal arguments that could hamstring the case before it even gets started. But if it clears a few key initial hurdles, the lawsuits could fundamentally restructure the way the country looks at corporate liability.</P><ASIDE class=""trb_em trb_embed "" data-content-embedlocation=""Embed + (4)"" data-content-id=""91593066"" data-content-size=""large"" data-content-type=""video"" data-content-slug=""sd-me-v-must-see-headlines"" data-content-subtype=""premiumvideo"" data-role=""sc_item  mediamanager_container  imgsize_ratiosizecontainer lightbox_container  "" data-state="""" data-embed-id=""91593066""><DIV class=""trb_em_m""><DIV class=""trb_em_r"" data-role=""lightbox_metadata""><DIV class=""trb_em_r_ca""><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Report highlights include:</P><UL><LI>A thorough review of <mark>climate</mark> science literature, including acknowledgement of fossil fuels’ dominant role in driving greenhouse gas emissions. More importantly, Shell quantifies its own products’ contribution to global <mark>CO2</mark> emissions.</LI><LI>A detailed analysis of potential <mark>climate</mark> impacts, including rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and human migration.</LI><LI>A discussion of the potential impacts to the fossil fuel sector itself, including legislation, changing public sentiment, and infrastructure vulnerabilities. Shell concludes that active engagement from the energy sector is desirable.</LI><LI>A cautious response to uncertainty in scientific models, pressing for sincere consideration of solutions even in the face of existing debates.</LI><LI>A warning to take policy action early, even before major changes are observed to the <mark>climate</mark>.</LI></UL><P>In short, by 1988 Shell was not only aware of the potential threats posed by <mark>climate change</mark>, it was open about its own role in creating the conditions for a warming world. Similar documents by ExxonMobil, oil trade associations, and utility companies have emerged in recent years, though this Shell document is a rare, early, and concrete accounting of <mark>climate</mark> responsibility by an oil major.</P><P><STRONG>Fossil fuels are driving <mark>CO2</mark> emissions</STRONG></P><P>Throughout the report, Shell acknowledges the central role of fossil fuels, and oil in particular, in increasing <mark>CO2</mark> emissions. While the authors note the uncertainties and limitations of contemporary <mark>climate</mark> models — particularly around the timing and intensity of impacts — there is little ambiguity about the responsibility of the oil industry. The report states, “Although <mark>CO2</mark> is emitted to the atmosphere through several natural processes… the main cause of increasing <mark>CO2</mark> concentrations is considered to be fossil fuel burning.”</P><P>Later, the authors quantify Shell’s products’ unique contribution to global <mark>CO2</mark> emissions by segment. According to this internal analysis, Shell’s products (oil, gas, and coal) were responsible for 4% of total global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions in 1984. This is one of the earliest examples of <mark>carbon</mark> accounting by an oil major, and consistent with Richard Heede’s “<A href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-pvpXB8rp67dmhmsueWaUczHS5XyPy4p/view?usp=sharing""><mark>Carbon</mark> Majors</A>” methodology of tracing <mark>carbon</mark> responsibility back to the producers.</P><P><STRONG><mark>Climate change</mark> could have costly and significant impacts</STRONG></P><P>The report states that <mark>climate</mark> impacts could include “significant changes in sea level, ocean currents, precipitation patterns, regional temperature and weather.” It also states changes would impact “the human environment, future living standards and food supplies, and could have major social, economic and political consequences.”</P><P>Shell’s authors detail additional, specific impacts including the abandonment of cities and countries in low-lying areas (e.g. Bangladesh) and coral reef destruction, concluding these environmental and socio-economic changes may be the “greatest in human history.”</P><P>Shell’s analysis draws on much of the best available scientific research of the time, detailed in a lengthy appendix. The authors also include details of a report Shell commissioned from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at University of East Anglia in 1981. The research was later extended for Department of Energy and published by the U.S. government in 1984. Shell’s relationship with CRU and Director Wigley continued until at least 1985.</P><P><STRONG>Fossil fuel companies will be directly impacted</STRONG></P><P>No surprise, Shell examines the physical, financial, and political impacts of a warming world to its own business. It notes the risk of legislation and “changing demand for our products,” as well as new business opportunities in alternative fuels. Shell also anticipates the “environmental problem” forcing a policy response, the need for international government action, and the reputational risk of “political anxiety.” It’s up to investors to assess if these and other risks were adequately disclosed in subsequent years.</P><P>In light of these “strong stakes,” the authors advise active engagement from the energy sector in discussions of policy and programs.</P><P><STRONG>Uncertainty is not cause for delay</STRONG></P><P>Shell notes the existing uncertainty in <mark>climate</mark> models, recognizing that while some impacts are unavoidable, the relative timing, severity, and geographic distribution of global warming requires further research and observation. Nonetheless, Shell does not advocate delaying robust consideration of possible solutions until impacts are observed. In Shell’s own words:</P><P>“With very long time scales involved, it would be tempting for society to wait until then to begin doing anything. The potential implications for the world are, however, so large, that policy options need to be considered much earlier. And the energy industry needs to consider how it should play its part.”</P><P>Interested in more Shell documents?

They also worked for Shell Oil Co.</P><P>In 1998, Shell researchers wrote an internal <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/assets/2018/04/05/document_cw_02.pdf"" target=""_blank"">memo</A> about future scenarios that could harm their business. They determined that “only a crisis can lead to a large-scale change in this world,” according to the memo, recently <A href=""https://decorrespondent.nl/5563/shellknew-in-deze-interne-documenten-kun-je-zelf-lezen-wat-shell-sinds-1986-weet-over-klimaatverandering/613092667-fad068b1"" target=""_blank"">uncovered</A> by <EM>De Correspondent</EM> with a trove of company documents.</P><P>The scenario planning process was based on <mark>climate</mark> science, political realities and economic projections. It suggested that a major storm on the East Coast in 2010 could turn public opinion against Shell and other oil and gas conglomerates, while pushing governments toward strict environmental regulations and investments in renewable energy.</P><P>“Following the storms, a coalition of environmental [nongovernmental organizations] brings a class-action suit against the US government and fossil-fuel companies on the grounds of neglecting what scientists (including their own) have been saying for years: that something must be done,” the Shell researchers wrote. “A social reaction to the use of fossil fuels grow, and individuals become ’vigilante environmentalists’ in the same way, a generation earlier, they had become fiercely anti-tobacco. Direct-action campaigns against companies escalate. Young consumers, especially, demand action.”</P><P>They came close to predicting Superstorm Sandy, which devastated the East Coast in 2012, killing at least 147 people and causing more than $70 billion in economic damages. The storm hit particularly hard in New York City, inspiring Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to undertake aggressive <mark>climate</mark> policies. Other states followed. Earlier this year, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio sued Shell and four other major oil companies as a way to make them “take full responsibility for the <mark>devastation</mark> they have wrought” for contributing to <mark>climate change</mark>. Separately, other parties are suing the federal government for promoting oil and gas consumption in a period of rising temperatures.</P><P>The revelations about Shell’s internal deliberations on <mark>climate change</mark> were contained in a series of Shell documents obtained by <EM>De Correspondent</EM>, an online investigative news outlet based in Europe, and shared with E&amp;E News. The documents, published online by <mark>Climate</mark> Files, show that Shell has long recognized that fossil fuels contribute to <mark>climate change</mark>. The disclosure comes as Shell and other oil companies are being sued by California municipalities for exacerbating sea-level rise.</P><P>A Shell spokesman declined to confirm or deny the authenticity of the documents.</P><P>According to the documents, Shell recognized in the 1980s that it played a role in global warming and that the threat from rising temperatures was growing. The research determined that the company generated 4 percent of the world’s <mark>carbon</mark> emissions in 1984, from its production of oil, gas and coal. In a 1988 internal <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/assets/2018/04/05/document_cw_03.pdf"" target=""_blank"">report</A>, marked “Confidential,” Shell researchers noted that “the main cause of increasing <mark>CO2</mark> concentrations is considered to be fossil fuel burning.” By 1988, internal deliberations showed that Shell believed the energy industry had a role to play in <mark>climate policy</mark>.</P><P>“With very long time scales involved, it would be tempting for society to wait until then to begin doing anything,” said the 1988 document. “The potential implications for the world are, however, so large, that policy options need to be considered much earlier. And the energy industry needs to consider how it should play its part.”</P><H2>Skepticism and masquerades</H2><P>In recent years, <mark>Royal Dutch Shell PLC</mark>, as it’s known now, has taken a relatively aggressive stance toward recognizing <mark>climate change</mark> compared with other oil companies. Last year, the company said it wanted to cut its <mark>carbon</mark> emissions in half by 2050 and increase its investment in renewables. Last month, it released a report, called the “Sky” scenario, that envisions a world of net-zero <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by 2070.</P><P>Like other energy companies, Shell also has been a member of lobbying and trade groups that promote <mark>climate</mark> skepticism and oppose <mark>climate policy</mark>, including in recent years. The company was part of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a group that raised doubt about mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science, until 2015. Shell rescinded its membership because of the organization’s position on <mark>climate</mark> science. In the 1990s, as world leaders were crafting some of the first international <mark>climate</mark> agreements, Shell joined the Global <mark>Climate</mark> Coalition, an industry group that battled against <mark>climate policy</mark>. Shell also backed the American Petroleum Institute, which had a coordinated campaign in the 1990s to sow public doubt about <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Shell has a long history of recognizing <mark>climate</mark> risks, said a Shell spokesman. The company supported the Paris Agreement and other efforts to transition to a lower-<mark>carbon</mark> future while also increasing energy access, he said.</P><P>“Successfully navigating this dual challenge requires sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-<mark>carbon</mark> choices for businesses and consumers,” the Shell spokesman said in a statement. “It requires cooperation between all segments of society, not lawsuits that masquerade as <mark>climate</mark> action and impede the collaboration needed for meaningful change. Cities can be powerful drivers of positive change in the energy transition, but filing lawsuits against the producers of energy that drives the world’s economy, raises living standards and improves lives, is not the answer.”</P><P>While Shell has a different track record from other oil companies, like Exxon Mobil Corp., the documents show its carefully crafted public persona was different behind closed doors, said Carroll Muffett, president of the Center for International Environmental Law. He said the documents show that Shell officials began homing in on uncertainty in <mark>climate</mark> science even as company leaders spoke about the need to recognize <mark>climate</mark> risks.</P><P>“It would put out public statements acknowledging that there were risks of <mark>climate change</mark>, yet these documents demonstrate that it was simultaneously putting together much more sophisticated talking points to take into negotiations into smaller meeting rooms where it was emphasizing much more clearly all of the key points of uncertainty,” Muffett said.</P><P>The company used stark language to track the troubling implications of a world that was warming through the use of its products. Researchers said the rate of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere, especially when combined with other pollutants such as ozone and methane, could push global temperatures up by 1.5 to 3.5 degrees Celsius. At that time, they estimated that a real increase in global temperatures could be detectable early this century. In fact, almost all of the years since 2000 have been among the warmest ever recorded.</P><P>“By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even to stabilize the situation,” one document says.</P><P>Taken together, the documents show that Shell had a sweeping view of <mark>climate change</mark> risks decades ago, before most of the general public was aware that it existed. In fact, much of the company’s <mark>climate</mark> research and dire findings have already been proved correct. Thirty years ago, the company identified risks related to sea-level rise, changes in ocean currents and precipitation patterns, all of which has been documented in the years since. The company also understood that <mark>climate change</mark> could pose major social, economic and political consequences, particularly in low-lying areas. The documents determined that such changes could be the “greatest in human history.”</P><P>The reports and memos also highlighted scientific uncertainty around <mark>climate change</mark> at a time when world leaders were crafting international agreements to regulate <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. A film produced by Shell in 1991, called “<mark>Climate</mark> of Concern,” declared that “waiting for ironclad proof would be irresponsible.” But a 1994 document, which was not marked confidential, focused on the arguments of <mark>climate</mark> skeptics and questioned <mark>climate</mark> models. It suggested that policymakers, who could use regulations to cut into the company’s profits, should focus on weaknesses in <mark>climate</mark> science.</P><P>“It is thus not possible to dismiss the global warming hypothesis as scientifically unsound; on the other hand any policy measure should take into account explicitly the weakness in the scientific case,” they wrote.</P><H2>‘Major business implications’</H2><P>Other energy companies also recognized the dangers of <mark>climate change</mark> decades ago, well before most of the public was aware of the issue. <EM>Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News</EM> and the <EM>Los Angeles Times</EM> revealed in 2015 that Exxon researchers had known the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> since the 1970s. Their reporting has sparked an ongoing environmental campaign, called Exxon Knew, and led to an investigation by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, both Democrats, about whether the company misled investors on <mark>climate</mark> risks.</P><P>The newest revelations show that Shell had extensive research into <mark>climate change</mark> for about the same amount of time. The release of the documents could influence the lawsuits filed by eight cities and counties against oil companies for contributing to sea-level rise, said Ann Carlson, co-director of the UCLA School of Law’s Emmett Institute on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the Environment.</P><P>Information revealed in the documents about Shell’s global contribution of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions could be used against the company, she said.</P><P>“When you start getting real percentages of total global emissions from some years going forward, that paints a much more devastating picture about what the defendants knew,” Carlson said. “It’s easier for the defendants to say, ‘Oh yeah, we can hold you guys responsible, you caused a big part of the problem’ and they don’t have to pay all of it, but they have to pay their share.”</P><P>While the documents show that company officials had an awareness that <mark>climate change</mark> could cause disruptions to life on the planet, researchers were also focused on how an increase in <mark>climate</mark> regulation could eventually cut into their bottom line.</P><P>“The threat of <mark>climate change</mark> remains the environmental concern with by far the greatest significance for the fossil fuel industry, having major business implications,” researchers wrote in a 1994 company <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/assets/2018/04/05/document_cw_04.pdf"" target=""_blank"">report</A> titled “The Enhanced Greenhouse Effect.”</P><P>The documents show that Shell was unwilling to position itself to address the risks it was grappling with internally and instead chose to embrace uncertainty in science, said Peter Frumhoff, director of science and policy and chief <mark>climate</mark> scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. He said the solution Shell has drawn on is that the world needs more oil and gas, not that the findings laid out in the internal documents require additional investments into other forms of energy.</P><P>“There is still a reluctance, even to this day, to lay out a plan to say, ‘Here’s what we’re going to do to get to net zero emissions, because we know it’s necessary and we want policies in place that support that,’” Frumhoff said. “So they’re still hedging their bets, despite the fact that they knew more than 40 years ago of the serious risks and internally recognized the need for action in a precautionary sense that is obviously a hell of a lot more urgent today.”</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>wire with permission from E&amp;E News.

But it was welcomed by those who knew that Van Beurden was no fluffy liberal. “<A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f9517af6-b986-11e3-957a-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2Ff9517af6-b986-11e3-957a-00144feabdc0.html%3Fsiteedition%3Duk&amp;siteedition=uk&amp;_i_referer=#axzz3ZA4W9Irm"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Follow the money</A>,” was his mantra during a stint at Shell’s chemicals division, according to one colleague.

The powerful ranks of oil and gas industry executives had not witnessed a Damascene moment.

Referring to the internationally agreed limit on a global temperature rise of 2C, the document states: “Both our scenarios and the IEA (International Energy Agency) New Policies scenario (and our base case energy demand and outlook) do not limit emissions to be consistent with the back-calculated 450 parts per million (<mark>CO2</mark> in the atmosphere) 2C.

Desertification of parts of the globe would force agriculture on to untouched areas of the planet, while populations would have to adapt to rising sea levels, extreme weather and increasing levels of agricultural pests and diseases, according to a collection of papers published by the Royal Society in 2010.</P><P>Meanwhile, a recent, seismic corporate event put even greater distance between Van Beurden’s words and reality. On 8 April Shell’s chief executive shocked the industry by announcing the <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/08/shell-bg-group-47bn-takeover-oil-industry"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">acquisition of BG Group</A>, the former exploration arm of British Gas, now one of the world’s biggest gas producers. Having warned industry colleagues about the discredited trade-off between jobs and the environment, Van Beurden put growth first in emphatic fashion. The BG deal is the biggest takeover in the company’s history and it clearly propels Shell deeper into fossil fuel extraction.</P><P>Putting the two businesses together makes a growing <mark>carbon</mark> footprint even bigger. <A href=""http://reports.shell.com/sustainability-report/2014/our-performance/environment/air-emissions.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Shell’s direct greenhouse gas emissions from facilities</A> were 76m tonnes on a <mark>CO2</mark>-equivalent basis in 2014, up 4% from 73m tonnes 12 months earlier.

If regulators let the new partnership proceed, Shell will be increasing its oil and gas reserves by 25%, raising production by 20% and employing almost 100,000 staff. This would be a big boost given that Shell, which in its early incarnation nearly a century ago boasted of producing 11% of the world’s oil, has struggled to find its own oil and gas reserves through the drill bit. Fadel Gheit, the highly respectedindustry analyst, described the transaction as “one of the best deals the industry has ever seen”.</P><P>But <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/08/shell-takeover-of-bg-what-the-analysts-say"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Pascal Menges, manager of the Lombard Odier Global Energy Fund</A>, which invests in the energy sector, sees failure as the driving motive behind the deal. “This shows that big oil’s growth strategy over the last 10 years is bust,” he argued. “Having bet enormous sums on eye-wateringly expensive oil production from oil sands, ultra-deep water and Arctic fields, the super majors are now ill-placed to cope with a low oil price,” he said, although oil had recently recovered from a perilous low of less than $50 per barrel this year – a price which makes profitable oil and gas exploration very difficult – to around $65.</P><FIGURE itemprop=""associatedMedia image"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/ImageObject"" data-component=""image"" class=""element element-image img--landscape element--supporting  fig--narrow-caption fig--has-shares "" data-media-id=""a43fd685bfc228e4ca20e8d2368d2065341863ea"" id=""img-3""><DIV class=""block-share block-share--article  hide-on-mobile "" data-link-name=""block share""><A class=""rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link"" href=""http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=The%20real%20story%20behind%20Shell%27s%20<mark>climate</mark>%20change%20rhetoric&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2F2015%2Fmay%2F17%2Fshell-<mark>climate</mark>-change-rhetoric-the-real-story%3Fpage%3Dwith%3Aimg-3%23img-3&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F15%2F1431703950417%2Fb599a5b9-92c0-4cd2-9ba6-37defe05c560-2060x1236.jpeg"" target=""_blank"" data-link-name=""social pinterest""><SPAN class=""u-h"">Pinterest</SPAN></A></DIV><FIGCAPTION class=""caption caption--img caption caption--img"" itemprop=""description""> Ben van Beurden, left, shakes hands with Andrew Gould, chairman of BG Group Plc, after Shell agreed to buy BG Group.

</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Menges also highlighted a trend pushing Shell into exploring difficult parts of the world – such as the Canadian tar sands, Nigeria, and deep water off Brazil and the US Gulf (underlined by the US government’s controversial decision on 11 May to allow <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/11/shell-arctic-drilling-alaska-oil-gas"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Shell to restart drilling in the Arctic,</A> off the coast of Alaska).</P><P>Shell has either taken most accessible oil and gas fields or had its path blocked by states engaged in resource nationalism – governments giving licences to state-owned companies at the expense of foreign multinationals.</P><P>Shell is upfront that its takeover of BG is about profit and capability.</P><P>A spokeswoman said: “By combining BG’s portfolio and skills set with Shell’s capabilities we can deliver a step change in the growth priorities for both of our companies. This means more deep water and more LNG [liquefied natural gas] plays where we have strong profitability and capabilities.”</P><P>This retreat to some of the most inaccessible and technically challenging oil and gas fields in the world poses, however, a further threat to Shell: the possibility of these projects being forcibly mothballed if there is global action to head off a rise of more than 2C.</P><P><A href=""http://www.<mark>carbon</mark>tracker.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CTI-Oil-Report-Oil-May-2014-13-05.pdf"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Research from <mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker</A>, a <mark>climate change</mark> thinktank, highlights all these areas – the Canadian tar sands, the US Gulf and Alaska – as being at the highest risk from enforced mothballing and becoming “stranded assets” tying up billions of pounds worth of shareholder funds.</P><P>This analysis was given further weight by a study for the Norwegian government by the industry consultancy Rystad Energy. <A href=""http://www.rystadenergy.com/AboutUs/NewsCenter/PressReleases/<mark>climate</mark>-report-for-ministry-of-the-environment"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">It concluded</A> that even if the world managed to remain within the 2C limit the “largest stranded areas are offshore North and South America, west Africa and in the Arctic”.</P><FIGURE class=""element element-interactive interactive element--supporting"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2015/03/<mark>climate</mark>-embeds/campaign-form/update/promos/campaign-embed-form.html"" data-alt=""<mark>Climate</mark> campaign sign up""><A href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2015/03/<mark>climate</mark>-embeds/campaign-form/update/promos/campaign-embed-form.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""><mark>Climate</mark> campaign sign up</A></FIGURE><P>The BG Group deal gives Shell a significant stake in one of the most technically challenging – not to mention potentially stranded – deep water projects in the world. In the previous decade Brazil made a mammoth oil discovery off its Atlantic coast and Shell inherited BG’s investments in those fields. The fields off Brazil are at depths of 2,100 metres (7,000 ft) compared with the 1,500 metres that BP was operating in when its Deepwater Horizon rig blew up in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 during a drilling operation. Deep water is expensive to operate in and, as BP found out, an environment where the consequences of serious accidents are harder to manage.</P><P>But Van Beurden rejects the stranded asset argument for Shell. In <A href=""http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/media/speeches-and-articles/2014/working-together-lower-<mark>carbon</mark>-higher-energy.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">a speech</A> to Columbia University, in New York, last September, he said: “In our opinion, the ‘stranded assets’ thesis underestimates the significance of rising energy demand. It underplays the role natural gas will perform in the global energy system, especially in replacing coal power plants. And it ignores the potential of <mark>innovation</mark>s like <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage.”</P><P>With Shell’s involvement in such controversial areas there is also scrutiny of its lobbying efforts. The Union of Concerned Scientists in the US has started a campaign against Shell over its continued involvement in the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), a rightwing nonprofit organisation that has been criticised for drafting model legislation that denies any human contribution to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>While companies such as Occidental Petroleum and Google have left Alec – Google’s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, alleged last year “<A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/23/google-to-cut-ties-with-rightwing-lobby-group-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change-lies"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">they’re just literally lying</A>” about <mark>climate change</mark> – Shell argues that it supports the organisation because it promotes job creation and the free market.</P><P>In a statement, it said: “We are members of Alec and several other similar groups across the political spectrum that foster bipartisan exchanges between elected officials. In terms of Alec, we specifically support their pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda and generally find commonality on issues important to the oil and gas industry.</P><P>“While there are some issues on which we have different views, we look at the totality of the organisation not a single issue. This is the case with other organisations as well.”</P><P>Some critics say the “responsible image” of Shell moving into a cleaner gas sector via the BG deal masks a fossil fuel company struggling for survival in a world facing <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“This is not an evil guy leading the world to destruction. He is just leading a company that is trying to find a way of maintaining this [fossil fuels] system,” said Ike Teuling, energy campaigner with Friends of the Earth Netherlands.</P><P>Fittingly for a pragmatic Dutchman, There is considerable latitude in Van Beurden’s stance on <mark>climate change</mark>. He argues that global warming is a significant issue that needs tackling but not in a way that distracts attention away from the reality of growing population, increasing prosperity and growing energy demand.</P><P>“Today, three billion people still lack access to the modern energy many of us take for granted,” he said. “This isn’t just about having a dustbuster or a TV set. <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Energy</A> access often makes the difference between poverty and prosperity. At the same time, demand is growing. There will be more people on this planet, more people living in cities and more people rising from poverty. They will all need energy if they are to thrive. The issue is how to balance one moral obligation, energy access for all, against the other: fighting <mark>climate change</mark>.”.</P><P>This allows Van Beurden to indicate that fossil fuel critics are largely based in the largely prosperous west and are denying prosperity to those developing countries such as China and India who need oil and gas energy to become more prosperous themselves.</P><P>Included in Van Beurden’s industry speech in that hotel ballroom there were excerpts that endorsed the status quo. “Yes, <mark>climate change</mark> is real. And yes, renewables are an indispensable part of the future energy mix. But no, provoking a sudden death of fossil fuels isn’t a plausible plan,” he suggested.</P><P>Nothing in Shell’s current strategy suggests Van Beurden is going to present a plausible alternative.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

All of the defendants joined in a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, in which they reiterated arguments from their March 20 motion to dismiss the original complaint: that federal common law claims were either displaced by federal statutes or were “plainly improper”; that the plaintiffs failed to allege the elements of a nuisance claim; and that even if the plaintiffs pleaded a viable claim, judicial resolution would be inappropriate because it would violate separation of powers. Each defendant other than Chevron Corporation also filed a new motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell plc</mark> (Shell) again also sought dismissal on the basis of insufficient service of process. The defendants addressed four questions that the court on March 27 had requested be addressed in the briefing on the motion to dismiss. They said they were aware of no cases sustaining a nuisance theory of liability based on the otherwise lawful sale of a product where the seller finance or sponsored research or advertising intended to cast doubt on studies showing that use of the product was harmful. They also told the court that “no global-warming-based nuisance claim has ever made it past the pleadings,” argued that the plaintiffs sought to hold them liable for speech “plainly immunized” by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, and asserted that the plaintiffs’ “expansive theory of liability has no limiting principle.” The plaintiffs’ response to the motions to dismiss was due by May 3, and defendants’ replies were due by May 10. The court had also set a deadline of May 10 for the United States to submit an amicus brief if it wished to do so. A hearing on the motions to dismiss was scheduled for May 24. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/19/2018</TD><TD>Motion to dismiss first amended complaints for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by BP p.l.c.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/18/2018</TD><TD>Motion filed by United States for extension of time to consider whether to participate as amicus curiae.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/18/2018</TD><TD>Order issued setting deadline of May 10, 2018 for United States to file amicus brief.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/04/2018</TD><TD>Redlined first amended complaint filed by plaintiffs (San Francisco).</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/04/2018</TD><TD>Redlined first amended complaint filed by plaintiffs (Oakland).</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/04/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180404_docket-317-cv-06011_order-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Order issued setting schedules for motions to dismiss amended complaint.</TD><TD>The court deemed the March 20 motions to dismiss withdrawn, and new motions to dismiss the amended complaints are due on April 19.

The five named defendants joined in a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. First, they argued that Congress had displaced federal common law claims based on domestic activities, whether those activities involved combustion of fossil fuels (in which case the Clean Air Act displaced federal common law) or production and promotion of fossil fuels (in which case “many federal statutes … expressly regulate (and, in fact, encourage) such conduct)). The defendants also argued that federal common law principles would not support recognition of a claim based on the defendants’ foreign activities. Second, the fossil fuel companies argued that elements of a federal common law claim for public nuisance were absent. The defendants asserted (1) that the plaintiffs had not alleged and could not allege that the defendants’ conduct was unauthorized by law; (2) that it was undisputed that the defendants did not control the fossil fuels at the time of the alleged creation of the nuisance (i.e., the time of combustion); (3) that the complaint’s allegations did not establish causation, since the claims depended “on an attenuated causal chain including billions of intervening third parties—i.e., fossil fuel users like Plaintiffs themselves—and complex environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades”; and (4) that the damages sought by the plaintiffs in the form of an “abatement fund” could not be awarded because plaintiffs had not alleged actual harm, only “speculative future harms that may never eventuate.” The defendants also argued that damages would violate the defendants’ due process and First Amendment rights. Finally, the defendants asserted that judicial relief would violate separation of powers by invading the executive branch’s authority to conduct foreign affairs and legislative authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180320_docket-317-cv-06011_motion-to-dismiss-2.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by ConocoPhillips Company.</TD><TD>Four of the defendants filed separate motions to dismiss on personal jurisdiction grounds, arguing that the court could not exercise either general jurisdiction over the companies—two of which were non-U.S. companies and two of which were headquartered in Texas and incorporated in other states (one in New Jersey, one in Delaware)—or specific jurisdiction based on the companies’ alleged activities in and contacts with California. <mark>Royal Dutch Shell plc</mark> also asserted that the complaint should be dismissed against it for insufficient service of process.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by Exxon Mobil Corporation.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by BP p.l.c.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, insufficient service of process, and failure to state a claim filed by <mark>Royal Dutch Shell plc</mark>.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Response filed by Happer, Koonin, and Lindzen to court's request for information re amicus curiae materials.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Responses filed by Viscount Monckton of Brenchley et al. to court's request for information re amicus curiae materials.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Plaintiffs filed response to motions to file amicus curiae brief and tutorial presentation and statement of nonopposition.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Stipulation and order issued regarding formatting for briefing of motions to dismiss.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/19/2018</TD><TD>Administrative motion for leave to submit presentation in response to the court's tutorial questions filed by William Happer, Steven E.

Connecticut; Requested “Tutorial” on <mark>Climate Change</mark>.</STRONG> The federal district court for the Northern District of California denied Oakland’s and San Francisco’s motions to remand their <mark>climate change</mark> public nuisance lawsuits against five major fossil fuel producers to state court. The court held that federal common law necessarily governed the nuisance claims because “[a] patchwork of fifty different answers to the same fundamental global issue would be unworkable” and “the extent of any judicial relief should be uniform across our nation.” The court stated: “Plaintiffs’ claims for public nuisance, though pled as state-law claims, depend on a global complex of geophysical cause and effect involving all nations of the planet (and the oceans and atmosphere). It necessarily involves the relationships between the United States and all other nations. It demands to be governed by as universal a rule of apportioning responsibility as is available.” The court dispensed with the cities’ three primary arguments for remanding the cases. First, the court said the cities’ novel theories of liability based on the defendants’ sales of their product did not differentiate their claims from earlier transboundary <mark>pollution</mark> suits in which the Supreme Court (American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut) and Ninth Circuit (Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp.) applied federal common law. Second, the court said the Clean Air Act did not displace the plaintiffs’ federal common law claims, allowing state law to govern; the court said that while the Clean Air Act spoke directly to the “domestic emissions” issues presented in American Electric Power and Kivalina, “[h]ere, the Clean Air Act does not provide a sufficient legislative solution to the nuisance alleged to warrant a conclusion that this legislation has occupied the field to the exclusion of federal common law.” Third, the court said the well-pleaded complaint rule did not bar removal. The court also indicated in dicta that “the very instrumentality of plaintiffs’ alleged injury — the flooding of coastal lands — is, by definition, the navigable waters of the United States. Plaintiffs’ claims therefore necessarily implicate an area quintessentially within the province of the federal courts.” The court said defendants had not waived this issue. The court certified the decision for interlocutory appeal, finding that the issue of whether the nuisance claims were removable because such claims are governed by federal common law was a controlling question as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that resolution by the court of appeals would materially advance the litigation. The court’s order also noted that six similar actions brought by other California municipalities were pending before another judge in the district and those actions asserted additional non-nuisance claims. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/19/2018</TD><TD>Defendants' reply to plaintiffs' supplemental brief on navigable waters of the United States filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/19/2018</TD><TD>Plaintiffs' supplemental reply brief on navigable waters of the United States filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/16/2018</TD><TD>Defendants' response to request for supplemental briefing filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/16/2018</TD><TD>Plaintiffs' supplemental brief on navigable waters of the United States filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/12/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180212_docket-317-cv-06011_request-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Request for supplemental briefing issued.</TD><TD><STRONG>Federal Court in Oakland and California <mark>Climate Change</mark> Suits Against Fossil Fuel Producers Asked for Additional Briefing on Navigable Waters Issue.</STRONG> The federal district court for the Northern District of California considering whether to remand Oakland and San Francisco's <mark>climate change</mark> lawsuits against fossil fuel producers issued a request for supplemental briefing on the issue of how the concept of “navigable waters of the United States” related to removal jurisdiction.

The parties completed their briefing on the remand motion on January 15, 2018. In their reply in support of remand, the city attorneys asserted that the defendants’ assertions of federal jurisdiction “would federalize vast areas of traditional state law.” They emphasized that they did not seek to limit anyone’s emissions and that the only remedy sought was an “abatement fund” to shift adaptation costs from the public to the fossil fuel companies. The city attorneys also argued that the argument that the cases arose under federal law suffered from the “fatal defect” that they relied on “ordinary preemption doctrines” that did not provide a basis for removal.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>12/19/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20171219_docket-317-cv-06011_opposition-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Joint opposition to motion to remand filed by defendants.</TD><TD>In their opposition to the remand motion, the defendants asserted that the cases “implicate longstanding federal government policies, concerning matters of uniquely national importance, including the Nation’s supply of energy and the global environment” and argued that the plaintiffs’ actions necessarily were governed by federal common law and necessarily raised federal questions by seeking “to supplant federal domestic and foreigh policy on greenhouse gas emissions to hold a handful of energy producers liable for the alleged consequences of rising ocean levels on a discrete portion of the U.S. coast.” The defendants also argued that the Clean Air Act completely preempted the actions because the statute “provides the exclusive cause of action for regulation of nationwide emissions.” The defendants also reiterated their arguments that the actions were removable because they were based on the defendants’ activities on federal lands and at the direction of the federal government, and because the claims would have an impact on a number of bankruptcy proceedings, not just Texaco’s, and because exemptions from bankruptcy jurisdiction for governmental exercises of police power were construed narrowly. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>12/14/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20171214_docket-317-cv-06011_complaint.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Third-party complaint filed by Chevron Corp.</TD><TD>Chevron Corporation filed a third-party complaint against Statoil ASA—an energy company of which the Norwegian State is majority stakeholder—for indemnity and contribution.

ExxonMobil Corp. that all tort claims related to global warming were governed by federal common law. The city attorneys also asserted that none of the other theories in the defendants’ “kitchen-sink notices of removal” had merit: the plaintiffs argued that that their claim to relief did not necessarily raise a substantial and disputed federal issue and also asserted that no court had held that the Clean Air Act completely preempted state common law public nuisance claims. The plaintiffs also said that the fact that “some unspecified portion of [the defendants’] oil and gas production occurs on federal land” did not provide a basis for removal under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act or under a “federal officer” or “federal enclave” theory of removal.

Others, however, contend that the conversation on <mark>climate</mark> has shifted away from hard-liners, with a growing number of Republicans and conservatives embracing clean technology and <mark>climate</mark> science, according to several of the group's members.</P><P>&quot;I think the attention they got on energy and environmental issues was so intense that that's where they focused on their outreach with the center-left,&quot; said Paul Blair, director of strategic initiatives with Americans for Tax Reform and a member of ALEC. &quot;You can't pass the laugh test with going center-left on tax issues. To me, you can't pass the laugh test with me by going center-left on energy and environment issues. But they apparently think they can.&quot;</P><P>It's a fight that reflects the broader conservative debate over <mark>climate change</mark> and the direction of the Republican Party during the Trump administration.</P><P>And it will soon come to a head, as ALEC members prepare to vote on a measure that takes aim at U.S. EPA's endangerment finding on greenhouse gases. The Obama-era finding is a compilation of scientific evidence that forms the legal basis for EPA greenhouse gas regulations. It's despised by many conservatives.</P><SECTION class=""ad medium""><P class=""label"">Advertisement</P></SECTION><P>ALEC's Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force is slated to vote on a draft <A href=""https://www.alec.org/model-policy/resolution-calling-for-epa-review-of-the-2009-endangerment-finding-for-greenhouse-gases/"">resolution</A> at a meeting in Nashville, Tenn., next month that calls &quot;upon the Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw the 2009 endangerment finding for <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and other greenhouse gases and conduct a new rulemaking on this issue.&quot;</P><P>If ALEC ultimately adopts the resolution, it will serve as a model resolution for state and federal lawmakers to express their disdain for the EPA finding. The vote will put big businesses and trade groups that sit on the ALEC task force on the spot regarding whether the endangerment finding is worth investigating.</P><P>&quot;Robust debate comes from stakeholders engaging from a variety of perspectives. And that is precisely what's happening here,&quot; said ALEC spokesman Bill Meierling. He noted that the draft resolution could be amended or changed when the task force meets in Nashville.</P><P>The tug of war at ALEC mirrors the fight between voices skeptical of mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science — like the nonprofit Heartland Institute — and groups that are more moderate on <mark>climate change</mark>, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</P><P>Heartland is rumored to be behind the endangerment resolution, with former North Dakota state Rep. Bette Grande (R) — who now freelances for Heartland and participates in ALEC matters — thought to have drafted it and handed off the language to a state lawmaker and ALEC member.</P><P>Heartland did not respond to a request for comment.</P><P>Heartland and its allies have pushed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to take on the endangerment finding, which the EPA chief has been reluctant to pursue. Corporate America, meanwhile, largely supported staying in the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement and retaining the Clean Power Plan — an Obama administration rule to curb power plant emissions — but ultimately lost those battles to far-right groups, though some hope Trump will ultimately remain in the global <mark>climate</mark> pact.</P><H3>Bellwether moment?</H3><P>The endangerment finding vote may serve as a bellwether for where ALEC stands on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Is ALEC part and parcel of a conservative movement that has questioned <mark>climate change</mark> and the policy responses to it? Or does it operate among the wider atmosphere of reputation-conscious corporations and even some moderates who have opposed the Trump administration on <mark>climate change</mark>?</P><P>But that calculation also belies a more fundamental point about ALEC — while it has a reputation as a far-right group advancing industry interests, it's also a member-driven organization. If ALEC is shifting on <mark>climate</mark> and energy, it's largely because its members have, too.</P><P>&quot;If there were some grand conspiracy, I'd know about it, and there isn't,&quot; said Eli Lehrer, president of the free-market think tank R Street Institute, which supports a <mark>carbon</mark> tax. &quot;To the extent things have changed, it's because opinions have changed.&quot;</P><P>At its core, ALEC is an organization about free markets and limited government. Thus, its members also have railed against and helped craft bills to roll back President Obama's <mark>climate</mark> and environmental measures, many of which were federal regulations, and local incentives for clean energy. At the same time, though, the group has come under fire for taking cash from fossil fuel companies threatened by the advance of clean energy while often neglecting to mention subsidies and incentives that legacy energy sources enjoy.</P><P>Longtime ALEC watchdogs view the endangerment finding draft resolution as an attempt by its conservative members to reorient the organization to its roots after several rudderless years on energy and environment matters. Part of that is a response to the Trump administration, said Nick Surgey, director of Documented, an organization that tracks the influence of corporations on public policy.</P><P>&quot;This is a reflection of an organization that has shifted itself more into the mainstream of <mark>climate change</mark> in terms of rhetoric in the last three to four years,&quot; Surgey said. &quot;Now they've got almost everything they want from Scott Pruitt and the EPA, and they have to justify their existence to their funders. And it seems like they're allying themselves with the more radical of the funders.&quot;</P><P>The cohesion between ALEC and the Trump administration is evident to ALEC CEO Lisa Nelson. She sent a congratulatory email to its members on Jan. 30 to celebrate the new administration, saying, &quot;This administration does have the potential to be an ALEC administration. It is full of the people and ideas we've advanced since 1973.&quot;</P><P>But conservatives familiar with ALEC said they're concerned that the organization has gravitated to satisfying interests that aren't committed to the free-market principles upon which the group was created. They said that dynamic is most apparent in the energy and environment space.</P><P>&quot;When it comes to the policies of the organization, ALEC does have strong positions on issues that are consistent with the free market,&quot; Blair said. &quot;The issue is if they are planning to upend those principles to fundraise in the future.&quot;</P><P>They worry that ALEC is trying to plug a funding gap following the high-profile exits of Google, BP PLC, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, <mark>Royal Dutch Shell PLC</mark> and others, all of which blamed the organization's stance on <mark>climate change</mark> for their departure. Those companies left largely over pressure from shareholders who were spurred into action after activist groups harped on ALEC funding streams. The conservative billionaire industrialist Koch brothers are big donors; Exxon Mobil Corp., a member of the Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force, is also a major funder.</P><H3>Conservatives revolt</H3><P>ALEC's conservative members saw warning signs recently when feathers were ruffled over what they said in the past would have been a fairly easy decision.</P><P>The energy task force couldn't agree to move on a resolution that opposed property assessed clean energy, or PACE — a financing mechanism to fund clean energy or energy efficiency upgrades. Conservatives were worried about exposing taxpayers to losses, since municipal bonds underwrote many of the projects.</P><P>But many of ALEC's members also have PACE interests. One conservative source said those groups backing PACE angled to kill the resolution and criticized ALEC for trying to appease such funders. Rockwood Group CEO Scott Zajac, whose investment firm operates in the PACE world, was particularly vocal in opposing the resolution within ALEC, the source said.</P><P>Others, though, noted that's just how the energy space is these days — corporations are on board with clean energy. Rejecting mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science or trying to stymie growth of energy sources that compete with ALEC's old guard of coal, natural gas and oil companies doesn't fly anymore.</P><P>The PACE resolution foundered over much acrimony in ALEC's July meeting and was forbidden to ever return as a discussion point. That result has generated revolt from some of the more dogmatic conservatives.</P><P>&quot;I'm concerned that there has been an effort more recently to try and table what in the past would have been considered straightforward proposals based on free-market principles,&quot; said Tom Pyle, president of the conservative energy think tank Institute for Energy Research. &quot;That's what ALEC is supposed to be advancing.&quot;</P><P>That effort, though, is minor compared with the endangerment finding, which is a lightning rod in <mark>climate policy</mark> circles.</P><P>Publicly traded companies on the Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force are getting calls about the upcoming vote on the draft endangerment finding resolution, according to a source familiar with the situation. Companies on that task force include Exxon Mobil, Pfizer Inc. and United Parcel Service Inc.</P><P>&quot;We have not received calls on it to my knowledge, but either way it is not an issue we would support,&quot; UPS spokeswoman Kara Ross said in an email. &quot;As one of the leaders in <mark>sustainable</mark> and transparent logistics, our position on <mark>climate change</mark> is clear.&quot;</P><P>Aside from Exxon Mobil, Pfizer and UPS, the task force also includes lobby group heavyweights such as the Edison Electric Institute, American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and American Gas Association.</P><P>E&amp;E News contacted all those members. EEI, AGA, AFPM, Pfizer and Exxon Mobil did not respond to requests for comment. NRECA said it didn't want to challenge the endangerment finding because it supports &quot;inside the fence&quot; <mark>carbon</mark> emissions regulations on power plants to replace the Clean Power Plan, which Pruitt formally moved to repeal last month.</P><P>&quot;Challenging the endangerment finding would lead to a different result, which we think would be unwise,&quot; spokesman Dan Riedinger said in an email.</P></SECTION></SECTION></ARTICLE></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

But apparently Shell is not your typical oil and gas supermajor.</P><P class=""p1"">Unlike its American counterparts, the Anglo-Dutch company has long acknowledged the reality of global <mark>climate change</mark>. Furthermore, the company has made significant inroads in renewable energy, including <A href=""http://Shell to acquire 44% stake in US solar developer Silicon Ranch"">acquiring a 44% stake developer Silicon Ranch</A>, which is active in the U.S. South.</P><P class=""p1"">Last week Shell issued <A href=""https://www.shell.com/promos/meeting-the-goals-of-the-paris-agreement/_jcr_content.stream/1521983847468/5f624b9260ef2625f319558cbb652f8b23d331933439435d7a0fc7003f346f94/shell-scenarios-sky.pdf"">a new report</A>, the third in its series of future energy scenarios for the 21st century. Like the previous <EM>Mountains</EM> and <EM>Oceans</EM> reports <EM>Sky</EM> envisions a very strong role for renewable energy, particularly solar, starting well before 2050.</P><P class=""p1"">Unlike the other two, <EM>Sky</EM> models a strong role of policy and markets, looking at a combination of bottom-up and top-down change. But perhaps the biggest differentiator is that <EM>Sky</EM> envisions a world where temperature increases are limited to below 2 degrees Celsius.</P><P class=""p1"">This is all happening in a world where despite increasing efficiency primary energy demand continues to grow, with Shell anticipating a doubling of global primary energy demand from 2000 to 2050, and continuing to grow after that.</P><P> </P><P class=""p1""><STRONG>Solar and EVs on the rise</STRONG></P><P class=""p1"">In <EM>Sky</EM>, Shell models solar PV growth rates of 20% annually, with all new incremental electricity demand met by solar and wind by the 2030s. Under this measure, solar will reach 6500 GW of installed capacity by 2035, and from then to 2070, nearly 1000 GW will be added annually, with the global footprint of PV approaching the area of Spain.</P><P class=""p1"">This is accompanied by large increases in wind, biomass and other forms of renewable energy, but none on the scale of PV. In fact, the report sees solar meeting roughly the same portion of primary energy demand as oil in 2050, and becoming the dominant source of global primary energy – not just electricity, but all energy – by 2070.</P><P class=""p1"">This would be enabled by a massive increase in deployment of electric vehicles (EVs). Sky sees EVs representing more than half of global car sales as early as 2030, and this extending to all passenger vehicles by 2050, due to a combination of technologies including autonomous vehicles and 3D printing.</P><P> </P><P class=""p1""><STRONG>Contrast with EIA, IEA, and U.S. utilities</STRONG></P><P class=""p1"">Shell’s vision of a future powered largely by solar and other forms of renewable energy contrasts sharply with the scenarios put forth by the International Energy Agency (IEA), U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) and even more with the plans of U.S. utilities.</P><P class=""p1"">Both <A href=""https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2018/02/08/eia-downplays-solar-and-wind-in-future-projections-w-chart/"">EIA</A> and <A href=""http://IEA sells solar short"">IEA are assuming much less dynamic future growth from solar</A>, with IEA predicting that solar deployment will flatten in mid-century. In both cases, a number of academics have prominently criticized the assumptions made by the agencies. It is worth noting that the previous scenarios issued by both agencies missed the growth that renewable energy has seen, and both agencies show a bewildering inability to adapt their forecasts to reality.</P><P class=""p1"">But even the willful blindness of EIA and IEA to the growth of renewable energy is surpassed by that of many U.S. utilities. In its most recent forecast <A href=""https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2018/03/26/duke-low-balls-renewable-energy-in-its-<mark>climate</mark>-plans/"">Duke Energy predicted that renewable energy would supply only 23% of electricity in its service area by 2050</A>, and Michigan’s DTE Energy has released a renewable energy compliance report which shows that it expects to install only 13 MW-AC of solar through 2022.</P><P class=""p1"">But not all players in the power sector are showing the stubborn resistance to change that Duke and DTE display. NextEra Energy, which owns utility Florida Power and Light, recently signed a 2.75 GW PV module deal with JinkoSolar – the largest PV module supply contract known to <STRONG>pv magazine</STRONG> staff to date.</P><P class=""p1"">In the end, it remains to be seen if the forecast for solar in Sky plays out. There are several factors that could change everything, such as the potential for accelerated <mark>climate change</mark> due to natural feedback loops such as methane escaping from permafrost, which could lead to an increasing rate of natural disasters, failures of agriculture and rapid societal change.</P><P class=""p1"">In the end there is the possibility that even Shell is underestimating the rate of change, as the most optimistic scenarios have to date.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""entry-author-bio ""><H4>Christian Roselund</H4><DIV class=""author-text ""> Christian Roselund serves as Americas editor at pv magazine, and joined in 2014.

</A><SPAN style=""color:Green;""> &gt; </SPAN><SPAN>Political Activities</SPAN><DIV><H4>Named in Times research on FTSE 100 lobbying in Brussels and Westminster</H4><P>An investigation by The Times published on April 15 2017 disclosed that FTSE 100 groups had spent more than £24 million on lobbying in Brussels and about £335,000 funding all-party parliamentary groups in Westminster. The research examined political spending between January 2015 to March 2017.
Less than £10,000 of identified political and lobbying spending in the EU was disclosed to shareholders in the companies’ recent annual reports.
According to the report Shell spent 4,500,000 euros on EU lobbying.
The company donated £10,886 to the following all-party parliamentary groups: Transport &amp; Safety, Unconventional Oil &amp; Gas.
When contacted, the company replied: “Shell does not make donations to EU decision-makers or political parties. Shell is a leading FTSE100 company, and as part of our perfectly legitimate corporate activity we engage regularly with many stakeholders, including government ministers and officials, on a wide range of topics related to the energy industry and Shell’s operations.“</P><SMALL>Times Newspaper/Times Online www.timesonline.co.uk:Big business spends £25m on lobbying politicians (15 April 2017)</SMALL></DIV><DIV><H4>Senior executives knew it was party to vast bribery scheme in Nigeria</H4><P>A report published by Global Witness in April 2017 revealed evidence that senior Shell executives were aware that the company was party to a vast bribery scheme in Nigeria. The report gave details of internal Shell emails seen by Finance Uncovered and Global Witness which showed how the world’s fifth biggest company took part in a scheme which deprived Nigeria and its people of $1.1 billion in a murky deal for access to one of Africa’s most valuable oil blocks, known as OPL 245. 

In 2011 Shell and an Italian oil company paid $1.1 billion for the Nigerian oil block OPL 245. The money was paid to the Nigerian government but went out immediately to Malabu Oil and Gas a company owned by former Nigerian oil minister and convicted money launderer, Dan Etete.

Etete had awarded himself ownership of OPL 245 in 1998. The present chief executive of Shell Ben Van Beurden claimed that Shell was not guilty of any malpractice and was “morally OK”.

On this issue emails between senior Shell executives showed that they knew the money would be used for political bribes and in February 2016 Shell and the Italian oil company were raided by police. The allegations were that they were paying for stolen assets and that the payments were going to the man who stole the assets namely Dan Etete.

Before the deal for purchasing the oil block had been completed Shell had received a letter from the then Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan who had confirmed that the assets were owned by Malabu Oil and Gas.

However, in July 2010 Shell’s senior business adviser Guy Colegate had written to a colleague, Vice President of Shell Peter Robinson after he (Colegate) had met Etete a in Paris and said that in his opinion the letter from Goodluck Jonathan was clearly an attempt to deliver significant revenues to Goodluck Jonathan. He added that this whole deal was about personal gain and politics.

It was discovered that in 2010 Shell executives had sent each other emails which stated that Etete would spend much of the money gained from the deal on bribes. In August 2010 Robinson had sent Shell Head of Exploration Brinded a brief which stated  that the President (Goodluck Jonathan) was motivated to see 245 closed quickly and his opinion was that  this was driven by expectations that the proceeds that Malabu would receive would flow as political contributions.

Shell and the Italian company remained, at the time of writing, under investigation for this matter and in 2014 the Nigerian House of Representatives stated that the deal for OPL 245 was contrary to the laws of Nigeria.</P><SMALL>Global Witness:Shell Knew (April 2017)</SMALL></DIV><DIV><H4>Low Score in <mark>Climate</mark> Accountability Scorecard</H4><P>In October 2016 the Union of Concerned Scientists produced a report which gave an in-depth analysis of eight leading fossil fuel companies' <mark>climate</mark>-related communications, positions and actions - focusing on the period January 2015 to May 2016.

One of the companies analysed was Shell.

The analysis considered four main areas where the authors thought the companies must take immediate action to prevent the worst effects of global <mark>climate change</mark>. The report scored each company‘s response to each of these areas on a scale: Egregious (acted very irresponsibly) Poor, Fair, Good, Advanced (conformed with best practice).

Shell scored as follows on the four areas:
1.  Renouncing disinformation on <mark>Climate change</mark> and Policy - Fair
2.   Planning for a world free of <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> – ie  Laying out a Company wide pathway or plan to align its business model with the International <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement reached in Paris in 2015 - Fair
3.   Supporting fair and effective <mark>climate</mark> policies – Fair
4.   Fully disclosing <mark>climate</mark> risks – eg to shareholders – Poor

Overall the report considered that Shell scored Fair/Poor.

In addition the report stated that Shell had started, at least in its public communications, to consistently affirm both <mark>climate</mark> science and the consequent need for swift and deep reductions in emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.  Shell was a member of a number of Trade Associations (American Petroleum Institute, Western State Petroleum Institue) which had challenged the validity of <mark>climate change</mark> science, had attempted to spread disinformation regarding the impact of human activity on <mark>climate change</mark>, and had sought to reverse legislation aimed at reducing <mark>carbon</mark> emissons.

Shell UK was listed as being supportive of TTIP. It was listed as having an interest in the energy chapter and to facilitate access to US exports.

TTIP was said to became the biggest trade deal in the world if it was to succeed. The deal aims to remove ‘non-tariff barriers to trade’ which would benefit big business, but threatens to undermine safety regulations, workers’ rights, environmental protection rules and food standard regulations. 

Companies supporting TTIP therefore lost a mark under Ethical Consumer's political activities category.</P><SMALL>Corporate Europe Observatory:TTIP Stakeholder Grid (February 2015)</SMALL></DIV><DIV><H4>Lobbying againts <mark>climate change</mark> legislation</H4><P>Shell successfully lobbied to undermine European renewable energy targets ahead of a key agreement on emissions cuts reached in October last year the Guardian reported in April 2015. According to leaked documents a key part of the agreement – which was championed by the UK government – was proposed by a Shell lobbyist as early as October 2011.
Under the influence of lobbyists the UK and others had resisted binding targets for individual member states on energy efficiency and renewable energy and these did not make it into the final agreement. 
Shell had begun lobbying the Barroso, the former head of the EU, in 2011 to scrap the bloc’s existing formula for linking <mark>carbon</mark>-cutting goals with binding renewable energy laws. 
Shell argued that a market-led strategy of gas expansion would save Europe €500bn (£358bn) in its transition to a low <mark>carbon</mark> energy system, compared to an approach centred on renewables. 
Gas is good for Europe, and Europe is good at gas,” the firm’s upstream executive director, Malcolm Brinded wrote in a five-page letter to Barroso.
“Shell believes the EU should focus on reduction of greenhouse gases as the unique <mark>climate</mark> objective after 2020, and allow the market to identify the most cost efficient way to deliver this target, thus preserving competitiveness of industry, protecting employment and consumer buying power, to drive economic growth,” he wrote,  adding in a hand-written note at the end, “This is a great opportunity for the EU to seize!”
The bloc eventually agreed that by 2030, every country would cut its emissions by 40%, measured against 1990 levels, and that although the EU as a whole would commit to a 27% share for renewables in the energy mix, that target was not binding on individual member states.
But the clean energy industry says that this is not enough to give investors the long-term certainty that they need.
The Guardian also reports that:
The firm’s ‘single target’ idea gathered traction, particularly among supporters of nuclear power and shale gas, and was agreed as an official position  in discussions between the UK Treasury and the Department of Energy and <mark>Climate Change</mark> in mid-2013.
Britain spearheaded the idea, with support from other countries in inter-state Green Growth Group meetings that year, before successfully getting a variant of the idea into the final agreement last October.
According the Guardian Shell is the sixth biggest lobbyist in Brussels, spending between €4.25-4.5m a year lobbying the EU institutions, according to the bloc’s transparency register.</P><SMALL>Guardian, The:Shell lobbied to undermine EU renewables targets, documents reveal (28 April 2015)</SMALL></DIV><DIV><H4>Top three spender on EU lobbying</H4><P>A report by Transparency International (TI) from 24 June 2015 stated that the overwhelming majority of lobby meetings held by European Commissioners and their closest advisers were with representatives of corporate interests.

Analysis of the 4,318 lobby meetings declared by the top tier of European Commission officials between December 2014 and June 2015 showed that more than 75% were with corporate lobbyists. This compared to 18% with NGOs, 4% with think tanks and 2% with local authorities.

Shell was listed as one of the top three companies in terms of lobby budgets according to its declarations made to the EU Transparency Register, with a budget of around 4.5-5 million euros.

TI added, however, that this information &quot;is just part of the picture&quot;, as lobbying information is voluntarily filed, and according to TI, &quot;much of the information... is inaccurate, incomplete or outright meaningless&quot;. The European Commission's new transparency provisions covered only the highest ranking top 1% of EU officials and 20% of the registered lobby organisations.</P><SMALL>Transparency International:Lobby meetings with EU policy-makers dominated by corporate interests (24 June 2015)</SMALL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

	Big Oil majors BP plc, Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil Corp. and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell plc</mark> are being sued by San Francisco and Oakland to force the operators to pay for the cost of protecting Northern California from rising sea levels and the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>
	The separate lawsuits, which do not seek specific financial compensation, were filed Tuesday in state court in San Francisco and Alameda counties. San Francisco’s lawsuit projected that long-term improvements to the city’s seawall would cost an estimated $5 billion.</P><P>“These fossil fuel companies profited handsomely for decades while knowing they were putting the fate of our cities at risk,” said San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera. “Instead of owning up to it, they copied a page from the Big Tobacco playbook. They launched a multi-million dollar disinformation campaign to deny and discredit what was clear even to their own scientists: global warming is real, and their product is a huge part of the problem.”</P><P>
	Oakland City Attorney Barbara J. Parker, whose city sits across from San Francisco on the East Bay, said the laws were “clear that the defendants are responsible for the consequences of their reckless and disastrous actions. The harm to our cities has commenced and will only get worse.”</P><P>
	The attorneys cited documents they claim show that the producers knew about the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> caused by fossil fuel emissions but chose to sow doubts publicly about it.</P><P>
	Chevron, headquartered in Northern California in San Ramon, said the litigation would not help address <mark>climate change</mark>.
	A spokesman for Chevron, Melissa Ritchie, said the lawsuits would not help address <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue that requires global engagement and action,&quot; Chevron spokeswoman Melissa Ritchie said. &quot;Should this litigation proceed, it will only serve special interests at the expense of broader policy, regulatory, and economic priorities.&quot;</P><P>
	Chevron welcomes opportunities to fight <mark>climate change</mark>, but the lawsuits are not constructive, it said.</P><P>“Chevron welcomes serious attempts to address the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>, but these suits do not do that,” the company stated. &quot;Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue that requires global engagement and action. Should this litigation proceed, it will only serve special interests at the expense of broader policy, regulatory and economic priorities.”</P><P>
	ExxonMobil, which is in the midst of a <A href=""http://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/111724-exxonmobil-loses-bid-in-fraud-lawsuit-to-keep-auditor-records-private"">federal lawsuit and related litigation</A> initially spearheaded by New York’s attorney general about how its operations may impact <mark>climate change</mark>, called into question the validity of the California lawsuits.</P><P>“The claims in these lawsuits are without merit,” said an ExxonMobil spokesman. “We will vigorously defend ourselves against them.”</P><P>
	The plaintiffs in these lawsuits “may have overplayed their hand by moving their fight against <mark>climate change</mark> from the court of public opinion to a court of law,” said attorney Nicholas S. Preservati of Spilman Thomas &amp; Battle in Charleston, WV. “The plaintiffs must now actually substantiate their claims that manmade <mark>carbon</mark> emissions are the root cause of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“Contrary to the allegations in the lawsuit, sea levels are lower now than they were in September 2015 according to NASA,” he said. “In addition, the plaintiffs will have a difficult time proving damages from rising sea levels, since NASA records show less than a 3.5-inch increase in sea levels over the past 25 years.”</P><P>
	In addition, the plaintiffs may have to prove “the Arctic ice melt is the result of manmade <mark>carbon</mark> emissions instead of the 1,100 mile string of volcanoes (Gakkel Ridge) that are releasing heat and methane beneath the Arctic Ocean,” Preservati said. “While there are many hurdles facing the plaintiffs, this lawsuit may ultimately fall under its own weight as the plaintiffs should be required to join all emitters of <mark>carbon</mark> as indispensable parties.”</P><P>
	A related case is underway against ExxonMobil. In a <A href=""http://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/107933-exxonmobil-failed-to-prepare-massachusetts-terminal-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change-impact-lawsuit-claims"">first of its kind lawsuit</A> filed against the company last year, Judge Mark L. Wolf of the U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, earlier this month dismissed in part claims by the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) concerning <mark>climate change</mark> impacts.</P><P>
	CLF’s lawsuit asserts several things, including that ExxonMobil’s Everett oil transfer and storage facility in Boston Harbor has failed to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit and the U.S. Clean Water Act. The lawsuit also claims the marine terminal has not been sufficiently upgraded to handle <mark>climate change</mark> impacts. The lawsuit is <EM>Conservation Law Foundation v. ExxonMobil</EM>, No. CV-16:11950.</P><P>
	Wolf allowed the lawsuit to continue, but CLF was ordered to remove the <mark>climate change</mark> references. The judge wrote that he wanted to avoid the “Scopes Monkey Trial of the 21st Century,” referring to the famous 1925 trial about whether evolution should be taught in Tennessee schools. The trial devolved into a debate about human origin.</P><P>
	References have to stripped out regarding harm caused by <mark>climate change</mark> that would occur in 2050 or later. Material to the case is whether there is a foreseeable risk of substantial change in sea level, Wolf said. However, it is not important whether the cause of the sea level change is because of “warming of the atmosphere or a Noah’s Ark phenomenon.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""likes social-networking""><A href=""https://twitter.com/share"" class=""twitter-share-button"" data-lang=""en"" data-size=""medium"">Tweet</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""box3 article author-biography""><DIV class=""article-author-bio""><DIV class=""records""><DIV class=""record""><DIV class=""author_bio noimage""><DIV style=""width:575px;height:auto;margin:0 auto;""><DIV style=""width:100%;height:auto;padding:0 0 0 0;margin:0 auto;""><P style=""font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:16px;""><B>Managing Editor</B> | <B>Houston, TX</B><SPAN style=""font-family:Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-size:11pt;"">Carolyn Davis joined the editorial staff of Intelligence Press Inc. in Houston in May, 2000.

These accusations indicated at a fraud and the company was asked to present more documents.Schneiderman’s filing followed a day after President Trump announced plans to pull out of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord. Per the accord, about 200 countries vowed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to slow global warming. The President’s decision was condemned by several world leaders and many U.S. executives.<STRONG>How Investors Were Mislead</STRONG>Eric Schneiderman is believed to hold evidence against ExxonMobil that can prove that the company had been presenting false and misleading statements. This could have led investors to think that ExxonMobil had accurately evaluated the risks. However, the company is likely to have overlooked a formula to estimate the impact of future environmental regulation on new deals.In his filings, Schneiderman focused on the method used by ExxonMobil to present investors with estimates of the regulatory cost of greenhouse gas emissions on new projects. The company often presented a number it called a “proxy cost” for greenhouse gases. Through this, the company tried to account for prospective changes to government policy that will make the production and consumption of fossil fuels more costly.Per Schneiderman, this whole accounting may be a fraud as the company might not have used it when calculating profits and losses on investments. This can again be verified by examining ExxonMobil’s documents of oil sands project, which indicates profit over the course of the project’s original timeline. The case would have been separate, if ExxonMobil applied the proxy cost it promised to shareholders. Per the attorney general, at least one significant oil sand project might have projected a financial loss.Along with Schneiderman’s reports, ExxonMobil’s <mark>climate</mark>-related statements to investors are also being examined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on how it values its oil and gas reserves amid low prices as well as potential restrain on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.However, the company has denied such allegations and stated that its external statements have correctly presented the use of a proxy cost of <mark>carbon</mark>. Also, the documents forwarded to the attorney general make this fact apparent. The company will present more documents to support court filings.<STRONG>Transparency Issue</STRONG>Recently, ExxonMobil has been actively involved in implementing <mark>climate change</mark> policies, thanks to tremendous pressure from investors and environmentalists. The primary objectives include the restriction of greenhouse gas emissions, reduction in global warming, appointment of a <mark>climate</mark> expert on the board, reports on fracking activities and <mark>climate change</mark> impact assessments.As a result, the company has increased <mark>climate</mark>-related disclosures. These disclosures include affirmation of the company’s pledge to the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement, inclusion of an environmental expert to its board and the reduction of emission from its operations. However, ExxonMobil is avoiding shareholders’ request for additional information regarding the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> in its operations.However, the company has been struggling with Schneiderman’s requests for information about its <mark>climate change</mark> policies in state and federal court. ExxonMobil argues that it is not liable to produce records because the New York-based prosecutor’s probe is politically provoked and is an insult.The opposition by ExxonMobil has led to a strange situation. Usually, State and federal prosecutors only disclose their findings once they have concluded the process and are ready to file charges.ExxonMobil sued Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is also questioning the company in federal court. Moreover, the company’s effort to challenge Schneiderman’s subpoenas has led the prosecutor to forward the proofs to fight his case on why ExxonMobil should be forced to provide more documents.As part of the inquiry, ExxonMobil has already submitted 2 million documents. These documents have revealed that Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of ExxonMobil, used a separate email address under a different name — Wayne Tracker — to talk about <mark>climate change</mark>-related issues while at the company.Schneiderman is searching more documents, that haven’t been forwarded by ExxonMobil. He is trying to interrogate employees who might know about the company’s internal <mark>climate change</mark> plans. <STRONG>How ExxonMobil Plans to Fight <mark>Climate Change</mark></STRONG>ExxonMobil has launched a plan to slash methane emissions from its onshore assets in the United States. The company plans to replace old equipments with updated technology. It has already invested about $8 billion on energy efficiency and low-emission technologies such as <mark>carbon</mark> capture and next-generation biofuels.ExxonMobil will focus on employee training to reduce emissions. The company plans to study the use of satellites, drones and other relevant equipment in controlling future leakages. The company's ally, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, may help with drones for detecting methane.<STRONG>Other Lawsuits Filed on <mark>Climate Change</mark> Issues</STRONG>In September 2017, two major Californian cities — San Francisco and Oakland — filed lawsuits against five oil and energy super majors. The cities had taken legal action against Chevron Corp.

This includes the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on energy prices and the environment as well as the company’s ability to develop reserves.Notably, many such lawsuits have been filed in the past which did not bear results. In 2009, Kivalina, AK, filed charges against many oil companies which got dismissed in the court and repealed by the Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency.In 2011, the Supreme Court of U.S. overruled the public nuisance claims of eight states and the New York City against electric utility companies. In July 2017, similar litigation cases were filed by two coastal counties of California — Marin and San Mateo — against oil majors like Chevron, BP, Shell and ExxonMobil among others for rising sea levels. The charges claimed that the companies were responsible for emitting about 20% of greenhouse gases between 1965 and 2015.The verdict is pending and there are chances that this case might fail given the complex nature of legal requirements.<STRONG>Bottom Line</STRONG>Of late, ExxonMobil’s argument was dismissed by the U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan as “implausible”. Also, Schneiderman and Healey were said to be pursuing politically motivated as well as fraud investigations with the intention of breaching its constitutional rights. Even the Massachusetts Supreme Court rejected ExxonMobil’s appeal to block the state’s attorney general from obtaining records to examine whether the company had hidden its knowledge of the role of fossil fuels in <mark>climate change</mark> for decades.Caproni discharged the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning the Irving, Texas-based company cannot bring it again.This is a major turning point, which is likely to result in ExxonMobil being prosecuted for misleading investors. Moreover, the documents produced by the company and evidences shown by Schneiderman are against the company.<STRONG>Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending</STRONG>A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

And we intend to continue to provide strong returns for shareholders well into the future.”</P><P style=""font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"">The report contains Shell’s principal response to the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on <mark>Climate</mark>-related Financial Disclosures and demonstrates the company’s near- and mid-term financial and portfolio resilience, even against its recently-published and most rapid energy transition scenario, known as <EM style=""font-weight: inherit;"">Sky.</EM>  It also explains how Shell’s capacity to adapt to the transition should allow it to thrive in the longer term by supplying the types of energy customers will need over the coming decades.  For Shell, this means that the company will still sell the oil and gas that society needs, while preparing its portfolio to move into lower-<mark>carbon</mark> energy, when this makes commercial sense.</P><P style=""font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"">Shell’s strategy, global portfolio and strong financial framework provide the ability to thrive through potential changes in the energy system to 2030. Every year the company assesses its portfolio under different scenarios, including prolonged low oil prices. In addition, Shell ranks the break-even prices of its assets in the Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses to assess their resilience against low oil and gas prices. These assessments indicate a low risk of stranded assets in the current portfolio. As of 31 December 2017, Shell estimates that around 80% of its current proved oil and gas reserves will be produced by 2030, and only 20% after that time.</P><P style=""font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"">In the medium term, Shell will grow its business in areas it expects to be important in the energy transition, while reducing costs and improving its <mark>CO2</mark>-intensity performance. The company is expanding in the power market as it expects the energy system to increasingly electrify, and it is adjusting its businesses to meet changing demand in different countries. This includes investments in areas such as wind generation in the Netherlands, supplying power to retail customers in the UK and offering hydrogen refueling and electric-car charging.</P><P>Longer term there is great uncertainty in how the energy transition will unfold, but Shell believes its strategic flexibility will allow it to adapt in step with society. Shell has previously announced its ambition to reduce the Net <mark>Carbon</mark> Footprint of the energy products the company sells by around half by the middle of the century in alignment with society as it moves towards implementing the Paris goals.  Critically, this plan covers the full energy life cycle of the company’s products, making it unique in the energy industry. It includes not only emissions from the production of energy products, but also those from the consumption of Shell’s products by its customers, where around 85% of the emissions associated with the company’s energy products occur. Progress will be reviewed every five years to ensure it is in-step with society’s progress towards the Paris goal of limiting global warming.</P></SECTION></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It seeks not only damages for past harms the city has suffered, but wants the oil companies to pay the cost of all the adaptation programs that it has had to start or plan.</P><P>In making the announcement, city officials announced they're putting their money where their lawsuit is. Over the next five years, New York City will divest its pension funds, which currently hold just under $200 billion dollars, from fossil fuel companies.</P><H2>Creating a nuisance</H2><P>New York City isn't the first to file suit against the oil companies. A number of California cities and counties, including San Francisco and Oakland, did so last year. Those suits targeted the same five companies named in the one announced today: Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, BP, and Royal Dutch Shell. These are the five largest companies, and the suit estimates that they are collectively responsible for over 10 percent of the total greenhouse gases that have accumulated in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution.</P><P>But they clearly weren't the only companies responsible for <mark>climate change</mark>. And, to a large extent, they simply supplied the fuels that were then combusted by other parties. So why should these five companies be held liable? New York's suit tackles this issue in a number of ways. Echoing some tobacco-related litigation, the city states that &quot;This lawsuit is based upon the fundamental principle that a corporation that makes a product causing severe harm when used exactly as intended should shoulder the costs of abating that harm.&quot;</P><P>Beyond that, the suit makes heavy use of a variety of documents that have come to light over the last several years. Collectively, these show that the companies were well aware of the risks of harm from <mark>climate change</mark> and continued to cast doubt on the science publicly despite that.</P><P>&quot;Disregarding the findings of their own internal scientists and scientific consultants, Defendants re-committed themselves to fossil fuel exploration, production, marketing, and sales over the ensuing decades,&quot; the suit claims. &quot;The significant majority of emissions resulting from fossil fuels produced and marketed by Defendants occurred after Defendants became aware of the consequences of <mark>climate change</mark>.&quot;</P><P>To back this up, the suit cites the now-extensive documentation that several companies, notably Exxon, were aware of the growing scientific consensus about the role of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the <mark>climate</mark> and even sponsored their own research that came to the same conclusions. The suit notes that all five defendants were members of the American Petroleum Institute, and thus received copies of an expert report that warned of &quot;GLOBALLY CATASTROPHIC EFFECTS&quot; this century and that &quot;'THERE IS NO LEEWAY' in the time for acting.&quot; The science was so widely accepted within the companies, the suit argues, that they started designing and modifying their infrastructure to protect against the consequences of <mark>climate change</mark>, such as sea-level rise.</P><P>Despite their internal actions, the suit notes that the companies were simultaneously engaged in a PR campaign that downplayed our confidence in <mark>climate</mark> science. They contributed funding to a group called the Global <mark>Climate</mark> Coalition, which was telling the press that all the <mark>carbon</mark> emissions would be great for plant life even as internal documents admitted that it could &quot;not offer convincing arguments against the conventional model of greenhouse gas emission-induced <mark>climate change</mark>.&quot;</P><P>As late as the year 2000, Exxon was taking out ads entitled &quot;Unsettled Science&quot; while funding scientists who cast doubt on mainstream science. Rex Tillerson, then-CEO and current secretary of state, was still raising doubts about scientists in 2015, asking, &quot;What if, [after] everything we do, it turns out our models were really lousy, and we achieved all of our objectives, and it turned out the planet behaved differently because the models just weren't good enough to predict it?&quot;</P><H2>Defining harms</H2><P>So the legal theory seems to be that the companies were convinced of the harms internally but misled the public about them in order to continue with business as usual. That, New York argues, makes for direct harm against city property: &quot;Global warming is already causing the City to suffer increased hot days, flooding of low-lying areas, increased shoreline erosion, and higher threats of catastrophic storm surge flooding even more severe than the flooding from Hurricane Sandy.&quot;</P><P>Included in these arguments are some interesting details. For example, the city already supports programs to help its residents during heat waves, which kill more New Yorkers than all other natural disasters combined—they're expected to get worse due to <mark>climate change</mark>. Extreme precipitation events are up 70 percent in the Northeast over the last 50 years, and these force the city to protect infrastructure like the subway from streets that simply can't drain fast enough. And sea levels that we're expected to reach later this century would mean a 100-year flood would inundate 97 percent of NYC's power generation capacity and 20 percent of its hospital beds. Parks, housing, and other infrastructure are also at risk.</P><P>The city has already paid for some of these issues after Hurricane Sandy and other less notable floods, and it's currently spending money to harden its infrastructure against similar events. There are additional programs that the city's staff also thinks are good ideas, but the money simply isn't available to pursue them.</P><P>All of those issues combine to create the three issues highlighted by the suit. It alleges the oil companies have created a public nuisance for the city: &quot;Defendants' conduct constitutes a substantial and unreasonable interference with and obstruction of public rights and property, including the public rights to health, safety, and welfare of a considerable number of people who reside in and visit New York City.&quot; The private nuisance allegation comes about because the city owns some of the properties that have and will be damaged or that will need to be hardened to adapt to future <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>Finally, the allegation of trespass is based on the idea that the companies are altering city properties without permission. Their conduct, the suit alleges, &quot;was substantially certain to result in the invasion of property owned by the City, without permission or right of entry, by way of increased heat, sea level rise, storm surge flooding, and flooding from increased intensity and frequency of precipitation.&quot;</P><H2>One of many?</H2><P>What's the city want? It wants the costs it has already spent to protect its infrastructure, property, and residents. It also wants the oil companies to fund all the programs that will be necessary to protect the city against the further changes that <mark>climate change</mark> will bring. It wants to see its legal costs covered by the oil companies. And, if the companies don't pay up, the city would like to see the court order them to stop any activities that contribute to the alleged harms.</P><P>In many ways, the suit is similar to <A href=""https://www.sfcityattorney.org/2017/09/19/san-francisco-oakland-sue-top-five-oil-gas-companies-costs-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">some of those brought in California</A>, which also seek the current costs of building infrastructure that will protect against the near-inevitable future course of <mark>climate change</mark>. So far, none of the efforts has been tested in court. But simply by being filed, they pose a risk to the oil companies. The suits themselves are based largely on internal documents that have been leaked over the years. The process of discovery could potentially open up a much larger collection of internal communications, some of which might convince other communities that it's possible to build a case.</P><P>All of the communities that have acted so far are coastal and so have obvious issues due to <mark>climate</mark>-driven sea-level rise. But it's clear that <mark>climate</mark>-related issues are creating costs across the country, as communities deal with effects like melting permafrost, an extended wildfire season, and more. If any of the initial suits gain legal traction, then the oil companies could find themselves facing an endless sea of lawsuits.</P><P>New York City's decision to divest, by contrast, is a much smaller threat. Fossil fuels divestment will have to become much more widespread before oil company stocks are at risk of sudden price fluctuations.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class=""inline-video"" title=""The Greatest Leap, Episode 3: Triumph"" data-video-overlay-template-id=""tmpl-5a340160148bb05431000005""><H3>Latest Ars Video <SPAN>&gt;</SPAN></H3><DIV class=""video-description""><H2>The Greatest Leap, Episode 3: Triumph</H2><SPAN>In honor of the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Apollo Program, Ars Technica brings you an in depth look at the Apollo missions through the eyes of the participants.</SPAN></DIV><TEMPLATE type=""text/template"" id=""tmpl-5a340160148bb05431000005""><FIGURE class=""video""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption""><DIV class=""caption-text"">The Greatest Leap, Episode 3: Triumph</DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H3>The Greatest Leap, Episode 3: Triumph</H3><P class=""excerpt"">In honor of the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Apollo Program, Ars Technica brings you an in depth look at the Apollo missions through the eyes of the participants.</P></TEMPLATE></SECTION></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""column-wrapper""><DIV class=""left-column""><SECTION class=""article-author""><DIV class=""author-bio""><SECTION class=""author-bio-top""><A href=""/author/john-timmer"" class=""author-name"">John Timmer</A>

Attorneys seek an order requiring defendants to abate the global warming-induced sea level rise by funding an abatement program to build sea walls and other infrastructure. Attorneys for the cities say this abatement fund will be in the billions.
The two complaints, filed Sept. 19, 2017, in California Superior Court in San Francisco and Alameda counties name as defendant five fossil fuel corporations that have produced more fossil fuels than any other investor-owned companies in the world and seeks to hold them accountable for past, ongoing and future-planned development of fossil fuels, which is directly impacting the cities’ risk of rising sea levels, the suit says. “This case is, fundamentally, about shifting the costs of abating sea level rise harm – one of global warming’s gravest harms – back onto the companies,” the suit reads.
The suits state that the defendants knowingly continue their environmentally destructive behavior, seeking to shroud it with a sophisticated campaign to sway public opinion on fossil fuel use and that defendants have misleadingly downplayed the risks of global warming with a campaign of denial that was intended to promote their fossil fuels products. &quot;This egregious state of affairs is no accident. Rather, it is an unlawful public nuisance of the first order.”
The suits detail a history of flagrant disregard from Big Oil as the impacts of fossil fuel usage on the environment became more and more clear and that the management of these corporations were warned by their own scientists and trade association scientists in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The suits state that the defendants knew that “massive fossil fuel usage would cause dangerous global warming.”
These actions carry on into the present, as the risk of rising sea levels intensifies, especially for coastal cities. “Defendants took these stark warnings and proceeded to double-down on fossil fuels,” the complaint states. “Even at this time, with the global warming danger level at a critical phase, defendants continue to engage in massive fossil fuel production and execute long-term business plans to continue and even expand their fossil fuel production for decades into the future.”</P></SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

	Can development organizations be more agile and adaptable in a context of constant change?
</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
Constrained by an ageing model of “North-South” assistance and linear thinking, development organizations are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the complexities and interconnectedness of global challenges, from <mark>climate change</mark> to communicable diseases. However, the convergence of three trends promises a structural change in the way development organizations operate: new ways of framing development problems (complexity theory), new information technologies and new types of coalitions. How can development organizations reform themselves to become more effective at improving the world?<P><STRONG>Development organizations exist to help reduce poverty and inequality, and improve human well-being. These problems are becoming increasingly complex as the world grows more connected and volatile.</STRONG> Cross-border flows of goods, services, people and ideas are expanding. Shocks and crises, whether social, political, economic or environmental, are increasingly frequent. As issues become more interconnected and uncertain, the outcomes of development interventions are harder to predict or explain and it is less possible for one actor alone to get things done.</P><P><STRONG>Despite these changes, the operating model of development organizations is constrained by its legacy.</STRONG> This includes centralized assistance from “developed” country governments to “developing” country governments and practices that largely rely on linear models to understand risk and to plan, execute and evaluate action. </P><P>Can development organizations be more agile and adaptable in today’s context of constant change? The combination of three trends that can help frame, understand and respond to complex problems differently offers an opportunity. </P><P><STRONG>First, complexity theory is shifting attention from linear cause and effect relationships to dynamic processes of change.</STRONG> Complexity theory has been used in physics and ecology to study how systems adapt to their environment and cope with uncertainty. Many development scholars argue that complexity theory can strengthen development organizations’ ability to understand dynamic and interconnected development problems and respond more appropriately.</P><P>In <I>Aid on the Edge of Chaos</I>, Ben Ramalingam shows how this approach can be applied to household food security. Traditionally, most of the work concentrated on predicting the occurrence of a food crisis in order to best respond. Analysing and modelling food systems and the multiple connections between socio-economic and ecological factors that contribute to their stability helped create an understanding of households’ capacity to respond to the negative effects of unpredictable climatic shocks. Analysing these variables, which change over time, can support policies to strengthen household resilience and adapt aid interventions more strategically in crisis situations.</P><P><STRONG>Second, new technologies are opening the door to understanding and anticipating complex development problems through the so-called “data revolution”.</STRONG> New types of data and analytical tools have the potential to provide real-time information on complex situations or sudden change and enable quick feedback loops to inform planning and adjust operations. They can also be used to collect citizens’ voices and feedback and integrate them in programme design. </P><P>For instance, mTrac, a Ugandan platform supported by UNICEF, the World Health Organization and the UK Department for International Development (DFID), surveys local health workers via mobile phone text messaging and then alerts national public health officials about malaria outbreaks and medicine stock situations to anticipate and resolve shortages. The share of health facilities that have run out of malaria treatments has fallen from 80% to 15% since it was introduced. The platform also includes an anonymous text message hotline that citizens can use to report any service delivery problems they face. </P><P><STRONG>Third, new kinds of coalitions and movements are emerging as the multiplication of development actors provides opportunities to redefine partnerships.</STRONG> A growing number of actors operating in the development space, from businesses and municipal governments to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and communities, are starting to figure out how to work together on a voluntary basis to solve specific issues. These coalitions of diverse actors bring information, expertise and funding together in ways that cut across domains, geographies and interests. This can lead to new solutions to old problems, e.g. by presenting development challenges as investment opportunities. </P><P>Examples of such projects already delivering results include the <I>Scaling Up Nutrition </I>(SUN) initiative. SUN brings NGOs, businesses and the UN together to accelerate global efforts on under-nutrition. Organized in a global network, each group of actors supports national efforts to improve nutrition by providing funds and expertise. For actors engaged in the SUN initiative, improving nutrition for women and children is no longer only a moral objective, it is also a way to strengthen the workforce and thus contribute to the growth of markets and nations alike. </P><P>None of these trends are completely new in themselves. But their confluence could transform the operating model of development organizations in ways that include more effective delivery of essential services for the poor; changing engagement with the private sector, from donation providers to partners for supply, investment and solution design; changing engagement with citizens, from intervention recipients to agents of change; enhancing knowledge and data systems co-created by a diversity of actors to inform decision-making; and a growing capacity to tackle multi-dimensional problems and operate effectively in uncertain contexts. </P><P>The opportunities presented by these changes come with challenges, notably, that of changing the culture of development organizations to encourage experimentation and value adaptive strategies. The use of big data raises issues of privacy that could, if mishandled, exacerbate discrimination and inequalities. The growing number of actors, coalitions and movements also raises leadership and coordination challenges, in particular for the intergovernmental decision-making structures created for these purposes.</P><P>However, development organizations exist to solve challenges. Leadership from within to overcome existing political and technical tensions could help mobilize these trends and make development more effective.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
