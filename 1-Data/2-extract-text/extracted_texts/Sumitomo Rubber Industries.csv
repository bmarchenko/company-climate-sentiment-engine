actions.” This is actually very true because bigger effects on the earth’s
atmosphere causing global warming are being done by oil companies and
government investing in them versus the small actions of an everyday person
using his/her car or hair dryer, laptop, etc. Due to the fact that northern
ecosystems are warming the fastest, scientists can predict that if we continue
with these types of actions such as the bigger ones done by oil companies the
earth’s ecosystem will be at its highest global warmth possible by 2021. This
is very important because not only will this affect the animals in these
ecosystems but ultimately us humans as well and ultimately cause an increase in
<mark>Co2</mark> on the atmosphere cause by fossil fuel burning and forest fires, etc.. Little
actions such as saving light and changing to hybrid cars or using the washers
at night versus the day won’t do much change and it hasn’t as we’ve seen.
Investing in methods to stop the oil companies’ actions will do a bigger faster
change, which is what we need, because the industries and the governments
decisions on them are what’s causing the major global warming on earth.

<mark>climate change</mark>; humans are just doing activities.” I agree with the author,
because only a part of humans can decide how much the green house gases will be
emitted, especially the owners of the factories like car production plants.
When people make productions like manufacturing the cars and the furniture,
people will inevitably burn the fossil fuel. In my Bio sic9K class, I learned
that fossil fuel burning will cause 5.3*10^15 grams <mark>carbon</mark> annually. Also,
deforestation and forest fires will lead to 0.6-2.6*10^15 grams <mark>carbon</mark>
annually. The government should create better policy to alleviate the green
house gases emission, since in the long term, as the temperature increases, the
solar ice caps will thaw. The polar bear will lose their habitat. Furthermore,
the drought in the California may be more severe. “#UCIGCB2015”</P></DIV></DIV></LI><LI class=""comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1"" id=""dsq-comment-51241""><DIV id=""dsq-comment-header-51241"" class=""dsq-comment-header""><CITE id=""dsq-cite-51241""><SPAN id=""dsq-author-user-51241"">Ben</SPAN></CITE></DIV><DIV id=""dsq-comment-body-51241"" class=""dsq-comment-body""><DIV id=""dsq-comment-message-51241"" class=""dsq-comment-message""><P>An interesting piece, but on balance I don’t agree with it.  Corporations respond to market pressures; they do whatever they can do within the law to turn a profit.  Our whole society is set up on that basis.  If they do things that we don’t want them to be doing, that is a failure of regulation, not of the corporations themselves.  I don’t mean that what the corporations are doing is not immoral and should not be condemned; I just mean that as long as doing those things turns a healthy profit, the corporations will continue doing those things no matter how society scolds them (unless and until the scolding actually affects their bottom line).  You say that all of the truly guilty individuals could fit on a Greyhound bus; the rather uncomfortable implication seems to be that if only the world was rid of those 90 or so humans, the rest of us could tra-la-la into a <mark>carbon</mark>-free future.  That completely misses the problem.  It all comes down to incentives.  If we want corporations to change their behavior, we need to put a different incentive structure in place, and that means two things: regulations and taxes.  Those things come out of the political process, which means it is, in fact, our responsibility as citizens to make them happen.</P><P>And then there is the rather breezy dismissal of all individual choices as being basically irrelevant in the face of corporate action; but that is simply not true.  Corporations don’t force people to eat meat, which accounts for a huge portion of agricultural <mark>CO2</mark>-equivalent emissions.  Corporations don’t force people to drive cars instead of bicycling, walking, or taking public transit, which amounts for a huge portion of transportation sector emissions.  Corporations don’t force people to buy McMansions instead of living in high-density housing, which accounts for a huge amount of housing-related emissions.  And on it goes.  Yes, your point is valid that secret lobbying by corporations undermines regulations and public awareness; but nevertheless, people do bear responsibility for their own choices, and claiming that people make bad choices because corporations have brainwashed them is patronizing and largely untrue.  Anyone who wants to know the facts about <mark>climate change</mark> can find them out in ten minutes on the internet.

You’re right that I could have given more credit to consumer decisions; that’s particularly true when it comes to fuel efficient vehicles and the electric car market, too. That said, I’m definitely not calling for us to rid ourselves of anyone, so I’m sorry if my piece implied that to you. Instead, I’m calling for companies to stop actively lobbying against <mark>climate</mark> legislation. If we have legislation, that changes the ground rules for everyone and right now the ground rules are tilted toward more fossil fuel production, with limited support for alternatives. And while I agree that corporations don’t force anyone to do anything, I think people generally underestimate the power that policies and corporations do have to circumscribe the range of choices we have as consumers. I’d add that car and fossil-fuel companies have also contributed to development decisions — including at the local level — that have emphasized car travel over public transport, for instance. Again, we’re not making individual choices in a vacuum.</P></DIV></DIV></LI><LI class=""comment even thread-even depth-1"" id=""dsq-comment-51240""><DIV id=""dsq-comment-header-51240"" class=""dsq-comment-header""><CITE id=""dsq-cite-51240""><SPAN id=""dsq-author-user-51240"">Yiling</SPAN></CITE></DIV><DIV id=""dsq-comment-body-51240"" class=""dsq-comment-body""><DIV id=""dsq-comment-message-51240"" class=""dsq-comment-message""><P>Some of our daily human activities, such as driving or using machines, are hard to change in our real life. “In an ideal world, these human activities would continue. They simply wouldn’t produce the heat-trapping gases that are rapidly altering the
<mark>climate</mark> on which we depend.” Although we are now conscious about the global warming and eager to revise the page of our <mark>climate</mark>, we should all know the truth that even if we all stop using green house energy by today the earth is still going to warm up. Scientists recommend keep global warming below 2ºC of pre-industrial levels. What does the 2ºC means to us? It means that a lot of species that are near
extinction, like polar bears and seals would still live on this earth. And more
importantly, we would still have glaciers and ice to keep our planet regulating
normally- they have high albedo, which can reflect sunlight back to space. We
would still be able to have our northern ecosystem.  On the other hand, we would lose all of these features if our temperature higher than 5ºC of the pre-industrial level. It is not an easy job for us to keep our planet beautiful and healthy, and the only way is to reduce our green house emission. Thus, I believe that we, people, should all take responsibility for <mark>climate change</mark> no matter what roles we play in this society, and we need new technology and natural energy to maintain our daily activities. Both industries and individual should think that reducing green energy and slowing global warming are their own job. #UCIGCB2015</P></DIV></DIV></LI><LI class=""comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1"" id=""dsq-comment-51239""><DIV id=""dsq-comment-header-51239"" class=""dsq-comment-header""><CITE id=""dsq-cite-51239""><SPAN id=""dsq-author-user-51239"">Aaron</SPAN></CITE></DIV><DIV id=""dsq-comment-body-51239"" class=""dsq-comment-body""><DIV id=""dsq-comment-message-51239"" class=""dsq-comment-message""><P>“We’re making progress.

Or to look at the California example of harvesting efficiency gains.</P><P>Realistically, I don’t think policy constraints on individuals’ ability to consume will work, at least not in democratic societies, which we value for good reason.

But our new study, <A href=""http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature19082"">published today in Nature</A>, reveals that warming in some regions actually began as early as the 1830s. </P><P>That is much earlier than previously thought, so our discovery redefines our understanding of when human activity began to influence our <mark>climate</mark>. </P><P>Determining when global warming began, and how quickly the planet has warmed since then, is essential for understanding how much we have altered the <mark>climate</mark> in different parts of the world. Our study helps to answer the question of whether our <mark>climate</mark> is already operating outside thresholds that are considered safe for human society and functional ecosystems. </P><P>Our findings show that warming did not develop at the same time across the planet. The tropical oceans and the Arctic were the first regions to begin warming, in the 1830s. Europe, North America and Asia followed roughly two decades later. </P><P>Surprisingly, the results show that the southern hemisphere began warming much later, with Australasia and South America starting to warm from the early 20th century. This continental-scale time lag is still evident today: while some parts of Antarctica have begun to warm, a clear warming signal over the entire continent is still not detectable. </P><P>The warming in most regions reversed what would otherwise have been a cooling trend related to high volcanic activity during the preceding centuries. </P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">Global warming got underway much earlier in the north.</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>By pinpointing the date when human-induced <mark>climate change</mark> started, we can then begin to work out when the warming trend broke through the boundaries of the <mark>climate</mark>’s natural fluctuations, because it takes some decades for the global warming signal to “emerge” above the natural <mark>climate</mark> variability.</P><P>According to our evidence, in all regions except for Antarctica, we are now well and truly operating in a greenhouse-influenced world. We know this because the only <mark>climate</mark> models that can reproduce the results seen in our records of past <mark>climate</mark> are those models that factor in the effect of the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide released into the atmosphere by humans.</P><P>These remarkable findings were pieced together from the most unusual of sources – not thermometers or satellites, but rather from natural <mark>climate</mark> archives. These include coral skeletons, ice cores, tree rings, cave deposits and ocean and lake sediment layers, all of which record the <mark>climate</mark> as they grow or accumulate. </P><P>These archives provide long records that extend back 500 years – well before the Industrial Revolution – and provide a critical baseline for the planet’s past <mark>climate</mark>, one that is impossible to obtain otherwise. </P><FIGURE class=""align-center zoomable""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">Corals can help reveal the <mark>climate</mark> of centuries past, long before weather records began.</SPAN><SPAN class=""attribution""><SPAN class=""source"">Eric Matson/AIMS</SPAN>, <SPAN class=""license"">Author provided</SPAN></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>But why is there no clear warming fingerprint yet seen across Antarctica? The answer most likely lies in the vast Southern Ocean, which isolates the frozen continent from the warming happening elsewhere. </P><P>The westerly winds that circulate through the Southern Ocean around Antarctica keep warm air masses from lower latitudes at bay. Ozone depletion and rising greenhouse gas concentrations during the 20th century have also caused this wind barrier to get stronger. </P><P>The Southern Ocean currents that flow around Antarctica also tend to <A href=""http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v9/n7/full/ngeo2731.html"">move warmer surface waters away from the continent</A>, to be replaced with cold deeper water that hasn’t yet been affected by surface greenhouse warming. This process could potentially delay Antarctica’s warming by centuries.</P><H2>Ocean insulation</H2><P>The delay in warming observed in the rest of the southern hemisphere is something we do not yet fully understand. It could simply be because fewer records are available from the southern hemisphere, meaning that we still don’t have a full picture of what is happening. </P><P>Alternatively, like Antarctica, the southern hemisphere’s oceans could be holding back warming – partly through winds and currents, but perhaps also because of “thermal inertia”, whereby the ocean can absorb far more heat energy than the atmosphere or the land before its temperature markedly increases.

	When we talk about the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, often the first place we look is the natural world. There are polar bears dying from starvation for lack of sea ice; there are forests in the American West catching fire and burning rapidly after years of drought have dried out the vegetation. There are human costs too: the damage to homes and communities from extreme weather events that happen with more frequency and severity as the planet warms. And there’s the poor air quality that causes and exacerbates health problems, especially for children and the elderly.
	 
	These are compelling arguments for those of us already concerned about our changing planet. However, some of the best arguments to win more supporters for <mark>climate</mark> action aren’t about the environment at all. <mark>Climate change</mark> is going to cost us real, hard dollars that we just can’t afford. It’s not just taxpayers on the hook for cleanup and resilience investments. Whole industries will have to change dramatically or disappear. Here are a few that are most at risk:</P><P>
	 <STRONG>Agriculture</STRONG>
	 
	<mark>Climate change</mark>’s effect on agriculture is clear. Cultivating crops is already dependent on the <mark>climate</mark>—you wouldn’t, for instance, grow bananas in Nova Scotia. Some have argued that <mark>climate change</mark> could increase growing seasons in more northern locations.
	 
	But <mark>climate</mark> is more than temperature. Take California, which despite a wet El Nino year, still hasn’t climbed out of nearly five years of severe drought. Home to a <A href=""https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/CDFA-History.html"">$54 billion agriculture industry</A>, California produces the majority of fruits and vegetables grown and consumed in the United States. During the drought, which scientists say is aggravated by <mark>climate change</mark>, farmers were forced to let fields lay fallow or even <A href=""http://www.chicoer.com/article/zz/20140517/NEWS/140519505"">let orchards go</A> as there was little water to save the trees. Drought is expected to become more common and more severe across the West. Back east, increased <A href=""http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/WRI14_Factsheets_Heavy_Precipitation.pdf"">heavy downpours can cause massive erosion</A> of topsoil, making farms less productive and farming more expensive to replace this nutrient-rich soil.
	 <STRONG>Beverages (beer, soda, wine)</STRONG>
	 
	In 2013, alarmed by the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on hops production, water availability and other impacts, more than 20 breweries created the <A href=""http://www.ceres.org/declaration/about/<mark>climate</mark>-declaration-campaigns/brewery"">Brewery <mark>Climate</mark> Declaration</A>, which both advocates for <mark>climate</mark> action and commits signatories to making their operations greener. As of 2015, their numbers had nearly doubled. Winemakers may feel the impacts even more. As any winery tour will explain, grapevines’ production and quality varies from one side of a hill to another. The <mark>climate change</mark>s that affect temperatures, precipitation patterns and growth schedules pose a much larger threat to wineries around the world. BuzzFeed’s dramatic headline <A href=""https://www.buzzfeed.com/sandraeallen/how-<mark>climate</mark>-change-will-end-wine-as-we-know-it#.uqMrKDaxa""><EM>How <mark>Climate Change</mark> Will End Wine As We Know It</EM></A> isn’t quite as hyperbolic as you’d think.
	 
	It’s not just alcohol at risk. Beverage industries, obviously dependent on water, face serious challenges as <mark>climate</mark> patterns change and cause water scarcity, leading to increased costs for beverage companies. Recognizing the threats to its business and supply chain, Coca-Cola, a strong <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/27/<mark>climate</mark>-change-obama-coca-cola-walmart-google"">supporter of the Obama Administration’s</A> <mark>climate</mark> agenda, released a <A href=""http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/position-statement-on-<mark>climate</mark>-protection/""><mark>climate</mark> statement</A> outlining its concern and actions the company will take to reduce its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint through energy efficiency, renewable energy and even <A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/coca-cola-commits-to-<mark>climate</mark>-f/""><mark>climate</mark>-friendly refrigeration</A>.
	 <STRONG>Fishing</STRONG>
	 
	One of the most insidious and least discussed impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> is ocean acidification. As humans spew more <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into the atmosphere, the ocean absorbs lots of it. The good news is that this slows global warming a bit by removing some greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The bad news is that <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide changes the pH of the ocean which is already making it harder for some species to survive.
	 
	Shellfish are some of the biggest losers. As the ocean acidifies, it becomes harder for shellfish to create and keep their calcium-based shells. That’s bad for fishermen and companies that rely on this catch for their livelihoods. Warmer and acidic waters affect other fish too. Some species are moving to deeper waters or even closer to the poles, meaning <A href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/17/ocean-<mark>climate</mark>-change-fishing-industry_n_3275505.html"">local fishing communities are left without their catch</A>. Declines in fisheries have led governments to enact strict catch limits to hold off population collapse, but that’s made it hard for some fishermen to make a living.
	 <STRONG>Winter Sports</STRONG>
	 
	For the third year in a row, the Iditarod Dog Sled Race could only ceremonially start in Anchorage, Alaska. Too little snow that far “south” forced mushers and dogs to move north to an altered course that would be safer for humans and animals. Of course, not many of us are professional mushers, but all industries that rely on snow should be seriously concerned about a warming world. Protect Our Winters, an organization of professional skiers and snowboarders, estimates the downhill ski resort industry <A href=""http://protectourwinters.org/<mark>climate</mark>-science-and-solutions/"">lost more than $1 billion</A> in the first decade of the 21st century between high and low snowfall years. In 2015, Squaw Valley near Lake Tahoe had received just <A href=""http://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/15061512-113/poor-snow-causes-squaw-valley-to-cancels-march-4-8-fis"">one-third of its annual average</A> by February, forcing it to <A href=""http://www.outsideonline.com/1807361/squaw-valley-cancels-world-cup-cross-events"">cancel its World Cup cross events</A>. Even in Canada, resorts have been <A href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/castle-mountain-resort-in-mid-week-shutdown-over-unseasonable-weather-1.2952008"">forced to shut down early</A> due to unseasonably warm weather.
	 
	The impacts on the sport obviously have ripple effects. Winter apparel companies, ski equipment, snowboard and other manufacturers and winter goods-providers also suffer when fewer people are able to enjoy winter sports—so too do shops and restaurants in ski towns who rely on winter sports tourists for business.
	 <STRONG>Insurance</STRONG>
	 
	Insurance companies, in a way, are highly effective gamblers. They create complex models that weigh the odds of any array of disasters happening to their customers and set their rates based on the likelihood that they’ll have to make big payouts in any given year. <mark>Climate change</mark> blows these models up. In 2005, home insurers <A href=""http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southcentral/2015/08/26/379650.htm"">lost $8 billion</A> after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which collectively caused more than $40 billion in insured losses. Just seven years later, Superstorm Sandy resulted in more than <A href=""http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/east/2013/10/29/309538.htm"">$18 billion in insurance payouts</A>. Insurers know some years will be worse than others, but as these 100-year storms (so-called because they are only supposed to happen once every 100 years) increase in frequency, something will have to change—profits, premiums or the ability to insure some things and places at all.
	 
	Reinsurance companies—businesses that insure insurers, kind of like hedging bets—get this. Munich Re and Swiss Re, two of the largest, have been <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/business/insurers-stray-from-the-conservative-line-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change.html"">outspoken about <mark>climate</mark> impacts</A> (acknowledging that <mark>climate change</mark> is caused by humans) and started incorporating <mark>climate change</mark> into their models and encourage more resilience and <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> mitigation.
	 
	Businesses focus on the bottom line, and when it comes to <mark>climate change</mark>, the bottom line is businesses know we need to act. While the above industries face acute risks, the economy is large and dynamic, and <mark>climate change</mark> will have ripple effects that impact everyone. Many companies are already doing something about it. <A href=""http://www.ceres.org/bicep""><SPAN class=""caps"">BICEP</SPAN></A> is a coalition of more than 365 companies under the business sustainability organization Ceres that support the Clean Power Plan and real <mark>climate</mark> action. The stronger their voices become and larger their numbers grow, the more pressure politicians and regulators will face to act and the better chance we’ll all have of weathering the physical and economic impacts of global warming. 
	 
	In considering the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on various industries, it’s difficult to ignore the one that will need to change the most in order to minimize <mark>climate</mark> impacts—energy. According to a <A href=""http://www.environmentamericacenter.org/reports/ame/we-have-power"">recent report by Environment America</A>, the United States has the potential to meet 100 percent of its energy needs with renewables. Not only does the <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> have access to vast energy reserves in the form of wind, sun, earth and oceans, but renewables reduce the need for using dangerous energy extraction methods. With energy leading the way, other industries may also reap the benefits and work toward mitigating the negative consequences of <mark>climate change</mark>.

You/<EM>Science</EM>; (Data Source) Richard Heede</P></DIV></FIGURE></DIV><P>The results showed that nearly two-thirds of the major industrial greenhouse gas emissions (from fossil fuel use, methane leaks, and cement manufacture) originated in just 90 companies around the world, which either emitted the <mark>carbon</mark> themselves or supplied <mark>carbon</mark> ultimately released by consumers and industry. As Heede told <EM>The Guardian</EM> newspaper, you could take all the decision-makers and CEOs of these companies and fit them on a couple Greyhound buses.</P><P>The study provoked controversy when it was published in 2013, with some complaining that it unfairly held the fossil fuel industry responsible for the lifestyle choices made by billions of consumers. &quot;It's a cop-out to blame the producers of products that we have demanded, and benefited from, for more than a century,&quot; wrote Severin Borenstein, a business and public policy expert at the University of California (UC), Berkeley, in a blog post.</P><P>Others, however, saw the study as a turning point in the debate about apportioning responsibility for <mark>climate change</mark>. With traditional environmental issues, such as river <mark>pollution</mark> or toxic waste, it has always been possible to identify perpetrators who could be targeted for regulation or enforcement. But greenhouse gases are emitted everywhere, in every process that involves combustion. &quot;For decades there's been a persistent myth that everyone is responsible, and if everyone is responsible then no one is responsible,&quot; says Carroll Muffett, president and CEO of the Center for International Environmental Law in Washington, D.C., who also serves on the board of a nonprofit that Heede co-founded. &quot;Rick's work for the first time identifies a discrete class of defendants.&quot;</P><P>Heede's <mark>carbon</mark> accounting is already opening a new chapter in <mark>climate change</mark> litigation and policy, helping equip plaintiffs who believe they have suffered damages from <mark>climate change</mark> to claim compensation. &quot;Rick's work really helps connect the dots,&quot; says Marco Simons, general counsel of EarthRights International, a Washington, D.C.-based legal group that defends the rights of the poor. &quot;He hasn't sought out the spotlight, but I think his work is tremendously important.&quot;</P><H2>Counting <mark>Carbon</mark></H2><P>Heede tallies <mark>carbon</mark> obsessively. When we discussed my plans to fly out from Boston to Sausalito, California, where his houseboat is anchored, he did a quick calculation and told me that my share of the flights would add 716 kilograms of <mark>carbon</mark> to the atmosphere. &quot;And if you'd driven an average car the trip would be 1.78 tons of CO<SUB>2</SUB> [<mark>carbon</mark> dioxide]&quot; he added, apparently riffing on his own compulsiveness. During my visit I noticed that when he boiled water to make noodles for lunch he put a frying pan on the pot instead of a lid—to preheat the pan so it would use a tiny bit less fuel to heat up the stir-fry. &quot;It's a practice of mine to figure out how I can minimize energy use.&quot;</P><P>He was born in Norway into a long line of watchmakers, which may contribute to his own meticulousness. At 15, he and his parents immigrated to the United States. His father was a consulting engineer, but the younger Heede wasn't keen on &quot;fixing problems that should not have been created in the first place&quot;—which, he admits, is exactly what he's doing these days.</P><P>Heede has spent most of his life in Colorado, and he has the solid build and weathered face of someone who has spent lots of time in the mountains. He earned undergraduate and master's degrees in geography at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and then joined forces with Amory Lovins, the soft-energy guru who co-founded the Rocky Mountain Institute in Boulder. Ronald Reagan had just been elected president, and his administration moved to gut subsidies for alternative energy sources, claiming that they were not economically competitive. Heede tested that assertion, analyzing the federal budget to find the hidden subsidies to the coal and oil industries, even including the cost of treating workers who developed black lung disease from coal mining.</P><P>Contrary to Reagan administration claims, Heede showed that the vast bulk of federal energy subsidies went to conventional energy sources. He wrote a report, testified to Congress, and wrote an opinion piece in <EM>The Wall Street Journal</EM>. &quot;I don't recall getting any calls as a result,&quot; he says. It was an early taste of working in obscurity.</P><P>In 2003, he left the Rocky Mountain Institute to form <mark>Climate</mark> Mitigation Services, a consulting firm specializing in surveying and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. One of his early clients was Aspen, Colorado, a rich and progressive ski town whose leaders wanted to act decisively to reduce emissions. They hired Heede to do a baseline greenhouse gas inventory with the broadest possible scope—including not only activities within the city, but the cars and airplanes that annually brought in hundreds of thousands of tourists … in short, Heede recalls, &quot;everything that uses energy as a result of Aspen's existence.&quot;</P><P>The exercise raised fascinating questions, Heede says: &quot;What is a community, and what is a boundary? There's leakage everywhere: airplanes, trucks, cars, visitors. How do you quantify that stuff?&quot;</P><P>Heede interviewed airport managers and checked their logs to find out which aircraft served the more than 178,000 annual passengers, calculating fuel consumption and emissions for each flight. Standing at the main bridge into Aspen for hours at a time, he categorized the cars that went by—sedans, SUVs, trucks, vans. Then, he used his records to estimate emissions from the 13,000 vehicles tabulated by an automated counter each day. In the end, he determined that in 2004, Aspen was responsible for more than 840,000 tons of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions—&quot;roughly equivalent to a large, diesel-powered aircraft carrier running flank speed at all times.&quot; This and subsequent reports enabled the city to reduce its emissions despite a growing population and economy.</P><H2>The <mark>carbon</mark> ripples</H2><P>Aspen was an early test of Heede's ability to gather information and see beyond obvious boundaries—the invisible ripples from every project that affect the infinitely interconnected atmosphere. In the early 2000s, for example, an Australian firm proposed building a liquefied natural gas terminal off the California coast. It seemed a good way to transition to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> &quot;bridge&quot; fuel. But, Heede says, &quot;They hadn't done any work on life cycle emissions.&quot; When he tallied all the direct and indirect emissions—from the gas extraction in Australia to distribution in California—he found that the project would have produced nearly a third more <mark>carbon</mark> than anticipated. His analysis helped persuade California officials to vote it down.</P><P>Later, he tackled targets that produce bigger but more diffuse ripples. Several U.S. cities and environmental groups were suing the Export-Import Bank of the United States and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, alleging the institutions were financing projects that would damage Earth's <mark>climate</mark>. The plaintiffs retained Heede to analyze the <mark>carbon</mark> emissions resulting from the banks' loans and investments around the world, from a gas project in Central Africa to a coal mine in Poland. He found that the projects were directly and indirectly emitting nearly 2 billion metric tons of CO<SUB>2</SUB> per year—almost 8% of the world's emissions. The plaintiffs won: The banks agreed to conduct environmental impact statements, create <mark>carbon</mark>-sensitive policies, and increase their financing of renewable energy projects.</P><P>Meanwhile, a new idea was coalescing in the environmental law community. For years, attorneys had litigated so-called environmental justice cases to redress the fact that poor people disproportionately suffer from <mark>pollution</mark>. By the early 2000s, it was becoming clear that the poor will also face the heaviest impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>. But how do you structure a liability case when the entire world takes part in the <mark>carbon</mark> economy? Can a Pacific Islander whose town has been flooded sue 7 billion people? Searching for more specific culprits, Peter Roderick, head of the <mark>Climate</mark> Justice Programme for Greenpeace International in London, commissioned Heede to study ExxonMobil and quantify total greenhouse emissions across its history.</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""pullquote""><P>Frankly, we're all the users and therefore we're all guilty.</P><FOOTER>
  
      David Victor, University of California, San Diego  
</FOOTER></BLOCKQUOTE><P>He would have to follow a tangled corporate path. Founded as Standard Oil by John D. Rockefeller in 1870, the company became one of the world's largest multinationals until 1911, when the Supreme Court split it into several &quot;baby Standards.&quot; Decades later, two of the largest of those firms merged to form ExxonMobil. Heede tracked down production figures in annual reports scattered among university archives on two continents, supplemented by court documents, news reports, and academic and industry papers. Then he converted production volumes to CO<SUB>2</SUB> and methane. He included direct emissions, for instance from the fuels used to run the company's operations, and indirect emissions released by the combustion of its products.</P><P>After 15 months of research, Heede concluded that ExxonMobil and its precursors had directly or indirectly emitted 20.3 billion metric tons of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and 199 million metric tons of methane. Friends of the Earth calculated that the quantity represented between 4.7% and 5.3% of humanity's industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1882.</P><P>&quot;I thought, 'This is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind,'&quot; Roderick recalls. &quot;But I knew it was just a small part of the big picture.&quot;</P><H2>The major league</H2><P>Roderick commissioned Heede to look at the entire fossil fuel industry. To make the project manageable, they limited it to companies that produced at least 8 million tons of <mark>carbon</mark> per year, the so-called &quot;<mark>carbon</mark> majors.&quot; The research took 8 years. Money from the original grant ran out, and after the crash of 2008 Heede's consulting business collapsed. He maxed out his credit card, borrowed against his Colorado house, and scraped by, enlisting graduate students in several countries to photocopy and send him papers, which he checked and double-checked with a watchmaker's precision. He filled shelves with binders of information and spent thousands of hours entering it into spreadsheets, working alone, often until midnight. &quot;I take pleasure in that kind of stuff,&quot; Heede says. &quot;I like to pay attention to detail.&quot;</P><P>Sitting at dual monitors in the captain's cabin of his houseboat, Heede takes me on a tour of his data set, a seemingly endless series of color-coded and cross-indexed spreadsheets. Each sheet lists hundreds of entries, with columns showing the year and total production volumes for products such as crude oil, natural gas, and varieties of coal. Clicking on a company's name opens additional spreadsheets with the company's year-by-year production, plus screenshots of its annual reports for verification. Color-coded flowcharts display the evolution of companies as they separated or merged. The flowcharts from Russia are particularly ornate, as they incorporate the transformation of companies after the fall of the Soviet Union. (Heede got production data for the Soviet companies from Central Intelligence Agency analyses and the International Energy Agency.) Detailed annotations reveal his methods and calculations. The structure of these charts, so layered and interlocking, seems almost medieval in its complexity, and Heede seems monklike in his devotion to compiling it.</P><P>The result, peer reviewed and published in <EM>Climatic Change</EM>, showed that just 90 companies contributed 63% of the greenhouse gases emitted globally between 1751 and 2010. Half of those emissions took place after 1988—the year James Hansen of NASA testified to Congress that there was no longer any doubt that global warming had begun.</P><P>The data &quot;just blew me away,&quot; says Naomi Oreskes, a science historian at Harvard University and co-author of the book <EM>Merchants of Doubt</EM>, which compares the fossil fuel industry to the tobacco industry in its efforts to raise doubts about science. &quot;Everyone talks about this as a problem since the Industrial Revolution, but I now think that's incorrect,&quot; she says. Heede has shown that the roots of the problem are more recent and easier to trace. In 2011, Oreskes joined Heede in creating the <mark>Climate</mark> Accountability Institute, a nonprofit devoted to quantifying the contribution of fossil fuel companies to <mark>climate change</mark> and investigating their alleged attempts to obfuscate the science.</P><H2>Sharing the blame</H2><P>Other people criticize the work as oversimplified and naïve. David Victor, a political scientist and energy policy specialist at UC San Diego and a co-author of the 2015 Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> report, doesn't question Heede's numbers but says his approach is wrongheaded. &quot;It's part of a larger narrative of trying to create villains; to draw lines between producers as responsible for the problem and everyone else as victims. Frankly, we're all the users and therefore we're all guilty. To create a narrative that involves corporate guilt as opposed to problem-solving is not going to solve anything.&quot;</P><P>Heede concedes that the responsibility is shared. &quot;I as a consumer bear some responsibility for my own car, etcetera. But we're living an illusion if we think we're making choices, because the infrastructure pretty much makes those choices for us.&quot; He focused on fossil fuel companies, he says, because unlike industries that produce greenhouse gases as a byproduct (such as the automobile industry, which has adhered to increasingly strict mileage standards), the mission of fossil fuel companies is to pull <mark>carbon</mark> out of the ground and put it into commerce.</P><P>His data, together with an emerging line of research that uses computer models to discern how likely it is that a given storm, flood, or heat wave was related to human-caused emissions, are now driving efforts to allocate responsibility for <mark>climate change</mark>. Last year, for instance, several nongovernmental organizations in the Philippines filed a petition with that nation's Commission on Human Rights. It asks the &quot;<mark>carbon</mark> majors&quot; to take remedial actions on behalf of typhoon survivors in the islands, which suffer devastating storms that may have worsened as a result of <mark>climate change</mark>. &quot;Heede's report is one of the bedrock pieces of science and research that helped form our campaign,&quot; says Kristin Casper, litigation counsel for Greenpeace's Global <mark>Climate</mark> Justice and Liability Project in Toronto, Canada. In late July, the commission sent orders to 47 of the world's largest investor-owned fossil fuel companies, asking them to respond to the human rights charges in the petition. Similar actions and lawsuits are proceeding in several other countries.</P><P>Now, Heede is extending his <mark>carbon</mark> accounting into the future, quantifying the potential <mark>carbon</mark> release from future fossil fuel exploration. Like the other recipients of Representative Smith's subpoena, he has no intention of complying with what he calls a &quot;campaign to intimidate us and stop scientific research.&quot; At the same time, he confesses an admiration for the fossil fuel industry, which has made &quot;fantastic efforts to find resources for the betterment of humanity,&quot; often in the harshest environments. They've done such a good job that we haven't paused to reflect on the unintended consequences, he says. &quot;And now we have to cope with the result.&quot;</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Over the years, the demand for tires that delivered better performance at a lower price inspired makers to add artificial ingredients — synthetic rubber and special additives that chemists cooked up from crude <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/info/oil/?inline=nyt-classifier"" title=""More articles about oil."" class=""meta-classifier"">oil</A> — to the mix.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""538"" data-total-count=""2874"">A century later, the research laboratories at several tire makers are making progress toward reversing the trend of increased petroleum content. One of the first to pursue this path was <mark>Sumitomo Rubber Industries</mark>, which has a global alliance with Goodyear in the Dunlop brand, for the Enasave tire it introduced in Japan in 2006. Among other changes, Sumitomo engineers substantially reduced the amount of petrochemicals by cutting the amount of  synthetic rubber in half, to 11 percent of the tire’s composition from about 22 percent.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""371"" data-total-count=""3245"">A company spokesman, Masatoshi Hayashi, said that the replacement material was a chemically modified natural rubber, chosen to offset the tendency of tires with a high natural rubber content to have poor traction in braking and cornering. To overcome this problem, the engineers altered the rubber chemically to produce a rubber compound with better grip in hard driving.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""357"" data-total-count=""3602"">Sumitomo also cut back the amount of <mark>carbon</mark> black filler (usually produced from oil, coal or charcoal) in the Enasave’s tread compound while increasing the amount of fuel-saving silica filler, Mr. Hayashi said. Vegetable processing oil was substituted for its petroleum equivalent, and the compounds were reinforced with fibers made from plant cellulose.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""238"" data-total-count=""3840"">Sumitomo has continued development. In 2008, the company introduced a prototype Enasave tire using ingredients that were 97 percent nonpetroleum-based, and by 2013 it hopes to market a new tire line that contains no petrochemicals at all.</P><FIGURE id=""media-100000000266275"" class=""media photo embedded layout-large-vertical media-100000000266275"" data-media-action=""modal"" itemprop=""associatedMedia"" itemscope="""" itemid=""https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/06/20/automobiles/TIRE-2/TIRE-2-popup.jpg"" itemtype=""http://schema.org/ImageObject"" aria-label=""media"" role=""group""><SPAN class=""visually-hidden"">Photo</SPAN><FIGCAPTION class=""caption"" itemprop=""caption description""><SPAN class=""caption-text"">Engineers reduced the amount of petrochemicals in a prototpe Goodyear tire by cutting the amount of synthetic rubber in half.</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""419"" data-total-count=""4259"">Engineers at Yokohama Tire, working toward a similar goal, have come up with tires that are 80 percent petroleum-free, the company’s director of technical services, Dan Guiney, said. The Yokohama dB Super E-spec, introduced in Japan in 2007, uses chemically modified natural rubber and a processing oil that is derived from orange peels. The peels are shipped from orange juice factories near the tire plant in Japan.</P><DIV id=""story-ad-2"" class=""story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ""><DIV class=""accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden""><P>Advertisement</P></DIV><A class=""visually-hidden skip-to-text-link"" href=""#story-continues-4"">Continue reading the main story</A></DIV><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""478"" data-total-count=""4737"" id=""story-continues-4"">In steady driving conditions, the orange oil compound works to reduce rolling resistance by about a fifth over conventional treads, Mr. Guiney said, but in cornering and braking maneuvers it quickly generates heat that softens the rubber tread to deliver better grip. The orange oil-infused tire went on sale in the United States last year, and the same technology is used in Yokohama’s Advan ENV-R1 racing slick, which is the specified tire for sports car roadracing series.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""358"" data-total-count=""5095"">A nonpetroleum oil — this one more commonly found in the kitchen — has also become an ingredient in Michelin’s tires. The Primacy MXM4 all-weather tire, supplied as original equipment on several Mercedes-Benz and Infiniti models, uses sunflower oil in its formulation for improved traction at low temperatures and shorter braking distances in the wet.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""481"" data-total-count=""5576"">Tire companies are investigating more speculative ways to use <mark>sustainable</mark> and renewable rubber formulations, including latex derived from alternative sources, said Harold J. Herzlich, a tire engineering and chemistry consultant. Lesser-known plants like guayule, a desert shrub, and Russian dandelion, the central Asian version of our lawn weed, could one day help the tire industry protect itself from the uncertain supplies and fluctuating prices of natural rubber and crude oil.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""366"" data-total-count=""5942"">Goodyear has taken a different approach to dealing with these matters. Researchers there developed a method to produce synthetic rubber by modifying isoprene, a hydro<mark>carbon</mark> molecule that is a byproduct of petroleum refining. Changes in oil refinery practices have reduced the availability of this raw material, however, leading the company to look for alternatives.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""331"" data-total-count=""6273"">In 2007, Goodyear entered into a research collaboration with an industrial biotechnology company, Genencor, to use engineered micro-organisms to produce isoprene. Genencor scientists have since succeeded in developing a product that the company calls BioIsoprene, which it says is chemically identical to petroleum-based isoprene.</P><FIGURE id=""media-100000000266276"" class=""media photo embedded layout-large-vertical media-100000000266276"" data-media-action=""modal"" itemprop=""associatedMedia"" itemscope="""" itemid=""https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/06/20/automobiles/TIRE-3/TIRE-3-popup.jpg"" itemtype=""http://schema.org/ImageObject"" aria-label=""media"" role=""group""><SPAN class=""visually-hidden"">Photo</SPAN><FIGCAPTION class=""caption"" itemprop=""caption description""><SPAN class=""caption-text"">Yokohama’s Advan racing tire contains oil from oranges.</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""357"" data-total-count=""6630"">“The cells ferment <mark>sustainable</mark> carbohydrates into isoprene in a processing vat,” said Rich LaDuca, senior director of business development at Genencor, which is a division of Danisco, a Denmark-based maker of food ingredients. “But since isoprene is volatile, it bubbles out of the broth as a gas, which results in a very pure, high-yield product.”</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""295"" data-total-count=""6925"">At this point, only a handful of prototype tires have been made, but Genencor is preparing to build a pilot plant in 2011 to brew more BioIsoprene, which it plans to sell to Goodyear and the rest of the tire industry. Goodyear says it expects to have tires suitable for road testing in mid-2011.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""225"" data-total-count=""7150"">Elsewhere, researchers at Oregon State University have been working with an organic substance that can be made from various plant fibers, microcrystalline cellulose, which could partly replace silica as a reinforcing filler.</P><DIV id=""story-ad-3"" class=""story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ""><DIV class=""accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden""><P>Advertisement</P></DIV><A class=""visually-hidden skip-to-text-link"" href=""#story-continues-5"">Continue reading the main story</A></DIV><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""322"" data-total-count=""7472"" id=""story-continues-5"">Silica filler is a costly, sophisticated material that requires a lot of energy to produce. The Oregon team successfully replaced as much as 12 percent of the silica used in low-rolling-resistance tires without degrading performance. More research is needed to confirm the long-term durability of these tire formulations.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""306"" data-total-count=""7778"">Somewhat more subtle is the effect of new production machines that can hold much closer manufacturing tolerances, Mr. Herzlich said. As tire plants retool, new equipment lets them fabricate tires with much greater precision, which saves weight because only the required materials are included in the tire.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""138"" data-total-count=""7916"">“If you take a half ounce out of a tire it saves a tremendous amount of fuel because it makes it easier to rotate the wheel,” he said.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""318"" data-total-count=""8234"">Efforts are growing in the meantime to recycle a greater fraction of the estimated 300 million tires that domestic drivers discard each year. “More and more of the recycled tire rubber is reprocessed and reused for many purposes,” Mr. Herzlich said. “And some of these recycled materials are reused in tires.”</P><FOOTER class=""story-footer story-content""><DIV class=""story-meta""><P class=""story-print-citation"">A version of this article appears in print on June 20, 2010, on Page AU7 of the <SPAN itemprop=""printEdition"">New York edition</SPAN> with the headline: Recipe for Green Tires: Plants, Not Petroleum. <SPAN class=""story-footer-links""><SPAN><A href=""http://www.nytreprints.com/"" target=""_blank"">Order Reprints</A><SPAN class=""pipe"">|</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Today's Paper</A><SPAN class=""pipe"">|</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp839RF.html?campaignId=48JQY"" target=""_blank"">Subscribe</A></SPAN></SPAN></P></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Accordingly, the U.S. dollar was determined to be the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiary. All gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of its financial statements since January 1, 2010 were determined using official exchange rates and are reported in Other Expense. Venezuela remained a highly inflationary economy for U.S. GAAP purposes during 2012. On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency, the bolivar fuerte, effective February 13, 2013.  The announcement indicated that the official exchange rate would be changed from 4.3 bolivares fuertes to each U.S. dollar to 6.3 bolivares fuertes to each U.S. dollar. As a result, we expect to record a charge in the first quarter of 2013 in connection with the remeasurement of our balance sheet to reflect the devaluation.

Our amended and restated $2.0 billion first lien revolving credit facility is available in the form of loans or letters of credit, with letter of credit availability limited to $800 million.

Modifications are based on the results of periodic collateral and borrowing base evaluations and appraisals. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory decline, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under the facility may decrease below $2.0 billion.

Amyris, Inc. <A href=""http://investors.amyris.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1015996"">announced</A> that <mark>Sumitomo Rubber Industries</mark>, Ltd. has adopted Amyris’ liquid farnesene rubber (LFR) as a performance-enhancing additive for use in the production of its latest Dunlop-branded Winter Maxx 02 tires. LFR is a liquid rubber developed by Kuraray Co. using Amyris’s biologically derived Biofene-branded β-farnesene. (<A href=""http://www.greencarcongress.com/2016/12/20161202-amyris.html"">Earlier post</A>.)
</P><P>
The Winter Maxx 02 represents the brand’s best tire to date for on-ice and snow-braking performance and for durability. LFR’s performance enhancement will be available across Dunlop’s entire Winter Maxx 02 portfolio of 91 sizes.
</P></DIV><DIV class=""entry-more font-entrybody""><BLOCKQUOTE><P><EM>We are excited to join with Kuraray in bringing LFR to the large global tire market and commercializing safer high-performance tires that utilize an additive from a <mark>sustainable</mark> resource. This marks the first global tire brand to adopt our disruptive technology to deliver <mark>innovation</mark>. The better than expected results from this first launch are leading to significantly better early sales of LFR than we expected. We expect this commercial entry is just the start of anticipated adoption by other major brands across the world.</EM></P><DIV align=""right"">—John Melo, President &amp; CEO of Amyris</DIV></BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Amyris’s sugar cane-derived Biofene forms the basis for a wide range of products varying from specialty products such as cosmetics, perfumes, detergents and industrial lubricants, to transportation fuels such as diesel and jet fuel. As a tailor-made pure hydro<mark>carbon</mark> it provides numerous advantages when compared to petroleum-based oils and chemicals and is renewable.
</P><P>
LFR is a proprietary liquid rubber using farnesene manufactured from sugar cane using fermentation technology. It features a viscosity that is much lower compared with current liquid isoprene rubber, making it easier for rubber product manufacturers to use. In addition, it maintains excellent flexibility, even at low temperatures.
</P><P>
Its unique chemical structure reacts completely with solid rubber during processing, meaning that, unlike oil additives it stays bonded, keeping tires softer, longer. In tires, its ice grip performance is maintained over many years.
</P><P>
Kuraray was established in 1926. In 1950, the company achieved a corporate milestone as the first in the world to bring polyvinyl alcohol synthetic fiber to market. In subsequent years, Kuraray used its proprietary technology in the area of polymer chemistry and synthetic chemistry to develop resins, chemicals, fibers and textiles, and other products for use in a wide variety of end applications. Kuraray has overseas subsidiaries in 19 countries.
</P><P>
Kuraray concluded a joint-development agreement with Amyris in 2011, and together created technology that refines Amyris’s biomass material farnesene to a level of purity suitable for polymerization as well as technology that synthesizes LFR. The companies discovered relationships between various properties when combining LFR’s molecular structure with rubber compounds and began supplying LFR to tire manufacturers. Following the success of this partnership, in December 2016, Kuraray and Amyris signed a multi-year collaboration extension, which includes joint marketing of products to industry and end customers.
</P><P>
Amyris converts plant sugars into hydro<mark>carbon</mark> molecules and produce specialty ingredients and consumer products. The company is delivering its No Compromise products across a number of markets, including specialty and performance chemicals, flavors and fragrances, cosmetics ingredients, pharmaceuticals, and nutraceuticals.

This new technology development concept aims to aid in the development of tyres that provide balanced Safety and Environmental performance at higher levels than ever before so that we may fulfill the requirements of the mobility society of the future.</SPAN><SPAN>The business <mark>climate</mark> facing the automotive industry is currently undergoing massive changes-what with growing concern over environmental issues, shifting demographics brought about by increasingly urbanized and aging societies and revolutionary new technologies such as AI and IoT. At the same time, we are also witnessing the nascent emergence of a new mobility society as seen in the increasing prevalence of vehicles that are more convenient and friendlier to the environment. In response to these same changes, the tyre industry is also undergoing a major transition. And so, in order to realize &quot;Even Greater Safety&quot; and &quot;Even Higher Environmental Performance,&quot; <mark>Sumitomo Rubber Industries</mark> has launched our SMART TYRE CONCEPT, a technology development concept for the development of new tyres for the dawn of a new era.</SPAN><SPAN>Our SMART TYRE CONCEPT is composed of three major technology categories: &quot;Safety Technologies&quot; to support greater safety, &quot;ENASAVE Technologies&quot; to make positive contributions to the environment and &quot;Core Technologies&quot; to support all of these efforts through the utilization of cutting-edge simulation and analysis technologies. In our DUNLOP Booth at the 45th Tokyo Motor Show 2017, <mark>Sumitomo Rubber Industries</mark> is introducing five of the research and development trends at the heart of our SMART TYRE CONCEPT: &quot;Sensing Core,&quot; &quot;Active Tread,&quot; &quot;Performance Sustaining Technology,&quot; &quot;Airless Tyres&quot; and &quot;LCA (Life Cycle Assessment).&quot;</SPAN><SPAN>In 2020, our company plans to begin mass production of a new tyre that incorporates Performance Sustaining Technology to maintain the performance of a tyre like brand new for longer. That same year, we also plan to unveil a concept tyre that incorporates LCA, adopting new materials designed to enhance environmental performance throughout the entire lifecycle of a tyre-from raw materials and tyre production to shipping, usage and even recycling. Next, in 2023, we plan to unveil a new concept tyre that incorporates our Active Tread Technology, which will enable it to demonstrate the same high level of performance regardless of whether driving on dry roads or under any other type of road condition. <mark>Sumitomo Rubber Industries</mark> will continue these and other research and development efforts towards accomplishing our goal of creating an all-new tyre that incorporates all of our SMART TYRE CONCEPT technologies by the latter half of the next decade.</SPAN></SPAN></P></TD></TR><TR><TH style=""display: none""> </TH></TR><TR><TD style=""width: 645px; background: no-repeat left top""><SPAN style=""font-size: 13px""><SPAN>[The 3 Key Technologies That Make up SMART TYRE CONCEPT]</SPAN></SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD align=""left"" style=""width: 645px; background: no-repeat left top""><SPAN style=""font-size: 13px""><SPAN>[5 Development Trends at the Heart of SMART TYRE CONCEPT]</SPAN></SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD align=""left"" style=""width: 645px; background: no-repeat left top""><SPAN style=""font-size: 13px""><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline""><SPAN>Safety Technology (1) : Sensing Core</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD align=""left"" style=""width: 645px; background: no-repeat left top""><SPAN style=""font-size: 13px""><SPAN>First unveiled in May of this year, Sensing Core is an innovative new sensing technology that transforms tyres into sensors-simply by installing our proprietary algorithm in the ECU (Engine Control Unit) in a vehicle's brakes. Sensing Core is able to detect slipperiness and other road conditions as well as tyre conditions such as wear, load and air pressure. This data is collected and processed not only for vehicle control purposes, but also for cloud-based big data analysis of information pulled from sources in the same geographic area or even society at large. Further, all of this data is then provided as feedback to the vehicle so that potential hazards arising from road or tyre conditions can be detected in advance and avoided entirely.</SPAN></SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><SPAN style=""font-size: 13px""><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline""><SPAN>Safety Technology (2) : Active Tread</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN style=""font-size: 13px""><SPAN>With the shift toward autonomous vehicles, the role of human beings in ensuring safe transportation will shrink as vehicles themselves take on a wider range of responsibilities.

We have already put Performance Sustaining Technology to practical use in our DUNLOP WINTER MAXX 02 studless tyres, which we released on the market last year. WINTER MAXX 02 tyres feature Liquid Farnesene Rubber, a high-performance biomass material designed to be effective in maintaining rubber suppleness, which allows these tyres to maintain high on-ice performance for longer periods of time. In the future, we will continue working on research and development to suppress the degradation of tyre performance on multiple fronts, such as the development of new materials that enable rubber to control and recover from internal structural deformation and that compensate for functionality that has been lost due to rubber deterioration.</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN style=""font-size: 13px""><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline""><SPAN>Safety Technology (4) : Airless Tyres</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN style=""font-size: 13px""><SPAN>Having unveiled our prototype GYROBLADE airless tyre at the 2015 Tokyo Motor Show, <mark>Sumitomo Rubber Industries</mark> is moving forward with research and development to bring tyres that do not require inflation to market.

It is hard to escape the bleak sight of coal-colored mountains of used tires that blight the U.S. landscape. But like other parts of the automobile, the tire has been partially reworked during the past decade to make it more ecologically <mark>sustainable</mark>. As a result of efforts by tire industry chemists and engineers, many of today’s tires roll more easily to save fuel and contain fewer petroleum-based ingredients, both of which shrink this difficult technology's <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. The work to green the tire further will continue.
When global <mark>climate change</mark> began to grab headlines some years ago, tire industry researchers analyzed the car tire's total lifetime (&quot;wells-to-wheels&quot;) environmental impact to help determine how it might be improved. They found that the aspect of the tire that contributes the most to greenhouse gas emissions—around 86 percent of its effect—is related to the amount of the extra fuel that tires cause engines to burn to overcome the rubber's resistance to rolling, says Forrest Patterson, technical director for passenger cars and light truck tires at <A href=""http://www.michelin-us.com/"">Michelin North America</A> in Greenville, S.C. Every 3.8 liters (gallon) of oil that remains unburned keeps 8.2 kilograms (18 pounds) of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide out the air.
Tire companies responded initially by developing low rolling resistance tires that generate about 5 percent less friction as they rotate on the pavement, which can boost fuel economy by as much as 4 to 8 percent over regular models. Over the lifetime of a tire, &quot;we could be talking about saving from 10 to 80 gallons [40 to 300 liters] of gasoline&quot; this way, Patterson says. They also set about encouraging motorists to maintain full inflation pressures.
But now tire-makers have turned increasingly to finding renewably sourced raw materials to replace current oil-based ingredients of tires. Depending on the model, anywhere from 15 to 38 liters of petroleum are required to produce a standard tire. Low-oil content tires use various natural, <mark>sustainable</mark> ingredients as substitutes including chemically toughened natural <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=origin-rubber-boots-amazonian-indians-goodyear"">rubbers</A>, vegetable-based processing oils and fibers made of <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=cellulose-success"">plant cellulose</A>. They also found nonpetroleum versions of what the tire industry calls fillers—special functional additives that boost, for example, manufacturing processability or durability.
Tire chemistry is more complex than one might expect. &quot;Some 30 or 40 chemicals go into tire rubber compounds, depending on the component—tread, sidewalls, belts, carcass plies and liner,&quot; notes James Rancourt, a consulting polymer scientist who heads <A href=""http://www.polymersolutions.com/litigation.html"">Polymer Solutions</A> in Blacksburg, Va. By weight, he explains, the tread compounds of a conventional tire contain about 28 percent natural rubber, which comes from latex sap, 28 percent synthetic rubber, which is made from oil, and 28 percent <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<mark>Carbon</mark>_black""><mark>carbon</mark> black filler</A>—a sootlike reinforcing agent that is produced by partially burning fossil fuels. The remaining 16 percent comprises different functional agents of various kinds.
The drive to produce low-rolling resistance tires was, in fact, a first step toward making them more ecofriendly because it involved replacing certain petroleum-based substances in tire construction, says Harold Herzlich, president of Las Vegas–based Herzlich Consulting, a former tire industry executive. Manufacturers added modified silica filler—essentially, surface-treated sand microparticles—to replace some of the <mark>carbon</mark> black reinforcement in standard tires. It lessens the frictional heat that the rubber compound creates as it flexes, stretches and recovers with each turn.
Japan's <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumitomo_Rubber_Industries""><mark>Sumitomo Rubber Industries</mark></A> introduced several years ago a Dunlop-branded tire line called Enasave 97 that incorporates natural ingredients. Sumitomo engineers not only used silica fillers, they also employed a specially modified natural rubber that grips better than unmodified versions, along with vegetable-derived processing oil, and cellulose-based (rayon) casing fibers, says company spokesperson, Masatoshi Hayashi. In 2008 it unveiled a prototype Enasave tire that contained 97 percent natural compounding ingredients and plans to market a model that will contain no petrochemical materials at all by 2013.<A href=""http://www.yokohamatire.com/"">Yokohama Tire</A> has in the meantime developed tires that are 80 percent petroleum-free, says Dan Guiney, director of technical services. The company's dB Super E-spec car tire and its ADVAN ENV-R1 racing tire both use modified natural rubber compounds and processing oil that is derived from orange peels, a waste by-product of fruit juice processing. The company, which introduced the dB Super E-spec orange oil-infused model last year, reportedly charges roughly 30 percent more for the green tire.
Michelin says that it employs sunflower oil in the rubber compound of its premium Primacy MXM4 all-weather tires to improve traction in winter conditions and shorten braking distances in the rain.
Other tire-makers are looking beyond traditional rubber trees to develop new, potentially cheaper and more <mark>sustainable</mark> crop sources of natural latex such as Russian dandelion, a central Asian weed variety, and guayule, a desert shrub that grows in the U.S. Southwest and Mexico, Herzlich says.
Still other companies are turning to renewable synthetic rubbers made of precursor chemicals that are grown in vats by biotech-modified microorganisms. In 2007 Goodyear entered into a research collaboration with the industrial biochemical firm Genencor of Palo Alto, Calif., (a subsidiary of Danisco, a Denmark-based food ingredient company) to develop microbes that can grow the isoprene monomer, or what the company calls <A href=""http://www.genencor.com/wps/wcm/connect/genencor/genencor/products_and_services/business_development/biochemicals/in_focus_bioisoprene/bioisoprene_en.htm"">BioIsoprene</A>, says Rich LaDuca, senior director of business development at Genencor. Goodyear will use the BioIsoprene to cook up a synthetic rubber that mimics natural rubber, which is composed of polymerized natural isoprene. The biotech firm will offer to supply the <mark>sustainable</mark> chemical to other tire manufacturers as well.
A research group at Oregon State University recently reported that microcellulose, or <A href=""http://www.iom3.org/news/wheeling-out-microcrystalline-cellulose"">microcrystalline cellulose</A>, which can be made from various plant fibers, provides a promising alternative to the heavy (and costly) silica mineral fillers now used to reduce tires' rolling resistance. The lightweight microcellulose could save even more fuel. More study is needed, however, to confirm the long-term durability of tires that incorporate this natural additive.
In the meantime, the tire industry is trying harder to recycle more of the estimated 300 million used tires that are discarded annually in the U.S. Tire recycling has grown markedly in recent years and small quantities of processed rubber are reused in some tires, but these efforts are limited by the quality of the rubber feedstock, Herzlich says. One company, Georgia-based <A href=""http://www.lehightechnologies.com/"">Lehigh Technologies</A>, has developed a process that freezes the rubber with liquid nitrogen before grinding it into pulverized rubber feedstock that could go into tires.
In time, the ongoing installation of new precision tire-making machinery that can hold much tighter manufacturing tolerances will allow tire-makers to produce tires that have little extra weight beyond the design spec, Herzlich says. &quot;If you take a half ounce out of a tire,&quot; he explains, &quot;it saves fuel because it makes it easier to rotate the wheel.&quot;
Although the overall environmental legacy of the car tire is still decidedly black, the appearance of fuel-saving designs, biosourced raw materials and more vigorous recycling programs have given its future a distinctly greener hue.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It is also a significant producer of golf and other sporting goods, and imports high-performance car tires from Europe and golf clubs from the United States.</P><P>The company is part of the Sumitomo group, one of Japan's largest <I>keiretsu</I>, or conglomerates. The Sumitomo group originated in a 17th-century book and medicine shop founded by Masatomo Sumitomo, a former samurai. Another Sumitomo family member perfected a method of extracting silver from crude copper by using lead, and by the late 17th century, the family ran a prominent copper mine and refinery. By the time of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, which initiated Japan's industrialization, Sumitomo's investment and development of copper mines made it one of Japan's largest companies.</P><P>The Sumitomo group owned an interest in Dunlop Japan, a unit of the British company Dunlop, when it was established in Kobe in 1909. Dunlop produced its first tires in Japan in 1913, and Sumitomo Rubber was established shortly thereafter, in 1917. A close relationship developed and continued between the two companies.</P><P>By the early 1940s, the Sumitomo group had matured into one of Japan's leading <I>zaibatsu</I>, huge industrial concerns tightly controlled by a central board. When Japan went to war against the United States in 1941, all Sumitomo enterprises were pressed into military production. By the end of World War II in 1945, Sumitomo's industrial facilities had been substantially damaged by air raids, but the company was slated for rehabilitation during the postwar occupation and restoration period.</P><P>All <I>zaibatsu</I> were disbanded at that time under antimonopoly laws, so each Sumitomo unit became an independent company. When antitrust legislation was eased in the early 1950s, Sumitomo associates began re-establishing former business ties. Like other former <I>zaibatsu</I>, Sumitomo gathered its former companies together again through its family-owned bank, which facilitated cross-ownership of shares between the companies. These looser, but still powerful, industrial groups were called <I>keiretsu</I>, with Sumitomo ranking third among them, after Mitsubishi and Mitsui.</P><P>Sumitomo Electric Industries, another member of the Sumitomo group, bought a majority share of Dunlop Japan in 1963, and changed Dunlop's name to <mark>Sumitomo Rubber Industries</mark> (SRI). The rubber concern remained one of Sumitomo's smaller ventures, selling mostly within Japan, and ranking 12th in the world market as of 1985. By 1987 however, SRI ranked sixth in the global tire market, with tire-manufacturing bases in Europe, the United States, and Japan, the world's three centers of automobile production. With a 6% share of the market, it was creeping up on fourth-place Firestone and fifth-place Uniroyal, while the pack was led by Goodyear with 20%, followed by Michelin with 17% and Japan's Bridgestone with 8%.</P><P>SRI's change in status came about through the company's acquisition of additional Dunlop operations. During the early 1980s, a growing number of Japanese companies realized that to compete in the world market, they must buy into foreign companies, thus obviating a static home economy and trade barriers abroad. SRI became a trendsetter when it purchased a 98% interest in Dunlop's tire production in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom for $240 million in 1984.</P><P>Dunlop was on the verge of bankruptcy when the friendly takeover was initiated. The British company had made a critical error in the early 1960s when it deemed steel-belted radial tires a passing fad. Instead of developing a steel-belted radial like pioneer Michelin, the company opted to produce cheaper textile radial tires. These wore longer than traditional crossply tires, but could not perform like steel-belted radials. By the 1970s, when it was clear that steel-belted radial had superseded conventional tires, Dunlop did not have the capital to initiate steel-belted radial production.</P><P>Another of Dunlop's miscues was its acquisition of an interest in the Italian tire maker Pirelli in 1971. Pirelli had significant losses that year, and Dunlop had to write off its ¥40 million investment in the Italian company. The highly inflationary period of 1974-1975 dealt a blow to Dunlop's borrowing power precisely when it should have been stepping up radial production. Although 1978 was one of its most profitable years ever, Dunlop's debt soon absorbed all its profits, and by 1983 the company was losing money. The company opted to reduce its product range, a mistake in the highly specialized tire market. Lack of cash meant that production facilities were in disrepair and design and development programs were canceled. Several factories were shut down as employees were cut from 5,000 to less than 3,500 in the United Kingdom. Morale was abysmal and even top executives quit. Finally in 1984, the British company found itself unable to refinance its French subsidiary's losses, and had to let it go into receivership.</P><P>SRI had maintained close technical and commercial links with Dunlop. Its investment in the operation was massive, so the Japanese company did not want Dunlop to fall into competitors' hands. Also, SRI saw that the Dunlop operations could be highly profitable if given the proper financial and managerial backing; so, at Dunlop's behest, it acquired most of the company's tire business in 1984. Dunlop's U.S. tire business was bought out by its management in 1984, but was acquired by SRI two years later.</P><P>SRI changed the U.K. company's name to SP Tyres, and the German one to SP Reifenwerke, but retained the Dunlop brand name. SRI officials predicted that the heavily loss-making U.K. operations would be profitable within three years. That appeared to be an audacious claim, but by 1986 SP Tyres achieved an operating profit, and by 1987 made after-tax profits, which increased the following year.</P><P>SRI renovated its newly acquired plants and cut the work force by about 20%. The company established a ten-point recovery plan focusing on communication, training, employee participation in company goal-setting, equality among workers, cleanliness, job security, capital expenditure, staff flexibility, improved production methods, and compensation. The Japanese company, believing that local people would know their plants better than the new parent company personnel, allowed each of its newly acquired factories to maintain its own management, with Japanese advisors standing by as consultants. A massive capital investment was directed at improving quality and production efficiency, and, by 1989, SP Tyres was making 40% more tires than before the acquisition with 30% fewer workers.</P><P><mark>Sumitomo Rubber Industries</mark> headed into the 1990s with growth in all three of its divisions--tires, sports equipment, and allied goods. Total sales climbed 14% in 1990, although a depressed market for automobile tires contributed to an 81% decrease in profits. The drop also reflected heavy capital investment in its overseas plants. SRI looked to new technologies and improved coordination of its operations. In December 1990, it incorporated Sumitomo Rubber Europe B.V. in the Netherlands to oversee its European operations and help prepare for the integration of the European market in 1992.</P><P><B>Principal Subsidiaries:</B> Sumitomo Rubber Europe B.V.(Netherlands); SP Tyres UK Ltd.; SPReifenwerke GmbH (Germany); Dunlop France S.A.; Dunlop Tire Corporation (U.S.A.).</P><H2>Additional Details</H2></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Goodyear could also help turn Dunlop, a big seller in Japan, into a powerhouse brand in North America and Europe.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""264"" data-total-count=""3181"">A lot of cost-cutting is also expected. The joint venture will likely close the oldest plants, executives said. And Goodyear and Sumitomo said they would realize as much as $360 million in savings from combining their purchases and eliminating duplicate functions.</P><DIV id=""story-ad-2"" class=""story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ""><DIV class=""accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden""><P>Advertisement</P></DIV><A class=""visually-hidden skip-to-text-link"" href=""#story-continues-4"">Continue reading the main story</A></DIV><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""239"" data-total-count=""3420"" id=""story-continues-4"">In Japan, Goodyear's role is smaller and more subtle. Sumitomo is the controlling partner there and is holding onto its own manufacturing plants, though Goodyear said they would eventually incorporate its advanced tire-making technologies.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""208"" data-total-count=""3628"">But the venture gives Goodyear inexpensive access to a market that it has previously had little luck penetrating. ''The only way to compete against Bridgestone in Japan is through Sumitomo,'' Mr. Gibara said.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""268"" data-total-count=""3896"">The full impact on Goodyear shareholders is still to be seen. The deal involves a combination of taxable and tax-free events around the world, and Goodyear's lawyers are ''working to see how to best minimize the tax implications for shareholders,'' a spokeswoman said.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""172"" data-total-count=""4068"">Also, Goodyear, which ended 1998 with about $2 billion in debt and a debt-to-equity ratio of about 30 percent, will have to borrow heavily to come up with the $936 million.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""171"" data-total-count=""4239"">Still, Goodyear's investors seemed pleased with the move. Shares of Goodyear, which is based in Akron, Ohio, rose $1.625, to $52, yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""178"" data-total-count=""4417"">Goodyear reported its fourth-quarter earnings yesterday; the posting of 78 cents a share met analyst expectations, when one-time gains of about 4 cents a share were factored out.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""205"" data-total-count=""4622"">Goodyear also said it would close an old plant in Gadsden, Ala., and that it would ''rationalize'' operations in Latin America and Asia.

Developing a close business relationship throughout the years, Sumitomo acquired Dunlop Japan in 1963, and renamed it <mark>Sumitomo Rubber Industries</mark> Ltd. Sumitomo Tire Manufacturer is still owned by Sumitomo Rubber Industry.  Sumitomo Tire Manufacturer develops a wide range of tires for performance, light truck, and medium truck vehicles.</P><P>The HTR Z III has just been introduced to the world. The HTR Z III offers Sumitomo’s signature engineering and vanguard technology. The design of the Z III combines euro performance with street tuner appeal, resulting in a tire with sterling traction, exquisite handling and a new level of ultimate performance tire. Key attributes to this tire are: four straight, wide grooves that heighten drainage for top-notch wet performance, and siped tie-bars, which reinforce block rigidity for enhanced traction.  A reinforced construction gives the HTR Z III additional toughness, ensuring real world durability and a Y-speed rating for capabilities on any high performance vehicle.</P><P>Another Performance Series tire from Sumitomo is the HTR Z II.  This tire is the ultimate for gripping wet surfaces giving this tire amazing handling on wet and dry roads.  Compounds composed of Ultra Micro <mark>Carbon</mark> Technology and Silica Based Rubber Engineering are added to increase wet and dry traction. A revolutionary tread pattern that has an aggressive directional tread pattern is combine with a bold, wide tread-aggressive appearance gives the tire outstanding grip. A key advantage of this tire is the deep circumferential center rain grooves, which give the tire phenomenal hydroplaning resistance. Multi-directional water channels improve wet traction, while increasing handling grip, performance, and steering response while traveling in wet conditions. The HTR Z II is an extremely long lasting tire that includes PSP technology, which improves durability throughout the life of the tire. In addition to the features that protect the tire, a wheel flange guard that protects the wheel rim from damage from potholes and curbs.</P><P>Sumitomo’s most popular light truck tire is the HTR Sport H/P. A non-directional all season tread in incorporated with a center rib for straight-line stability. Added to the design for maximum grip and long lasting tread wear, was the shoulder block. Four wide deep circumferential grooves were contributed to the design to give the tire champion anti-hydroplaning capabilities and a segmented mold for quality uniformity for a smooth ride on even the worst surfaces.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

Introduction</H2><DIV class=""html-p"">Biopolymers are widely distributed and exhibit specific vital functions in nature [<A href=""#B1-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">1</A>,<A href=""#B2-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">2</A>]. Chitin and natural rubber (NR, <SPAN class=""html-italic"">cis</SPAN>-1,4-polyisoprene) are representative biopolymers with highly crystalline and amorphous natures, respectively [<A href=""#B3-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">3</A>,<A href=""#B4-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">4</A>,<A href=""#B5-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">5</A>,<A href=""#B6-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">6</A>]. Chitin is an aminopolysaccharide composed of β(1→4)-linked <SPAN class=""html-italic"">N</SPAN>-acetyl-<SPAN class=""html-small-caps"">d</SPAN>-glucosamine repeating units and is present in the exoskeletons of crustaceans, shellfish, and insects. It still remains an unutilized biomass resource, primarily because of its intractable bulk structure and insolubility in water and common organic solvents. Therefore, research concerning the conversion of chitin to various useful bio-based materials after proper dissolution in suitable solvents has attracted much attention in recent years [<A href=""#B7-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">7</A>]. Some ionic liquids such as imidazolium acetates with different substituents were found to dissolve chitin [<A href=""#B8-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">8</A>,<A href=""#B9-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">9</A>,<A href=""#B10-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">10</A>]. We also reported that an ionic liquid, 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (AMIMBr), dissolves chitin in concentrations up to 4.8 weight percent (wt%) and further forms ion gels with higher contents of chitin [<A href=""#B11-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">11</A>,<A href=""#B12-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">12</A>]. We found in a subsequent publication that chitin self-assembles to form nanofiber dispersions by regeneration from the ion gel using methanol (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f001"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 1</A>a). When the dispersion was filtered, the isolated self-assembled chitin nanofibers (CNFs) got highly entangled resulting in the formation of a film [<A href=""#B13-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">13</A>,<A href=""#B14-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">14</A>,<A href=""#B15-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">15</A>]. The dispersion has been used with other polymeric components such as cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, and poly(vinyl alcohol) to obtain CNF-containing composite materials [<A href=""#B13-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">13</A>,<A href=""#B16-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">16</A>,<A href=""#B17-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">17</A>]. As nanofibrillation is one of the efficient approaches for the functionalization of chitin, CNFs prepared by various techniques have been employed to fabricate composite materials besides those in the above studies [<A href=""#B7-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">7</A>,<A href=""#B13-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">13</A>,<A href=""#B14-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">14</A>,<A href=""#B18-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">18</A>,<A href=""#B19-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">19</A>,<A href=""#B20-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">20</A>,<A href=""#B21-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">21</A>].</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">For example, CNFs prepared by acid-hydrolysis were used as reinforcing agents for NR [<A href=""#B22-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">22</A>,<A href=""#B23-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">23</A>,<A href=""#B24-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">24</A>]. NR is obtained from plants as NR latex, in which <SPAN class=""html-italic"">cis</SPAN>-1,4-polyisoprene particles are dispersed in an aqueous continuous phase. NR forms a stable colloid in basic aqueous solutions, such as ammonia solution, because the particle surface is negatively charged [<A href=""#B25-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">25</A>]. NR is one of the most important elastomers used in industry and it has been found that the properties of NR can be tailored by the addition of fillers of varying aggregate size and aspect ratio [<A href=""#B26-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">26</A>]. For additional functionalization of NR, porous films were fabricated loaded with gentamicin sulfate for wound dressings [<A href=""#B27-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">27</A>].</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">Based on the finding that the aforementioned self-assembled CNFs are redispersed in aqueous media under weakly basic conditions, such as in ammonia aqueous solution (aq.) (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f001"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 1</A>b), in this study we investigated the preparation of CNF-NR composite sheets via mixing the CNF-ammonia (aq.) dispersion with NR latex stabilized with ammonia, followed by drying (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f002"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 2</A>a). Further, composite porous materials were also fabricated through the formation of CNF-NR aggregates by the evaporation of ammonia stabilizer from the mixture (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f002"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 2</A>b).</DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""sec2-biomolecules-07-00047"" type=""results""><H2 data-nested=""1"">  2.

Preparation of Self-Assembled CNF-NR Composite Sheets</H4><DIV class=""html-p"">As previously reported [<A href=""#B13-biomolecules-07-00047"" class=""html-bibr"">13</A>], the self-assembled CNF dispersion with methanol was prepared via gelation with AMIMBr followed by regeneration using methanol. The dispersion was then filtered to isolate CNFs and produce the self-assembled CNF film (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f001"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 1</A>a). When the film was immersed in 1 mol/L ammonia (aq.) for 24 h at room temperature with stirring followed by sonication for 1 h, the film was disentangled and the CNFs were gradually dispersed, probably owing to weakening hydrogen bonds under such weakly basic conditions (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f001"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 1</A>b). The dispersed state was stable after standing for 24 h, indicating good redispersion of CNFs in ammonia (aq.). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the resulting dispersion (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f003"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 3</A>c) shows the relatively independent nanofiber morphology, which is different from that of the CNF film (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f003"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 3</A>b). Although the aggregated morphology of CNFs after redispersion is also seen (compared with the SEM image of the original dispersion obtained by regeneration from the ion gel using methanol (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f003"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 3</A>a)), the SEM result suggests the redispersible property of CNFs in ammonia (aq.).</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">The redispersion of CNFs with ammonia (aq.) was mixed with NR latex (60 wt%) to fabricate CNF-NR composite materials at different CNF weight ratios (CNF:NR = 0.01, 0.02, 0.1, 0.2:1), because latex is stabilized with ammonia (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f002"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 2</A>a). After the mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature, it was sonicated for 1 h to give a dispersion of NR with CNF. The dispersion was dried under reduced pressure for 4 h at 60 °C in a drying tray to obtain a CNF-NR composite sheet. SEM images of the resulting sheets with different weight ratios show the relatively independent nanofiber morphologies in areas of NR solids (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f004"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 4</A>). These results suggest that CNFs were dispersed well in the NR latex. Further, with the increasing weight ratio of CNFs, the nanofiber morphologies are more clearly seen in the SEM images of the composite sheets. X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of the composite sheets with lower CNF weight ratios (CNF:NR = 0.01, 0.02:1) did not show obvious crystalline peaks, similar to that of a pure NR sheet (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f005"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 5</A>a–c) that was prepared by drying NR latex. With increasing weight ratios of CNFs (CNF:NR = 0.1, 0.2:1), the diffraction peaks assigned to the crystal structure of chitin were gradually detected (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f005"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 5</A>d–f). These results indicate the retention of the crystal structure of chitin in the composite. The mechanical properties of the composite sheets were evaluated by tensile testing. The resulting stress–strain curves exhibited that with increasing weight ratio of CNF, the tensile strength and Young’s modulus increased, whereas the elongation values at break decreased (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f006"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 6</A> and <A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-t001"" class=""html-table"">Table 1</A>). Particularly, these values for the compositions with higher weight ratios of CNFs (CNF:NR = 0.1, 0.2:1), were significantly different from those of a pure NR sheet. These results support the effects of strengthening of mechanical properties and the reinforcement with increasing weight ratio of CNFs.</DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""sec2dot2-biomolecules-07-00047"" type=""""><H4 class=""html-italic"" data-nested=""2"">  2.2. Preparation of Self-Assembled CNF-NR Composite Porous Materials</H4><DIV class=""html-p"">The CNF-NR porous materials were fabricated by different preparation procedures from those above (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f002"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 2</A>b). The CNF-NR dispersions with different weight ratios (CNF:NR = 0.01, 0.02, 0.1, 0.2:1), which were prepared by the same procedure as above (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f002"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 2</A>a), were heated for 24 h at 60 °C with stirring to evaporate the ammonia stabilizer. The resulting mixtures were then lyophilized to prepare the composite materials. The XRD profiles of the composites show similar results to those of the above composite sheets in which the diffraction peaks assigned to the crystal structure of chitin gradually increased with increasing weight ratio of CNF (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f007"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 7</A>). The SEM image of the composite with lower CNF weight ratio (CNF:NR = 0.01:1) shows a morphology with a few small pores (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f008"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 8</A>b), which is different from that of a pure NR sheet (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f008"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 8</A>a). With increasing weight ratio of CNF (CNF:NR = 0.02, 0.1:1), the SEM images showed increases in the number and size of pores, indicating the formation of porous materials (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f008"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 8</A>c,d). With further increasing weight ratio of CNF (CNF:NR = 0.2:1), however, obvious frameworks for the porous morphology were not seen in the SEM image (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f008"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 8</A>e). Indeed, the material showed a brittle nature.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">To evaluate the mechanism for the formation of the porous structure, a charge coupled device (CCD) camera view of the CNF-NR mixtures after the evaporation of ammonia was recorded (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f009"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 9</A>). CCD images show the formation of larger aggregates with an increasing weight ratio of CNF, whereas such aggregates are not seen in the image of the NR latex. SEM images of the same samples also observed the aggregate morphologies (<A href=""#biomolecules-07-00047-f010"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 10</A>). These results suggest that CNFs aggregate with NR in the absence of ammonia stabilizer. Lyophilization of the mixtures caused agglomeration of the aggregates with the formation of spaces between them to construct the porous structure. The presence of larger amounts of CNFs provided larger aggregates, resulting in the increased number and size of pores, leading to unclear frameworks with large spaces.</DIV></SECTION></SECTION><SECTION id=""sec3-biomolecules-07-00047"" type=""""><H2 data-nested=""1"">  3.

Conclusions</H2><DIV class=""html-p"">In this paper, we reported the preparation of self-assembled CNF-NR composite sheets and porous materials. The self-assembled CNFs were redispersed by mixing the CNF film with ammonia (aq.) Accordingly, the CNF dispersion with ammonia (aq.) was mixed with NR latex stabilized with ammonia, followed by drying under reduced pressure to obtain CNF-NR composite sheets. SEM and XRD measurements were performed to evaluate the composition and crystal structure in the sheets, respectively. The tensile testing of the sheets confirmed the reinforcing effect of CNFs in the sheets. When the CNF-NR dispersion was heated to evaporate ammonia, porous materials were fabricated following lyophilization. By evaporating ammonia stabilizer, CNFs were aggregated with NR. The aggregates were then agglomerated, forming spaces between them to construct the porous structure.</DIV></SECTION></DIV><DIV class=""html-back""><SECTION id=""html-ack"" class=""html-ack""><H2>Acknowledgments</H2><DIV class=""html-p"">NR latex (Selatex 1100) was kindly supplied by <mark>Sumitomo Rubber Industries</mark>, Ltd., Kobe, Hyogo, Japan. </DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""html-notes"" class=""html-notes""><H2>Author Contributions</H2><DIV class=""html-p"">Kazuya Yamamoto and Jun-ichi Kadokawa conceived the project, designed the experiments, directed the research, and wrote the manuscript.

Large agricultural areas will thus be available to food production again.</P><P>Aspects such as sustainability, <mark>climate change</mark> and ecology are key factors that will make industrial biotechnology increasingly important in these areas.</P><P>The <STRONG>third goal</STRONG> of industrial biotechnology is the production of so-called „impossible molecules“, which cannot be produced by petrochemical processes.</P><P>Industrial biotechnology is understood to mean the industrial production of products by means of fermentation using genetically optimized microorganisms.</P><P>The baker‘s yeast „saccharomyces cerevisiae“ plays an important role in industrial fermentation processes. Baker‘s yeast is the first higher genome that was fully decoded in 1996 and contains 6000 genes. The genome database of baker‘s yeast is one of the most comprehensive and probably the best documented.</P><P>In the ancient fermentation process with yeast for beer production, sugar is decomposed to alcohol and <mark>carbon</mark>ic acid. The process takes place via a plurality of intermediate steps and molecules. If the yeast gene is changed, the process is interrupted and an intermediate is formed. The applied genetic engineering determines the extent of the changes and it is possible to initiate completely new biochemical processes and thus create new molecules. The nature and yield of these molecules is controlled by genetic engineering.</P><P>The question now arises as to which factors are decisive, and that industrial biology is becoming a more and more important focus and is called <STRONG>key technology</STRONG>.</P><P>On the one hand, there is the <STRONG>artificial intelligence (<A href=""https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AI"" title=""Arlington Asset Investment Corporation"">AI</A>)</STRONG>, which allows completely new processes by processing enormous data and machine learning. Automation in the laboratory, both in design, production and analysis, also plays a very important role.</P><P>Therefore, the most important factor is the progress in gene editing. An important factor is also the range of products made possible by industrial biotechnology. In the chemical industry based on the petrochemical industry  the starting point of the compounds on which other molecules can build up is very small. Biology offers a much wider range. 60% of the naturally occurring chemical substances are terpenoids. With genetically modified yeasts, many of these terpenoids can be produced. Besides Terpenoids, 9 different molecule families can be produced until today.</P><P>But what about safety? The genetic engineering applied should not be confused with the controversial gene manipulation since no genetically manipulated molecules are released. The genedited yeast is only a process aid and no genetically manipulated fragments can be detected in the desired end product. Centuries of experience in brewing and baking processes have shown that the use of yeast is safe, and no negative incidents have been documented in all these years. The advantage of using baker‘s yeast in the fermentation process is that it is easy to grow in the laboratory as well as in the industrial bioreactor and the results are identical.</P><P>A major advantage of industrial biotechnology compared to the chemical industry is that only a single reactor and process is necessary for the different molecules and only a fraction of the infrastructure investment is required compared to the chemical industry.</P><P>The key factor for individual companies in industrial biotechnology will be to make and reduce the <STRONG>DBTL cycle</STRONG> „design production test learning“(see DBTL cycle below).</P><P>The cooperation between different disciplines such as biotechnology, molecular biology, biophysics, genetic editing, AI, metabolism and fermentation engineering plays an important role and is therefore very complex.</P><P>The first product of industrial biotechnology was „Artemisinin“, a drug against malaria, which was developed with the support of the „Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation“ in the year 2004.</P><P>Amyris has optimized the process in which Artemisinin is produced of sugar cane with the help of genetically modified bakery yeast. The product was developed on a non-profit basis and the drug was produced from 2013 by Sanofi in Italy.</P><P>Even in the 1990s, vitamin B2 was produced by a chemical process in an eight-stage synthesis process. With today‘s single-stage fermentation process, 40% of the costs, 60% of the raw materials, 30% of <mark>CO2</mark> emissions and 95% of waste can be saved or avoided.</P><P>The first products of industrial biotechnology were still developed manually in the laboratory and also the analyses and evaluations were carried out manually or with software which was only applicable for individual steps of the manufacturing process. The next phase of a project could only be tackled when the results of the last analyses and assessments were made. The research was linear and empirical and the time and cost was correspondingly high. The development of „Artemisinin“ lasted 4 years and the effort is estimated at over 150 manyear.</P><P>If you consider that at the bakery yeast for editing 6000 genes is available, and each building block has to decide for one of the following possibilities (deleting, replacing, concatenating, inserting before and inserting afterwards), then everybody can imagine that empirical methods were timeconsuming and exhausting. </P><P>In R&amp;D in industrial biotechnology, a paradigm shift has taken place, away from an empirical to systematic application-related research and Amyris has become a front leader with the most compendiously DBTL-cycle.</P><P>At Amyris, the building blocks of this DBTL cycle (design-build-test-learn) are presented today as follows:</P><P>In order to be able to produce a desired molecule from yeast, the DNA is designed on the computer. The individual building blocks are selected from a database in which the possible effects of this building block are listed. At the end of the fermentation process in the laboratory robot, the structure and the yield of the molecule are determined by means of automated spectroscopy and the supercomputer makes suggestions for the next design if the structure of the molecule has not yet been reached or The yield is too low.</P><P><STRONG>Design</STRONG></P><P>Amyris has a database where practically every single gene of baker‘s yeast is collected and continuously flows into the results of the research that captures the properties and effects of the DNS.</P><P>Not only the results of thousands of parallel experiments are recorded, but also the results and publications from all over the world are captured and included with artificial intelligence. The super computer Lila which is behind it, can explore complex new routes with „machine learning“ and capture and document correlations between the DNS.</P><P>The genes are no more put together in the laboratory, but first on the computer with Thumper, a compilation software that allows you to select the building blocks according to the properties stored in the database. The AI software can submit proposals that refer to the results of previous experiments.</P><P><STRONG>Build</STRONG></P><P>An important standard of genetic engineering today is the CRISPR/CAS9 technology, which enables a faster exchange of a single segment. Amyris has further developed and patented this technology and can use this Hi-RYSE ™ (Hyper integration for rapid Yeast strain) technology to introduce up to 24-48 DNA parts simultaneously at different locations (Low level nucleotic editing), or not just single genes but insert whole sequences in one place.</P><P>The laboratory works are carried out with fully automated strain Engineering (ASE) robots, with an improvement of a factor of 25 being achieved.</P><P><STRONG>Test</STRONG></P><P>The HTP-MS (High Throughput Screening) system, which accelerates the analyzes by a factor of 20, is automatically detected by the spectroscopy analysis. The data flows directly into the databases and can be evaluated by LISA.</P><P><STRONG>Learn</STRONG></P><P>Here too, LISA is used with its machine learning functions. It is therefore from the thousands of attempts to select the yeast strain, which indicates the best yield of the product, while at the same time considering possible influences from existing experiments. Example: A high yield is useless if a byproduct develops toxic properties at the same time, and the development of the main product is disturbing.</P><P>The fermentation process must be scalable from the lab scale of a few milliliters to an industrial scale of 200,000 liters per tank.</P><P>With the described DBTL cycle, Amyris was able to reduce the development time for products by a factor of four.</P><P>Today, 120,000 yeast strains are produced and analyzed by Amyris every month. The processing of a cycle with 6 parallel gene transformations takes only 3 weeks.</P><P>The aim of the research is also to improve existing processes. In 2017, Amyris was able to adjust the metabolic process of the yeast used in the production of ß-farneses, resulting in 25% more yield and 75% lower oxygen demand.</P><P>Amyris is one of the only companies in industrial biotechnology that has a vertical structure with its own production facility in Brazil, placed next to a sugar cane factory to produce sustainably and flexibly.</P><P>In other sectors of industry, which are in a mature state, they have long since got over to a horizontal structure. In the start-up phase, however, many of these companies were also vertically positioned. Industrial biotechnology is just ahead of the breakthrough, and the complex processes of the DBLT cycle require close collaboration that benefits from a vertical structure in this initial phase of the industry. Subprojects and tasks can nevertheless be outsourced to specialists.</P><P>After the success with artemisinin, Amyris has turned to the field of biofuels, with the goal of producing <mark>sustainable</mark> fuels from sugar cane. However, the production costs could never be reduced to the market price of kerosene.</P><P>In 2012, Amyris changed its strategy and concentrated on the development of complex molecules of higher values. The experience from the production of artemisinin and ß-farnesen can now be implemented by Amyris to optimize the DBTL cycle and to produce molecules with short development times and thus low costs. The high degree of automation, the networking and the vertical structure pay off here and Amyris can offer attractive conditions for the development of different molecules to customers. Statement by John Melo, CEO of Amyris: „<STRONG>We want to be the low cost leader in Synthetic Biology.“</STRONG></P><P>With a number of partner companies and authorities, Amyris has entered into agreements and contracts with key strategic objectives.</P><P><STRONG>Royal DSM</STRONG>, partner of Amyris since 2017, has transformed an incredible transformation from a chemical company for petrochemicals and basic chemicals to a company of hightech materials (performance materials) and nutritional supplements (nutrition) in recent years. In 2017, DSM has invested $ 70 million in Amyris and holds now a 36% stake in the company.</P><P>DSM has in the course of this collaboration completed three contracts on the production of two unspecified nutrient molecule and an additive for vitamin A in 2017.</P><P><STRONG>DARPA</STRONG> is the research department of the US Department of Defense and was the initiator of a whole series of groundbreaking inventions. From Kevlar to the GPS system, the first weather satellite to Arpanet, a predecessor to the Internet, the range of projects launched by DARPA is enourmous.</P><P>As early as 2013, DAPRA launched the „Living Foundries“ project in the domain of biology, which was initially aimed improving the robustness of processes in synthetic biology. In 2015, DARPA expanded the „Living Foundries“ program. The goal is to produce 1000 new molecules from biological raw materials using industrial biotechnology. The first phase ends in mid-2018, which had the goal of finding new procedures for existing molecules. In the second phase, which is scheduled to continue until the middle of 2019, it is planned to produce so-called „impossible molecules“ (see above). In the third phase, the objective is to produce unnatural polymers, new nanomaterials and new products based on new catalysts.</P><P>With Amyris, Darpa has signed a $ 35 million contract for the first phase in 2015.</P><P>According to a communication from DARPA, a third of the new molecules are already produced in September 2017, of which over 200 are molecules from Amyris.</P><P>With <STRONG>BIOGEN</STRONG>, Amyris ventures into the pharmaceuticals sector. Monoclonal antibodies are traditionally produced by means of cultivated mammalian cells in large bioreactors. The CHO - Cell line abbreviated by &quot;Chinese Hamster Ovary&quot; is one of the most commonly used cell lines in the biotechnological production of active ingredients. However, such cultures develop slowly, require complex media, are sensitive to viral infections and often result in only a low yield. The safety requirements when working with such bioreactors are very high and incur a correspondingly high cost. The separation of the desired antibody is very laborious, in fact often 10 different forms are produced simultaneously.</P><P>Biogen has in cooperation with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) tried in vain to substantially improve the existing processes. In collaboration with the „Bill and Melinda Gates“ Foundation, Biogen in 2016 has launched a project to test 8 different plant cell culture systems instead of the CHO cell line.</P><P>For Biogen Amyris with its &quot;yPharm&quot; platform has to clarify whether the way over yeast is a viable way. Yeast as a cell culture would be much easier to handle, viral infections would be excluded and antibodies could be made very specific (= only one antibody and no elaborate separation). At the same time, you could both produce with such a Amyris platform and investigate new antibodies, which is not possible with CHO cell lines. First results can be expected by March 2018 at the latest and a success would have a major impact on this important area in biotechnology.</P><P>Amyris also has a number of additional partners with projects in a wide range of markets (Total, Cofco, Givaudan, Firmenich, Janssen, Michelin, Takasago) which are addressed later.</P><P><STRONG>John Doerr „The next Big Thing“</STRONG></P><P>This is a statement from a person involved in Amyris, who stands out with a glorious background. John Doerr is one of the most successful investors in America. He is a partner of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and has participated spectacularly in many start-ups. He was one of the first investors on Google and Amazon. With his start-up investion of $ 8M dollars he was involved in 13% at Amazon. 13% of Amazon are today however 60 Billion worth.</P><P>John Doerr is on the Board of Directors of Google and Amyris today. Over the years, he has invested several times in Amyris and now holds about 25% share.</P><P>John Doerr is very keen to promote the green industries and his original goal was to support the development of biofuels at Amyris. The fact that he recently invested millions of dollars in Amyris again shows that he also supports the new strategy of the CEO John Melo and wants to contribute, as he says, to build a <STRONG>„Living Chemical Factory“</STRONG>.</P><P>It is astonishing how wide the range of products that Amyris can ferment from cane sugar be spread. The Amyris divisions are correspondingly broad:</P><P>Products:</P><P><STRONG>Health &amp; Nutrition:</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Pharma:</STRONG></P><P>Research targets with Biogen, see above, plus an agreement with Janssen Biotech, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, to develop a library of biosynthetic materials to compare these with existing Janssen Biotech targets. There is also a collaboration or agreement with Roche. However, details are not known.</P><P>Terpenoids show a wide range of biological activities and are already used as medicines (artemisinin, taxol). Terpenoids are often difficult to produce via chemical processes. The industrial biotechnology with the genetically modified metabolic pathways can show new ways to produce known or derived terpenoids. In the future, more and more pharmaceutical products based on terpenoids will be introduced, which will play a more important role in the pharmaceutical market.</P><P><STRONG>Nutrition:</STRONG></P><P>Since DSM invested in Amyris, the new partner has already signed three contracts for the development and production of three molecules in the areas of functional food and nutritional supplements. Two of the molecules are completely unknown, and the third is an addition to vitamin A. DSM is also the new partner in the area of vitamin E, Amyris has dissolved the previous contracts with Nenter in favor of the new partner DSM.</P><P>An interesting area to which Amyris and also DSM are focused is the area of artificial sweeteners. Amyris has announced that they are working on the development of three different sweeteners. A first production batch is to be delivered by the end of 2017 to a sweet beverage producer. See below for more details.</P><P><STRONG>Personal Care:</STRONG></P><P>Among the fragrances, Amyris has already developed some products derived from ß-farneses.</P><UL><LI>Firmenich <STRONG>CLEARWOOD™</STRONG> (Tom Ford PATCHOULI ABSOLU, <mark>Innovation</mark> Prize Sepawa 2015)</LI><LI>Firmenich <STRONG>AMBROX R SUPER™</STRONG> (Calvin Klein Obsessed, Gucci Guilty absolute)</LI></UL><P>For the partner companies Givaudan, Firmenich, IFF and Taksago, Amyris wants to develop further products on the same or similar basis.</P><P><STRONG>Cosmetics</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Skin care</STRONG></P><P>In the skin care sector, squalane is the most important product produced from ß-farneses. Squalane is a naturally occurring product and is used as a smoothing and moisturizing lipid component, originally derived from the liver of sharks or olive oil. The third generation of Squalane is now derived from sugarcane and is produced in high purity by Amyris.</P><P>Squalane is the only product of Amyris which is marketed by Amyris under the <STRONG>Biossance™ </STRONG> brand in the USA and Canada directly through the Sephora shops. Direct selling justifies Amyris with the very good acceptance and evaluation of this long known substance and the high margin which is possible due to the new manufacturing process.</P><P>Cosmetics active components:</P><P>In the field of cosmetically active components, Amyris and its partners from F &amp; F and DSM want to develop and market other important molecules under the label „Amyris inside“.</P><P>Amyris notes that today, 500 brands of cosmetics are already included in Amyris‘ products.</P><P><STRONG>Processing industry</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Lubricants:</STRONG></P><P>Over the last few months, Amyris has been partnering with a number of new and <mark>sustainable</mark> products.</P><P><STRONG>Novvi™ </STRONG> is a joint venture of Amyris, Cosan, Chevron, the American Refining Group and H&amp;R to develop 100% <mark>sustainable</mark> lubricants. These lubricants often show better technical values than petroleum-based lubricants.</P><P><STRONG>Polymers:</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Krasol F3000™ </STRONG> is a <mark>sustainable</mark> plastic produced by Total Cray Valley, a subsidiary of Total from ß-Farnesene in the Czech Republic, and suitable for new markets such as sprayable coatings in the automotive and electronics industries.</P><P><STRONG>LFR™ </STRONG> (liquid ß-Farnesene rubber) is the first product of Kuraray from Japan, which has concluded a multi-year development cooperation with Amyris. LFR shows a much deeper viscosity versus petroleum based products, and increases the life and grip of car tires. At the beginning of 2017, <mark>Sumitomo Rubber Industries</mark> launched the first winter tire under the brand name DUNLOP WINTER Maxx 02, which exploits these advantages.</P><P>In September, Kuraray launched its first series of <mark>sustainable</mark> plastics (bioplastics) based on ß-Farnesene under the brand name <STRONG>SEPTON ™ BIO</STRONG>.</P><P><STRONG>Isoprenes:</STRONG></P><P>In collaboration with Michelin and Braskem, Amyris is working on the development of a <mark>sustainable</mark> isoprene for the production of car tires.</P><P>-----</P><P><STRONG>Future and competition</STRONG></P><P>What does industrial biotechnology expect in the future?</P><P>In the fields of industrial biotechnology and synthetic biology, there are many companies with promising approaches, but few with industrial scale products.</P><P>Evolva, Ginko Bioworks and Zymergen work in a similar environment as Amyris, but they are not part of <STRONG>industrial biotechnology</STRONG> for the simple reason that they do not (yet) have industrial fermentation facilities.</P><P>These companies develop the yeast strains in the laboratory scale and leave it to their partners or clients to scale and produce in an industrial scale.</P><P>Combating <mark>climate change</mark> and <mark>sustainable</mark> development is one of the most important objectives and we have to tackle this on all fronts. Industrial biotechnology can help conserve resources, produce chemicals and products more easily and more sustainably, and make better use of agricultural land.</P><P>The goal of industrial biotechnology will be to optimize and shorten the DBTL cycle, thereby enabling the development of thousands of molecules.</P><P>Hitherto, baker‘s yeast „saccharomyces cerevisiae“ is mostly used in the fermentation processes because their genome is completely decoded. However, 700 yeast species are known and soon further yeast species will be decoded. Industrial biotechnology still has a very wide field of activity here.</P><P>Another interesting development is the production of products in a cell-free environment. The fermentation process with living organisms is thereby replaced by a development process in which only the necessary constituents from the cells are used. </P><P>Important for the future of industrial biotechnology will be the assessment in comparison with existing industries, which is to replace industrial biotechnology.</P><P>The extent to which synthetic biology replaces fossil processes depends on the market price of the molecules, which could be substituted. Where is the profit threshold for the conversion to biologically produced chemicals? All chemical products with a market value of $ 2 to $ 2.5 will be produced over these <mark>sustainable</mark> processes sooner or later.</P><P>Industrial biotechnology is now considered part of the third industrial revolution and is one of the emerging technologies in the Global Risk Report 2017 of the WEF. Synthetic biology is, however, in conflict with the same <mark>sustainable</mark> resources that are also in demand for nutrition and energy demand.</P><P><STRONG>Key market for Amyris - Sweeteners</STRONG></P><P>One of the key markets in the near future is the field of artificial sweeteners, which is subject to a strong competition of actors with different objectives. The beverage industry and the food industry in general are facing the demands of consumers and authorities to reduce sugar levels in food.</P><P>An important artificial sweetener is Stevia, originally from the plant „Stevia rebaudian“ native to South America.</P><P>The stevia is not particularly popular among consumers because of the metallic and bitter aftertaste. The high effort for the small portions of the sweetener which have to be extracted from the plants are, from an ecological point of view, questionable and controversial.</P><P>The stevia, which is on the market today, contains stevioside and rebaudioside A „(Reb-A) with the mentioned taste disadvantages. Since 2015, Coca-Cola Life has been on the market with a stevia proportion.</P><P>The industry wants to bridge the cap of negative taste with special variants from the Stevia plant.</P><P>The original plant contains a mixture of up to 12 different steviolglycosides. „Rebaudioside D“ (Reb-D) and „Rebaudiosid M“ (Reb-M) are the two molecules which are characterized by a high sweetness as well as a neutral taste. The only problem is that their concentration in the plant is in the low percent range. The extraction process is even more complex and the required cultivation area and the use of pesticides is even greater.</P><P>In addition to Amyris, there are a number of other companies (Evolva, Manu Biotech) who are looking for a simpler way to produce Reb-M. Since Reb-M is also a terpenoid, it can also be produced via fermentation processes using genedited yeast. The purity of the molecules thus produced is very high and critical byproducts are excluded.</P><P>There are a number of patents for this path through „methabolic engineering“. Evolva has such a patent and wants to bring the sweetener together with Cargill under the name „EverSweet“ on the market. Evolva wants to put $ 60 million into a cooperation agreement, with Cargill standing for the production of „EverSweet“ in Nebraska. At the beginning of 2017, Evolva anticipated construction periods of three years, but at the same time announced the introduction of „EverSweet“ on 2018. How fast the scaling and adaptation of the production, which up to now only has been successfull in a laboratory scale, to an industrial production plant will be shown.</P><P>Amyris has an industrial fermentation plant in Brazil with 6 fermenters of 200‘000 liters each, and has optimized the fermentation processes for many years and proved the scaling of different yeast strains. As already mentioned, Amyris plans to launch the first sweetener on the market with partners in 2018 and two further variants by 2019.</P><P><STRONG>Stunning Outlook for Amyris</STRONG></P><P>The strong shortening of the DBTL cycle will allow for the rapid and cost-efficient release of molecules into the market in the future.</P><P>Amyris will enter the profit threshold in 2018 and start a new area in industrial biotechnology.</P><P>This development is based on the special <STRONG>business model of Amyris</STRONG>.</P><P>The development of the products by Amyris occurs only with marginally costing to its partners, but Amyris has always negotiated a percentage profit participation in the case of commercial success. The first products are now on the market and starting from 2018 Amyris can reap the fruits of this strategy.</P><DIV class=""full_disclosure""><P><STRONG>Disclosure:</STRONG> I am/we are long AMRS.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><ASIDE class=""article-bottom-wrapper""><DIV class=""t_to_p hidden hidden-print"" id=""add-ticker-to-portfolio-unit""><DIV class=""t_add_to_p"">Follow Huggenberg and get email alerts</DIV></DIV></ASIDE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

					&lt;p&gt;This story was originally published by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting, a nonprofit news organization based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Learn more at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/&quot;&gt;revealnews.org&lt;/a&gt; and subscribe to the Reveal podcast, produced with PRX, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/podcast&quot;&gt;revealnews.org/podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven Morris and his wife, Patricia, were headed to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to celebrate their 26th wedding anniversary when the back tire on their Harley-Davidson motorcycle failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patricia, seated at the rear, was thrown from the bike and later died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All of a sudden, the tire just let go; there was no warning, no nothing,” said Steven Morris, 59, an experienced motorcycle rider who co-owns a car and motorcycle repair shop in Cape Coral, Florida. “It all happened so fast. It took my life away from me. She was my life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2008 blowout, which involved a Dunlop D402 tire made by Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., prompted Steven, who was driving, to lose control of the motorcycle, Georgia&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4363958-MVA-Report-Morris-5-13-08-Copy.html#document/p2/a401615&quot;&gt; police reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 Steven Morris, posing with his Harley-Davidson motorcycle in Cape Coral, Fla., was injured and his wife, Patricia, was killed in 2008 when the rear Dunlop D402 tire made by Goodyear on the bike blew out, prompting him to lose control. Since 2006, there have been five deaths and 22 injuries in 11 states after D402 tire blowouts.Credit: Eve Edelheit for Reveal
&lt;p&gt;Besides Patricia Morris, at least four other people have died and 22 have been injured since 2006 after D402 motorcycle tires on Harleys failed in 11 states, according to a review by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting of state and federal court filings and police reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all these cases have sparked lawsuits against Goodyear. The company prevailed in two cases and reached settlements in eight others. Three more lawsuits are pending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation’s top auto safety regulator should act, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Absolutely, five deaths and 22 injuries from the same tire on motorcycles made for Harley-Davidson is a significant number and warrants an immediate investigation by NHTSA,” said Joan Claybrook, a former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the federal agency that sets safety regulations for motor vehicles and equipment, including tires, and can request that manufacturers recall vehicles and tires with safety defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented with Reveal’s findings, Goodyear insisted the tires are safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We take all incidents involving our products very seriously,” Laura Duda, a Goodyear spokeswoman, wrote in an email. “Every incident is unique, and each claim is thoroughly examined and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the case of Dunlop D402 motorcycle tires, there are no defects related to motor vehicle safety,” she added. “In fact, most motorcycle tire issues are the result of underinflation, overloading or damage from road hazards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duda said Goodyear reports all death and injury claims to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. There is no set number of complaints the agency must receive before opening an investigation or asking a manufacturer to issue a recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No recall for D402 tires has been ordered by federal safety regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/treading-dangerously-lax-safety-inside-goodyears-tire-plants/&quot;&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; by Reveal published in December found that Goodyear’s lax approach to safety contributed to the deaths of motorists on the road and workers in its plants. The tire giant ranked among the top five manufacturers in the United States for worker deaths since 2009, according to Reveal’s analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, at least four motorists over the last seven years have died in vehicle accidents after tires made at Goodyear plants failed. Those tires were manufactured in plants where intense production demands and leaks in the roof have endangered both workers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story detailed how some protections for factory workers are being dismantled. The Trump administration has rolled back and postponed Obama-era protections in keeping with goals laid out by the National Association of Manufacturers.&lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.goodyear.com/en-US/about/leadership.html&quot;&gt; Richard Kramer&lt;/a&gt;, Goodyear’s chairman, chief executive officer and president, serves on the association’s board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reveal’s investigation prompted an&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/blog/goodyear-statement-we-fell-short-on-safety-at-plants/&quot;&gt; immediate response&lt;/a&gt; from Goodyear in which a company spokeswoman called the company’s safety record “unacceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s top post has been vacant since President Donald Trump took office, leaving its enforcement policy hanging in the balance. The Trump administration included $914.7 million for the agency in its proposed budget for the 2019 fiscal year, up from its current budget of $905.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency’s deputy administrator, Heidi King, was appointed last fall and Trump recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2018/04/06/trump-nhtsa-heidi-king/&quot;&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to nominate her to fill the top job, subject to Senate confirmation. She previously trained as an economist and research scientist and served as a regulatory policy analyst in the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. An agency spokesman declined to make King available for an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearing before a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee in February, King&lt;a href=&quot;https://energycommerce.house.gov/hearings/oversight-national-highway-traffic-safety-administration-2/&quot;&gt; told&lt;/a&gt; lawmakers that “NHTSA is acting on its mission of saving lives. … Safety is, safety remains the department’s top priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Claybrook said the agency “is grossly underfunded.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It does not have the resources to do its job nationwide,” she said. “Therefore, it’s very cautious about whether it opens an investigation, and therefore, it tries not to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Kane, founder and president of Safety Research &amp; Strategies, a research organization based in Massachusetts, said the federal agency’s lack of leadership has created a void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t have clear policy direction from the top, you will have constant swings,” he said. “Those swings can affect how things are dealt with from a safety and public health perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An expert witness for motorists who have sued Goodyear has blamed manufacturing defects, which he says have caused tires to leak pressure or come off their rims, prompting drivers to veer and lose control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They negligently let defective tires go out the door,” said William Woehrle, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tireforensics.com/&quot;&gt;a tire expert&lt;/a&gt; in Michigan who has been paid as an expert witness in about a dozen cases involving D402 tires that failed. “They have had a systemic problem with manufacturing Dunlop D402 motorcycle tires.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between mid-2003 and early 2015, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the plant where the tires were made more than $20,000 for seven safety violations – all but one of them serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorcycle riders are especially vulnerable to injuries in the event of a tire blowout. Unlike companies that produce passenger cars, motorcycle manufacturers are not required to install tire pressure monitoring systems to warn drivers when tires are underinflated, which can lead to tire failures. The monitors became standard in cars and SUVs manufactured since 2007. And unlike rules for vehicle tires, federal rules do not require the rim on motorcycle tires to contain the tire when it develops a flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, when the tire blew out on Steven Morris’ motorcycle, the bike zigzagged between lanes and careened off the highway into the scrub grass. As the bike skidded onto its side, Patricia Morris fell off, smashing her head on the pavement in the breakdown lane. She was flown to a hospital in Atlanta, where she died several hours later. She was 50 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Morris broke his ankle, three ribs and scapula. He also suffered a concussion, leaving him with permanent short-term memory loss. Both Patricia and Steven were wearing helmets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dunlop D402 tire that blew out had just 700 miles on it. It had been “defectively manufactured” less than a year before the wreck, according to Gary Derian, a mechanical engineer hired to testify in a lawsuit Morris brought against Goodyear Dunlop Tires North America Ltd. and Harley-Davidson Motor Co., the Milwaukee-based motorcycle manufacturer. The tire was made at what was then the Goodyear Dunlop plant in Tonawanda, New York, near Buffalo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;<mark>Sumitomo Rubber Industries</mark> Ltd.&lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.goodyear.com/en-US/media/news/goodyear-sri-reach-agreement.html&quot;&gt; acquired&lt;/a&gt; Goodyear’s 75 percent interest in Goodyear Dunlop, including ownership of the Tonawanda plant, in 2015. (Prior to that, Sumitomo had a 25 percent interest in Goodyear Dunlop.) All the tires involved in the accidents examined by Reveal were made at the plant before 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Inspection of the tire reveals an adhesion defect in the tire cords that led to its failure,” Derian wrote in&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4376346-Rule-26-Derian-6-18-10-Copy.html&quot;&gt; a report&lt;/a&gt; submitted as part of court documents in Morris’ lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodyear Dunlop&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4407104-Answer-Goodyear-7-20-09-Doc-15.html&quot;&gt; argued&lt;/a&gt; that the tire was underinflated and overloaded. Morris later settled in 2010 with Goodyear Dunlop and Harley-Davidson for undisclosed amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failures of D402 tires stretch back at least a dozen years, records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the earliest cases identified by Reveal, Stephen Gageby, who was 50, was killed in 2007 after the back tire on his motorcycle failed on a highway just east of Missoula, Montana. Gageby’s wife, Karla, 57, was thrown from the bike. She spent the next two months in the hospital, where she was treated for a ruptured spleen, broken scapula and traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She later brought a lawsuit in Montana against Goodyear, Goodyear Dunlop Tires North America and Harley-Davidson, alleging that a defective tire caused the crash. The lawsuit claimed that the edge of the tire that connects to the rim, called the bead, leaked, causing the blowout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karla Gageby’s expert witness in the case was Woehrle, who&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4372065-Gageby-Expert-Witness-Report.html&quot;&gt; blamed&lt;/a&gt; a manufacturing defect. The tire deflated because of “leaks between the tire bead and the rim flange,” he wrote in a report submitted as part of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodyear argued that the motorcycle was overloaded. The case was settled in 2010 for an undisclosed amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I lost my husband,” Gageby said in a phone interview. “Obviously, that had the biggest impact. It totally messed my life up. I believe the tire was defective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She still struggles with memory problems, confusion, anxiety and fine motor problems. Doctors initially told her that she wouldn’t be able to function as she did before the crash, but she was able to return to her job as a case manager for the state’s Office of Public Assistance. Ultimately, the lasting effects of her injuries forced her to retire in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She and her husband were longtime members of a local Harley-Davidson group. Stephen Gageby was known as an outspoken advocate for safety, pulling new riders aside to give them pointers and imploring others to wear protective gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My husband was also a truck driver, so he was always checking the pressure on the tires,” Karla Gageby said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on the day of the accident, he was not wearing his helmet, which Gageby – who was wearing hers – says was out of character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2016/04/22/tds-2-accidents-on-interstate-15-injure-motorcyclist-drivers/#.WuOSmtPwbmH&quot;&gt;fatal accident&lt;/a&gt;, in April 2016, Brett and Angela Nielson were returning from a vacation in Nevada to their home in Utah when the back tire on their Harley blew out, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4378255-Police-Report-00504082-5.html&quot;&gt;records show&lt;/a&gt;. The bike wobbled before veering off the highway and rolling over, catapulting the couple into the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brett, 50, a longtime sheriff’s sergeant for the Millard County Sheriff’s Office, hit a post and died. Angela, then 48, landed in sagebrush. She was flown to a Utah hospital, where she was treated for breaks in her pelvis, neck vertebrae, both legs and ribs and other injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorities appeared to blame the tire failure for contributing to the wreck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Inspection of the motorcycle and tire marks on scene suggest that the rear tire of the motorcycle failed causing the driver to lose control,”&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4366977-Police-Report-Nielson.html#document/p2/a402861&quot;&gt; according&lt;/a&gt; to a Utah Highway Patrol report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the officer inspected the back tire, he found the sidewall on its right side was blown out and “the tread appeared to have numerous cracks and signs of separation.”&lt;/p&gt;

Their goal is to make a better golf ball by optimizing the size and pattern of these dimples and lowering the drag golf balls encounter as they fly through the air. </P><P>&quot;For a golf ball, drag reduction means that the ball flies farther,&quot; says ASU's Clinton Smith, a Ph.D. student who is presenting a talk on the research on Sunday, November 23, 2008 in San Antonio. Smith and his advisor Kyle Squires conducted in collaboration with Nikolaos Beratlis and Elias Balaras at the University of Maryland and Masaya Tsunoda of <mark>Sumitomo Rubber Industries</mark>, Ltd.</P><P>It's no secret that dimples improve the flight of a golf ball. Once in flight, a golf ball experiences aerodynamic forces generated from the surrounding air flow as well as gravity. The latter constantly pulls it towards the ground, while the aerodynamic force in the direction of motion, or drag force, dictates the distance it travels. The main purpose of dimples is to reduce the drag and help the ball fly farther. Actually, dimpled golf balls experience about half the drag as those with no dimples. Although the United States Golf Association (USGA) regulates the design of golfballs, laying out uniform size and weight specifications that all approved golf balls must meet, the dimple pattern is not regulated. It is one of the very few parts of the ball over which companies have freedom to change the design. But what pattern is best for lowering the drag? </P><P>Up to now, dimple design has been more of an art than a science. For many years, sporting goods companies would design their dimple patterns by simple trial and error, testing prototype after prototype against one another. The new study takes a different approach, asking how to design dimple size and pattern based on mathematical equations that model the physics of a golf ball in flight. Working out the solution to these equations -- even on the fastest personal computers today -- is not feasible since it would take more than 15 years of computing time just to get a glimpse of the flow around the golf ball for a fraction of a second. </P><P>Nikolaos Beratlis, a Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, and his advisor Elias Balaras have been developing highly efficient algorithms and software to solve these equations on parallel supercomputers, which can reduce the simulation time to the order of hours. The number crunching for a typical computation, for example, takes approximately 300 hours using 500 fast processors running in parallel (normal desktop computers may have one or two slower processors).</P><P>The group's work presented by Smith in San Antonio will summarize their research. So far, they have characterized air flow around a golf ball at the finest level of detail ever attempted, teasing out the drag at each exact location and showing how air flows in an out of each tiny dimple on a golf ball's surface as it spins through the air during flight.</P><P>In the end, they produced a model that reveals the physics of a flying golf ball with the greatest level of detail ever seen -- the first step in achieving the project's long-term goal of optimizing dimple design to realize the lowest drag possible. The next step, says Smith, is to extend the work by comparing different dimple designs. </P><P>New designs are still years away at best, however, so don't give up the driving range just yet. </P><P>The talk, &quot;Direct Numerical Simulations of the Flow around a Golf Ball: Effect of Rotation&quot; by will take place at 4:49 p.m. on Sunday, November 23, 2008 in Room 201 of the Gonzales Convention Center in San Antonio, TX.

But the town of Tonawanda, a working-class Buffalo suburb 13 miles downstream of America’s most storied waterfalls, also lost its biggest taxpayer.</P><P>The impact of Huntley’s decade-long slowdown — and finally shutdown — hit this upstate New York community like a punch to the gut.</P><P>In just five years, between 2008 and 2012, Huntley’s pre-tax earnings tumbled by $113 million as it operated far below capacity, translating into a combined revenue hit of at least $6.2 million to the town, county and local school district. That precipitous decline came when state education funds were also shrinking. Belt-tightening wasn’t enough; 140 teachers lost their jobs. Three elementary schools and one middle school closed their doors.</P><P>Rebecca Newberry, a 35-year-old former bartender and LGBT-rights activist, saw her hometown facing the same fate that has befallen so many other Rust Belt communities that fell on hard times following an industrial exodus. She was determined not to let it happen to the place where she grew up. And she was fortunate enough to find a diverse group of allies who were willing to fight for their survival.</P><P>By combining the resources of her nonprofit, the Clean Air Coalition of Western New York, with area labor unions and other community groups, Newberry helped to hatch a plan for Tonawanda’s next chapter — and provide an inclusive, equitable template for other blue-collar towns facing the loss of dirty energy jobs and other polluting industries. (The jargony term for this in advocacy circles is “just transitions.”)</P><DIV id=""attachment_176827"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 823px""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">The retired Huntley Generating Station on the banks of the Niagara River. (Image courtesy of Google Earth)</P></DIV><P>The group that Newberry helped form would come to be known as the Huntley Alliance. The partnership convinced New York lawmakers to provide Tonawanda with a temporary cash infusion to sustain the town as it reinvents its tax base — the first time a state has offered a financial cushion to a community that was financially reliant on a coal-fired power plant.</P><P>“It was a trauma when Huntley finally announced it was closing,” Newberry says, “so we had to come at this from a place of healing. Our goal was to stop the bleeding to the industrial and public sectors.</P><P>“Always, our key question is: How are we going to take care of our people?”</P><P> <STRONG><SPAN style=""font-size: 120%;"">Team of rivals</SPAN></STRONG></P><P>Tonawanda, a Native American word meaning swift waters, was founded by white settlers in 1836. East of the railroad tracks that run north from Buffalo to Niagara Falls, the 20-square mile town has nearly 73,000 residents and is known for its <A href=""http://www.kentonbee.com/news/2016-03-23/Editorial/Tonawandas_paramedic_unit_is_one_of_a_kind.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">top-flight paramedic service</A>.</P><P>But west of the tracks, it’s anything but quaint. Huntley and 50-plus industrial facilities coexist within a three-mile radius, mingled with older homes and trailer parks. Big grinding trucks assault the ears, and the air carries a distinct petroleum-rubber-chemical-exhaust stink.</P><P>The energy giant NRG purchased Huntley in 1999. Although the oldest current coal-fired unit dates back to 1942, the facility’s steam-generating history stretches back to World War I. NRG retired half of the plant’s 760-megawatt capacity in 2006 and 2007, with a corresponding drop in tax revenue.</P><P>In the fall of 2013, Peter Stuhlmiller, president of the Kenmore-Tonawanda Teachers Association, reached out to Richard Lipsitz, president of the local AFL-CIO chapter, to figure out how to save the community’s schools. They were soon joined by Newberry’s coalition, the Sierra Club and trade unions representing steelworkers and Huntley employees.</P><P>“This country has a very poor record of rescuing communities built up around coal and heavy industries,” Lipsitz says. “Our goal was to stabilize the economy and provide income for a town that needed it desperately.”</P><DIV id=""attachment_176828"" class=""wp-caption alignleft"" style=""width: 350px""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Huntley Alliance members Rebecca Newberry (top left), Richard Lipsitz (top right), Peter Stuhlmiller (bottom left), Diana Strablow (bottom right). (Photo by Elizabeth McGowan).</P></DIV><P>Although their goal was the same, the various factions in the early Huntley Alliance had different priorities. The united front fell apart when a local Sierra Club member organized a protest calling for Huntley’s closure — with some demonstrators wearing union shirts. Labor leaders felt the rally threatened the livelihoods of the 70-plus remaining NRG employees. Finger-pointing ensued, and the plant’s union walked away from the nascent alliance.</P><P>Then the whole effort collapsed.</P><P>Newberry’s Clean Air Coalition didn’t join the Big Green’s call for Huntley’s closure — although it harangued other major polluters along the industrial waterfront during its decade of existence. The group’s leaders saw no need: The coal plant’s obsolescence seemed imminent with cheap natural gas flooding US markets.</P><P>To motivate the Huntley Alliance to regroup, Newberry circulated preliminary results of a study her 200-member nonprofit commissioned. “Given that the plant is located in a region with substantial excess capacity for at least the next decade, the Huntley units appear ripe for retirement,” the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis <A href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_qWeYLAqoq1QUFEeUhKbmRiU2c/edit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">concluded in a 24-page report</A> released in January 2014.</P><P>That sobering prediction did the trick, ending the alliance’s six-month hiatus. Newberry — who ascended to the top job at the Clean Air Coalition in 2015, four years after being hired — insisted that workers couldn’t be left behind. It became the group’s guiding principle and managed to hold together unlikely allies. Teachers rubbed shoulders with steelworkers and teamsters. Male-dominated trade unions listened to women’s ideas. Labor and Big Green found common ground.</P><P>“Going through this helps me to visualize that we can do better as a society,” Newberry says. “We don’t always have to be fighting with one another.”</P><P>At least 1,500 members of the steelworkers union live in the Tonawanda area, many drawing paychecks at employers such as Tonawanda Coke, 3M, DuPont and Sumitomo Rubber. They backed the alliance’s focus on job retention and creation, because they feared property taxes would spike after Huntley’s shutdown — to make up for lost revenues from the plant. That could spook existing employers and repel potential newcomers.</P><P>“We want to make sure there are good, clean, high-road, family-sustaining jobs that improve the quality of life,” says Dave Wasiura, the union’s organizing coordinator for the area.</P><P>Retired teacher Diana Strablow, a member of both the Sierra Club and Newberry’s group, was initially frustrated that the dangers of <mark>climate change</mark> sparked by coal-fired power plants weren’t the alliance’s number one priority. But Newberry helped her understand how a stumble by Huntley could mean a fall for her entire community.</P><P>“I was the angry environmentalist,” Strablow says. “I’ve learned we need to take care of both our workers and our environment.”</P><P> <STRONG><SPAN style=""font-size: 120%;"">Don’t ask. Tell.</SPAN></STRONG></P><P>Once reunited, the Huntley Alliance needed clear goals — specifically ones that met the needs of the town’s residents. Through a series of listening sessions, door-to-door surveys and voter-registration drives, the partnership channeled the hopes and anxieties of hundreds of residents. The wish list that emerged included keeping schools intact, creating good-paying jobs, expanding the tax base and improving public health and the environment.</P><P>Those desires would be compiled with proposals and needs of businesses and other stakeholders into Tonawanda Tomorrow, a succinct blueprint for the town’s trajectory. <A href=""http://tonawandatomorrow.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A final version</A> was released in June.</P><P>It was a tall order, so the alliance set about lobbying New York state legislators for “gap funds” to keep the town afloat during its transformation. After all, Newberry reasoned, Huntley had supplied electricity far beyond Tonawanda’s borders. Rather than asking lawmakers to find money for them, Newberry and her colleagues combed through the state’s budget themselves and compiled a list of potential funding pots to draw from.</P><P>By August 2015, when NRG announced Huntley’s impending retirement, a Democrat-majority State Assembly and a Republican-controlled Senate had already voted to back the alliance’s brainchild. When the 102-acre power plant went offline seven months later, the framework was in place for $30 million.</P><P>Cynthia Winland, a planning specialist at Chicago’s Delta Institute, praised New York legislators for being brave enough to act on Tonawanda’s financial request. Her <mark>sustainable</mark> solutions nonprofit helped assemble the town’s blueprint.</P><P>“If a state as geographically, politically and economically complicated as New York is capable of this,” Winland says, “then other states can look for parallels.”</P><DIV id=""attachment_176829"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 823px""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Community members give feedback on a draft of the Tonawanda Tomorrow plan at a public workshop in May.

Andrew Cuomo’s announcement last year that New York would strive to be coal-free by 2020. The gap fund’s budget ballooned from $30 million to $45 million, its availability was extended from five to seven years. (It now covers communities with plants powered by any fuel source.)</P><P>The initial funding makes Tonawanda’s post-Huntley metamorphosis viable, Newberry says, adding that the two-year extension “gives us the extra breathing room we will need.”</P><P>The fund so far has shored-up the school system — which is no longer hemorrhaging teachers — stopped electricity bills from skyrocketing, and kept the budget for the prized paramedic unit intact.</P><P>David Schlissel, a coauthor of the 2014 report questioning the Huntley Generating Station’s viability, emphasized that the alliance’s proactive approach and the New York legislature’s response offer a vital lesson for the rest of the country.</P><P>“Instead of spending millions on propping up coal plants,” Schlissel says, “we need to spend money to help communities make an economic transition.”</P><P>The Huntley Alliance took its cues from other communities forced to evolve beyond heavy industry. Members traveled as close as Appalachia and as far as Germany, where they were amazed to witness how the German government funded worker retraining programs and recycled old production plants, as renewables supplanted fossil fuels.</P><P>“That gave us hope that a cleaner environment can be achieved in Tonawanda without leaving broken workers behind,” Newberry says.</P><P>Back home, the alliance’s efforts also benefitted from a $160,000 grant from an Obama administration initiative to help communities distressed by the demise of coal. President Trump proposed defunding the program in his 2018 budget.</P><P> <STRONG><SPAN style=""font-size: 120%;"">Not another Bethlehem Steel</SPAN></STRONG></P><P>Even with all the planning, the Huntley station’s idle smokestacks cause jitters among Tonawandans who have watched the 1,000-acre Bethlehem Steel plant idle in Lackawanna, 20 miles to the south, for three and a half decades.

They included a bioenergy plant, an industrial heritage museum, and much-needed green space. River access along the town’s six miles of shoreline is now limited to one sliver of parkland south of the power plant.</P><P>That’s in contrast to the town’s northern neighbor — a significantly smaller city, confusingly also named Tonawanda — where a lush, verdant ribbon beckons visitors to the riverfront. A pockmarked bicycle/pedestrian path in the town suddenly turns pristine at the city line.</P><P>“We have a clear pathway forward,” Newberry says. But questions about what will become of the Huntley site make it clear, she adds, that “our work is not over.”</P><P>Unlike the Bethlehem Steel site, Huntley is not eligible for New York’s Superfund Program, says Erica Ringewald, a state Department of Environmental Conservation spokeswoman. However, NRG or a future owner that takes on the remediation effort could qualify for tax credits through the state’s brownfield cleanup program.</P><P>A preliminary to-do list at the site includes moving an 11-acre pile of unused Powder River Basin coal to a 116-acre NRG landfill about a mile away; closing a coal-ash lagoon; and continuing to clean 11 petroleum bulk storage tanks. But according to a state environmental assessment, contamination levels there do not “represent a significant threat to human health or the environment.”</P><P>“I don’t have a crystal ball, so I don’t know how long this takes,” NRG spokesman David Gaier says, adding that the company is just beginning the long-term decommissioning process for Huntley. “But you don’t go from a working power plant to condos in a year.”</P><P>Emminger, the town supervisor, isn’t envisioning condominiums — or any other type of housing — at the waterfront site. “Residential is too risky there,” he says, adding that light industry is more likely.</P><P>“We have a proud industrial past,” Emminger notes. “Hopefully, it’s going to be part of our future.”</P><P><EM>First in <A href=""http://grist.org/series/extreme-community-makeover/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">a series</A> on communities overcoming obstacles to become cleaner and greener.</EM></P><P><EM>Funding for this article was provided by a <A href=""http://solutionsjournalism.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Solutions Journalism Network</A> grant.</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The overarching goal of the $5 million project, which is supported by a coalition of government agencies, foundations and industry partners, is to ascertain what needs to be done to make sure that high-value buildings, such as hospitals and data centers, remain operational after going through an earthquake. Researchers also will assess whether the building's fire barriers have been affected by the shakes.</P><P>Throughout the two weeks of testing, engineers will monitor the building's performance with more than 500 high-fidelity sensors and more than 70cameras that will record the movement of key elements and components inside the building.</P><P>&quot;What we are doing is the equivalent of giving a building an EKG to see how it performs after an earthquake and a post-earthquake fire,&quot; said Professor Tara Hutchinson of the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego, the project's lead principal investigator.</P><P>Hutchinson is working with a multi-disciplinary team of academics and industry representatives, including Jacobs School Professors Jose Restrepo and Joel Conte.</P><P>The two-week series of experiments will feature a number of firsts:</P><P>This is the first time in the United States that tests focus on a broad range of nonstructural systems and equipment that can malfunction during an earthquake, such as a working elevator, stairs and a broad array of medical equipment. The tests also include modern ceiling systems, a heating and air conditioning system, functional sprinklers, computer servers, large and small laboratory equipment, and electrical equipment and wiring. Over the past three decades, the majority of losses caused by earthquakes can be attributed to damage to nonstructural elements such as these. The 80-foot-tall structure also is equipped with a large water tower and an air conditioning and heating unit on its roof. The exterior of the building is complete with heavy precast concrete cladding as well as synthetic stucco, each commonly used in commercial construction.</P><P>This is also the first time that a base isolation system will be tested under a full-scale building on a shake table in the United States. The system is composed of large cylindrical rubber bearings that isolate the five-story building from most of the lateral motion it would normally experience during a temblor. Similar systems have been used to retrofit the Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco city halls, among other structures. Base isolation also is used in new construction in the United States and is fairly widespread in Japan. The method is particularly useful for shorter, stiffer buildings rather than taller buildings such as high-rises. During the second week of testing, the base isolation bearings will be removed and the building's foundation will be anchored directly on the shake table.</P><P>This is the first time that a building will undergo fire testing after being put through a series of simulated seismic events. Researchers from UC San Diego and the department of fire protection engineering at the Worchester Polytechnic Institute will first study the performance of active and passive fire protection systems, which will provide insight into damage caused by earthquakes. Then, in May, engineers will conduct fire tests in the building, tracking temperatures and the movement of smoke to help gauge the potential for fire spread in an earthquake-damaged building.</P><P>&quot;The tests will have a significant impact on how engineers model the nonstructural components of a building and how they calculate what forces they need to withstand during an earthquake,&quot; Hutchinson said. &quot;We can improve our understanding of their performance and accuracy of design predictions by using data generated from tests such as these,&quot; she said. &quot;We are hoping that our work will help prevent unnecessary loss of life and loss of property.&quot;</P><P>Researchers also hope to better understand what needs to be done to make sure medical centers remain operational after a temblor. The building's top two floors are outfitted with a surgery suite and intensive care unit, two components of the project supported by the California Seismic Safety Commission, which investigates earthquakes and recommends to the governor and state legislature policies that will reduce earthquake risks.</P><P>Likewise, the fire-related data will help engineers model the fire performance of buildings damaged in earthquakes. &quot;Knowing how fire protection systems might fail in an earthquake, and how the fire and smoke might spread, will allow us to design more resilient systems and provide better protection to people, property and mission,&quot; said Brian Meacham, associate professor of fire protection engineering at WPI.</P><P><STRONG>Measuring the building's performance</STRONG></P><P>Sensors will be placed strategically throughout the building to measure how components perform. For example, 230 accelerometers will measure how fast the building and its nonstructural components moved during the simulated temblors. In addition, 160 sensors, including high resolution GPS devices, will measure the relative displacement between two points, while 50 strain gauges will measure the deformation of the rebar that are buried in the building's concrete foundations. About 80 cameras will be focused on the building, with most of these distributed within the interior of the building to monitor the nonstructural elements during the tests.</P><P><STRONG>Simulated earthquakes</STRONG></P><P>During the two weeks of testing, researchers will put the buildings through a variety of simulated temblors, using motions that have been recorded from:</P><P>The 1994, 6.7-magnitude Northridge earthquake.</P><P>The 2002, 7.9-magnitude earthquake that took place in Denali, Alaska, these motions are similar to seismic events that could occur in Southern and Central California.</P><P>The 2010, 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile and the 2007, 8.0-magnitude earthquake in Peru. The Chile and Peru events produced ground motions that could occur in the Cascadia subduction zone off of the coast of Northern California, in Crescent City and Eureka, for example.</P><P>On April 17, the building will be subjected to motions recorded during the 1994 Northridge and 2010 Chile earthquakes.</P><P><STRONG>Other components</STRONG></P><P>During this complex series, researchers also will be investigating the performance of nonstructural systems, which provide evacuation support for the occupants of a building. &quot;In the 2011 Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand, and in other past earthquakes, stairs have failed in some buildings,&quot; Restrepo pointed out. Scientists hope the tests will help find ways to keep elevators and stairs safe and functional after a major temblor.</P><P>Other components of the project include computer servers and laboratory equipment on the third floor. The five-story building also is outfitted with two different kinds of façade: the two top floors consist of heavy, precast concrete panels, while the three lower floors are covered with flexible metal studs overlaid with gypsum board and light-weight stucco, with the studs constructed using a multi-floor spanning strategy known as a balloon framing.</P><P><STRONG>Fire testing</STRONG></P><P>During the seismic tests, researchers from WPI, led by Meacham, will regularly inspect passive fire protection components, including doors, ceiling systems, partition walls and fire resistant materials that seal openings in walls, to see how they are faring. If these systems are compromised, they could allow flames and smoke to spread and air to enter a room to feed a fire. They will also inspect the condition of active fire suppression systems, particularly sprinklers.</P><P>In mid-May, following the two weeks of seismic testing, the WPI team will perform two days of fire testing on the third floor of the building. They will ignite pans of heptane, a liquid fuel that burns hot enough to simulate full burning within a closed space. Using sensors that record temperature and smoke movement, researchers will assess how damage from the simulated earthquakes affect the ability of the active and passive fire protection systems to contain fires and prevent the spread of smoke. Though fires that take place after earthquakes are a well-known and serious hazard, very little is known about the performance of fire protection systems in earthquakes, Meacham said. The data gathered through this research could help inform more effective fire codes. In addition, this study will provide a unique opportunity to simultaneously observe the effects of shaking and fire on building systems, which could lead to new multi-hazard computer models that could help architects and engineers design safer buildings.</P><P>Meanwhile, Hutchinson, Restrepo, Conte and their colleagues will spend the following year analyzing data from the project before publishing their complete findings. The team also includes academic partners Ken Walsh of San Diego State University, Claudia Marin, of Howard University and Brian Meacham of Worcester Polytechnic University.</P><P>The project is sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation, the California Seismic Safety Commission, the Charles Pankow Foundation, the Englekirk Advisory Board, the Society of Fire Protection Engineers and a large consortium of U.S. and international industry partners.</P></DIV><DIV class=""mobile-middle-rectangle hidden-md hidden-lg""><DIV class=""textrule""><SPAN>advertisement</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""story_source""><P><STRONG>Story Source:</STRONG></P><P><A href=""http://www.newswise.com/articles/engineers-put-five-story-building-on-seismic-shake-table-to-test-earthquake-and-fire-readiness"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Materials</A> provided by <A href=""http://www.ucsd.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>University of California, San Diego</STRONG></A>. <EM>Note: Content may be edited for style and length.</EM></P></DIV><DIV id=""citations""><DIV role=""tabpanel"" class=""right-tabs clearfix""><P class=""pull-left""><STRONG>Cite This Page</STRONG>:</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The aim of this article is therefore to analyze the determinants of such strategies and their influence on firms' financial and <mark>carbon</mark> performance over time. It is argued that corporate <mark>carbon</mark> strategies have three main objectives: <mark>carbon</mark> governance, <mark>carbon</mark> reduction and <mark>carbon</mark> competitiveness. To assess the complex interactions between these strategic objectives, their determinants and outcomes, an integrative structural equation model is developed and empirically tested. Data are sourced from a global sample of 45 leading enterprises from the steel, cement and automotive sector, including some of the largest GHG emitters in the world. In order to account for the long-term impacts of strategies, the firm-level change in financial and <mark>carbon</mark> performance is calculated by comparing two different points in time, namely 2008 and 2013. The results provide empirical evidence for the positive effect of institutional and stakeholder pressure on emission reduction activities. Proof for a positive impact of <mark>carbon</mark> pressure on organizational capabilities and corporate competitiveness in the context of <mark>climate change</mark> cannot be established. Surprisingly, the results also indicate no relationship between <mark>carbon</mark> reduction activities and long-term improvements in <mark>carbon</mark> performance. However, such measures are linked to long-term financial gains. Advancements in <mark>carbon</mark> performance, in turn, are not found to be associated with economic benefits.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><UL class=""issue-navigation"" id=""issue-navigation""><LI class=""previous""><BUTTON class=""button-alternative button-alternative-tertiary"" disabled="""" type=""button""><SPAN class=""button-alternative-text""><SPAN><STRONG>Previous </STRONG>article<SPAN class=""extra-detail""> in issue</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></BUTTON></LI></UL></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
