J. Johnson-Bell, discusses the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on grapes grown for wine production.  Johnson-Bell establishes that she is not a scientist and that her perspective is that of a wine-tasting connoisseur.  Johnson-Bell’s goal is not to debate the reality of anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>, rather to discuss the impacts of the changing <mark>climate</mark> on vineyards and wine makers.  Through this perspective, the book argues that without reducing the anthropogenic influences on <mark>climate change</mark>, the taste of our wine will change.  Johnson-Bell uses her passion for wine and writing abilities to inspire her readers to take action against <mark>climate change</mark>.Johnson-Bell approaches the topic by initially explaining how winemakers grow their grapes, and how certain conditions impact the grapes and the wines.  Specifications such as temperatures, terroir conditions, and soil play very important roles in how grapes are grown.  This establishes the importance of how grapes are grown and the conditions at which they are growth.  The chapter shows how the conditions controlled by winemakers impact the grapes and ultimately the taste of the wine.After describing how the conditions impact the grapes, Johnson-Bell explains the current problems faced by winemakers.  This section focused in large on extreme weather conditions, rather than just the increasing temperatures.  Johnson-Bell discusses how unpredictable and uncharacteristic weather causes major problems in vineyards.  Most winemakers feel that as soon as they’re recovered from one unanticipated event, they’re face with another extreme weather condition.  These extreme weather patterns cannot be controlled by winemakers; winemakers can react to <mark>climate change</mark>s, but are constrained by their inability to predict the weather.  These changes are the biggest influence in the changing taste of wine.Next, Johnson-Bell discusses the various shifts that winemakers have made to account for extreme weather caused by <mark>climate change</mark>.  Despite winemakers attempt to trouble shoot, wine is increasingly produced with higher alcohol levels, atypical aromatic ranges, and denser textures.  Therefore, despite accommodations for the extreme conditions caused by global <mark>climate change</mark>, wine as we know it is changing.  In the last part of the book, Johnson-Bell proposes what wat winemaking may look like in the future, if <mark>climate change</mark> continues at the current rate.  In this outline, key changes include a “cease or decrease” of wine production in typical European wine countries such as Spain, France, and Italy.  Additionally, there will be emerging wine regions in northern Europe such as Denmark, England, and Sweden.  Despite the idyllic temperature conditions in these new regions, the terroir and soil will be different than the current conditions for grape growing.  This change is not necessarily bad, however, they will produce wine that tastes different than the current wine we drink.  In the conclusion of her book, Johnson-Bell is that if <mark>climate change</mark> continues that “good wine” as we currently known it will change.In conclusion, Johnson-Bell’s book inadvertently call the readers to take action against <mark>climate change</mark>.  I would recommend this book to any wine connoisseurs, with or without a scientific background, who are hesitant to support the fight against global warming.</DIV></DIV></SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Russ Feingold, who is seeking a third term. Johnson also faces small-business man Dave Westlake in the September GOP primary election.</P><P>A global warming skeptic, Johnson said extreme weather phenomena were better explained by sunspots than an overload of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere, as many scientists believe.</P><P>&quot;I absolutely do not believe in the science of man-caused <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;It's not proven by any stretch of the imagination.&quot;</P><P>Johnson, in an interview last month, described believers in manmade causes of <mark>climate change</mark> as &quot;crazy&quot; and the theory as &quot;lunacy.&quot;</P><P>&quot;It's far more likely that it's just sunspot activity or just something in the geologic eons of time,&quot; he said.</P><P>Excess <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere &quot;gets sucked down by trees and helps the trees grow,&quot; said Johnson.</P><P>Average Earth temperatures were relatively warm during the Middle Ages, Johnson said, and &quot;it's not like there were tons of cars on the road.&quot;</P><P>He said he disagreed with any government spending to try to address global warming. A strong economy is the best way to preserve a good environment, Johnson said.</P><P>Trying to fix global warming is &quot;a fool's errand,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;I don't think we can do anything about controlling what our <mark>climate</mark> is.&quot;</P><P>Johnson also said his comments on drilling for oil in the Great Lakes had been misconstrued by Feingold, who ran TV ads criticizing Johnson and calling him a proponent of Great Lakes drilling. </P><P>Johnson said when he told an interviewer that &quot;we have to get the oil where the oil is,&quot; he didn't hear any reference to the Great Lakes in the interviewer's question. </P><P>Besides, the Great Lakes oil reserves are too small to be worth drilling, Johnson said.</P><P>On Supreme Court nominees, Johnson said he had no &quot;litmus test&quot; to support or oppose a candidate. However, he said he would vote against a nominee whose views he disagreed with and would filibuster a nominee with views he strongly opposed. </P><P>The filibuster is a debate tactic used by the minority party in the Senate to delay or block votes.</P><P>&quot;If I would see a justice who I really thought was awful, in terms of judicial you know, what rulings they had in the past, I would certainly be willing to filibuster,&quot; Johnson said. </P><P>He said he preferred justices who would strictly follow the constitution in their rulings.</P><P>He said he would have voted against both of President Obama's Supreme Court appointees, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, as well as both appointees of President Clinton - Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. </P><P>John Kraus, a campaign spokesman for Feingold, said Johnson's &quot;extreme views on <mark>climate change</mark> are not only out of touch with the voters of Wisconsin, but they are out of touch with reality.&quot; </P><P>Feingold has taken a completely opposite position on global warming, saying that &quot;most people think man had some role in it.&quot;</P><P>It's extreme and irresponsible, Feingold told a Journal Sentinel reporter last month, to completely dismiss man's role.</P><P>&quot;Do you notice the heat lately, my friend?&quot;</P><P>Kraus also chided Johnson for his stance on Supreme Court nominees, saying Johnson didn't understand the Senate's role.</P><P>&quot;It's not about whether he agrees or disagrees with the nominee, or whether the nominee agrees or disagrees with Mr. Johnson,&quot; Kraus said. &quot;The issue is whether or not the nominee will be a fair and impartial justice.&quot;</P><P>Feingold believes in giving deference to the president on judicial nominations, said Kraus. Feingold voted to confirm John Roberts, one of Republican President George W. Bush's Supreme Court nominees, but voted against Samuel Alito, Bush's other nominee to the high court.</P><P>Johnson offered a more nuanced view on government stimulus. Though he remains critical of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the bank bailout,  Johnson said he doesn't disavow all deficit government spending as a boon during a severe recession.</P><P>He said he would have supported a narrower stimulus program that targeted infrastructure projects, in addition to targeted tax cuts as incentives to  investment.</P><P>&quot;Some stimulus is not a bad thing,&quot; Johnson said.</P><P>On other issues, Johnson:</P><P>• Was critical of the health care and financial industry reform laws passed this year. Both contributed to uncertainty for businesses, which inhibits growth, Johnson said. He favors repeal of both laws.</P><P>• Said tax cuts approved during Bush's term should be preserved. </P><P>• Said he favors laws to better secure the U.S. borders as a prerequisite to dealing with illegal immigration. </P><I>Dave Umhoefer of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report.</I><DIV class=""main--authorcards""><DIV class=""authorcards--author""><DIV class=""author--body""><H5 class=""author--name"">About Steve Schultze</H5>

Generally, simulations suggest certain trends for streamflow: that flow amount decreases in the Rockies and interior southwest, but increases in the northeast.

LISSS, a one-dimensional dynamic thermal simulation model, is applied to assess lake response to multiple mid-21st century change scenarios applied to nine baseline <mark>climate</mark> series from different hydroclimatic regions of the U.S. Results show surface water temperature increases of about 77 % of increase in average air temperature change. Bottom temperature changes are less (around 30 %) for deep lakes and in regions that maintain mid-winter air temperatures below freezing. Significant decreases in length of ice cover are projected, and the extent and strength of stratification will increase throughout the U.S., with systematic differences associated with depth, surface area, and clarity. These projected responses suggest a range of future challenges that lake managers are likely to face. Changes in thermal and mixing dynamics suggest increased risk of summer hypoxic conditions and cyanobacterial blooms.

Increased average air temperature over the past three decades has been associated with increases in mean lake temperature (e.g., Coates et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR3"">2006</A></SPAN>) and decreased ice cover (Magnuson et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR20"">2000</A></SPAN>). Warming of surface waters has increased the strength of thermal stratification (Rempfer et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR29"">2010</A></SPAN>), which leads to reduced mixing and, in some deeper lakes, a decrease in summer temperatures at depth (Livingstone <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR19"">2003</A></SPAN>; Coates et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR3"">2006</A></SPAN>).</P><P id=""Par3"" class=""Para""><mark>Climate change</mark> will affect air-water energy exchanges and further alter the temperature regime and mixing of lakes. In addition to heat exchanges, the response is modulated by lake geometry, wind stress, and light extinction rates in the water column. Lake surface area and depth affect strength of stratification (Stefan et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR32"">1996</A></SPAN>). Decreased wind speed and increased light attenuation are observed to increase stratification and reduce whole-lake average temperature (Tanentzap et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR36"">2008</A></SPAN>). Increased water clarity can warm deeper waters (Stefan et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR32"">1996</A></SPAN>). Reduced light penetration decreases mixing depth and can cause cooling in deeper water (Hocking and Straškraba <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR10"">1999</A></SPAN>), while summer surface water temperatures may increase or decline depending on the entrainment of colder hypolimnetic water (Persson and Jones <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR27"">2008</A></SPAN>).</P><P id=""Par4"" class=""Para"">Schmid et al. (<SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR31"">2014</A></SPAN>) evaluated the sensitivity of lake surface temperatures to <mark>climate change</mark> and predicted anomalies in lake surface equilibrium temperature in the range of 2–5 °C by the end of the 21st century. They estimated that surface equilibrium temperatures would increase by 70 to 85 % of air temperature changes, with most of the residual between-lake variance attributed to changes in relative humidity and, to a lesser extent, wind speed. Fang and Stefan (<SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR5"">1996</A></SPAN>) used a daily-scale one-dimensional temperature model to investigate potential <mark>climate</mark>-induced changes in thermal profiles of U.S. lakes under a doubling of CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations and predict relative sensitivities for surface water temperature similar to Schmid et al., accompanied by a decrease in ice cover, strong increases in hypolimnetic temperatures, and an increase in stratification strength, dependent on lake geometry. Their study used only a single GCM on a coarse (3.75° × 3.75°) scale and simulated response at a daily time step, which may obscure the details of mixing events that occur in response to diel variations in air temperature and solar energy input.</P><P id=""Par5"" class=""Para"">Longer periods of stratification increase the risk of hypolimnetic anoxia (Foley et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR8"">2012</A></SPAN>), which in turn increases the rate of recycling of phosphorus from lake sediment (Wilhelm and Adrian <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR40"">2008</A></SPAN>). Lake ecosystems are vulnerable to <mark>climate change</mark> because many lacustrine species have limited abilities to disperse to lakes with favorable conditions (Woodward et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR42"">2010</A></SPAN>) and reorganization of food webs may be a consequence of warming of lakes. Long-term temperature manipulation of experimental ponds in Denmark resulted in a shift in community structure to more turbid, plankton-dominated systems as temperature increased (Meerhoff et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR23"">2007</A></SPAN>). The retrospective study of Rühland et al. (<SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR30"">2008</A></SPAN>) and experimental studies of Strecker et al. (<SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR34"">2004</A></SPAN>) demonstrate that warming and changes in ice cover cause reorganization of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in minimally disturbed lakes. Interlandi et al. (<SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR15"">1999</A></SPAN>), studying lakes in the Yellowstone region, showed that changes in timing of water column mixing regulated the abundance of phytoplankton groups by controlling the relative timing of nutrient recycling versus light availability. <mark>Climate change</mark> is also likely to increase the spread of non-native invasive species (Rahel and Olden <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR28"">2008</A></SPAN>; Holzapfel and Vinebrooke <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR11"">2005</A></SPAN>).</P><P id=""Par6"" class=""Para"">These changes may impact human uses as well, with increased risk of cyanobacterial blooms, increased mobilization of soluble metals, and potential issues for potable water treatability as hypolimnetic oxygen depletion increases. Harmful cyanobacterial blooms are driven by increased anthropogenic nutrient loads, but are also associated with summer heat waves (Jöhnk et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR16"">2008</A></SPAN>). Paerl et al. (<SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR25"">2011</A></SPAN>) summarize important feedbacks with <mark>climate</mark> warming that are likely to favor cyanobacteria. An improved understanding of controls on lake sensitivity to <mark>climate change</mark> will help guide adaptation strategies.</P><P id=""Par7"" class=""Para"">In this study we focus on the responses of lake thermal structure and mixing regime to <mark>climate change</mark>, which in turn determine temperatures at the thermocline and in bottom water, and are expected to be less closely coupled to air temperature than lake surface temperature. The study builds on the work of Fang and Stefan (<SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR6"">2009</A></SPAN>) by using a similar set of lake archetypes, but extends their analyses by evaluating an ensemble of mid-21st century <mark>climate change</mark> scenarios including a complete set of internally consistent projected meteorological time series. We evaluate lake response to integrated <mark>climate</mark> projections that include simultaneous changes in a full suite of weather variables generated by dynamical downscaling at a 50 × 50 km scale and implement a lake simulation model forced at an hourly scale to resolve diel cycles of energy exchanges and shallow mixing events. We focus on lake thermal structure because it determines (1) the occurrence, intensity, and frequency of stratification and mixing events, (2) the percentage of lake volume that is mixed and in contact with the atmosphere, (3) the distribution of thermal habitat zones relative to the mixed, oxygenated zone of stratified lakes, and (4) the rates and timing of recycling of nutrients and other pollutants from lake sediments into the photic zone.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec2"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1 SectionTypeMaterialsAndMethods""><H2 class=""Heading""><SPAN class=""HeadingNumber"">2 </SPAN>Methods</H2><DIV class=""content""><P id=""Par8"" class=""Para"">Factors potentially influencing lake response to <mark>climate change</mark> include baseline <mark>climate</mark>, changes in <mark>climate</mark> forcing (energy and flow/mass inputs), lake geometry, and water clarity (which controls the depth of light and associated energy penetration into the water column).

In this study we use a corrected and enhanced version of the Hostetler 1-D lake thermal model code known as LISSS (Lake, Ice, Snow, and Sediment Simulator; Subin et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR35"">2012</A></SPAN>). LISSS was developed for the Community Land Model 4 (CLM4; Lawrence et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR18"">2011</A></SPAN>), which is the land component of the Community Earth System Model 1 (CESM1; Gent et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR9"">2011</A></SPAN>).</P><P id=""Par11"" class=""Para"">LISSS enhances the Hostetler model by (1) providing a comprehensive treatment of snow including grain size changes with aging and the effects of aerosol deposition on albedo (Flanner et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR7"">2007</A></SPAN>), (2) explicitly simulating freezing, melting, and ice physics, (3) including a sediment thermal submodel, (4) improving the parameterization of lake surface properties such as roughness lengths, and (5) improving the simulation of density-driven mixing events. LISSS solves the 1D thermal diffusion equation for lake water and ice, overlying snow (when present), and underlying substrate, then simulates vertical mixing caused by wind-driven eddies, convection, molecular diffusion, and unresolved 3D mixing processes (following Fang and Stefan <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR5"">1996</A></SPAN>). Atmosphere-lake coupling includes momentum transfer based on fetch-limited friction velocity. After balancing energy fluxes and solving the diffusion equations, LISSS performs full or partial mixing of the water column based on density of adjacent layers. Total lake volume is considered fixed, lateral inflows and outflows are not explicit, and volume changes from direct precipitation, melting snow, and evaporation are immediately balanced as outflows. As implemented in this study, the model includes 25 lake layers, 15 ground layers, and up to 5 snow layers. LISSS has been shown to provide an accurate representation of water temperature and surface fluxes at three small temperate and boreal lakes where extensive observational data was available and also performed well at predicting water temperature and/or ice and snow thicknesses for ten other lakes where less comprehensive forcing observations were available (Subin et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR35"">2012</A></SPAN>).</P><P id=""Par12"" class=""Para"">LISSS is written as a FORTRAN90 module embedded within the larger CLM4 and uses routines from many other parts of CLM4. It is also designed to receive energy and mass forcings from the CESM1. We revised the code to operate in a standalone mode with forcing by user-specified meteorological time series. Code performance was verified by comparison to results of test cases reported by Subin et al.

Changes in average surface water temperatures are closely tied to changes in annual air temperature with similar increases for all baseline <mark>climate</mark>s (Figure <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#MOESM1"">S-3</A></SPAN>). The ratio of change in water temperature to change in air temperature is 77 %, consistent with Schmid et al. (<SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR31"">2014</A></SPAN>). In contrast, hypolimnetic temperature responds to a variety of complex interactions influenced by lake archetype characteristics (Fig. <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Fig1"">1</A></SPAN>; see also Table <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#MOESM1"">S-11</A></SPAN>). Unlike surface temperature, hypolimnetic temperature responds to a complex interaction between energy exchanges and stratification. Total thermal inputs increase, but so does resistance to mixing. When and at what depth the thermocline develops and the depth of light penetration relative to the thermocline influence hypolimnetic temperature. Lake bottom water temperature declines with increased depth, increases with increasing water clarity (which lets more light penetrate to the bottom), and decreases with fetch.</P><DIV id=""Par18"" class=""Para"">Simulated future changes in summer average bottom water temperature are correlated with the current bottom water temperature, which integrates the effects of lake geometry (Fig. <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Fig2"">2a</A></SPAN>). Lakes that show relatively small changes in bottom temperature are those that are deeper and have significant ice cover with winter bottom temperatures that are stable near the maximum density of water just below 4 °C. Changes in average bottom temperature vary strongly with lake depth and Secchi depth or transparency. The average increase in summer bottom temperature per change in annual average air temperature for shallow lakes (maximum depth 4 m) is 76 %, while the ratio for deep lakes (maximum depth 24 m) is 37 %. The change in average integrated water temperature is 26–36 % of change in average air temperature for lakes that maintain significant amounts of ice cover and 62–83 % for lakes that do not. Summer average hypolimnetic temperature can be predicted as a function of annual average air temperature and a composite variable (the ratio of depth to Secchi depth times the square root of depth) that appears to index the joint effects of depth of light penetration and depth-related resistance to mixing, with residual noise due to differences between sites and weather scenarios in wind stress, solar radiation input, and relative humidity (Fig. <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Fig2"">2b</A></SPAN>).<FIGURE class=""Figure"" id=""Fig2""><DIV class=""MediaObject"" id=""MO2""><A href=""https://media.springernature.com/original/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10584-015-1326-1/MediaObjects/10584_2015_1326_Fig2_HTML.gif"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><SPAN class=""u-screenreader-only"">Open image in new window</SPAN></A></DIV><FIGCAPTION class=""Caption"" lang=""en""><DIV class=""CaptionContent""><SPAN class=""CaptionNumber"">Fig. 2</SPAN><P class=""SimplePara"">Summer bottom water temperature: <STRONG class=""EmphasisTypeBold "">a</STRONG> Ratio of change in future bottom water temperature (ΔT<SUB>bot</SUB>) to change in annual average air temperature (ΔT<SUB>air</SUB>) relative to existing bottom temperature (T<SUB>bot,0</SUB>) and lake maximum depth; <STRONG class=""EmphasisTypeBold "">b</STRONG> summer bottom water temperature as a function of average annual air temperature and the ratio of lake depth to Secchi depth times the square root of lake depth (D<SUP>1.5</SUP>/SD)</P></DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><P id=""Par19"" class=""Para"">We investigate the correlation of projected water temperature to lake archetype and <mark>climate</mark> forcing variables through the use of analysis of variance, Pearson correlation, and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) in the <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Sec11"">online supplement</A></SPAN>.

Projected changes by the mid-21st century (Figure <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#MOESM1"">S-4</A></SPAN>) include a reduction in ice cover at these locations averaging 20–30 days per year, with an average of up to 41 days per year for some scenarios at the New Hampshire site. Despite these large changes, all four of the cold-weather sites remain ice covered for more than 70 days per year at mid-century. The majority of the changes by mid-century are projected to occur in the spring, with ice in delayed about a week, but ice out occurring two to four weeks earlier. Lake archetype plays an important role in influencing the baseline length of ice coverage but has only a small influence (less than 1 day) in the differential response to <mark>climate change</mark> scenarios.</P><P id=""Par23"" class=""Para"">Average ice thickness on days when ice is present is also projected to decrease, as does the projected thickness of snow on top of ice, allowing greater light penetration.

Stratification strength is summarized via the one-dimensional analogue of Schmidt stability (J/m<SUP>2</SUP>; Idso <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR13"">1973</A></SPAN>). Schmidt stability is a measure of the energy required to mix the water column and thus varies strongly with depth (model average of 400 J/m<SUP>2</SUP> at 4 m depth to 45.470 J/m<SUP>2</SUP> at 24 m depth under current <mark>climate</mark>; Table <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Tab1"">1</A></SPAN>). Changes in stability vary by location and lake archetype, with larger increases in deeper and more turbid lakes; however, the percentage changes is relatively consistent across depth classes (mean 18.9 %, standard deviation 8.0 %; see Table <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Tab1"">1</A></SPAN>). The open water stratification ratio, defined as the fraction of time when the surface layer temperature is more than 1 °C greater than the bottom layer temperature, also increases at most stations. As discussed in the <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Sec11"">online supplemen</A></SPAN>t, increases in air temperature and insolation are positively correlated with increases in stratification.

</P><P>On Monday, Johnson used his <A href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/9814618/Its-snowing-and-it-really-feels-like-the-start-of-a-mini-ice-age.html"" target=""_blank""><EM>Telegraph</EM> column</A> to muse on the global climatic implications of a few days of wintry weather in the UK in January. He concluded that it might be time for policy-makers to consider whether the earth is heading for a &quot;mini Ice Age&quot;.</P><P>This is complete rubbish, of course, and shows not only that Johnson does not understand the basic science behind global warming but also that he cannot distinguish between anecdote and evidence, or between weather and <mark>climate</mark>.
</P><P>Claiming to be &quot;an empiricist&quot;, Johnson suggested that this is &quot;the fifth year in a row that we have had an unusual amount of snow&quot; and that &quot;I don’t remember winters like this&quot;. Unfortunately, his commitment to observational analysis apparently does not extend to consulting <A href=""http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/<mark>climate</mark>/uk/datasets/Tmean/ranked/UK.txt"" target=""_blank"">the Met Office’s records</A>, which would have shown him that although the average temperatures in the UK during winters 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11 were below average, last winter was actually warmer than average, as were most winters since 2000.
</P><P>Furthermore, he would have discovered that the UK’s <mark>climate</mark> bears the unmistakeable footprint of global warming, with the seven warmest years on record all occurring since 2000. So why does the Mayor claim we are experiencing global cooling?</P><P>Well, it seems that the only person Johnson consults on this issue is his friend Piers Corbyn, who rejects the overwhelming evidence that rising atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases is driving the unambiguous rise in global average temperatures, and instead holds the sun directly responsible for trends in the Earth’s <mark>climate</mark>.
</P><P>The trouble with Dr Corbyn’s theory, which he has not published in any peer-reviewed scientific journal, is that it is not supported by evidence. He does not even believe that the earth’s <mark>climate</mark> is controlled by the amount of energy radiated from the sun, but instead blames its magnetic activity, which increases and decreases cyclically about every 11 years and so clearly <A href=""http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/719139main_2012_GISTEMP_summary.pdf"" target=""_blank"">cannot be the main driver</A> of global warming.
</P><P>Johnson’s description of Dr Corbyn’s theory is an almost verbatim reproduction from <A href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/9402260/To-avoid-the-Olympic-weather-forecast-please-look-away-now.html"" target=""_blank"">one of his earlier columns</A> last July (clearly the £250,000 he is allegedly paid each year is not high enough to guarantee original content for its readers), and is punctuated with references to JMW Turner, Shakespeare and the Aztecs, but largely devoid of scientific insight.</P><P>This latest gaffe follows his decision last year to invite Matt Ridley, a prominent <mark>climate change</mark> ‘sceptic’ and former chairman of Northern Rock, to <A href=""http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/why-boris-johnson-promoting-<mark>climate</mark>-change-sceptics"">speak at City Hall</A> about how environmental risks are overblown, as part of the cultural celebration that accompanied the Olympics.</P><P>Perhaps we should not be surprised by all this given the complete lack of scientific education that Johnson has received. However, the Mayor has to take scientific evidence and expert knowledge into account when making many important decisions, not the least of which is how to adapt the capital’s transport system and infrastructure to withstand the impacts of global warming. He should not be relying on the fanciful theories of friends when it comes to issues that affect the lives and livelihoods of Londoners.
</P><P>Johnson should make better use of the fact that the capital is home to many world class universities and scientific societies where he could consult genuine experts, most of whom now cringe every time he holds forth about <mark>climate change</mark>. But it is also time that the Mayor of London followed the example of central government departments by adding a professional and credible chief scientific adviser to his team.

We found that a larger area of Africa currently experiences the ideal temperature for transmission than previously supposed. Under future <mark>climate</mark> projections, we predicted a modest increase in the overall area suitable for malaria transmission, but a net decrease in the most suitable area. Combined with human population density projections, our maps suggest that areas with temperatures suitable for year-round, highest-risk transmission will shift from coastal West Africa to the Albertine Rift between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, whereas areas with seasonal transmission suitability will shift toward sub-Saharan coastal areas. Mapping temperature suitability places important bounds on malaria transmissibility and, along with local level demographic, socioeconomic, and ecological factors, can indicate where resources may be best spent on malaria control.</P></DIV><DIV class=""sec""><STRONG class=""kwd-title""><STRONG>Key Words:</STRONG>: </STRONG><SPAN class=""kwd-text"">Malaria, <mark>Climate change</mark>, Physiological response, Africa</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""s001"" class=""tsec sec""><H2 class=""head no_bottom_margin"" id=""s001title"">Introduction</H2><P id=""__p2"" class=""p p-first"">M<SPAN class=""small-caps"">alaria causes an estimated</SPAN> 584,000 deaths a year, mostly due to <EM>Plasmodium falciparum</EM> and mostly in sub-Saharan Africa (World Health Organization <A href=""#B44"" rid=""B44"" class="" bibr popnode"">2014</A>). This substantial health burden is anticipated to increase with changing <mark>climate</mark> (Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> <A href=""#B19"" rid=""B19"" class="" bibr popnode"">2007a</A>, Shuman <A href=""#B38"" rid=""B38"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502585005"">2010</A>, Parham et al. <A href=""#B31"" rid=""B31"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502584969"">2015</A> and references therein). Many factors impact malaria burden, including <mark>climate</mark>, land use, socioeconomic conditions, and intervention efforts (Johnson et al. <A href=""#B22"" rid=""B22"" class="" bibr popnode"">2014</A>). In particular, the temperature sensitivity of mosquitoes and parasites limits the transmission potential in a given location, and temperature has been shown to be an important predictor of malaria incidence in many areas (Pascual et al. <A href=""#B32"" rid=""B32"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502585003"">2006</A>). Because insect and parasite physiology constrain malaria transmission to temperatures between 17°C and 34°C (Mordecai et al. <A href=""#B27"" rid=""B27"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502584980"">2013</A>), temperature places limits on the spatial and temporal distribution of malaria transmission. <mark>Climate</mark>-induced shifts in distribution will impact the efficacy of intervention and vector control efforts (Siraj et al. <A href=""#B39"" rid=""B39"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502584975"">2014</A>). As a result, accurately modeling how temperature limits transmission is essential to our understanding of the current and future distribution of malaria on the landscape (Snow et al. <A href=""#B40"" rid=""B40"" class="" bibr popnode"">1996</A>).</P><P id=""__p3"">Control measures can interrupt malaria transmission where <mark>climate</mark> conditions are suitable (Gething et al. <A href=""#B12"" rid=""B12"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502584997"">2010</A>), making it difficult to predict <mark>climate</mark> suitability for transmission using statistical models of observed malaria transmission (human case data). An alternative is to use physiological (or process-based) models of transmission that explicitly link environmental drivers, in this case temperature, with transmission potential, to build maps of suitability.

(<A href=""#B27"" rid=""B27"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502585000"">2013</A>) proposed a physiological model to assess the range of temperatures most suitable for malaria transmission. Specifically, the model incorporated the thermal ecology of anopheline mosquitoes (particularly <EM>Anopheles gambiae</EM>, the major vector of malaria in Africa) and <EM>P. falciparum,</EM> the major malaria parasite. This model included biologically relevant unimodal physiological responses of all entomological and parasite life history traits to temperature, derived from empirical data. Including these explicit thermal responses reduced the predicted optimal temperature for malaria transmission by 6°C from previous model estimates—from 31°C to 25°C. Additionally, the predicted lower bounds for transmission decreased from around 20°C to 17°C, and the upper bounds decreased from 40°C to 34°C (Mordecai et al. <A href=""#B27"" rid=""B27"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502584995"">2013</A>).

In contrast, our 100% range map of suitability predicts a much larger area of 12-month suitability, because it captures all areas where malaria transmission is not excluded for a full 12 months. Our map predictions differ from the MARA map in several regions, specifically in the Horn of Africa and in southern Africa; we find suitability where it is not predicted by MARA. These differences almost certainly reflect factors other than temperature, including different assumptions about humidity. In the MARA model specifications, full suitability in southern Africa (<EM>i.e</EM>., south of 8° latitude) was only achieved if an area experienced temperatures above 6°C and 80mm or more of rain for at least 5 months (Guerra <A href=""#B15"" rid=""B15"" class="" bibr popnode"">2007</A>), a strict multivariate limit. This limit is used to focus MARA maps on endemic malaria areas, which is only a subset of what we considered.</P><P id=""__p26"">Other recent maps that focus specifically on areas in Africa suitable for epidemic (episodic) malaria (Grover-Kopec et al. <A href=""#B14"" rid=""B14"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502584994"">2005</A>) match well with our predicted areas of lower transmission (lower suitability, short season). Our current predictions (<A href=""/pmc/articles/PMC4700390/figure/f2/"" target=""figure"" class=""fig-table-link fig figpopup"" rid-figpopup=""f2"" rid-ob=""ob-f2"" co-legend-rid=""lgnd_f2""><SPAN>Fig. 2a</SPAN></A>) correspond broadly with current <EM>P. falciparum</EM> parasite prevalence measured in children ages 2–10 (see <A href=""/pmc/articles/PMC4700390/figure/f2/"" target=""figure"" class=""fig-table-link fig figpopup"" rid-figpopup=""f2"" rid-ob=""ob-f2"" co-legend-rid=""lgnd_f2""><SPAN>Fig. 2</SPAN></A> in Noor et al. <A href=""#B28"" rid=""B28"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502584983"">2014</A>). A temperature-only suitability map based only on the duration of sporogony for <EM>P. falciparum</EM>, developed by Guerra (<A href=""#B15"" rid=""B15"" class="" bibr popnode"">2007</A>) as a step in a larger modeling process indicates that all of Africa could potentially be suitable for the malaria parasite (see Fig. 6.6 in Guerra <A href=""#B15"" rid=""B15"" class="" bibr popnode"">2007</A>), in line with our “marginally suitable” or largest range limit. Our model also broadly corroborates predictions of current and future <EM>A. gambiae</EM> range in Africa using an ecological niche model (Peterson <A href=""#B33"" rid=""B33"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502584988"">2009</A>). Because each malaria or vector mapping project discussed used slightly different criteria, we cannot expect these maps to correspond exactly. Other approaches, such as those that rely on empirical transmission data, could inadequately capture conditions that influence transmission in areas with human populations that are too small to sustain malaria or where data collection effort is too low to capture intermittent transmission. The challenges in understanding why each approach results in different predicted patterns highlight the need to make the mapping process more transparent across studies so they can be compared more directly (Johnson et al. <A href=""#B22"" rid=""B22"" class="" bibr popnode"">2014</A>).</P><P id=""__p27"">Our maps suggest that projected <mark>climate change</mark> could lead to a large decrease in the population at highest risk for malaria transmission. Future shifts in population density will affect the distribution of people living where temperatures are suitable for malaria transmission, and this distribution might also respond directly to changes in <mark>climate</mark> or malaria transmission. However, we emphasize that the Mordecai et al. (<A href=""#B27"" rid=""B27"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502584985"">2013</A>) model predicts that optimum transmission temperatures are cooler than in previous models. Given the predicted geographic shifts of these moderate temperatures, it is likely that the optimal transmission temperature and high population density will continue to coincide. Finally, our predicted transmission suitability under <mark>climate change</mark> is limited to the predictive quality of the <mark>climate</mark> model we use; understanding the importance of assumptions underlying <mark>climate change</mark> scenarios would require repeating the analyses described here under different <mark>climate</mark> regimes.</P><P id=""__p28"">We still need a better understanding of the behavior and physiology of local mosquito and parasite populations and their <mark>climate</mark> space. One thermal performance curve cannot capture the full breadth of thermal response behavior of all mosquito and parasite populations across Africa. Ectothermic populations differ in their responses to temperature within species, due to adaptation of local populations to prevailing local conditions (Angilletta et al. <A href=""#B2"" rid=""B2"" class="" bibr popnode"">2002</A>), which may affect their capability to cope with climatic change (Sternberg and Thomas <A href=""#B41"" rid=""B41"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502584972"">2014</A>). Moreover, the actual temperatures that vectors and parasites experience can differ considerably from standard weather station data (Cator et al. <A href=""#B9"" rid=""B9"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502584966"">2013</A>), in part because mosquitoes can thermoregulate behaviorally (Blanford et al. <A href=""#B8"" rid=""B8"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502584978"">2009</A>) and avoid extreme temperatures (Kirby and Lindsay <A href=""#B23"" rid=""B23"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502584990"">2004</A>). Temperature variation (<EM>e.g</EM>., daily temperature variation) may also be important for making more accurate local predictions, but we do not expect it to affect our general predictions for relative suitability. While daily fluctuations have been shown to affect mosquito and parasite development (Paaijmans et al. <A href=""#B29"" rid=""B29"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502584970"">2010</A>), this occurs mostly at the tails (upper and lower boundaries) of the range. Blanford et al. (<A href=""#B7"" rid=""B7"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502584973"">2013</A>) found that these temperature variations averaged over a month performed just as well as daily fluctuations for estimating biological rates. Nonetheless, local studies on mosquito physiology and behavior, combined with microclimatic measurements, will allow us to determine how <mark>climate</mark>, <mark>climate</mark> variability, and <mark>climate</mark> extremes eventually affect disease transmission at a finer scale (Altizer et al. <A href=""#B1"" rid=""B1"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502585004"">2013</A>).</P><P id=""__p29"">Our approach focuses on determining how temperature impacts broad geographic patterns of malaria transmission potential. Spatial regression models incorporating many other environmental and socioeconomic covariates, such as atmospheric humidity, rainfall, or bed-net availability, could further enhance predictions at a local scale. Our model assesses the direct influence of temperature on transmission mechanistically. Thus, our results complement statistical models derived from field data to inform why malaria is excluded in some regions and highly prevalent in others. It can also serve as a baseline for predicting future suitability, as mechanistic models are useful for predicting outside the range of current data than traditional regression-based approaches (Rogers and Randolph <A href=""#B36"" rid=""B36"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502584989"">2006</A>, Bayarri et al. <A href=""#B5"" rid=""B5"" class="" bibr popnode"">2009</A>). This framework allows us to disentangle the effects of other important factors, such as land use and disease control efforts (Gething et al. <A href=""#B12"" rid=""B12"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_502585008"">2010</A>), to better predict transmission risk in the field.</P><P id=""__p30"" class=""p p-last"">We note that the timescale at which <mark>climate change</mark> may affect the distribution of suitability does not necessarily match that of health intervention planning. However, this suitability map can inform current allocation of intervention under current <mark>climate</mark> conditions by highlighting areas that perhaps were not previously identified as seasonally suitable or by distinguishing endemic suitability and epidemic suitability. Given that the types of intervention and control differ in these contrasting scenarios, and that resistance can emerge in more episodic areas, we think this map is of value to planning. Most importantly, with accurate suitability predictions and appropriate planning for potential geographic shifts in risk, an increase in transmission suitability does not have to increase malaria cases.</P></DIV><DIV id=""__sec1"" class=""tsec sec""><H2 class=""head no_bottom_margin"" id=""__sec1title"">Supplementary Material</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Los compromisos incluyen la reducción de las emisiones en las operaciones y las cadenas productivas, con miras a usar energía renovable.</P><P>“Este grupo, conformado por 5 compañías, es el responsable de la reducción de una cuarta parte de las 100 millones de toneladas de <mark>CO2</mark>, como parte del programa global <mark>Climate</mark> Savers, el cual fue establecido desde 1999,” mencionó Matt Banks, Director de Energía y Clima de WWF. &quot;Estamos hablando de empresas que están en la línea de batalla en la lucha contra el cambio climático, y quienes desbloquearán los costos asociados con los beneficios de reducir las emisiones.”</P><P>El programa <mark>Climate</mark> Savers es la plataforma global de WWF que tiene como objetivo motivar a las empresas y la industria en temas relacionados con clima y energía. Las empresas participantes - que ahora suman 30 – se comprometen a convertirse en los mejores en su clase en la reducción de las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero (GEI), y se comprometen también a influir en la evolución de los mercados y las políticas, promoviendo su visión, soluciones y logros. Hasta hoy, las compañías que forman parte de <mark>Climate</mark> Savers han reducido sus emisiones de <mark>CO2</mark> en unas 100 millones de toneladas desde 1999, el equivalente a retirar más de 25 millones de automóviles de las carreteras.</P><P>Las metas y declaraciones específicas de los representantes de las compañías incluyen:</P><P><STRONG>Catalyst Paper Corporation</STRONG></P><P>Para 2020, Catalyst Paper Corporation reducirá sus emisiones de GEI 75% respecto a los niveles de 1990.</P><P>&quot;Catalyst Paper opera en la Columbia Británica, una de las relativamente pocas jurisdicciones en el mundo que ha externado la preocupación del costo asociado con las emisiones de GEI por medio de un impuesto provincial de <mark>carbon</mark>o. Nuestra reacción temprana de reducir las emisiones de las fábricas en más de 70% desde 1990 a través de mejoras, el cambio de combustible y la eficiencia de los procesos operativos, nos ayudaron a mitigar estos costos fiscales. Nuestro enfoque en el cambio climático y la conservación está fuertemente alineado con los objetivos del programa <mark>Climate</mark> Savers de WWF, del cual formamos parte desde 2005 y ayuda a diferenciar a Catalyst dentro de un concurrido mercado.”</P><P><EM>- Lyn Brown, Vicepresidente de Marketing y Responsabilidad Corporativa, Catalyst Paper Corporation</EM></P><P><STRONG>The Coca-Cola Company</STRONG></P><P>Para 2020, The Coca-Cola Company, se ha comprometido a reducir la huella de <mark>carbon</mark>o del “refresco en la mano&quot; 25% por debajo de los niveles de 2010.</P><P>&quot;En lo que respecta al cambio climático, ha llegado el momento de hacer algo más que preocuparnos por nosotros mismos.

			This article is part of the series <A href=""http://www.sightline.org/series/flashcards/"">Flashcards</A></DIV><DIV class=""post-content entry-content""><P><EM><STRONG>Editor’s note August 2016: </STRONG> What happens when a scientist picks up a paintbrush? A 2,000-page report is condensed into a beautiful (and concise) work of art. This all-time favorite Sightline article is part poetry, part watercolor, and part powerful <mark>climate change</mark> talking points. You can check out more of Greg’s haikus in this recently released</EM> <A href=""https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/index.cfm/publications/bulletin-of-the-american-meteorological-society-bams/state-of-the-<mark>climate</mark>/"">State of the <mark>Climate</mark></A> <EM>report. Enjoy!</EM></P><P>Reports released by the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) can be daunting, even for science and policy insiders. The full Physical Science Assessment, the first installment of the <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>change2013.org/images/uploads/WGIAR5_WGI-12Doc2b_FinalDraft_All.pdf"">Fifth Assessment Report</A> (pdf), released in manuscript form earlier this year, is over 2,000 pages long.</P><P>And even the <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>change2013.org/"">Summary for Policymakers</A>, rather optimistically referred to as a “brochure,” is a dense 27 pages.</P><P>What if we could communicate the essence of this important information in plain language and pictures? Well, that’s just what one Northwest oceanographer has done. He’s distilled the entire report into 19 illustrated haiku.</P><P>The result is stunning, sobering, and brilliant. It’s poetry. It’s a work of art. But it doubles as clear, concise, powerful talking points and a compelling visual guide.</P><P style=""text-align: left;"">How did it come about? Housebound with a rotten cold one recent weekend, Greg Johnson found himself paring down his key takeaways from the IPCC report into <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku"">haiku</A>. He finds that the constraints of the haiku form help to focus his thoughts (he told me that he posts exclusively in haiku on Facebook, in fact!) and described the process as a sort of meditation. He never intended to share these “IPCC” poems.</P><P>Johnson’s daughter, an artist, inspired him to try his hand at watercolors. On a whim, he illustrated each haiku and shared the results with family and a few friends.</P><P>When I got wind of it, I had to see it. And I’m glad I had the chance. I immediately wanted everybody I know to see it, too!</P><P>Condensing to this degree is not how scientists typically operate. But, as Johnson proves, scientists can also be poets. Still, he’s quick to caution that this is his own unofficial artistic interpretation and that it omits all the quantitative details and the IPCC’s scientific qualifications.</P><P style=""text-align: left;"">Therein lies the beauty: stripped of the jargon and unfathomably large numbers, the limitations and the scales of confidence that confound and distract us laypeople, it is an arresting and informative entree into the science—not, of course, a substitute for the full report.</P><P>We are delighted to share Johnson’s beautiful meditation here (and below as a PDF, DIY booklet, and video slide show for personal or educational nonprofit use). You can also find the entire collection <A href=""http://www.sightline.org/2014/12/23/reporte-completo-del-ipcc-en-19-haikus-ilustrados/"">in Spanish here</A>.</P><P><B>A note from Greg Johnson:</B> This work is an attempt to distill into haiku “The Summary for Policymakers of the Working Group 1 Contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> Fifth Assessment Report.” The result is solely my own creation, so any views or opinions expressed herein are my own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the US Government, the IPCC, or any other entity.</P><P style=""text-align: center;""><A class=""button color-orange"" href=""http://www.sightline.org/series/flashcards/"">Love what you're reading?

Most working meteorologists fall into that camp, says <A href=""http://www.ametsoc.org/amsnews/bios/seitter.html"" target=""_blank"">Keith Seitter</A>, the executive director of the <A href=""http://www.ametsoc.org/"" target=""_blank"">American Meteorological Society</A> (AMS).

The AMS is the nation's largest meteorology membership organization.</P><P>Seitter says most U.S. meteorologists are researchers, such as state climatologists or those who work at NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), universities and nonprofit institutions. About 10 percent are TV weather reporters, he notes.</P><P>They are &quot;unusually skeptical&quot; and &quot;pretty vocal ... [This] has caused some conflict within the AMS.&quot; Some members have dropped their membership because of the society's stance on global warming, Seitter says.</P><P>Experts say one answer to the broadcaster/scientist disparity lies in their different levels of confidence in computer models.</P><P>While the models TV meteorologists use to forecast weather use the same &quot;physics&quot; as those scientists use to predict long-term <mark>climate</mark> trends (for instance, the same calculations for how the atmosphere and biosphere interact), the data they plug into them is quite different, explains <A href=""http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/keith-dixon-homepage"" target=""_blank"">Keith Dixon</A>, a research meteorologist at NOAA, who focuses on <mark>climate</mark> variability.</P><P>Just using different data produces scenarios with vastly different accuracies, he says.</P><P>TV meteorologists generally plug in very localized parameters like current wind speed and sea surface temperatures, which provide clues to rainfall and cloud formation in the immediate future, in a particular area.</P><P>Weather models are usually only accurate in predicting five- or seven-day forecasts—if that. A common belief of broadcasters is that <mark>climate</mark> models are just as fallible.</P><P>&quot;The forecasters live in the real world. They know models in general, and they know these models don't even get tomorrow right,&quot; says <A href=""http://icecap.us/index.php/go/experts"" target=""_blank"">Joseph D'Aleo</A>, a well-known <mark>climate</mark> skeptic and the first director of meteorology at The Weather Channel. &quot;They aren't going to trust them to be right about what is going to happen in 2100.&quot; Polls show that a vast majority of weathercasters, about 75 percent, distrust models of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>But Dixon says that mistrust isn't warranted.</P><P>He explains that <mark>climate</mark> scientists crunch different data that plays a large role in determining long-term <mark>climate</mark> variability, such as the movement of heat within the oceans or the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface. &quot;We're making projections about the overall <mark>climate</mark>,&quot; Dixon says, and that bigger-picture data is what makes long-term predictions so accurate. Plug in current wind speed into those models, he suggests, and the accuracy plummets.</P><P>&quot;It's a bit disappointing that this confusion over the models still exists.&quot;</P><P>Seitter of AMS agrees there is a &quot;disconnect&quot; over the models and says it &quot;can be easily fixed.&quot;</P><P>&quot;Simply teaching [broadcast meteorologists] about the differences [between weather and <mark>climate</mark>] models, about how they are essentially the same, but used in different ways, can do a lot to clear up any skepticism.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>State of Meteorology Education</STRONG></P><P>Most research meteorologists have graduate degrees in meteorology or related fields like atmospheric sciences. About half of TV forecasters have bachelor degrees in meteorology, says Maibach of the George Mason University Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Communication. The other half is composed mainly of journalists who were assigned the weather beat.</P><P>Prominent broadcast meteorologists who are skeptical of <mark>climate</mark> science fall into both categories. For instance, <A href=""http://www.kusi.com/story/12963605/john-coleman?clienttype=printable"" target=""_blank"">John Coleman</A>, co-founder of The Weather Channel and weatherman for KUSI-TV in San Diego—who has described global warming as &quot;a fictional, manufactured crisis and a total scam&quot;—has an undergraduate degree in journalism.</P><P>Others, including San Antonio meteorologist <A href=""http://www.kens5.com/on-tv/bios/68670807.html"" target=""_blank"">Bill Taylor</A> and Cleveland forecaster <A href=""http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/about_us/staff/Chief-Meteorologist-Mark-Johnson-biography"" target=""_blank"">Mark Johnson</A>, both vocal <mark>climate</mark> skeptics, started with undergraduate degrees in journalism or related fields like communications and later obtained meteorology certifications from Mississippi State University, a three-year distance learning program. Still others, like <A href=""http://www.kktv.com/station/bios/weather/2080991.html"" target=""_blank"">Brian Bledsoe</A> of KKTV in Colorado and <A href=""http://andrebernier.com/?page_id=2"" target=""_blank"">Andre Bernier</A> of WJW in Cleveland, also both known skeptics, hold undergraduate degrees in meteorology.</P><P>But even if all TV forecasters had degrees in meteorology would it matter? &quot;There are virtually no undergraduate meteorology programs in the country that have a significant climatology component,&quot; says Bud Ward, editor of the <A href=""http://www.yale<mark>climate</mark>mediaforum.org/"" target=""_blank"">Yale Forum on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the Media</A>, part of a Yale <mark>climate</mark> initiative that has recently turned its attention to this issue.</P><P>&quot;You can go through your whole degree without ever having taken a course on <mark>climate</mark>.&quot;</P><P>Even those programs considered top in the nation—such as Penn State and the University of Oklahoma—are only now adding global warming science to their curricula, though they have long taught the fundamentals of how the <mark>climate</mark> system works.</P><P><A href=""http://ploneprod.met.psu.edu/people/whb2"" target=""_blank"">Bill Brune</A>, an atmospheric chemist and head of Penn State's Department of Meteorology, says that students are exposed to concepts of <mark>climate</mark> science in two required classes—a survey course on atmospheric sciences and an upper-level undergraduate course called Radiation and <mark>Climate</mark>.</P><P>&quot;In these and other courses, students are shown the changes in atmospheric composition and their impacts on atmospheric science and <mark>climate</mark>. The words '<mark>climate change</mark>' ... do not necessarily appear on the course descriptions, but they are in the course syllabi or lectures.&quot;</P><P>Brune says changes are afoot. The course <mark>Climate</mark> Dynamics, currently an elective for meteorology students, was approved as a requirement starting next year. The class will cover <mark>climate change</mark> and its human influences, Brune notes.</P><P>Most undergraduate programs, including the University of Oklahoma, have added optional <mark>climate</mark>-related coursework during the past few years, a decision that some experts say could portend an increase in the number of forecasters who accept human-caused <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>D'Aleo, formerly of The Weather Channel and a former professor of meteorology at Lyndon State College of Vermont, says that introducing <mark>climate</mark> science into curricula will bias students against the belief that long-term <mark>climate change</mark> is driven by natural forces.</P><P>&quot;When I was a professor years ago, we taught students how to think, not what to think,&quot; he says.</P><P>AMS and the <A href=""http://www.nwas.org/"" target=""_blank"">National Weather Association</A> (NWA), the other major U.S. professional organization for meteorologists, offer optional broadcast meteorology certification programs. To obtain AMS certification, forecasters have to take courses on a range of topics from atmospheric physics to remote sensing, to pass a written exam and to have their on-air work and forecasts reviewed.</P><P>The AMS doesn't require <mark>climate</mark> science coursework to earn certification. Nor does the society test forecasters' global warming knowledge during the exam. &quot;There is no discussion of changing the requirements to include [<mark>climate change</mark>],&quot; says Seitter of AMS. The certification program is geared toward making sure broadcasters have adequate knowledge of forecasting, &quot;since this is what these guys are getting paid to do.&quot;</P><P>Seitter notes that forecasters are encouraged to take global warming courses on their own.</P><P>To get NWA certification, TV meteorologists similarly have to pass a written exam and have their work critiqued by the society. Applicants are not tested on their <mark>climate change</mark> knowledge.</P><P>Souweine of Forecast the Facts believes the AMS and NWA programs need to change. &quot;A certification for meteorologists that has no requirement for them to be able to speak intelligently and in an informed way about <mark>climate change</mark> seems like an empty certification,&quot; he says.</P><P>Souweine says the campaign plans to put pressure on both societies to require such coursework.</P><P>But whether or how a weathercaster chooses to discuss <mark>climate change</mark> may come down to something harder to influence, says Maibach: their personal politics and beliefs.</P><P>In recent years, <mark>climate change</mark> has become a partisan lighting rod, with the majority of Democrats, about two-thirds, believing that Earth's temperature is rising from human activity, with only one-third of Republicans agreeing with them, say polls. </P><P><A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/20120221/republicans-santorum-romney-gingrich-<mark>climate</mark>-scientists-scientific-consensus-skeptics-kerry-emanuel?page=show"" target=""_blank"">No candidate who was vying for the GOP presidential nomination</A> admitted to the scientific consensus, even if they supported <mark>climate policy</mark> in the past.</P><P>Meteorologists are not immune, says Maibach. &quot;<mark>Climate change</mark> has become so politically polarized that someone's party affiliation is now the dominant lens through which people come to look at the issue—even if they have scientific training.&quot;</P><P>Maibach says he believes that personal politics are so central to views on <mark>climate change</mark> that he is considering asking TV meteorologists to state their party affiliations in upcoming surveys.</P><P><STRONG>Audience Expectations </STRONG></P><P>Weathercasters are often the only people at their stations with scientific backgrounds. As a result, they often engage in on-air chit-chat with news anchors on science issues, including global warming. They also write articles for the station's website and are frequently invited to give guest lectures at schools and various community organizations.</P><P>For many Americans, their TV weatherperson is the only <mark>climate</mark>-related authority they encounter each day.</P><P>&quot;Most Americans are never going to know who the world's major <mark>climate</mark> scientists are, but they know who their weatherperson is,&quot; Souweine says. According to a survey by Maibach and colleagues, more than three-quarters of TV meteorologists say they have discussed the topic of global warming either on or off air.</P><P>The Yale Project on <mark>Climate Change</mark> Communication has hosted workshops across the country that connect TV weathercasters with <mark>climate</mark> scientists. During the day-long event, <mark>climate</mark> scientists discuss the link between <mark>climate change</mark> and weather, address the latest science and help meteorologists understand how global warming will affect their regions. &quot;We go into this realistically,&quot; says Ward, the editor of the forum and workshop organizer. &quot;We know we are not always going to change people's opinions, so that is not our goal. We just want to provide them with accurate information and give them avenues to ask questions.&quot;</P><P>But some, like D'Aleo, who is no longer on the air but runs a website called <A href=""http://www.icecap.us/"" target=""_blank"">ICECAP</A>, which promotes views of <mark>climate</mark> skeptics, say global warming should be off limits to forecasters.</P><P>&quot;It is not our role,&quot; he says. &quot;And in fact, many station managers have told forecasters not to do it, because if you take one side or another it will alienate a percentage of your audience and you might lose them.&quot; In 2010, D'Aleo did an <A href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33JG3mX7KkQ"" target=""_blank"">on-air segment</A> with Coleman in San Diego, in which he accuses <mark>climate</mark> scientists of manipulating temperature data on global warming.</P><P>Souweine of Forecast the Facts says that silence isn't an option. &quot;Viewers do care about this ... They feel it is the job of the news to tell them what is going on, and [<mark>climate change</mark>] is the biggest weather story of the 21st century.</P><P>&quot;When they don't mention <mark>climate change</mark> while reporting on another set of record high temperatures or unprecedented severe weather,&quot; Souweine continues, &quot;it is like a news reporter talking about a string of murders and not mentioning there is a suspect in custody.&quot;</P><P><EM> Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News intern Kathryn Doyle contributed reporting to this story.</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""tagged-with""><LABEL>Published Under:</LABEL></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The programme will represent a turning point in the lives of the women involved, providing them with the tools they need to develop themselves and their activities.</P><P><STRONG>INFORM &amp; RAISE AWARENESS</STRONG>: Highlight the key role women play in the development and championing of <mark>climate</mark> policies. C40 will undertake <STRONG>research</STRONG> to fill the knowledge gap about the interplay between gender, cities and <mark>climate</mark>. The results will be instrumental in helping cities deliver inclusive <mark>climate</mark> action plans.</P><P><STRONG>DRIVE ACTION</STRONG>: Support future <mark>climate</mark> leaders by launching an <STRONG>annual challenge</STRONG> dedicated to awarding women researchers and entrepreneurs on the best <mark>innovation</mark>s in <mark>climate</mark> and sustainability.</P><P><STRONG>INFLUENCE: Achieve visibility and thought leadership </STRONG>to motivate and inspire women around the world to become leaders in business, government and <mark>climate</mark>-focused organizations. We will hold ambitious events to showcase the thought leadership achievements of the Women4<mark>Climate</mark> Initiative, inform the wider conversation around women and <mark>climate</mark> and create a new vocation among future leaders.</P><P>“As women, we know all too well that the powerful often seek to silence our voices when we speak out to protect the most vulnerable in our communities,” said C40 Chair and Mayor of Paris <STRONG>Anne Hidalgo</STRONG>. “We are here today to show that we refuse to be silenced. All around the world, in city halls, corporate boardrooms and on the streets of our cities women are demanding action to protect the planet from the threat of <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>Across the globe women are leading <mark>climate</mark> action. Former UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres, French Minister of Environment Ségolène Royal and Ambassador of France for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Negotiations Laurence Tubiana were the architects of the historic Paris Agreement on <mark>Climate Change</mark>. Women held six of the most influential positions at the COP22 global <mark>climate</mark> talks in Morocco during 2016. Women mayors have been instrumental to implementing the Paris Agreement and their power is growing. The number of C40 cities with women mayors has increased from four to fifteen since 2014.</P><P>“Women leaders were instrumental in securing the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement and women mayors of C40 cities are stepping up to help ensure their nations reach their goals,” said <STRONG>Michael R. Bloomberg, C40 President of the Board and U.N. Secretary General’s Special Envoy for Cities and <mark>Climate Change</mark></STRONG>. “Women leaders at companies and non-profits are also speeding our progress, and I’m glad to say that includes the CEO of Bloomberg Philanthropies, Patti Harris, and the head of our environment program, Antha Williams.”</P><P>“Every week I meet inspiring young women from business, NGOs and politics, who are determined to change the world, said <STRONG>Mayor of Washington D.C., Muriel Bowser</STRONG>. “If our cities and <mark>climate</mark> are in their hands then It makes me very confident for the future.”</P><P>L'Oréal has already communicated their strong will to engage and support C40 in the long-term development of the Women4<mark>Climate</mark> Initiative. “At L’Oréal, we consider it strategic to engage with C40 women mayors to empower the next generation of women leaders in fighting <mark>climate change</mark>,” said <STRONG>Alexandra Palt, L’Oréal Chief Sustainability Officer</STRONG>. “This commitment reflects two of L’Oréal’s major orientations: gender equality and <mark>climate</mark> protection. Women will play a critical role in tackling <mark>climate change</mark>. It is our responsibility to empower and support them.”</P><P>“Women are more likely to work in industries that will be affected by a changing <mark>climate</mark>, such as agriculture,” said <STRONG>Mayor of Durban, Zandile Gumede</STRONG>. “That is why women need to help lead this fight, to ensure that the environment and the future generations are protected.”</P><P>&quot;Mexico City is one of the first cities to incorporate gender equity into its <mark>Climate</mark> Action Program, we have identified 78 actions to reduce the vulnerability of women to <mark>climate change</mark> in the city,&quot; said the <STRONG>Mayor of Mexico City Miguel Ángel Mancera</STRONG>. &quot;The official launch of the Women4<mark>Climate</mark> initiative in Mexico City during the C40 Mayors' Summit was inspiring and a commitment we take with great responsibility.&quot;</P><P>Participants in the Women4<mark>Climate</mark> Conference include the Mayors of Paris, Durban, Cape Town, Caracas and Mexico City. Additional Speakers will include Michael R. Bloomberg, C40 President of the Board and U.N. Secretary General’s Special Envoy for Cities and <mark>Climate Change</mark>; and Amina J. Mohammed, Deputy Secretary General of United Nations.</P><P>The Women4<mark>Climate</mark> Conference has been generously supported by Suez, Johnson &amp; Johnson &amp; L’Oréal.</P><P><STRONG>Notes:</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>About C40 Cities </STRONG></P><P>C40 Cities connects more than 90 of the world’s greatest cities, representing 650+ million people and one quarter of the global economy. Created and led by cities, C40 is focused on tackling <mark>climate change</mark> and driving urban action that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and <mark>climate</mark> risks, while increasing the health, wellbeing and economic opportunities of urban citizens. The current chair of the C40 is Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo; and three-term Mayor of New York City Michael R. Bloomberg serves as President of the Board. C40’s work is made possible by our three strategic funders: Bloomberg Philanthropies, Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), and Realdania.

The former can be addressed with <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation strategies and tactics, while the latter needs to be addressed by adaptation strategies and tactics.  Adapted from<SUP>2</SUP></P><P><B>J&amp;J’s mitigation-focused <mark>climate change</mark> strategy: High-risk, low return</B>In 2015, J&amp;J revealed that it failed to meet 30% of the goals outlined in its 2010 “Healthy Future” <mark>climate change</mark> commitment.<SUP>1,4</SUP> Shaun Mickus (Executive Director of Corporate Citizenship), seemed to dismiss these results, noting “…that’s OK because a lot of these goals were very much stretch goals.”<SUP>1</SUP>This performance, along with J&amp;J’s conspicuous absence from the UN’s database of actions on <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation, is evidence of an ineffective <mark>climate change</mark> strategy.<SUP>6</SUP>In contrast, J&amp;J’s competitors have adopted broad and proactive strategies, focused on mitigation and adaptation.Bayer is working to develop treatments for diseases carried by insect vectors thought to increase with rising temperatures.<SUP>7</SUP>Other multinational competitors, including Unilever, Novartis and Pfizer have initiated similar strategies.<SUP>7,6</SUP>Thus far, J&amp;J has responded by setting additional internal waste reduction goals – an insufficient step forward.<SUP>8</SUP></P><P>Exhibit 2: President Obama outlines the American Business Act on <mark>Climate Change</mark> – a necessary but insufficient first step focused on <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation (but not adaptation).</P><P><B>Adaptation-focused <mark>climate change</mark> strategies: An opportunity for J&amp;J to demonstrate its commitment to human health, and strength in <mark>innovation</mark></B>The prestigious medical journal <I>The Lancet</I> recently concluded that “<mark>climate change</mark> could be the greatest health opportunity of the 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century.”<SUP>2</SUP><mark>Climate change</mark> will lead to a greater prevalence water and vector-borne illnesses, and cardiovascular and respiratory conditions.<SUP>9</SUP>This will increase demand for healthcare services, vaccines and drugs. As a healthcare leader with expertise in drug development, drug delivery technologies, as well as chemical and materials manufacturing, J&amp;J is uniquely positioned to develop a comprehensive plan to address the direct impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on human health.A <mark>climate change</mark> initiative that includes adaptation strategies and tactics would help the company address this opportunity, and truly “help billions of people live longer, healthier, happier lives today, and for generations to come.”<SUP>4</SUP></P><P><B>Charting a path forward: Getting J&amp;J’s <mark>climate change</mark> strategy on track</B><B><I>
Stage 1: Adopt a broader <mark>climate change</mark> policy and partner with early-movers</I></B>In the near term, J&amp;J should recognize current thinking in <mark>climate change</mark> research and adopt a <mark>climate change</mark> policy that places equal weight on <I>mitigation</I> and <I>adaptation</I>. As a goal, J&amp;J should partner with other healthcare organizations (e.g. universities or non-profits) that have made inroads in developing a comprehensive <mark>climate change</mark> strategy, including prioritizing relevant unmet medical needs that need to be addressed through current and future <mark>innovation</mark>s.</P><P><B><I>Stage 2: Prioritize and invest in products that facilitate <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation</I></B>In collaboration with partner(s) developed as part of stage 1, J&amp;J should optimize its R&amp;D pipeline to anticipate and address current and future medical needs triggered by <mark>climate change</mark>. As a goal, J&amp;J should establish a pipeline of relevant products that anticipate future unmet medical needs, so that they can provide maximal benefit when commercialized.<B>
In hot water: Playing devil’s advocate</B>Critics of the above argument and proposed action plan may argue corporations have no legal, social or fiduciary responsibility to tackle the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on health. As noted above, however, J&amp;J’s competitors disagree. <mark>Climate change</mark> will ultimately need to be addressed by corporations, governments and non-profit organizations.<SUP>7</SUP> The corporations that are most proactive in addressing <mark>climate change</mark> are likely to secure economic benefits from relationships developed between such stakeholders. These corporations are also likely to be rewarded by customers, regulators and shareholders. As a healthcare leader and a good corporate citizen, J&amp;J cannot afford to allow its competitors to gain an advantage in addressing one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity.</P><P>(Word Count: 799)<STRONG>

Together, the completed projects collectively avoided CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions of approximately 248,000 metric tons per year, which is equivalent<SUP>9</SUP> to removing approximately 52,300 cars from the road, and saved approximately 50.0 million gallons of water annually. To date, the energy reduction projects completed since 2005 have cost approximately $370.2 million, and have reduced our annual energy costs by approximately $69 million through 2016. </P><DIV class=""ArticleEnhancement ArticleEnhancement-align-middle ArticleEnhancement-width-m""><DIV class=""ImageEnhancement"" data-jnj-imageenhancement="""" data-align=""middle""><DIV class=""ImageEnhancement-wrapper"" itemprop=""associatedMedia"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/MediaObject""><SPAN class=""ImageEnhancement-expand"">expand</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""ArticleEnhancement ArticleEnhancement-align-middle ArticleEnhancement-width-m""><DIV class=""ImageEnhancement"" data-jnj-imageenhancement="""" data-align=""middle""><DIV class=""ImageEnhancement-wrapper"" itemprop=""associatedMedia"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/MediaObject""><SPAN class=""ImageEnhancement-expand"">expand</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>More than 99.97 percent<SUP>10 </SUP>of the over-the-road transport providers in our U.S. network were members of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s <A href=""https://www.epa.gov/smartway"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-ai=""0"">SmartWay program</A> in 2016.

Base year is 2010, included in table. Emissions in base year have been recalculated to adjust for acquisitions and divestitures in accordance with guidance from World Resources Institute Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, which we follow. Electricity emission factors are obtained from the International Energy Agency’s CO</SUP><SUB>2</SUB><SUP> Emissions from Fuel Combustion Report and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s eGRID publication.

The truth was the smoke was steam, but I still marveled at the connection my son had just made between the health of people and the health of the planet. This made me wonder, if more people saw this connection, would we, as a society, do more to care for the planet, including our <mark>climate</mark>? Would more people take action to lower their own <mark>carbon</mark> footprint? Would there be more demand for things like renewable energy?</P><P>At Johnson &amp; Johnson, we believe the health of people and the health of the planet are inextricably linked and that a changing <mark>climate</mark> resulting in extreme weather, droughts, floods, air <mark>pollution</mark> and vector-borne diseases will ultimately impact human health and wellbeing. And, we’re not the only ones. The <A href=""http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/programs/geh/<mark>climate</mark>change/"" target=""_blank"">National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</A>, the <A href=""http://www.cdc.gov/<mark>climate</mark>andhealth/effects/default.htm"" target=""_blank"">Center for Disease Control</A> and the <A href=""https://www3.epa.gov/<mark>climate</mark>change/impacts/health.html"" target=""_blank"">US Environmental Protection Agency</A> all have websites dedicated to the human health effects of <mark>climate change</mark>. The World Health Organization even went so far as to declare <mark>climate change</mark> as one of the <A href=""http://www.who.int/globalchange/mediacentre/news/global-programme/en/"" target=""_blank"">greatest threats</A> to global health in the 21st century.</P><P>As the world’s most broadly based healthcare company, this challenge inspires us to advocate and create demand for a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy. We do this not only through our efforts to reduce the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of our own facilities, but also by <STRONG>influencing our extended supply chain</STRONG> and collaborating with like-minded organizations.  </P><P>Johnson &amp; Johnson has had a formal energy management program for over 30 years. For more than a decade, we’ve been building clean and renewable energy systems on our properties – from cogeneration to solar, wind and geothermal – establishing our energy program from the ground up. We’ve significantly invested in over 70 renewable energy projects at our facilities, which today, equate to 7% of our global electricity usage.</P><P>Realizing we needed to pick up the pace to meet our goal of powering our facilities with 20 percent renewable energy by 2020, we shifted gears and accelerated our progress by complementing our “build” strategy with a “buy” strategy. This approach resulted in the latest milestone in our clean energy journey of executing a long-term power purchase agreement with E.ON <mark>Climate</mark> and Renewables from their new 200MW wind farm in Texas. Johnson &amp; Johnson has contracted usage of 100MW, which will generate electricity equivalent to 50% of our consumption in the U.S..</P><P>This will equate to an approximate <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide savings of more than 3.7 million metric tons over the next 12 years, helping to meet our 2020 goal four years earlier than anticipated. In the spirit of continuing to pick up the pace, we have decided to <STRONG>increase our goal another 15% to producing or procuring 35% of our global electricity needs from renewable sources by the end of 2020</STRONG>.</P><P>Beyond our four walls, there’s also work to be done. We know that our actions are one ripple in a large ocean. We need to work together with our suppliers and other organizations to <STRONG>turn that ripple into a tsunami of demand for renewable energy</STRONG>. This is why we’ve participated in the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project (CDP) and the CDP Supply Chain Program since its launch. This is why we partnered with the World Wildlife Fund, the World Resources Institute and an alliance that has grown to 51 corporations to launch the <A href=""http://buyersprinciples.org/"" target=""_blank"">Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers Principles</A>.</P><P>And, it is why we joined RE100 – a global campaign that brings together the world’s most influential companies – and made public our aspirations to achieve 100% renewable power and a science-based target of 80% reduction in <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by 2050. <STRONG>Joining this collaborative is one of the most impactful steps corporations can take to amplify their voice and the demand signal for renewable energy</STRONG> – no matter the size of the corporation.</P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> is a big problem that requires big solutions. No one person, no one company, no one government can do it alone. Instead, we must continue to create a global movement of people, companies and organizations all working together to care for our <mark>climate</mark> like our health depends on it. Because it does. Even a five-year-old knows that.  </P><UL><LI><EM>Originally published in the USA Today Special Supplement - <A href=""http://onlinestore.usatoday.com/national-geographic---<mark>climate</mark>-change-p18433.aspx"">National Geographic - <mark>Climate Change</mark>: Are We Too Late?</A>, on September 19, 2016. </EM> </LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-block pane-widgets-s-socialmedia-tcg-grey""><DIV class=""pane-title"">

Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson has waffled quite a bit on the <mark>climate change</mark> issue, finally settling on a pretty hilarious stance: there’s no real reason to spend government resources on trying to slow global warming because eventually, the earth will be enveloped by the white-hot heat of the expanding sun.</P><P>He’s not wrong, he’s just forgetting a few billion years of possible human habitation time between then and now.</P><P>The sun expanding as it grows into a red giant in its natural lifespan of a star is something that will eventually affect the earth and any of its unfortunate inhabitants, but scientists say that won’t happen for another five billion years. Considering that our planet is only about four and a half billion years old, and that humans have only inhabited the earth for about 200,000 years, another five billion years is a whole lot to work with.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>These reports originated with comments Johnson made back on 11 August 2011 during an appearance at a National Press Club luncheon.  When Johnson, a former two-term governor of New Mexico, was asked by moderator Mark Hamrick about how he viewed the issue of <mark>climate change</mark> and what the government’s role in mitigating it should be, he <A href=""http://www.press.org/sites/default/files/20110819_johnson.pdf"" target=""_blank"">responded</A> as follows:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Well, <mark>climate change</mark> — I think the world is getting warmer. I think that it’s man-caused. That said, should we be engaged in cap and trade taxation? No. I don’t think that we should. We should lend certainty to the energy field. We should be  building new coal-fired plants. When you look at the amount of money that we’re looking to spend on global warming, in the trillions, and look at the result, I just argue that the result is completely inconsequential to the money that we would end up
spending, and that we could direct those monies in other ways that would be much more beneficial to mankind.</P><P>We have a long-term view. <STRONG>Should we take the long-term view when it comes to global warming? I think that we should. And the long-term view is that in billions of years, the sun is going to actually grow and encompass the Earth, right. So global warming is in our future</STRONG>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>There’s no question that Johnson said this, but what he <EM>meant</EM> when he said it is debatable.  Although he did suggest that money currently being dedicated to address global warming was being spent ineffectively, he didn’t literally say that we should do nothing about global warming <EM>because</EM> the sun will someday expand and destroy the Earth regardless.</P><P>So what did Johnson mean? His remarks clearly indicate that he believes global warming is anthropogenic (i.e., caused by man) and that he is aware the destruction of the Earth by its sun is billions of years off, so clearly he wasn’t speaking from total scientific ignorance.</P><P>Remarks Johnson made earlier in the luncheon reinforced that he didn’t actually say we should ignore global warming because it’s not not a serious issue and/or because non-anthropogenic warming will kill us all eventually regardless, but rather that some current proposals would involve the expenditure of huge amounts of money to achieve disproportionately small results, and those monies would therefore be better directed elsewhere (i.e., towards different solutions to global warming or in other ways):</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
I happen to believe that global warming is happening, and that it is man-caused. But, that said, what should we do about global warming? Well, I don’t think we should implement cap and trade legislation. And, for the millions of dollars, if not trillions of dollars that we’re looking to tax <mark>carbon</mark> emission, I don’t think it’s going to make a difference at all, long-term. And that those resources could be directed in many more effective ways.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>But still, why did he mention the ultimate destruction of the Earth by the sun billions of years from now? What was his point?  Perhaps his statement was, as some critics content, a flippant, ridiculous, or ignorant justification for not spending much money on global warming and assigning the issue a low priority because it’s an unsolvable problem in the long term.  Or perhaps Johnson was trying to make a point by satirizing those who would defend spending trillions of dollars now on approaches that may do little to ameliorate the problem (rather than waiting for better or most cost-effective solutions), under the guise that they’re taking a “long-term view” — that is, demonstrating  the folly of stretching a “long-term view” to an absurd extreme.</P><P>Which was it?  We can’t say for sure, but given that Johnson asserted the very same thing during the course of an <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKhbc_q5G9Y"" target=""_blank"">interview</A> about environmental issues several months later, we’d have to come down on the side of the former:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
The long-term consequence of our existence in the whole scheme of things is the sun is getting closer to the Earth and that at a point in the very distant future, the sun will actually encompass the Earth. So global warming is something that’s going to be inevitable.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>For what it’s worth, the official Johnson-Weld <A href=""https://www.johnsonweld.com/environment"" target=""_blank"">campaign site</A> reiterates the candidates’ position that global warming is (“probably”) a real and man-made issue, but that government-imposed regulations on the private sector are not an effective means of addressing it:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
When it comes to global <mark>climate change</mark>, Johnson and Weld believe that the politicians in Washington, D.C. are having the wrong debate.</P><P>Is the <mark>climate</mark> changing? Probably so.</P><P>Is man contributing to that change? Probably so.</P><P>But the critical question is whether the politicians’ efforts to regulate, tax and manipulate the private sector are cost-effective — or effective at all. The debate should be about how we can protect our resources and environment for future generations. Governors Johnson and Weld strongly believe that the federal government should prevent future harm by focusing on regulations that protect us from real harm, rather than needlessly costing American jobs and freedom in order to pursue a political agenda.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

Ron Johnson told 27 News Wednesday there's little point to remaining a party to the agreement.   The U.S. joined 194 other nations in signing the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Accord in 2015.</P><P>Under the agreement, each nation will starting taking steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2020 in an attempt to keep temperatures and sea levels from rising.</P><P>But Senator Johnson said the deal is unenforceable and believes it won't produced any real change.</P><P>&quot;I've always questioned, why do we as men with our arrogance - men and women - that we think this is the sweet spot in global <mark>climate</mark> that we've got to spend hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe trillions of dollars trying to maintain this temperature,&quot; said Sen. Johnson.</P><P>A vast majority of <mark>climate</mark> experts believe that if the earth's temperature rises another 3.6 degrees, the planet will be at a point of no return.</P><P>Senator Johnson reiterated a statement he first made on the campaign trail last year, saying he believes mankind will thrive in warmer temperatures.</P><P>The Republican - who defeated Russ Feingold in 2016, a progressive Democrat who supported the Paris accord - said the U.S. would be wise to spend money currently designated to fight <mark>climate change</mark>, on other efforts.</P><P>&quot;I certainly wouldn't want to stay involved in the Paris Accord if it committed American taxpayers to spending a few hundred-billion dollars on something that I think we'd be far better off spending money to alleviate human suffering in other ways - like digging wells, combating malaria, AIDS and those types of things,&quot; said Sen. Johnson.</P><P>Sen.

His academic training in agronomy (B.S.), landscape architecture (MLA) and ecology (Ph.D.) reflect his lifelong passion for learning how to integrate people and their use of the land with native ecosystems and evolutionary processes.  Both his teaching and research focus on the integration of ecology into landscape design, planning and management, with a particular emphasis on conservation planning and ecological restoration through the linkage of innovative design with rigorous research.  This includes applying the conceptual frameworks and analytical techniques of ecology toward design and planning, as well as using the cultural knowledge and approaches of landscape architecture to deepen knowledge of how humans structure ecosystems.  </P><P>His research is collaborative and interdisciplinary.  Current projects focus on the interactions and feedbacks among <mark>climate change</mark>, wildfire, urbanization, rural settlement, endangered ecosystems and land management.  The work integrates techniques and approaches from participatory planning, simulation modeling, manipulative experiments, prescribed fire, and historical vegetation reconstruction.  The ecological context of these studies centers on Pacific Northwest oak savanna, upland prairie and wetland prairie, all imperiled ecosystems.</P><P>In addition to landscape design and planning studios, his courses include Principles of Applied Ecology, <mark>Climate Change</mark> Planning and Design, Landscape Research II, and two intensive field courses, Fire as a Tool for Landscape Design and Management and Reading the Landscape of the High Cascades.</P><P>Dr. Johnson is the UO and international steering committee chair for the <mark>Sustainable</mark> Cities and Landscapes Hub (<A href=""https://apru-scl.uoregon.edu/"">https://apru-scl.uoregon.edu/</A>), an international consortium of 12 universities led by the UO under the auspices of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities (APRU). He was the lead editor of the 2002 book Ecology and Design: Frameworks for Learning, that brought together landscape architects and ecologists to build bridges between the two disciplines . He also was the University of Oregon lead for an international consortium on urban ecology education and has taught ecological design at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. </P><P>He is the recipient of three recent grants from the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy for collaborative, interdisciplinary research on the implications of <mark>climate change</mark> for biodiversity and landscape planning in the Pacific Northwest.</P><P><STRONG>Selected Recent Publications</STRONG></P><P>Mhuireach, G.

That’s the aim of a new effort spearheaded by the U.N.’s recently appointed <A href=""http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/paris-agreement-laurence-tubiana-appointed-as-<mark>climate</mark>-champion/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><mark>climate</mark> champion</A>, French <mark>climate change</mark> ambassador Laurence Tubiana. She hopes to build a system that measures corporate efforts to address <mark>climate change</mark>, with non-governmental organizations playing a role as fact checkers.</P><P>“All sorts of institutions have registered their various commitments,” says Mark Kenber, CEO of The <mark>Climate</mark> Group, an advocacy group that works with dozens of corporations. “Some of those were real commitments and some of those were high level ‘we’ll think about doing something.’ How do we find a common set of methodologies and monitoring, verification and reporting systems so things can be compared?”</P><P>Tubiana, a key figure at the <A href=""http://time.com/4146764/paris-agreement-<mark>climate</mark>-cop-21/"" target=""_blank"">Paris <mark>climate</mark> conference in December</A>, is still determining the form of the future transparency system, but here’s how <mark>climate policy</mark> experts say you should evaluate a corporate <mark>climate</mark> commitment:</P><P><STRONG>1. Support from top executives</STRONG></P><P>Strong <mark>climate</mark> commitments should be approved at a company’s highest levels with consent of the board of directors. Such high-level commitment helps ensure that the company leadership sees addressing global warming as a key part of the corporate strategy and will be less likely to abandon commitments on a whim.</P><P><STRONG>2. Concrete goals</STRONG></P><P>Companies should also make their goals concrete and offer a plausible path to meet them. That means an assessment of where across the supply chain—including in transportation and products purchased from outside vendors—<mark>carbon</mark> emissions come from and a plan to address those specific issues. And, while reasonable goals may only extend a decade or so into the future, companies should have a plan to reassess and strengthen them going forward.</P><P>“Good environmental management is good business management,” says Tom Murray, who runs the corporate partnerships program at the Environmental Defense Fund. “A big part of that is setting big goals and delivering on that.”</P><P><STRONG>3. Transparent reporting</STRONG></P><P>Perhaps most importantly, <mark>climate policy</mark> experts say companies should report on their progress transparently and offer a way for external experts to verify the information. In some ways, outside verification is easy. Top-tier accounting firms like Deloitte and KPMG have developed methods to audit companies’ sustainability efforts. But the audits come with a hefty price tag, and companies are often unwilling to add to their bottom line without a strong business incentive.</P><P><STRONG>Read More</STRONG>: <A href=""http://time.com/4219575/air-<mark>pollution</mark>-deaths/"" target=""_blank"">Air <mark>Pollution</mark> Kills More Than 5 Million People Around the World Every Year</A></P><P>Once a transparency system has been implemented, and companies begin to comply, policy experts will gain a sense of how much progress has been achieved by the private sector toward cutting greenhouse gas emissions. <A href=""http://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/content/private-sector-switch-renewables-could-cut-<mark>co2</mark>-nearly-15”"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">One estimate</A> from the <mark>Climate</mark> Group suggests that a commitment from the world’s 1,000 biggest companies to go 100% renewable would result in a 15% global reduction in <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.

So global warming is in our future.”</P><P>The former New Mexico governor did acknowledge that humans are making the world warmer in the near term, too—but he doesn’t think the government should do much about it. In the same speech, he denounced “<A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/reduce-emissions/cap-trade-<mark>carbon</mark>-tax#.V-LNXZMrKlM"" target=""_blank"">cap-and-trade</A> taxation,” said we “should be building new coal-fired plants,” and argued that the “trillions” of dollars it would cost to combat <mark>climate change</mark> would be better spent on other priorities.</P><P>All of that makes Johnson’s popularity among younger voters pretty surprising. <A href=""http://www.vox.com/2016/4/30/11535004/millennials-<mark>climate</mark>-votes"" target=""_blank"">Surveys have consistently found</A> that millennials care deeply about <mark>climate change</mark>. A November 2015 <A href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/call-<mark>climate</mark>-change-scientific-disagreement-poll/story?id=35466509"" target=""_blank"">ABC News/<EM>Washington Post </EM>poll</A>, for example, found that 76 percent of 18- to-29-year-olds see global warming as a serious problem, and 64 percent want the federal government to do more to combat it. Nevertheless, a <A href=""https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2378"" target=""_blank"">recent Quinnipiac poll</A> found that Johnson is now running second among 18- to-34-year-old voters, just 2 percentage points behind Hillary Clinton.</P><DIV class=""pullquote-left"">“At a point in the very distant future, the sun will actually encompass the Earth. So global warming is something that’s going to be inevitable.”</DIV><P>Johnson’s 2011 comments weren’t an aberration. Over the past few years, he has spoken out repeatedly against environmental regulation. In a <A href=""http://www.npr.org/2011/12/30/144495487/johnson-discusses-opting-to-seek-libertarian-nomination"" target=""_blank"">2011 NPR interview</A>, he instead called for a “free-market approach” to reducing <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, arguing that consumer demand for cleaner energy, coupled with cheap natural gas, was causing a shift away from coal. He made the same argument during a <A href=""https://www.c-span.org/video/?305765-1/libertarian-party-presidential-debate"" target=""_blank"">Libertarian presidential candidate debate in May 2012</A>. “If government gets involved” in fighting <mark>climate change</mark>, he said, “we are going to be spending trillions of dollars and have no effect whatsoever on the desired outcome.”</P><P>During his 2012 campaign, Johnson called for cutting federal spending by 43 percent. In one interview, he noted that this would also mean <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKhbc_q5G9Y"" target=""_blank"">a 43 percent reduction</A> in the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget. (During that same interview, he repeated his statement about the <A href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-sun-will-eventually-engulf-earth-maybe/"" target=""_blank"">sun eventually destroying the planet</A>: “Long-term consequence of our existence in the whole scheme of things is the sun is getting closer to the Earth and that at a point in the very distant future, the sun will actually encompass the Earth. So global warming is something that’s going to be inevitable.”)</P><P>For most of his 2016 campaign, Johnson has maintained his opposition to government efforts to deal with global warming. His campaign website <A href=""https://www.johnsonweld.com/environment"" target=""_blank"">acknowledges</A> that the <mark>climate</mark> is “probably” changing and that humans are “probably” contributing to that change. But, it adds:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>[T]he critical question is whether the politicians’ efforts to regulate, tax and manipulate the private sector are cost-effective—or effective at all. The debate should be about how we can protect our resources and environment for future generations. Governors Johnson and [Libertarian vice presidential nominee William] Weld strongly believe that the federal government should prevent future harm by focusing on regulations that protect us from real harm, rather than needlessly costing American jobs and freedom in order to pursue a political agenda.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>In July, Johnson was asked during on appearance on <EM>Real Time with Bill Maher </EM>whether he had a “comprehensive plan to combat <mark>climate change</mark>.” Johnson’s answer: “No.” He went on to argue that the coal industry’s recent struggles were a result of free-market forces (such as cheap natural gas) rather than the Obama administration’s new <mark>climate</mark> regulations. (Many experts say both factors have played significant roles in coal’s decline. Former <mark>Climate</mark> Desk reporter Tim McDonnell <A href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/01/coal-industry-terrible-no-good-very-bad-year"" target=""_blank"">has argued</A> that of the two, the market forces are indeed more important.)</P><P>But then Johnson’s stance changed dramatically. In an August <A href=""http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-gary-johnson-libertarian-transcript-20160729-snap-story.html"" target=""_blank"">interview with the <EM>Los Angeles Times</EM></A>, he announced he was “open” to the idea of the federal government imposing a revenue-neutral tax on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. Economists have long viewed a <A href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/03/british-columbia-<mark>carbon</mark>-tax-sanity"" target=""_blank""><mark>carbon</mark> tax</A> as the most efficient way of putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to limit warming—many see it as preferable to the complex <A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703467304575383373600358634"" target=""_blank"">cap-and-trade proposal</A> backed by President Barack Obama during his first term. In a subsequent <A href=""https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/libertarian-nominee-johnson-demise-republican-100125483.html"" target=""_blank"">interview on CNBC</A>, Johnson called a <mark>carbon</mark> tax a “very libertarian proposal” under which “the market will take care of” <mark>climate change</mark>. (During the Democratic primaries, <A href=""http://grist.org/politics/heres-how-the-greenest-presidential-candidate-bernie-sanders-could-get-even-greener/"" target=""_blank"">Bernie Sanders endorsed a <mark>carbon</mark> tax</A>; Clinton did not.)</P><P>Many Libertarians and conservatives were outraged by Johnson’s sudden embrace of a <mark>carbon</mark> tax. “<A href=""http://thefederalist.com/2016/08/25/gary-johnson-is-a-left-wing-candidate/"" target=""_blank"">It’s Official: Gary Johnson Is a Left-Wing Candidate</A>,” declared the <EM>Federalist</EM>, a conservative publication. After plenty of public criticism from the right, Johnson changed his mind, <A href=""http://reason.com/blog/2016/08/26/libertarian-gary-johnson-comes-out-again"" target=""_blank"">telling supporters at a New Hampshire rally</A> that after considering a <mark>carbon</mark> tax, “I have determined that, you know what, it’s a great theory, but I don’t think it can work, and I’ve worked my way through that.” His flip-flop drew loud applause from thecrowd.</P><P>Johnson elaborated in an <A href=""http://reason.com/blog/2016/08/26/gary-johnson-no-to-<mark>carbon</mark>-taxes-and-mand"" target=""_blank"">interview</A> the following day with the libertarian magazine <EM>Reason. </EM>He declared himself a “skeptic” when it comes to the idea “that government policy can address” <mark>climate</mark> issues and said a <mark>carbon</mark> tax “sounds good in theory, but it wouldn’t work in practice.”</P><P>“So, no support for a <mark>carbon</mark> fee,” Johnson added. “I never raised one penny of tax as governor of New Mexico, not one cent in any area. Taxes to me are like a death plague.”</P><P>And besides, what good will all those taxes do for us when the sun engulfs our planet?</P></ARTICLE><FOOTER class=""entry-footer""><SECTION id=""mj-article-bottom-membership-widget-3"" class=""widget mj-article-bottom-membership-widget""><H3>FIGHT DISINFORMATION:</H3><P><STRONG>Disinformation is one of the biggest threats our democracy faces.</STRONG> Like our reporting on dark money, it is one of those stories behind all the other stories.</P><P><STRONG>So we want to build a team dedicated to tracking and exposing the forces behind disinformation as a new reporting priority before this fall's midterms.</STRONG> But to do it, we need to raise $100,000 that we didn't plan on before June 30.

Eddie Bernice Johnson recently held an alternative hearing on <mark>climate change</mark> for members of Congress and the public, defying the leadership of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. Johnson, ranking member of the committee and a Democrat who represents the 30th district of Texas, decided to hold what she calls a “round table” on global warming because she feels that the committee chair—Lamar Smith (R–Texas)—has not allowed real <mark>climate</mark> experts to speak about their research at the hearings he has run. Instead, she says, Smith gives <mark>climate change</mark> deniers a platform to express their views.</P><P>Johnson says this problem is not confined to global warming, and that under Smith’s leadership the committee does not focus enough on science issues in general. So Johnson plans to host a series of these round tables on issues such as ocean acidification, environmental justice, artificial intelligence and more. <EM>Scientific American </EM>asked Smith’s staff for comments on the alternative hearings and Johnson’s remarks but did not receive a response by the time of publication.</P><P><EM>Scientific American</EM> spoke with Johnson about her plans for the round tables and what she hopes they will accomplish<EM>.</EM></P><P>[<EM>An edited transcript of the interview follows.]</EM></P><P><STRONG>You held a <mark>climate change</mark> round table late last month. What did it entail? </STRONG>
It’s important that the science behind global <mark>climate change</mark> be acknowledged. And clearly, at the rate we’re going with the leadership in the current [House Science] Committee, it’s probably not going to happen. So we wanted to make sure that the scientific information had an opportunity to be discussed.
We had that [round table], and we plan to have several more to discuss a number of topics—but [<mark>climate change</mark>] is certainly an important one. We had two panels: one with experts who could talk about the research as well as the effects of what’s happening with the <mark>climate</mark>. The second panel had to do with the international view, from ambassadors as well as participants in the [2015] Paris [<mark>climate</mark>] conference, to show that this is a world view—deniers might be confined to the United States.</P><P><STRONG>Why not discuss these issues during the standard House Science Committee hearings?</STRONG>
Because the chairman in the majority has control over what is discussed, and we have not been successful in getting [<mark>climate change</mark>] discussed with actual scientific research. Whenever the topic has come to the surface, we get at most fringe witnesses—people who agree to be in denial. The experts who do the research on a daily basis are never allowed to speak during the regular order of business.
In my judgment the country is moving backwards with this type of committee leadership. But we don’t want the public to believe that it’s the entire committee. There are people on the committee who believe strongly in research, the National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency and in NASA. So we have no choice but to attempt to do some alternative hearings to make sure that people are aware that we do believe in science, and that it should be discussed—we should not deny good research. It’s an opportunity to listen to a view that we never hear on the committee.</P><P><STRONG>What do you currently see happening with science issues in the House Science Committee?</STRONG>
There really is not much focus on the science. It’s focused on the administration or against the agencies, and it’s always an approach of suspicion and denial.</P><P><STRONG>Would you say that applies only to <mark>climate change</mark> or science issues in general?</STRONG>
It’s science issues in general. I’m in my third term of dealing with this particular chairman. And almost exclusively, the goals seem to have been pointed against anything the Obama administration had made any type of goals on—the attitude was to be against it. Now the attitude is to cut the agencies that are doing the research in these areas—as if to say: “We’re not going to even listen to them. We don’t want them to do the research.”</P><P><STRONG>You are planning to do a series of round tables. What issues do you want them to focus on?</STRONG>
We need to look at the public health implications of <mark>climate change</mark>, ocean acidification, environmental justice, biological engineering, forensic science, artificial intelligence—there are a number of issues that we’re not getting the opportunity to have honest hearings on under the leadership of this committee. We cannot afford to sit idly by and let those topics slide as if they don’t have an impact today.</P><P><STRONG>What do you hope these round tables will accomplish?</STRONG>
I don’t know the impact they might have on Congress, because those of us who are interested in getting the scientific evidence at this time appear to be Democrats—although we know there are members on the other side who are not blinded to this information. But they are influenced by their leadership.
But it’s foolhardy for us to just give in and act as if nothing is happening, just because the leadership feels that way. So I feel an obligation to respond to the public. Whether we can get [anything] done will depend on the committee leadership, and this administration’s leadership.
When you look at the cabinet that this president [Donald Trump] has put in place, it does appear that they are in agreement with each other that they’re going be in denial [about <mark>climate change</mark>], and if they don’t like the research, they stop it. Well, that is not how we got to where we are on the world stage, and I don’t think we should step off the stage as if we’re going to stop thinking and living for the future.</P><P><STRONG>Is this the beginning of a larger effort by some members to change attitudes toward science in Congress?</STRONG>
I cannot begin to guess why the attitude persists from this leadership for us to go backwards. But what I can say is, I’m not willing to cooperate with it. We might be hampered temporarily, but we want the public to understand that we do not have our heads in the sand. We’re getting a lot of positive feedback from the general public. People are very concerned about <mark>climate change</mark>, about environmental safety, about the conditions of our water and air. That concern continues to be expressed, and we feel an obligation to be responsive. At the rate we’re going, though, I don’t know how much we can do.</P><P><STRONG>Are you concerned that elected officials are putting less stock in evidence-based thinking? If so, what larger steps could help stop or even reverse this trend?</STRONG>
A leading nation cannot afford to be governed by ignorance for more than a very short period of time. The leadership that we have on this committee is out of step, and people will react to it. The facts are real. The world is aware of [<mark>climate change</mark>]. And we look like a group of ignoramuses, saying, “It’s not happening.” The people of this nation will not tolerate that for very long.
This attitude is so temporary and backwards that it’s worth pushing ahead to the extent that we can—to continue to acknowledge the scientific evidence, and hope that we don’t lose too much ground.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In 1978 a Libertarian group made a fascinating film that showed how a <A href=""http://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/libra-the-21st-century-libertarian-space-colony-512622610"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" onclick=""window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'http://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/libra-the-21st-century-libertarian-space-colony-512622610', {metric25:1})"">free market space colony might work</A>.

                     with significant increases in the frequency and severity of heat waves (extreme heat events). <mark>Climate change</mark> has also been
                     increasingly connected to detrimental human health. One of the consequences of <mark>climate</mark>-related extreme heat exposure is dehydration
                     and volume loss, leading to acute mortality from exacerbations of pre-existing chronic disease, as well as from outright heat
                     exhaustion and heat stroke. Recent studies have also shown that recurrent heat exposure with physical exertion and inadequate
                     hydration can lead to CKD that is distinct from that caused by diabetes, hypertension, or GN. Epidemics of CKD consistent
                     with heat stress nephropathy are now occurring across the world. Here, we describe this disease, discuss the locations where
                     it appears to be manifesting, link it with increasing temperatures, and discuss ongoing attempts to prevent the disease. Heat
                     stress nephropathy may represent one of the first epidemics due to global warming. Government, industry, and health policy
                     makers in the impacted regions should place greater emphasis on occupational and community interventions.

The workers arrived at dawn: men and women, young and old, wearing thick jeans, long-sleeved shirts and face scarves to prevent being scorched by the sun’s rays. They are moving quickly between rows of cane, bending, reaching, clipping and trimming in preparation for harvesting the crop in the weeks to come. In the scant shade, old Pepsi and Fanta bottles full of water swing from tree branches, untouched. Gulping only the thick air, the workers won’t stop until noon, when their shift is over.</P><P>Among them is 25-year-old Jesús Linares. His dream, he explains in English, was to be a language teacher, but like many Salvadoran children he went to work to help support his parents and siblings. Aged eight, he learned to hide in the towering canes whenever the police sought out underage workers; since then, he’s tended sugarcane from dawn to noon and then pigs until dusk. In the evenings, he tries to listen to English audio programmes or read a language book, but for the last year he’s been too tired to concentrate. So tired, in fact, that a few months ago he visited the Tierra Blanca clinic. Blood tests revealed that Linares was in the early stages of chronic kidney disease.</P><P>It’s a familiar story here in the Bajo Lempa region, where recent studies suggest that up to 25 per cent of its nearly 20,000 inhabitants have chronic kidney disease. Across El Salvador, kidney failure is the leading cause of hospital deaths in adults. But while chronic kidney disease is most commonly caused by hypertension and diabetes, two-thirds of patients in Bajo Lempa don’t have either of those conditions, and the cause of their illness remains uncertain.</P><P>Scientists have identified certain key themes. The majority of people with <A href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/43281463"">the unexplained disease are men</A>, and it strikes predominantly in hot, humid regions where people are engaged in strenuous outdoor labour: farming, fishing or construction work. Dehydration, which seems an obvious factor, causes acute kidney disease that is easily reversed by drinking water, rather than this chronic form. This has left two burning questions: what causes this new form of kidney disease, and will it be likely to spread as the world gets warmer?</P><P>Meanwhile, in El Salvador over the last two decades, more and more patients have arrived at clinics and hospitals, often taxing them to their limit. Many people, unable to get treatment, simply return to their homes to die.</P><P>“This is really a silent massacre,” says Ramón García-Trabanino, a Salvadoran kidney specialist.</P><DIV class=""media media-element-container media-image_landscape""><DIV style=""width: 793px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">© Brett Gundlock/Boreal Collective</P></DIV></DIV><P>The patients at the Hospital Nacional Rosales in San Salvador all have the same story: until three months ago they were perfectly fine. Most of them had never seen a doctor in their life before, and had ignored any early signs of ill health this time as well. The turning point came only when they were too sick to work.</P><P>Working hard lies at the heart of Salvadoran culture. During the 1980–92 civil war, the armed forces carried out a scorched-earth strategy, targeting the civilian population in the countryside to remove any possible support base for the rebels. Tens of thousands died and a quarter of the populace fled. When peace finally came, the rural communities were able to return to their land, which was parcelled out to cooperatives, industry and independent farmers. For the survivors, the only way forward was to work, and work hard, to overcome other challenges that peace could not resolve.</P><DIV class=""media media-element-container media-image_landscape""><DIV style=""width: 796px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">© Brett Gundlock/Boreal Collective</P></DIV><P>At 8,124 square miles, El Salvador is one of the world’s smallest countries, yet within its boundaries lie endless stretches of coastline, mountain ranges and an abundance of agricultural lowlands, which owe their fertility to rich volcanic soil. There are 23 volcanoes in El Salvador, standing over the cities and central plateaus like guardians. In 2013, people in the San Miguel province fled their homes when the Chaparrastique volcano began spewing hot ash and smoke into the air.</P><P>Volcanoes aren’t the only natural hazard. The country sits right where the western part of the Caribbean Plate overrides the Cocos Plate, making it one of the most seismologically active regions on earth. In 2001, two earthquakes south-west of San Miguel killed at least 1,000 people and destroyed or damaged nearly 300,000 homes.</P><P>Such challenges only add to the determination to work hard, and in keeping with this cultural work ethic, many agricultural labourers don’t admit to getting ill, even to themselves. But kidney disease is a sneaky opponent. It can totally destroy one kidney while the individual remains blissfully unaware. Only in the final stages of the disease do the workers get a hint that all is not well, and by the time they arrive at the emergency ward, they are dying.</P><P>García-Trabanino started a fellowship at the Rosales hospital as a young doctor in 1998, and what he encountered resembled a scene from a battlefield. He had expected to be treating heart disease, neurological patients, eye problems – the full gamut of medical conditions. Instead all he encountered were men dying – sometimes slowly, but usually quickly – from kidney failure. They came in such numbers that they overwhelmed the beds and spilled into the corridors.</P><DIV style=""width: 281px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">© Brett Gundlock/Boreal Collective</P></DIV><P>“Sometimes, even with [our] obsolete dialysis techniques, we managed to get some of them to survive a night. A day. A week,” he says. Most died within a month, however, and no one seemed interested in finding out why, or even how many cases there were. So García-Trabanino and a colleague started counting them, one by one, at the door of the emergency ward until, after a few months, their count reached more than 200. The Ministry of Health in El Salvador didn’t follow up on their findings, but it did grant the doctors a medal, which garnered media attention.</P><P>“The next month people from the social organisations of the coastlands came,” García-Trabanino recalls. The visitors told him stories of years of living with unexplained deaths among their otherwise healthy young people. Every other week they had to burn the dead.</P><P>“You’ve just discovered what we have been living for years,” they said. “Tell me, doctor, what is the cure?” He had no answer.</P><P>Today, the hospital has 1,000 cases of chronic kidney disease, with more than 30 new patients arriving each month. “But we only have resources for half of them,” says Ricardo Leiva, head of the nephrology unit. By the time the new victims arrive they typically need dialysis, but the waiting list is long. Sometimes the nephrologists can administer peritoneal dialysis instead, using a hard plastic tube inserted into the belly by surgery. “It is an old technique that is not being used anywhere else in the world,” says Leiva. “But we need it.”</P><P>Back in Tierra Blanca, Juan Pablo Paniagua, a lean 60-year-old with a permanent toothy grin, talks about how the disease caught him totally by surprise. Working in the cornfields since he was a boy, then as a fisherman, he felt fine until seven years ago. “Then your body starts feeling something strange. You don’t know what it is,” he says. “You don’t feel any kind of pain, but you feel like you are slowly decaying.”</P><P>Paniagua received dialysis three times a week for two and a half years. After that, he was unable to pay for the regimen, which typically runs to about $120 for a single blood-cleansing session. So the doctors showed him how to take care of a catheter in his abdomen and instructed him in how to do peritoneal dialysis at home. “I’ve had moments of nearly dying but,” he says, “once I started dialysis, I realised that I was actually improving.”</P><DIV style=""width:50%"" class=""pullquote alignleft"">We realised the problem was all across Central America and southern Mexico.</DIV><P>Early in 2016, 32-year-old José Luis Morales, a healthy-looking man with a footballer’s physique, began to feel cramps in his legs and became so weak he couldn’t pick up a glass of water. Morales works as a truck driver in Chalatenango, a humid lowland area in northern El Salvador and another hotspot for chronic kidney disease. Unable to work, he went to San Salvador to see García-Trabanino.</P><P>“He had the classic picture of this disease,” García-Trabanino says. “He is not diabetic, he is not hypertensive. He is young without any past medical history.” Blood tests revealed low potassium and high uric acid levels, which García-Trabanino treated with medication. Currently in stage two of the disease, Morales will need to take medication for the rest of his life. “We can’t revive or bring back to life the lost kidney tissue, but we can take care of what is left,” says García-Trabanino.</P><P>Chronic kidney disease destroys kidney tissue until it can no longer filter waste from the blood. Without dialysis, this can lead to high blood pressure, weakness, dizziness and a host of other symptoms. But while diabetic kidney disease damages the glomeruli, the tiny units that clean the blood, the new form destroys the renal tubules, where urine is made and transported, and the interstitium, which surrounds the other structures in the kidneys and helps maintain the right balance of fluid. This is the same pattern of damage caused by some toxins, and because the new disease hit the agricultural communities so heavily, García-Trabanino suspected that exposure to herbicides and insecticides might be to blame.</P><DIV class=""media media-element-container media-image_landscape""><DIV style=""width: 820px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">© Brett Gundlock/Boreal Collective</P></DIV><P>To investigate, he teamed up with the Emergency Social Fund for Health in Tierra Blanca, as well as with Emmanuel Jarquín, an occupational health and safety consultant. Together, they investigated the incidence of chronic kidney disease in agricultural labourers in the lowlands, and compared them with similar workers in a region 500 metres above sea level. In the latter group, however, they found almost no cases of the mysterious disease. “They were working the same crops and using the same chemicals, but they were not getting sick,” García-Trabanino says. “We were clueless.”</P><P>The physicians began to wonder if they were just seeing a local problem, as most of the patients in Rosales hospital had come from the Bajo Lempa region. So Jesús Domínguez, a Spanish volunteer physician in Tierra Blanca, went on a mission. Renting a car and equipment, he drove from Mexico to Nicaragua, stopping by fields and taking urine samples from outdoor labourers toiling under the sun. His study indicated that many of the workers were already in the first stages of chronic kidney disease.</P><P>Far from being local, says García-Trabanino, “we realised the problem was bigger than we thought, and it was all across Central America and southern Mexico”.</P><DIV style=""width:50%"" class=""pullquote alignleft"">We lose one or two people from this region every week. It’s poverty, not the disease, that kills them.</DIV><P><A href=""http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/departments/medicine/renal/Pages/RichardJohnson.aspx"">Richard J Johnson</A>, a kidney specialist at the University of Colorado, helped organise the World Congress of Nephrology in Canada in 2011. There, he learned about the strange new form of chronic kidney disease spreading through Central America. Researchers from various countries were beginning to get together and discuss the evidence. Like others, Johnson began to think about possible causes.</P><P>His own research was focused on the sugar fructose – identifying its role in obesity, high blood pressure and heart disease. When a person eats fructose, the liver bears most of the brunt, but some of the sugar eventually ends up in the kidney. With each meal, fructose enters the kidney tubules, where it is metabolised into uric acid and causes oxidative stress, both of which can damage the kidney.</P><P>At first, Johnson thought people in the sugarcane fields could be eating so much of the plant itself that they were generating high levels of uric acid and oxidative stress in their kidneys. But, he calculated, even sucking on sugarcane all day wouldn’t produce enough fructose to cause disease. Then he discovered that, under certain conditions, the body processes regular carbohydrates to make its own fructose. And one of the triggers of this deadly alchemy is simple dehydration.</P><P>Until that point, nephrologists had thought that dehydration could only cause acute kidney injury, but Johnson’s findings put a new spin on the role of insufficient water intake. Could dehydration day in, day out be causing continuous fructose overproduction that, in turn, could be leading to long-term kidney damage?</P><P>Johnson took his theory to the lab, where his team put mice in chambers and exposed them to hours of heat at a stretch. One group of mice was allowed to drink unlimited water throughout the experience, while a second group had water only in the evenings. Within five weeks the mice with a restricted water intake developed chronic kidney disease. During the day, loss of salt and water caused the mice to produce high levels of fructose, and crystals of uric acid would sometimes form as water levels dropped in their urine. When the scientists disabled the gene that metabolises fructose and repeated the experiment, neither group developed chronic kidney disease.</P><P>Johnson took these results to a meeting of the Program on Health and Work in Central America, or SALTRA, in Costa Rica in 2012, where they caught the attention of García-Trabanino: “I was astonished. His animal models were absolutely in line with our findings.”</P><P>The two collaborated to investigate the biochemical effects of dehydration on workers in the fields of El Salvador. Levels of uric acid started high in the morning and increased throughout the day. “Some patients just had sheets of uric acid crystals in their urine,” Johnson says.</P><P>From these studies, Johnson believes that heat stress and dehydration drive the production of fructose and vasopressin, which also damages the kidney. However, he believes that another mechanism may also play a part in the epidemic: rehydration with sugary drinks. Frequently, not trusting the quality of local drinking water, workers drink sodas and soft drinks, and experimental evidence suggests that doing so can lead to even more kidney damage.</P><P>“At this stage, that heat stress and dehydration might be causing this problem is still a hypothesis,” Johnson admits. “Although it is a strong one.”</P><DIV style=""width:50%"" class=""pullquote alignleft"">They went out because they were expecting it to be a relatively normal day and they got hit.</DIV><P>Each month, in the blistering afternoon heat, men sporting cowboy hats or baseball caps and women wearing short frilly aprons over their dresses gather at the Centro Cultural Monseñor Romero in Tierra Blanca. Seated in a shady area next to a garden overgrown with tropical plants, the 40-odd throng hold bottles of water provided for the occasion.</P><P>On a makeshift table, a volunteer nurse straps the inflatable cuff of a blood pressure monitor on thick arms, skinny arms, arms hardened by years of labour, wrinkled arms softened by old age. Amid the ministrations, raising his voice to drown out the chaos and laughter of children learning traditional dances nearby, Julio Miranda, the imposing leader of the Emergency Social Fund for Health, takes centre stage: “If you want to tell your experience, it will bring benefit to the community,” he says.</P><P>One by one, men and women stand to tell their stories. As they talk, heads nod in assent, some ask questions. But in true El Salvadoran style, despite the gravity of the accounts, good-humoured jibes prevail alongside the murmurs of empathy.</P><P>For Santos Coreas, an emaciated 57-year-old man who has worked in the fields since his teenage years, the money he receives from his sons working in the USA is the difference between life and death. It pays for his weekly haemodialysis, although that still falls short of the recommended three-times-a-week regime. His wife quickly interjects: “We can’t afford more; we do what we can.”</P><P>In El Salvador, social security benefits cover health costs for only a quarter of the population. Private, military and teachers’ schemes cover a further 5 per cent, and the Ministry of Health provides public healthcare to the remaining 70 per cent, according to García-Trabanino. From 2004 to 2013, in this area, 271 patients reached end-stage renal disease, the point at which the only options are dialysis or death. Only a third of them received any type of dialysis, a quarter of these relying on El Salvador’s largest source of income: relatives sending money home from abroad.</P><P>Of the 235 patients who relied on the public health system, many didn’t have access to dialysis or were afraid of outdated techniques that are associated with a high death toll. Transport costs to and from the city for treatment often proved beyond their means, too. Only 12 of these people were alive one year after diagnosis.</P><P>“You need dialysis or transplantation or you die, and we lose one or two people from this region every week,” García-Trabanino says. “It’s poverty, not the disease, that kills them.”</P><P>But dialysis isn’t the only line of defence if you can act early enough. For Rogelio Sánchez, a bout of gastroenteritis more than 10 years ago indirectly saved his life. Blood tests revealed his kidneys were in the early stages of chronic disease and, since then, medication has stopped the disease from progressing.</P><P>Sánchez has come to the meeting today with one of his four sons, Henry, a doe-eyed and healthy-looking boy who appears much younger than his 23 years. Five years ago, Henry started to feel sick and blood tests revealed that he also had the new form of chronic kidney disease. García-Trabanino, who is a volunteer physician at the meetings, prescribed a drug to boost his potassium levels, along with potassium and calcium supplements, and advised Henry to seriously reduce his football playing, avoid sun exposure and drink lots of water. Like his father, Henry now has the disease under control.</P><P>In 2006, the Emergency Social Fund for Health started taking blood samples from all the locals. In 6,000 samplings since, they have found 1,500 people in various stages of the disease. Only 100 have died, and these were workers already in the final stage. For the others, early diagnosis and medication can keep end-stage disease at bay for decades. This requires funding, however. Unsupported by the government, the organisation relies on donations. But in recent years, the number of people who need such treatment has continued to rise.</P><DIV style=""width:50%"" class=""pullquote alignleft"">We predict the kidney is going to be one of the prime targets as heat increases.</DIV><P>For Johnson, a clue as to why the epidemic is escalating came from a disturbing occurrence during his research with García-Trabanino. One day, when the field researchers were measuring uric acid levels, only seven workers showed up for work. “But they all had uric acid crystals in their urine. All of them,” Johnson says. “It was bad news for these seven.”</P><P>Alarmed, he contacted the lead investigator of the study, who felt that the team should ignore the finding as so few workers had turned up that morning. “But I said that maybe this is the most interesting group, because 100 per cent of the workers got it that day.”</P><DIV class=""media media-element-container media-image_landscape""><P>He looked up the weather and found out that it had, in fact, been the hottest day of the year at the study location. “Suddenly a really, really big heatwave came in and the workers weren’t ready,” he says. “They went out because they were expecting it to be a relatively normal day and they got hit.”</P><P>Instead of his usual fare of nephrology and diabetes papers, Johnson began to pore over global maps of <mark>climate</mark> and solar radiation. The rise in average temperatures over the last few years in Central America had been incremental, but the number of extreme events had gone up disproportionately. “And, by gosh, the areas that have the highest solar radiation and heatwaves are overlapping the places right where the epidemics are.”</P><P>He contacted <mark>climate</mark> experts at the nearby National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colorado. They verified and finessed his original discovery, and the team published an assessment report in May 2016, which suggested a connection between <mark>climate change</mark> and the epidemic. Johnson says it “may well be one of the first epidemics because of global warming”.</P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> brings dire predictions of extreme weather and sea-level rise in the future, but it is affecting the world’s most vulnerable populations right now, he says. And although heat exposure can affect the body in many ways, our kidneys are in the first line of attack, as their role is to keep electrolytes within the normal range and blood volume stable. “We predict the kidney is going to be one of the prime targets as heat increases.”</P><P>Researchers currently classify the new form of chronic kidney disease as ‘<mark>climate</mark>-sensitive’, which means that <mark>climate</mark> is one ingredient contributing to the epidemic. As temperatures continue to rise, many such <mark>climate</mark>-sensitive diseases will become <mark>climate</mark>-driven, and monitoring and bringing attention to them will become even more crucial.</P><DIV style=""width:50%"" class=""pullquote alignleft"">It starts as a little problem and it will grow and grow and grow.</DIV><P>“<mark>Climate change</mark> is not like a new thing, it has been here for a long time,” says Emmanuel Jarquín, who has seen the impacts of rising temperatures on farmers in El Salvador. Already the country has had hotter summers and longer, drier winters. Coffee plantations, usually between 600 and 1,000 metres above sea level, where ideal cool conditions exist for the crop, have shrunk upwards towards the top of the hillsides. The heat has also increased the number of pests and droughts, and some farmers have begun to swap coffee for cocoa trees.</P><P>And while <mark>climate change</mark> isn’t the root cause of the new chronic kidney disease, it is making it a lot worse, he says. “It will hit the poor people harder. It starts as a little problem and it will grow and grow and grow.”</P><P>For the people of El Salvador, then, this is yet another life-threatening obstacle to overcome. Living under constant threat from earthquakes and volcanoes, but also gang violence, political unrest and poverty, they have developed a strong defence mechanism: a forceful loyalty to family, community and fellow countrymen. “Even taking into account the conditions we live in, we still believe in good things and we are fighters,” says Jarquín. “We always try to do good things, against all odds.”</P><P>For García-Trabanino, the towering volcanoes have come to symbolise what it means to be El Salvadoran: “I used to think we were stupid people when I was younger, to build under the volcanoes,” he says. “But then I realised they were everywhere.” But living underneath the volcanoes gives people both an appreciation of life – because they can die any day – and a sense of strength.</P><P>“We have survived the civil war, earthquakes and volcanoes, but El Salvadorans fight, and they will fight again.”</P><P> </P><P>This <A href=""https://mosaicscience.com/story/<mark>climate</mark>-change-deadly-epidemic-chronic-kidney-disease"">article</A> first appeared on <A href=""https://mosaicscience.com"">Mosaic</A> and is republished here under a Creative Commons licence.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><H2 class=""citations-label"">JSTOR Citations</H2><P class=""citation-author"">By: Oriana Ramirez-Rubio, Michael D McClean, Juan José Amador and Daniel R Brooks</P><P class=""citation-source""><EM>Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (1979-) </EM>, Vol. 67, No. 1 (January 2013), pp. 1-3</P><P class=""citation-publisher"">BMJ</P></DIV><DIV id=""author-box"" class=""single-box""><DIV class=""clearfix inner""><DIV class=""author-info""><H2><A href=""https://daily.jstor.org/author/jane-palmer/"" rel=""author"">

But even before the Donald Trump administration <A href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/05/what-s-trump-s-2018-budget-request-science"" target=""_blank"" class=""content-link external"">proposed a 22 percent cut</A> to the agency’s budget, the odds of expanded federal backing were slim.</P><P>Then Johnson got an email from billionaire Paul Allen’s director of <mark>climate</mark> and energy initiatives, Spencer Reeder.</P><P>Turns out the Microsoft co-founder and eclectic philanthropist was interested in the deep oceans. “They asked if I would be interested in submitting a proposal,” Johnson recalled.</P><P>“Of course I was.”</P><P>The result is a $4 million grant from Paul G. Allen Philanthropies to deploy the first large-scale array of the new sensors, called Deep Argo floats. The data they collect on temperature and salinity will help scientists fill in gaps in their understanding of the ocean’s response to <mark>climate change</mark>, and how the deep abyss might affect weather, <mark>climate</mark> and future sea-level rise.</P><P>“Frankly, we weren’t seeing a lot of evidence that the federal government was going to be funding that in an aggressive way, so this seemed like an opportunity where Paul could step in and have a meaningful impact,” Reeder said. Negotiations on the grant began long before the November election, he added.</P><DIV class=""image-single-wrapper image-10485991-430048634 ""><FIGURE id=""image-10485991"" class=""article-figure align-none ""><FIGCAPTION class=""article-figure-caption""><SPAN class=""caption"">R/V Petrel, seen at dusk, is a 250-foot research and exploration vessel purchased in 2016 by Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul G. Allen. (Courtesy of Paul G.

Since 1970, the oceans have absorbed more than 90 percent of the excess heat from greenhouse warming, Johnson explained.</P><P>That heat can cause changes in ocean circulation, which impacts temperatures and rainfall around the globe.</P><P>“The ocean is the flywheel of the <mark>climate</mark> system,” Johnson said.</P><P>The new project builds on nearly two decades of data collected by <A href=""http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/"" target=""_blank"" class=""content-link external"">Argo</A>, an international fleet of nearly 4,000 robotic probes in constant motion across the world’s oceans, measuring temperature and salinity down to about 1.25 miles.</P><P>That work has documented <A href=""http://www.nature.com/n<mark>climate</mark>/journal/v6/n2/full/n<mark>climate</mark>2872.html?foxtrotcallback=true"" target=""_blank"" class=""content-link external"">temperature increases and salinity changes</A> linked to <mark>climate change</mark>. But information about the deep ocean, up to 3.7 miles down, has been much harder to come by.</P><P>Until recently, many oceanographers assumed that there would be little change at such depths, said University of Washington oceanographer Stephen Riser, a leader in the <A href=""http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/robot-buoys-are-taking-the-oceans-pulse/"" class=""content-link"">original Argo </A>program.</P><P>But a series of shipboard surveys conducted decades apart revealed tiny, but significant, temperature increases over the past 30 years. Spread over the vast volume of water, that represents a much larger amount of heat being stored in the ocean depths than anyone imagined.</P><P>Scientists suspect greenhouse warming is the cause, though they aren’t certain and natural cycles could also play a role. It’s important to find out, Johnson said.</P><P>“Measuring where, how much and how fast the ocean is warming will help us project where, how much and how fast the atmosphere will warm and sea levels will rise in the future,” Johnson said.</P><P>The slender, aluminum Argo probes that excel in shallow water would never survive conditions near the seafloor. So researchers have developed a <A href=""https://www.<mark>climate</mark>.gov/news-features/<mark>climate</mark>-tech/deep-argo-diving-answers-ocean%E2%80%99s-abyss"" target=""_blank"" class=""content-link external"">next-generation probe </A>for deep water, with its workings encased in a tough, glass sphere that can stand up to extreme cold and pressures 600 times greater than at the surface.</P><P>Like all Argo probes, the robots are designed to operate autonomously. A small pump controls buoyancy, allowing the probe to sink, then rise slowly through the water column, collecting data that it transmits electronically when it surfaces.</P><P>For the Allen-funded project, Johnson and his colleagues picked the basin off Brazil, where a bottom layer of frigid water from Antarctica flows up from the south and interacts with deep water flowing from the North Atlantic. “It’s an interesting, dynamic place,” Johnson said.</P><P>It’s also largely ice-free, which will provide an easier testing ground for the new instruments.</P><P>An initial batch of five instruments should arrive soon at NOAA’s <A href=""https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/"" target=""_blank"" class=""content-link external"">Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory</A> at Sand Point, where scientists will run them through a series to tests to ensure they work properly. The team hopes to deploy the full array within the next two years.</P><P>“This is really a pilot project,” Riser said. “We’re going to see what we can learn and whether we can manage the technological challenges.”</P><P>If the array yields valuable data, Johnson hopes to leverage that to eventually expand the network to include 1,200 Deep Argo probes — enough to extend the project’s coverage to 99 percent of the ocean volume.</P><P>“This is a big goal for me,” he said. “I’ve been involved with Argo since the beginning and I would like to see us take it truly global by measuring the bottom half of the ocean as well as the top half.”</P><P>Another of Johnson’s passions is haiku. In 2014, he earned a burst of<A href=""http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-scientist-distills-2200-page-report-into-haiku/"" class=""content-link""> internet celebrity</A> by distilling a 2,200-page <mark>climate</mark>-change summary report into a series of 19 of the short Japanese poems, with watercolor illustrations.</P><P>So naturally, he decided to encapsulate the essence of the new project in haiku form as well:</P><P>Abyssal ocean,</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Johnson Design Center</A> (SJDC) at the Parsons School of Design in Manhattan.</P><P>“Museums provide opportunities for physical, emotional, and social learning,” Massie said. “The ongoing discoveries, the data and numbers and graphs — all of that is essential, but most of us need context, narrative, sensory details, and a sense of community — a peer group — to grapple with both the abstractness of raw scientific information and, in the case of <mark>climate</mark>, the gravity of its meaning.”</P><FIGURE id=""attachment_425025"" style=""width: 720px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text""><EM>Peggy Weil: 88 Cores</EM> in <EM>In Human Time</EM> at the Parsons School of Design’s Sheila Johnson Design Center (photo by the author for Hyperallergic)</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P><EM>In Human Time</EM> focuses on polar ice in a two-part exhibition, acting as a case study in using art to encourage awareness of <mark>climate</mark> issues.

The second part —<EM><A href=""https://www.inhumantime.org/"">Peggy Weil: 88 Cores</A></EM> — is on view through February 11. In the SJDC’s Arnold and Sheila Aronson Galleries, the video “88 Cores” slowly pans over ice cores drilled from the Greenland Ice Sheet between 1989 and 1993. Photographs of gleaming ice samples from various depths and ages are installed like totems on the gallery walls.</P><P>“<mark>Climate change</mark> occurs in the extremes of scale of time and place,”<A href=""http://pweilstudio.com/project/88-cores/"">Weil</A> stated. “’88 Cores,’ a four-hour and 29-minute continuous descent through two miles and 110,000 years, engages the senses in deep time and deep space.”</P><P><EM>In Human Time</EM> is the first public showing of “88 Cores,” part of Weil’s <EM>underlandscapes</EM> series. It follows <EM>UnderLA</EM> which visualized a subterranean landscape in the Los Angeles Aquifer, and <EM>Oscar-Zero</EM> on a nuclear launch center in North Dakota. Each project uses digital media to reveal hidden, and often precarious, terrains.</P><P>Ice cores act as <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleothermometer"">paleothermometers</A>, or tools for understanding the temperatures of the past. For instance, ash from 18th-century volcanic eruptions can be detected in the compressed layers of ice, as well as more recent <A href=""https://www.bas.ac.uk/data/our-data/publication/ice-cores-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">concentrations of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide</A>. “88 Cores” is accompanied by a droning score by <A href=""http://www.threethirtythree.biz/"">Celia Hollander</A>, which slows down over the course of the video, reinforcing the monumental timeline represented by this ice. Alongside, the photographs highlight details like cracks from excavation, banding from dust and debris, and scientific notations, reminding viewers of the vulnerability of this polar ice, and the importance of studying its fragile data.</P><P>In the adjacent hallway are contextual objects such as a canister used to ship excavated ice cores, and 1882 editions of Mary Shelley’s <EM>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, </EM>reflecting a long cultural and scientific fascination in the Arctic and Antarctic. (Dr. Frankenstein and his monstrous creation meet their end on the unforgiving landscape of the North Pole.) These pieces represent the multidisciplinary aim of the <mark>Climate</mark> Museum, where art, science, and design can all be employed in not just talking about <mark>climate change</mark>, but considering pathways forward.</P><FIGURE id=""attachment_425026"" style=""width: 720px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Installation view of <EM>In Human Time</EM> at the Parsons School of Design’s Sheila Johnson Design Center (photo by the author for Hyperallergic)</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><FIGURE id=""attachment_425027"" style=""width: 720px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">1882 copies of <EM>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus</EM> by Mary Shelley, a novel which features the North Pole (photo by the author for Hyperallergic)</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>While a permanent venue for the <mark>Climate</mark> Museum is still a ways off, these intersections of art and science will continue to be explored in community engagement projects. “For the next two years or so, we’ll offer a range of public programs in loaned, shared, and public spaces — an arts and sciences festival in the fall, further exhibitions, a panel discussion series, and the like,” Massie explained. “Then we’ll open a museum lab space to show why <mark>climate</mark> programming like this needs a home, a hub.

Most companies don’t agree with his notion that <mark>climate</mark> action is bad for the economy, as evidenced in part by a recent full-page <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM> ad signed by the CEOs of companies across sectors. Trump, in other words, may be ignoring a clear message coming from our titans of industry. He has claimed for a long time to want to put America first, but by abdicating his responsibility and leadership for the greatest challenge facing humanity, the country may lag. He may, in fact, be putting America last.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article article-first-row""><P>According to reports, <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/<mark>climate</mark>/trump-quits-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-accord.html"" target=""_blank"">President Trump is expected to pull the U.S. out of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement</A>.

Nor is what we could analyze — from what will actually change in how the U.S. uses energy or emits <mark>carbon</mark> if the agreement is abandoned (it’s not a straightforward discussion by any means) to what states, cities, and citizens can do as a result.</P><P>But the key point I want to make here is that <EM>the business community does not want to leave the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement</EM>. Let me repeat: Even though Trump and his team keep telling everyone that <mark>climate</mark> action is somehow bad for the economy, most companies don’t agree with that assessment.</P><P>On May 10, in an attempt to influence the president’s thinking, 30 CEOs wrote an open letter to Trump, taking out a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal. The opening reads, “We are writing to express our strong support for the U.S. remaining in the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement.” I won’t reprint the whole letter here, but <A href=""http://bteam.org/announcements/30-major-ceos-call-on-trump-stay-in-paris/"" target=""_blank"">please read it</A>.</P><P>It is, however, worth taking a moment to look at the companies whose CEOs made their views known:</P><P>3M Company</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE-CONTENT></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

We estimate paleotemperatures for the last ≈1.1 million years of the Cretaceous (≈66.6–65.5 million years ago, Ma) by using fossil plants from North Dakota and employ paleomagnetic stratigraphy to correlate the results to foraminiferal paleoclimatic data from four middle- and high-latitude sites. Both plants and foraminifera indicate warming near 66.0 Ma, a warming peak from ≈65.8 to 65.6 Ma, and cooling near 65.6 Ma, suggesting that these were global <mark>climate</mark> shifts. The warming peak coincides with the immigration of a thermophilic flora, maximum plant diversity, and the poleward range expansion of thermophilic foraminifera. Plant data indicate the continuation of relatively cool temperatures across the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary; there is no indication of a major warming immediately after the boundary as previously reported. Our temperature proxies correspond well with recent <EM>p</EM>CO<SUB>2</SUB> data from paleosol <mark>carbon</mark>ate, suggesting a coupling of <EM>p</EM>CO<SUB>2</SUB> and temperature. To the extent that biodiversity is correlated with temperature, estimates of the severity of end-Cretaceous extinctions that are based on occurrence data from the warming peak are probably inflated, as we illustrate for North Dakota plants. However, our analysis of <mark>climate</mark> and facies considerations shows that the effects of bolide impact should be regarded as the most significant contributor to these plant extinctions.</P></DIV><P id=""p-5"">In contrast to the well resolved marine record (<A id=""xref-ref-1-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-1"">1</A>–<A id=""xref-ref-6-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-6"">6</A>), terrestrial <mark>climate</mark>s near the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–P), a time marked by bolide impact (<A id=""xref-ref-7-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-7"">7</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-8-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-8"">8</A>) and mass extinctions (<A id=""xref-ref-9-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-9"">9</A>–<A id=""xref-ref-15-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-15"">15</A>), remain poorly known. Paleobotanical reports have suggested long-term cooling across the K–P in Asia (<A id=""xref-ref-16-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-16"">16</A>), no temperature change (<A id=""xref-ref-10-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-10"">10</A>) or a major temperature increase soon after the boundary (<A id=""xref-ref-17-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-17"">17</A>) in the Raton Basin of New Mexico and Colorado, and latest Cretaceous warming followed by a cooler Paleocene in North Dakota (<A id=""xref-ref-18-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-18"">18</A>). Fine-scale correlations between continental and marine temperature records near the K–P have previously not been attempted (<A id=""xref-ref-5-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-5"">5</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-19-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-19"">19</A>), though such data would help to assess the global extent of warming and cooling events as well as the correlation of partial pressure of CO<SUB>2</SUB> (<EM>p</EM>CO<SUB>2</SUB>) and temperature (<A id=""xref-ref-20-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-20"">20</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-21-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-21"">21</A>). Detection of climatic shifts just before the K–P would refine understanding of the mass extinction event by making it possible to distinguish the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> from those of bolide impact on biodiversity.</P><P id=""p-6"">The most intensively sampled sequence of plant macrofossils that spans the K–P is exposed in southwestern North Dakota (<A id=""xref-ref-19-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-19"">19</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-22-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-22"">22</A>). Previous estimates of K–P plant extinction in these strata range from 70 to 90% (<A id=""xref-ref-11-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-11"">11</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-19-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-19"">19</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-23-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-23"">23</A>). Here, we apply recent improvements in the stratigraphic resolution, sample size, and known diversity of the North Dakota floras to produce high-resolution paleoclimatic analyses. The development of a paleomagnetic stratigraphy for the study area (<A id=""xref-ref-22-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-22"">22</A>) allows us to correlate paleobotanical and marine data by using a revised time scale with a K–P age of 65.51 million years ago (Ma) (<A id=""xref-ref-22-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-22"">22</A>) and 0.333-million year (m.y.) and 0.270-m.y. durations for the Cretaceous and Paleocene portions, respectively, of magnetic polarity subchron 29r (<A id=""xref-ref-24-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-24"">24</A>). We present a revision of the marine record for the last ≈1.1 m.y. of the Cretaceous (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-1-1"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">1</A>).

The included rock units are the Cretaceous Hell Creek and the predominantly Paleocene Fort Union formations. Both represent floodplain environments; channel deposits dominate the Hell Creek locally, whereas pond and mire remains make up the bulk of the Fort Union Formation.</P><P id=""p-9"">The K–P is recognized in the area by an iridium anomaly, shocked minerals, and a spherule layer, all thought to be products of the Chicxulub impact (<A id=""xref-ref-11-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-11"">11</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-19-5"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-19"">19</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-30-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-30"">30</A>).

Macrofossils of typical Cretaceous plants occur as high as 2 m below (≪0.1 m.y. before) the K–P, and their last appearances at this level are associated with a shift to mire deposition in the Cretaceous portion of the Fort Union Formation (<A id=""xref-ref-30-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-30"">30</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-31-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-31"">31</A>).

Despite differences of taxonomic resolution and taphonomy, palynomorphs and macrofossils are derived from the same source vegetation. Therefore, the loss of macrofossil species 2 m below the K–P has been interpreted primarily as a pseudoextinction related to facies change that masks a true extinction at the K–P (<A id=""xref-ref-30-5"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-30"">30</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-31-5"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-31"">31</A>).

The 386 types of plant organs recovered represent an estimated 353 species, a 43% increase. This estimate is equal to the total number of described species and undescribed morphospecies (hereafter referred to as “species” for convenience) that are represented by leaves, discriminated on the basis of details of foliar architecture (<A id=""xref-ref-19-9"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-19"">19</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-32-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-32"">32</A>).

All specimens were collected by K.R.J., and vouchers are housed at the Yale Peabody Museum and the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science.</P><P id=""p-11"">Our age model for paleobotanical data is that of Hicks <EM>et al.</EM> (<A id=""xref-ref-22-5"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-22"">22</A>), constructed by using linear extrapolation of sedimentation rates from the K–P down to the base or up to the top of subchron 29r, respectively, for Cretaceous or Paleocene ages (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-2"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A>). Neither the bottom of subchron 30n nor the top of subchron 29n is present in the section, so the modeled ages should be considered most accurate within subchron 29r, where they are each bounded by two datum points. Standard deviations on the meter levels of the base and top of subchron 29r in various section legs (<A id=""xref-ref-22-6"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-22"">22</A>) translate via our age model to 0.107 and 0.033 m.y. for the Cretaceous and Paleocene, respectively, which can be regarded as minimum errors of our age estimates. To streamline analysis, the paleobotanical data were organized into bins of 1 m each; bin midpoints were used to derive age estimates.</P><P id=""p-12"">Paleotemperatures were estimated by using leaf-margin analysis, a method that employs the significant correlation observed in living mesic forests between mean annual temperature and the proportion of woody dicot species with untoothed leaf margins (<A id=""xref-ref-27-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-27"">27</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-35-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-35"">35</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-36-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-36"">36</A>). For fossil floras, the regression is inverted so that the proportion of untoothed species is scored as the independent and temperature computed as the dependent variable. Here we use the calibration based on East Asian forests (<A id=""xref-ref-35-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-35"">35</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-36-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-36"">36</A>), which has produced estimates that are generally accurate within ±2°C when tested on modern floras from the Americas (<A id=""xref-ref-27-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-27"">27</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-37-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-37"">37</A>–<A id=""xref-ref-39-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-39"">39</A>) and paleotemperature estimates for early Cenozoic floras that agree closely with other proxies (<A id=""xref-ref-40-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-40"">40</A>–<A id=""xref-ref-43-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-43"">43</A>). The calibration does not appear to be sensitive to <EM>p</EM>CO<SUB>2</SUB> (<A id=""xref-ref-44-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-44"">44</A>), though more work is needed in this area. Promising methods have been proposed that use as many as 30 morphological characters for each species in addition to margin type (<A id=""xref-ref-17-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-17"">17</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-45-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-45"">45</A>). However, in practice, the additional characters tend to add more noise than signal (<A id=""xref-ref-27-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-27"">27</A>), and leaf-margin analysis generally has produced equally or more accurate temperature estimates than multivariate alternatives when tested on living forests from known <mark>climate</mark>s (<A id=""xref-ref-27-4"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-27"">27</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-37-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-37"">37</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-39-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-39"">39</A>).</P><P id=""p-13"">Of 309 species of dicot leaves, 302, collectively represented by more than 18,000 specimens, were suitable for leaf-margin analysis because their margin states could be determined and they were probably derived from woody plants. Their occurrence data were used to derive two series of temperature estimates (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-3"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>a</EM>); in both cases a minimum of 20 species was used for each estimate because of the well-documented importance of sample richness for precision (<A id=""xref-ref-27-5"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-27"">27</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-38-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-38"">38</A>). The first series was a set of conventional “spot” estimates for the 13 stratigraphic bins with 20 or more species each (maximum of 73 species). Second was a complementary series of lower-precision estimates for 80 bins with 20 or more species each on a range-through basis (maximum of 92), such that a species was considered to be present if it either (<EM>i</EM>) occurred in the bin or (<EM>ii</EM>) occurred at any pair of levels both above and below but not in the bin. The range-through approach provides temperature estimates for intervals with no spot data and allows a more complete comparison through time of relative changes in temperature and species richness (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-4"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>b</EM>). The analysis assumes that a range gap is due only to sampling and not to emigration of a species followed by its immigration; this assumption undoubtedly is not valid for all gaps. However, the two data series show similar relative trends (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-5"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>a</EM>), suggesting that the range-through curve provides a reasonably precise complementary signal to spot data.</P><P id=""p-14"">The spot estimates tended to be warmer than range-through data (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-6"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>a</EM>), probably reflecting biases favoring toothed species in the many small samples that contribute to the range-through data. The overrepresentation of toothed species in small samples could result from their high relative abundance in original vegetation (<A id=""xref-ref-27-6"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-27"">27</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-38-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-38"">38</A>) or a toothed bias in original vegetation growing near bodies of water (<A id=""xref-ref-38-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-38"">38</A>). The bins used for spot estimates comprise the best point samples of dicot richness and contain the greatest numbers of species that are found only in single bins. Within bins, these species tend to have a lower percentage of toothed margins than the bin as a whole.</P><P id=""p-15"">In addition to leaf-margin data, we noted the presence and abundance of palms, a conventional proxy for warm winters without hard frost (<A id=""xref-ref-46-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-46"">46</A>), and we plotted the range of the thermophilic “HCIII” flora (<A id=""xref-ref-18-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-18"">18</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-19-11"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-19"">19</A>), which contains immigrant taxa from the Southern Rockies (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-7"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>b</EM>).</P><P id=""p-16"">Species richness, including non-dicots (353 total species based on leaves), is plotted for comparison to temperature (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-8"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>b</EM>), both as (<EM>i</EM>) the raw number of species per bin, including the species only found in single bins, and (<EM>ii</EM>) the total number of range-through species exclusive of species only found in single bins, hereafter designated as “standing richness.” This metric of standing richness is used because the derivation closely matches that of the range-through temperature curve used for comparison (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-9"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>b</EM>). Single-bin species are eliminated because they possess a number of detrimental properties for estimating standing richness (<A id=""xref-ref-47-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-47"">47</A>), though they are needed in the temperature estimates to increase precision and to offset possible biases favoring the collection of toothed species. The decreases in standing richness toward the bottom and top of Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-10"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>b</EM> are edge effects: the number of overlapping ranges diminishes artifactually near the bounds of the sampled interval. A conservative interpretation of per-capita origination and extinction rates for each bin, after Foote (<A id=""xref-ref-47-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-47"">47</A>), shows that edge effects have a negligible effect on standing richness between ≈66.2 and ≈65.2 Ma (P.W. and K.R.J., unpublished data). Because they do not include range data, the raw richness data are immune to edge effects by definition.</P><P id=""p-17"">Sampling was most intensive within ≈20 m of the K–P (<A id=""xref-ref-19-12"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-19"">19</A>), which biases against the observation of floral richness before ≈65.9 Ma (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-11"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>b</EM>). The specimen count for the lowest 10 m of Paleocene strata is ≈60% greater than for the highest 10 m of the Cretaceous, which biases against the observation of a decline in richness across the K–P. The modeled ages and leaf-margin and richness data for each bin are given in Table 8, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""section"" id=""sec-4""><H2>Results</H2><DIV id=""sec-5"" class=""subsection""><H3>Foraminifera.</H3><P id=""p-18"">Most of the marine data indicate warming near 66.0 Ma, peak temperatures near 65.7 Ma, and cooling to prewarming temperatures less than 0.1 m.y. before the K–P (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-1-4"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">1</A>). At Bass River, planktic foraminifera suggest a warming of 4–5°C at ≈65.8 Ma and sustained high temperatures until just before the K–P. Within the warm interval, a thermophilic planktic foraminifer, <EM>Pseudotextularia elegans</EM>, expanded its range poleward and reached its maximum size and peak abundance in the western North Atlantic (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-1-5"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">1</A><EM>a</EM>) (<A id=""xref-ref-5-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-5"">5</A>). The benthic warming at Bass River is dampened by comparison to the planktic record. A surface cooling of 4–5°C, reversing the preceding warming, occurred less than 0.1 m.y. before the K–P. Planktic data (not shown) tentatively suggest the continuation of cool surface temperatures into the earliest Paleocene (<A id=""xref-ref-5-4"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-5"">5</A>). At Site 525A, benthic and planktic records suggest a 2–3°C warming from ≈65.9 to 65.7 Ma and cooling less than 0.1 m.y. before the K–P. The coarsely spaced data from Site 1050 corroborate a warming by 65.7 Ma and cooler temperatures less than 0.1 m.y. before the K–P.

A long-term cooling trend occurred over the last 50 m.y. of the Cretaceous, and the coolest deep and surface water temperatures of this interval are recorded in Site 690 sediments from ≈66.6 Ma (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-1-7"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">1</A><EM>b</EM>) (<A id=""xref-ref-48-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-48"">48</A>). Bottom and surface waters warmed near 66.2 Ma and again at ≈66.0 Ma. Peak surface and bottom water temperatures occurred between ≈65.7 and 65.6 Ma, which includes the only time when <EM>P. elegans</EM> is found at Site 690 (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-1-8"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">1</A><EM>b</EM>) (<A id=""xref-ref-2-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-2"">2</A>).

The oldest floras with 20 or more dicot species occur from ≈66.5 to 66.4 Ma and produce temperatures of 12–13°C (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-13"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>a</EM>). A cooler interval is indicated from ≈66.3 to 66.0 Ma, including the lowest estimate for the section, ≈7°C. This cooling is not matched by the marine data and may be partly artifactual because of an unusual mode of floral preservation: floras from this interval mostly occur in inclined point-bar deposits and are characterized by small-leaved, possibly shrubby or herbaceous plant species that generally have toothed leaves (<A id=""xref-ref-51-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-51"">51</A>). Alternatively, the modeled age of this cooling may be imprecise because it is well below the base of subchron 29r, and it may instead correspond to the minimum marine temperatures from ≈66.6 Ma. In either case, a sustained and pronounced warming that strongly agrees with the marine record follows.</P><P id=""p-21"">Temperatures increase to 16–17°C at ≈66.0 Ma. The peak of warming occurs between ≈65.8 and 65.6 Ma, accompanied by the immigration of the rich, thermophilic “HCIII” flora (<A id=""xref-ref-18-4"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-18"">18</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-19-13"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-19"">19</A>) (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-14"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>b</EM>, arrows). Within this terminal Cretaceous warm interval, palms exceeded 5% of total specimens at four census sites of greater than 300 specimens each. The timing of the warm interval coincides with that seen in the marine record and also is synchronous with the <EM>P. elegans</EM> data from Bass River and Site 690 (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-1-10"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">1</A><EM>c</EM>). The warmest estimate of the floral sequence, ≈20°C, occurs at ≈65.7 Ma and coincides with maximum plant richness (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-15"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>b</EM>). Temperatures near 18°C are indicated less than 0.1 m.y. before the K–P.</P><P id=""p-22"">Range-through data suggest an abrupt subsequent cooling immediately before the K–P, coeval with marine cooling (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-1-11"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">1</A><EM>c</EM>). Interpretation is complicated by the lack of a spot estimate due to low site richness, and the indicated ≈9°C temperatures are probably too cold. A combination of all 24 species found within the uppermost 3 m generates a more robust estimate of ≈11°C, which suggests a latest Cretaceous cooling of ≈7°C to temperatures similar to before ≈66.0 Ma. The cooling locally coincides with the deposition of mire facies of the basal Fort Union Formation (<A id=""xref-ref-31-6"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-31"">31</A>). A ≈14°C estimate is derived from a flora 20 cm above the K–P (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-16"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>a</EM>), implying a slight warming immediately before or after the K–P; palms are present in this earliest Paleocene sample.

These numbers are too low for reliable analysis of paleotemperature, regardless of whether univariate or multivariate methods are used (<A id=""xref-ref-27-7"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-27"">27</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-38-4"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-38"">38</A>), especially for “Phase 3.” Recently, Beerling <EM>et al.</EM> (<A id=""xref-ref-20-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-20"">20</A>) provisionally suggested an increase in <EM>p</EM>CO<SUB>2</SUB> immediately after the K–P to &gt;2,300 ppm, which presumably would have been linked to high temperatures. We regard this result, based on stomatal index values for a fern taxon (aff. <EM>Stenochlaena</EM>) recovered from ≤25 cm above the K–P in the Raton Basin, as speculative for the reasons stated or implied by the authors. First, the stomatal response of the fern's presumed modern relative to <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is statistically incompatible with the results from the fossil fern, suggesting that the modern and fossil species are not closely related and may not be suitable for comparison. Second, the fossil fern has not been found in other stratigraphic horizons so as to allow calibration of its stomatal indices to baseline values. Therefore, the fossil stomatal data (<A id=""xref-ref-20-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-20"">20</A>) appear to us to be reliable indicators neither of high nor low <EM>p</EM>CO<SUB>2</SUB> during the earliest Paleocene.</P></DIV><DIV class=""section"" id=""sec-8""><H2><mark>Climate Change</mark>s Before K–P Extinction</H2><P id=""p-26"">We examined the linkage of plant diversity in our study area with <mark>climate</mark> (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-17"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>b</EM>). Standing richness and range-through temperature are weakly but significantly correlated through the interval from ≈66.2 to 65.5 Ma, where correlation is possible because of negligible edge-effects on richness and nearly continuous range-through estimates of temperature; detrending was applied to mitigate the significant autocorrelations and time correlations of each variable (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-18"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>b</EM>). Notably, the correlation is poor before ≈66.0 Ma, when cool temperatures occur along with rich floras. The strongest correspondence is seen from ≈65.8 Ma to the K–P, when temperature and floral richness both reach maxima, diminish slightly, then decrease abruptly during the last 0.1 m.y. of the Cretaceous (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-19"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>b</EM>). The decrease coincides with the presence of mire deposits and the taphonomic loss of typical species of Cretaceous macrofossils (<A id=""xref-ref-31-7"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-31"">31</A>).</P><P id=""p-27"">Latest Cretaceous cooling probably contributed to a decline in plant richness by eliminating elements of the thermophilic flora that was present during the time of peak warmth (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-20"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>b</EM>, arrows). However, several lines of evidence indicate that <mark>climate change</mark> was not the principal cause of plant extinctions across the K–P. First, older Cretaceous floras were rich, despite cool <mark>climate</mark>s and a relatively low intensity of sampling: five of the bins from before ≈66.0 Ma have more than 25 species each, and standing richness exceeds 60 species continuously from ≈66.3 to 65.6 Ma (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-21"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>b</EM>). A bin with 30 species on a raw-count basis occurs at ≈66.4 Ma and one with 50 species at ≈66.3 Ma (Fig. <A id=""xref-fig-2-22"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">2</A><EM>b</EM>), when both foraminiferal and plant data indicate cold temperatures. Paleocene floras, which grew at similar temperatures to the portion of the Cretaceous before ≈66.0 Ma, were depauperate: the richest Paleocene flora occurs in the bin immediately above the K–P, with 25 species. Second, the presence of diagnostically Cretaceous palynomorphs (<A id=""xref-ref-30-6"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-30"">30</A>) within the mire deposits that we correlate to the terminal cool interval shows both that a major extinction related to cooling did not take place and that typical Cretaceous plants were still present but not preserved as macrofossils. This interpretation does not exclude the possibility that some species were lost because of cooling, and we note that the drop in abundance and diversity of typical Cretaceous palynomorphs within the mire deposits (<A id=""xref-ref-30-7"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-30"">30</A>) might reflect the effects of cooling as well as facies changes. Third, the occurrence and occasional abundance of palms during the earliest Paleocene indicates that hard freezes, which could have negatively affected richness, were at most infrequent despite relatively low mean annual temperatures. This interpretation of low temperature seasonality is corroborated by the abundance of crocodilian, champsosaur, and turtle remains in correlative strata (<A id=""xref-ref-56-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-56"">56</A>). Fourth, our Paleocene floras overwhelmingly bear the imprint of ecological trauma, including the loss of all Cretaceous dominant species from all facies (<A id=""xref-ref-11-5"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-11"">11</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-19-14"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-19"">19</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-23-4"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-23"">23</A>), diminishing richness after the K–P that is in accord with continuing taxonomic losses observed in the wake of other extinction events (<A id=""xref-ref-57-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-57"">57</A>), and the nearly total disappearance of specialized types of insect feeding on leaves (<A id=""xref-ref-15-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-15"">15</A>). The effects of bolide impact provide the most plausible explanation for these phenomena.</P><P id=""p-28"">In conclusion, cooling during the final 0.1 m.y. of the Cretaceous probably accounts for some loss of richness from the peak diversity of the preceding warm interval, and the relatively lower frequency of channel deposits, which were the source of the majority of the Cretaceous floras, above the K–P is also likely to inflate the apparent magnitude of extinction across the K–P. Previous observations of the loss of 70–90% of macrofossil species (<A id=""xref-ref-23-5"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-23"">23</A>) were based, by necessity, on floras from the peak of warmth and floral diversity that are lost from the record taphonomically during the ensuing, terminal Cretaceous cooling. Conservatively, these percentages are best regarded as maximum estimates of the K–P plant extinction, whereas the 30% palynofloral extinction observed in the same strata provides a minimum estimate because of the lower taxonomic and higher stratigraphic resolution of palynofloral data (<A id=""xref-ref-30-8"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-30"">30</A>). Our integrated terrestrial and marine <mark>climate</mark> record should help to improve understanding of the fates of other groups of organisms at the K–P boundary by expediting the discrimination of climatic from impact effects on biodiversity.</P></DIV><DIV class=""section ack"" id=""ack-1""><H2>Acknowledgments</H2><P id=""p-31"">We thank K.

Increases in the strength, duration and frequency of southward incursions of warm, nutrient poor EAC water transports heat and biota to eastern Tasmania. This shift in large-scale oceanography is reflected by changes in the structure of nearshore zooplankton communities and other elements of the pelagic system; by a regional decline in the extent of dense beds of giant kelp (<EM>Macrocystis pyrifera</EM>); by marked changes in the distribution of nearshore fishes; and by range expansions of other northern warmer-water species to colonize Tasmanian coastal waters. Population-level changes in commercially important invertebrate species may also be associated with the warming trend.</P><P id=""sp0070"">Over-grazing of seaweed beds by one recently established species, the sea urchin <EM>Centrostephanus rodgersii</EM>, is causing a fundamental shift in the structure and dynamics of Tasmanian rocky reef systems by the formation of sea urchin ‘barrens’ habitat. Formation of barrens represents an interaction between effects of <mark>climate change</mark> and a reduction in large predatory rock lobsters due to fishing. Barrens realize a loss of biodiversity and production from rocky reefs, and threaten valuable abalone and rock lobster fisheries and the local economies and social communities they support. This range-extending sea urchin species represents the single largest biologically mediated threat to the integrity of important shallow water rocky reef communities in eastern Tasmania.</P><P id=""sp0075"">In synthesizing change in the physical ocean <mark>climate</mark> in eastern Tasmania and parallel shifts in species' distributions and ecological processes, there is evidence that the direct effects of changing physical conditions have precipitated cascading effects of ecological change in benthic (rocky reef) and pelagic systems. However, some patterns correlated with temperature have plausible alternative explanations unrelated to thermal gradients in time or space. We identify important knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to adequately understand, anticipate and adapt to future <mark>climate</mark>-driven changes in marine systems in the region.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""abstract graphical"" id=""aep-abstract-id46""><DIV id=""aep-abstract-sec-id47""><H3>Research Highlights</H3><P id=""sp0090"">► Intensification of EAC leads to large changes in marine systems in eastern Tasmania. ► Range-extending sea urchins pose significant threat to rocky reefs and key fisheries. ► Large-scale oceanographic change is reflected by change in zooplankton communities. ► Dramatic decline in giant kelp beds as a result of <mark>climate change</mark> in eastern Tasmania. ► Oceanographic change precipitates cascading ecological change in eastern Tasmania.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><UL class=""issue-navigation"" id=""issue-navigation""><LI class=""previous""><BUTTON class=""button-alternative button-alternative-tertiary"" disabled="""" type=""button""><SPAN class=""button-alternative-text""><SPAN><STRONG>Previous </STRONG>article<SPAN class=""extra-detail""> in issue</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></BUTTON></LI></UL></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

But when elevated temperature (eT) conditions are applied in tandem with eCO<SUB>2</SUB>, a more realistic scenario for future <mark>climate change</mark>, the positive effects of eCO<SUB>2</SUB> on nodulation and BNF in <I>M. sativa</I> are often much reduced. Silicon (Si) supplementation of <I>M. sativa</I> has also been reported to promote root nodulation and BNF, so could potentially restore the positive effects of eCO<SUB>2</SUB> under eT. Increased nitrogen availability, however, could also increase host suitability for aphid pests, potentially negating any benefit. We applied eCO<SUB>2</SUB> (+240 ppm) and eT (+4°C), separately and in combination, to <I>M. sativa</I> growing in Si supplemented (Si+) and un-supplemented soil (Si-) to determine whether Si moderated the effects of eCO<SUB>2</SUB> and eT. Plants were either inoculated with the aphid <I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I> or insect-free. In Si- soils, eCO<SUB>2</SUB> stimulated plant growth by 67% and nodulation by 42%, respectively, whereas eT reduced these parameters by 26 and 48%, respectively. Aphids broadly mirrored these effects on Si- plants, increasing colonization rates under eCO<SUB>2</SUB> and performing much worse (reduced abundance and colonization) under eT when compared to ambient conditions, confirming our hypothesized link between root nodulation, plant growth, and pest performance. Examined across all CO<SUB>2</SUB> and temperature regimes, Si supplementation promoted plant growth (+93%), and root nodulation (+50%). <I>A. pisum</I> abundance declined sharply under eT conditions and was largely unaffected by Si supplementation. In conclusion, supplementing <I>M. sativa</I> with Si had consistent positive effects on plant growth and nodulation under different CO<SUB>2</SUB> and temperature scenarios. These findings offer potential for using Si supplementation to maintain legume productivity under predicted <mark>climate change</mark> scenarios without making legumes more susceptible to insect pests.</P></DIV><DIV class=""JournalFullText""><H2>Introduction</H2><P class=""mb15"">Projected increases in atmospheric <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) have been shown experimentally to stimulate biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in legumes (<A href=""#B61"">Soussana and Hartwig, 1996</A>; <A href=""#B66"">Zanetti et al., 1996</A>; <A href=""#B24"">Hungate et al., 1999</A>; <A href=""#B13"">Edwards et al., 2006</A>; <A href=""#B35"">Lam et al., 2012</A>). These effects are strongest immediately after exposure to elevated CO<SUB>2</SUB> (eCO<SUB>2</SUB>) (<A href=""#B25"">Hungate et al., 2004</A>) and when other nutrients (especially phosphorus) are not limiting (<A href=""#B53"">Rogers et al., 2009</A>). Elevated CO<SUB>2</SUB> (eCO<SUB>2</SUB>) can promote BNF via several mechanisms, including larger numbers of N<SUB>2</SUB> fixing symbiotic bacteria in the rhizosphere (<A href=""#B60"">Schortemeyer et al., 1996</A>), increased numbers of nodules which house N<SUB>2</SUB> fixing rhizobia bacteria (<A href=""#B59"">Ryle and Powell, 1992</A>) and enhanced nitrogenase activity (<A href=""#B46"">Norby, 1987</A>). Broadly speaking, eCO<SUB>2</SUB> allows legumes to increase rates of photosynthesis and allocate more <mark>carbon</mark> belowground to support increased root nodulation and therefore BNF (<A href=""#B1"">Aranjuelo et al., 2014</A>).</P><P class=""mb15"">Researchers are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of testing multiple environmental change factors because they are predicted to occur concurrently and often have either synergistic or antagonistic impacts on one another (<A href=""#B52"">Robinson et al., 2012</A>; <A href=""#B31"">Johnson and Jones, 2017</A>). <mark>Climate</mark> models predict, for instance, that air temperatures will increase in tandem with increases in atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> and warmer temperature may negate any positive impacts of eCO<SUB>2</SUB> on plant growth (<A href=""#B45"">Newman et al., 2011</A>). This may be particularly true in legume systems because higher temperatures can have inhibitory effects on BNF due to the relatively low tolerance of N<SUB>2</SUB>-fixing bacteria to higher temperatures (<A href=""#B65"">Zahran, 1999</A>; <A href=""#B64"">Whittington et al., 2013</A>; <A href=""#B1"">Aranjuelo et al., 2014</A>). The optimal temperature for root nodule symbiosis for temperate legumes is thought to be around 15–25°C, above which detrimental effects can become evident (<A href=""#B1"">Aranjuelo et al., 2014</A>). Elevated temperature (eT) can directly hinder the development and functionality of root nodulation and accelerate nodule senescence (<A href=""#B47"">Piha and Munns, 1987</A>; <A href=""#B2"">Aranjuelo et al., 2006</A>). In addition, eT can inhibit nodulation via plant-mediated mechanisms, including reduced root hair formation, fewer nodulation sites and poorer adherence of bacteria to root hairs (<A href=""#B26"">Hungria and Franco, 1993</A>; <A href=""#B27"">Hungria and Vargas, 2000</A>; <A href=""#B1"">Aranjuelo et al., 2014</A>).</P><P class=""mb15"">Soil conditions play an important role in determining the extent to which eCO<SUB>2</SUB> and eT affect root nodulation in legumes (<A href=""#B1"">Aranjuelo et al., 2014</A>). Several studies report that supplementation of soil silicon (Si) levels promotes growth in legumes (<A href=""#B23"">Horst and Marschner, 1978</A>; <A href=""#B42"">Miyake and Takahashi, 1985</A>; <A href=""#B22"">Guo et al., 2006</A>; <A href=""#B30"">Johnson et al., 2017</A>), though we know less about the functional role of Si in legumes compared to other plant families such as the Poaceae (<A href=""#B14"">Epstein, 1999</A>; <A href=""#B8"">Cooke and Leishman, 2011</A>). Moreover, Si supplementation can increase rates of root nodulation and symbiosis with nitrogen fixing bacteria (<A href=""#B44"">Nelwamondo and Dakora, 1999</A>; <A href=""#B39"">Mali and Aery, 2008</A>). However, how these positive effects of Si on nodulation are affected by eCO<SUB>2</SUB> or eT, alone or in combination, have not yet been addressed. If Si could maintain nodulation rates under future <mark>climate change</mark> scenarios, such as eT, which usually decrease it, then such supplementation could be important in the mitigation of <mark>climate change</mark> impacts on agriculture.</P><P class=""mb15"">While rhizobial colonization promotes legume growth and vigor, this improved host quality can also increase susceptibility to belowground (<A href=""#B49"">Quinn and Hower, 1986</A>; <A href=""#B20"">Gerard, 2001</A>; <A href=""#B32"">Johnson and McNicol, 2010</A>) and aboveground insect herbivores (<A href=""#B10"">Dean et al., 2009</A>, <A href=""#B11"">2014</A>; <A href=""#B34"">Kempel et al., 2009</A>; <A href=""#B33"">Katayama et al., 2010</A>; <A href=""#B63"">Whitaker et al., 2014</A>). Beneficial effects of rhizobia on herbivores most likely arise through increased provision of nitrogen, which is frequently limiting in insect herbivore diets (<A href=""#B40"">Mattson, 1980</A>). Increased provision of nitrogen may, however, allow plants to invest in plant defenses with negative impacts on herbivores (<A href=""#B48"">Pineda et al., 2010</A>; <A href=""#B7"">Brunner et al., 2015</A>). While Si supplementation usually increases plant resistance to herbivores (mainly reported in the Poaecae; <A href=""#B51"">Reynolds et al., 2009</A>), it may also indirectly increase susceptibility to herbivores via increases in legume growth and nutritional quality (<A href=""#B30"">Johnson et al., 2017</A>).</P><P class=""mb0"">The objective of this study was to determine how eCO<SUB>2</SUB> and eT, acting alone and in combination, affected root nodulation and plant growth in <I>Medicago sativa</I> in untreated (Si-) and Si supplemented (Si+) soil. We additionally aimed to establish whether these factors affected the abundance and colonization success of an insect herbivore (the aphid <I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I>). We hypothesized that eCO<SUB>2</SUB> increases growth and root nodulation in <I>M. sativa</I> but eT negates these effects. Si supplementation increases nodulation, even under eT, and therefore maximizes plant growth regardless of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and temperature conditions. We hypothesized that aphid abundance would be positively linked to plant growth and nodulation, whether driven by Si supplementation or changes in CO<SUB>2</SUB> and temperature conditions.</P><H2>Materials and Methods</H2><H3 class=""pt0"">Insect Cultures and Plant Material</H3><P class=""mb0"">Four <I>A. pisum</I> cultures were established from a single parthenogenetic adult female collected from a pasture containing grasses and legumes, including lucerne, at the Hawkesbury Campus of the Western Sydney University, Penrith, NSW, Australia (latitude -33.608847, longitude 150.747016). Cultures were maintained on propagated lucerne (<I>M. sativa</I> L.) plants (Sequel cultivar) in each of the four CO<SUB>2</SUB> and temperature combinations (conditions below) for at least six generations (c. 7 weeks) prior to the experiment. For the experiment, <I>M. sativa</I> (Sequel) were grown from seed (Heritage Seeds Pty, Adelaide, SA, Australia) in glasshouse rooms receiving supplemental light (15:9 light:dark) under the same conditions. Plants were grown in 70 mm diameter pots containing c. 700g of soil excavated from the Hawkesbury campus of Western Sydney University (location as above). The soil is typified as low-fertility sandy loam in the Clarendon Formation (Chromosol) (<A href=""#B5"">Barton et al., 2010</A>), which has low bioavailable Si content of 10–17 mg kg<SUP>-1</SUP> (<A href=""#B30"">Johnson et al., 2017</A>).</P><H3>Growth Conditions and Experimental Procedures</H3><P class=""mb15"">Eighty lucerne plants were grown in each of four CO<SUB>2</SUB> and temperature-controlled glasshouse chambers (320 plants in total) using a fully factorial design of ambient CO<SUB>2</SUB> (aCO<SUB>2</SUB>; 400 μmol mol<SUP>-1</SUP>) and eCO<SUB>2</SUB> (640 μmol mol<SUP>-1</SUP>) at ambient (aT) and elevated temperature (ambient + 4°C; eT). aT was set at 26/18°C day/night representing the average daily temperature (November to May) over the past 30 years for Richmond, NSW, Australia (Australian Bureau of Meteorology). eT (30/22°C day/ night) replicated the maximum predicted temperature increase for this region within this century (<A href=""#B9"">CSIRO, 2007–2016</A>). Environmental conditions were monitored continuously throughout the experiment and temperature readings were verified with portable temperature loggers. To minimize ‘chamber effects’ associated with using four chambers, plants were circulated within each chamber every 5 days (apart from when plants were inoculated with aphids to avoid dislodgement of the insects) and chambers were swapped every c. 10 days by transferring plants between chambers and adjusting the environmental conditions accordingly. While this does not eliminate pseudoreplication, using this approach in these chambers has provided matching empirical results to fully replicated experiments, whether using multiple chamber replicates or multiple experimental runs (<A href=""#B29"">Johnson et al., 2016b</A>).</P><P class=""mb0"">Plants were irrigated with c. 70 ml of tap water (Si 3 ppm) three times a week. After growing for a further 2 weeks, half (40) of the plants continued to receive tap water (Si- plants or Si- soil hereafter) at the same intervals while the other half (selected at random) received 70 ml of 500 mg l<SUP>-1</SUP> soluble silica in the form of NaSiO<SUB>3</SUB>.9H<SUB>2</SUB>O three times a week (Si+ plants or Si+ soil hereafter). When plants were 6 weeks old, 20 of the plants receiving the Si supplementation and 20 of the plants receiving tap water (selected at random) were inoculated with two teneral adult <I>A. pisum.</I> White mesh (organza) bags (125 mm × 170 mm) were applied tightly around the rim of all pots confining aphids to their allocated plants. After 2 weeks, bags were removed aphids counted (including colonization success; at least one aphid being present). Plants were cleaned free of soil with water and the number of active (pink) root nodules quantified. Maximum rooting depth was also quantified to provide a rudimentary measure of nodule density in order to give an indication as whether changes in nodule abundance were a function of root growth or nodule density on the roots (i.e., nodules per unit of root growth). Plants were freeze dried for 48 h and weighed. Leaves were separated from the stems and ball-milled to a fine powder prior to analysis for Si concentrations.</P><H3>Foliar Si Analysis</H3><P class=""mb0"">It was necessary to pool foliar samples (2–3 plants per sample), giving nine replicates of each treatment combination (CO<SUB>2</SUB>, temperature, Si application and aphid inoculation). Foliar Si concentrations were analyzed with X-ray fluorescence spectrometry using the method described by <A href=""#B50"">Reidinger et al. (2012)</A>. In summary, plant material was ground to a fine powder and pressed into 13 mm-diameter pellets. Foliar Si concentration was determined using a Niton XL3t XRF analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, United States), for a measurement time of 30 s. Results we expressed as foliar Si concentration (as % of dry mass), calibrated against plant-certified reference material of known Si content (<A href=""#B19"">Garbuzov et al., 2011</A>).</P><H3>Statistical Analysis</H3><P class=""mb0"">Goodness-of-fit tests, using the ‘goodfit’ function in the vcd package (<A href=""#B18"">Friendly, 2000</A>), were employed to determine which distributions best described the data. Plant dry mass and nodule density were transformed (logarithm and square-root, respectively) prior to analysis to meet model assumptions and give residual diagnostic plots which fitted a normal distribution and showed least heteroscedasticity. Plant dry mass and nodule density were analyzed using analysis of variance with CO<SUB>2</SUB>, temperature, aphid presence, and Si supplementation included as fixed effects individually and in interaction with one another. Root nodule counts and aphid abundance were analyzed with generalized linear models with negative binomial error structures and log-link function using the same configuration of fixed effects as above. Aphid colonization success was analyzed in the same way but with binomial error structure and logit link function. Statistical tests of plant mass and nodulation were conducted on data collectively, before repeating the tests separately for Si- and Si+ plants since there were significant interactions between Si treatment and environmental treatments.

In Si- soil, root nodulation patterns generally mirrored changes in plant growth (Figures <A href=""#F1"">1A</A>, <A href=""#F2"">2A</A>, respectively).

Nodule density increased (c. +45%) under Si+ conditions and, like nodule abundance, there was a significant interaction between Si treatment and temperature, whereby negative effects of eT were reversed under Si+ conditions (Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary Table S1).

Aphid populations at eT were similar regardless of Si treatments. In short, aphid abundance was always lowest at 30°C and Si promotion of plant growth and nodulation was decoupled from aphid performance, such that Si+ conditions led to increased nodulation (and potentially BNF) without increasing aphid numbers.</P><DIV class=""Imageheaders"">FIGURE 4</DIV><DIV class=""FigureDesc""><P><STRONG>FIGURE 4.</STRONG> Impacts of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and temperature on aphid (<I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I>) abundance (number per plant) when feeding on <I>M. sativa</I> plants growing in <B>(A)</B> non-supplemented and <B>(B)</B> Si supplemented soil.

Even more advantageously, this increased nodulation did not increase susceptibility to an aphid pest at eT, which had previously been observed for Si-induced increases in nodulation at ambient temperatures (<A href=""#B30"">Johnson et al., 2017</A>).</P><P class=""mb15"">Aphid abundance was strongly suppressed by eT and this most likely explains why aphids did not benefit from increases in plant growth and nodulation that arose under Si+ conditions under eT. While aphid numbers often increase with higher temperatures via faster development and increased fecundity, this increase ceases abruptly over a certain temperature threshold because of the adverse effects on, for example, embryo development and maturation (<A href=""#B56"">Ryalls and Harrington, 2017</A>). This temperature threshold depends on species, aphid biotype, and geographical region (<A href=""#B4"">Awmack and Leather, 2007</A>). <I>A. pisum</I> has adapted to the warmer <mark>climate</mark> of Australia since introduction in the 1970s (<A href=""#B57"">Ryalls et al., 2013a</A>). Some populations are able to function at temperatures above 35°C, although their optimum temperature is said to be c. 20–25°C (<A href=""#B55"">Ryalls, 2016</A>) and temperatures above 28°C are likely to reduce aphid growth and development (<A href=""#B6"">Bieri et al., 1983</A>; <A href=""#B36"">Lamb and MacKay, 1988</A>; <A href=""#B38"">Mackay et al., 1993</A>). Aphid biotypes with certain secondary bacterial endosymbionts may cope better with higher temperatures, however, since there have been several reports of endosymbionts alleviating the effects of heat stress (<A href=""#B43"">Montllor et al., 2002</A>; <A href=""#B54"">Russell and Moran, 2005</A>; <A href=""#B12"">Dunbar et al., 2007</A>). To our knowledge, studies have not yet addressed how bacterial endosymbionts might change in response to eCO<SUB>2</SUB><I>and</I> eT but endosymbionts could partially facilitate adaptation to <mark>climate</mark> and atmospheric change (<A href=""#B62"">Sun et al., 2016</A>; <A href=""#B56"">Ryalls and Harrington, 2017</A>).</P><P class=""mb15"">Several studies using temperature gradient greenhouses have examined the impacts of eCO<SUB>2</SUB> and eT on legume performance, including root nodulation (<A href=""#B2"">Aranjuelo et al., 2006</A>, <A href=""#B3"">2008</A>; <A href=""#B15"">Erice et al., 2006</A>, <A href=""#B16"">2007</A>). These studies report a general trend for eCO<SUB>2</SUB> promoting nodulation, but only at the elevated experimental temperatures. This was probably because the elevated temperature range used in experiments (c. 24°C; <A href=""#B3"">Aranjuelo et al., 2008</A>) was still within the optimal range (19–25°C) for nodulation in temperate legumes, so inhibitory effects of temperature on nodulation wouldn’t necessarily have occurred (<A href=""#B1"">Aranjuelo et al., 2014</A>). When temperature was elevated beyond 25–30°C, root nodulation in <I>M. sativa</I> has been reported to decrease by 22% under ambient CO<SUB>2</SUB> (aCO<SUB>2</SUB>) and by 56% under eCO<SUB>2</SUB> (<A href=""#B58"">Ryalls et al., 2013b</A>).</P><P class=""mb15"">Despite increasing evidence that the effects of eCO<SUB>2</SUB> are often modified by eT, and <I>vice versa</I>, comparatively few studies manipulate both factors in tandem (<A href=""#B52"">Robinson et al., 2012</A>). In the present study we established that positive impacts of eCO<SUB>2</SUB> on plant traits were not seen to the same extent when eT conditions were applied. This study therefore lends support to the notion that, wherever feasible, multiple environmental factors should be tested (<A href=""#B45"">Newman et al., 2011</A>; <A href=""#B37"">Lindroth and Raffa, 2016</A>). Crucially, Si supplementation had consistently stronger impacts on plant traits across a range of environmental conditions and regardless of whether plants were challenged by herbivores.</P><P class=""mb15"">A counterintuitive finding of the study was that Si supplementation actually reduced concentrations of Si in the foliage. Si may have promoted plant growth to such an extent that Si became ‘diluted’ in foliage, or else had not had time to accumulate in plant tissues over the duration of the study. A similar trend in foliar Si was previously observed in this system however, associated with rapid plant growth, increases in root nodulation and synthesis of amino acids (<A href=""#B30"">Johnson et al., 2017</A>). In addition to any increased nutritional value, the lower concentrations of Si in foliage of Si+ plants may explain why Si supplementation did not increase plant resistance to aphids.</P><P class=""mb0"">Our results demonstrate conclusively the benefits of Si supplementation for root nodulation: root nodule abundance was always increased in plants growing in Si+ soil and other factors, whether CO<SUB>2</SUB>, temperature and aphid presence no longer had significant impacts on nodule abundance. The mechanisms by which Si is so effective at promoting nodulation are not well-understood, but could include changes in soil conditions, increased root growth (and potential invasion sites), higher abundance of bacteroids and symbiosomes, together with the synthesis of compounds that upregulate nodulation genes (as discussed by <A href=""#B30"">Johnson et al., 2017</A>). The increased nodule density reported in the present study tentatively suggests that greater nodule abundance was not merely a function of increased root growth. Further work is needed, but Si could provide a useful tool for mitigating some of the negative impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on crop production – in this instance maintaining nodulation rates of <I>M. sativa</I> in warmer <mark>climate</mark>s. Moreover, other studies suggest Si could redress negative effects of eCO<SUB>2</SUB> on plant–herbivore interactions. For example, herbivore damage to roots of sugarcane was exacerbated under eCO<SUB>2</SUB> conditions, but application of Si reversed these effects and stimulated crop growth (<A href=""#B17"">Frew et al., 2017</A>). Intervention strategies could include targeted application of Si (e.g., furnace slag), selection of plant lines that naturally take up large amounts of Si (<A href=""#B41"">McLarnon et al., 2017</A>) and remediation of soils deficient in bioavailable Si (silicic acid) (<A href=""#B21"">Guntzer et al., 2012</A>; <A href=""#B28"">Johnson et al., 2016a</A>).</P><H2>Author Contributions</H2><P class=""mb0"">SJ, JR, AF, and AG: conceived the experimental design; SJ, JR, AF, and AG: acquired and processed data with SH undertaking Si analysis; JR: analyzed the data and all authors contributed to the interpretation and drafting of the manuscript.</P><H2>Conflict of Interest Statement</H2><P class=""mb0"">The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</P><H2>Acknowledgments</H2><P class=""mb0"">The authors are grateful to James Stockdale for conducting the Si analysis and the 2015 class of the Invertebrate Biology (300918) unit for assistance in conducting the experiment.

These include taxon occurrence data for ecological modeling, as well as information that can be used to reconstruct mechanisms through which biota respond to changing <mark>climate</mark>s. The full potential of NHCs for <mark>climate change</mark> research cannot be fully realized until high-quality data sets are conveniently accessible for research, but this requires that higher priority be placed on digitizing the holdings most useful for <mark>climate change</mark> research (e.g., whole-biota studies, time series, records of intensively sampled common taxa). Natural history collections must not neglect the proliferation of new information from efforts to understand how present-day ecosystems are responding to environmental change. These new directions require a strategic realignment for many NHC holders to complement their existing focus on taxonomy and systematics. To set these new priorities, we need strong partnerships between NHC holders and global change biologists.</P></SECTION><P><STRONG>How the living world will respond to <mark>climate change</mark> is</STRONG> widely recognized as one of the most pressing questions for biologists today (<A reveal-id=""ref27"" data-open=""ref27"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">McCarty 2001</A>, <A reveal-id=""ref46"" data-open=""ref46"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Walther et al. 2002</A>, <A reveal-id=""ref44"" data-open=""ref44"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Thomas et al. 2004</A>), but research progress is often limited by a lack of long-term data sets from which to extract patterns and test predictions (<A reveal-id=""ref48"" data-open=""ref48"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Willis and Birks 2006</A>). Long-term data are required because biotic responses exhibit threshold effects and nonlinear dynamics (<A reveal-id=""ref1"" data-open=""ref1"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Andersen et al. 2009</A>, <A reveal-id=""ref22"" data-open=""ref22"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Kuussaari et al. 2009</A>), and because infrequent events such as floods or hurricanes might be critical factors controlling the distribution and functioning of ecosystems (<A reveal-id=""ref49"" data-open=""ref49"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Woodley 1992</A>). They are also necessary to distinguish signals of anthropogenic change (such as <mark>climate change</mark> and environmental change) from natural variability.</P><P>Over the past few decades, ecologists have been using data from repeated surveys, time-series stations, and other monitoring activities to study the biotic response to <mark>climate change</mark> (e.g., <A reveal-id=""ref10"" data-open=""ref10"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Eggleton et al. 2009</A>). Such surveys are the most powerful tools we have for finding correlations between biotic changes and <mark>climate change</mark>; however, the numbers of these surveys and their duration have been limited, and funding has often been intermittent. For many questions, data of this type are simply unavailable, and alternative sources of data must be creatively repurposed. Historical records provide a second source of temporal information on biotic change; these include diaries and memoirs, collection logs, official catch or hunting records, personal memories, ships' logs, photographs, and paintings and other images of landscapes or biota. Such sources recently have been mined for information in ways previously unexplored (<A reveal-id=""ref47"" data-open=""ref47"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Wheeler and García-Herrera 2008</A>).</P><P>Natural history collections (NHCs), held worldwide in museums and research institutions, provide a third valuable set of resources for <mark>climate change</mark> research (<A reveal-id=""ref38"" data-open=""ref38"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Pyke and Ehrlich 2010</A>). These collections hold billions of specimens collected over the past two centuries, each potentially witness to past ecological conditions and irrefutable evidence of historical biogeographic distributions (<A reveal-id=""ref21"" data-open=""ref21"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Krishtalka and Humphrey 2000</A>). These collections have evolved ad hoc in response to changing institutional collecting priorities. Most were assembled to serve research in taxonomy, systematics, and biogeography, and were supplemented by material obtained through the opportunistic acquisition of donations, rescue of orphaned collections, and purchase of specimens for exhibition. This history presents opportunities and barriers to the use of NHCs in research on biotic response to <mark>climate change</mark>. One advantage is that NHCs typically have broad taxonomic and geographic coverage, and often include material obtained through repeated collecting over long periods using a variety of methods. These complementary collections are usually held by multiple institutions and will require enhanced tools for discovery and integration. Existing NHCs can possibly provide a more complete sampling of biotic diversity than other sources; some examples of NHC resources are published systematic works and floral and faunal lists, unpublished reports, new survey observations, or new collections (<A reveal-id=""ref30"" data-open=""ref30"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Mikkelsen and Bieler 2000</A>). Moreover, study of NHCs can inform the need for new surveys and suggest areas to be resampled, information that is invaluable when resources are limited and the need for results is urgent (<A reveal-id=""ref13"" data-open=""ref13"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Guralnick and Van Cleve 2005</A>).</P><P>Collections constitute a unique source of material that might be critical to solving particular problems and that cannot be re-collected for practical or ethical reasons. Significant specimens might include extinct or endangered taxa (<A reveal-id=""ref4"" data-open=""ref4"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Bastos-Silveira and Lister 2007</A>), collections from primary habitats that have since degraded, or those that cannot be replicated because of economical or political restrictions (<A reveal-id=""ref12"" data-open=""ref12"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Gaubert et al. 2006</A>). The long history of collections also allows present-day researchers to study morphological, biochemical, and geochemical records of early or even preindustrial conditions (<A reveal-id=""ref31"" data-open=""ref31"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Miller and Waites 2003</A>, <A reveal-id=""ref17"" data-open=""ref17"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Hilton et al. 2006</A>). In addition, existing collections can function as sources of material for pilot studies or for integrated projects that would not be feasible if they were forced to rely solely on new collecting initiatives (<A reveal-id=""ref28"" data-open=""ref28"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">McElwain and Chaloner 1995</A>).</P><P>In this article, we briefly summarize the relevant kinds of information that can be extracted from collections and describe how to enhance the contribution of NHCs to understanding how the biosphere responds to <mark>climate change</mark>. A comprehensive review and analysis of much of this literature can be found in <A reveal-id=""ref38"" data-open=""ref38"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Pyke and Ehrlich (2010)</A>. We focus on the biotic response to <mark>climate change</mark> rather than the equally important use of NHCs as a source of proxy data to reconstruct past <mark>climate</mark> conditions. In our view, strong partnerships must be developed between NHC holders and new NHC users; we highlight some of the technological and cultural challenges to be overcome and the mutual benefits to be gained as these partnerships grow in the coming decades. Given the increasingly tight fiscal environment in which NHCs must operate, it is imperative that collection holders be proactive in maximizing their role and contributions in the ever more important field of <mark>climate change</mark> research. In this way they may demonstrate the continuing scientific value of NHCs to developing research agendas and open new sources of funding to enhance the contribution of NHCs to global change studies.</P><H2 scrollto-destination=""2846010"" id=""2846010"" class=""section-title"" data-legacy-id=""s1"">Collections as historical records of species occurrences</H2><P>An NHC specimen with associated data (locality, collection date, context, etc.) is an unambiguous record of the occurrence of a taxon at a particular place and time. Data backed by specimen vouchers are always preferable to nonvouchered occurrence records because specimens can be used to verify and update taxonomic determinations, especially when taxon concepts have changed significantly in the intervening years. Many studies of changes to species' ranges use historical occurrence records extracted from NHCs, employing data extracted from collections directly or secondary sources derived from collections data, such as taxonomic monographs and check lists or Web-served aggregated databases (<A reveal-id=""ref35"" data-open=""ref35"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Parmesan et al. 1999</A>, <A reveal-id=""ref45"" data-open=""ref45"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Tingley and Beissinger 2009</A>). Collections data need not be perfectly resolved to provide a crucial insight on biotic change, and repeated samples forming time series within collections are not always required to test changes in species ranges; some questions can be addressed with historical point records that demonstrate baseline conditions. For example, records from existing NHCs with detailed sampling information have been compared with data from resampling efforts to document shifts in the altitudinal distribution of small-mammal species in Yosemite National Park (California) between the early 20th and early 21st centuries (<A reveal-id=""ref33"" data-open=""ref33"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Moritz et al. 2008</A>), and moth assemblages on Mount Kinabalu (Malaysia) between 1965 and 2007 (<A reveal-id=""ref9"" data-open=""ref9"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Chen et al. 2009</A>). Historical occurrence records also can be used to determine whether an apparently recent immigrant species is in fact a longtime resident (<A reveal-id=""ref11"" data-open=""ref11"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Frey 2009</A>).</P><P>Data from past changes in distribution can be used to model future responses. Historical distributions and environmental data can be used to test ecological niche models, which may be used to forecast biotic response under different future <mark>climate change</mark> scenarios (<A reveal-id=""ref36"" data-open=""ref36"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Peterson et al. 2002</A>, <A reveal-id=""ref6"" data-open=""ref6"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Broennimann et al. 2006</A>, <A reveal-id=""ref45"" data-open=""ref45"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Tingley and Beissinger 2009</A>). These models are then run forward to the present to compare the resulting predictions with known current distributions. This approach was used to test models of butterfly distribution change in Canada (<A reveal-id=""ref19"" data-open=""ref19"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Kharouba et al. 2009</A>), integrating species-occurrence data from NHCs and other sources with historical instrumental records of environmental data. In principle, both the biotic and environmental data required to complete historical tests of ecological models can be obtained from NHCs if geochemical or biochemical proxy data are extracted from material held in collections.</P><P>Natural history collections can provide insights into extinction rates in response to <mark>climate change</mark>. Significant lags can occur between environmental response and distribution change; for instance, for taxa with long generation times, when long-lived adults are not sensitive to change but other life stages are affected, or when ecological interactions within a community result in threshold effects (<A reveal-id=""ref7"" data-open=""ref7"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">CCSP 2009</A>). “Extinction debt” is a result of this sort of response, in which drivers of extinction such as habitat change occur rapidly but declining populations persist for long periods before becoming extinct (<A reveal-id=""ref22"" data-open=""ref22"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Kuussaari et al. 2009</A>). An important priority for conservation biologists is to estimate extinction debt, but the empirical evidence required to do so is limited. Tracking the fate of species that suffered total extinction in the past can help researchers understand this type of biotic sensitivity to change. An intensive program of high-precision accelerator mass spectrometry radio<mark>carbon</mark> dating of specimens stored in NHCs showed that <mark>climate change</mark> led to complex range changes and fragmentation preceding the extinction of woolly mammoth, <EM>Mammuthus primigenius</EM>, and giant deer, <EM>Megaloceros giganteus</EM>. Each species ultimately contracted into a different final refugium where, after several thousand years, it finally succumbed to local pressures (<A reveal-id=""ref26"" data-open=""ref26"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Lister and Stuart 2008</A>).</P><H2 scrollto-destination=""2846014"" id=""2846014"" class=""section-title"" data-legacy-id=""s2"">Beyond taxon distributions: Records of ecological process from NHCs</H2><P>Collections are much more than just gold-standard occurrence records; specimens therein can provide a rich suite of ecological, morphological, and biochemical data. For example, NHCs have been used to test predictions derived from ecophysiological “rules” that describe correlation between body size and <mark>climate</mark> (<A reveal-id=""ref32"" data-open=""ref32"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Millien et al. 2006</A>). Likewise, researchers can test phenological reactions of populations to <mark>climate change</mark> (<A reveal-id=""ref34"" data-open=""ref34"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Parmesan 2007</A>). Classic studies of phenological changes such as the timing of birds' egg laying and migration, insect emergence, and plant flowering mostly have used observational data collected during the past 50 years (<A reveal-id=""ref27"" data-open=""ref27"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">McCarty 2001</A>, <A reveal-id=""ref42"" data-open=""ref42"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Thackeray et al. 2010</A>); however, NHCs can be used to extend observational data back into the 19th and early 20th centuries (<A reveal-id=""ref39"" data-open=""ref39"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Scharlemann 2001</A>). For example, herbarium collections have been used to test for changes in angiosperm flowering times (<A reveal-id=""ref37"" data-open=""ref37"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Primack et al. 2004</A>) and fruiting times for mushrooms (<A reveal-id=""ref18"" data-open=""ref18"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Kauserud et al. 2008</A>).</P><P>Shifts in diet can also result from adaptation to <mark>climate change</mark>, and these shifts are often documented by chemical analysis of material stored in NHCs. For example, an isotopic study of feathers from preserved skins of the rockhopper penguin, <EM>Eudyptes chrysocome</EM>, allowed the reconstruction of penguin diets from the past 160 years (<A reveal-id=""ref17"" data-open=""ref17"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Hilton et al. 2006</A>), revealing a shift in the trophic level of their prey diet. Similarly, genetic studies of historical collections can be used to estimate historical population sizes (<A reveal-id=""ref31"" data-open=""ref31"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Miller and Waites 2003</A>, <A reveal-id=""ref24"" data-open=""ref24"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Leonard 2008</A>). For example, genetic data from Pleistocene mammals have revealed massive <mark>climate</mark>-related fluctuations in megafauna population sizes (<A reveal-id=""ref3"" data-open=""ref3"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Barnett et al. 2009</A>).</P><P><mark>Climate</mark>-related changes in species interactions such as disease or competition can also be studied using NHCs. For example, a survey of historical collections has helped document the spread of chytridiomycosis fungal pathogens on amphibians—a range expansion with serious consequences for amphibian populations that has been linked to <mark>climate change</mark> (<A reveal-id=""ref25"" data-open=""ref25"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Lips et al. 2008</A>, but see <A reveal-id=""ref20"" data-open=""ref20"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Kilpatrick et al. 2010</A>). Similarly, herbarium specimens were used to document the age of populations of the invasive species <EM>Alliaria petiolata</EM> (garlic mustard) in eastern North America, and analysis of extant populations showed decline in production of allelopathic compounds (<A reveal-id=""ref23"" data-open=""ref23"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Lankau et al. 2009</A>).</P><P>New methods and infrastructures are increasing the payback from research using NHCs. Recent advances in biodiversity informatics are revolutionizing the distribution of NHC data as new pipelines are developed to allow automated integration of information, improving data quality and allowing sophisticated analyses of information from disparate sources (<A reveal-id=""ref14"" data-open=""ref14"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Guralnick et al. 2007</A>, <A reveal-id=""ref16"" data-open=""ref16"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Hill et al. 2009</A>). Aside from information technology, a broad range of analytical techniques are now available that could not be applied when historical materials were collected. Most important are advances in biochemistry and geochemistry that allow the study of DNA, proteins, isotopes, and the trace element composition of specimens. In many cases, technological development of methods has reduced the barriers to their use on museum specimens. For example, the growing ability to perform biochemical and geochemical analyses with very small samples has greatly reduced objections to destructive sampling (<A reveal-id=""ref15"" data-open=""ref15"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Hausmann et al. 2009</A>), and new imaging methods using computer tomography allow the visualization of internal structures without dissection of material. These advances help overcome issues associated with sampling limited or unique resources.</P><H2 scrollto-destination=""2846019"" id=""2846019"" class=""section-title"" data-legacy-id=""s3"">Challenges and opportunities: Increasing the value of NHC data</H2><P>Information associated with NHC objects is often incomplete, imprecise, or inaccurate. Because most collections have grown for reasons other than the support of <mark>climate change</mark> research, collectors might not have recorded significant information, or former curatorial practices might have allowed information to be separated from collections, with connections later severed by poor information management. In some cases, the links between data and collections objects can be re-created through historical scholarship; for example, studies of collections and other records have reconstructed more complete geographical and biological information on the specimens collected by Charles Darwin, now held in various NHCs (<A reveal-id=""ref41"" data-open=""ref41"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Sulloway 1982</A>, <A reveal-id=""ref43"" data-open=""ref43"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Thomas 2009</A>). Specimen label data may be enriched greatly through the study of associated documentation such as diaries, memoirs, collection logs, and expedition itineraries, which are often available in the archives of NHC institutions, but also may be available from external sources such as the UK Colonial Registers and Royal Navy Logbooks (<EM><A class=""link link-uri"" href=""http://www.corral.org.uk"" target=""_blank"">www.corral.org.uk</A></EM>). Direct linkage of these data sources to specimens using modern collections management systems will provide easy access to valuable additional data related to collections.</P><P>Furthermore, collections data need not be perfectly resolved to provide crucial insights on biotic change. For example, establishing the former presence of a species in a region does not require precise georeferencing or collection dates (<A reveal-id=""ref40"" data-open=""ref40"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Stewart 2007</A>). Although most studies of changing body size use highly resolved data, some analyses group data into broader temporal or geographic bins prior to analysis (<A reveal-id=""ref29"" data-open=""ref29"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Meiri et al. 2009</A>). Studies of distribution changes over the past century might require precise geographic information, but the exact date of collection might be less important if, for example, one were comparing only two intervals (<A reveal-id=""ref33"" data-open=""ref33"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Moritz et al. 2008</A>).</P><P>Collections are compiled from a broad range of sources, and will always contain inaccuracies and out-of-date information that can be a greater challenge than imprecise information. In some cases, errors can be discovered and fixed with further study, most obviously in the case of improved accuracy of taxonomic identifications through examination by experts. Analyses of DNA recovered from NHCs are now able to remedy some data quality deficiencies associated with both taxonomic identifications and provenance (<A reveal-id=""ref2"" data-open=""ref2"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Barnett et al. 2007</A>). In some cases, retrospective georeferencing can help discover mislabeled locality data (<A reveal-id=""ref8"" data-open=""ref8"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Chapman and Wieczorek 2006</A>). In many cases, however, some investment in the improvement of data quality will be required to apply NHC data to <mark>climate change</mark> research. Were it possible to start from scratch and re-collect the data required for a particular study, there might be value in taking advantage of the information already held in NHCs.</P><P>Natural history collections are often spatially and temporally biased (<A reveal-id=""ref5"" data-open=""ref5"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Boakes et al. 2010</A>). Large international museum collections with long histories of collecting tend to have a good spatial representation of material collected from around the world, reflecting past trade and colonial links. However, there is often a temporal bias in NHCs for specimens collected before the 1960s, which reflects the acquisition of large collections from amateur naturalists. Following the decline in popularity of amateur collections of specimens in favor of digital images, this source of material has diminished. International museums now must rely largely on external funding to finance collecting trips by members of their staff, which limits collecting by in-house staff and increases reliance on transfers of material from external researchers. In contrast, national or regional museums are becoming increasingly important as a resource of recently collected, well-documented specimens of national origin. This positive development is particularly noteworthy in countries with high biodiversity but less economic development. The Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad of Costa Rica (INBio; <EM><A class=""link link-uri"" href=""http://www.inbio.ac.cr"" target=""_blank"">www.inbio.ac.cr</A></EM>), established in 1989, is a good example of a successful national institute serving as a repository of national biodiversity information, with a collection of more than three million specimens. Development of collections and associated infrastructure in such regions has been encouraged through programs such as the Darwin Initiative, supported by the UK government (<EM>darwin.defra.gov.uk</EM>), which assist countries that are rich in biodiversity but poor in financial resources to meet their objectives under the Convention on Biological Diversity (<EM><A class=""link link-uri"" href=""http://www.cbd.int"" target=""_blank"">www.cbd.int</A></EM>). Biodiversity informatics networks and the digitization of collections objects have great potential to increase the level of expertise in biodiversity-rich countries by dramatically reducing the cost of transferring information from collections-rich countries holding significant historical material (for example, the Solanaceae Source; <EM><A class=""link link-uri"" href=""http://www.nhm.ac.uk/solanaceaesource"" target=""_blank"">www.nhm.ac.uk/solanaceaesource</A></EM>).</P><P>Even within collections-rich countries, local and university museums are often a repository of important regional materials that supplement the national collections and are a significant source of past distributional and phenological data. The importance of these collections may be overlooked by local governments and university departments, as they are often underresourced and the collections are allowed to deteriorate or be dispersed.</P><H2 scrollto-destination=""2846025"" id=""2846025"" class=""section-title"" data-legacy-id=""s4"">Unlocking the vault</H2><P>Identifying subsets of NHC data that, with additional investment, are most likely to contribute to <mark>climate change</mark> research is a goal best pursued collaboratively by NHC holders and <mark>climate change</mark> researchers. Each group has differing expertise and priorities to contribute. <mark>Climate change</mark> researchers can help define potential uses of NHC data, whereas curators can best elucidate what might be possible using existing collections. This process will probably require information about collections that may not be currently available, because collections from areas with high potential for <mark>climate change</mark> research are likely to be distinct from those used for taxonomic or systematic research, and thus are unlikely to have been prioritized for curation and documentation. For example, collections of large numbers of common taxa are often the most useful as time series for determining species-level responses to <mark>climate change</mark>, and destructive sampling is more acceptable for common, duplicate, and nontype material. Collections of common material are thus of special value for <mark>climate change</mark> research; however, they typically have been perceived as of low priority for acquisition or curatorial effort, or have even been identified as prime candidates for disposal. Similarly, unprocessed bulk samples may be ideal for ecological analysis, but these have generally been regarded as being of little use to museum researchers, which constitutes a failure to consider potential applications in <mark>climate change</mark> research.</P><P>Maximizing the potential use of NHCs in <mark>climate change</mark> research may require major reallocation of resources within collection-holding institutions to encourage basic curation and development of narrative data for collections previously seen as being of negligible value or interest. As a first priority, such collections need to be identified, and information about their size, condition, and completeness of data must be made available to the global change research community. Biodiversity informatics tools assist with discovering useful collections (<A reveal-id=""ref14"" data-open=""ref14"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Guralnick et al. 2007</A>), especially because material is very likely to be held by multiple institutions. The continued growth of federated data sources such as Global Biodiversity Information Facility (<EM><A class=""link link-uri"" href=""http://www.gbif.org"" target=""_blank"">www.gbif.org</A></EM>) will facilitate the compilation and use of integrated data sets.</P><P>One important outcome of making NHC data available over biodiversity informatics networks should be a greater ability to demonstrate patterns of collections use that are critical for attracting continued funding and for setting curation priorities. However, the very infrastructure that makes data conveniently accessible for global change research has the potential to jeopardize efforts to demonstrate the relevance of NHCs. When collections data from multiple data providers are merged into an integrated system, the contributions of particular sources can be lost. There is an urgent need to maintain the chain of evidence from data providers into compilations, not only to allow revised information to flow back to data providers (<A reveal-id=""ref16"" data-open=""ref16"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Hill et al. 2009</A>) but also to ensure a one-to-one mapping of data to specimens, which will maintain replicability of research data and help collections holders give greater support to relevant collections.</P><P>Most NHC institutions are seeking to increase their holdings' use in <mark>climate change</mark> research. Institutional priorities and collections management strategies should invite input from the <mark>climate change</mark> research community; collections development policies might require updating in response to new uses for collections. For example, collections holders might need to continually assess destructive sampling policies to allow more refined geochemical or biochemical analysis. Natural collections holders need to prioritize digitization efforts for collections with potential for <mark>climate change</mark> research. In turn, <mark>climate change</mark> researchers need to be willing to help identify collection curation priorities. Integrity and security of research collections would be improved if researchers were trained in curation and collections maintenance, and by the assurance that new data and specimens are passed back to collections holders for curation and wider dissemination.</P><P>Natural history collections should be dynamic repositories of specimens and their associated data. Continuing research produces new information about specimens that is most appropriately cared for over the long term by specimen owners. Data improvement might include taxonomic identification, georeferencing, preparations of material, or the products of geochemical or biochemical analysis. Curating this new information within the institutions responsible for the specimens helps to preserve the tight linkage between specimens and information required to track changing interpretations, which might otherwise be lost in the confusion of transient, project-specific databases. This is a challenge for NHC holders, who in most cases are not equipped to accept large volumes of incoming information. It is also a challenge for NHC users, who must devote resources to sending updated interpretations back to collections holders as research continues. The solution is to put clear structures in place, preferably consistent within and across institutions, and make adherence to those structures a prerequisite for collections use by researchers. Support for data mining within historical collections and collection sampling needs to be built into research project planning from the onset. In addition, taxonomic expertise is often overlooked in project planning stages, as are the resources required for curation of existing or new material.</P><P>Collections and supporting staff should be regarded as large-scale research infrastructures analogous to astrophysical observatories or advanced geochemical instrumentation facilities, and users of collections should expect to support this infrastructure. Data improvement will help establish the flow of new information back to collections holders. In our view, NHCs should be community resources maintained by a partnership of users and curators. There is a precedent for this kind of interaction in the archaeological community. In many regions, there is a legal recommendation or requirement to consider the presence of archaeological remains when planning new real estate developments. Preservation might include removing finds for conservation and storage in museum collections. The costs of this work are borne by the project developer. These laws have been a boon for archaeologists because they subsidize the accumulation and curation of new data required to advance science.</P><H2 scrollto-destination=""2846032"" id=""2846032"" class=""section-title"" data-legacy-id=""s5"">New collections: Building time series for the future</H2><P>As institutions explicitly devoted to the long-term care of natural history data, NHCs are the natural guardians of the collections and data resulting from the study of biotic response to <mark>climate change</mark>; they should position themselves to grow their collections of specimens and data as records for the future. Biodiversity researchers, industry, governmental and nongovernmental agencies, and citizen science initiatives are increasingly engaged in the species surveying and monitoring required to understand the biotic response to <mark>climate change</mark>. Collection curators should take advantage of this opportunity and build collections of physical voucher specimens to ensure taxonomic standards and provide proxy material for future research. However, assimilating the enormous volume of material that could potentially result from worldwide biological monitoring far exceeds the current capacity of collections holders. Priorities should be focused on those voucher specimens necessary to ensure taxonomic control for comparisons, and for new collections to extend both the time series and point collections held in existing collections. Emphasis might also be placed on biota and biomes that remain poorly documented but are likely to experience significant effects from <mark>climate change</mark> in the near future, such as polar habitats or tropical mountains. Coordination of the efforts of different institutions worldwide should also be a long-term goal.</P><P>Natural history institutions might consider adjusting their collections-acquisition and specimen-documentation strategies to emphasize this new use of their infrastructure and ensure that they are able to accommodate the data generated by <mark>climate change</mark> research. New collections should be sampled, processed, and curated following protocols that facilitate multiple uses without prejudicing unanticipated future uses. For example, many NHC specimens originating from historical sampling programs now have diminished value because they were split into taxonomic subsets without a record of the sample from which the subsets were obtained. Other samples were partially sorted but without records of which taxa were removed, rendering them less useful for multitaxon comparisons. Sample storage standards need careful consideration to maximize samples' potential for later analysis; in particular, curators should avoid the use of preservatives or pesticides that interfere with biochemical analyses, such as formalin and ethanol for wet collections, and mercuric chloride and naphthalene for dry collections. The potential utility of many existing collections is reduced by a lack of data on treatment history. Alternatively, small tissue samples could be obtained routinely from incoming material and processed and stored as required for biochemical analysis, while the remainder of the material is stored for traditional anatomical research. Even the physical arrangement of storage or organization of electronic databases can facilitate or hinder the use of NHCs for <mark>climate change</mark> research (<A reveal-id=""ref45"" data-open=""ref45"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Tingley and Beissinger 2009</A>). In many cases, collections are arranged in a taxonomic order to facilitate comparison of material for systematic research. In contrast, collections arranged by sampling locality or habitat are more convenient for faunal-level analyses. Collection storage and handling processes must be considered in the context of various uses by both internal staff and external researchers.</P><P>Adapting collections management procedures and accommodating large volumes of new material takes careful planning and will require institutional flexibility, but this is an opportunity to ensure continued relevance of NHCs to global change research. Collections holders need to set internal priorities with the aim of continuing to be essential resources for contemporary scientific questions. This essay focuses on <mark>climate change</mark>, but similar messages apply to other research areas in every aspect of biology. Museums and collections should be seen as part of the essential infrastructure of science, necessary for enabling research in high-priority areas. Evolution, systematics, and taxonomy have long been well served by NHCs, but ecology, biodiversity, conservation biology, and many other aspects of biological science could also benefit from greater access to the collections' data. Rethinking NHCs as centers for recording the biosphere's response to <mark>climate change</mark> will have broader impacts for collections-holding institutions as they continue to evolve.</P><H2 scrollto-destination=""2846036"" id=""2846036"" class=""backacknowledgements-title"">Acknowledgments</H2><P>We are grateful for the insightful comments of Robert Guralnick and three anonymous reviewers.

The aims of this study were to predict plant production responses to elevated CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations using the SGS Pasture Model and DairyMod, and then to quantify the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> scenarios for 2030 and 2070 on predicted pasture growth, species composition, and soil moisture conditions of 5 existing pasture systems in <mark>climate</mark>s ranging from cool temperate to subtropical, relative to a historical baseline. Three future <mark>climate</mark> scenarios were created for each site by adjusting historical <mark>climate</mark> data according to temperature and rainfall change projections for 2030, 2070 mid- and 2070 high-emission scenarios, using output from the CSIRO Mark 3 global <mark>climate</mark> model. In the absence of other <mark>climate change</mark>s, mean annual pasture production at an elevated CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration of 550 ppm was predicted to be 24–29% higher than at 380 ppm CO<SUB>2</SUB> in temperate (C<SUB>3</SUB>) species-dominant pastures in southern Australia, with lower mean responses in a mixed C<SUB>3</SUB>/C<SUB>4</SUB> pasture at Barraba in northern New South Wales (17%) and in a C<SUB>4</SUB> pasture at Mutdapilly in south-eastern Queensland (9%). In the future <mark>climate</mark> scenarios at the Barraba and Mutdapilly sites in subtropical and subhumid <mark>climate</mark>s, respectively, where <mark>climate</mark> projections indicated warming of up to 4.4°C, with little change in annual rainfall, modelling predicted increased pasture production and a shift towards C<SUB>4</SUB> species dominance. In Mediterranean, temperate, and cool temperate <mark>climate</mark>s, <mark>climate change</mark> projections indicated warming of up to 3.3°C, with annual rainfall reduced by up to 28%. Under future <mark>climate</mark> scenarios at Wagga Wagga, NSW, and Ellinbank, Victoria, our study predicted increased winter and early spring pasture growth rates, but this was counteracted by a predicted shorter spring growing season, with annual pasture production higher than the baseline under the 2030 <mark>climate</mark> scenario, but reduced by up to 19% under the 2070 high scenario. In a cool temperate environment at Elliott, Tasmania, annual production was higher than the baseline in all 3 future <mark>climate</mark> scenarios, but highest in the 2070 mid scenario. At the Wagga Wagga, Ellinbank, and Elliott sites the effect of rainfall declines on pasture production was moderated by a predicted reduction in drainage below the root zone and, at Ellinbank, the use of deeper rooted plant systems was shown to be an effective adaptation to mitigate some of the effect of lower rainfall.</P></DIV><DIV class=""journal_abstract""><P><STRONG>Additional keywords:</STRONG> CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration, C<SUB>4</SUB> species, C<SUB>3</SUB> species, pasture production, water balance.</P></DIV><DIV class=""journal-references""><DIV id=""Acknowledgments"" class=""journal-abstract""><H2>Acknowledgments</H2></DIV><P>The Whole Farms Systems Analysis and Tools (WFSAT) project was funded by Dairy Australia, Meat &amp; Livestock Australia, and AgResearch, New Zealand.</P><DIV id=""References"" class=""Journal_section_titlebold greylineTB"">References</DIV><P class=""Reference""><SPAN lang=""EN-GB"" style=""layout-grid-mode:line"">

In the Middle Ages, women made up about half the population, just as they do now. But we have records written by or about only a tiny fraction of these women—most of them nuns or aristocrats. The vast majority of women in the pre-modern era are simply silenced by historical circumstances: lack of literacy, lack of resources, shorter lifespans, lack of opportunity for self-expression, lack of role models, and so on. Though we might think that, in the modern age, we are immune to that kind of massive demographic silencing, we’d be wrong.</P><ASIDE class=""m-in-content-ad-row l-inline not-size-a not-size-b is-outstream"" phx-inline-ad-layout=""4f9a6660fd2e496e9cf65d2f66ca34d9""><DIV class=""m-in-content-ad not-size-a not-size-b"" data-class-rules=""[{&quot;sizes&quot;:[&quot;970x250&quot;],&quot;classes&quot;:[&quot;is-970x250&quot;]},{&quot;sizes&quot;:[&quot;728x90&quot;],&quot;classes&quot;:[&quot;is-728x90&quot;]}]"" data-ad-group=""outstream-0"" data-max-ad-reloads=""5""><PHOENIX-AD-OUTSTREAM class=""m-ad-outstream"" id=""ad-4f9a6660fd2e496e9cf65d2f66ca34d9""><HEADER class=""m-ad-outstream--header""><DIV class=""m-ad-outstream--legend""><SPAN>ADVERTISEMENT</SPAN></DIV></HEADER></PHOENIX-AD-OUTSTREAM></DIV></ASIDE><ASIDE class=""m-in-content-ad-row l-inline not-size-a not-size-c not-size-d is-outstream"" phx-inline-ad-layout=""9d95594591e44ebc8a502f8d02c4b484""><DIV class=""m-in-content-ad not-size-a not-size-c not-size-d"" data-class-rules=""[{&quot;sizes&quot;:[&quot;728x90&quot;],&quot;classes&quot;:[&quot;is-728x90&quot;]}]"" data-ad-group=""outstream-0"" data-max-ad-reloads=""5""><PHOENIX-AD-OUTSTREAM class=""m-ad-outstream"" id=""ad-9d95594591e44ebc8a502f8d02c4b484""><SECTION class=""m-ad-outstream--content""><DIV class=""m-ad-outstream--endcard m-ad-outstream--cta""><SPAN>Thanks for watching!</SPAN><BUTTON class=""m-ad-outstream--cta-button""><SPAN>Visit Website</SPAN></BUTTON></DIV></SECTION></PHOENIX-AD-OUTSTREAM></DIV></ASIDE><P>The Zika virus has, once again, reminded me of women’s fundamental vulnerability to historical silencing, a vulnerability born of a dozen other risk factors. Women are vulnerable to governments that get quagmired in political debates—perfectly illustrated by the United States government’s failure to allocate meaningful funds to the search for a Zika vaccine because the bill that called for the funding <A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-democrats-block-zika-spending-bill-over-exclusion-of-planned-parenthood-1467133283"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">excluded</A> Planned Parenthood. The swift spread of the Zika virus has thrown into sharp relief women’s vulnerability to ecological crisis. Unless a vaccine is found soon, the virus will eventually infect more and more women of child-bearing age, not just in poor areas in the global south, but around the world as well. The reason? <mark>Climate change</mark>.</P><BLOCKQUOTE tml-render-layout=""inline"" class=""l-inline""><P>The burden will fall disproportionately on women: Global warming promotes rapid viral spread, and women suffer disproportionately from the spread of viruses.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>As the <EM>New York Times</EM> recently pointed out in a <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/20/sunday-review/<mark>climate</mark>-change-hot-future.html?_r=0"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">terrifying infographic</A>, the number of scorchingly hot days per year is increasing rapidly throughout the U.S. An increasing number of scorching days means a lower number of cold days, and we need cold temperatures to get mosquitoes to die off at the end of the year. What all this means is that Zika—and other viruses like it—are likely to become a year-round problem for all of North America and, eventually, <A href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/02/zika-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change/470643/"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">probably the whole world</A>. Further, the burden will fall disproportionately on women: Global warming promotes rapid viral spread, and women suffer disproportionately from the spread of viruses.</P><P>One reason for this disproportionate suffering is that women are anatomically <A href=""https://www.cdc.gov/std/health-disparities/stds-women-042011.pdf"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">more prone</A> to contracting sexually transmitted viruses than men are. But viruses don’t need to be sexually transmitted in order to fall particularly heavily on women: Viruses affect children, and, therefore, throughout the world, when children take an epidemiological hit, women are left to serve as primary caregivers and pick up the pieces. (This is not to say that men don’t participate in their care, but simply that, in most of the world, the primary quotidian responsibility of keeping children alive falls to women.) When viruses rage around the world on the backs of different kinds of vectors, be they mosquitoes, mice, deer, dogs, corvids, or humans, children are inevitably a high-risk population for contracting the illness. In the case of Zika, of course, fetuses in utero are, in fact, the preferential tissue target of the virus. But in the case of many, many other viruses, high fevers and lack of medications to treat the infection make young children particularly vulnerable. Moreover, of course, very young children simply don’t have the immune systems required to fight off strong pathogens. As throughout history, when children are vulnerable, women are vulnerable, since women—not just mothers, but aunts, sisters, and grandmothers—tend to be primary caregivers.</P><P>Women are vulnerable not just to contracting viruses from their children, but also to <A href=""http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/02/07/federal-push-paid-leave-and-quality-child-care"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">economic losses</A> that result from days spent away from work when they’re taking care of their children. And it is not at all hard to imagine social losses women will incur in the case of rapid and wide Zika spread. As the spread of diseases becomes harder to combat, with fewer and fewer areas experiencing the cold seasons that tend to reduce global numbers of viral vectors, it may become increasingly prudent for children in particularly hard-hit areas to be kept out of school, thus avoiding the possibility of contracting viruses from classmates. Should this happen, women will undoubtedly resume their historical role of at-home teachers, but in this scenario would spend more time isolated from peers than they otherwise might—an isolation that, as Betty Friedan argued decades ago in <EM>The Feminine Mystique</EM>, leads to depression and dissatisfaction. In the specific case of Zika itself, the situation is darker still: Women who deliver full-term Zika-infected babies will have radically altered life prospects themselves, dominated by the agony of caring for <A href=""http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/microcephaly.html"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">a child who will not thrive</A>. We may be looking at a generation of children in which many are tragically disabled before they are even born, and thus at a generation of women whose social, economic, and mental well-being is nowhere near what it could be.</P><P>Zika is just the beginning. Increasing global temperatures will eventually wreak <A href=""http://www.who.int/globalchange/<mark>climate</mark>/summary/en/index5.html"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">unimaginable havoc</A> on the viral fingerprint of the Earth. Fewer vector die-offs, rising water levels that create habitats for viruses, migration into cities as rural areas become too remote and too hot to inhabit—all of these conditions combine to create a petri-dish planet, with conditions perfect for the proliferation and diversification of viruses. The current spread of yellow fever through Angola and Congo, and the realization that it may soon spread east and north on the backs of the same mosquitoes that carry Zika, should have us all petrified. Particularly, again, women: Babies under the age of 9 months are not recommended for <A href=""http://patient.info/health/yellow-fever-immunisation"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">yellow fever vaccination</A>, even though babies under that age are prone to severe encephalopathy complications resulting from the disease; pregnant women are discouraged from receiving the vaccine as well, due to the <A href=""https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5117a1.htm"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">possibility</A> of fetal complications.</P><P>This is not a situation we can allow to proceed unchecked. <mark>Climate change</mark> is not just about melting ice caps and drowning cities, though those situations are already frightening enough. It’s also about there being nowhere left to hide from contagion. It’s about the world’s vulnerable populations—here, I’ve talked mainly about women and secondarily about children, but it’s also true of poor people and old people—having absolutely no recourse.</P><BLOCKQUOTE tml-render-layout=""inline"" class=""l-inline""><P><mark>Climate change</mark> is not just about melting ice caps and drowning cities. It’s also about there being nowhere left to hide from contagion. It’s about the world’s vulnerable populations—including women—having no recourse.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>To prevent a human catastrophe, major governmental bodies—like the United Nations, the European Union, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—need to be devoting serious resources and attention to medical hot-spotting: identifying areas of new and dangerous contagion, and immediately devoting resources to combatting that contagion, rather than waiting to see if it will spread elsewhere. Because it <EM>will </EM>spread elsewhere, as we have learned both from the Zika example and, now, from <A href=""http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/31/health/yellow-fever-who/"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">yellow fever</A>.</P><P>No one is going to escape the coming heat. We need a new attitude whereby we treat local illnesses in far-off places as though our next-door neighbor has just contracted something lethal and highly contagious. We need to design vaccines and fast-track their production, not “just in case” a virus becomes a global problem, but because we should know by now that it <EM>will</EM> become a problem. Concomitantly, we need to develop medical and social infrastructures to help women and children, and fund those infrastructures we already have. For instance, in the U.S., Planned Parenthood should be equipped with Zika testing kits, and, globally, hospitals providing pre-natal care should be able to offer the kinds of anti-viral drugs recently shown to be <A href=""https://news.fsu.edu/news/science-technology/2016/08/29/fsu-research-team-makes-zika-drug-breakthrough/"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">effective</A> in blocking some of Zika’s physiological actions. If we fail to do any of these things, we are looking at a lost generation of women—and, quite possibly, many other lost generations of women thereafter.</P><P>This may sound hyperbolic—the idea that an entire generation of women could be silenced by circumstances—but it shouldn’t. Historically speaking, it’s been the norm, more than it’s been the exception.</P><P>In my field of study, women’s voices are largely erased from the historical record. Pre-modern women were too busy with domestic labor and childcare, too busy dying young in childbirth, too unlettered, too oppressed by circumstances, to make a voice for themselves. I would do a lot to have access to any record at all of the daily experience, feelings, ambitions, and ideas of the average woman in the Middle Ages. I feel that absence from the historical record perhaps more keenly because I myself am fortunate enough to have been born in New York City in the late 1970s—a place and time of possibly historically unprecedented freedom, as a female person, to express myself, to pursue my hopes and desires, to stand up and be counted in public, as a participant in the drama of the world. And now I find myself and my generation of women perched on an impossible precipice, where it is all too easy to imagine the rapid loss of that voice and that participation in the public sphere. A loss driven by the kinds of energetic, physical, mental, and social sequestrations that will ensue if we do anything other than everything we possibly can to combat global pandemics and the global warming that foments them.</P></DIV><FOOTER class=""m-detail--footer""><DIV class=""m-detail--meta""><DL><DT class=""m-detail--label"">Tags</DT></DL></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
