In the current study, fifty-four high-elevation lakes (754–2005m a.s.l.) were studied to investigate the potential influence of <mark>climate change</mark> on surface water acid-sensitivity.  Redundancy analysis indicated that the concentration of nitrate, dissolved organic <mark>carbon</mark>, and associated metals was significantly influenced by <mark>climate</mark> parameters.  Furthermore, these components differed significantly between biogeoclimatic zones.  Modelled soil base cation weathering for a subset of the study lakes  was predicted to increase by 9% per 1°C increase in temperature.  Changes in temperature and precipitation may potentially decrease the pH of surface waters owing to changes in anthropogenic deposition and organic acid production.  In contrast, increased soil base cation weathering may increase the critical load (of acidity) of high-elevation lakes.  Ultimately, the determining factor will be whether enhanced base cation weathering is sufficient to buffer changes in natural and anthropogenic acidity.  Mountain and high-elevation regions are considered early warning systems to <mark>climate change</mark>; as such, future monitoring is imperative to assess the potential ramifications of <mark>climate change</mark> on the hydrochemistry and acid-sensitivity of these surface waters.</P><SPAN class=""end-abs""><H4 id=""sec1"">1. Introduction</H4><P>It is widely accepted that changes in <mark>climate</mark> may significantly alter the biological, physical, and chemical systems of mountainous regions [<A href=""#B7"">1</A>–<A href=""#B5"">3</A>]. Their potentially dramatic response has been attributed to the pronounced rise in temperature (1.5–2.0°C during 1980 to 1995) in high-elevation regions compared with the global average (0.5°C; [<A href=""#B9"">4</A>]) and to the influence of changes in glacier, ice, and snow cover [<A href=""#B37"">5</A>]. Accordingly, mountain and high-elevation regions are considered as early warning systems, providing valuable insight into the potential hydrological and ecological responses owing to <mark>climate</mark> [<A href=""#B7"">1</A>].</P><P>A range of potential impacts on the hydrogeochemistry of high-elevation and alpine aquatic ecosystems have been reported. It has been suggested that altered hydrological flushing rates and residence times, and increased inputs of nutrients and other solutes may cause the acidification of surface waters [<A href=""#B86"">6</A>, <A href=""#B44"">7</A>]. Soil mineral weathering rates [<A href=""#B16"">8</A>] and the amount and duration of snowpack are also expected to vary [<A href=""#B28"">9</A>]. Experimental <mark>climate change</mark> treatments in regions of the Rocky Mountains, USA, have shown that changes in snow pack cover significantly influence the mineralization rate of both nitrogen (N) and <mark>carbon</mark> [<A href=""#B87"">10</A>]. These changes in nutrient hydrogeochemistry have been associated with altered plant community competition, species dominance, and their geographical range [<A href=""#B36"">11</A>].</P><P>The Georgia Basin, located in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, is dominated by four mountain ranges. Few studies have focused on the high-elevation lakes and catchments that scatter this region. One recent study [<A href=""#B69"">12</A>], however, indicated that these lakes () are sensitive to acidification and that 18% currently receive sulphur (S) deposition in excess of their critical load of acidification (CL(A)). The study also suggested that precipitation and the cover of glacier and ice significantly influenced the pH and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) of these lakes. Temperature and precipitation are predicted to increase in the Georgia Basin [<A href=""#B31"">13</A>, <A href=""#B66"">14</A>]; it is uncertain how the hydrogeochemistry of these catchments will respond.</P><P>Although it is difficult to predict the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on the hydrogeochemistry of high-elevation and alpine ecosystems, an attempt to understand the potential implications of changes in temperature and precipitation may aid in the protection (or rehabilitation) of these systems. The objective of this study, therefore, was to evaluate which chemical components of these ecosystems are significantly influenced by temperature and precipitation and how <mark>climate change</mark> may influence the acid-sensitivity of these high-elevation catchments. Potential changes in lake chemistry, according to biogeoclimatic zone, were assessed based on a recent survey of high-elevation lakes [<A href=""#B69"">12</A>]. In addition, weathering rates under increased temperature were estimated for a subset of catchments using the PROFILE model [<A href=""#B81"">15</A>].</P><H4 id=""sec2"">2. Methods</H4><H5 id=""sec2.1"">2.1. Study Area</H5><P>The Georgia Basin encompasses 48000km<SUP>2</SUP> and is surrounded by four mountain ranges: the Olympic Mountains, Vancouver Island Ranges, the Coast Ranges, and the Cascades. The area receives high levels of precipitation especially along the coastal regions as a result of orographic precipitation. Modelled precipitation amounts (Parameter Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) [<A href=""#B17"">16</A>]) range from 400 to almost 5000mmyr<SUP>−1</SUP> for the 30-year <mark>climate</mark> normals (1961–1990). The basin encompasses seven biogeoclimatic zones (regions characterized as having specific <mark>climate</mark>, soil, and vegetation communities): Coast Douglas Fir (CDF), Coastal Western Hemlock (CWH), Mountain Hemlock (MH), Interior Douglas Fir, Engelmann Spruce-subalpine Fir, and Coastal and Interior Mountain-heather Alpine (AT) zones ([<A href=""#B43"">17</A>]; Figure <A target=""_blank"" href=""fig1/"">1</A>). Air temperature within these zones varies greatly, with mean annual temperatures (MAT) ranging from 10.5°C in the low elevation CDF zone to −4.0°C in the high altitude AT zone [<A href=""#B43"">17</A>].</P><DIV class=""fig""><DIV class=""groupcaption""><B>Figure 1: </B>Location of the Georgia Basin, British Columbia, Canada (delineated by bold black line).

The lakes were chosen based on lithology, the majority of the lake catchments being dominated by the rock types of granodiorite and quartz diorite, both characterized by low buffering capacity and low mineral weathering rates. The elevation of the study lakes ranged between 754 and 2005m a.s.l. with 72% of the lakes ≥ 1000m a.s.l. The lakes were characterised by low conductivity (median = 6.0<I>μ</I>Scm<SUP>−1</SUP> at 25°C) and low base cation and nutrient concentrations (Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab1/"">1</A>), typical of the dilute nature of high-elevation lakes. Twenty percent of the study lakes had pH &lt; 6 and 24% had ANC (estimated as the difference between the sum of base cations and the sum of acid anions in <I>μ</I>eqL<SUP>−1</SUP>) below 20.0<I>μ</I>eqL<SUP>−1</SUP> (Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab1/"">1</A>).

Soil samples were air-dried, sieved to &lt;2mm, and analysed for particle size (sand, silt, and clay) using a Horiba Partica LA-950; soil surface area was calculated from particle size following Warfvinge and Sverdrup [<A href=""#B81"">15</A>]. Soil organic matter content was estimated as loss on ignition (LOI), which was determined by igniting samples in a muffle furnace at 450°C for 8 hours. Quantitative mineralogy was determined for site composited soil samples (, composite of plot and depth samples) by X-ray powder diffraction using a Siemens (Bruker) D5000 Bragg-Brentano diffractometer under the Rietveld method [<A href=""#B59"">22</A>]. The percentage of plagioclase (determined by X-ray diffraction) consisting of albite and anorthite was set at 65% and 35%, respectively, based on previous studies in the Georgia Basin [<A href=""#B75"">23</A>]. Weathering rate for each study site () was calculated using the PROFILE (version 5.1) steady-state soil chemistry model, which is driven by soil mineralogy, bulk density, mineral surface area, and moisture content [<A href=""#B81"">15</A>]. PROFILE has been widely used in Europe and North America to estimate weathering rates [<A href=""#B4"">24</A>–<A href=""#B83"">26</A>]. Model application and data inputs followed Aherne et al. [<A href=""#B3"">27</A>] and Mongeon et al. [<A href=""#B45"">28</A>].</P><H5 id=""sec2.3"">2.3. Catchment Data</H5><P>Catchment boundaries for the study sites were delineated from a digital elevation model (DEM: 1:20000, BC Ministry of Environment) using a geographic information system (GIS). Land cover data for each catchment were delineated from the 1:250000 Baseline Thematic Mapping (version 2, BC Ministry of Environment), which was compiled from Landsat 7 imagery. Catchment lithology was obtained from the digital geology map of BC (1:250000, BC Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources). Long-term mean annual precipitation (MAP) and MAT data were estimated by PRISM at a 4km by 4km grid resolution [<A href=""#B17"">16</A>]. The biogeoclimatic zone of each study site was assigned using a digital map of biogeoclimatic zones for the region (1:20000; BC Forest Service Forest Science Program). Future <mark>climate</mark> forecasts (i.e., temperature and precipitation) were taken from the CGCM2 model developed by the Canadian Centre for <mark>Climate</mark> Modelling and Analysis [<A href=""#B24"">19</A>] under the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) A2 scenario (continued population and temperature rise, increasing atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations [<A href=""#B49"">20</A>]). <mark>Climate</mark> forecasts were downscaled (400m by 400m resolution) to each study lake using the <mark>Climate</mark>BC model and obtained from Wang et al. [<A href=""#B80"">18</A>]. Annual average total (wet and dry) anthropogenic S and N deposition for the period 2005-2006 was obtained from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ [<A href=""#B19"">29</A>]) model at a 4km by 4km grid resolution.</P><H5 id=""sec2.4"">2.4.

Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to evaluate which lake chemical variables were significantly influenced by temperature and precipitation. Redundancy analysis is a multivariate technique similar to principal component analysis but explains the variance of the dependent variables by a linear combination of predictor variables [<A href=""#B58"">30</A>], and it has been widely used in hydrogeochemical studies (e.g., [<A href=""#B42"">31</A>–<A href=""#B53"">33</A>]). Variables that were not normally distributed were log-transformed to ensure normality; however, parameters that remained non-normal (primarily land cover and geology characteristics) were retained in the analysis due to the robustness of the RDA statistic and the importance of these parameters to lake water chemistry. Differences in lake chemistry between biogeoclimatic zones were evaluated to explore how the hydrogeochemistry of high-elevation aquatic ecosystems might respond to <mark>climate change</mark>, as these zones are characterized by different temperature and precipitation regimes ([<A href=""#B43"">17</A>]; Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab2/"">2</A>).

Although general circulation models provide valuable insight into future <mark>climate</mark> scenarios, precision in estimating temperature and precipitation is limited owing to the complex topography of mountainous regions [<A href=""#B7"">1</A>]. Furthermore, most meteorological stations in the Georgia Basin are located close to sea level; therefore estimates may be biased towards lower elevation regions [<A href=""#B73"">34</A>].

Therefore it is important to evaluate which chemical components of freshwater ecosystems are heavily influenced by temperature and precipitation. Redundancy analysis indicated that several chemical variables were significantly influenced by temperature and precipitation; two axes accounted for over 86% of the variance in the water chemistry data (Figure <A target=""_blank"" href=""fig3/"">3</A>). The first axis (accounting for &gt;62% of the variance) was dominated by <mark>climate</mark> related variables (i.e., air temperature 0.828 and precipitation 0.422). Modelled sulphur deposition was also heavily weighted on the first axis 0.718 accounting for anthropogenic influences (Figure <A target=""_blank"" href=""fig3/"">3</A>); however, because of its strong relationship with precipitation and air temperature it was classified as a <mark>climate</mark> parameter. Deposition is highly influenced by precipitation [<A href=""#B12"">36</A>, <A href=""#B22"">37</A>], with greater deposition found in areas with large amounts of precipitation owing to elevated “wash-out” or the “seeder-feeder” effect in mountainous regions [<A href=""#B86"">6</A>, <A href=""#B25"">38</A>, <A href=""#B35"">39</A>]. Similarly, higher temperatures influence the conversion of SO<SUB>2</SUB> to , thereby increasing the concentration in wet deposition [<A href=""#B12"">36</A>]. The second axis, accounting for approximately 24% of the variance, represented differences in land cover (e.g., forested area 0.469 and alpine area (−0.484)).</P><DIV class=""fig""><DIV class=""groupcaption""><B>Figure 3: </B>Redundancy analysis biplot for water chemical parameters in study lakes in the Georgia Basin, British Columbia.

It is important to note, however, that the two land cover types (alpine and forested), although treated separately from <mark>climate</mark> parameters, are significantly influenced by differences in temperature and precipitation. In general, low temperature (higher elevation) catchments are dominated by alpine land cover whereas catchments with higher temperatures have a greater proportion of forested land cover.</P><P>Biogeoclimatic zones within mountains are characterized by different vegetation, MAT, MAP, and soil properties ([<A href=""#B43"">17</A>]; Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab2/"">2</A>); <mark>climate change</mark> is predicted to alter the range and size of these zones [<A href=""#B29"">40</A>–<A href=""#B63"">42</A>] and influence the chemistry of high-elevation lakes. The 54 study catchments were located across three biogeoclimatic zones: MH, CWH, and AT (Figure <A target=""_blank"" href=""fig1/"">1</A>). Many of the chemical parameters that were strongly influenced by temperature and precipitation were also found to be significantly different between these three zones. The Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that , DOC, pH, Co, Cu, and Pb lake concentrations were significantly different between zones (Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab3/"">3</A>).</P><DIV class=""fig"" id=""tab3""><DIV class=""groupcaption""><B>Table 3: </B>Mean values of the chemical characteristics of study lakes in each of the AT (), CWH (), and MH () biogeoclimatic zones.  Chemical parameters that differ significantly are indicated by bold lettering.  Where differences lie is indicated by superscripts “a,”“b,” and “c” (e.g., elevation: the AT zone is significantly different than both the CWH and the MH zone; the CWH zone is significantly different than the MH zone).</DIV></DIV><P>The relationship between DOC and temperature has been reported in many studies [<A href=""#B89"">43</A>, <A href=""#B90"">44</A>]; DOC decreased significantly from the CWH biogeoclimatic zone (2.00mgL<SUP>−1</SUP>) through the MH zone (1.17mgL<SUP>−1</SUP>) with its lowest concentrations found in the AT zone (0.39mgL<SUP>−1</SUP>; H<SUB>2,54</SUB> = 27.53, ; Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab3/"">3</A>). Along with temperature, the RDA analysis indicated that DOC concentrations were significantly weighted on the amount of forested land cover within the lake catchment (0.589; Figure <A target=""_blank"" href=""fig3/"">3</A>). Most of the DOC in lakes is derived from surrounding soils or wetlands [<A href=""#B40"">45</A>]. Accordingly, lakes draining catchments primarily dominated by thin soils or bare rocks typically have low DOC concentrations [<A href=""#B23"">46</A>, <A href=""#B70"">47</A>]. The percent of forested land cover between the biogeoclimatic zones differed significantly and decreased from the CWH zone (56.4%) through the MH zone (39.3%) with lowest values located in the AT zone (0.72%; H<SUB>2,54</SUB> = 36.24, ; Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab3/"">3</A>).</P><P>Lakes in the AT biogeoclimatic zone will potentially have the most significant change in DOC concentrations as a result of <mark>climate change</mark>. Krannitz and Kesting [<A href=""#B39"">41</A>] predicted that tree lines will migrate upwards into the AT zone under future climatic conditions; some researchers have suggested that a 1°C increase in temperature will result in a 150–200m elevational increase in forested land [<A href=""#B60"">48</A>]. This encroachment into the AT zone may result in elevated DOC concentrations as a result of increased nutrient cycling [<A href=""#B28"">9</A>], terrestrial productivity, and leaf litter production [<A href=""#B32"">49</A>, <A href=""#B20"">50</A>]. Increased DOC in surface waters could lead to shifts in biological species composition [<A href=""#B52"">51</A>] due to changes in nutrient and light regimes [<A href=""#B23"">46</A>]. Changes in the DOC concentrations of the CWH and MH biogeoclimatic zones may also be observed under increased warming due to projected increased terrestrial productivity in the MH zone [<A href=""#B13"">52</A>] and decreased wetland area in the CWH zone [<A href=""#B30"">53</A>].</P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> induced fluctuations in DOC can alter metal concentrations in surface waters as many metals are transported to surface waters through complexation processes with DOC [<A href=""#B23"">46</A>]. In particular, metals such as manganese (Mn), aluminium (Al), Pb, Cu, and Co are highly associated with DOC [<A href=""#B10"">54</A>, <A href=""#B6"">55</A>]. Metal concentrations in the surface waters of high-elevation lakes in the Georgia Basin are quite low ([<A href=""#B69"">12</A>]; Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab1/"">1</A>); nonetheless, metals in the 54 study lakes follow the same pattern of DOC. Lakes located in the AT biogeoclimatic zone had lower levels of metals compared with the MH and CWH zones (Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab3/"">3</A>). Specifically, significant differences () in Al (H<SUB>2,54</SUB> = 23.39), Co (H<SUB>2,54</SUB> = 21.32), Cu (H<SUB>2,54</SUB> = 6.92), Mn (H<SUB>2,54</SUB> = 11.71), and Pb (H<SUB>2,54</SUB> = 18.49) were observed. Under higher precipitation and temperature regimes, the toxicity of metals to aquatic organisms could be enhanced [<A href=""#B84"">56</A>]. The AT biogeoclimatic zone may also experience increased DOC and metal concentrations owing to the significantly higher proportion of ice and glacier cover within the AT zone (6.87%), compared to the CWH (0.35%) and MH (0.69%) zones (H<SUB>2,54</SUB> = 16.91, ; Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab3/"">3</A>). Increased runoff from the melting of alpine glaciers [<A href=""#B44"">7</A>] has been reported in high-elevation lakes in the European Alps [<A href=""#B74"">57</A>] and increased runoff may further dilute lakes. Recent estimates suggest that, with increased temperature, glaciers in BC may disappear within the next 100 years [<A href=""#B79"">58</A>].</P><P>Surface water  concentrations were heavily weighted on the first axis of the RDA (Figure <A target=""_blank"" href=""fig3/"">3</A>), indicative of the strong influence climatic parameters have on the cycling of N in the Georgia Basin. Nitrate concentrations were found to be significantly different between the three biogeoclimatic zones with the CWH zone having significantly greater concentrations than the MH and AT zones (3.77<I>μ</I>eqL<SUP>−1</SUP>, 1.23<I>μ</I>eqL<SUP>−1</SUP>, and 0.68<I>μ</I>eqL<SUP>−1</SUP>, resp.; H<SUB>2,54</SUB> = 17.19, ; Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab3/"">3</A>). The influence of increased temperature and precipitation on N dynamics is difficult to determine as many climatic, biological, and physical processes govern the cycling of N in ecosystems and the expected time scale of such changes has yet to be determined [<A href=""#B61"">59</A>]. In the current study, statistical analysis of  suggests that temperature and precipitation play an integral role in the N dynamics of high-elevation catchments.</P><P>Park et al. [<A href=""#B51"">60</A>] in their study of watersheds in Northeast Asia found that  concentrations in stream waters were the greatest during periods of high rainfall. They attributed this finding to the increased wet deposition of N resulting from increased wash-out in precipitation, also supported by Williams et al. [<A href=""#B86"">6</A>, <A href=""#B85"">61</A>] in their study of high-elevation catchments in the Colorado Front Range, USA. Although not significant, in the Georgia Basin, precipitation differed between the three biogeoclimatic zones with the CWH zone having greater MAP than the MH and AT zones (3617mmyr<SUP>−1</SUP>, 3488mmyr<SUP>−1</SUP>, and 3218mmyr<SUP>−1</SUP>, resp.; Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab3/"">3</A>). Modelled N deposition, however, did vary significantly with the CWH zone receiving significantly greater deposition (10.4kgha<SUP>−1</SUP>yr<SUP>−1</SUP>) than the MH (8.48kgha<SUP>−1</SUP>yr<SUP>−1</SUP>) and AT (5.80kgha<SUP>−1</SUP>yr<SUP>−1</SUP>) zones (H<SUB>2,54</SUB> = 9.57, ; Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab3/"">3</A>). Changes in precipitation volume, seasonality, and N oxides () emissions under future conditions may potentially lead to increased N deposition and elevated  concentrations in high-elevation lakes in the Georgia Basin. However, in a recent report by Metro Vancouver [<A href=""#B91"">62</A>],  emissions are projected to decrease until 2020 but are then predicted to remain stable (at approximately 45kilotonnesyr<SUP>−1</SUP>) due primarily to increased marine traffic in southwest British Columbia.</P><P>Higher temperatures may intensify  leaching from catchment soils owing to increased rates of N mineralization by soil microbes [<A href=""#B22"">37</A>, <A href=""#B47"">63</A>]. Increased nitrification rates have been observed in the Catskill Mountains of New York under increased temperature resulting in greater leaching of  into surface waters [<A href=""#B47"">63</A>]. Several studies have suggested that increased  transport has resulted in episodic and chronic acidification of acid-sensitive surface waters [<A href=""#B22"">37</A>, <A href=""#B54"">64</A>]. In the Georgia Basin, surface waters in the AT biogeoclimatic zone may be most influenced by increased temperature induced  leaching because of its present low temperatures and low  concentrations compared to the CWH and MH zones.</P><P>In contrast, enhanced N assimilation by terrestrial plant life may limit  entering aquatic systems through soil leaching and runoff [<A href=""#B70"">47</A>, <A href=""#B61"">59</A>, <A href=""#B48"">65</A>]. Nitrogen is a limiting nutrient for terrestrial systems and if future projections of increased terrestrial productivity occur in the AT and MH biogeoclimatic zones [<A href=""#B39"">41</A>, <A href=""#B13"">52</A>],  export to surface waters may be alleviated by the increased demand by alpine and subalpine vegetation. However, when the demand for N is reached or exceeded,  concentrations in surface waters are hypothesised to increase [<A href=""#B85"">61</A>, <A href=""#B1"">66</A>].</P><P>Accurately predicting the response of N and DOC to <mark>climate change</mark> is arguably more difficult than other chemical constituents in surface waters because of the extremely complex interactions with biological, physical, and <mark>climate</mark> related systems. It is therefore important that increased monitoring and research be carried out in high-elevation and alpine environments.</P><H5 id=""sec3.3"">3.3. <mark>Climate Change</mark> and Its Influence on Soil Base Cation Weathering Rates</H5><P>Weathering rates in alpine and high-elevation catchments are typically very low because of their thin soils, low temperatures, highly resistant bedrock, and small catchment to lake ratios [<A href=""#B62"">67</A>–<A href=""#B56"">70</A>]. Water residence times in alpine and high-elevation soils also tend to be quite low, decreasing the contact time between water and weatherable minerals [<A href=""#B21"">68</A>]. Studies in the Swiss Alps have shown decreased weathering rates with increasing altitude [<A href=""#B21"">68</A>]. Similarly, a study by Mongeon et al. [<A href=""#B45"">28</A>] at 19 sites in the Georgia Basin suggested that weathering rates were the lowest at the highest elevations, owing to their shallow soils and low quantities of easily weatherable minerals. Similarly, in the present study, lake concentrations of Na<SUP>+</SUP> and silicon (Si; typically associated with weathering rates) were significantly different between the three biogeoclimatic zones. The high-elevation AT biogeoclimatic zone had significantly lower Na<SUP>+</SUP> and Si concentrations than the MH and CWH zones (H<SUB>2,54</SUB> = 12.51,  and H<SUB>2,54</SUB> = 10.01, , resp.; Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab3/"">3</A>), indicative of lower weathering rates. As a result, mountain lakes are typically very dilute and sensitive to <mark>climate change</mark> [<A href=""#B57"">71</A>].</P><P>Increased soil base cation weathering rates with higher temperature have been widely reported [<A href=""#B81"">15</A>, <A href=""#B61"">59</A>, <A href=""#B2"">72</A>, <A href=""#B82"">73</A>]. In the current study, PROFILE was used to estimate future weathering rates for the 11 high-elevation study catchments in the Georgia Basin (9 located in the MH biogeoclimatic zone and 2 located in the CWH biogeoclimatic zone) under predicted average temperature increases of 1.1°C, 2.1°C, and 3.4°C for 2020, 2050, and 2080. In all three simulations, estimated weathering rates increased from present day conditions, with total base cation flux estimated to increase by 9.1% in 2020, 18% in 2050, and 30.7% in 2080 (Figure <A target=""_blank"" href=""fig4/"">4</A>). The approximately 9% increase per 1°C in temperature is consistent with previous studies [<A href=""#B82"">73</A>, <A href=""#B11"">74</A>]. The importance of temperature on mineral weathering rates has been debated; while laboratory studies show a strong dependence on temperature, field studies are often obscured by other environmental factors that covary with temperature [<A href=""#B41"">75</A>]. Nonetheless, several studies have reported field-based temperature dependence on natural weathering [<A href=""#B82"">73</A>, <A href=""#B78"">76</A>]. In the current study, Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> was the dominant weathered element, followed by Mg<SUP>2+</SUP>, Na<SUP>+</SUP>, and K<SUP>+</SUP> (Figure <A target=""_blank"" href=""fig4/"">4</A>). This may be the result of the high concentrations of calcic-plagioclase in the catchments (average of 13.2%) which is considered extremely unstable and, as such, is easily weathered [<A href=""#B26"">77</A>].</P><DIV class=""fig""><DIV class=""groupcaption""><B>Figure 4: </B>Average PROFILE weathering rates for calcium (Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>), magnesium (Mg<SUP>2+</SUP>), potassium (K<SUP>+</SUP>), and sodium (Na<SUP>+</SUP>) for soil study sites () under present day and future <mark>climate change</mark> conditions in the Georgia Basin, British Columbia.

Moreover, the active mineral surface area is influenced by soil moisture and acidity [<A href=""#B72"">79</A>]. In the current study, other <mark>climate</mark>-related controls on weathering rates, such as soil moisture [<A href=""#B82"">73</A>, <A href=""#B71"">78</A>], could potentially offset increases due to temperature; however, soil moisture (on an annual basis) is not expected to change much under A2 <mark>climate change</mark> in the Georgia Basin given the increase in precipitation (Figure <A target=""_blank"" href=""fig2/"">2</A>). Higher temperatures will not only accelerate the dissolution of minerals from bedrock and soils [<A href=""#B75"">23</A>, <A href=""#B61"">59</A>] but will also promote the production of organic acids that can further influence base cation weathering rates [<A href=""#B67"">80</A>]. Predicted decreases in glacier, ice, and snow cover will expose greater proportions of soil and bedrock to climatic parameters and freeze-thaw cycles [<A href=""#B88"">81</A>, <A href=""#B64"">82</A>]. Recently exposed bedrock is considered to be extremely reactive and thus extremely sensitive to chemical weathering [<A href=""#B16"">8</A>].</P><P>In the Central Alps, Rogora et al. [<A href=""#B61"">59</A>] have suggested that the recent increase in solute concentrations of high-elevation lakes can be attributed to the increased transport of weathered minerals associated with higher temperatures, lower snow cover, and enhanced weathering rates. Greater export of base cations from catchments to lakes will alter the chemical composition of surface waters such as ANC [<A href=""#B15"">83</A>] and may modify the acid-sensitivity of surface waters.</P><H5 id=""sec3.4"">3.4. <mark>Climate Change</mark> and Its Influence on the Acid-Sensitivity of High-Elevation Lakes</H5><P>Determining how <mark>climate change</mark> will affect the acidity and acid-sensitivity of high-elevation lakes is difficult as other factors aside from <mark>climate</mark> parameters (i.e., land cover, lithology) play an integral role. A recent study on the acidity of high-elevation lakes in the Georgia Basin () indicated that 20% of the study lakes had pH levels less than 6 [<A href=""#B69"">12</A>]. In the present study, results from the RDA analysis indicated that pH was primarily attributed to climatic parameters (−0.967; Figure <A target=""_blank"" href=""fig2/"">2</A>). As such, differences in surface water pH between the biogeoclimatic zones were observed with the CWH zone having significantly lower pH levels 6.07 than the MH 6.45 and AT 6.46 biogeoclimatic zones (H<SUB>2,54</SUB> = 9.14, ; Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab3/"">3</A>).</P><P>The pH of high-elevation lakes has been reported to decrease with increasing elevation [<A href=""#B21"">68</A>]. The increase in pH with elevation in the Georgia Basin has been attributed to the lower levels of atmospheric (S and N) deposition at higher elevations as well as the decreased production of acidic organic anions [<A href=""#B69"">12</A>]. Modelled N and S deposition were greater in the lower elevation CWH zone and decreased significantly through the higher elevation MH and AT zones (H<SUB>2,54</SUB> = 9.57,  and H<SUB>2,54</SUB> = 17.25, , resp.; Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab3/"">3</A>) in concert with DOC concentrations. As such, natural acidification resulting from increased terrestrial productivity and organic acid production [<A href=""#B22"">37</A>] may play an important role, especially in the MH and AT zones. Furthermore, with increased warming, surface waters located in the AT zone may experience episodic acidification resulting from  inputs from melting glaciers and runoff from catchment soils [<A href=""#B5"">3</A>, <A href=""#B22"">37</A>].</P><P>It has been suggested that surface water pH and ANC in the Georgia Basin are significantly influenced by the amount of ice and glacier cover in the surrounding catchment with greater pH and ANC occurring in glacier dominated catchments [<A href=""#B69"">12</A>]. Glacial melt waters have been shown to be high in base cation concentrations [<A href=""#B92"">84</A>]. Increasing temperatures will alter the natural dynamics of glacier accumulation and recession [<A href=""#B34"">85</A>] potentially altering the pH, ANC, and CL(A) of these surface waters through the increased transport of base rich glacial melt waters. Another result of retreating glaciers and decreasing snowpack is the greater proportion of the lake catchments becoming exposed and, consequently, influenced by weathering processes [<A href=""#B61"">59</A>, <A href=""#B88"">81</A>, <A href=""#B64"">82</A>]. Higher temperatures and precipitation leading to increased weathering have been directly linked to the increased transport of base cations and other solutes from catchments to surface waters [<A href=""#B61"">59</A>, <A href=""#B2"">72</A>, <A href=""#B27"">86</A>]. Weathering rates in the Georgia Basin were predicted to increase under future <mark>climate</mark> conditions and such increases may alter the CL(A) of high-elevation lakes in this region.</P><P>The critical load of acidity was developed to characterize the sensitivity of surface waters to acidification from atmospheric deposition. It is defined as “a quantitative estimate of an exposure to one or more pollutants below which significant harmful effects on specified sensitive elements of the environment do not occur according to present knowledge” [<A href=""#B50"">87</A>]. In the Georgia Basin, approximately 18% of the lakes surveyed () received S deposition in excess of their CL(A) [<A href=""#B69"">12</A>]. Critical loads are influenced by <mark>climate change</mark> and previous studies have suggested that increased temperature and precipitation lead to increased CL(A) [<A href=""#B55"">88</A>]. Accordingly, the number of lakes currently exceeding their CL(A) in the Georgia Basin may decrease; the determining factor will be whether enhanced weathering of base cations from the catchment soils and bedrock are sufficient to buffer changes in natural acidity and anthropogenic inputs from atmospheric S and N deposition.</P><H4 id=""sec4"">4. Conclusions</H4><P>It is difficult to predict how the hydrochemistry of surface waters will be influenced by <mark>climate change</mark>. Temperature and precipitation are expected to increase based on the CGCM2 model under the IPCC A2 scenario. These increases may potentially result in significant changes in the chemical composition of surface waters in high-elevation regions of the Georgia Basin.</P><P>Biogeoclimatic zones are characterized by a specific range of temperature and precipitation regimes; based on the current chemical composition of lakes in each of these zones, changes in DOC (associated trace metals) and  will most likely be observed, resulting from increased terrestrial productivity and greater runoff originating from melting glacier and snow cover. Such changes could alter the pH of surface waters through the natural acidification process associated with organic acid production and by episodic acidification. Base cation weathering rates were predicted to increase under future <mark>climate</mark>. The greater flux of these elements into surface waters may influence the acid-sensitivity of high-elevation lakes in the Georgia Basin. The ratio between increased transport of base cations into surface waters, deposition levels, and increased acidifying components from organic anion production will ultimately determine whether lakes will continue to be susceptible to acidification.</P><P>Future monitoring is essential in assessing the sensitivity of high-elevation lakes to <mark>climate change</mark> both in the Georgia Basin and in mountainous regions worldwide. Increased monitoring efforts are imperative in developing accurate estimates of temperature and precipitation changes in these complex topographical regions and the potential ramifications of <mark>climate change</mark> on the acid-sensitivity of high-elevation surface waters.</P><H4>Conflict of Interests</H4><P>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</P><H4>Acknowledgments</H4><P>This research was funded both by the Environment Canada Georgia Basin Action Plan and by the Environment Canada Acid Rain Program.

The Committee reviewed and endorsed these two documents at its 30th session (Vilnius, 2006) (Decision 30 COM 7.1), and requested all States Parties to implement the strategy so as to protect the outstanding universal values, integrity and authenticity of the World Heritage properties from the adverse impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P style=""text-align: left;"">The Committee further requested the World Heritage Centre to develop, through a consultative process, a draft policy document on the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on World Heritage properties to be presented at the 31st session, and discussed subsequently at the General Assembly of States Parties in 2007.</P><P style=""text-align: left;"">Accordingly, a Working Group meeting, comprising several experts and representatives of convention secretariats, was convened by the World Heritage Centre at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris on 5-6 February 2007. The draft ‘Policy Document on the Impacts of <mark>Climate Change</mark> on World Heritage Properties’ was prepared following this meeting and reviewed by various experts, practitioners, as well as representatives of international organizations and the civil society.

In contrast, the estimated cost of adapting to <mark>climate change</mark> over the same time-period is estimated between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.</P><P>“<mark>Climate</mark> hazards are derailing government-led efforts to reduce environmental risks in Georgia,” said Levan Davitashvili, Minister of Environment Protection and Agriculture of Georgia. “This new project will provide increased protection for over 40 percent of Georgia’s population from fast-acting floods and other natural disasters.”</P><P>The seven-year <A href=""http://adaptation-undp.org/projects/scaling-multi-hazard-early-warning-system-and-use-<mark>climate</mark>-information-georgia"">programme</A> received a $27 million grant from the Green <mark>Climate</mark> Fund (GCF), $38 million in co-finance from the Government of Georgia, and a $5 million grant from the Swiss Government. The project will be implemented in close partnership by UNDP and the Ministry of Environment Protection and Agriculture of Georgia.</P><P>“Investing in <mark>climate</mark> resilience is good for economy and good for our people,” said Levan Davitashvili, Minister of Environment Protection and Agriculture of Georgia. “To date, risk management in Georgia has largely been reactive, rather than proactive. This has meant large costs to compensate the victims of floods and other natural hazards, the increased number of ‘eco-migrants’ leaving vulnerable areas, and higher costs for recovery. This project signals a paradigm shift centred around risk reduction, prevention and preparedness.”</P><P>The project will achieve its goals of deploying an effective nation-wide multi-hazard system by scaling-up of several projects and initiatives already creating positive impact in Georgia. One example comes from the UNDP-supported project, financed through the Adaptation Fund, that improved forecasting and early warning systems in the <A href=""http://adaptation-undp.org/projects/af-<mark>climate</mark>-resilient-flood-management-practices-georgia"">Rioni Basin</A>, promoted <mark>climate</mark>-informed development policies, and demonstrated concrete community adaptation action in the high risk areas.</P><P>Across the globe, governments are leveraging support from the United Nations Development System to improve <mark>climate</mark> information and early warning systems. In addition to the Georgia project, the governments of <A href=""http://adaptation-undp.org/node/2939"">Malawi</A> and <A href=""http://adaptation-undp.org/projects/green-<mark>climate</mark>-fund-building-resilient-communities-wetland-ecosystems-and-associated"">Uganda </A>recently launched new GCF-financed initiatives that connect <mark>climate</mark> information with poverty reduction, food security and improved livelihoods. With funding from the Adaptation Fund, Global Environment Facility and Green <mark>Climate</mark> Fund, UNDP supports a global portfolio of projects on <mark>climate</mark> information and early warnings to facilitate <A href=""http://www.adaptation-undp.org/projects/ldcf-ews-cambodia"">risk-informed public investment planning</A>.</P><P>“As Georgia moves forward to achieving its national <A href=""http://www.eurasia.undp.org/content/rbec/en/home/<mark>sustainable</mark>-development-goals.html""><mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals</A>, the <mark>Climate</mark> Action becomes a crucial priority to build the adaptive capacity the country needs to ensure <mark>climate</mark>-resilient development into the 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century.

 <A href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/244/text"" target=""_blank"">A spending law</A>, signed by Trump on May 5 and much welcomed by <A href=""https://www.rferl.org/a/georgia-kvirikashvili-trump-abkhazia-south-ossetia/28475046.html"" target=""_blank"">Tbilisi</A>, says that countries that recognize breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia’s independence from Georgia may not benefit from US foreign aid.
 
Nauru recognized the two regions’ independence in 2009, shortly after Moscow embarked on an apparent campaign to bribe small Pacific island-countries into acknowledging the statehood of Russia’s separatist clients. Two other Pacific states, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, later reconsidered.
 
Georgia tried a charm campaign of its own in Oceania to prevent the recognitions. With no resources to match Russia’s, it sent roughly $12,000-worth of medicine to <A href=""http://www.eurasianet.org/node/61921"">Tuvalu</A> and promised thousands of computers to the <A href=""http://theislandsun.com/waisisi-chs-receives-two-computers-georgia-government/"" target=""_blank"">Solomon Islands</A>. But Tbilisi could not top the <A href=""http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/191400/nauru's-port-facilities-being-upgraded-with-russian-aid-money"" target=""_blank"">$9 million from Moscow</A> that Nauru used to upgrade its port.
 
Nauru stood by its recognitions, along with <A href=""https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35766.htm"" target=""_blank"">Venezuela</A>, <A href=""https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1850.htm"" target=""_blank"">Nicaragua</A> and <A href=""https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3183.htm"" target=""_blank"">Russia</A>.
 
But with just 21 square kilometers and 10,000 people to its name, Nauru could be the most affected by the US ban.  
 
The country relies heavily on foreign aid, but most notably from Australia and New Zealand. Since the early 1990s, it also has benefited from financial and technical assistance (nearly $30 million) from the <A href=""https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27748/nau-2016.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Asian Development Bank</A>, to which the US is a major contributor.
 
It receives further support from other major US-funded institutions such as the World Bank and several United Nations agencies. Nauru also benefits from assistance that <A href=""https://www.usaid.gov/pacific-islands/environment-and-global-<mark>climate</mark>-change/coastal-community-adaptation-project"" target=""_blank"">USAID</A> provides to low-lying Pacific islands to adapt to the impact of <mark>climate change</mark>. 
 
As direct assistance to Nauru, the US provided 10,000-liter water-tanker trucks last year. The US also offers free rides for <A href=""https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/16447.htm"" target=""_blank"">Nauru’s law-enforcement</A> on US naval and coast-guard ships.</P><P>New Zealand’s media has written that Nauru may see such assistance vanish and, indeed, that’s what the wording in the new appropriations law suggests. But the US State Department has not yet, according to the law, published a list of the countries to be so deprived. Exceptions can be made for reasons of “national interest.”
 
“We are aware of this new restriction and we are still reviewing it,” a State Department spokesperson told Tamada Tales by email.  
 
The separatist authorities of <A href=""http://www.apsnypress.info/news/mid-ra-novaya-amerikanskaya-administratsiya-poshla-po-tupikovomu-puti-podderzhki-absurdnykh-trebovan/"" target=""_blank"">Abkhazia</A> and South Ossetia have called the American move regrettable.</P><P>No reaction to the US decision is available on the Nauru government’s infrequently updated website. A message to its <A href=""https://twitter.com/Republic_Nauru"" target=""_blank"">Twitter account</A> went unanswered.

Samuel J. Locklear III is no smelly hippie. He became chief of U.S. Pacific Command last year after <A href=""https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/03/allies-move-from-defense-to-offense-in-libya/"">running the maritime portion of NATO's 2011 war</A> against Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi.

We are on super typhoon 27 or 28 this year in the Western Pacific. The average is about 17.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">So the greatest threat in the Pacific region isn't a military one, despite the <A href=""http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/03/11/south-korea-and-us-begin-military-drills-as-north-korea-threatens-war/"" target=""_blank"">fresh provocations</A> from <A href=""https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/02/north-korea-geology/"">nuclear North Korea</A>; the <A href=""https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/07/china-plan-to-beat-u-s/"">Chinese missile buildup</A>; and the <A href=""https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/03/taiwan-radar/"">hardening responses</A> by the nations that feel threatened by both regional military powers. All this has right-leaning naval analyst Bryan McGrath shaking his head that Locklear's <A href=""http://www.informationdissemination.net/2013/03/admiral-locklear-jumps-shark.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+InformationDissemination+%28Information+Dissemination%29"" target=""_blank"">jumped the shark</A>.</P><P class=""paywall"">And yet Locklear's forces frequently have to respond to the <A href=""https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/07/spies-tweets-tsunami/"">destructive weather events</A> that are growing more frequent as the Earth's <mark>climate</mark> shifts.

But his point about the long-term consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> in the Pacific will stand. There's a reluctance in some circles to consider <mark>climate change</mark> a national security threat: the CIA last year shuttered <A href=""http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/20/c-i-a-closes-its-<mark>climate</mark>-change-office/"" target=""_blank"">its short-lived <mark>climate change</mark> office</A> after conservative legislators criticized it for <A href=""http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/cia-<mark>climate</mark>-center-spurs-opposition/"" target=""_blank"">draining agency attention and resources away</A> from more immediate threats. But as leader of the <A href=""https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/03/despite-contamination-navy-copters-keep-aiding-japan/"">response agency of first resort</A> in the entire area, Locklear isn't drawing any such distinctions.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Sutter, CNN</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""interactive-container marshall-islands""><P class=""cover-photo-credit"">Cover photo: DigitalGlobe</P><P class=""editors-note"">Editor's note: CNN columnist <A href=""https://www.cnn.com/profiles/john-d-sutter"">John D.

You can shape this coverage.</P><P class=""dateline"">Majuro, Marshall Islands (CNN)</P><P class=""paragraph intro""><SPAN class=""dropcap"">A</SPAN>ngie Hepisus heard her nephew, Mark, banging on the door and screaming in Marshallese.</P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;It's flooding! It's flooding! Get out!&quot; </P><P class=""paragraph"">Her thoughts went immediately to her family on this fragile coastline in the middle of the Pacific, a place under increasing threat from <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><DIV class=""story-element expandable""><DIV class=""element-caption""><P>The Marshall Islands is a collection of 29 atolls and five islands, located between Hawaii and Australia.</P></DIV></DIV><P class=""paragraph"">One of her cousins woke up that morning last spring to find herself floating, her plywood home filling up like an aquarium. Another, who lives in a house where the roof is held down by evenly spaced rocks, was so bewildered by the rush of water that had invaded her house at 4 a.m. that she actually licked her arm to be sure that, yes, this was saltwater, and, no, she wasn't having a nightmare. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Then there was Jitiam, her wild-haired nephew, who was trying to tie his family's pigs to a tree trunk to prevent them from washing away. And Roselinta, who was sleeping with her 2-year-old son, Shiro, in a house that was being carried inland by the storm and the unusually high tide that accompanied it. </P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;My mind and my heart were pounding,&quot; Angie told me. </P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;It's like: not again.&quot; </P><P class=""paragraph"">She grabbed the Bible and all the family members she could. </P><P class=""paragraph"">They waded out into the dark.</P><P class=""paragraph"">Out here in the middle of the Pacific, somewhere between Australia and Hawaii, there's a place where no one has the luxury of denying the existence of <mark>climate change</mark>. People here in the Marshall Islands are living it. Have been living it. </P><P class=""paragraph"">They've internalized the gravest of predictions -- that the Marshall Islands, this loose collection of no-elevation coral atolls, likely will be submerged beneath the waves as humans continue to warm the atmosphere and the oceans continue to rise. They've seen their homes flood frequently -- seen the tides getting higher, seen their lives threatened. Mojje Anungar watched the remains of his infant son, George, who died at 7 months, wash into the Pacific from a coastal graveyard. </P><DIV class=""story-element full width""><H3 class=""video"">Video: <mark>Climate</mark> migration</H3></DIV><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;I'm still shell-shocked,&quot; he told me through an interpreter. &quot;Before, this kind of thing never happened.&quot; </P><P class=""paragraph"">A few people already are making the difficult decision to leave this country, in part because of the frequency of floods and the threat of <mark>climate change</mark>; and I found some of them seeking refuge in the most unexpected of places.</P><P class=""paragraph"">In the nine days I spent in Majuro, the crescent-shaped capital of the Marshall Islands, I learned there is nowhere on these islands to escape the floods. People, I was told, seek shelter on the second stories of buildings, or by climbing up the trunks of coconut trees. The only &quot;hill&quot; to speak of in Majuro is a bridge that's built over an inlet.</P><P class=""paragraph"">Perhaps nowhere is the precarious nature of this country's geography more apparent than Rita, a crowded neighborhood at the very tip of Majuro. That's where Angie and her family live, where they faced the &quot;inundation event&quot; last spring. </P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;I don't think these islands are going to last that long,&quot; Angie told me. </P><DIV class=""story-element factbox""><H3>Disappearing country, disappearing stories</H3><P>I documented my journey to the Marshall Islands on Snapchat, which is a social network for disappearing stories. Below you'll find a few examples of what will be lost if this country is submerged by rising seas.</P></DIV><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;Once a big tide comes, we're all going to be washed away.&quot; </P><P class=""paragraph"">For Angie and her family, the March 2014 storm felt like the beginning of the end -- like the ocean, always an ally and friend, finally had turned on them.</P><H3>'Seeing is believing'</H3><P class=""paragraph"">It's disturbingly easy to write off a country you've never seen. </P><P class=""paragraph"">I didn't realize that until I visited the Marshall Islands -- until I watched five hours of sapphire ocean pass beneath my airplane window between Honolulu and Majuro, completely unable to pull my eyes from the wet infinity below. </P><P class=""paragraph"">No boats, no land. Only water -- salt-speck waves cresting on a backdrop of blue; clouds casting coffee-stain shadows on the surface of the Pacific. </P><P class=""paragraph"">I felt my chest tighten up. </P><P class=""paragraph"">All this nothing. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Where was this freaking place? </P><P class=""paragraph"">The answer offered little comfort. Majuro appeared as a delicate necklace of land draped around a turquoise lagoon -- some of it barely wider than an airport runway. I'd read plenty about the Marshall Islands before hopping on a plane in Atlanta 31 hours earlier. But none of it prepared me for the sight of this tiny little atoll -- this coke-line of sand and palm -- tossed out in the middle of the terrifying sea.</P><P class=""paragraph"">No wonder this place is at risk for <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P class=""paragraph"">It's barely treading water. </P><P class=""paragraph"">I embarked on this journey to the middle of nowhere because CNN readers voted for me to look into &quot;<mark>climate</mark> refugees&quot; as part of my Two° series on <mark>climate change</mark>. That idea came in the form of a question from Kelly, a 48-year-old reader in San Jose, California, who asked, &quot;What happens if thousands or tens of thousands are displaced due to rising sea levels or desertification? Where do they go?&quot;</P><P class=""paragraph"">More than 11,000 voted in a poll that commissioned this story. </P><P class=""paragraph"">As the results came in, I started searching for a suitable case study. There are countries like Bangladesh where millions likely will be displaced by rising seas. But <A href=""https://www.refintl.org/who-we-are/staff"" target=""_blank"">Alice Thomas</A>, from Refugees International, drew my attention to low-lying island nations that could vanish if seas rise as much as 1 or 2 meters. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Kiribati, the Maldives, the Marshall Islands. </P><P class=""paragraph"">All of these barely peek out over the surface of the ocean.  </P><P class=""paragraph"">And all of them literally could be wiped off the map.</P><P class=""paragraph"">That's not an immediate prospect -- definitely not five years or 10. Even 20. But it could happen within our lifetimes, and certainly within the next generation's. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Scientists say we easily could warm the atmosphere by 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century -- and if you call up a scientist like <A href=""https://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/"" target=""_blank"">Stefan Rahmstorf</A>, a professor of ocean physics from Germany's Potsdam University, he'll say ominous things like this: &quot;Even limiting warming to 2 degrees, in my view, will still commit some island nations and coastal cities to drowning.&quot; In other words: See ya, Marshall Islands. </P><P class=""paragraph"">The tone is almost nonchalant. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Not because he doesn't care; he does. But because he says this stuff so often -- and I hear this stuff so often -- that it almost starts to seem expected. Easy to intellectualize. As if an entire country, culture, history and language are logical externalities of our fossil fuel addiction. Oh yeah, drowning islands. Heard that story. </P><P class=""paragraph"">It's quite another thing, however, to walk down the tarmac in Majuro. </P><DIV class=""story-element expandable""><DIV class=""element-caption""><P>Many coral atolls in the remote Pacific just barely peek out above sea level, making them particularly vulnerable to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P></DIV></DIV><P class=""paragraph"">There you see the broken sea wall, crumbled by floods that, in recent years, covered the runways and shut down the airport temporarily. You see sand piled up along the road, as if pleading with the ocean to stay back. You feel the thick air, warm silk on your skin. You wipe the fog off your glasses. And you take in the sweet smell of the ocean -- all brine and crab and palm frond. </P><P class=""paragraph"">If you're lucky, you meet <A href=""https://www.un.int/marshallislands/staff/amatlain-elizabeth-kabua"" target=""_blank"">Amatlain Kabua</A>, a Marshallese princess, former ambassador to the United Nations, and daughter of this country's first president. She met me at the plane -- threw a lei around my neck, a loop of fragrant yellow flowers she picked herself. She welcomed me with a Marshallese word that is as ubiquitous as it is magical. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Iakwe. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Meaning: &quot;Hello,&quot; &quot;I love you,&quot; and &quot;You are a rainbow.&quot;</P><P class=""paragraph"">How could you not love this place? </P><P class=""paragraph"">Amatlain insisted that I sit down, have some coconut milk (right from the coconut, but with a straw, because, well, this is 2015) and hear about her country's &quot;existential fight&quot; to convince the world that this place, these people, exist -- and that they matter enough to blunt the force of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P class=""paragraph""><mark>Climate change</mark> is real, she said. </P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;Seeing is believing.&quot; </P><P class=""paragraph"">I'd learn she was right.</P><P class=""paragraph"">Because, when you're standing all the way out here, you have to wonder: How could this place -- this charming, sweaty, smelly place -- vanish? </P><P class=""paragraph"">Or, more accurately: How could we make it vanish? </P><H3>'The melody of it has changed'</H3><P class=""paragraph"">The biggest flood was more than a year ago but she still doesn't sleep.</P><P class=""paragraph"">Is it high tide? King tide? Any chance for a swell? </P><P class=""paragraph"">Angie Hepisus checks tide and weather apps constantly, and wakes her husband, Timothy, to be sure she hasn't missed something critical. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Outside, the ocean laps at the land -- only paces from her bedroom wall. </P><P class=""paragraph"">She hears it out there, churning like a washing machine. </P><P class=""paragraph"">She's not able to let her guard down, unable to find peace. </P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;The sound of the ocean, it (used to put) me to sleep. It's like my lullaby,&quot; Angie told me. &quot;Now, it's more like slamming and hammering. It's so noisy. It scares me at night. ... It's changed. The melody of it has changed.</P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;It's not the same song I used to love.&quot;</P><P class=""paragraph"">The 44-year-old grew up in the teal concrete house at the edge of the land -- she, her 16 siblings and their parents, all living under one roof. Marshallese families aren't bound by terms like &quot;nuclear,&quot; so it isn't uncommon for a gaggle of cousins, aunties, nephews and great uncles to live together as well. It makes sense when you know how the land -- the precious little land -- is handled. All of it is owned by several chiefs, and it's managed on behalf of the family community. People here mostly don't pay rent; they ask for room to build on the family land and it's granted, free. Land rights are passed down from a mother to her children. So this plot of land on the coast in Rita is not just any place; it's a family heirloom, a part of their identity.</P><DIV class=""story-element full width""><DIV class=""element-caption""><P>Ukulele music is everywhere in the Marshall Islands. The instrument here has three of the usual four strings.</P></DIV></DIV><P class=""paragraph"">Angie is the third youngest of the 17 children, and the youngest girl. But she's the acting matriarch, ensuring that dozens of family members, many of them living on this precarious stretch of coastline, are fed, clothed and kept safe. She's also the family historian, safeguarding and updating documents pertaining to the family's royal heritage and their land here in Rita and elsewhere. </P><P class=""paragraph"">These are her responsibilities for perhaps three reasons. First, she's bossy as hell. As a kid, Angie's siblings nicknamed her &quot;big eyes&quot; and &quot;reporter,&quot; because she saw what other family members were doing wrong, and was quick to tattle. Her world is one of right and wrong, and she'll certainly tell you if you're wrong. Second, she has arguably the best, most stable job of her siblings, working as an executive assistant at the Bank of Marshall Islands in Majuro. And, finally, and most importantly, she's here. </P><P class=""paragraph"">The others are not. </P><P class=""paragraph"">The house where Roselinta and her 2-year-old lived before the flood? What remains is a slab of concrete. Mark, the nephew who woke her as the waters were rising? Jitiam, who was trying to tie up the pigs before they washed away?</P><P class=""paragraph"">They are gone.</P><H3>'We are not a small island country'</H3><P class=""paragraph"">I spent much of my time in the Marshall Islands trying to figure out what will be lost if we let this country drown beneath the rising ocean. I decided to document these wanderings on Snapchat, an app for stories that vanish after you view them. </P><P class=""paragraph"">I called them disappearing stories from a disappearing country.</P><P class=""paragraph"">Annoyingly meta, I know. </P><P class=""paragraph"">A premise for my findings: To really get the Marshall Islands, you need to understand that this is a country that's far more water than land. The total area of the country, including the Pacific Ocean, is nearly three times that of Texas. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Subtract the ocean and you're left with land that would fill Washington, D.C.</P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;We are not a small island country. We are a big ocean country -- with a conscience that we'd like to share,&quot; said <A href=""https://twitter.com/ministertdb"" target=""_blank"">Tony de Brum</A>, the foreign minister.</P><P class=""paragraph"">The first people are thought to have arrived in the Marshall Islands 2,000 to 3,000 years ago, likely coming by canoe from Southeast Asia. Think about that. A voyage across the Pacific by outrigger canoe. That's the kind of thing that just doesn't happen in the SpaceX era -- well, unless you're Alson Kelen, director of a nonprofit called <A href=""https://www.facebook.com/wam.rmi"" target=""_blank"">Waan Aelõñ in Majel, or Canoes of the Marshall Islands</A>. </P><P class=""paragraph"">I met Alson, a smiley 47-year-old who looks like the surfer-dude version of George Foreman, at his canoe-building workshop on the Majuro lagoon.</P><P class=""paragraph"">Outside, a couple dozen young men were hacking away at a breadfruit tree, turning it into a vessel. They were planning a 200-mile voyage out to sea -- which is nothing for Kelen, who has ridden outrigger canoes from the Marshalls to both Hawaii and New Zealand, a trip where the sun blistered the bottoms of his feet.</P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;A lot of people navigate with their heads,&quot; he told me, sitting in his office, a stick-and-shell map of the currents of the Marshall Islands nailed to the ceiling above us. &quot;We navigate with our stomachs. We feel the swells and we know where we are.&quot;</P><P class=""paragraph"">Alson doesn't want to brag about these feats and is quick to say he's not a &quot;master navigator.&quot; His expertise, he insists, is the art of canoe building. </P><P class=""paragraph"">For details, he deferred to the experts. </P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;By lying on his back in the bilge of his canoe and sensing the motion of the canoe, the skilled pilot can 'fix' his position at night even without looking at the sea, for the movement of the canoe alone will tell him what kinds of swells are acting on it,&quot; <A href=""https://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/6-4/Marshall.pdf"" target=""_blank"">wrote University of Pennsylvania anthropologist William Davenport, in 1964</A>.</P><P class=""paragraph"">This strange skill is especially incredible -- and necessary -- when you consider the Marshall Islands are so low to the sea that they're basically invisible from a distance. </P><P class=""paragraph"">To know where an island is, you have to feel its presence. </P><P class=""paragraph"">That takes work, so training for &quot;master navigators&quot; starts in early childhood, said Joseph Genz, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Hawaii in Hilo. The youthful trainees are placed for hours at a time in mini-canoes and floated out onto the water so that they can tune their stomachs to the waves. </P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;This knowledge is very sensitive,&quot; the professor said by e-mail. </P><P class=""paragraph"">It's also exceedingly rare these days. Alson, however, hopes to bring back the art. He's already training dropouts to build canoes. And, one day, he wants to help them learn to navigate their oceanic nation. </P><P class=""paragraph"">He told me he'd be the last person to leave these islands if they sunk beneath rising seas -- that he'd be out here after everyone else, treading water. </P><P class=""paragraph"">But he also sees this training as an insurance policy. </P><P class=""paragraph"">If these kids have to abandon their country, at least they'll have some skills. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Maybe this piece of their heritage can survive. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Or at least they'll know it existed. </P><H3>'Adios Marshall Islands'</H3><P class=""paragraph"">In Majuro, ask anyone -- from Angie and her family to kids you find playing basketball on the street, using plastic buckets for hoops -- where they would move if the islands keep flooding and you tend to get one of three answers: Hawaii, which makes sense because it's close-ish, and it's also a collection of islands; Washington state, which is freakishly cold compared to Majuro, but, still, is on the West Coast. </P><P class=""paragraph"">And then: Arkansas. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Springdale, Arkansas, to be exact. </P><P class=""paragraph"">I was so perplexed that I decided to pay a visit to Springdale. </P><P class=""paragraph"">It's a woodsy town of rolling hills, blinking strip malls and taquerias. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Hundreds of miles from an ocean. </P><P class=""paragraph"">As landlocked as they come. </P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;It's the largest Marshallese population in the continental United States,&quot; said Carmen Chong Gum, the consul general of the Marshall Islands in Springdale. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Yeah, let me repeat that. The government of the Marshall Islands has an official consular office in Springdale, Arkansas. It shares a building with a barbershop, an attorney and a gadget repair store called Undead Electronics.</P><P class=""paragraph"">The population there is so sizable that I met a candidate for Marshallese senate, Tadashi Lometo, who was making a campaign stop in town. </P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;If you win in the States, you will also win back home,&quot; he said. &quot;We have a large community here in Arkansas.&quot;</P><P class=""paragraph"">How large is what's incredible, though.</P><P class=""paragraph"">The Marshall Islands is home to about 70,000. </P><P class=""paragraph"">There are 10,000 Marshallese in Northwest Arkansas, according to the consulate. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Ten-thousand people. Nearly 15% of the country's population. </P><P class=""paragraph"">And they vote by mail.</P><DIV class=""story-element full gallery""><H3 class=""gallery"">Photos: Life in the Marshall Islands</H3><DIV id=""rmi-gallery"" class=""element-media gallery owl-carousel owl-theme""><DIV class=""item""><P class=""gallery-caption"">Kids on the street in Majuro, Marshall Islands, in the remote Pacific, can tell you anything you want to know about <mark>climate change</mark>.

I couldn't wait to meet him -- to find out how this all happened. </P><P class=""paragraph"">But there's a problem, several folks told me: John Moody's dead. </P><P class=""paragraph"">One woman was so sure of this that she pulled up John Moody's tombstone on Google Images when I told her I was trying to find him. </P><P class=""paragraph"">But it turns out John Moody is not dead. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Just in hiding. </P><P class=""paragraph"">After engaging what felt like half the Marshallese population of Springdale, I tracked down John Moody -- blood in his cheeks and living about an hour and 20 minutes by car from Springdale. He's situated on top of a hill, in a beige double-wide trailer. Buzz cut and policeman mustache. Thirteen chickens running around out back. </P><P class=""paragraph"">He keeps to himself, he told me, because he's so well-known in Springdale that people stop him at traffic lights, yelling, &quot;Hey! John Moody!&quot;</P><P class=""paragraph"">It's the price you pay for being the original Marshallese in Arkansas.</P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;That's what they call me,&quot; he said. &quot;Pioneer.&quot; </P><P class=""paragraph"">John, 63, moved to the United States from the Marshall Islands in 1979 -- before the frequent flooding that Angie's family is now experiencing, but around the time that seas started rising because of a stark uptick in fossil fuel emissions. His first stop: Oklahoma, where he went to school on a recommendation. He got a summer job at a chicken processing plant and decided he liked that better. The work led him to Springdale, which is where Tyson and other poultry companies are based.</P><P class=""paragraph"">Soon, he had 13 or 14 relatives living with him -- all working on factory lines, dissecting chicken parts with knives for wages unthinkable on the islands.</P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;I said, 'Adios, Marshall Islands, I'm gone,'&quot; he told me, smiling. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Throngs of migrants followed, many looking for work or better schools for their children -- a chance to learn English. Marshallese people can live and work legally in the United States without a visa because of the <A href=""https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/173999.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Compact of Free Association</A>, which allows the United States to keep a military base on one of the atolls. (It's hard not to see this as more of a system of reparations for nuclear testing than as a favor to the islands, by the way. Starting after World War II, the United States detonated nuclear weapons on some remote atolls in the Marshall Islands, relocating entire populations and exposing others to cancer- and disease-causing radiation.)</P><P class=""paragraph"">Now, however, a new wave of migrants is emerging: Those, like Angie's family members, who worry their nation will be flooded. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Roselinta, Mark, Jitiam, Shiro. </P><P class=""paragraph"">You may have guessed it. </P><P class=""paragraph"">I met all of them in Arkansas. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Roselinta, who was living in the shack that floated away during the March 2014 flood in Majuro, told me she likes life better here. She lives in a second-floor, three-bedroom apartment with 10 family members. A dozen or so pairs of flip-flops are stacked up just inside the door. The apartment's walls are covered in family photos and flowers made from coconut husks and dried pandanus leaves.</P><P class=""paragraph"">I asked Roselinta what she liked so much about this place. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Her answer surprised me. </P><P class=""paragraph"">It's far from the ocean, she told me through an interpreter. </P><P class=""paragraph"">And that means it's safe.</P><H3>'In God's hands'</H3><P class=""paragraph"">In trying to understand this &quot;big ocean country,&quot; I figured I needed to get out on the water. Fortunately, Alson Kelen, the canoe guru, offered to give me a lift. </P><P class=""paragraph"">We didn't go far -- just across Majuro's kidney-bean lagoon -- but even that short journey was revelatory. Majuro essentially is one road, but if you're driving up and down it day after day, dodging kids and roosters that weave in and out of a steady stream of traffic, you start to forget just how isolated this location is, how fragile. </P><P class=""paragraph"">From the water, however, the land vanishes.</P><P class=""paragraph"">The outrigger landed on Ejit, a tooth-shaped island with no cars or roads. I roamed around with a resident-slash-security guard, David. He walked with a heavy limp and wore a thick beard, even though it's always sweat-through-your-T-shirt weather here. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Most residents of this island came originally from the Bikini Atoll, he told me. They were relocated a number of times after the United States conducted nuclear tests on their remote islands. A hydrogen bomb 1,000 times as powerful as those dropped on Japan during World War II was exploded on Bikini Atoll in 1954, after the war. </P><P class=""paragraph"">As testament to this awful history, I saw young children running around with Ejit Elementary School T-shirts that featured cartoons of that nuclear blast on the back. </P><P class=""paragraph"">The text, translated from Marshallese, read, &quot;Everything's in God's hands.&quot;</P><P class=""paragraph"">Or: The hands of the bomb makers, I thought.</P><P class=""paragraph"">Eventually, I sat down beneath a breadfruit tree -- with its leaves as long as a forearm and its starchy fruit -- to talk with Ken Amlek, a 23-year-old with piercing, raven eyes, whose family originated in Bikini. He explains its long, dark history in a yep-that's-how-it-is simplicity: &quot;They tested the bomb, and that's why we're here.&quot;</P><DIV class=""story-element full width""><DIV class=""element-caption""><P>Angie Hepisus, 44, says the sound of the ocean once was her lullaby. Now, it scares her.</P></DIV></DIV><P class=""paragraph"">Now, he said, this island, which he and his family never liked to begin with, is flooding frequently. The land is curved like a bowl, and it fills up at the center with saltwater, he said. He wants the United States to pay to relocate him. You could see a move as a form of <mark>climate change</mark> reparations, similar to the $604 million the United States has spent trying to make up for the nuclear tests, which not only evicted people from their ancestral homes but also were linked to cancer. </P><P class=""paragraph"">To date, although China isn't far behind, the United States is the <A href=""https://news.vice.com/article/china-is-poised-to-overtake-the-us-as-the-biggest-modern-contributor-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change"" target=""_blank"">largest aggregate polluter of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide</A>. So why not hold the United States liable?  </P><P class=""paragraph"">Maybe <mark>climate change</mark> is the new nuclear testing.</P><P class=""paragraph"">Slow moving, and less intentional. </P><P class=""paragraph"">But just as threatening. </P><P class=""paragraph"">I must say this argument started to work on me when I was on Ejit.  </P><P class=""paragraph"">Partly that's because Ejit is a place wedged between worlds. I saw girls playing checkers with rocks on a carved-out table -- while a friend tapped at her iPhone. There's no running water and limited electricity in some homes. Ken showed me the rain catchment tank he drinks from, and it was full of pinkie-finger-size fish, which he said are there on purpose because they eat the mosquitoes. When the tide's low, though, you can walk across the coral reef to Majuro, where there's an airport, hospital, restaurants and a handful of Wi-Fi hot spots. Life on Ejit, and especially the remote &quot;outer islands&quot; of this country, is hard. Leprosy remains a scourge, obesity rates are high, access to medical care inadequate. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Maybe the solution is to shove this country into the <mark>climate</mark>-changed future -- to accept the realities now, and deal with them accordingly. There's no international law to protect would-be &quot;<mark>climate</mark> refugees,&quot; Walter Kaelin, envoy of the chairmanship of the <A href=""https://www.nanseninitiative.org/"" target=""_blank"">Nansen Initiative</A>, a group that focuses on <mark>climate change</mark> and migration, told me. They can't seek asylum in other nations -- or haven't been able to. A man from Kiribati, according to news reports, tried to seek asylum as a <mark>climate</mark> refugee in New Zealand. The courts rejected him. And while people from the Marshall Islands can live and work legally in the United States, refugees from Kiribati or the Maldives, for example, would have nowhere else to go, legally, if their island nations disappeared. As a Plan B, Kiribati reportedly purchased more than 5,000 acres in Fiji. Academics who study this sort of planning tend to say it's healthy. They call it &quot;migration with dignity.&quot; Rather than a desperate flood of refugees. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Some island nations &quot;want to be able to choose when to go,&quot; said Walter. &quot;They want to be able to choose more or less where they go. </P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;In that sense they want to remain masters of their own destiny.&quot; </P><P class=""paragraph"">Think of it: A planned exodus before the country disappears -- before freshwater supplies get tainted with salt; before saltwater intrusion kills all the fruit trees; before floods are so frequent that people have no choice but to try to move away. </P><P class=""paragraph"">I started to think, maybe Ken Amlek is right -- maybe the United States should pay, now, to relocate anyone from the Marshall Islands who's willing to leave. A one-way flight from Majuro to the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport goes for $1,600 at the moment, when reserved one month in advance. (Duration: 33 hours. Stops in Honolulu, San Francisco and Houston.) Some families save up for a year or more to make that trip. Others, like Angie's cousins living in plywood-and-tin homes, seven or more family members crammed into one room, never could do that.</P><P class=""paragraph"">Based on that fare, it would cost $84 million to fly every Marshallese person to Arkansas. Maybe we should provide the funding, make this thing orderly. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Face the issue head-on.</P><P class=""paragraph"">Establish the New Marshall Islands. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Location: Springdale. </P><H3>'You have to hold them'</H3><P class=""paragraph"">On first glance, the islands have nothing in common with Arkansas. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Just look at Angie's family's arrangements. </P><P class=""paragraph"">In Majuro, they live in a small cluster of homes along the coast, three pandanus trees planted out back because their roots run deep and supposedly hold down the soil. When the leaves rattle in the ocean breeze they sound like rain. Sunsets electrify the clouds, all pink and orange, and a full moon makes the water shimmer at night. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Smiley ukulele music is almost always within earshot. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Compare that with Arkansas, where you climb a gravel staircase to reach the second-floor apartment. Inside, curtains are drawn all day and the lights are always out, in part because half the family works the night shift at the chicken packing plant, and because they're trying to save electricity. On the few days I spent time there, most people seemed to be watching TV or playing video games. They don't eat together because of their opposite schedules. Dinner's often ramen. </P><P class=""paragraph"">In the Marshall Islands, it would be rice and reef fish, served whole, the eye staring at you (Angie got onto me for cringing about the eye, and for apologizing to a fish before I peeled its skin off). Breadfruit and pandanus, a mustard-colored fruit that tastes like a mango merged with an avocado, are Marshallese staples. </P><P class=""paragraph"">There's a Marshallese grocery store in Springdale, but it's stocked only when the owner takes trips to the islands, bringing the merchandise in a cooler that she checks on the flight. The shelves are half-empty, and the store doesn't carry breadfruit or pandanus. They rot, a clerk told me, and there's not enough demand. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Look harder, though, and there are similarities. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Take religion. Almost everyone in the Marshall Islands is Christian. Angie and her family are Seventh Day Adventists, and there are churches for them in both locations. I'm told, actually, that there are more than 30 Marshallese churches near Springdale -- all of them offering services in the Marshallese language.</P><P class=""paragraph"">Then there are the big-little things, like sleeping arrangements. Many of the family members in the Marshall Islands sleep on thatched mats, rather than mattresses, but in both places the families sleep stacked next to each other. In the Springdale apartment, kids sleep in a room where three mattresses are arranged side by side. </P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;I'm used to sleeping with my children and my nieces, my nephews&quot; on the same mattress with me, said Cynthia Riklon, 45, Angie's sister, who's living in Arkansas.</P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;You have to hold them.&quot; </P><P class=""paragraph"">Especially when they're so far from home. </P><P class=""paragraph"">There's an intense sense of longing hanging over Springdale. </P><DIV class=""story-element full width""><DIV class=""element-caption""><P>First birthday parties, or kemems, are often bigger than weddings in the Marshall Islands.</P></DIV></DIV><P class=""paragraph"">That's especially true for older generations. Take people like Cynthia, who never left the Marshall Islands until she came here. She wouldn't have done it, she told me, if not for her kids. The Marshall Islands, especially with the floods, was no longer safe for them, she told me. When they're grown up -- when they've finished school and don't need her so close -- she wants to move back to the islands. </P><P class=""paragraph"">But her kids -- she wants them to put down roots here, where it's safe. </P><P class=""paragraph"">People like Cynthia do little things to hold onto what makes them Marshallese. I met Rumina Lakmis, from the <A href=""https://www.facebook.com/ArkanasasCoalitionofMarshallese"" target=""_blank"">Arkansas Coalition of Marshallese</A>, sitting at an office desk in the building that houses the consulate. Flip-flops are that line for her. &quot;During the cold winter, you see the American people all cuddled up with their scarves and sweaters and things,&quot; she said. &quot;And me? I wear my flip-flops all winter. See?&quot; she said, pointing down to her feet. &quot;It's my Marshallese culture. ... </P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;I don't feel Marshallese if I wear boots.&quot;</P><P class=""paragraph"">I met another Marshallese man in Springdale, Edison Maddison, 44, who told me he lies on the floor at night with all the lights off and stares at a small aquarium in the living room. A blue-cheeked fish swims in circles, illuminated by a single bulb. </P><P class=""paragraph"">The sight transports him back to the ocean -- back home. </P><P class=""paragraph"">I tried to bring a piece of the islands back with me, too, in the form of a video clip of Angie and her family in Majuro, standing on a sea wall they constructed after the March 2014 flood. It's twilight -- dark enough I had to shine a spotlight on the group to get their images to show up on camera. I promised them I'd show it to their stateside family members. John, Angie's nephew, plays the ukulele. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Angie chose the song: &quot;God bless Marshall Islands.&quot;</P><P class=""paragraph"">It's a farewell tune, I'm told. Appropriate for a funeral. </P><P class=""paragraph""><I>You see all the trouble going on</I></P><P class=""paragraph""><I>Things not getting better; but they're getting worse</I></P><P class=""paragraph""><I>God bless Marshall Islands once again.</I></P><P class=""paragraph"">It's a plea, in a sense. </P><P class=""paragraph"">See us, God? </P><P class=""paragraph"">We're down here, too.</P><H3>Two first birthdays</H3><P class=""paragraph"">A child's first birthday, or kemem, is perhaps the most significant celebration in the Marshallese culture. These parties are bigger than weddings. Historically, many infants did not live through their first year -- never reached maturity. </P><P class=""paragraph"">So a kemem is a rite of passage, and a celebration of survival. A hope for longevity and happiness. </P><P class=""paragraph"">I was fortunate enough to be invited to kemems in Majuro and Springdale. </P><P class=""paragraph"">In Majuro, I walked down an aisle of tiki torches with Angie, Timothy and their cousin, Darrell, to find one of the most joyously random scenes I've encountered: Some 500 people eating, singing and dancing in a courtyard on a tropical evening. There was a banner featuring three photos of the baby intermixed with those of unicorn ponies, a cake with an icing portrait of the 1-year-old, a cupcake tower, two bands, and tubs of rice so big two people had to carry them. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Plus, a chief. Looking very &quot;Godfather.&quot;  </P><P class=""paragraph"">It was easily the most lavish birthday party I've attended -- and, it's been a while, but I'm pretty sure it would compete with some episodes of <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Super_Sweet_16"" target=""_blank"">MTV's &quot;My Super Sweet 16</A>.&quot; I mostly spent my time there running around collecting photos and video clips, but, at one point, the (very kind and happy-to-be-photographed) family of the 1-year-old insisted I sit down to eat. And they didn't want me to eat just a little bit. </P><P class=""paragraph"">They wanted me to eat a tray of food as wide as a beach ball.</P><P class=""paragraph"">Angie's cousin, Darrell, helped me identify what I didn't recognize. Here's what we spotted, organized into two or three layers, with rice and spaghetti on the bottom: sea turtle (grilled), pandanus fruit cooked in coconut milk, sushi, sashimi (fish here often is consumed raw), fried chicken, spare ribs, coconut meat, potato salad, parrot fish, grilled breadfruit, grilled pumpkin cooked in coconut oil, breadfruit cooked underground, fresh breadfruit (so much breadfruit!) fruit salad, fried noodles, turtle intestines, boiled banana -- and a hot dog. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Again, all on one &quot;plate.&quot;</P><P class=""paragraph"">I sat there for a minute, picking at the food, and watching dancers in matching floral shirts squat and twist and pump their arms, as if doing push-ups in the air. I smelled the sweet, heavy air, felt the sweat on my skin. Saw the lights dangling from the breadfruit and pandanus trees, the 1-year-old clapping and cooing as people lined up to put $1 bills in her pink, inflatable swimming pool. I couldn't imagine all this -- this celebration, this hope for a 1-year-old child's bright future, this food, this party, this land, this life, the nation -- vanishing beneath saltwater. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Land is identity in the Marshall Islands. </P><P class=""paragraph"">What happens if the land is gone? </P><P class=""paragraph"">The Arkansas kemem took place at an indoor event space next to a Demolition Derby at the Rodeo of the Ozarks. I saw two Marshallese kids standing at the fence, fingers wrapped around the chain links. Car engines roared under the stadium lighting. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Going to the kemem? I asked. </P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;No.&quot;</P><P class=""paragraph"">They were transfixed by the cars.</P><P class=""paragraph"">Inside, the air conditioner was set to 68 degrees Fahrenheit, and a mechanical breeze fluttered balloons affixed to banquet-style tables. The room had a pitched roof and concrete floor. Portraits of white guys in cowboy hats adorned the back wall. There were about 100 people, some in traditional Marshallese dress -- floral prints, headbands, flip-flops. Others wore jogger jeans and high-top sneakers. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Yeah, there were a variety of foods. </P><P class=""paragraph"">But chicken seemed like the main course. </P><P class=""paragraph"">And only one kid danced. </P><P class=""paragraph"">I talked to several people about the steadily increasing migration of folks to Arkansas. Do you think it will pick up as <mark>climate change</mark> continues? </P><P class=""paragraph"">What do you think will happen to the islands? </P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;There's always Arkansas!&quot; said Mahku Moghaddam, 24, offering a consolation to the sinking nation. &quot;They're all welcome here.&quot;</P><P class=""paragraph"">Many of the Marshallese people came here, of course, for better jobs, better schools, better lives. Those were factors for Angie's family who moved here, too, on top of the floods. I don't begrudge them any of that. But I worry this is a window into the future -- a future when many Marshallese people will be here not because they choose to be but because they have to be. Because their country no longer exists. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Standing there in landlocked Springdale, I thought of Angie and her family on the coast in the Marshall Islands. They're considering leaving their country, too, and for a mix of reasons, as is always the case -- partly the floods and partly their family in the States. But they would hate this event, I'm sure. No breadfruit, no pandanus. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Air conditioners give Angie the chills. </P><P class=""paragraph"">In the back of the room, I chatted with three teenagers who had headphones jammed in their ears and smartphones stuck to their faces. I asked a kid in a Chicago Bulls hat what he thought about <mark>climate change</mark>. &quot;It's all right,&quot; he said, in that yeah-whatever, SNL-parody-of-Justin-Bieber sort of way. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Like, sure. Who cares? </P><P class=""paragraph"">Or, more accurately: Not my experience. </P><H3>'I'm not going to entertain that question'</H3><P class=""paragraph"">I have a confession to make: Maybe I'm the worst person to be telling you the story of the Marshall Islands. I'm from a country -- the United States -- that is helping raise sea levels worldwide and that conducted nuclear testing here. I flew on a plane to get here -- emitting 2,682.33 pounds of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the process, and that's just one-way. I grew up in a state, Oklahoma, represented by Sen. Jim Inhofe, one of the country's most vocal <mark>climate</mark> skeptics. He recently <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/02/26/jim-inhofes-snowball-has-disproven-<mark>climate</mark>-change-once-and-for-all/"" target=""_blank"">brought a snowball -- a snowball! -- onto the U.S. Senate floor</A> to show that, no, obviously global warming isn't happening. I mean, lookie here. There's snow.  </P><P class=""paragraph"">Such buffoonery is so shameful. I felt embarrassed to be in the Marshall Islands asking people questions about where they'd move. </P><P class=""paragraph"">I was glad when someone finally pushed back. </P><P class=""paragraph"">&quot;When people ask that it feels like defeat,&quot; <A href=""https://350.org/a-typical-presidents-daughter-probably-wouldnt-blockade-the-worlds-biggest-coal-port-but-milan-loeak-did/"" target=""_blank"">Milañ Loeak, a <mark>climate</mark> activist who also happens to be the President's daughter</A>, told me, very matter of fact. &quot;And I don't want to feel defeated. I don't want to entertain that question. I think people should be saying, 'What can we do to help?' instead of saying, 'When will you go?'&quot;</P><P class=""paragraph"">Or where will you go. </P><P class=""paragraph"">I have to agree with her. </P><P class=""paragraph"">If you bundle up all the Pacific countries, they contribute <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg2/index.php?idp=637"" target=""_blank"">0.03% of global <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions</A> from fossil fuels, according to a study cited by the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>. </P><P class=""paragraph"">These islands aren't causing this problem. </P><P class=""paragraph"">And because of that, they're powerless to save themselves. </P><H3>'Not yet underwater'</H3><P class=""paragraph"">The Marshall Islands is a place of stories. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Passed down by word of mouth so they won't disappear. </P><P class=""paragraph"">During my brief time in the islands, I met people like Angie who are witnessing <mark>climate change</mark> and who are trying to do what's best for themselves and their families. By sharing their stories, they hope the rest of us might listen -- might realize our actions have consequences for places we'll never see, for people we'll never meet. I also had the pleasure of meeting Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, a young mother and poet who has emerged as one of the country's pre-eminent storytellers. A teacher at the College of the Marshall Islands, the 27-year-old also studies the oral stories that form the fabric of her nation and culture. </P><DIV class=""story-element full width""><H3 class=""video"">Video poem: 'Two degrees is a gamble'</H3></DIV><P class=""paragraph"">She told me two of her favorites -- and one of her own. </P><P class=""paragraph"">It seems fitting to let her stories serve as the end of mine.</P><P class=""paragraph"">The first is the story of the Ripako, or shark clan, who are Kathy's distant relatives on her mother's side. True to their name, legend has it this group of people could communicate with sharks. They formed a sort of uneasy alliance with the tides, too. Instead of doing rain dances, as would have been common in North America, they held ceremonies on the reef aimed at willing the tide into equilibrium -- and keeping large waves from destroying their homes and flooding them out. </P><P class=""paragraph"">This conversation with the sharks -- and with the water -- helped them thrive in the harsh environment that always has been the Marshall Islands. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Theirs is a story of resourcefulness and survival.</P><P class=""paragraph"">The second story is one of neglect. </P><P class=""paragraph"">It's the legend of a boy who lost his mother, and the evil stepmother who replaced her (evil stepmothers predate Disney, apparently). The stepmother didn't provide the boy with enough food, nor the mat to use as clothing, nor a kite woven from leaves, so he could play. She was cruel and uncaring, not noticing how her decisions pushed the child toward depression and sadness. He had a strong spirit but was unable to provide for himself. The boy suffered in silence, afraid to complain to his stepmother or father, who didn't notice or didn't care, either. </P><P class=""paragraph"">One day, however, the boy was out fishing with his father. When his father dived beneath the waves after a fish, a bird appeared and started talking to the boy. </P><P class=""paragraph"">It was his mother, reincarnated. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Why are you crying, the bird asked her son. </P><P class=""paragraph"">No reason, the boy said. </P><P class=""paragraph"">The bird pecked at the son for lying to her. And when the father re-emerged from the waves, the bird flew away. </P><P class=""paragraph"">This scene repeated itself three times before the boy had the courage to tell the truth: That his stepmother and father weren't feeding him, that he had no mat, no kite. He finally gained the courage to confront his father and stepmother about this, too. When he stood up for himself, his mother, the bird, returned. She appreciated his quiet, respectful resistance to injustice -- so she turned the boy into a bird. The boy-bird flew away from his father and the evil stepmother, forever changed. </P><P class=""paragraph"">The father died in sorrow, searching for his lost son. If only he had noticed the trouble sooner -- had recognized the severity of the situation. </P><P class=""paragraph"">Then maybe he could have saved his son.</P><P class=""paragraph"">And himself. </P><DIV class=""story-element factbox""><H3>How to help save the Marshall Islands</H3><P>From reducing your <mark>carbon</mark> footprint to urging leaders stop warming short of 2 degrees, <A href=""https://www.cnn.com/2015/06/29/opinions/sutter-help-marshall-islands-<mark>climate</mark>/index.html"" target=""_blank"">there are a number of ways you can help ensure the Marshall Islands will survive</A> for future generations.</P></DIV><P class=""paragraph"">Kathy's own story seems influenced by those of her ancestors. </P><P class=""paragraph"">She has emerged as a clarion, moral voice on <mark>climate change</mark>, shouting into the wind from these distant islands.

This chapter summarizes how <mark>climate</mark> is changing, why it is changing, and what is projected for the future. While the focus is on changes in the United States, the need to provide context sometimes requires a broader geographical perspective. Additional geographic detail is presented in the regional chapters of this report. Further details on the topics covered by this chapter are provided in the <A href="" /report/appendices/<mark>climate</mark>-science-supplement""><mark>Climate</mark> Science Supplement </A>and <A href=""/report/appendices/faqs"">Frequently Asked Questions</A> Appendices.
</P><P>
The chapter presents 12 key messages about our changing <mark>climate</mark>, together with supporting evidence for those messages. The discussion of each key message begins with a summary of recent variations or trends, followed by projections of the corresponding changes for the future.

Winter storms have increased in frequency and intensity since the 1950s, and their tracks have shifted northward over the United States. Other trends in severe storms, including the intensity and frequency of tornadoes, hail, and damaging thunderstorm winds, are uncertain and are being studied intensively.

Process for Developing Key Messages
</H4><P>
Development of the key messages involved discussions of the lead authors and accompanying analyses conducted via one in-person meeting plus multiple teleconferences and email exchanges from February thru September 2012. The authors reviewed 80 technical inputs provided by the public, as well as other published literature, and applied their professional judgment.
</P><P>
Key message development also involved the findings from four special workshops that related to the latest scientific understanding of <mark>climate</mark> extremes. Each workshop had a different theme related to <mark>climate</mark> extremes, had approximately 30 attendees (the CMIP5 meeting had more than 100), and the workshops resulted in a paper.<SUP id=""fnref:b91893b4-24a8-46ba-b09a-013d462caf1b""><A href=""#fn:b91893b4-24a8-46ba-b09a-013d462caf1b"" rel=""footnote"">10</A></SUP> The first workshop was held in July 2011, titled Monitoring Changes in Extreme Storm Statistics: State of Knowledge.<SUP id=""fnref:b37557ac-ee97-4c28-98ca-4f1f1afe163b""><A href=""#fn:b37557ac-ee97-4c28-98ca-4f1f1afe163b"" rel=""footnote"">11</A></SUP> The second was held in November 2011, titled Forum on Trends and Causes of Observed Changes in Heatwaves, Coldwaves, Floods, and Drought.<SUP id=""fnref:e15600d0-290f-44e2-9b58-9ffd295ee6d2""><A href=""#fn:e15600d0-290f-44e2-9b58-9ffd295ee6d2"" rel=""footnote"">12</A></SUP> The third was held in January 2012, titled Forum on Trends in Extreme Winds, Waves, and Extratropical Storms along the Coasts.<SUP id=""fnref:596a7f1e-6ce5-4bdf-b144-d0715a7567bd""><A href=""#fn:596a7f1e-6ce5-4bdf-b144-d0715a7567bd"" rel=""footnote"">1</A></SUP> The fourth, the CMIP5 results workshop, was held in March 2012 in Hawai‘i, and resulted in an analysis of CMIP5 results relative to <mark>climate</mark> extremes in the United States.<SUP id=""fnref:b91893b4-24a8-46ba-b09a-013d462caf1b""><A href=""#fn:b91893b4-24a8-46ba-b09a-013d462caf1b"" rel=""footnote"">10</A></SUP></P><P>
The Chapter Author Team’s discussions were supported by targeted consultation with additional experts. Professional expertise and judgment led to determining “key vulnerabilities.” A consensus-based approach was used for final key message selection.
</P></DIV><DIV class=""traceable-accounts-table clearfix""><H3>
Description of evidence base
</H3><P>
The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the <mark>climate</mark> science peer-reviewed literature.

Severe Convective Storms

Tornadoes and other severe thunderstorm phenomena frequently cause as much annual property damage in the U.S. as do hurricanes, and often cause more deaths. Recent research has yielded insights into the connections between global warming and the factors that cause tornadoes and severe thunderstorms (such as atmospheric instability and increases in wind speed with altitude<SUP id=""fnref:242ad1ac-9e37-44e6-9e8f-43cb318ace99""><A href=""#fn:242ad1ac-9e37-44e6-9e8f-43cb318ace99"" rel=""footnote"">7</A></SUP><SUP>,</SUP><SUP id=""fnref:7ede85ab-94c5-46e3-8bb5-0d98844a98db""><A href=""#fn:7ede85ab-94c5-46e3-8bb5-0d98844a98db"" rel=""footnote"">8</A></SUP>).

The peak, which the Forest Service designated a scenic botanical special interest area in 1989, is home to a distinctive plant community, including a rare noble fir forest and rolling meadows, which showcase a menagerie of native grasses and wildflowers. Glacier lilies poke through the snow in spring, followed by fiery columbine, purple alliums and dainty pink phlox.</P><DIV class=""image-inline captioned""><FIGURE style=""width:768px""><FIGCAPTION><DIV class=""caption"">Lilies growing on Marys Peak.</DIV><DIV class=""credit"">Julia Rosen</DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><P>Davis is here because, over the last century or so, the Harry Potter tree and its fellow noble firs have invaded the meadows on the summit of Marys Peak. In places, the trees have crowded out the wildflowers and blocked the mountain's panoramic views, which draw approximately 10,000 annual visitors. Many worry that the meadows could vanish completely.</P><P>In response, the Siuslaw National Forest has decided to fight for the meadows. In the fall of 2015, crews undertook a campaign to remove roughly 3,000 trees from 25 acres of former meadow. Crews have also sawed the stumps down to the ground, and plan to reseed reclaimed land with native grasses. On this cool November day, the work continues; the roar of chainsaws splits the fog and the air is sweet with the aroma of fresh sawdust.</P><P>The trees aren't the real enemy, however. They're collateral damage. In fact, these proud stands of noble fir are just as unique as the meadows themselves. Scientists think both ecosystems date back more than 10,000 years to the last glacial period, when they covered large swaths of western Oregon. As the planet thawed, they retreated to high-elevation parts of the Cascade Mountains and isolated pockets in the Coast Range, like Marys Peak.</P><P>Since then, the firs and meadows have shared this piece of real estate. But here and elsewhere across the West, <mark>climate change</mark> and other human activities have started to tip the scales in favor of forests. Now, an encroaching tide of trees threatens to erase an iconic component of the Western landscape, swallowing entire ecosystems in the process. When that happens, land managers like Davis face a difficult choice: Should they sit by and let the meadows disappear, or should they intervene in nature's response to a changing world?</P><DIV class=""image-inline captioned""><FIGURE style=""width:768px""><FIGCAPTION><DIV class=""caption"">Young trees crop up along the edge of meadows on Mary's Peak.</DIV><DIV class=""credit"">Harold Zald/Oregon State University</DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><P class=""dropcap"">To understand why a meadow exists, you have to understand why trees don't. &quot;The big picture is that meadows are places where there's one or many limiting factors that make it hard for trees to establish,&quot; says Harold Zald, a forest ecologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. In subalpine zones, long winters and deep snow often keep the growing season too short for tree seedlings to thrive. At lower elevations, below the snowline, frequent fires can singe saplings before they grow strong enough to survive. Wet, cold soils — and thin, rocky ones — can also make it hard for trees to gain a foothold.</P><P>But even though meadows have small footprints, they have outsized significance. &quot;They are real biodiversity hotspots,&quot; says Kaitlin Lubetkin, the interim director of the Sierra Nevada Research Stations in Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks. Many meadow plants grow only in open clearings, and many more insects and animals depend on them, or the easy cover of the forest edge. Meadow soils also play an important role in the hydrologic cycle. &quot;They sort of act like a sponge,&quot; soaking up rain and helping prevent flooding, then slowly releasing water later, Lubetkin says. And of course, humans love meadows for the views.</P><P>These days, though, rising temperatures, shrinking snowpack and fire suppression have weakened the forces that once held trees at bay. On Marys Peak, people have also meddled with the meadows. Early settlers used them as sheep pastures in the late 1800s and early 1900s, perhaps helping keep them open. More recently, various projects, including the construction of a short-lived ski lift and several communications towers on the summit, have disturbed the soil and encouraged trees to take root.</P><P>But even if the exact causes of forest encroachment remain uncertain, the trajectory is clear. Using historical photos, Zald calculated a 35 percent loss in meadow area between 1948 and 1994. That figure served as a wake-up call for Frank Davis, who brought it to the attention of a Forest Service ecologist named Cindy McCain in 2007. The pair considered their options, and saw an opportunity to act when it came time to reassess the management plan for the lands around Marys Peak.</P><DIV class=""image-inline""><FIGURE style=""width:1500px""><FIGCAPTION><DIV class=""credit"">Harold Zald/Oregon State University</DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><P>&quot;If we stepped aside and let what is a perfectly natural process go — as it would be appropriate to do in many circumstances — then the meadows would be extremely reduced,&quot; says McCain, who has since retired. &quot;But if we wanted the meadows, it was now or never.&quot; So the Siuslaw developed a plan to restore the meadows to their 1948 extent — a somewhat arbitrary benchmark, but one that would succeed in re-establishing connectivity between the half-dozen lobes now separated by trees.</P><P>They presented the idea to local residents of Benton County, who overwhelmingly supported it, in part because they had witnessed the changes themselves. &quot;The meadows that I used to be able to walk through just aren't there anymore,&quot; says Phil Hays, a Corvallis resident who has visited the peak regularly since 1974 and meticulously documented its native plants. The Siuslaw plan got final approval from the district ranger in 2010, and the Forest Service negotiated a deal with Miller Timber Services — a subcontractor for the paper giant <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark> — to remove the offending trees. The sale also included the right to thin other plots of more valuable Douglas-firs.</P><P>Felling a forest to free a meadow may strike some as a drastic response, but the Forest Service saw that the future of a beloved ecosystem might be at stake. At some point, Jerry Ingersoll, supervisor of the Siuslaw, says he realized inaction was also an active choice: &quot;Doing nothing has its own consequences.&quot;</P><P class=""dropcap"">The same philosophy has guided land-management practices in other places where trees have invaded meadows. Every year, the Bureau of Land Management conducts prescribed burns across the Intermountain West to restore the meadows that, among other things, provide important habitat for big game. In Montana, for instance, the BLM burned 200 acres near the ghost town of Garnet in 2012. &quot;The diversity is just incredible of what came back,&quot; says John Thompson, chief fire officer for the Western Montana District. Historically, wildfires would have done the job, aided in places by human-sparked blazes, which Native Americans used to manage hunting grounds.</P><P>Yosemite National Park also has a long history of managing the trees on its lands. As far back as the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps — which put the unemployed to work improving public lands during the Great Depression — removed young lodgepole pines from Tuolumne Meadows to preserve its eponymous expanses. A modern continuation of that effort is the Scenic Vista Management Program, which aims to protect Yosemite's famous &quot;viewsheds&quot; and the natural processes behind them, according to park spokesman Scott Gediman. So far, the park has tackled 30 out of more than 100 potential sites, removing dozens to hundreds of trees at each one.</P><P>Such efforts may be warranted in certain high-priority spots, says Lubetkin, who has thoroughly studied Yosemite's meadows. But when it comes to the Sierra's countless other meadows, land managers may be fighting a losing battle. Lubetkin's research suggests that although fire suppression and other human activities may have hastened meadow declines in the park, <mark>climate change</mark> now plays a dominant role. And while a few meadows may survive on their own, most will likely need some kind of help. Removing trees from these would be great, Lubetkin says, &quot;if we had infinite manpower.&quot; As it is, &quot;it's sort of a futile effort.&quot;</P><P>The best way to save <mark>climate</mark>-sensitive meadows is to rein in greenhouse gas emissions, says Janneke Hille Ris Lambers, a meadow expert at the University of Washington in Seattle. &quot;The trees are just responding to <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; Lambers says. &quot;It's a little weird to prevent them from doing it.&quot;</P><P>Others worry about the unknown — and perhaps dangerous — consequences of cutting down trees. &quot;We don't know how many things we change once we start removing them,&quot; says Regina Rochefort, a science advisor at Washington's North Cascades National Park, which has also experienced forest encroachment. Taking out trees won't stop shrubs from moving in, and many fear that the disturbance could create openings for invasive species. With the world changing around them, Rochefort says, &quot;you're not going to preserve the flower fields the way you think you are.&quot;</P><P class=""dropcap"">Ingersoll and his colleagues at the Siuslaw are well aware of the risks of intervention, and they have tried to protect the natural processes at work on Marys Peak as much as possible. All logging equipment is cleaned and inspected for hitchhiking seeds before workers drive the long winding road to the summit. And crews have laid down freshly cut slash, so heavy machinery can cross the meadows without tearing up the soil.</P><DIV class=""image-inline captioned""><FIGURE style=""width:768px""><FIGCAPTION><DIV class=""caption"">Looking out from the summit of Mary's Peak.</DIV><DIV class=""credit"">Harold Zald/Oregon State University</DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><P>Ingersoll also acknowledges that the task won't be finished when the last truck of logs lumbers down the road. Success will depend on long-term monitoring, and on diligently removing noble firs and invasive plants before they spread, a daunting task. For that, Ingersoll says, the Forest Service will rely on help from citizen groups, like local chapters of the Native Plants Society of Oregon and the Sierra Club, and a volunteer task force called the Marys Peak Alliance, whose members include Cindy McCain and Phil Hays.</P><P>In the end, Ingersoll feels confident about the decision to intervene. &quot;One of the precautionary principles that you try to follow is 'try to keep all the pieces,' &quot; he says, a nod to Aldo Leopold's Land Ethic. If the Siuslaw hadn't acted, an important piece — the meadows — might have been lost forever. Instead, the Forest Service took the more conservative path, Ingersoll says, which was to &quot;preserve options&quot; and not &quot;commit things that are irrevocable.&quot;</P><P>&quot;We're turning the clock back a little bit,&quot; Ingersoll says. But if, years or decades from now, land managers come to regret the decision, all they have to do is stop maintaining the meadows. Then, the trees will resume their slow, steady march, and &quot;we'll be right back where we started.&quot;</P><P><EM>Julia Rosen is a freelance reporter based in Portland, Oregon. </EM></P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Some mammals have very specific climatic adaptations, such as requirements for snow, sea ice, or temperatures within a narrow range for hibernation. Some have distributions that are dependent on <mark>climate</mark>. Most mammals will not be able to avoid the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, with both positive and negative effects possible. Mammals generally utilize a variety of often disjunct resources. They need places to hide, eat, drink, and breed, and in many cases these places are distinct and may change seasonally. Thus there are many opportunities for <mark>climate change</mark> to disrupt mammalian life histories. In general they will not be able to effectively hide in microhabitats; in contrast many plants can persist as rare endemics long after the <mark>climate</mark> has changed. Most mammals are also highly mobile and, compared to perennial plants, have relatively short (generally &lt; 20 yrs) life spans. Thus, if <mark>climate</mark>s become unsuitable, mammalian response can be expected to be rapid.</P><P>Mammals play dominant roles in many systems. They make up most of the terrestrial large-bodied predators in North America, and these large, high-trophic mammals have significant impacts on the ecosystems they inhabit. For example, gray wolf introduction in Yellowstone National Park has reduced the northern elk herd to approximately 1/3 of its former size (1, Figure 1), which has initiated a cascade of ecological effects (2, 3). Rodents and lagomorphs (hares, pikas, and rabbits) are the primary prey for many mammalian, avian, and reptilian predators and rodents can affect the composition of vegetative communities through seed predation (4). Small terrestrial mammals, including rodents and insectivores (shrews), typically comprise the largest and most diverse group of mammals in many ecosystems (e. g. 5); thus, most of the changes in mammal abundances and distributions resulting from <mark>climate change</mark> are expected to be in this group (e. g. 6). Additionally rodents host many diseases that can affect us. Many tick- and flea-borne diseases that infect humans, including Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted tick fever, Tularemia, plague, and Ehrlichiosis are carried by rodents or rodents serve as the reservoir hosts (7); the prevalence of these diseases is often strongly linked to population size (e.g., 8, 9). Thus, changes in mammal communities will have profound impacts on ecosystems and may directly affect human societies.</P><H3 class=""resource_h3"">Likely Changes</H3><P>The effects of <mark>climate change</mark>s on mammals can sometimes be ascertained directly through the study of their biology and physiology. For example, once it is understood that wolverines require snow to den (10, 11) and persistent spring snow defines the southern extent of their range (11), the likely effects of reduced snowpack are straightforward (12). There is no evidence that wolverines will be able to persist in areas that lose their snow as a consequence of <mark>climate change</mark>. For most mammals, however, <mark>climate</mark> broadly defines their ecological niche. Therefore for many species, future distributions are estimated by correlating climatic factors with their current ranges and projecting these models into the future (e. g. 13). Here we examine 3 species that illustrate some of the myriad of ways that <mark>climate</mark> is likely to affect mammals.</P><H4>Research</H4><P><STRONG>The Indiana bat (encounters with diseases)</STRONG>The Indiana bat (<EM>Myotis sodalis</EM>) presents an example of how changing <mark>climate</mark>s and introduction of exotic organisms can together threaten the persistence of native mammal species. The Indiana bat, (listed as federally endangered in 1967), ranges throughout the northeastern, midwestern, and parts of the southeastern U.S. During winter, Indiana bats hibernate in caves and mines within a narrow thermal range (3.0-7.2°C; 14). The most important hibernation sites occur primarily in the Midwest and Southeast (15). Currently, most of these important sites are exterior to the area affected by white nose syndrome (WNS), a lethal disease caused by an imported European fungus (16). <mark>Climate change</mark> predictions suggest the summer range of Indiana Bats may move north and east (17). This would move them closer to the areas most affected by WNS; the disease has resulted in the death of approximately 72% of the Indiana bats that hibernate in the Northeast since 2006-2007 (18).</P><P><STRONG>The snowshoe hare (snow dependency)</STRONG>The snowshoe hare (<EM>Lepus americanus</EM>) is a small lagomorph well- adapted to seasonally snowy environments. Its range includes most of Alaska and Canada, with montane extensions as far south as California and New Mexico in the western U.S. and West Virginia in the eastern U.S. It has oversized rear paws leading to low foot loadings (19, Figure 4.3), and seasonally changes its pelage from mostly brown to white. Snowshoe hares are typically killed by predators (as opposed to dying of starvation, old age, etc.; 20). Thus, predator avoidance is a critical aspect of snowshoe-hare behavior (21). Hares may be particularly vulnerable when their coloration does not match the background-a white hare on a brown background is more visible to predators (22). The period when the landscape is predictably snow covered is extremely sensitive to <mark>climate</mark> (23, 24). With <mark>climate change</mark>, spring snowmelt is predicted to occur earlier (23, 22) and snow cover lost sooner (25) in areas inhabited by the snowshoe hare. Hare pelage change has limited plasticity in the rate of the spring white-to-brown molt, but both initiation dates of color change and the rate of the fall brown-to-white molt are fixed; unless the timing of coat color change can be modified by natural selection, the reduced snowpack will increase periods of mismatch by 3 - 8 times (22).</P><P><STRONG>The American pika (sensitivity to temperature and water-balance stresses, perhaps mediated by vegetation)</STRONG>The pika (<EM>Ochotona princeps</EM>) is a small lagomorph that often inhabits alpine areas in the western U. S. In the Great Basin, pika habitat occurs as small islands near the tops of mountains. Pikas appear dependent both on moist and cool summer conditions and winter snow (26). Historically and during the 20th century, pikas have reacted to <mark>climate change</mark>s by moving upslope or becoming locally extirpated when the weather becomes hot and dry (26). In the Great Basin, sites of pika extirpation (1994-2008; 27) were generally hotter in the summer and more frequently very cold in the winter than sites where pika persisted - warming led to the removal of insulating snow causing nighttime winter temperatures to plummet (27). Winter snowpack not only insulates pikas during cold snaps, but also may provide water longer into the summer season, when plant senescence at drier sites occurs earlier in the year, which eliminates water availability for pika. Analyses suggest that both chronic stresses (average temperature during all of summer, snowpack and growing-season precipitation), acute (hot and cold) temperature stresses, and vegetation productivity may all be playing a role in pika declines in the Basin over the last decades.</P><H3 class=""resource_h3"">Options for Management</H3><P>Managing lands or species in the face of <mark>climate change</mark> requires an acknowledgement of both the range of different effects and the high levels of uncertainty involved in local projections. Additionally, projections are for <mark>climate</mark>, not weather. As such, they produce long-term averages. Organisms, including mammals, generally respond to weather events that deviate from the average such as droughts, extreme or unusual cold or heat, and storms. Thus, the weather that organisms actually respond to will be inferred from relatively broad-scale <mark>climate</mark> projections. Additional uncertainties exist in predicting mammalian responses to changing <mark>climate</mark>. Unforeseen opportunities and stressors can be expected-white nose syndrome, for example, was discovered in 2006 (16). However, these uncertainties do not preclude active management to conserve mammals, they simply change the nature of that management. Many approaches are generically beneficial for native species, and are particularly beneficial given <mark>climate change</mark>. These include:</P><OL><LI>Maintain and if possible improve landscape connectivity.</LI><LI>Reduce stresses on current populations and habitats.</LI><LI>Maintain or improve current habitat for specific species.</LI><LI>Manage to maintain landscape diversity.</LI><LI>Monitor change.</LI></OL><P>A connected landscape allows mammals to seek appropriate habitats and prevents the negative consequences of small isolated populations, such as increased extinction risks and lower fitness. Negative effects of <mark>climate change</mark> can be ameliorated by reducing other human-caused stressors (e.g. invasive species, development, overharvest). With higher fitness across habitats, organisms may be able to persist in what was formerly &quot;sink&quot; habitat*, both increasing overall population size and range and increasing adaptive potential. Similarly, habitat improvement will help maintain a large, healthy population, which may improve its likelihood of persistence. Diverse landscapes increase overall resilience and provide opportunities for adaptation. Lastly, because <mark>climate change</mark> will lead to many unexpected ecological effects, systems must be in place to rapidly identify and monitor these effects and facilitate appropriate management responses.</P><P><STRONG><EM>* </EM></STRONG><EM>Sink habitat =habitat that is currently occupied, but where populations cannot persist without external subsidies from organisms that emigrate from better quality areas.</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""field field-name-field-references field-type-text-long field-label-above""><DIV class=""field-label"">References: </DIV></DIV></DIV></FIELDSET></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

		Crowell <SPAN class=""amp"">&amp;</SPAN> Moring</H3><P>Crowell's three-page alert came out just five days after Schneiderman's office subpoenaed ExxonMobil.
		The memo, titled “The Widening Circles of the Exxon Mobil <mark>Climate</mark> Disclosure Investigation and Its Implications for Energy Companies,” took note of both the <A href=""http://graphics.latimes.com/exxon-arctic/"">Los Angeles Times</A> and <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken"">Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News</A> investigations that put “<A href=""https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=news&amp;q=%23EXXONKNEW"">Exxon Knew</A>” as a meme on the map. It pointed to them as evidence that the investigation has already gotten off to a head start, given the breadth and depth of the journalism.
		“The Exxon Mobil investigation could prove even more complex, and the results more far-reaching, because of the long history of the company's own research into <mark>climate</mark>-related issues and its own public disclosures (including <SPAN class=""caps"">SEC</SPAN> filings) on the topic,” reads the alert.
		“[I]n addition to the information likely to be yielded by the scope of the [New York <SPAN class=""caps"">AG</SPAN>] subpoenas, the Exxon Mobil public record has already been enhanced by two widely reported independent private investigations by news organizations, including a joint Los Angeles Times/Columbia University School of Journalism study, which describes in detail Exxon's <mark>climate</mark> research in the Arctic and the company's corresponding statements to, and omissions from, the investing public about the perceived business threat from <mark>climate change</mark>.”
		Former Crowell attorney <A href=""http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Victor_Schwartz"">Victor Schwartz</A> — now with Shook, Hardy <SPAN class=""amp"">&amp;</SPAN> Bacon and a <A href=""https://www.alec.org/person/victor-schwartz/"">member</A> of the <A href=""http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/American_Legislative_Exchange_Council"">American Legislative Exchange Council</A>'s board of scholars — <A href=""https://industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=pgpk0059"">formerly represented tobacco giant Philip Morris</A> on behalf of the firm. <SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;"">Crowell</SPAN> has maintained Shell, Chevron, Koch Industries subsidiary Georgia-Pacific, Duke Energy, Alpha Natural Resources, Peabody Energy, General Electric, American Petroleum Institute, Arch Coal, Schlumberger and others as <A href=""http://www.law360.com/firms/crowell-moring/clients"">legal clients</A>. 
		A Koch-funded front group, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, has <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/08042016/think-tank-fossil-fuel-ties-competitive-enterprise-institute-subpoena-attorney-general-<mark>climate</mark>-change-exxon"">already received a subpoena</A> from the Attorney General of the Virgin Islands. And the American Petroleum Institute serves as one of the subjects of an Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News investigative piece, having <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/22122015/exxon-mobil-oil-industry-peers-knew-about-<mark>climate</mark>-change-dangers-1970s-american-petroleum-institute-api-shell-chevron-texaco"">studied the impacts</A> of industry-created <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere beginning back in the late-1970's only to proceed with funding <mark>climate</mark> denial in the following decades.</P><H3><SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;"">King <SPAN class=""amp"">&amp;</SPAN> Spalding</SPAN></H3><P>On April 18, King <SPAN class=""amp"">&amp;</SPAN> Spalding published its four-page client alert. <SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;"">One of King's clients is Chevron, which it <A href=""http://www.kslaw.com/News-and-Insights/NewsDetail?us_nsc_id=5082"">represented</A> in the still-ongoing <mark>pollution</mark> case in Ecuador. It also has <A href=""http://www.law360.com/firms/king-spalding/clients"">represented</A> Shell Oil, ConocoPhillips, Georgia-Pacific, Halliburton, General Electric, Anadarko Petroleum, Peabody Energy, Occidental Petroleum, Marathon Oil, Motiva Enterprises, <A href=""//www.desmogblog.com/sites/beta.desmogblog.com/files/Autry%20Petroleum%20Company%20et%20al%20v.%20BP%20Oil%20Products%20North%20America.pdf""><SPAN class=""caps"">BP</SPAN></A> and <A href=""http://www.kslaw.com/News-and-Insights/NewsDetail?us_nsc_id=6541"">Big Tobacco companies</A>. </SPAN>
		King <SPAN class=""amp"">&amp;</SPAN> Spalding opened up the alert by stating that the “growing focus by state <SPAN class=""caps"">AG</SPAN>s on <mark>climate change</mark> could present significant challenges for energy companies going forward.”
		“These new investigations are a striking reminder of the increasingly aggressive role that state <SPAN class=""caps"">AG</SPAN>s play in the government investigations arena,” King went on to write. “In recent years, state <SPAN class=""caps"">AG</SPAN>s have become increasingly involved in high-profile policy issues like <mark>climate change</mark> that are part of ongoing national debates. In some situations, these investigations look more like prospective policymaking than retrospective enforcement action.”
		In the alert, <SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;"">King <SPAN class=""amp"">&amp;</SPAN> Spalding</SPAN> also touted its “strategic partnership” with former Wisconsin Republican Attorney General <SPAN class=""caps"">J.B.</SPAN> Van Hollen, <A href=""http://www.kslaw.com/News-and-Insights/NewsDetail?us_nsc_id=9138"">launched in October 2015</A>, and its past attorney-client relationship with Brown and Williamson Tobacco Company (which has since merged into <SPAN class=""caps"">R.J.</SPAN> Reynolds Tobacco Company). </P><H3>
		Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman</H3><P>Pilsbury, like the others, told its clients that although Exxon has come first in this investigation, there's a chance they could fall next in line. Not only that, the firm recommended deferring the legal costs of such an investigation to their insurance companies.
		“Although the details of future enforcement activity are not clear, it is reasonable to expect increasing government scrutiny of <mark>climate change</mark>-related disclosures,” wrote the firm to its clients.
		“Our White Collar and Insurance Recovery and Advisory attorneys routinely evaluate <SPAN class=""caps"">CID</SPAN>s and subpoenas and help clients not only to develop strategies to respond, but to maximize the potential that our clients’ insurance companies pay for that response. In most cases, we are able to review and evaluate specific situations for relatively low cost or fixed fee arrangements, which enable us to assist our clients to proactively improve our clients’ position and minimize their risk.”
		The <A href=""http://www.law360.com/firms/pillsbury-winthrop/clients"">firm's client list</A> has included the likes of Chevron, British American Tobacco, Schlumberger, as well as <A href=""http://www.pillsburylaw.com/litigation"">Duke Energy</A>.</P><H3>
		Contemplating Similar Fate?</H3><P>A recent report published by the Center for International Environmental Law (<SPAN class=""caps"">CIEL</SPAN>), based on documents put up on the website <A href=""https://www.smokeandfumes.org/#/"">SmokeAndFumes.org</A>, moved back the time clock of what the fossil fuel industry knew and when it knew it with regards to <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide <mark>pollution</mark> and global warming. The report concluded that knowledge dated back at least to the 1950's, which coincided with the industry proceeding to create a disinformation campaign to confuse the public about the impacts of emitting <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into the atmosphere.</P><P><SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;""><SPAN class=""caps"">CIEL</SPAN> president </SPAN><SPAN style=""line-height: 1.1em;"">Carroll Muffett described DeSmog's findings as important on a number of levels.  </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""line-height: 1.1em;"">“These notices to clients demonstrate that, even as Exxon and its allies attempt to minimize and dismiss the <SPAN class=""caps"">AG</SPAN> investigations in the media, the fossil fuel industry recognizes their significance for individual companies and for the industry as a whole,” Muffett told DeSmog. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""line-height: 1.1em;"">“That oil companies are turning to the same firms that represented tobacco is telling: once it began, tobacco litigation continued for decades and ultimately ensnared the entire industry. Fossil fuel producers are now clearly–and legitimately–contemplating a similar fate,” Muffett said.</SPAN>

Georgia’s disruptively warm winter caused the loss of an estimated 85 percent of the peach crop. “We had fruit here in Georgia from the middle of May to about probably the first week of July, and after that we didn’t have anything else,” said Dario Chavez, an assistant professor in peach research and extension at the University of Georgia.<A class=""espn-footnote-link"" data-footnote-id=""1"" href=""#fn-1"" data-footnote-content=""&lt;p&gt;The Georgia peach season typically runs through mid-August&lt;/p&gt;

California’s cherry crop <A href=""https://ww2.kqed.org/bayareabites/2014/05/13/light-california-cherry-season-thanks-to-warm-winter-expect-higher-prices/"">took a hit</A> in 2014 because of a warm, dry winter. And in 2012, after a warm February and March brought early blooms, Michigan’s apple crop <A href=""http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2012/07/apple_growers_lament_crop_fail.html"">was decimated</A> by an April frost. Farmers have always been at the mercy of the environment, but now agricultural catastrophes brought on by warm winters <A href=""http://kvpr.org/post/too-warm-grow-tree-crops-farmers-work-temper-<mark>climate</mark>-change-effects"">seem likely</A> to occur with greater frequency.</P><P>For trees that fruit each year (such as peaches, cherries, blueberries, almonds and <A href=""http://www.raintreenursery.com/chill_hours.html"">other fruits and nuts</A>), cool weather is as important as warm. Cold air and less sunlight trigger the release of chemicals that halt trees’ growth, prepare them to withstand freezing temperatures and enable them to resume growing the following spring. When a tree enters this dormant state, it sets a kind of internal seasonal alarm clock that goes off once the tree has spent enough time in chilly temperatures.<A class=""espn-footnote-link"" data-footnote-id=""2"" href=""#fn-2"" data-footnote-content=""&lt;p&gt;Once a tree has had the minimum amount of chill it needs, it knows to get ready to wake up again and clean out the compounds that have protected it through the winter. Warm temperatures typically prompt budding, but if they come before a tree has had sufficient chill time, it may not be fully out of dormancy and prepared for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
""><SUP id=""ss-2"">2</SUP></A> This countdown is measured in so-called chill hours — the amount of time the temperature is between 32 and 45 degrees Fahrenheit.<A class=""espn-footnote-link"" data-footnote-id=""3"" href=""#fn-3"" data-footnote-content=""&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/stonefruit/chillacc.html&quot;&gt;variants&lt;/a&gt; of this basic formula. Growers in warmer climes where excessive freezing temperatures are not a concern simply may count the hours below 45 degrees. Some &lt;a href=&quot;http://cesacramento.ucanr.edu/Pomology/Chill_Portions_Dynamic_Model/&quot;&gt;newer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://fruitsandnuts.ucdavis.edu/Weather_Services/chilling_accumulation_models/about_chilling_units/&quot;&gt;models&lt;/a&gt; count “chill units” or portions, in which very warm winter spells are subtracted from the overall chill.&lt;/p&gt;
""><SUP id=""ss-3"">3</SUP></A> When crops don’t get the chill hours they expect, they can’t properly reset. Buds are delayed, and instead of ripening into juicy, delicious fruit, they remain small and underdeveloped.<A class=""espn-footnote-link"" data-footnote-id=""4"" href=""#fn-4"" data-footnote-content=""&lt;p&gt;The number of chill hours required varies among species and even among varieties of the same species.&lt;/p&gt;
""><SUP id=""ss-4"">4</SUP></A></P><P>This last winter, middle Georgia got about 400 chill hours during what Chavez described as the usual dormancy period for peaches (roughly Oct. 1 to Feb. 10). The winter before, while still on the low side, had closer to 600 chill hours. But that 200-hour difference meant several peach varieties that had produced fruit in 2016 never bloomed this year. There are products and techniques that can help stimulate delayed crops, but this year the deficit in chill hours was too large to overcome, Chavez said.</P><P>A chill-hour deficit hits places with milder <mark>climate</mark>s, such as the southeastern U.S. and California, especially hard because they get fewer chill hours to begin with.</P><P>But Georgia was not the only place with a chill-hour deficit in the last year. According to an analysis by the Midwestern Regional <mark>Climate</mark> Center’s <A href=""http://mrcc.isws.illinois.edu/VIP/index.html"">Vegetation Impact Program</A>, most of the U.S. got fewer chill hours than the average from 1998 to 2013.<A class=""espn-footnote-link"" data-footnote-id=""5"" href=""#fn-5"" data-footnote-content=""&lt;p&gt;Colder than normal winters can also lower the number of chill hours if there are more hours below the lower threshold, for example, in the Pacific Northwest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oregonlive.com/weather/index.ssf/2017/02/oregons_winter_of_2016-17_wont.html&quot;&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
""><SUP id=""ss-5"">5</SUP></A></P><P><mark>Climate change</mark>, and the loss in winter chill that can come with it, poses a particular threat to fruit and nut trees and the farmers who depend on them, said Eike Luedeling, a senior scientist at the University of Bonn’s <A href=""https://www.zef.de/zefhome/"">Center for Development Research</A>. Farmers who grow annual crops, such as corn and wheat, replant every year and might be able to adapt more nimbly to a sudden change in the environment, by changing their planting schedule or switching crops (though doing so may be costly). But fruit and nut farmers rely on plants that take much longer than a single growing season to be productive. “You really have to plan for several decades ahead when you plant a tree,” said Luedeling, who <A href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006166"">has</A><A href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020155"">modelled</A> what winter chill hours may look like in the future. “It’s a huge investment.”</P><P>Looking ahead, the experience of Georgia peach farmers this year might become more common. <A href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006166"">Luedeling predicts</A> only about a quarter to a half of California’s Central Valley, which <A href=""https://naturalresources.house.gov/newsroom/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=368934"">produces much</A> of America’s fruit and nut crops, still will have enough chill hours by the middle of the 21st century to grow walnuts, apricots, plums and most varieties of peaches and nectarines.<A class=""espn-footnote-link"" data-footnote-id=""6"" href=""#fn-6"" data-footnote-content=""&lt;p&gt;These crops generally need a minimum of 700 winter chill hours&lt;/p&gt;
""><SUP id=""ss-6"">6</SUP></A> A <A href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020155"">separate, global projection</A> from Luedeling shows that while colder areas may not change much over the next century (or may even gain winter chill hours, thanks to more days above freezing), warm areas are likely to see dramatic reductions in chill hours.</P><P>Though concerning, these projections are far from certain, Luedeling said. There is still a lot we don’t know about winter chill. Anything above 45 degrees does not count toward the chill hour total in most models, but that threshold is almost certainly not as firm for plants themselves. As Luedeling put it, the cutoff doesn’t “have much biology in it,” but he hopes to build a better model soon that will help fruit producers plan for the future.</P><P>Meanwhile, farmers must make decisions now about their plans for the next few years. Peach growers and researchers, for their part, are focused on moving toward varieties that need fewer chill hours to thrive. Chavez, who works closely with growers, some of whose families have been growing peaches in Georgia for three to four generations, said that the time to make changes is now. “The weather is something we cannot control,” he said, but peach farming “is part of the region…. We have to address [it] sooner or later.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV class=""entry-footnotes print-only""><H2>Footnotes</H2><DIV class=""entry-footnotes-content""><OL class=""footnotes""><LI data-wrap=""false"" data-footnote-id=""1"" id=""fn-1""><SPAN><P>The Georgia peach season typically runs through mid-August</P></SPAN></LI><LI data-wrap=""false"" data-footnote-id=""2"" id=""fn-2""><SPAN><P>Once a tree has had the minimum amount of chill it needs, it knows to get ready to wake up again and clean out the compounds that have protected it through the winter.

Here are top ten highlights  of Georgia  Pacific’s sustainability and clean technology highlights.</P><P><STRONG>1) In 2009, <A href=""http://www.gp.com/newsroom/newsarticle.asp?newsid=7857"" target=""_blank""><mark>Georgia Pacific</mark> was named the Winner of the United States Environmental Protection Agency Smartway Excellence Award</A></STRONG>.   This award recognizes <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark> for its amazing environmental   performance. The award is a partnership between the Environmental   Protection Agency and the freight industry and is designed to boost <A href=""http://blog.cleantechies.com/category/energy/energy-efficiency/"" target=""_blank"">energy efficiency</A> while reducing total air <mark>pollution</mark>. Some of the highlights achieved by   <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark> in the areas of fuel savings, energy efficiency and   environmental impact include increasing intermodal shipping thereby   reducing fuel consumption, reducing the total number of miles traveled   between manufacturing points and customer delivery, and utilizing   specialized software to assist in better packing loads, ensuring maximum   space is used and reducing the total number of transport trucks on the   road.</P><P><STRONG>2) <A href=""http://www.gp.com/build/builditbetter/sustainability.aspx"" target=""_blank"">All of <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark>’s Wood Products</A> are procured according to the <mark>Sustainable</mark> Forest Initiative standards</STRONG>.   <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark> does not believe in wasting when it comes to trees.  All  manufacturing facilities utilize the most advanced technologies in  an  effort to identify the best and most effective route to cutting each  log  to optimize full product yield. Even the wood and bark residuals  are  reused to run all operations by turning it into biomass fuels.  Their <A href=""http://blog.cleantechies.com/category/energy/renewables/biomass/"" target=""_blank"">biomass</A> fuels have reduced the company’s overall dependence on fossil fuels as well as purchased electricity.</P><P><STRONG>3) All <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark> engineered lumber as well as their structural panel products <A href=""http://www.gp.com/build/BPContent.aspx?elementId=9977&amp;repository=bp#sust_nahbrc"" target=""_blank"">have been Green Approved by the National Association of Home Builders Research Center</A></STRONG>.   For consumers of <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark> products, this means that all  plywood,  lumber and OSB comply strictly with all green practice  criteria listed  in the National Green Building Standard.</P><P><STRONG>4) In January of 2010, <A href=""http://www.gp.com/build/newsRelease.aspx?NewsID=8088"" target=""_blank""><mark>Georgia Pacific</mark> Demonstrated its Sustainability Commitment with the Achievement of <mark>Sustainable</mark> Forest Initiative Certifications</A></STRONG>.   Obtaining these SFI certifications is an important part of our ongoing   commitment to the responsible use of natural resources,” said Caryn   King, director of marketing, Georgia-Pacific Wood Products. “We are   confident that the certifications will help us service the increasing   market demand for forest products from responsible sources and will   provide our customers with additional support as they make <mark>sustainable</mark>   choices about the building products they use,” stated King. “That’s a   win for our business, our customers, and our forests.” The <mark>Sustainable</mark>   Forest Initiative certification program is one of the most widely   recognized ones around the world and is based on measures and principles   aimed at promoting sound forest management.</P><P><STRONG>5) The <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark> Clean Bus Program works alongside the   Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that students in 11 public   schools throughout Georgia have a much healthier and cleaner ride every   day</STRONG>. The goal of the program is to hinder air <mark>pollution</mark> as  well  as reduce the exposure children have to diesel exhaust. Georgia  Pacific  invested over $3.5 million to assist in jump starting the  retrofit  program. Currently, over one-thousand buses have received  retrofit  treatments, with 706 coming from <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark> Funds.  “School systems  are reporting the buses are much cleaner, operate as  well or better than  prior to the retrofit installations, and have  eliminated most of the  diesel smell inside and outside the bus,” said  Lawrence Otwell, senior  environmental consultant</P><P><STRONG>6) <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark> is known for using a number of Energy Sources to run all the mills and plants.</STRONG> Aside from fossil fuels, <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark> is known for using biomass and   co-generation. The company selected fuel sources that will aid them in   operating their facilities in an efficient and effective manner.  Biomass  accounts for approximately 55 percent of the company’s total  energy  use, including bark, wood residues and tree by-products from  pulping in  order to produce <A href=""http://blog.cleantechies.com/category/energy/renewables/"" target=""_blank"">renewable energy</A> for all paper and wood manufacturing facilities. All emissions created   during the biomass production are <mark>carbon</mark> neutral and do not contribute   to additional <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide gasses.</P><P><STRONG>7) When it comes to Energy Metrics, <mark>Georgia pacific</mark>   self-generates a majority of its electricity from on-site electrical   turbines via co-generation</STRONG>. Self generated electricity rose   from 172,900 to 176,900 billion of Btus from 2006 to 2009. Total   purchased energy, on the other hand, went down by over 600 billion of   Btus from 2006 to 2009. The purchased energy is minimal fossil fuels and   electricity from the grid as well as purchased biofuels.</P><P><STRONG>8 ) <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark>’s tissue mill in The Netherlands has an   Updated Wastewater Treatment System to Meet all Environmental Standards</STRONG>.   Using some smart planning, The Netherlands-based mill not only  improved  the efficiency of the treatment system to comply with all new   regulations but it also optimized the utilization of biogas as a main   energy source for all steam boilers. “The wastewater treatment system   upgrade included new controls to better manage the flow of water through   the system. A steady flow of wastewater helps ensure that it is  cleaned  to the proper levels before being released. The mill also  installed a  recirculation system to clean the water even more  thoroughly. This  resulted in fewer pollutants being discharged to the  local municipal  treatment system.”</P><P><STRONG>9) There are many ways that <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark> practices <mark>Sustainable</mark> Forestry</STRONG>.   Aside from having all wood fiber procured under the certified   requirements of the <mark>Sustainable</mark> Forestry Initiative, <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark>   states that over 80 percent of all the wood purchased comes directly   from family forest landowners. A majority of <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark> products   have the SFI fiber sourcing on-product label. Numerous boxes carry these   labels, ensuring customers of <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark>’s commitment to   <mark>sustainable</mark> packaging. In a last example, <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark> has been   working with a number of environmental non-profit organizations to   better understand endangered forests and how to not source from these   forests.</P><P><STRONG>10) <mark>Georgia Pacific</mark> is involved in a number of <mark>Sustainable</mark> Building Products</STRONG> because they known that <mark>sustainable</mark> (green) building provides   environmental and economic benefits by being durable and energy   efficient. This saves on costs and increases the efficiency of   resources, thereby encouraging conservation. For example, Nautilus Wall   Sheathing combines building wrap and oriented strand board structural   sheathing into one great product.</P><P><EM>Article by Shawn Lesser, Co-founder &amp; Managing Partner of Atlanta-based <A href=""http://www.watershedcapital.com/Index/Home.html"" target=""_blank"">Watershed Capital Group</A> – an investment bank assisting <mark>sustainable</mark> fund and companies raise   capital, perform acquisitions, and in other strategic financial   decisions.

The company and its principal owners, brothers David and Charles Koch, have long been vocal about their support for conservative causes.</P><P>The announcement, which bore the Koch logo and was hosted at a site that looked like Koch’s, with a similar domain name to Koch’s, said the company would cut off its financing to Tea Party and conservative groups such as <A href=""http://www.americansforprosperity.org/national-site"">Americans for Prosperity</A> and the <A href=""http://www.fraserinstitute.org/"">Fraser Institute</A>. The activities of those groups, the hoax release said, “could jeopardize America’s continued global competitiveness in the energy and chemical sectors and Koch Industries’ ability to provide high-quality products and services to the American people.”</P><P>Koch hit back with a <A href=""http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/greeninc/koch_complaint.pdf"">lawsuit</A> claiming trademark infringement, cybersquatting and unfair competition.</P><P>But on Wednesday, Public Citizen filed a <A href=""http://www.citizen.org/documents/Koch_v_Does_Motion_to_Quash_Subpoenas.pdf"">motion</A> to have Koch’s lawsuit dismissed.

Its $21 billion acquisition of paper company Georgia-Pacific – maker of Quilted Northern, Angel Soft, Brawny and Dixie products – was the largest purchase of a public company by a private firm in U.S. history, Koch says.</P><P>The Public Citizen motion says that lawyers for Koch have issued subpoenas to two Utah-based internet companies, Bluehost and FastDomain, in an attempt to discover the pranksters’ identities.</P><P>A statement on Koch’s website says, “Koch Industries, Inc. is a firm believer in our nation’s First Amendment and the right to free speech. This lawsuit was filed in response to a willful act of identity theft, theft of intellectual property, and impersonation that extends beyond the boundaries of free speech.</P><P>“It was a publicity and fund raising stunt perpetrated with the intent to deceive and confuse the public, and disrupt and harm Koch Industries’ business and reputation.”</P><P>Other non-profits are also targeting Koch.

Sonny Perdue, is drawing opposition from conservationists and <mark>climate</mark> activists, who are concerned about Perdue's ties to the timber industry and his dismissal of <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/<mark>climate</mark>-change""><mark>climate change</mark></A> science.</P><P>Perdue comes from Georgia, one of the country's biggest timber states, at the heart of a region that cuts and sells more wood than any other on the planet—the &quot;<A href=""https://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/9647"">wood basket</A>&quot; of the world. A woodland owner himself, Perdue <A href=""http://www.nationalreview.com/article/377495/common-core-blame-game-sonny-perdue"">has questioned</A> the link between extreme weather and <mark>climate change</mark>, has taken campaign funding from the timber industry and has been a booster of converting wood to ethanol, with potential <mark>climate</mark> consequences.</P><P>That, conservationists say, could spell a worsening situation for the 193 million acres under the control of the U.S. Forest Service, which is within the Department of Agriculture. Those woodlands provide habitat for wildlife, purify drinking water for millions of people and absorb <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, keeping it from warming the atmosphere. That gives the forests a critical role in addressing <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;The concern is we'll go back to the Reagan days—of billions of board feet of wood coming out of the national forests,&quot; said Mark Woodall, the legislative chair of the Sierra Club's Georgia chapter. &quot;There's a concern that Sonny Perdue has always been close to the timber companies and would be favorable to them.&quot;</P><P>The Department of Agriculture has nearly three dozen agencies and offices under its sprawling mandate, overseeing everything from school nutrition programs to crop insurance to the forest service.</P><P>The timber industry has largely backed Perdue's nomination, which this week also earned the nod of Tom Vilsack, Obama's secretary of agriculture.</P><P>The American Forest Foundation, which endorses forest management strategies at odds with some conservationists, is <A href=""https://www.forestfoundation.org/aff-applauds-ag-nomination"">also backing</A> Perdue.</P><P>&quot;He's been a big leader in expanding forests to markets,&quot; said Tom Martin, the foundation's president and CEO. &quot;Many of the threats to forest—drought, fire, invasive species—can be hedged against through smart management.&quot;</P><P>But conservation groups argue that these management techniques, which include thinning forests to remove fire-feeding, hazardous overgrowth and prescribed burns, are a means for the timber industry to gain access to valuable federal lands.</P><P>&quot;That has been used by timber companies as a backdoor into destroying habitat,&quot; said Rachel Cleetus, a senior scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists' <mark>climate</mark> and energy program. &quot;The challenge is finding the balance of doing this with certain criteria in place.&quot;</P><P>Those criteria, conservation groups say, are under threat as Republicans and the Trump administration attempt to roll back environmental review processes.</P><P>&quot;Undoubtedly there will be a lot of pressure on [Perdue] to open up more national forest to logging, said Alan Rowsome, senior government relations director at The Wilderness Society. &quot;Conservatives in Congress are looking to ways to incentivize more timber, cutting back regulations and rules that are designed to protect the American public's interest in making sure those lands are available. He's going to have to deal with that push-and-pull.&quot;</P><P>Perdue made the rounds on Capitol Hill last week, meeting with senators who he'll face in a confirmation hearing, which has not yet been scheduled. They <A href=""https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=595"">discussed opening</A> up more federal lands to timber. Perdue's cousin, Sen. David Perdue, (R-Ga.), heads the subcommittee that oversees forestry under the Senate Agriculture Committee.</P><P>If confirmed, Perdue will help craft the agency's budget and steer its priorities. Yet more important, perhaps, is his choice for deputy undersecretary for natural resources and environment. That person directly oversees the operations of the Forest Service.</P><P>&quot;That person will really run the Forest Service. We hope he thinks long and hard about that, and it's not someone whose background is in timber or logging,&quot; Rowsome said. &quot;That will send a big signal about what his philosophy will be on national forests.&quot;</P><P>Perdue did not respond to requests for comment.</P><H2>Perdue's Record in Georgia</H2><P>During his first term as governor, Perdue quickly angered forest conservation groups. He killed the land conservation program started by his predecessor and replaced it with one that allowed continued harvesting of trees on rural lands where the state had bought development rights.</P><P>In 2004, the Nature Conservancy offered to buy a huge tract of forest once owned by timber giant Weyerhaeuser, if the state agreed to compensate the group for the purchase later. Perdue refused to sign the agreement, saying the state couldn't afford it. The land, known as Oaky Woods and adjacent to one of Perdue's own pieces of land, instead was sold to developers for $1,600 an acre. The Atlanta-Journal Constitution reported that the value of Perdue's property nearly doubled. Six years later and a month before Perdue left office, the state bought 10,000 acres of the property for nearly $3,000 an acre—more than twice the 2004 price.</P><P>&quot;Sonny killed Gov. Roy Barnes' green space program,&quot; Woodall explained. &quot;That and Oaky Woods doesn't inspire much confidence in Sonny Perdue's stewardship of 193 millions acres of national forest.&quot;</P><P>Perdue signed into law the Forest Land Protection Act in 2008, which lowered the taxes on owners of large tracts of forest, including corporations. Under the previous law, only those who owned 2,000 acres could qualify for the tax relief, prompting big timber companies, including Georgia-Pacific and Weyerhaeuser to sell off their Georgia plantations.  </P><P>&quot;During his tenure as governor of the state of Georgia, Gov. Sonny Perdue was a supporter and effective advocate for the forest business. One example was his leadership in having the Forest Land Protection Act signed into law,&quot; said Joe Hopkins, a former president of the Georgia Forestry Association and timberland owner<A href=""http://gfagrow.org/trump-selects-former-georgia-governor-sonny-perdue-as-agriculture-secretary/""> in a statement</A>. &quot;He will bring to this position his understanding that forestry is inclusive within the term 'agriculture' rather than exclusive.&quot;</P><P>Forest conservation groups fear exactly that.</P><P>&quot;Gov. Perdue and the timber industry cite sources saying we've increased the number of trees and acres of forests,&quot; said Adam Macon, of the North Carolina-based forest conservation group Dogwood Alliance. &quot;But what's really happened in the past 50 years is we've seen a decrease of over 30 million acres of natural forest in the U.S. south, and an increase of over 40 million acres of pine plantation. We're turning our forests into an industrial crop being grown for Big Timber.&quot;</P><H2>The Raging Wildfire Debate</H2><P>Fueled by <mark>climate change</mark>, wildfires have become a worsening problem over the past 10 years, particularly across the western U.S., fueled by tinder-dry forests and parched conditions. Five of the worst fire seasons in history have occurred since 2006. Mega-fires, those that burn more than 100,000 acres, are seven times more likely now than they were 40 years ago.</P><P>Fighting these fires has come at a huge cost. For the<A href=""https://www.fs.fed.us/sites/default/files/2015-Fire-Budget-Report.pdf""> first time in 2015</A>, the Forest Service reported that more than half of its budget—nearly $2 billion—went toward fighting fires, and that by 2025 that percent would rise to two-thirds.</P><P>&quot;We have these increasingly bad wildfire seasons, especially in the West, driven by <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; Cleetus explained. &quot;Every year the fire-fighting budget gets exhausted and they have to move money around from other parts of the budget.&quot;</P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> is exacerbating conditions created by the Forest Service's policy, at least historically, of aggressively fighting fires in the first place. When fires are quenched and not allowed to burn naturally, a forest's underbrush remains as food for future fires.</P><P>Congress has tried to pass legislation that would boost the service's budget, but recent attempts have stalled, largely because Democrats have opposed language that would reduce the level of environmental reviews required for managing forests.</P><P>Regardless of Perdue's approach and philosophy—or those of his undersecretary—he will at least be forced to consider the role of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;It's hard to look at the wildfire issue without discussing <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; said Peter Nelson, director of the federal lands program for Defenders of Wildlife. &quot;It's so ingrained in the agency's conservation and management decisions.&quot;</P><H2>Turning Forests Into Fuel</H2><P>When forests are burned, they release huge amounts of <mark>carbon</mark> into the atmosphere. One study suggested that burning biomass, including plants and trees, is linked to 18 percent of human-caused global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. In California alone, wildfires accounted for between 5 and 7 percent of the state's overall <mark>carbon</mark> emissions between 2001-10.</P><P>But wildfires are only part of the <mark>carbon</mark> equation. Cutting trees and burning them for energy or fuel complicate the picture.</P><P>The timber industry <A href=""http://www.awc.org/publicpolicy/biomass"">has long argued</A> that timber can provide a <mark>sustainable</mark> form of energy with its potential for conversion into biofuels, that wood waste from Georgia's abundant pine can be turned into liquid fuel.</P><P>No company has yet figured out how to scale up production of wood-based ethanol, but the timber industry is still pushing.</P><P>&quot;The industry has been pushing this idea of biomass for many years and the industry's political friends, which include Perdue, have taken up this mantra that forests are fuel,&quot; said Kevin Bundy, senior attorney for the California-based advocacy group, Center for Biological Diversity. &quot;But from our perspective we shouldn't be throwing billions of dollars at turning forests into fuels, when options like wind and solar are on the shelf.&quot;</P><P>While the forest industry considers burning wood to be <mark>carbon</mark> neutral and wood a renewable resource, burning wood for power, <A href=""http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/debunking_the_biomass_myth/"">Bundy explained</A>, releases more <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide than burning coal. It can also take decades or centuries before a regrown or replanted forest can store the same amount of <mark>carbon</mark> as the original forest.</P><P>&quot;We need forests for habitat, for water, for <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration, for protection from natural disasters, from storm surge,&quot; Macon, of the Dogwood Alliance said. &quot;Pine plantations do a pittance compared to what a natural forest does. Sonny Perdue is a big proponent of treating forests as a crop, and ignoring those benefits.&quot;</P><P>The forestry community—both on the conservation and timber industry sides of the complex debate over how best to manage federal forests—will carefully watch Perdue's confirmation hearing, which should come in the next few weeks.   </P><P>&quot;What we hear in these hearings is going to be critical,&quot; Rowsome said. &quot;There's reason to have some optimism, but we're going to need to hear it from him that he values wildlife, recreation, and water protection. It would be difficult to affirm those values and say he also wants to grow board feet coming out of the national forest.&quot;</P><P><EM>Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the U.S. South had lost 30 million acres of national forest. It has lost that amount of natural forests.</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""tagged-with""><LABEL>Published Under:</LABEL></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It was the seventieth annual spring gala of American Ballet Theatre, and David H. Koch was being celebrated for his generosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated $2.5 million toward the company’s upcoming season, and had given many millions before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the gala’s co-chairs, Blaine Trump, in a peach-colored gown, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, in emerald green. Kennedy’s mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, had been a patron of the ballet and, coincidentally, the previous owner of a Fifth Avenue apartment that Koch had bought, in 1995, and then sold, eleven years later, for thirty-two million dollars, having found it too small.</P><P>The gala marked the social ascent of Koch, who, at the age of seventy, has become one of the city’s most prominent philanthropists. In 2008, he donated a hundred million dollars to modernize Lincoln Center’s New York State Theatre building, which now bears his name. He has given twenty million to the American Museum of Natural History, whose dinosaur wing is named for him. This spring, after noticing the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Koch pledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation. He is a trustee of the museum, perhaps the most coveted social prize in the city, and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where, after he donated more than forty million dollars, an endowed chair and a research center were named for him.</P><P>One dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the event’s third honorary co-chair, Michelle Obama. Her office said that a scheduling conflict had prevented her from attending. Yet had the First Lady shared the stage with Koch it might have created an awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch is best known as part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealth attacks on the federal government, and on the Obama Administration in particular.</P><P>With his brother Charles, who is seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually all of Koch Industries, a conglomerate, headquartered in Wichita, Kansas, whose annual revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company has grown spectacularly since their father, Fred, died, in 1967, and the brothers took charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries in Alaska, Texas, and Minnesota, and control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper towels, Dixie cups, Georgia-Pacific lumber, Stainmaster carpet, and Lycra, among other products. <EM>Forbes</EM> ranks it as the second-largest private company in the country, after Cargill, and its consistent profitability has made David and Charles Koch—who, years ago, bought out two other brothers—among the richest men in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars is exceeded only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.</P><P>The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services for the needy, and much less oversight of industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail with the brothers’ corporate interests. In a study released this spring, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst’s Political Economy Research Institute named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States. And Greenpeace issued a report identifying the company as a “kingpin of <mark>climate</mark> science denial.” The report showed that, from 2005 to 2008, the Kochs vastly outdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related to <mark>climate change</mark>, underwriting a huge network of foundations, think tanks, and political front groups. Indeed, the brothers have funded opposition campaigns against so many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform to the economic-stimulus program—that, in political circles, their ideological network is known as the Kochtopus.</P><P>In a statement, Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report “distorts the environmental record of our companies.” And David Koch, in a recent, admiring article about him in <EM>New York,</EM> protested that the “radical press” had turned his family into “whipping boys,” and had exaggerated its influence on American politics. But Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said, “The Kochs are on a whole different level. There’s no one else who has spent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political manipulation, and obfuscation. I’ve been in Washington since Watergate, and I’ve never seen anything like it. They are the Standard Oil of our times.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7""><P>A few weeks after the Lincoln Center gala, the advocacy wing of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation—an organization that David Koch started, in 2004—held a different kind of gathering. Over the July 4th weekend, a summit called Texas Defending the American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin. Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventures, he did not attend the summit, and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was roused not by a dance performance but by a series of speakers denouncing President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, the organizer of the summit, warned that Administration officials “have a socialist vision for this country.”</P><P>Five hundred people attended the summit, which served, in part, as a training session for Tea Party activists in Texas. An advertisement cast the event as a populist uprising against vested corporate power. “Today, the voices of average Americans are being drowned out by lobbyists and special interests,” it said. “But you can do something about it.” The pitch made no mention of its corporate funders. The White House has expressed frustration that such sponsors have largely eluded public notice. David Axelrod, Obama’s senior adviser, said, “What they don’t say is that, in part, this is a grassroots citizens’ movement brought to you by a bunch of oil billionaires.”</P><P>In April, 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, a company spokesperson, denied that the Kochs had direct links to the Tea Party, saying that Americans for Prosperity is “an independent organization and Koch companies do not in any way direct their activities.” Later, she issued a statement: “No funding has been provided by Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch or David Koch specifically to support the tea parties.” David Koch told <EM>New York</EM>, “I’ve never been to a tea-party event. No one representing the tea party has ever even approached me.”</P><P>At the lectern in Austin, however, Venable—a longtime political operative who draws a salary from Americans for Prosperity, and who has worked for Koch-funded political groups since 1994—spoke less warily. “We love what the Tea Parties are doing, because that’s how we’re going to take back America!” she declared, as the crowd cheered. In a subsequent interview, she described herself as an early member of the movement, joking, “I was part of the Tea Party before it was cool!” She explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help “educate” Tea Party activists on policy details, and to give them “next-step training” after their rallies, so that their political energy could be channelled “more effectively.” And she noted that Americans for Prosperity had provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said of the Kochs, “They’re certainly our people. David’s the chairman of our board. I’ve certainly met with them, and I’m very appreciative of what they do.”</P><P>Venable honored several Tea Party “citizen leaders” at the summit. The Texas branch of Americans for Prosperity gave its Blogger of the Year Award to a young woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th, West, writing on her site, described Obama as the “cokehead in chief.” In an online thread, West speculated that the President was exhibiting symptoms of “demonic possession (aka schizophrenia, etc.).” The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, the actress best known for her role on the television series “Northern Exposure.” She declared, “They don’t want our children to know about their rights. They don’t want our children to know about a God!”</P><P>During a catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general of Texas, who told the crowd that Obama was “the most radical President ever to occupy the Oval Office,” and had hidden from voters a secret agenda—“the government taking over our economy and our lives.” Countering Obama, Cruz proclaimed, was “the epic fight of our generation!” As the crowd rose to its feet and cheered, he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: “Victory, or death!”</P><P>Americans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the movement’s inception. In the weeks before the first Tax Day protests, in April, 2009, Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters “Tea Party Talking Points.” The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the Missouri branch urged members to sign up for “Taxpayer Tea Party Registration” and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the rebellion. The North Carolina branch recently launched a “Tea Party Finder” Web site, advertised as “a hub for all the Tea Parties in North Carolina.”</P><P>The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to “educate,” fund, and organize Tea Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement. Bruce Bartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based think tank that the Kochs fund, said, “The problem with the whole libertarian movement is that it’s been all chiefs and no Indians. There haven’t been any actual people, like voters, who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has been trying to create a movement.” With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said, “everyone suddenly sees that for the first time there are Indians out there—people who can provide real ideological power.” The Kochs, he said, are “trying to shape and control and channel the populist uprising into their own policies.”</P><P>A Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and David Koch said of the Tea Party, “The Koch brothers gave the money that founded it. It’s like they put the seeds in the ground. Then the rainstorm comes, and the frogs come out of the mud—and they’re our candidates!”</P><P>The Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews. Instead, a prominent New York public-relations executive who is close with the Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, the former governor of New York, and Mortimer Zuckerman, the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki, a Republican who received campaign donations from David Koch, called him “a patriot who cares deeply about his country.” Zuckerman praised David’s “gentle decency” and the “range of his public interests.”</P><P>The Republican campaign consultant said of the family’s political activities, “To call them under the radar is an understatement. They are underground!” Another former Koch adviser said, “They’re smart. This right-wing, redneck stuff works for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty themselves.” Rob Stein, a Democratic political strategist who has studied the conservative movement’s finances, said that the Kochs are “at the epicenter of the anti-Obama movement. But it’s not just about Obama. They would have done the same to Hillary Clinton. They did the same with Bill Clinton. They are out to destroy progressivism.”</P><DIV class=""Callout__inset-left___2rZjf"" data-type=""callout"" data-callout=""inset-left""><DIV class=""CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM ""><A class=""Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW "" href=""https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a15208""><FIGURE class=""Figure__figure___U_9Te  ""><FIGCAPTION class=""ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5""><SPAN class=""ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO"">“You’re depressed?

Fred Koch was the son of a Dutch printer who settled in Texas and ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended M.I.T., where he earned a degree in chemical engineering. In 1927, he invented a more efficient process for converting oil into gasoline, but, according to family lore, America’s major oil companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to succeed at home, Koch found work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties, his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin’s regime set up fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged several of Koch’s Soviet colleagues. Koch was deeply affected by the experience, and regretted his collaboration. He returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of his company, Rock Island Oil &amp; Refining, in Wichita, he kept photographs aimed at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had been destroyed in the Second World War. Gus diZerega, a former friend of Charles Koch, recalled, “As the Soviets became a stronger military power, Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot.”</P><P>In 1958, Fred Koch became one of the original members of the John Birch Society, the arch-conservative group known, in part, for a highly skeptical view of governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered President Dwight D. Eisenhower to be a Communist agent. In a self-published broadside, Koch claimed that “the Communists have infiltrated both the Democrat and Republican Parties.” He wrote admiringly of Benito Mussolini’s suppression of Communists in Italy, and disparagingly of the American civil-rights movement. “The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to take over America,” he warned. Welfare was a secret plot to attract rural blacks to cities, where they would foment “a vicious race war.” In a 1963 speech that prefigures the Tea Party’s talk of a secret socialist plot, Koch predicted that Communists would “infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is a Communist, unknown to the rest of us.”</P><P>Koch married Mary Robinson, the daughter of a Missouri physician, and they had four sons: Freddie, Charles, and twins, David and William. John Damgard, the president of the Futures Industry Association, was David’s schoolmate and friend. He recalled that Fred Koch was “a real John Wayne type.” Koch emphasized rugged pursuits, taking his sons big-game hunting in Africa, and requiring them to do farm labor at the family ranch. The Kochs lived in a stone mansion on a large compound across from Wichita’s country club; in the summer, the boys could hear their friends splashing in the pool, but they were not allowed to join them. “By instilling a work ethic in me at an early age, my father did me a big favor, although it didn’t seem like a favor back then,” Charles has written. “By the time I was eight, he made sure work occupied most of my spare time.” David Koch recalled that his father also indoctrinated the boys politically. “He was constantly speaking to us children about what was wrong with government,” he told Brian Doherty, an editor of the libertarian magazine <EM>Reason</EM>, and the author of “Radicals for Capitalism,” a 2007 history of the libertarian movement. “It’s something I grew up with—a fundamental point of view that big government was bad, and imposition of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes was not good.”</P><P>David attended Deerfield Academy, in Massachusetts, and Charles was sent to military school. Charles, David, and William all earned engineering degrees at their father’s alma mater, M.I.T., and later joined the family company. Charles eventually assumed control, with David as his deputy; William’s career at the company was less successful. Freddie went to Harvard and studied playwriting at the Yale School of Drama. His father reportedly disapproved of him, and punished him financially. (Freddie, through a spokesperson, denied this.)</P><P>In 1967, after Fred Koch died, of a heart attack, Charles renamed the business Koch Industries, in honor of his father. Fred Koch’s will made his sons extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked about his good fortune in a 2003 speech to alumni at Deerfield, where, after pledging twenty-five million dollars, he was made the school’s sole “lifetime trustee.” He said, “You might ask: How does David Koch happen to have the wealth to be so generous? Well, let me tell you a story. It all started when I was a little boy. One day, my father gave me an apple. I soon sold it for five dollars and bought two apples and sold them for ten. Then I bought four apples and sold them for twenty. Well, this went on day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, until my father died and left me three hundred million dollars!”</P><P>David and Charles had absorbed their father’s conservative politics, but they did not share all his views, according to diZerega, who befriended Charles in the mid-sixties, after meeting him while browsing in a John Birch Society bookstore in Wichita. Charles eventually invited him to the Kochs’ mansion, to participate in an informal political-discussion group. “It was pretty clear that Charles thought some of the Birch Society was bullshit,” diZerega recalled.</P><P>DiZerega, who has lost touch with Charles, eventually abandoned right-wing views, and became a political-science professor. He credits Charles with opening his mind to political philosophy, which set him on the path to academia; Charles is one of three people to whom he dedicated his first book. But diZerega believes that the Koch brothers have followed a wayward intellectual trajectory, transferring their father’s paranoia about Soviet Communism to a distrust of the U.S. government, and seeing its expansion, beginning with the New Deal, as a tyrannical threat to freedom. In an essay, posted on Beliefnet, diZerega writes, “As state socialism failed . . . the target for many within these organizations shifted to any kind of regulation at all. ‘Socialism’ kept being defined downwards.”</P><P>Members of the John Birch Society developed an interest in a school of Austrian economists who promoted free-market ideals. Charles and David Koch were particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von Hayek, the author of “The Road to Serfdom” (1944), which argued that centralized government planning led, inexorably, to totalitarianism. Hayek’s belief in unfettered capitalism has proved inspirational to many conservatives, and to anti-Soviet dissidents; lately, Tea Party supporters have championed his work. In June, the talk-radio host Glenn Beck, who has supported the Tea Party rebellion, promoted “The Road to Serfdom” on his show; the paperback soon became a No. 1 best-seller on Amazon. (Beck appears to be a fan of the Kochs; in the midst of a recent on-air parody of Al Gore, Beck said, without explanation, “I want to thank Charles Koch for this information.” Beck declined to elaborate on the relationship.)</P><P>Charles and David also became devotees of a more radical thinker, Robert LeFevre, who favored the abolition of the state but didn’t like the label “anarchist”; he called himself an “autarchist.” LeFevre liked to say that “government is a disease masquerading as its own cure.” In 1956, he opened an institution called the Freedom School, in Colorado Springs. Brian Doherty, of <EM>Reason</EM>, told me that “LeFevre was an anarchist figure who won Charles’s heart,” and that the school was “a tiny world of people who thought the New Deal was a horrible mistake.” According to diZerega, Charles supported the school financially, and even gave him money to take classes there.</P><P>Throughout the seventies, Charles and David continued to build Koch Industries. In 1980, William, with assistance from Freddie, attempted to take over the company from Charles, who, they felt, had assumed autocratic control. In retaliation, the company’s board, which answered to Charles, fired William. (“Charles runs it all with an iron hand,” Bruce Bartlett, the economist, told me.) Lawsuits were filed, with William and Freddie on one side and Charles and David on the other. In 1983, Charles and David bought out their brothers’ share in the company for nearly a billion dollars. But the antagonism remained, and litigation continued for seventeen more years, with the brothers hiring rival private investigators; in 1990, they walked past one another with stony expressions at their mother’s funeral. Eventually, Freddie moved to Monaco, which has no income tax. He bought historic estates in France, Austria, and elsewhere, filling them with art, antiques, opera scores, and literary manuscripts. William founded his own energy company, Oxbow, and turned to yachting; he spent an estimated sixty-five million dollars to win the America’s Cup, in 1992.</P><P>With Charles as the undisputed chairman and C.E.O., Koch Industries expanded rapidly. Roger Altman, who heads the investment-banking firm Evercore, told me that the company’s performance has been “beyond phenomenal.” Charles remained in Wichita, with his wife and two children, guarding his privacy while supporting community charities. David moved to New York City, where he is an executive vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. A financial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me, “Charles <EM>is</EM> the company. Charles runs it.” David, described by associates as “affable” and “a bit of a lunk,” enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. He rented a yacht in the South of France and bought a waterfront home in Southampton, where he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likened to an “East Coast version of Hugh Hefner’s soirées.” In 1996, he married Julia Flesher, a fashion assistant. They live in a nine-thousand-square-foot duplex at 740 Park Avenue, with their three children. Though David’s manner is more cosmopolitan, and more genial, than that of Charles, Brian Doherty, who has interviewed both brothers, couldn’t think of a single issue on which the brothers disagreed.</P><P>As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics in America. Charles’s goal, as Doherty described it, was to tear the government “out at the root.” The brothers’ first major public step came in 1979, when Charles persuaded David, then thirty-nine, to run for public office. They had become supporters of the Libertarian Party, and were backing its Presidential candidate, Ed Clark, who was running against Ronald Reagan from the right. Frustrated by the legal limits on campaign donations, they contrived to place David on the ticket, in the Vice-Presidential slot; upon becoming a candidate, he could lavish as much of his personal fortune as he wished on the campaign. The ticket’s slogan was “The Libertarian Party has only one source of funds: You.” In fact, its primary source of funds was David Koch, who spent more than two million dollars on the effort.</P><P>Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told <EM>The Nation</EM> that libertarians were getting ready to stage “a very big tea party,” because people were “sick to death” of taxes. The Libertarian Party platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., as well as of federal regulatory agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social Security, minimum-wage laws, gun control, and all personal and corporate income taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution, recreational drugs, and suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., a more traditional conservative, called the movement “Anarcho-Totalitarianism.”</P><P>That November, the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote. The brothers realized that their brand of politics didn’t sell at the ballot box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. “It tends to be a nasty, corrupting business,” he told a reporter at the time. “I’m interested in advancing libertarian ideas.” According to Doherty’s book, the Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely “actors playing out a script.” A longtime confidant of the Kochs told Doherty that the brothers wanted to “supply the themes and words for the scripts.” In order to alter the direction of America, they had to “influence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia and think tanks.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7""><P>After the 1980 election, Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena. But they poured more than a hundred million dollars into dozens of seemingly independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch family foundations gave money to thirty-four political and policy organizations, three of which they founded, and several of which they direct. The Kochs and their company have given additional millions to political campaigns, advocacy groups, and lobbyists. The family’s subterranean financial role has fuelled suspicion on the left; Lee Fang, of the liberal blog ThinkProgress, has called the Kochs “the billionaires behind the hate.”</P><DIV class=""Callout__inset-left___2rZjf"" data-type=""callout"" data-callout=""inset-left""><DIV class=""CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM ""><A class=""Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW "" href=""https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a15236""><FIGURE class=""Figure__figure___U_9Te  ""><FIGCAPTION class=""ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5""><SPAN class=""ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO"">“We’re not that well organized, but we know where everybody is.”</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></A></DIV></DIV><P>Only the Kochs know precisely how much they have spent on politics. Public tax records show that between 1998 and 2008 the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, which is controlled by Charles Koch and his wife, along with two company employees and an accountant, spent more than twenty-eight million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and twenty million. Meanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty million dollars on lobbying. Separately, the company’s political-action committee, Koch<EM class=""small"">PAC</EM>, has donated some eight million dollars to political campaigns, more than eighty per cent of it to Republicans. So far in 2010, Koch Industries leads all other energy companies in political contributions, as it has since 2006. In addition, during the past dozen years the Kochs and other family members have personally spent more than two million dollars on political contributions. In the second quarter of 2010, David Koch was the biggest individual contributor to the Republican Governors Association, with a million-dollar donation. Other gifts by the Kochs may be untraceable; federal tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politically active nonprofit groups.</P><P>In recent decades, members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of their fortunes on a conservative agenda. In the nineteen-eighties, the Olin family, which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate, became known for funding right-leaning thinking in academia, particularly in law schools. And during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife, a descendant of Andrew Mellon, spent millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. Ari Rabin-Havt, a vice-president at the Democratic-leaning Web site Media Matters, said that the Kochs’ effort is unusual, in its marshalling of corporate and personal funds: “Their role, in terms of financial commitments, is staggering.”</P><P>Of course, Democrats give money, too. Their most prominent donor, the financier George Soros, runs a foundation, the Open Society Institute, that has spent as much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made generous private contributions to various Democratic campaigns, including Obama’s. But Michael Vachon, his spokesman, argued that Soros’s giving is transparent, and that “none of his contributions are in the service of his own economic interests.” The Kochs have given millions of dollars to nonprofit groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for industry. Gus diZerega, the former friend, suggested that the Kochs’ youthful idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into a rationale for corporate self-interest. He said of Charles, “Perhaps he has confused making money with freedom.”</P><P>Some critics have suggested that the Kochs’ approach has subverted the purpose of tax-exempt giving. By law, charitable foundations must conduct exclusively nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group, described the Kochs’ foundations as being self-serving, concluding, “These foundations give money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that impact the profit margin of Koch Industries.”</P><P>The Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest, however, funding organizations that aim to push the country in a libertarian direction. Among the institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice, which files lawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for Humane Studies, which underwrites libertarian academics; and the Bill of Rights Institute, which promotes a conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the organizations funded by the Kochs employ specialists who write position papers that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch has acknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. “If we’re going to give a lot of money, we’ll make darn sure they spend it in a way that goes along with our intent,” he told Doherty. “And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things we don’t agree with, we withdraw funding.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7""><P>The Kochs’ subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills, in many ways, the vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo that Lewis Powell, then a Virginia attorney, wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The antiwar movement had turned its anger on defense contractors, such as Dow Chemical, and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interest crusade against corporations. Powell, writing a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged American companies to fight back. The greatest threat to free enterprise, he warned, was not Communism or the New Left but, rather, “respectable elements of society”—intellectuals, journalists, and scientists. To defeat them, he wrote, business leaders needed to wage a long-term, unified campaign to change public opinion.</P><P>Charles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the deliberation of an engineer. “To bring about social change,” he told Doherty, requires “a strategy” that is “vertically and horizontally integrated,” spanning “from idea creation to policy development to education to grassroots organizations to lobbying to litigation to political action.” The project, he admitted, was extremely ambitious. “We have a radical philosophy,” he said.</P><P>In 1977, the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nation’s first libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute. According to the Center for Public Integrity, between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the institute. Today, Cato has more than a hundred full-time employees, and its experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by the mainstream media. It describes itself as nonpartisan, and its scholars have at times been critical of both parties. But it has consistently pushed for corporate tax cuts, reductions in social services, and laissez-faire environmental policies.</P><P>When President Obama, in a 2008 speech, described the science on global warming as “beyond dispute,” the Cato Institute took out a full-page ad in the <EM>Times</EM> to contradict him. Cato’s resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political attempts to stop global warming as expensive, ineffective, and unnecessary. Ed Crane, the Cato Institute’s founder and president, told me that “global-warming theories give the government more control of the economy.”</P><P>Cato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the <mark>Climate</mark>gate scandal. Last year, private e-mails of <mark>climate</mark> scientists at the University of East Anglia, in England, were mysteriously leaked, and their exchanges appeared to suggest a willingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails went public, one Cato scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal. But five independent inquiries have since exonerated the researchers, and nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus on global warming.</P><P>Nevertheless, the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about <mark>climate change</mark>. Even though the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal, more Americans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. The Kochs promote this statistic on their company’s Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has played in fostering such doubt.</P><P>In a 2002 memo, the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that so long as “voters believe there is no consensus about global warming within the scientific community” the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of environmental reform, he said, was to question the science—a public-relations strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years to forestall regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental skepticism, such as the Heritage Foundation, which has argued that “scientific facts gathered in the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming.” The brothers have given money to more obscure groups, too, such as the Independent Women’s Forum, which opposes the presentation of global warming as a scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008, the group was run by Nancy Pfotenhauer, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis, a vice-president of a Koch subsidiary, is on the group’s board.</P><P>Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history and science studies at the University of California, San Diego, is the co-author of “Merchants of Doubt,” a new book that chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion on science. She noted that the Kochs, as the heads of “a company with refineries and pipelines,” have “a lot at stake.” She added, “If the answer is to phase out fossil fuels, a different group of people are going to be making money, so we shouldn’t be surprised that they’re fighting tooth and nail.”</P><P>David Koch told <EM>New York</EM> that he was unconvinced that global warming has been caused by human activity. Even if it has been, he said, the heating of the planet will be beneficial, resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. “The Earth will be able to support enormously more people because far greater land area will be available to produce food,” he said.</P></DIV><DIV class=""SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7""><P>In the mid-eighties, the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason University, in Arlington, Virginia, to set up another think tank. Now known as the Mercatus Center, it promotes itself as “the world’s premier university source for market-oriented ideas—bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems.” Financial records show that the Koch family foundations have contributed more than thirty million dollars to George Mason, much of which has gone to the Mercatus Center, a nonprofit organization. “It’s ground zero for deregulation policy in Washington,” Rob Stein, the Democratic strategist, said. It is an unusual arrangement. “George Mason is a public university, and receives public funds,” Stein noted. “Virginia is hosting an institution that the Kochs practically control.”</P><P>The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink, formerly an economist. Fink heads Koch Industries’ lobbying operation in Washington. In addition, he is the president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the president of the Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, a director of the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation, and a director and co-founder, with David Koch, of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation.</P><P>Fink, with his many titles, has become the central nervous system of the Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted Ed Crane, the head of the Cato Institute, as the brothers’ main political lieutenant. Though David remains on the board at Cato, Charles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles’s management philosophy, which he distilled into a book called “The Science of Success,” and trademarked under the name Market-Based Management, or M.B.M. In the book, Charles recommends instilling a company’s corporate culture with the competitiveness of the marketplace. Koch describes M.B.M. as a “holistic system” containing “five dimensions: vision, virtue and talents, knowledge processes, decision rights and incentives.” A top Cato Institute official told me that Charles “thinks he’s a genius. He’s the emperor, and he’s convinced he’s wearing clothes.” Fink, by contrast, has been far more embracing of Charles’s ideas. (Fink, like the Kochs, declined to be interviewed.)</P><P>At a 1995 conference for philanthropists, Fink adopted the language of economics when speaking about the Mercatus Center’s purpose. He said that grant-makers should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual raw materials into policy “products.”</P><P>The <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM> has called the Mercatus Center “the most important think tank you’ve never heard of,” and noted that fourteen of the twenty-three regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a “hit list” had been suggested first by Mercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have “other means of fighting [their] battles,” and that the Mercatus Center does not actively promote the company’s private interests. But Thomas McGarity, a law professor at the University of Texas, who specializes in environmental issues, told me that “Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A., and Mercatus has constantly hammered on the agency.” An environmental lawyer who has clashed with the Mercatus Center called it “a means of laundering economic aims.” The lawyer explained the strategy: “You take corporate money and give it to a neutral-sounding think tank,” which “hires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies. But they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders.”</P><P>In 1997, for instance, the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone, a form of <mark>pollution</mark> caused, in part, by emissions from oil refineries. Susan Dudley, an economist who became a top official at the Mercatus Center, criticized the proposed rule. The E.P.A., she argued, had not taken into account that smog-free skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected that if <mark>pollution</mark> were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin cancer each year.</P><P>In 1999, the District of Columbia Circuit Court took up Dudley’s smog argument. Evaluating the E.P.A. rule, the court found that the E.P.A. had “explicitly disregarded” the “possible health benefits of ozone.” In another part of the opinion, the court ruled, 2-1, that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the Constitutional Accountability Center, a think tank, revealed, the judges in the majority had previously attended legal junkets, on a Montana ranch, that were arranged by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment—a group funded by Koch family foundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their attendance.</P></DIV><DIV class=""SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7""><P>“Ideas don’t happen on their own,” Matt Kibbe, the president of FreedomWorks, a Tea Party advocacy group, told me. “Throughout history, ideas need patrons.” The Koch brothers, after helping to create Cato and Mercatus, concluded that think tanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver those ideas to the street, and to attract the public’s support. In 1984, David Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization, and Kibbe joined them. The group, Citizens for a Sound Economy, seemed like a grassroots movement, but according to the Center for Public Integrity it was sponsored principally by the Kochs, who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 1993. Its mission, Kibbe said, “was to take these heavy ideas and translate them for mass America. . . . We read the same literature Obama did about nonviolent revolutions—Saul Alinsky, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an example of nonviolent social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to sell ideas, not candidates.” Within a few years, the group had mobilized fifty paid field workers, in twenty-six states, to rally voters behind the Kochs’ agenda. David and Charles, according to one participant, were “very controlling, very top down. You can’t build an organization with them. <EM>They</EM> run it.”</P><P>Around this time, the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989, the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigated their business and released a scathing report accusing Koch Oil of “a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oil from Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring.” The Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-one million dollars’ worth of crude oil, but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators that oil measurement is “a very uncertain art.”</P><P>To defend its reputation, Koch Industries hired Robert Strauss, then a premier Washington lobbyist; the company soon opened an office in the city. A grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations, but it eventually disbanded, without issuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report, after the committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personal lives of committee staffers, even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the Kochs’ tactics. Kenneth Ballen, the counsel to the Senate committee, said, “These people have amassed such unaccountable power!”</P><P>By 1993, when Bill Clinton became President, Citizens for a Sound Economy had become a prototype for the kind of corporate-backed opposition campaigns that have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault on Clinton’s proposed B.T.U. tax on energy, for instance, running advertisements, staging media events, and targeting opponents. And it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitol—rallies that NPR described as “designed to strike fear into the hearts of wavering Democrats.” Dan Glickman, a former Democratic congressman from Wichita, who supported the B.T.U. tax, recalled, “I’d been in Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent. They used a lot of resources and effort—their employees, too.” Glickman suffered a surprise defeat. “I can’t prove it, but I think I was probably their victim,” he said.</P><P>The Kochs continued to disperse their money, creating slippery organizations with generic-sounding names, and this made it difficult to ascertain the extent of their influence in Washington. In 1990, Citizens for a Sound Economy created a spinoff group, Citizens for the Environment, which called acid rain and other environmental problems “myths.” When the Pittsburgh <EM>Post-Gazette</EM> investigated the matter, it discovered that the spinoff group had “no citizen membership of its own.”</P><P>In 1997, another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report called “an audacious plan to pour millions of dollars in contributions into Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source,” in order to evade campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, had paid more than three million dollars for attack ads in twenty-six House races and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an obscure nonprofit group, the Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee’s minority report suggested that “the trust was financed in whole or in part by Charles and David Koch of Wichita, Kansas.” The brothers were suspected of having secretly paid for the attack ads, most of which aired in states where Koch Industries did business. In Kansas, where Triad Management was especially active, the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races. The Kochs, when asked by reporters if they had given the money, refused to comment. In 1998, however, the <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM> confirmed that a consultant on the Kochs’ payroll had been involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis, of the Center for Public Integrity, described the scandal as “historic. Triad was the first time a major corporation used a cutout”—a front operation—“in a threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child of a company run amok.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7""><P>During the Clinton Administration, the energy industry faced increased scrutiny and regulation. In the mid-nineties, the Justice Department filed two lawsuits against Koch Industries, claiming that it was responsible for more than three hundred oil spills, which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as two hundred and fourteen million dollars_._ In a settlement, Koch Industries paid a record thirty-million-dollar civil fine, and agreed to spend five million dollars on environmental projects.</P><P>In 1999, a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosion that resulted from a leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, the company paid an undisclosed settlement.) And in the final months of the Clinton Presidency the Justice Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company, for covering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene, a carcinogen, from its refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The company was liable for three hundred and fifty million dollars in fines, and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five years in prison. The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one criminal charge of covering up environmental violations, including the falsification of documents, and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann, a career prosecutor who, at the time, headed the environmental-crimes section at the Justice Department, described the suit as “one of the most significant cases ever brought under the Clean Air Act.” He added, “Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance, and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both.”</P><P>During the 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent some nine hundred thousand dollars to support the candidacies of George W. Bush and other Republicans. During the Bush years, Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies enjoyed remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, which Hillary Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offered enormous subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit hawks, but, according to a study by Media Matters, their companies have benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since 2000.</P><P>In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its weight behind Bush’s reëlection. The group’s Oregon branch had attempted to get Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot, in order to dilute Democratic support for John Kerry. Critics argued that it was illegal for a tax-exempt nonprofit organization to donate its services for partisan political purposes. (A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)</P><P>That year, internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the organization to split apart. David Koch and Fink started a new group, Americans for Prosperity, and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political veteran who had worked with Ralph Reed, the evangelical leader and Republican activist, co-founding Century Strategies, a campaign-consulting company that became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips’s online biography describes him as an expert in “grasstops” and “grassroots” political organizing. The Kochs’ choice of Phillips signalled an even greater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist, who is known for praising “throat slitters” in politics, called Phillips “a grownup who can make things happen.”</P><P>Last year, Phillips told the <EM>Financial Times</EM> that Americans for Prosperity had only eight thousand registered members. Currently, its Web site claims that the group has “1.2 million activists.” Whatever its size, the Kochs’ political involvement has been intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me that Americans for Prosperity “was micromanaged by the Kochs.” And the brothers’ investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity, in concert with the family’s other organizations, has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama Presidency.</P><P>In January, 2008, Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America could be on the verge of “the greatest loss of liberty and prosperity since the 1930s.” That October, Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative operatives at a Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson, the editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com, took the lectern, thanked David Koch, and vowed to “unite and fight . . . the armies of the left!” Soon after Obama assumed office, Americans for Prosperity launched “Porkulus” rallies against Obama’s stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released a report claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually, the author was forced to correct the report, but not before Rush Limbaugh, citing the paper, had labelled Obama’s program “a slush fund,” and Fox News and other conservative outlets had echoed the sentiment. (Phil Kerpen, the vice-president for policy at Americans for Prosperity, is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at Americans for Prosperity, Walter Williams, often guest-hosts for Limbaugh.)</P><P>Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot, Patients United Now, which organized what Phillips has estimated to be more than three hundred rallies against health-care reform. At one rally, an effigy of a Democratic congressman was hung; at another, protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from Dachau. The group also helped organize the “Kill the Bill” protests outside the Capitol, in March, where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged that they were spat on and cursed at. Phillips was a featured speaker.</P><P>Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation, which is aimed at making industries pay for the air <mark>pollution</mark> that they create. Speakers for the group claimed, with exaggeration, that even back-yard barbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also involved in the attacks on Obama’s “green jobs” czar, Van Jones, and waged a crusade against international <mark>climate</mark> talks. Casting his group as a champion of ordinary workers who would be hurt by environmentalists, Phillips went to Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conference on <mark>climate change</mark>, declaring, “We’re a grassroots organization. . . . I think it’s unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthy families . . . want to send unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent.”</P><P>Grover Norquist, who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in Washington, including representatives from Americans for Prosperity, told me that last summer’s raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama’s agenda. The Republican leadership in Congress, he said, “couldn’t have done it without August, when people went out on the streets. It discouraged deal-makers”—Republicans who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover, the appearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K Street. “K Street is a three-billion-dollar weathervane,” Norquist said. “When Obama was strong, the Chamber of Commerce said, ‘We can work with the Obama Administration.’ But that changed when thousands of people went into the street and ‘terrorized’ congressmen. August is what changed it. Now that Obama is weak, people are getting tough.”</P><DIV class=""Callout__inset-left___2rZjf"" data-type=""callout"" data-callout=""inset-left""><DIV class=""CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM ""><A class=""Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW "" href=""https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a15097""><FIGURE class=""Figure__figure___U_9Te  ""><FIGCAPTION class=""ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5""><SPAN class=""ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO"">“I like looking at amateur porn, because I like seeing other people’s apartments.”</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></A></DIV></DIV><P>As the first anniversary of Obama’s election approached, David Koch came to the Washington area to attend a triumphant Americans for Prosperity gathering. Obama’s poll numbers were falling fast. Not a single Republican senator was working with the Administration on health care, or much else. Pundits were writing about Obama’s political ineptitude, and Tea Party groups were accusing the President of initiating “a government takeover.” In a speech, Koch said, “Days like today bring to reality the vision of our board of directors when we started this organization, five years ago.” He went on, “We envisioned a mass movement, a state-based one, but national in scope, of hundreds of thousands of American citizens from all walks of life standing up and fighting for the economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history. . . . Thankfully, the stirrings from California to Virginia, and from Texas to Michigan, show that more and more of our fellow-citizens are beginning to see the same truths as we do.”</P><P>While Koch didn’t explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day, more recently he has come close to doing so, praising it for demonstrating the “powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in government power, the massive efforts to socialize this country.” Charles Koch, in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees, compared the Obama Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chávez. The Kochs’ sense of imperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties, and since the seventies the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than those of the middle class. Yet the brothers’ message has evidently resonated with voters: a recent poll found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.</P><P>Americans for Prosperity, meanwhile, has announced that it will spend an additional forty-five million dollars before the midterm elections, in November. Although the group is legally prohibited from directly endorsing candidates, it nonetheless plans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate races, staging rallies, organizing door-to-door canvassing, and running ads aimed at “educating voters about where candidates stand.”</P><P>Though the Kochs have slowed Obama’s momentum, their larger political battle is far from won. Richard Fink, interviewed by FrumForum.com this spring, said, “If you look at where we’ve gone from the year 2000 to now, with the expansion of government spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country, it doesn’t look very good at all.” He went on, “It looks like the infrastructure that was built and nurtured has not carried the day.” He suggested that the Kochs needed “to get more into the practical, day-to-day issues of governing.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7""><P>In 1991, David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash in Los Angeles. He was the sole passenger in first class to survive. As he was recovering, a routine physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment, settled down, started a family, and reconsidered his life. As he told <EM>Portfolio,</EM> “When you’re the only one who survived in the front of the plane and everyone else died—yeah, you think, ‘My God, the good Lord spared me for some greater purpose.’ My joke is that I’ve been busy ever since, doing all the good work I can think of, so He can have confidence in me.”</P><P>Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he became a patron of cancer research, focussing on prostate cancer. In addition to his gifts to Sloan-Kettering, he gave fifteen million dollars to New York-Presbyterian Hospital, a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for cancer research, twenty million to Johns Hopkins University, and twenty-five million to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston. In response to his generosity, Sloan-Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership Award. In 2004, President Bush named him to the National Cancer Advisory Board, which guides the National Cancer Institute.</P><P>Koch’s corporate and political roles, however, may pose conflicts of interest. For example, at the same time that David Koch has been casting himself as a champion in the fight against cancer, Koch Industries has been lobbying to prevent the E.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde, which the company produces in great quantities, as a “known carcinogen” in humans.</P><P>Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats, and several major scientific studies have concluded that formaldehyde causes cancer in human beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute, on whose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients for an average of forty years; subjects exposed to higher amounts of formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped lead an expert panel within the National Institutes of Health to conclude that formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen, and be strictly controlled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on formaldehyde for decades, however, and Koch Industries has been a large funder of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A., requiring it to defer new regulations until more studies are completed.</P><P>Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005, after it bought Georgia-Pacific, the paper and wood-products company, for twenty-one billion dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division, and uses it to produce various wood products, such as plywood and laminates. Its annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2 billion pounds. Last December, Traylor Champion, Georgia-Pacific’s vice-president of environmental affairs, sent a formal letter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote that the company “strongly disagrees” with the N.I.H. panel’s conclusion that formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not recuse himself from the National Cancer Advisory Board, or divest himself of company stock, while his company was directly lobbying the government to keep formaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of formaldehyde had not come up.)</P><P>James Huff, an associate director at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, a division of the N.I.H., told me that it was “disgusting” for Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: “It’s just not good for public health. Vested interests should not be on the board.” He went on, “Those boards are very important. They’re very influential as to whether N.C.I. goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in formaldehyde.”</P><P>Harold Varmus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, knows David Koch from Memorial Sloan-Kettering, which he used to run. He said that, at Sloan-Kettering, “a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests. The one thing we wouldn’t tolerate in our board members is tobacco.” When told of Koch Industries’ stance on formaldehyde, Varmus said that he was “surprised.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7""><P>The David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins, at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, is a multimedia exploration of the theory that mankind evolved in response to <mark>climate change</mark>. At the main entrance, viewers are confronted with a giant graph charting the Earth’s temperature over the past ten million years, which notes that it is far cooler now than it was ten thousand years ago. Overhead, the text reads, “<EM class=""small"">HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD</EM>.” The message, as amplified by the exhibit’s Web site, is that “key human adaptations evolved in response to environmental instability.” Only at the end of the exhibit, under the headline “<EM class=""small"">OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE</EM>,” is it noted that levels of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide are higher now than they have ever been, and that they are projected to increase dramatically in the next century. No cause is given for this development; no mention is made of any possible role played by fossil fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying text says, “During the period in which humans evolved, Earth’s temperature and the amount of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere fluctuated together.” An interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark> in the future. People may build “underground cities,” developing “short, compact bodies” or “curved spines,” so that “moving around in tight spaces will be no problem.”</P><P>Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company’s January newsletter to employees, for instance, argues that “fluctuations in the earth’s <mark>climate</mark> predate humanity,” and concludes, “Since we can’t control Mother Nature, let’s figure out how to get along with her changes.” Joseph Romm, a physicist who runs the Web site <mark>Climate</mark>Progress.org, is infuriated by the Smithsonian’s presentation. “The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern <mark>climate</mark> issue,” he said. “I think the Kochs wanted to be seen as some sort of high-minded company, associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country. But the truth is, the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters, who are underground funders of action to stop efforts to deal with this threat to humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line.”</P><P>Cristián Samper, the museum’s director, said that the exhibit is not about <mark>climate change</mark>, and described Koch as “one of the best donors we’ve had, in my tenure here, because he’s very interested in the content, but completely hands off.” He noted, “I don’t know all the details of his involvement in other issues.”</P><P>The Kochs have long depended on the public’s not knowing all the details about them. They have been content to operate what David Koch has called “the largest company that you’ve never heard of.” But with the growing prominence of the Tea Party, and with increased awareness of the Kochs’ ties to the movement, the brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. Recently, President Obama took aim at the Kochs’ political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser, in Austin, he warned supporters that the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in the Citizens United case—which struck down laws prohibiting direct corporate spending on campaigns—had made it even easier for big companies to hide behind “groups with harmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity.” Obama said, “They don’t have to say who, exactly, Americans for Prosperity are. You don’t know if it’s a foreign-controlled corporation”—or even, he added, “a big oil company.” ♦</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER class=""ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ""><DIV class=""ArticleContributors__bio___3XQjk""><DIV class=""ArticleContributors__contributorWrapper___1CrIJ""><UL class=""ArticleContributors__contributorBios___3_jrJ false""><LI><P class=""ArticleContributors__contributorBioText___3m1QB"">Jane Mayer has been a <EM>New Yorker</EM> staff writer since 1995.</P></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></MAIN></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Those changes in regional atmospheric conditions are frustrating efforts to address <mark>pollution</mark> through emission controls.</P><P>&quot;Emissions in China have been decreasing over the last four years, but the severe winter haze is not getting better,&quot; said <A href=""http://www.eas.gatech.edu/people/Yuhang_Wang"">Yuhang Wang</A>, a professor in Georgia Tech's <A href=""http://www.eas.gatech.edu"">School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</A>. &quot;Mostly, that's because of a very rapid change in the high polar regions where sea ice is decreasing and snowfall is increasing. This perturbation keeps cold air from getting into the eastern parts of China where it would flush out the air <mark>pollution</mark>.&quot;</P><P>Reported March 15 in the journal <EM>Science Advances</EM>, the research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation and Environmental Protection Agency. The paper presents a clear example of how large-scale perturbations caused by global <mark>climate change</mark> can have significant regional impacts, and is believed to be the first to link sea ice and snowfall levels to regional air <mark>pollution</mark>.</P><P>Haze problems in the East China Plains – which include the capital Beijing – first gained worldwide attention during the winter of 2013 when an instrument at the U.S. embassy recorded extremely high levels of PM 2.5 particles. The haze prompted the Chinese government to institute strict targets for reducing emissions from industry and other sources.</P><P>Though these emission controls appear to be working, the haze during December and January continues. So Wang and colleagues Yufei Zou, Yuzhong Zhang and Ja-Ho Koo wondered if other factors may be playing a role.</P><P>Long-term air quality measurements aren’t available in China, so the researchers had to piece together estimates based on visibility measures and satellite data. To analyze the historical records, they created a new <mark>Pollution</mark> Potential Index (PPI) that used air temperature gradient anomalies and surface wind speeds as a proxy for ventilation conditions over eastern China.</P><P>“Once we generated the PPI and combined it with the visibility data, it was obvious that January 2013 was well beyond anything that had ever been seen before going back at least three decades,” said Wang. “But in that month emissions had not changed, so we knew there had to be another factor.”</P><P>The East China Plains consist of interconnected basins surrounded by mountain ranges to the west and the ocean to the east, a mirror image of the polluted Southern California. <mark>Pollution</mark> generated by industry and vehicles can be removed effectively only by horizontal dispersion or by vertical mixing in winter, and when those processes fail to move out stagnant air, <mark>pollution</mark> builds up. It seemed likely that something was preventing the ventilation that would have kept the air cleaner.</P><P>The researchers next looked at <mark>climate</mark> features such as sea ice, snowfall, El Niños, and Pacific Oscillations. They conducted principal component and maximum covariance analyses and found correlations of stagnant air conditions over China to Arctic sea ice – which reached a record low in the fall of 2012 – and snowfall in the upper latitudes of Siberia, which had reached a record high earlier in the winter. They then used atmospheric model simulations to study how those factors change large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns and <mark>pollution</mark> ventilation over eastern China.</P><P>“The reductions in sea ice and increase in snowfall have the effect of damping the climatological pressure ridge structure over China,” Wang said. “That flattens the temperature and pressure gradients and moves the East Asian Winter Monsoon to the east, decreasing wind speeds and creating an atmospheric circulation that makes the air in China more stagnant.”</P><P>The results of the model were consistent with observations that Korea and Japan had been unusually cold that winter, while eastern China had been unusually warm – both suggesting that the cold center had moved. </P><P>The winter of 2017 saw the same factors, with low levels of Arctic sea ice in September 2016, high snowfall – and severe haze. Wang says those factors are likely to continue as the global <mark>climate change</mark> disrupts the normal structure of the atmosphere.</P><P>“Despite the efforts to reduce emissions, we think that haze will probably continue for the future,” he said. “This is partly <mark>climate</mark>-driven now, so it probably won’t get much better in the winter. Emissions are no longer the only driver of these conditions.”</P><P>Wang hopes to continue the study using new data from China’s air quality monitoring network. The impact of global <mark>climate change</mark>, he said, may be unique to China because of its geography and sensitivity to changes in atmospheric circulation structure. Though the problem is now manifested in air <mark>pollution</mark>, he said the results of the study should encourage the nation to continue addressing <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“The very rapid change in polar warming is really having a large impact on China,” he said. “That gives China an incentive to not only follow through on air pollutant emission reductions, and also to look at the potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our research shows that cutting greenhouse gases would help with the winter haze problem.”</P><P><EM>This work was supported by the National Science Foundation Atmospheric Chemistry Program and the U.S. EPA Science To Achieve Results (STAR) Program through grant RD-83520401.

Instrumental <mark>climate</mark> data only extend back to the mid-19th century, at best, which means that the anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> signals we are chasing are in most cases longer than the available <mark>climate</mark> records. A wealth of <mark>climate</mark> history can be extracted from geologic archives such as corals, deep-sea sediments, cave stalagmites, lake deposits, tree rings, and ice cores.  Recent advances in research techniques mean that paleo<mark>climate</mark> data have approached the resolution and fidelity of instrumental <mark>climate</mark> data. This is especially true in many remote regions of the world, where long, high-quality instrumental <mark>climate</mark> records are often lacking. Using meticulously calibrated <mark>climate</mark> “proxies”, paleoclimatologists construct centuries- to millennia-long timeseries of climatic histories. They use such records to quantify the range of natural <mark>climate</mark> variability, investigate the mechanisms of past global <mark>climate change</mark> events, and gauge the accuracy of computer simulations of past <mark>climate change</mark>s made under a variety of different <mark>climate</mark> forcings. The ultimate goal of paleo<mark>climate</mark> research is to help identify the strengths and weaknesses of global <mark>climate</mark> models – models that are charged with projecting the future impacts of anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>. Such projections (and their uncertainties) are arguably the most important input for cost-benefit analyses designed to critically assess the consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation and/or mitigation strategies. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD><TD class=""col2"" style=""border-width:0px; border-style:solid; ""><DIV class=""stacks_out"" style=""width: 100%;""><DIV class=""stacks_in"" style=""padding: 10px""><H3 class=""unify"">From the Blog:</H3>Atlanta, GA...continue reading on the blog

The study is scheduled for publication on February 23 in the journal <A href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/n<mark>climate</mark>2541""><EM>Nature <mark>Climate Change</mark></EM></A><EM>. </EM>The study was a collaboration with the Florida Institute of Technology, with Cobb’s lab providing an expertise in fossil coral analysis.</P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> is the leading cause of coral-reef degradation. The global coral reef landscape is now characterized by declining coral cover, reduced growth and calcification, and slowdowns in reef accretion. The new study provides data to assist scientists in understanding how changes in the environment trigger long-term changes in coral reef growth and ecosystem function, which is a critical challenge to coral-reef conservation.</P><P>“Temperature was a key cause of reef collapse and modern temperatures are now within several degrees of the maximum these reefs experienced over their 6,750 year history,” said Lauren Toth, the study’s lead author, who was a graduate student at Florida Tech during the study. “It's possible that anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> may once again be pushing these reefs towards another regional collapse.”</P><P>For the study, the research team analyzed a 6,750-year-old coral core from Pacific Panamá.The team then reconstructed the coral’s past functions, such as growth and accretion (accumulation of layers of coral), and compared that to surrounding environmental conditions before, during and after the 2,500-year hiatus in vertical accretion.</P><P>“We saw evidence for a different <mark>climate</mark> regime during that time period,” Cobb said. “The geochemical signals were consistent with a period that is very cool and very wet, with very strong upwelling, which is more like a modern day La Niña event in this part of the Pacific.”</P><P>In Pacific Panamá, La Niña-like periods are characterized by a cold, wet <mark>climate</mark> with strong seasonal upwelling. Due to limited data at the site, the researchers cannot quantify the intensity of La Niña events during this time, but document that conditions similar to La Niña were present at this site during this time.</P><P>“These conditions would have been for quite an extended time, which suggests that the reef was quite sensitive to prolonged change in environmental conditions,” Cobb said. “So sensitive, in fact, that it stopped accreting over that period.”</P><P>Future <mark>climate change</mark>, similar to the changes during the hiatus in coral growth, could cause coral reefs to behave similarly, the study authors suggest, leading to another shutdown in reef development in the tropical eastern Pacific.</P><P>“We are in the midst of a major environmental change that will continue to stress corals over the coming decades, so the lesson from this study is that there are these systems such as coral reefs that are sensitive to environmental change and can go through this kind of wholesale collapse in response to these environmental changes,” Cobb said.</P><P>Future work will involve expanding the study to include additional locations throughout the tropical Pacific.</P><P>“A broad-scale perspective on long-term reef growth and environmental variability would allow us to better characterize the environmental thresholds leading to reef collapse and the conditions that facilitate survival,” Toth said. “A better understanding of the controls on reef development in the past will allow us to make better predictions about which reefs may be most vulnerable to <mark>climate change</mark> in the future.&quot;</P><P><EM>This research is supported by a Graduate Student Research Grant from the Geological Society of America, the American Museum of Natural History’s Lerner-Gray Fund for Marine Research, and grants from the Smithsonian Institution’s Marine Science Network.

Then Cobb emerges with a victorious &quot;Yes!&quot;</P><P>A few minutes later, Cobb, a paleoclimatologist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, dives back to the bottom and, from under a coral head, extracts the prize: two small containers encrusted with coralline algae. Inside are recorders of salinity and temperature that captured in excruciating detail the 2015–16 El Niño event, which brought a pulse of abnormally warm water to the tropical Pacific. The recorders showed that during the disturbance, which wreaked climatic havoc around the globe, the warming here set a record: 3°C above normal. The extreme warmth, Cobb says, reflected not just the natural El Niño cycle, but a new factor: global warming caused by human activity.</P><P>As she will report next week at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco, California, a detailed, long-term temperature record derived from corals on Christmas and other Pacific islands shows that over the last 7000 years, El Niños waxed and waned. Then, during the 20th century, with global warming taking hold, their intensity began to climb. The trend is likely to continue, boding ever more destructive El Niños, she says. &quot;It's yet another impact of global warming that we'd like to avoid.&quot;</P><P>Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City, says Cobb's temperature archive offers the first historical picture of El Niño and its changes. &quot;It's unique and gives a fascinating window into an otherwise totally obscure, but vitally important, part of <mark>climate</mark> history.&quot;</P><P>El Niños arrive every 3 to 7 years when winds fail in the tropical Pacific, allowing warm water to pool in the eastern part of the ocean. The oceanic warmth disrupts fisheries and can bleach and kill corals—85% of Christmas Island's corals may have died in the latest El Niño, which ended in May. El Niños also trigger widespread floods and droughts that, during the extreme El Niño of 1997–98, caused $35 billion in damage and claimed an estimated 23,000 lives.</P><P>Yet no one knew whether the gradual warming of the globe is intensifying these events, in part because records are short and spotty in the remote parts of the Pacific where El Niño hits hardest. To get the long view, Cobb and her collaborators gathered hundreds of lumps of old coral washed up on beaches on Christmas and Fanning islands (both part of the Republic of Kiribati) and the U.S. island of Palmyra. By applying uranium-thorium dating to the corals and measuring ratios of oxygen isotopes in their skeletons, her lab reconstructed ocean temperatures for much of the last 7000 years.</P><P>During that time, Cobb says, &quot;all kinds of stuff was going on in the <mark>climate</mark>, but it had no discernible effect on El Niño events.&quot; But the corals, supplemented by sensors like the one Cobb recovered off Christmas, show that over the past century El Niño intensity has increased by 25%. &quot;There is no century even remotely resembling the 20th in the record for at least 5000 years,&quot; she says.</P><P>Cobb's finding is consistent with a 2013 study of tree rings suggesting that El Niño–related weather havoc has intensified across much of the globe in recent decades, notes Wenju Cai, a <mark>climate</mark> modeler at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Melbourne, Australia. But the tree ring record is too short, he says, to show whether global warming is to blame. Cobb's 7000-year archive, in contrast, &quot;clearly shows that 20th century El Niños are more extreme and intense than they were before the industrial era, and that points to global warming as a cause.&quot;</P><P>Eric Guilyardi, a <mark>climate</mark> scientist at the Pierre Simon Laplace Institute in Paris, hopes Cobb's results will inspire others to develop similar temperature records elsewhere in the equatorial Pacific. &quot;This will give us the spatial view needed to be sure El Niño is indeed changing.&quot;</P><P>Now, Cobb plans to push her temperature record into the future. &quot;We're now tracking 30 corals that have survived this latest El Niño,&quot; she says. They're waiting to record the next one—and even hotter seas to come.</P></DIV><FOOTER class=""article__foot""><DIV class=""meta-line"" style=""margin-bottom: .5em"">Posted in: </DIV></FOOTER></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

		 Bevan and Wibbels have documented eight different types of courtship and mating behavior among the turtles in the Gulf.

Among several toxic hot spots discovered there were five plots of soil with high levels of dioxin that Georgia-Pacific says were fly ash piles from 2001-2002, when the mill burned wood from Bay Area landfills to create power and sell it to Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. Redwood bark was sprayed with PCB oil so that it would burn in the power house. The result was the creation of the most toxic chemical known to science, large molecule dioxin. Not only is large molecule dioxin known to cause cancer and other serious conditions, it can damage living organisms, including humans, on the level of their DNA.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""large"">Since the mill closed, the city of Fort Bragg has been working with the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) to clean-up the dioxin-contaminated coastline. To date, thousands of truck loads of contaminated soil have been hauled off to a toxic waste dump 200 miles away. Other polluted acreage has been bio-remediated in place.  By the end of this year, the two halves of the Noyo headlands coastal trail that have been built on the former mill site, will finally be linked together, allowing Fort Bragg to leave behind its reputation as a coastal town without a coast.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""large"">The remediation process has been challenging, due to opposition from Georgia-Pacific and an active vocal community that has demanded a thorough clean-up every step of the way. Now, after 15 years of effort, the clean-up is reaching an end. There is however, one last piece that needs to be remediated: the Mill Pond. This pond was the recipient of a plethora of hazardous materials including transformers, batteries, and chemicals. Testing by DTSC shows unsafe levels of dioxins and PCBs, as well as other toxins in the pond. Community members are concerned because the pond is surrounded by a wetlands area and is within close proximity to the ocean. If a tsunami or earthquake should occur, the sludge in the pond could be released into coastal waters, contaminating marine life including species that are valuable to the fishing industry.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""large"">The citizens of Fort Bragg have been adamant that the city council and DTSC require the mill pond to be cleaned one hundred percent. The idea of having a coastal trail with a huge pond fenced off and signs reading “Danger: Hazardous Toxins. Stay Out,” is not acceptable to the community. A healthy community is one that adopts a standard of stewardship and takes responsibility to have a clean safe environment now and for future generations to come. Georgia-Pacific Corporation  believes the mill pond should be left as is, which has put pressure on the Fort Bragg City council. Despite the opposition from Georgia-Pacific, on November 27, 2017, with support from the community, council members voted in a landmark decision to adopt the following resolution regarding the mill pond:</SPAN></P><P style=""text-align:center;""><STRONG><SPAN class=""large"">RESOLUTION OF THE FORT BRAGG CITY COUNCIL</SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN class=""large""> FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CITIZENS OF THE NORTH COAST, THE ENVIRONMENT, AND OUR ECONOMIC FUTURE</SPAN></STRONG></P><P><SPAN class=""large""> </SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""large"">            <STRONG>WHEREAS,</STRONG> Fort Bragg, California is a beautiful coastal destination community that is focused upon health and well-being with a vision to develop a coastal trail on the former mill site that is bringing thousands of new people to our community; and</SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""large"">            <STRONG>WHEREAS,</STRONG> the long term well-being of our region is entirely dependent upon a healthy ocean and natural landscape, requiring protection of our unique Fort Bragg coastal resources and offering unique opportunities through restoration of the coastal wetlands; and</SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""large"">            <STRONG>WHEREAS,</STRONG> the final phase of the mill site cleanup is underway, and the mill pond and associated wetlands contain toxic contamination that may be harmful to the health and well-being of humans and wildlife both on the land and in the ocean; and</SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""large"">            <STRONG>WHEREAS,</STRONG> plans for wetlands restoration has been part of the community planning in conjunction with cleanup decision making process because monies to achieve the best restoration for the former mill site are more available while this process is underway, working collaboratively with the City of Fort Bragg for the best outcome on the Headlands; and</SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""large"">            <STRONG>WHEREAS,</STRONG> the mill pond is vulnerable to earthquake, tsunami and sea level rise and is in the historic pathway of Maple Creek, and the restoration effort; and</SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""large"">            <STRONG>WHEREAS,</STRONG> the need for <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation in every coastal community is real and urgent; and</SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""large"">           <STRONG> NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED</STRONG> that the City Council of the City of Fort Bragg does hereby resolve that:   <U>          </U></SPAN></P><OL><LI><SPAN class=""large"">The restoration of all the wetland areas on the mill site be given a strong and renewed priority by decision-makers; and</SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN class=""large"">The community would like to see the mill pond dismantled and thoroughly cleaned of toxic contamination or safely and permanently capped with meadowland; and</SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN class=""large"">Plans for a more natural wetlands system restoration become the priority, and include planning for lowland tidal marshes, possibly upland marshes, and the daylighting of Maple and Alder Creeks; and</SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN class=""large"">Every effort to implement a sound environmental solution to the remediation will be pursued in a timely fashion.</SPAN></LI></OL><P><SPAN class=""large"">This resolution is extremely important because it speaks to the wellness of the community at large, from both environmental and social perspectives.

EPA scientists had set to work on the tool, called the <mark>Climate</mark> Resilience Screening Index, under the previous administration. By ranking regions, states, and counties across the U.S., they hoped to reveal which areas need to boost their resilience most urgently—and to prompt local and national governments to act accordingly.</P><P>Still, the EPA resilience report isn't just about extreme weather events, but also about how factors like inequality, ethnicity, and infrastructure affect a community's ability to deal with and recover from such events when they do occur.</P><P>Assessing that ability requires looking beyond data sets about the Earth's atmosphere and geophysics, and focusing as well on indicators not typically included in discussions of <mark>climate change</mark>.

Calculating risks means asking questions about the chances of flooding in a given area, and whether houses there are built in the floodplain. But that's just the beginning of the story.</P><P>To calculate the four other characteristics, the researchers also measured factors like age, education, homelessness, language, and health. They examined metrics such as the number of participants in the <A href=""https://www.fema.gov/national-flood-insurance-program"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">National Flood Insurance Program</A>, whether there is a healthy local construction industry to rebuild following a disaster, and whether neighbors are more inclined to help one another, or to retreat into ethnically isolated enclaves.</P><P>They also measured the urban fabric: things like the number of vacant structures, the availability of Internet and radio to aid communication in the wake of a disaster, and whether there are sufficient roads, railways, and airports nearby to assist in evacuation. Indicators such as biodiversity, air quality, and forest condition were used to assess the quality of the natural environment.</P><P>Kodiak Island is lucky. Its resilience is largely a function of its abundant and pristine natural environment, and of the minimal risk from <mark>climate</mark>-induced events.</P><P>Most other counties in the U.S. don't have the same natural advantages. Some of the communities on course to suffer most are the ones already struggling thanks to poverty, inequality, and other challenges.</P><P>The state of Georgia, for instance, is no more at risk from <mark>climate</mark> impacts than the average state, but is nonetheless acutely vulnerable to <mark>climate</mark>-related events, thanks to less-stringent building codes, a high number of vacant structures, and old public infrastructure.</P><P>But it is Metcalfe County, in Kentucky, that earns the dubious honor of being the least resilient county in the entire U.S., despite its relatively low risk from <mark>climate</mark> events. That's because Metcalfe County scores low on factors that include social cohesion, security, and its built environment. It happens to sit within EPA <A href=""https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-epa-region-4-southeast"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">region four</A>, which is the least resilient region in the U.S. This southeastern group of states also encompasses Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and six indigenous tribes.</P><P>The index further illustrates how the counties that suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Harvey were already poised to fail as soon as disaster struck, thanks to poor security, infrastructure, a high proportion of empty buildings, and low skills diversity.</P><P>It may seem surprising that the EPA, currently under the direction of an administrator who has questioned whether <mark>climate change</mark> is necessarily a &quot;<A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/02/07/scott-pruitt-asks-if-global-warming-necessarily-is-a-bad-thing/?utm_term=.7f9447cadd76"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">bad thing</A>,&quot; has released a report spelling out the consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> for almost every community in the U.S. But it's worth noting that, in November, the White House also <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-06/how-the-trump-white-house-wound-up-releasing-dire-<mark>climate</mark>-report"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">permitted</A> the release of the National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment, which stated that the threat of <mark>climate change</mark> was both serious and man-made. It's also pertinent that the CRSI results are not based on long-term <mark>climate</mark> projections, but upon events that have actually occurred over the last 16 years, or which are likely to happen in the next 10. In other words, these are based not on distant projections, but on events recorded in newspapers and on television. That makes the findings more difficult to deny.</P><P>The real question is how the EPA plans to use such a granular breakdown. It is one thing to release a report on <mark>climate change</mark>, and quite another to act on it.</P><P>The report's authors make their own suggestions, including identifying problem areas that could stand to learn from more resilient counties. The report can also help investors and non-profits determine where investments might provide the greatest return, and could serve as evidence for counties to pursue additional state or federal funding.</P><P>An EPA spokesperson says that the agency is working with its 10 regional offices to identify opportunities to put the index into action, but seems reluctant to acknowledge that such moves would amount to making plans to deal with <mark>climate change</mark>. Asked whether the administration's skepticism about <mark>climate change</mark> would affect its plans for the index, the spokesperson simply says: &quot;This index addresses acute meteorological events.&quot;</P><P>Even if such a handbook only ends up gathering dust in D.C. offices, it could still be a powerful tool in the hands of regional governments and non-governmental organizations. From California's <mark>carbon</mark> market to the <A href=""https://www.wearestillin.com/us-action-<mark>climate</mark>-change-irreversible"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">We Are Still In</A> coalition, it is states, cities, tribes, and counties that have assumed responsibility for driving the U.S. toward a greener future in the absence of federal action.</P><P>&quot;Whatever happens, I definitely think the CRSI is something innovative. I haven't seen much else like it,&quot; says James DeWeese, a research analyst working on <mark>climate</mark> resilience at the <A href=""http://www.wri.org/"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">World Resources Institute</A>, who was not involved in the report.</P><P>The tool, as it stands, is still not perfect. Even with 117 metrics, it is difficult to capture the nuances and challenges of resilience in a country as large and diverse as the U.S. But it's a work in progress; the authors are still honing their methods and the ranking system, and recently released a version of the index adapted to <A href=""https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?dirEntryId=339738"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">coastal counties</A> in EPA region four to improve the accuracy of these areas.</P><P>The U.S. needs to reduce its emissions and adapt to the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>. But to really thrive in a future of <mark>climate change</mark>, the nation will need more than solar energy and sea walls. The EPA’s new index shows that the most resilient areas are also those with the healthiest societies, the wildest nature, and the most diverse economies. Increasing resilience means addressing all these dimensions of the problem. That task might be huge, but then so are the benefits.</P><P><EM><A href=""https://psmag.com/environment/new-landscapes"">New Landscapes</A> is a regular series investigating how environmental policies are affecting communities across America.</EM></P></DIV><FOOTER class=""m-detail--footer""><DIV class=""m-detail--meta""><DL><DT class=""m-detail--label"">Tags</DT></DL></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

</SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class=""article__body""><P>The Northeast Pacific’s largest marine heatwave on record was at least in part caused by El Niño <mark>climate</mark> patterns. And unusually warm water events in that ocean could potentially become more frequent with rising levels of greenhouse gases.</P><P>That’s the findings of a new study by researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They linked the 2014-2015 marine heatwave – often referred to as the “warm blob” –  to weather patterns that started in late 2013. The heatwave caused marine animals to stray far outside of their normal habitats, disrupting ecosystems and leading to massive die-offs of seabirds, whales and sea lions.</P><P>The study, which was published July 11 in journal <EM>Nature <mark>Climate Change</mark></EM>, was sponsored by the National Science Foundation.</P><P>“We had two and a half years of consistent warming, which translated to a record harmful algal bloom in 2015 and prolonged stress on the ecosystem,” said Emanuele Di Lorenzo, a professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. “What we do in the study is ask whether this type of activity is going to become more frequent with greenhouse gases rising.”</P><P>The researchers traced the origin of the marine heat wave to a few months during late 2013 and early 2014, when a ridge of high pressure led to much weaker winds that normally bring cold Artic air over the North Pacific. That allowed ocean temperatures to rise a few degrees above average.</P><P>Then, in mid-2014 the tropical weather pattern El Niño intensified the warming throughout the Pacific. The warm temperatures lingered through the end of the year, and by 2015 the region of warm water had expanded to the West Coast, where algal blooms closed fisheries for clams and Dungeness crab.</P><P>“The bottom line is that El Niño had a hand in this even though we’re talking about very long-distance influences,” said Nate Mantua, a research scientist at NOAA Fisheries’ Southwest Fisheries Science Center and a coauthor of the study.</P><P>The researchers used <mark>climate</mark> model simulations to show the connection between increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and the impact on the ocean water temperatures. The study found that these extreme weather events could become more frequent and pronounced as the <mark>climate</mark> warms.</P><P>“This multi-year event caused extensive impacts on marine life,” Di Lorenzo said. “For example, some salmon populations have life cycles of three years, so the marine heatwave  has brought a poor feeding, growth and survival environment in the ocean for multiple generations. Events like this contribute to reducing species diversity.”</P><P>And the effects of the “warm blob” could linger.</P><P>“Some of these effects are still ongoing and not fully understood because of the prolonged character of the ocean heatwave,” Di Lorenzo said. “Whether these multi-year <mark>climate</mark> extremes will become more frequent under greenhouse forcing is a key question for scientists, resource managers and society.”</P><P><EM>This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. OCE 1356924 and OCE 1419292.

On that day, October 17, 30 Pacific <mark>Climate</mark> Warriors from 12 different nations paddled out in hand carved traditional canoes, followed by hundreds of Australians in kayaks to confront the gigantic coal ships that pass through the channel. They were met head on not only by the ships, but also by an aggressive police force on the water who were determined to let the coal ships through.</P><P>The scenes that followed were intense, dramatic and moving -- this short video captures some of that drama, as does <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/350org/sets/72157648810280615/"" target=""_hplink"">this Flickr photostream</A>. </P><P><A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://vimeo.com/109360466"">Canoes Vs. Coal</A> from <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://vimeo.com/peteryacono"">Peter Yacono</A> on <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://vimeo.com"">Vimeo</A>.</P><P>The canoe blockade of Newcastle was not the end of the Warrior's campaign in Australia. In the week that followed, the Pacific <mark>Climate</mark> Warriors joined with Australians around the country in five peaceful occupations of fossil fuel companies and those financing fossil fuels. This included an occupation by 80 people in Melbourne of the global headquarters of ANZ -- Australia's biggest funder of fossil fuels. This video captures what was quite a remarkable occupation.</P><P><A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://vimeo.com/109754412"">Stand Up For The Pacific</A> from <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://vimeo.com/user21187358"">Georgia Sampson</A> on <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://vimeo.com"">Vimeo</A>.</P><P>But those images and videos only hint at the lasting impact of the Pacific <mark>Climate</mark> Warriors. The impact has been deep, and is already reshaping what happens next. Here's four ways the Pacific <mark>Climate</mark> Warriors changed the landscape of the future:</P><P><STRONG>1. The story of the Pacific Islands and <mark>climate change</mark> is no longer just about drowning and loss. It's about the fight to keep the Islands above water, and fossil fuels in the ground.</STRONG></P><P>For the Pacific <mark>Climate</mark> Warriors, this battle was a move to shift attention away from the sense of inevitable loss to be wreaked upon Pacific Islands by <mark>climate change</mark>, to directly challenging and halting the very activities that are causing <mark>climate change</mark>. That meant calling out the fossil fuel industry, the Australian Government and those opposing action on <mark>climate change</mark>. It also meant taking action that would directly impact the opposition as a means of fighting back against the damage they are causing. It was a truly David versus Goliath fight -- those small traditional canoes and dozens of kayaks up against the might of the gigantic coal ships.</P><P>The odds of success at keeping the Islands above water remains an outside chance. But prior to the Warrior blockade of Newcastle Port, there was no genuine fight for the Islands beyond what Pacific prime ministers and presidents could do through formal governmental channels. There is now a fight on for the Islands, and that story will deepen in the approaching months as the Warriors now plan for where, when and how they will strike next.</P><P><STRONG>2. Rekindling old traditions to take bold action</STRONG>
In many Islands, the ancient tradition of building canoes has been gradually diminishing over decades. The reinvigorated those traditions, bringing together young people to learn from elders the skills of canoe building. For the community in Tokelau, it was the first time in 80 years that a canoe had been built in the old way -- from the tree to the months of carving and rope weaving. </P><P>The canoes carried the spirit of the people, and throughout the blockade that spirit showed. The canoe from Vanuatu named &quot;Ta Reo Vanuatu&quot;, meaning &quot;The Voice of Vanuatu&quot; carried the blessing of their Government, as well as of local villages. On the day, when Ta Reo Vanuatu had its outrigger smashed off by a police boat repeatedly ramming it, the capsized canoe was brought back to shore, tears were shared, prayers said and the team got to work to reattach the outrigger. Within 30 minutes it was out paddling again. </P><P>The spirit of the canoes and the warriors kept things calm, right when things were on the cusp of turning, with the police looking to escalate the situation. By the afternoon, riot police trucks had been parked up around the corner. But rather than get angry, the Warriors used their strength of spirit and faith to steer the day away from police escalation to continued peaceful action. Everyone else followed their lead.</P><P>Never before has the Pacific engaged in such a bold and unified act of nonviolent direct action, but they showed they are natural leaders at it.</P><P><STRONG>3. A movement that has only just seen the beginning of its power</STRONG></P><P>The Pacific <mark>Climate</mark> Warriors didn't just rise out of nowhere. Their rise is rooted in a grassroots network, <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://350pacific.org"" target=""_hplink"">350 Pacific</A>, with organizers in 16 Pacific Islands; and beyond that their rise is rooted in their strength of faith, humility and deep connection to the land, ocean and ancestors.</P><P>As the 350 Pacific network has developed in the last five years, the priority has been to take the lead from young indigenous peoples at the grassroots, using the strength of culture and faith to stand up for the Pacific. That's lead to the formation of local country groups like 350 Tonga, 350 Solomon Islands, and 350 Vanuatu. These are not groups dictated by the constraints of a global parent organization, but are owned and shaped locally. </P><P>Here's the board and team of 350 Vanuatu.</P><P>By mobilizing the 350 Pacific network to Australia in bold action, we saw the incredible strength and diversity of the warrior tradition in the Pacific. That warrior tradition is one that will continue to rise as the fight to keep the islands above water heats up. </P><P><STRONG>4. A new strategy to keep the Islands above water</STRONG>
Until this blockade, the strategy to keep the islands above water was confined to the limits of what Pacific governments and big non-government organizations could do. Most Pacific Island leaders have shown tremendous leadership on <mark>climate change</mark>, but their effort needs to be coupled with that of a grassroots movement that can do what they can't -- like blockade coal ships in other countries. </P><P>Understanding what it will take to keep the Islands above water is confronting -- it requires keeping 70-80 percent of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground. To have any chance of facing up to that challenge, the response has to be necessarily confronting. Thus as the Pacific <mark>Climate</mark> Warriors have returned home, we are already planning for the redeployment of the Pacific <mark>Climate</mark> Warriors, and the next peaceful battle in the fight to keep the Islands above water.</P><P>You can keep track of the rise of the Pacific <mark>Climate</mark> Warriors by following 350 Pacific on <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/350Pacific"" target=""_hplink"">Facebook</A> and <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://twitter.com/350pacific"" target=""_hplink"">Twitter</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Read on for further examples and tactics.</A></DIV><P>From the turn of the century through the 1970s, asbestos was inescapable. The so-called “<A href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1968/10/12/the-magic-mineral"">magic mineral</A>” was in fireproof theater curtains, gas masks, prison-cell padding, brake linings, and thousands of other products.</P><P>One such product—a version of the construction material known as joint compound, sold under the name Ready-Mix—contained asbestos from 1965 to 1977 and proved to be a major problem for its manufacturer Georgia-Pacific, a conglomerate now owned by Koch Industries that specializes in wood and paper products. As the dangers from asbestos became publicly known, Georgia-Pacific, like many other companies that had made asbestos-containing products, became swamped with a deluge of legal claims from people who had contracted lung disease from exposure to the company’s product.</P><P>Rather than face those claims honestly, beginning in 2005, Georgia-Pacific crafted and published <EM>counterfeit science</EM>—seeding the literature with articles intended to raise doubts about the dangers posed by asbestos. In so doing, the company created a life-threatening hazard by deceiving those who rely on science to understand the health risks of asbestos exposure.</P><P>Asbestos—which is not a single mineral at all, but rather a collective name for six fibrous minerals—has been shown by many scientific studies to be extremely dangerous to human health. <A href=""https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/asbestos/asbestos-fact-sheet"">Both</A> domestic and international government agencies now classify it as a known human carcinogen, <A href=""https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/asbestos/health_effects_asbestos.html"">linked to</A> asbestosis, mesothelioma, and other lung cancers. Since the 1970s, its use has been <A href=""https://www.epa.gov/asbestos/asbestos-laws-and-regulations"">heavily regulated</A>, although it is <A href=""https://www.epa.gov/asbestos/us-federal-bans-asbestos"">not banned in the US</A>.</P><P>In 1977, as the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) moved to ban asbestos-containing joint compound, Georgia-Pacific’s chairman <A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/802623-1977-georgia-pacific-letter-to-cpsc.html"">even wrote</A> to CPSC that “We support a total ban on spackling compound containing asbestos,” as Georgia-Pacific had already “ceased using asbestos in our product and switched to a substitute.” Despite that public statement, however, the company privately worried about its liability for having sold the asbestos-containing product for many years.</P><P>By 2002, concern about asbestos-related legal claims had severely damaged Georgia-Pacific’s stock. An unflattering three-part series in the <EM>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</EM> that year revealed that Georgia-Pacific was aware of the science showing the dangers of asbestos for several years before the company put a warning label on Ready-Mix. The newspaper series caused Georgia-Pacific’s chairman to pen an op-ed in the same paper, claiming that “throughout the years we’ve dealt with the legal consequences of asbestos fibers, we have worked diligently and in good faith to resolve a staggering 250,000 individual legal claims,” and that “we have consistently acted responsibly—for victims, our employees and shareholders.”</P><P>Even if the company did act as it claimed up to 2002, by 2005—under the guidance of the same chairman—Georgia-Pacific had turned to counterfeit science to fend off lawsuits. That year, the company created a so-called research program—run through its legal department—that knowingly produced flawed science and published it in independent scientific journals while failing to adequately disclose the authors’ conflicts of interest.</P><P>Documents later obtained by the Center for Public Integrity <A href=""https://www.publicintegrity.org/2013/10/21/13559/facing-lawsuits-over-deadly-asbestos-paper-giant-launched-secretive-research"">revealed that</A> Georgia-Pacific put its research strategy into action by hiring its head of toxicology, Stewart Holm, for a “separate and distinct” role as a so-called “litigation consultant.” Routing Holm’s new work through the legal department allowed the company to claim attorney-client privilege over all documents related to his counterfeit science work, thereby keeping it from the public—a tactic <A href=""http://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/sites/default/files/resources/doj-final-opinion.pdf"">pioneered by the tobacco industry</A> when it conducted counterfeit research to confuse the public about the dangers of cigarettes.</P><P>With the counterfeit science program tucked away in its legal department, Georgia-Pacific published 13 scientific articles that were deeply flawed, both in methodology—for instance, opting for a five-day study rather than the preferred two-year study to test whether chronic inhalation of fibers can cause cancers, fibrosis, or mesothelioma—and by not adequately revealing the authors’ clear conflicts of interest. None of the papers published through this scheme, for example, disclosed that Georgia-Pacific’s legal team had been overseeing almost every aspect of the research.</P><P>A multi-year legal battle over internal documents about Georgia-Pacific’s research program culminated in a <A href=""http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/3dseries/2013/2013_04127.htm"">unanimous ruling</A> against the company in June 2013. A New York state appeals court affirmed a trial court’s ruling that the company must turn over the documents so that the court could determine whether Georgia-Pacific’s actions over the research program were in furtherance of fraud and therefore not covered by attorney-client privilege. The court found ample evidence that Georgia-Pacific’s actions could have been in furtherance of fraud, including the company’s failure to disclose that its in-house lawyer had reviewed the manuscripts before submission, or that Holm had been concurrently employed with the company for asbestos litigation purposes.</P><H3><STRONG>Why It Matters</STRONG></H3><P>As this case shows, intentionally publishing counterfeit science endangers public health. People rely on scientific literature to understand the hazards they face at work, at home, and anywhere else. When companies create and publish knowingly flawed science, or even when they fail to disclose important (and in most cases, required) conflicts of interest to journals, the public pays the price. Sometimes, as in this case, matters of life and death are at stake.</P><P>Asbestos is especially notable because of how dangerous it is to human health. As noted by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, “Breathing asbestos fibers can cause a buildup of scar-like tissue in the lungs called asbestosis and result in loss of lung function that often progresses to disability and death. Asbestos also causes cancer of the lung and other diseases such as mesothelioma of the pleura which is a fatal malignant tumor of the membrane lining the cavity of the lung or stomach.” <A href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/04/11/523277735/asbestos-deaths-remain-a-public-health-concern-cdc-finds"">Thousands of Americans</A> die every year because of asbestos exposure.</P><P>Counterfeit science about asbestos is also particularly damaging because it took many years for the public to fully recognize the dangers of asbestos that scientists were uncovering. Documents released in lawsuits in the 1970s show that major manufacturers knew about the dangers of <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1978/11/12/new-data-on-asbestos-indicate-cover-up-of-effects-on-workers/028209a4-fac9-4e8b-a24c-50a93985a35d/"">asbestos as early as the 1930s</A>, but ignored, buried, or silenced scientists and science that could have publicly brought forth the information to the public. Indeed, it took until 1964 for research about the dangers of asbestos to make waves publicly, forcing companies to change their ways and the government to regulate asbestos. And the author of that pioneering science published in 1964—Dr. Irving Selikoff—faced scrutiny and harassment from the asbestos industry.</P><P>The question remains: how much safer would the public be if industry had listened to the science in the first place, and if unscrupulous companies such as Georgia-Pacific had not devoted years and resources to undermining the scientific understanding of asbestos with counterfeit science?</P><H3><STRONG>Further Reading</STRONG></H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Recent salmon abundance in the northern North Pacific Ocean, as indexed by commercial catches, has been among the highest on record, with no indication of decline; the 2009 catch was the highest to date. Although the North Pacific Ocean continues to produce large quantities of Pacific salmon, temporal abundance patterns vary among species and areas. Currently, pink and chum salmon are very abundant overall and Chinook and coho salmon are less abundant than they were previously, whereas sockeye salmon abundance varies among areas. Analyses confirm <mark>climate</mark>-related shifts in abundance, associated with reported ecosystem regime shifts in approximately 1947, 1977, and 1989. We found little evidence to support a major shift after 1989. From 1990, generally favourable <mark>climate</mark>-related marine conditions in the western North Pacific Ocean, as well as expanding hatchery operations and improving hatchery technologies, are increasing abundances of chum and pink salmon. In the eastern North Pacific Ocean, <mark>climate</mark>-related changes are apparently playing a role in increasing chum and pink salmon abundances and declining numbers of coho and Chinook salmon.</SECTION><H2 scrollto-destination=""12258434"" id=""12258434"" class=""section-title"" data-legacy-id=""s1"">Introduction</H2><P>Pacific salmon (genus <EM>Oncorhynchus</EM>) are an important ecological and economic species complex in the North Pacific Ocean. Their natural distribution extends from San Francisco Bay in California, northwards along the Canadian and Alaskan coasts to North American and Russian rivers draining into the Arctic Ocean, and southwards along the Asian coastal areas of Russia, Japan, and Korea (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C12"" data-open=""FSQ199C12"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Groot and Margolis, 1991</A>).</P><P>Understanding reasons for historical patterns in salmon abundance could help anticipate future <mark>climate</mark>-related changes. Various researchers (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C13"" data-open=""FSQ199C13"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Hare and Francis, 1995</A>; <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C3"" data-open=""FSQ199C3"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Beamish <EM>et al</EM>., 1999</A>) have hypothe­sized that the North Pacific Ocean alternates between high and low salmon production regimes. Low-frequency, high-amplitude variations in marine ecosystems involving changes in community composition, species abundances, and trophic structure are known as ecosystem regime shifts (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C30"" data-open=""FSQ199C30"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Polovina, 2005</A>). Shifts can be caused by <mark>climate</mark> factors, or anthropogenic factors including fishing, introduced species, and alterations in river discharge (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C19"" data-open=""FSQ199C19"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Jiao, 2009</A>). Integral to understanding <mark>climate change</mark> effects on salmon is an understanding of how variations in salmon abundance correspond to <mark>climate</mark>-related ecosystem regime shifts.</P><P>Statistical approaches to analysing regime shifts have fallen into two basic types: analyses requiring <EM>a priori</EM> hypotheses that regime shifts happened during particular years and exploratory or data-driven analyses not requiring <EM>a priori</EM> hypotheses on regime shift timings (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C32"" data-open=""FSQ199C32"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Rodionov, 2004</A>). We took the former approach, testing for differences resulting from regime shifts reported to have taken place approximately in 1947 and 1977 (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C1"" data-open=""FSQ199C1"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Beamish and Bouillon, 1993</A>; <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C10"" data-open=""FSQ199C10"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Francis and Hare, 1994</A>; <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C13"" data-open=""FSQ199C13"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Hare and Francis, 1995</A>), 1989 (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C14"" data-open=""FSQ199C14"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Hare and Mantua, 2000</A>), and 1999 (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C26"" data-open=""FSQ199C26"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">McFarlane <EM>et al.</EM>, 2000</A>; <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C29"" data-open=""FSQ199C29"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Peterson and Schwing, 2003</A>).</P><P>When considering potential <mark>climate change</mark> effects on salmon, it must be emphasized that the variable(s) being measured to represent salmon should be appropriate to the scale of the biological or geographical unit being assessed. Variables such as salmon abundance, biomass, distribution, growth, and survival can assist in understanding <mark>climate</mark> effects, but unfortunately, long time-series are uncommon. In this paper, we rely primarily on commercial catch data, because they are the longest, most consistently gathered data available for Pacific salmon. We regard salmon catch to be an appropriate proxy for their abundance, because our assessment units, taxonomic species in the eastern and western North Pacific, are large and we were examining low-frequency variability.</P><P>Our primary goal is to assess Pacific salmon abundance trends and review these from a <mark>climate change</mark> perspective. A secondary goal is to advise others interested in evaluating <mark>climate change</mark> effects on salmon of recently updated time-series of catch and hatchery release data. We apply relatively simple statistical approaches to estimates of commercial catch of the five major species that reproduce in both the Asian and the North American continents: pink salmon, <EM>O. gorbuscha</EM>; sockeye salmon, <EM>O. nerka</EM>; chum salmon, <EM>O. keta</EM>; coho salmon, <EM>O. kisutch</EM>; and Chinook salmon, <EM>O. tshawytscha.</EM> However, we do not consider Chinook or coho salmon in Asia, because directed fisheries on them are rare, records of their catch are inconsistent, and numbers are low.</P><H2 scrollto-destination=""12258440"" id=""12258440"" class=""section-title"" data-legacy-id=""s2"">Abundance proxies and general approach</H2><P>To index salmon abundance, we used recently revised datasets maintained by the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission, the international organization responsible for keeping official records of commercial catch and hatchery production in the North Pacific Ocean (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C18"" data-open=""FSQ199C18"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Irvine <EM>et al</EM>., 2009</A>), which we updated to include preliminary 2009 data. <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C24"" data-open=""FSQ199C24"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Kasahara (1963)</A> reviewed the early (pre-1961) portion of the catch time-series. Because some Asian statistics were inaccurate and some conversion factors were chosen rather arbitrarily, he cautioned that some estimates were “very rough”. North American catches were more reliable, in part because most salmon were caught within a few miles of the coast. <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C9"" data-open=""FSQ199C9"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Eggers <EM>et al</EM>.

Catches declined near the end of World War II and remained modest until the late 1970s, whereafter they generally increased. Significant differences within and between regimes 1 and 2 were uncommon (Table <A reveal-id=""FSQ199TB3"" data-open=""FSQ199TB3"" class=""link link-reveal link-table xref-fig"">3</A>). During regime 1, correlations were never different from zero, and during regime 2, the only significant correlation was decreasing pink salmon abundance. Mean abundances of pink and sockeye salmon declined between regimes 1 and 2. Significant positive trends were observed for sockeye and chum salmon during regime 3, but not for pink salmon; all three species were more abundant in regime 3 than regime 2. Significant positive trends in abundance were observed during regimes 4 and 5 for pink salmon and regime 5 for sockeye salmon.

Pink salmon catches declined in regime 3 and, although sockeye catch trends did not differ from zero, mean catches in regime 3 were lower than in regime 2. Similar to the patterns in the North Pacific, significant positive abundance trends were observed during regimes 4 and 5 for pink salmon and regime 5 for sockeye salmon. Regimes 4 and 5 abundances exceeded those of regime 3 for pink, chum, and sockeye salmon (Table <A reveal-id=""FSQ199TB3"" data-open=""FSQ199TB3"" class=""link link-reveal link-table xref-fig"">3</A>). There were no differences between regimes 4 and 5 for chum and pink salmon, implying that the reported regime shift in 1999 was not real.

High catches in the western North Pacific during the 1930s were apparently real (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C25"" data-open=""FSQ199C25"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Klyashtorin and Smirnov, 1995</A>), despite concerns of the validity of some early salmon catch estimates (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C24"" data-open=""FSQ199C24"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Kasahara, 1963</A>). Reduced catches in the western North Pacific near the end of World War II likely resulted from, at least in part, reduced effort and reporting. Statistical differences between regimes 1 and 2 would have been greater if we had ignored catches during 1945–1949 in our analyses.</P><P>Our general finding of lesser abundances in regime 2 than regimes 1 and 3 corroborates earlier findings of <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C10"" data-open=""FSQ199C10"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Francis and Hare (1994)</A>, <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C1"" data-open=""FSQ199C1"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Beamish and Bouillon (1993)</A>, <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C14"" data-open=""FSQ199C14"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Hare and Mantua (2000)</A>, and others. Regime shifts approximately in 1949, 1977, and 1989 were apparently <mark>climate</mark>-related. Understanding mechanisms for subsequent abundance changes is complicated by the generally increasing numbers of salmon released from hatcheries (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C2"" data-open=""FSQ199C2"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Beamish <EM>et al</EM>., 1997</A>).</P><P>In the western North Pacific, additional releases of hatchery fish have contributed to recent increased catches of pink and chum salmon, but so also have improvements to hatchery technology resulting in the release of fish in better condition with a greater likelihood of survival. For instance, an early emphasis in Russia on releasing large numbers of pink and chum salmon fry changed in the mid-1980s to releases of smaller numbers of healthier fry (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C7"" data-open=""FSQ199C7"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Dushkina, 1994</A>). During the past 15 years, releases of chum and pink salmon from Russian hatcheries gradually increased (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C18"" data-open=""FSQ199C18"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Irvine <EM>et al</EM>., 2009</A>), again with an emphasis on improved fish quality (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C23"" data-open=""FSQ199C23"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Kaev and Ignatiev, 2007</A>). Japanese hatcheries focus on chum salmon; numbers of chum salmon fry released increased rapidly in the late 1970s, but have been relatively stable over the past 25 years. Korea also produces chiefly chum salmon, but releases relatively few fish (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C18"" data-open=""FSQ199C18"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Irvine <EM>et al</EM>., 2009</A>).</P><P><A reveal-id=""FSQ199C16"" data-open=""FSQ199C16"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Hiroi (1998)</A> and <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C20"" data-open=""FSQ199C20"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Kaeriyama (1998)</A> reported increasing return rates (adult catches/juveniles released) for Japanese hatchery chum salmon from Hokkaido and Honshu, respectively, from the late 1970s through the early 1990s. <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C33"" data-open=""FSQ199C33"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Saito and Nagasawa (2009)</A> found that increased return rates for chum salmon from two regions in Hokkaido were related, at least in part, to increases in the size of fry released. <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C28"" data-open=""FSQ199C28"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Morita <EM>et al</EM>.

However, <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C27"" data-open=""FSQ199C27"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Morita <EM>et al</EM>. (2006b)</A> concluded that recent increases in Japanese pink salmon catch were largely explained by <mark>climate change</mark>. Regardless of the precise mechanism responsible for improved survival, the benefits from enhancement for the salmon catch in Asia have been significant.</P><P>In the eastern North Pacific, all five species are enhanced, with pink and chum salmon the major species in Alaska, sockeye and chum in Canada, and Chinook to the south. Hatchery releases in Alaska increased rapidly in the 1970s and the 1980s and since then have been relatively constant. In Canada, after peaking in the early 1990s, release numbers declined over the next decade and since then have been reasonably constant. In the southern United States, hatchery production has declined since the mid-1990s (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C18"" data-open=""FSQ199C18"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Irvine <EM>et al.</EM>, 2009</A>).</P><P>It is clear that many of the salmon in the North Pacific are of hatchery origin (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C15"" data-open=""FSQ199C15"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Hilborn and Eggers, 2000</A>; <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C21"" data-open=""FSQ199C21"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Kaeriyama, 2008</A>). Pink and chum salmon, the most numerous of the species and of which many enhanced, are released to the ocean early in their life when they are small. Therefore, almost all their biomass is accumulated in the marine environment. Consequently, regardless of whether wild salmon are being replaced by hatchery salmon, our results indicate that the ocean is producing more salmon biomass than previously. A better understanding of density-dependent effects and interactions among species and wild and hatchery salmon are needed to be confident about future <mark>climate</mark>-related effects on wild Pacific salmon.</P><P>We did not attempt to convert our ocean abundance indices to run-size biomass as <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C8"" data-open=""FSQ199C8"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Eggers (2009)</A>, <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C22"" data-open=""FSQ199C22"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Kaeriyama <EM>et al</EM>. (2009)</A>, and <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C11"" data-open=""FSQ199C11"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Fukuwaka <EM>et al</EM>. (2010)</A> have done recently. To the best of our knowledge, biomass time-series have not been developed for coho and Chinook salmon at the scale of the eastern North Pacific, and developing appropriate catch models to do so was beyond the scope of our study. Run-size biomass estimates include both fish that contribute to the next generation (i.e. spawners) and fish that do not (i.e. catch). If exploitation rates vary, so will the portion of the total biomass that contributes to the next generation, confounding the interpretation of total biomass time-series. Our approach assumed that commercial catch was proportional to overall abundance. We felt this was a reasonable assumption at the scale with which we are working. Because almost all the biomass of adult salmon is accumulated in the ocean, our estimates of catches in metric tonnes should be reasonable indices of biomass.</P><P><mark>Climate</mark> effects on salmon can be assessed at various scales, including species, regional stock groupings, and biological populations within stock groupings. In this study, species of Pacific salmon were assessed separately within the eastern and the western North Pacific Ocean, using catch trends as proxies of abundance. Aggregate catch statistics appeared to be reasonable abundance proxies at this scale, but would have masked differences with smaller units. When one wishes to assess smaller units of salmon, parameters other than catch should be examined, such as spawner numbers and estimates of survival or recruits-per-spawner. Appropriate salmon status indicators are scale-dependent.</P><P>In summary, our analyses confirm major <mark>climate</mark>-related changes in abundance associated with reported ecosystem regime shifts approximately in 1947, 1977, and 1989. There is little evidence to support a shift after 1989, although species abundance patterns varied during this recent period. The production of pink and chum salmon has continued to increase overall since 1990; coho and Chinook salmon in the eastern North Pacific have done relatively poorly, whereas sockeye salmon abundance patterns have been variable. Recent increases in pink and chum salmon are only partly the result of enhancement, because only in Russia have there been recent increases in hatchery releases, whereas catches in Russia and elsewhere have increased. Coho and Chinook declines after 1989 are partly explained by reduced effort in response to conservation concerns, but evidence of declining marine survivals for wild coho (<A reveal-id=""FSQ199C17"" data-open=""FSQ199C17"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Hobday and Boehlert, 2001</A>; <A reveal-id=""FSQ199C5"" data-open=""FSQ199C5"" class=""link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"">Beamish <EM>et al</EM>., 2008</A>) indicate a likely <mark>climate</mark> effect as well.</P><H2 scrollto-destination=""12258485"" id=""12258485"" class=""backacknowledgements-title"">Acknowledgements</H2><P>We thank other members of the NPAFC Stock Assessment Working Group for gathering and providing national datasets, Lana Fitzpatrick for assistance with data assembly, and two reviewers for constructive comments.</P><H2 scrollto-destination=""12258488"" id=""12258488"" class=""backreferences-title"">References</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The discussions elaborate on issues related to water resources, agriculture, and natural resources management, which are some of the most vital sectors for the region from environmental, social, and economic perspectives.Although the policies and measures discussed in the book are specific to the Asia and Pacific region, the key findings will be relevant to other regions as well; for example, Africa and Latin America.

                            </TIME><ARTICLE itemprop=""articleBody""><DIV class=""body-text""><P>Human-made <mark>climate change</mark> is, by its nature, difficult for the average person to witness. Even if you lived for a century, you may not physically notice two extra degrees of warmth or have the capacity to monitor sea-level rise as it creeps, inch by inch, up a beach. The margins are too small.</P><P>This truism, however, does not apply to wildfires, according to a new study from <mark>climate</mark> modelers at the University of Idaho and Columbia University’s Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO). The researchers found human-made — anthropogenic — <mark>climate change</mark> doubled the expansion of forest fires in the western United States over the last 31 years. The hardest-hit locations include places in the Pacific Northwest, such as the Cascade Mountains in eastern Oregon and eastern Washington, and the northern Rocky Mountain territories that cross Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote""><DIV class=""pullquote__quote"">So will the millennial era be remembered for when forest fires lost control? No, because it’s going to get worse — way worse.</DIV></ASIDE><P>“These are all areas where fires were especially influenced by <mark>climate change</mark>,” said Park Williams, an LDEO bioclimatologist and <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/10/07/1612926113.full"">co-author of the report published today in PNAS</A>. “Most things tend to be influenced pretty slowly by <mark>climate change</mark>. But forest fires are one of the systems on the planet that are showing a very strong effect.”</P><P>Here’s how Williams and his colleague John Abatzoglou measured this strong effect in the American West. Their analysis siphoned data from <mark>climate</mark> models for dryness and its ability to turn trees into tinder, which is known as fuel aridity. There’s no single silver bullet model, so they opted to use eight different metrics for fuel aridity that are commonly used by people who monitor fire danger.</P><P>They found a strong relationship between burned areas and fuel aridity — in that 76 percent of the changes in forest fire area from 1979 to 2015 could be tied to fuel aridity. The models agreed on which years were the driest, which years were the wettest, and they showed trend toward drying due to warming temperatures.</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote""><DIV class=""pullquote__quote"">Aside from the drier fire-prone conditions, every degree of warming increases lightning strikes in the U.S. by 12 percent.</DIV></ASIDE><P>“With every model, there is uncertainty. But that’s a pretty good fit given how messy fire data typically is,” said Mike Flannigan, a wildland fire expert at the University of Alberta who wasn’t involved with the study.</P><P>Next, the pair determined to what degree humans contributed to this increase in fuel aridity. They relied on the CMIP5 model, a project that assembles data from <mark>climate</mark> scientists across the globe. Each contributor uses their own <mark>climate</mark> models to run the same experiment, so the model can ultimately estimate how various factors — greenhouse gases, aerosols use or volcanic explosion — warm or cool the planet.</P><DIV id=""attachment_195185"" style=""width: 699px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Montana’s Roaring Lion fire burned close to 9,000 acres in late July and early August of this year. Photo by Mike Daniels</P></DIV><P>“These are very complex models, and they’re simulating the whole planet pretty comprehensively,” said Williams, which allowed the study to isolate the human contribution to global warming. “We could then go into a hypothetical world, where we say what if we didn’t have global <mark>climate change</mark> occur over the last century.”</P><P>The result, based on their estimates, would have been half as many fires in the western U.S. over the last three decades — from 1984 to 2015.</P><P>“I was surprised at how much these [fire danger] measures have increased in recent decades,” said Philip E. Dennison, a geographer at the University of Utah who <A href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GL059576/abstract"">has also observed an uptick of American West wildfires</A>. “Although this research does confirm what I have been hearing anecdotally from firefighters. They tell me that stands of forest that would never have been susceptible to fire in the past now seem drier and more prone to fire.”</P><P><STRONG>Can we fight these fires?</STRONG></P><P>So will the millennial era be remembered for when forest fires lost control? No, because it’s going to get worse — like way worse.</P><P>“There’s just no way around it. The 2020s and 2030s will have even more intense fires than we’re seeing now,” Williams said. “And the fires that we’re seeing now are far more intense than the ones we were seeing in the 1980s.”</P><P>Aside from the drier fire-prone conditions, every degree of warming <A href=""http://www.romps.berkeley.edu/2014/lightning/14lightning.pdf"">increases lightning strikes in the U.S. by 12 percent</A>. More lightning means more opportunities for wildfires. With increased fire, forests shift from sapping <mark>carbon</mark> from the atmosphere to becoming a greenhouse gas source, which may elevate global warming. Also, as the atmosphere warms, the air’s ability to hold moisture increases almost exponentially, Flanigan said, exacerbating fuel aridity.</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote""><DIV class=""pullquote__quote"">As the <mark>climate</mark> continues to change and temperature and moisture patterns change, our management of natural resources such as forests will also need to change.</DIV></ASIDE><P>If precipitation increases, then it can compensate for this fuel dryness,” Flanigan said. “But in <A href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293487415_Fuel_moisture_sensitivity_to_temperature_and_precipitation_<mark>Climate</mark>_change_implications"">recent work</A>, we found for every degree of warming, you need a 15 percent increase in precipitation for fire fuel moisture to stay the same. Almost none of the scenarios suggest that we’ll get those kinds of increases in precipitation.”</P><P>But Americans shouldn’t abandon hope because changes in fire management policy could prevent some losses.</P><P>“As the <mark>climate</mark> continues to change and temperature and moisture patterns change, our management of natural resources such as forests will also need to change,” Susan Jane Brown, an attorney and wildlife director at the Western Environmental Law Center. “In some places, we will need to carefully thin trees to release others so that they have enough moisture, light and resources to survive. We will also need to restore appropriate fire regimes, which means we will need to increase prescribed fire on many landscapes.”</P><DIV id=""attachment_195189"" style=""width: 699px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Over four days in 1996, the Charlton Butte Fire burned more than 10,400 acres of forest on the shore of Waldo Lake in Oregon. 19 years later, the forest begins to recover.

Photo by Erin Ross</P></DIV><P>She continued that studies like these will help land managers, the public and elected officials determine what types of steps are necessary to best cope with <mark>climate change</mark>. Flanigan agreed, saying that fire management can effectively insulate communities from forest fires. He recommended options like replacing conifers with deciduous trees, removing grass or using sprinklers to reduce fire intensity.</P><P>But Flanigan said people also need to change how they view forest fires. Most U.S. officials take the approach of putting out every single blaze, he said, but 99 percent of burn damage in the western U.S. caused by just one percent of the fire events.</P><P>“We can’t eliminate fire from landscapes. We’ve tried for 50 or 60 years, and how’s that going?” Flanigan said. Williams agreed, saying our country’s philosophy is to react rather than to be proactive.</P><P>“We wait for fire to get started, and then we try our best to fight it off. And every year to do that, we totally exhaust the forest service’s budget,” Williams said. “ And then they don’t have enough money to do proactive things like forest thinning, prescribed burning or public education. These are things that they should be doing and that they want to be doing, but they simply don’t have the funds.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV><ASIDE class=""post__aside post__aside--besideImage""><P class=""post__hero-caption""><SPAN>Left:</SPAN>

    </DIV></DIV><DIV class=""abstract"" data-ajax=""false""><H2>Abstract</H2><DIV><DIV class=""abstract1"">ABSTRACT The two leading modes of North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level pressure (SLP), as well as their connections to tropical variability, are explored in the 24 coupled <mark>climate</mark> models used in the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) to evaluate North Pacific decadal variability (NPDV) in the past [twentieth century; <mark>climate</mark> of the twentieth century (20C3M) scenario] and future [twenty-first century; Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario] <mark>climate</mark>. Results indicate that the two dominant modes of North Pacific oceanic variability, the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), do not exhibit significant changes in their spatial and temporal characteristics under greenhouse warming. However, the ability of the models to capture the dynamics associated with the leading North Pacific oceanic modes, including their link to the corresponding atmospheric forcing patterns and to tropical variability, is questionable. The temporal and spatial statistics of the North Pacific Ocean modes exhibit significant discrepancies from observations in their twentieth-century <mark>climate</mark>, most visibly for the second mode, which has significantly more low-frequency power and higher variance than in observations. The dynamical coupling between the North Pacific Ocean and atmosphere modes evident in the observations is very strong in the models for the first atmosphere–ocean coupled mode, which represents covariability of the PDO pattern with the Aleutian low (AL). However, the link for the second atmosphere–ocean coupled mode, describing covariability of an NPGO-like SST pattern with the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO), is not as clearly reproduced, with some models showing no relationship between the two. Exploring the tropical Pacific–North Pacific teleconnections reveals more issues with the models. In contrast with observations, the atmospheric teleconnection excited by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation in the models does not project strongly on the AL–PDO coupled mode because of the displacement of the center of action of the AL in most models. Moreover, most models fail to show the observational connection between El Niño Modoki–central Pacific warming and NPO variability in the North Pacific. In fact, the atmospheric teleconnections associated with El Niño Modoki in some models have a significant projection on, and excite the AL–PDO coupled mode instead. Because of the known links between tropical Pacific variability and NPDV, these analyses demonstrate that focus on the North Pacific variability of <mark>climate</mark> models in isolation from tropical dynamics is likely to lead to an incomplete view, and inadequate prediction, of NPDV.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""page_thumbnails_tab_contents"" class=""tabs-panel""><DIV id=""thumbnails"" class=""reading-length""><H2>Page Thumbnails</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Shrubs such as Wax Myrtle gradually take root as the dune accumulates soil, providing the stability that larger trees need to grow.</P><P> </P><P>As more vegetation comes in, the soil becomes richer and more fruitful, and the plants that thrive there boast root systems tolerant to high levels of salt and sand. Some even have a waxy coating on their leaves to protect them from sea spray.</P><P> </P><P>As anyone who has visited these island habitats can attest, maritime forests are green and lush with plant life, including the ubiquitous Live Oak, Eastern Red Cedar, Loblolly Pine, Southern Magnolia, Hickory, Cabbage Palm, Saw Palmetto and numerous epiphytes (a.k.a. air plants, such as Spanish moss). They’re usually bordered by grassland dunes, saltwater marshes and estuaries, making them a haven for a broad variety of both native and migratory wildlife species.</P><P> </P><FIGURE id=""attachment_14594"" style=""width: 391px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Osprey in Florida’s Ding Darling National Wildlife Refuge</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P> </P><P>“The combination of birds, reptiles and mammals found here keeps it interesting,” say naturalist Raleigh Nyenhuis. “Bald eagles and other raptors nest in the tops of the tall pines and prey on everything from cotton-tail rabbits to snakes and turtles. White-tail deer roam around, nibbling on low-lying plants.</P><P> </P><P>Populations of fallow deer, a non-native species brought over from Europe in the early 1900s, have also permeated the forests. Although they’re beautiful, they’re invasive and cause destruction to the vegetation as well. The eastern diamondback rattlesnake can be found from the dune ecosystem throughout most of the barrier island, but certainly favor our maritime forests, hiding in the shade of Saw Palmettos and waiting for small prey to come along.”</P><P> </P><FIGURE id=""attachment_17065"" style=""width: 690px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Spirit Bear in British Columbia, photo by Sherry Kirkvold courtesy WorldWildlife.org</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P> </P><P>The maritime forests of British Columbia, where First Nations tribes have lived in harmony with nature since the end of the Ice Age, are dominated by old growth conifers such as western red cedar, western hemlock and Sitka spruce, which rank among the largest trees on the planet. This larger-than-life setting is  home to a broad variety of spectacular wildlife, including three species of bear (black, grizzly and the rare Kermode “Spirit” bear), wolves, cougars and <A href=""https://greenglobaltravel.com/top-10-mountains-in-the-world-for-your-world-travel-bucket-list/"">mountain</A> goats.</P><P> </P><P>Let’s not forget the abundant marine life that can be found just off the coast of these maritime forests, which includes whales, dolphins, sharks and, in the waters off of British Columbia, the salmon on which many of the forest’s predators ultimately feed. And of course there are the myriad other fish and shellfish that feed the people living in and traveling to these coastal communities.</P><P> </P><P>The ocean, <A href=""https://greenglobaltravel.com/beach-vacation-packing-list/"">beach</A>, maritime forest and tidal marshland ecosystems are all inextricably connected. It’s this delicate ecological balance that makes places like Georgia’s Cumberland Island and BC’s Great Bear Rainforest so incredibly special. But it’s also what makes them especially vulnerable to environmental changes.</P><P> </P><FIGURE id=""attachment_15417"" style=""width: 648px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Sunset in Estuary on Sanibel Island, Florida</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H3 style=""text-align: center;""><SPAN style=""color: #008000;""><B>THE THREAT OF <mark>CLIMATE CHANGE</mark></B></SPAN></H3><P>Barrier islands serve an important role, not only for the people and animals that inhabit them, but also for mainland coastal areas. Their dunes and forests help to break up ocean swells, literally serving as a barrier for the lagoons, estuaries, marshes and coast behind them. They also help to protect the mainland from devastating weather patterns, such as hurricanes and other tropical storms.</P><P> </P><P>The majority of the world’s scientists believe that global warming– the term used to describe the gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere– is creating a permanent change in the planet’s <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P> </P><P>But most of the energy generated by the unprecedented <mark>climate change</mark>s documented over the past century has gone into warming the planet’s oceans. And there are growing concerns about the long-term impact these changes could have on barrier islands and coastal regions around the world.</P><P> </P><FIGURE id=""attachment_16186"" style=""width: 690px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Roseate Spoonbills on South Padre Island, TX</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P> </P><P>Andy MacKinnon, the author of <I><A href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1551055309?keywords=Plants%20of%20Coastal%20British%20Columbia%20and%20Alaska&amp;qid=1445816194&amp;ref_=sr_1_3&amp;sr=8-3""><STRONG>Plants of the Pacific Northwest Coast</STRONG></A> </I>(who has been referred to as “the Rock Star of Botanists”), illustrates a few of the ways rising temperatures are already beginning to impact the ocean in the Pacific Northwest.</P><P> </P><P>“Our marine waters are warming and becoming more acidic, and they’re predicted to become even more so as this century progresses,” he cautions. “Salmon have narrow temperature tolerances and will likely become more abundant in rivers further north, and less abundant in southern rivers. We’re already beginning to see problems in aquaculture: Due to lower pH levels, shellfish spat can’t form proper shells. Current projections are for longer summertime droughts in some areas, which could lead to increasing incidence of fire, insects and disease in our forests.”</P><P> </P><FIGURE id=""attachment_5231"" style=""width: 648px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Fighting Conch on Sanibel Island, FL</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P> </P><P>Even more troubling is the accelerated rise in Global Mean Sea Level since the early 1900s caused by rising temperatures melting glaciers and polar ice caps, particularly in the Arctic. Between 1870 and 2004, global average sea levels are estimated to have risen a total of 195 mm. At the current annual rate of acceleration, the 1990 to 2100 sea level rise would range from 280 to 340 mm, affecting most of the world’s coastal communities.</P><P> </P><P>“This sea level rise is impeding into freshwater ecosystems throughout the maritime forest,” says Nyenhuis, “which is having a negative impact on several amphibian species. Sea level rise may also decrease the amount of salt marsh we have, and eventually decrease maritime forest habitat. The decrease in these habitats will influence all of the wildlife that depends on these areas for survival. The interdependence between the maritime forest and the ocean is apparent: Once the ocean begins expanding, the salt marsh and maritime forest will begin decreasing.”</P><P> </P><FIGURE id=""attachment_17061"" style=""width: 464px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Maritime Forest in Jekyll Island, GA</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P> </P><H3 style=""text-align: center;""><SPAN style=""color: #008000;""><B>SPEAKING FOR THE TREES</B></SPAN></H3><P>Fortunately, scientists, government organizations and a variety of non-profit conservation groups have long recognized both the intrinsic value of barrier islands and maritime forests and the need to protect them.</P><P> </P><P>Professor Byers points out that much of Georgia’s nearly 100 miles of coastline and 378,000 acres of salt marsh (33% of the total left on the East Coast) have some form of federal, state or private conservation protection, including Cumberland Island, Jekyll Island, Ossabaw Island and St. Catherine’s Island. And organizations such as Coastal Conservation Association Georgia, Georgia Conservancy and the Southern Environmental Law Center work tirelessly to improve the overall ecological health of the Georgia coast.</P><P> </P><P>“One of our local agencies, The St. Simons Land Trust, has purchased a 600-acre, intact maritime forest on the north end of St. Simons Island,” adds Nyenhuis. “This area is open to locals and visitors alike to  enjoy. The Nature Conservancy has recently received the entire island of Little St. Simons as a donation. They will now be able to protect and maintain the island forever.”</P><P> </P><FIGURE id=""attachment_17067"" style=""width: 690px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">The Great Bear Rainforest, photo courtesy SaveTheGreatBear.org</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P> </P><P>That’s not to say that the threat to these forests and barrier islands is over: The fight against over-development, lax enforcement of environmental laws and the effects of global warming is constant. But there are many agencies doing their part to protect and maintain maritime forests, and an increasing number of responsible tourism options that help fund conservation efforts in the region.</P><P> </P><P>Naturally, Nyenhuis hopes the future will bring even more. “Personally, I’d love to see more  acreage of maritime forest protected by local, national and worldwide agencies,” she says. “The more protected area we have, the more species we’ll see thriving along our beautiful coastline. Not only does this help the wildlife, but it ensures the enrichment of human lives for centuries to come.” <STRONG><EM>–Bret Love; photos by Bret Love &amp; Mary Gabbett unless otherwise noted</EM></STRONG></P><P> </P></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Predicting the behavior of the El Niño weather cycle is a challenge for forecasters and <mark>climate</mark> scientists, and the stakes are high.</P><P>
El Niño and its counterpart La Niña, driven by changes in sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, can have major effects on weather conditions hundreds and thousands of miles away. Studies have linked catastrophic floods, droughts, disease outbreaks, wildfires and even social unrest to the weather cycle, known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.</P><P>
Yet scientists have struggled to understand whether <mark>climate change</mark> is altering that cycle. <mark>Climate</mark> models have produced conflicting results, and reliable instrumental records of ENSO events begin in the early 20th century.</P><P>
Now a new study, which builds on prior efforts to reconstruct El Niño's past behavior by examining coral growth, suggests that El Niño and La Niña events have become more variable and intense over the past several decades.</P><P>&quot;We kind of answered the question, is El Niño changing with respect to recent natural variability?&quot; said Kim Cobb, the Georgia Institute of Technology <mark>climate</mark> scientist who led the research published yesterday in the journal <EM>Science</EM>. &quot;The answer is yes, tentatively so.&quot;</P><P>
The 7,000-year portrait painted by the corals she examined suggests El Niño may get stronger as the level of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere climbs, Cobb said.</P><P>
But researchers will need to do more work -- including a concerted effort to fill gaps in the record of El Niño's past behavior -- to prove that connection, for now a tentative one, she said.</P><P>&quot;It could be thrown out,&quot; Cobb said. &quot;But whatever the result, we will have confidence with more data.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Coral cores tell the story</STRONG>
The new analysis is based on samples that Cobb describes as a data &quot;down payment,&quot; tripling the amount of coral-core data available from the past 7,000 years.</P><P>
Cobb and her colleagues extracted 17 cores from fossilized corals on two tiny islands, Christmas and Fanning, in the Line Islands archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean.</P><P>
Researchers painstakingly examined each core millimeter by millimeter, using radioactive dating to determine the age of each sample.</P><P>
To determine how temperature and precipitation had changed during each coral's lifetime, the scientists tracked variations in the ratio of two oxygen isotopes, O-18 and O-16. During warm, rainy El Niño periods, the coral that grows has less O-18. During cool, drier La Niña events, new coral has more O-18.</P><P>
Cobbling together the data from those 17 coral samples -- each covering a period 20 to 80 years long -- allowed the scientists to reconstruct the ENSO cycle thousands of years into the past.</P><P>
The results show that the variability and strength of the ENSO cycle was greater during the 20th century than at most points in the 7,000-year fossil record -- but the episode is not unprecedented, the scientists said, pointing to a similar period during the early 17th century.</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>wire with permission from Environment &amp; Energy Publishing, LLC. <A href=""https://www.eenews.net"" target=""_blank"">www.eenews.net</A>, 202-628-6500</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3><SECTION class=""article-author""><DIV class=""article-author__main""><P class=""article-author__desc t_body t_body--article"">Lauren Morello works for <A href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/index.html"" target=""_blank""><EM>Nature</EM></A> magazine.</P><DIV class=""article-author__suggested""><H4 class=""article-author__suggested__title"">Recent Articles</H4></DIV></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The catch is that your environmental program must take place within 30 miles of a Georgia-Pacific facility. The good news is that those facilities are spread across 32 states.</P><P><STRONG>PROFILE:</STRONG> The <A href=""http://www.gp.com/Company/Community/Foundation"">Georgia-Pacific Foundation</A> was established in 1958 by the papermaking and manufacturing company now headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Supporting the environment is pretty standard for manufacturers, and Georgia-Pacific is no exception. The Environemnt is one of <A href=""http://www.gp.com/Company/Community/Foundation/Areas-of-Investment#Education"">four areas of “investment”</A> for this foundation (the other three are Education, Enrichment and Entrepreneurship).</P><P>Also like many foundations with manufacturing corporate arms, support of environmental programs is most focused on conservation. The foundation also lists clean air, clean water, recycling, and environmental education as its other areas of environmental focus--so much the better if your conservation program interrelates among these.</P><P>How the Georgia-Pacific Foundation does distinguish itself from other environmental funders is that its funding always comes as general operating support. But even though it generalizes its funding, this foundation has rigorous expectations for your conservation program's impact, with an application that asks you to discuss how you will be able to tangibly measure improvement in the community you serve as a result of it. Rest assured, the foundation has a lofty vision of purpose, too (it likes to use the word “potential”) so do not be deterred from pitching a project that aspires as much as it provides measurable, results-oriented outcomes—just be sure not to forsake the latter.</P><P>In terms of those communities in which the Georgia-Pacific Foundation seeks environmental conservation: your program must be located within 30 miles of one of <A href=""http://www.gp.com/company/company-overview/locations"">Georgia-Pacific’s facilities</A>. The company has a presence in 32 states, with multiple locations in many (10 in Texas, nine in Oregon, seven in California, four in Virginia, and four in Michigan, for example) so this geographic restriction still allows for a lot of eligibility for a foundation grant.</P><P>The Georgia-Pacific Foundation places no strict parameters on grant amounts, instead stating &quot;when deciding what or if we will contribute, we consider the value of the program to our communities and the amount we have available to donate.&quot; But you will be required to put a specific ask amount into your application. For environmental giving, the basic range is $1,000 to $10,000 (with outliers on both sides).</P><P>Recent environmental conservation grantees include:</P><UL><LI>$65,000 to the <A href=""http://beltline.org/about/the-atlanta-beltline-people/atlanta-beltline-partnership/"">Beltline Partnership</A> (Atlanta, GA)</LI><LI>$20,000 to the <A href=""https://www.georgiaconservancy.org/"">Georgia Conservancy</A> (Atlanta, GA)</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Examples of these fluctuations are the El Niño Southern Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation, and changes in the Meridional Overturning Circulation. Superimposed on these types of natural ocean variability, are the <mark>climate</mark> trends induced by human activities like <mark>CO2</mark> emissions over the last centuries. The ocean has absorbed about 50% of the <mark>CO2</mark> emissions from anthropogenic sources and has buried in its interior a large fraction of the surface heating, therefore contributing to a slow down of the effects of greenhouse warming. However, the natural and anthropogenic changes do not act in isolation and are inter-connected with changes in the physical, chemical and biological dimensions of the ocean environment, often triggering important coupled feedback. This makes studying the ocean dynamics a complex and interdisciplinary challenge.  </P><P>A short video by NASA that uses a variety of satellite products to illustrate the role of the ocean in Earth's <mark>climate</mark> and life.</P><P>At Georgia Tech we combine a variety of observational, modeling and statistical approaches to understand the mechanisms controlling the different dimensions of ocean dynamics and its role on Earth’s life and <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P> </P><H4>Earth System Modeling and Data Science</H4><P>New remote sensing technologies such as satellites (e.g. NASA video above), unmanned vehicles and ocean floats, and other in situ technologies generate massive streams of ocean and <mark>climate</mark> data, both at global and regional scales. While these measurements are key to help scientists to understand the ocean state and its dynamics, the synthesis of these large amount of data, and the prediction of the future evolution of the ocean and <mark>climate</mark> rely on Earth System Models (ESMs). ESMs are computer models that simulate the interactions between ocean, atmosphere, land, cryosphere, and biosphere to provide a comprehensive and multi-scale view of Earth’s <mark>climate</mark> under a wide range of conditions (e.g. from future <mark>climate change</mark> to the last glacial period). At Georgia Tech OSE researchers collaborate with several groups across campus, for example in the College of Computing, to combine the available observational data with ESMs. The goal is to diagnose robust <mark>climate</mark> processes, and detect <mark>climate</mark> anomalies across the physical, biological, chemical and human dimensions of regional and global ocean systems.</P><P><SPAN style=""letter-spacing: 0.4px;"">Given that </SPAN>ESMs<SPAN style=""letter-spacing: 0.4px;""> also generate massive data streams, OSE has parterned with </SPAN><SPAN style=""letter-spacing: 0.4px;"">the Institute for Data Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech to implement advanced statistics, machine learning and data mining methods for diagnosing the ocean and <mark>climate</mark> dynamics from the </SPAN>ESMs<SPAN style=""letter-spacing: 0.4px;""> and global/regional </SPAN><SPAN style=""letter-spacing: 0.4px;"">observing </SPAN><SPAN style=""letter-spacing: 0.4px;"">ne</SPAN><SPAN style=""letter-spacing: 0.4px;"">twor</SPAN><SPAN style=""letter-spacing: 0.4px;"">k</SPAN><SPAN style=""letter-spacing: 0.4px;"">s</SPAN><SPAN style=""letter-spacing: 0.4px;"">.</SPAN></P><P> </P><H4>Biogeochemical Cycles</H4><P>Nitrogen and phosphorus are essential elements to life on Earth.  Their transformations in the oceans have an important effect on the <mark>carbon</mark> cycle. With regard to the nitrogen cycle, most reactions are catalyzed by microorganisms. Thus, it is key to determine the rates, pathways, and microbial groups responsible for the transformation of fixed nitrogen or biologically available nitrogen (i.e., NH4+, NO2-, NO3-). As fixed nitrogen often limits production in the world’s oceans, investigations specifically target the microbial processes (denitrification, anammox) responsible for the removal of fixed nitrogen from ecosystems.</P><P>With regard to the phosphorus cycle, it is key to understand the role of organic phosphorus compounds that are found ubiquitously in the water column of the oceans. Newly developed electrodialysis-reverse osmosis techniques have allowed researchers to isolate and preconcentrate marine dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) which is characterized using NMR and various wet chemical techniques. Simultaneously, the accumulation and storage of phosphorus in marine phytoplankton is studied using synchrotron-based x-ray spectromicroscopic techniques.</P><P>Finally, iron is a micronutrient that limits primary production in some regions of the oceans, the High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) zones. Predicting the effect of iron limitation on the <mark>carbon</mark> cycle requires understanding of both oceanic and atmospheric processes such as sediment transport and fluxes, ocean organic ligands and aerosols deposition. By combining models and observations we can quantify how the atmospheric circulation affects iron inputs and primary production in the upper ocean and how sediments coupled to ocean vertical mixing may provide a significant source of iron to sustain primary production in surface waters.</P><TABLE border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" style=""width: 100%;""><TBODY><TR><TD><P>&quot;Polluted Dust Can Impact Ocean Life Thousands of Miles Away, Study Says&quot;</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P> </P><H4>Paleoceanography</H4><P>Paleo<mark>climate</mark> data are becoming increasingly important in <mark>climate</mark> science, as more accurate regional projections of future <mark>climate change</mark> require knowledge of <mark>climate</mark> variability over the past.

Georgia Piggot and Peter Erickson </SPAN></P><DIV class=""news-content"" itemprop=""articleBody""><P><STRONG>This week, negotiators are gathered in Germany for the annual <A href=""http://newsroom.unfccc.int/cop-23-bonn/"" target=""_blank"">UN <mark>climate change</mark> conference</A>. If previous meetings are any indication, the negotiating halls will be strangely silent on one obvious contributor to <mark>climate change</mark>: fossil fuel production.</STRONG></P><P>Oil, gas and coal production have long been ignored in global <mark>climate</mark> talks, largely to avoid conflict between fossil fuel producing nations and the rest of the world. In fact, the text of the <A href=""https://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Paris Agreement</A> on <mark>climate change</mark> doesn’t include the phrase “fossil fuels.”</P><P>This silence can’t continue forever. Evidence shows that we need to <A href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v517/n7533/full/nature14016.html"" target=""_blank"">slow the development of fossil fuel resources</A> to meet the Agreement’s goals. It’s time for world leaders – through the UN Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (UNFCCC) – to admit the problem and work on the solution.</P><P>Now is an opportune moment. UNFCCC negotiators are developing the “rulebook” for delivering the Paris Agreement. If these hard-fought rules for implementing Paris do not consider fossil fuel production now, it is unlikely that countries will revise them any time soon. By that time, it could be too late – an orderly, <A href=""http://priceofoil.org/2016/09/22/the-skys-limit-report/"" target=""_blank"">managed decline</A> in fossil fuels may no longer be possible while still keeping warming below 2C.</P><P>But we have options. While the Paris Agreement doesn’t mention fossil fuels by name, it does provide many opportunities to phase-down fossil fuel production – if <mark>climate</mark> negotiators use the options at their disposal.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Peter Erickson is discussing this issue with Pacific island leaders and civil society representatives at a <A href=""https://www.sei-international.org/cop23/fossil-fuels"" target=""_blank"">panel event</A> in the Talanoa Space, Bonn zone at 17:30 on Wednesday 8 November.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>In a <A href=""https://www.sei-international.org/publications?pid=3220"" target=""_blank"">new SEI paper</A>, we detail these opportunities. Some are remarkably simple: countries, for example, could add targets for phasing down fossil fuel production to the commitments they have already made under the Paris Agreement. Currently, those commitments – called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – only outline countries’ goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>This would provide an important signal to other nations that a transition away from fossil fuels is underway. Through this and other unilateral actions – such as limiting new fossil fuel infrastructure and removing subsidies – countries can act now without waiting for international agreement.</P><P>Collectively, nations could track fossil fuel production in the planned “global stocktake” – a check-in every five years on progress towards the Paris Agreement goals. There is no reason why the stocktake couldn’t include monitoring the alignment of fossil fuel production with temperature reduction goals.</P><P>Countries also could ensure some of the financial resources promised under the Agreement are used to support nations moving away from fossil fuels. For instance, countries could earmark some of these resources for a “just transitions” fund, which could be used to help ensure workers and communities hit hardest by an energy transition are not left behind.</P><P>There is momentum building for a global phase-down of fossil fuel extraction. France has <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2017/06/30/france-ban-new-oil-gas-exploration-beginning-autumn/"" target=""_blank"">proposed a ban</A> on oil and gas exploration, India has placed a <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2016/03/04/india-doubles-tax-coal/"" target=""_blank"">tax on coal</A>, and Pacific Island nations have raised the idea of an <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/14/pacific-islands-nations-consider-worlds-first-treaty-to-ban-fossil-fuels"" target=""_blank"">international fossil fuel treaty</A>. More than forty countries signed up to a Communiqué by the <A href=""http://fffsr.org/"" target=""_blank"">Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform</A>, which calls for ending the use of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.</P><P>Let’s build on this progress and carry this momentum into the negotiating room. It’s time for nations that are willing to lead to stand up.</P><P><EM><A href=""http://sei-us.org/about/staff_person/72"" target=""_blank"">Georgia Piggot</A> and <A href=""http://sei-us.org/about/staff_person/6"" target=""_blank"">Peter Erickson</A> are staff scientists at the Stockholm Environment Institute</EM></P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

The transaction would be the biggest ever for Wichita, Kansas-based Koch.Chief Executive Officer Charles Koch, whose family controls the company his father founded during the Depression, is taking over a business threatened by rising energy costs and sluggish paper and lumber prices. International Paper Co. and Smurfit- Stone Container Corp. are among forest-products companies that are trying to cope by shutting mills or selling assets.``We view the deal as attractive,'' said Claudia Shank, an analyst at J.P. Morgan in New York who calculates Koch is paying 7.5 times Georgia-Pacific's estimated 2005 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. ``The news is also positive for the broader paper and forest products sector, as it signals that private-equity interest in the sector is alive and well.''Shares of Georgia-Pacific have fallen 7.5 percent this year and trade at 12 times earnings, compared with 18.8 times for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Paper and Forest Products Index. The Atlanta-based company's third-quarter profit fell 40 percent.<STRONG>Frustration</STRONG>Georgia-Pacific Chief Executive Officer Alston ``Pete'' Correll, who will remain with the business, chose to sell after becoming frustrated with his company's depressed share price, the London-based Financial Times reported on its Web site.``The credibility of public-company CEOs is at an all-time low in this country, and we're all spending a lot of time trying to convince the world that we're doing the right thing,'' the paper quoted Correll as saying, citing an interview.Koch has annual revenue of more than $60 billion, compared with $19.66 billion at Georgia-Pacific. A combination of the two businesses would put Koch ahead of Cargill Inc., which had sales of $71.1 billion in the 12 months through June, its Web site says, and currently ranks as the biggest closely held company in the U.S., according to Forbes magazine.The purchase comes after Koch in May 2004 acquired two mills in Brunswick, Georgia, and New Augusta, Mississippi, from Georgia-Pacific for $610 million. The mills make fluff pulp used in diapers, baby wipes and sanitary products.<STRONG>Asbestos Suits</STRONG>Georgia-Pacific has been hurt by asbestos-related legal settlements, falling lumber prices and rising energy costs. It has sold paper and lumber mills to reduce debt to $7.94 billion.Correll has spent the past five years transforming Georgia- Pacific from a paper and lumber maker into one that relies mainly on consumer tissues. He spun off the company's timberlands in 2001 and sold the lumber-distribution unit last year.The tissue business represented 51 percent of Georgia- Pacific's $1.34 billion in pretax profit in the first three quarters. Correll was slated to retire next year and was likely to be replaced by President Lee Thomas.``Valuations for forestry companies are pretty low and there's still a lot of excess capacity out there, so this may be the first step in the round of consolidation we've been expecting,'' said Katja Keitaanniemi, an analyst at eQ Bank in Helsinki. ``The premium is pretty high though.''<STRONG>Reinvestment</STRONG>Koch, in an open letter to Georgia-Pacific workers, said it reinvests as much as 90 percent of profits back into its businesses to fuel growth.``We have extensive experience with cyclical, highly competitive businesses and the ability to commit appropriate resources to enhance the company's assets and pursue a growth agenda,'' Koch Chief Executive Charles Koch said in the statement.Charles Koch's father, Fred C. Koch, founded the business after developing a process for refining more gasoline from crude oil in 1928, the company said on its Web site. Charles Koch and his brother, David, bought out brothers Frederick and William, David's fraternal twin, for $1 billion in 1983, according to Hoover's Inc.William and Frederick Koch later claimed they were shortchanged and sued their brothers and even their mother over her distribution of trust-fund money, Hoover's said. They lost their case against Charles and David Koch in 1998.<STRONG>Conservative Links</STRONG>The Koch family has been linked to conservative politics since the days of founder Fred Koch, who helped found the John Birch Society, which campaigned against communism in U.S. politics during the 1950s, Hoover's said. David Koch ran for U.S. vice president on the Libertarian party ticket in 1980.Koch Industries has expanded its oil refining and added pipelines, engineering businesses and ranching. It now has interests in chemicals, fertilizer and asphalt, and in 2004 sold its Entergy-Koch energy trading business to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.Koch last year acquired an Alaska refinery and a 3 percent interest in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System from Williams Cos.; chemicals business and assets from BP Plc, and fiber and polymers businesses from DuPont Co.As a unit of Koch, Georgia-Pacific will be able to focus on long-term profit growth rather than quarterly results, Georgia- Pacific spokeswoman Robin Keegan said.``It's more difficult to make long-term investments sometimes when you're operating as a publicly held company,'' Keegan said. ``You can weather business cycles better and make decisions better to optimize long-term profits.''<STRONG>Competitors</STRONG>Georgia-Pacific, the maker of Brawny paper towels, competes with Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Svenska Cellulosa AB in the tissue business. In North America, the company is the biggest plywood maker and third-biggest maker of boxes, used mostly in shipping.Georgia-Pacific, which will retain its name and headquarters, today also announced that it would buy back $2.6 billion in bond debt. The company's debt increased after its 2000 purchase of tissue maker Fort James.Georgia-Pacific said on Oct. 27 that third-quarter net income dropped 40 percent to $145 million, or 55 cents a share, as box prices fell and costs rose for chemicals, energy and wood. Prices for lumber and plywood also have fallen over the past year, hurting the company's earnings, as the industry's production increased.Forest products companies have struggled to boost their stocks because of falling paper and lumber prices and increasing costs for raw materials, natural gas and shipping. Natural gas futures have risen more than sixfold since September, 2001 in New York.<STRONG>International Paper</STRONG>International Paper, the biggest paper maker in North America, plans to sell off as much as $10 billion in assets, including its timberlands, beverage packaging and lumber businesses to focus on investing in its main paper and box units. Its stock has fallen 27 percent over the past year.Weyerhaeuser, which on Oct. 21 announced plans to close a pulp mill, also may sell some units. Shares of the company, the world's biggest lumber maker, have fallen 6.9 percent over the past year.Smurfit-Stone Container, the biggest box maker in North America, on Nov. 9 said it would shut as much as 20 percent of its box-making plants after the stock had fallen 42 percent in a year.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised Georgia-Pacific while Citigroup Inc. advised Koch, according to the statement.</P><DIV class=""amp amp-pri-tag""><SPAN class=""amp-pri-tag-label"">AMP Section Name:</SPAN><SPAN class=""amp-pri-tag-value"">Natural Resources</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
