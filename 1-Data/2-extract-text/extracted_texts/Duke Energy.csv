This extraordinary vote calls for the board of directors of Occidental Petroleum to oversee scenario analysis by the company to analyze its business plans and practices against a range of scenarios including one where global temperature rise is limited to 2 degrees Celsius. </STRONG></P><P><STRONG>The resolution was led by Ceres Investor Network member Wespath Investment Management and co-filed by Ceres Investor Network members Nathan Cummings Foundation, Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Fund, CalPERS, and New York City Pension Funds, with crucial support coming from investment giant and Ceres Investor Network member BlackRock.</STRONG> </P><P><STRONG>The successful vote is a clear endorsement of key draft recommendations of the G20 Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on <mark>Climate</mark> Related Financial Disclosures regarding scenario analysis, including two degree scenario analysis as a key tool for assessing the risks and opportunities presented by global transition to a clean energy economy consistent with the objectives of the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement. Coming only a day after oil and gas industry-funded analysis by IHS Markit sought to question the Task Force’s recommendations, it indicates that investors see central elements of the recommendations as credible and necessary. Today’s vote sends a strong positive signal in support of similar shareholder resolutions that await votes at the annual general meetings of other fossil fuel companies in the weeks ahead.</STRONG></P><P>Original Blog Post:</P><P>Investors are sending a powerful signal again this year on shareholder resolutions aimed at energy companies and their strategies for competing in a low-<mark>carbon</mark> global future.</P><P>No doubt, <mark>climate change</mark> is a material risk that companies – especially energy firms – must address. Many feared that shifting political winds could reverse global momentum to accelerate the low <mark>carbon</mark> future, but early votes on U.S. shareholder proposals calling on companies to conduct two-degree scenario analysis make clear that investors see market forces still favoring clean energy. And these market forces are driving mainstream financial market actors such as asset managers, asset owners, credit ratings agencies and insurers to demand better disclosure of the results. (The <A href=""https://www.ceres.org/2DSResolutions"">two-degree scenario resolutions</A> stem directly from the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement’s goal to curb <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> at levels that would limit average global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius.)</P><P>Investors recognize the transition towards a clean, low <mark>carbon</mark> economy is not slowing down. Instead, rapidly falling costs for renewable energy technologies (wind, solar and storage batteries) and growing demand for cleaner air in emerging economies like China and India, are all shifting the balance to cleaner, more modern resources and systems for delivering energy. As a result, investors increasingly want to know how companies are planning to mitigate risks and seize opportunities in this new global paradigm.</P><P>Electric utility AES Corporation presented a particularly interesting case this year because the company did provide some new disclosures in its November 2016 report, <EM>Strategy for Environmental Performance,</EM> and it recently announced plans to acquire a leading storage battery company and wind projects in Brazil.</P><P>Nonetheless, the company continues to invest heavily in natural gas and liquefied natural gas without assuring investors that it has adequately assessed the potential impacts of lower demand scenarios consistent with market trends and the Paris Agreement’s goals.</P><P>“Investors understand that the energy transition is inevitable from an economic and environmental perspective. We need to know how companies are planning to succeed and create opportunities to provide clean energy in this new environment,” said Mary Minette, director of shareholder advocacy at Mercy Investment Services. &quot;We need to know that the company has a comprehensive strategy rather than a piecemeal approach, and we look forward to working with AES to make progress.”</P><P>Mercy Investment Services filed the resolution, which garnered 40 percent support, despite the company’s full court press to sway investors to vote no.</P><P>Investors are achieving strong votes on similar resolutions at other energy companies, including 41 percent at Marathon Petroleum (a major U.S. refining company), 48 percent at Ameren, 48 percent at Dominion Resources, 46 percent at <mark>Duke Energy</mark> and 45 percent at DTE Energy. Given that significant voting blocs are controlled by company insiders and investors who reflexively vote with management, these levels of support are nearly unprecedented.</P><P>The ongoing work of the G-20 Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on <mark>Climate</mark>-Related Financial Disclosures has reinforced the broad consensus that two-degree scenario analysis is a critical tool for managing <mark>climate</mark> risks.</P><P>In addition, Moody’s Investor Services recently <A href=""https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1065443&amp;WT.mc_id=AEP~PBC_1065443&amp;token=EQR9geA9I2QpLtIc3cPEx4w4nOMm337X"">released a report</A> detailing the credit risks that the low-<mark>carbon</mark> transition presents for the oil and gas industry. Furthermore, Moody’s concluded that companies with higher levels of disclosure—including disclosures regarding scenario planning—will be viewed as having a lower transition risk profile, while those who fail to disclose in line with TCFD recommendations will be viewed as higher risk.</P><P>As companies move to meet this demand for better disclosures, those who fail to respond risk falling behind.</P><P>Companies like ExxonMobil claim that they don’t want to disclose the results of two-degrees scenario analysis because they don’t believe that the world is likely to achieve the two-degree target, but that fails to fully acknowledge the purpose of scenario analysis.</P><P>As global consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company <A href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/from-scenario-planning-to-stress-testing-the-next-step-for-energy-companies"">recently explained</A>, “[A]t times like the present, it is extreme risks, not the everyday ones, that should most concern energy companies. Likewise, it is the prospect of chaotic overnight change, not gradual shifts, that should keep energy executives awake at night.”</P><P>Two-degree scenario analysis, and scenario analysis more generally, is an exercise in ensuring that the company’s portfolio is resilient to a variety of potentially divergent futures. As the energy transition continues – driven not only by <mark>climate</mark> policies but also by rapidly advancing technological and geopolitical disruptions – this type of exercise is at the heart of prudent risk management and good governance.</P><P>All eyes are on remaining annual corporate meetings in the next few weeks, where investors have the opportunity to weigh in on the <A href=""https://www.ceres.org/2DSResolutions"">two-degrees scenario resolutions</A> at at ExxonMobil, Devon Energy, First Energy, PPL Corporation, Southern Company and Hess.</P><P>Stay tuned.</P><P><I>Investors who wish to publicly declare their support for these resolutions can do so </I><A href=""https://ceres.secure.force.com/2DSResolutions/"">here</A><I>.</I></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class=""home-page-experts row""><DIV class=""container""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-lg-10 col-lg-push-1""><DIV class=""row""><H2 class=""section-title text-center"">Meet The Experts</H2><DIV class=""experts-list clearfix""><DIV class=""text-center expert-container""><DIV class=""expert-content""><P class=""expert-org"">Director, <mark>Carbon</mark> Asset Risk</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""universal-section-desc no-mar-bottom text-center dot-ellipsis dot-resize-update author-bio-wrapper dot-height-250""><P>Shanna is the director of <mark>carbon</mark> asset risk at Ceres.</P><P>Shanna collaborates with the <mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker Initiative and the Global Investor Coalition on <mark>Climate Change</mark> to prevent shareholder capital from being wasted on developing high-<mark>carbon</mark>, high-cost fossil fuel reserves that cannot be burned if the world is to avoid catastrophic <mark>climate change</mark> and drive fossil fuel companies to acknowledge and plan for the escalating physical impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> such as sea level rise, stronger storms and more severe droughts.

He became convinced that legislation to curb sulfur dioxide emissions was inevitable—and that his industry should have a seat at the negotiating table. Though his peers were opposed to any government action, cap and trade looked to him like a smart and creative compromise that would enable utilities to modernize their plants and meet aggressive emissions targets without sending electricity prices skyrocketing. </P><P>In 1990 Rogers testified before Congress in support of cap and trade, which was established by the Clean Air Act Amendments that year. A relatively high number of allowances gave PSI time to make a deliberate and <mark>sustainable</mark> transition to cleaner generation. Within three years the company’s market capitalization had increased by more than 65%, while its price to customers had dropped. By 1995 its sulfur dioxide emissions were down by 30%.</P><P>PSI acquired a national reputation; it merged with Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric to create Cinergy, which in 2006 merged with <mark>Duke Energy</mark>. Together with 21 other companies and five leading environmental organizations, Duke created the U.S. <mark>Climate</mark> Action Partnership to lobby for strong federal legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article article-first-row premium""><P><STRONG>The Idea: </STRONG><EM>When James Rogers became CEO at then-ailing PSI (now <mark>Duke Energy</mark>), he was determined to listen to all its stakeholders. But environmentalists posed a particular challenge: The green movement had long viewed the energy industry with skepticism.</EM></P><P>“How can you advocate for a low <mark>carbon</mark> future when your company is among the largest emitters of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the United States?”</P><P>I’m asked this question a lot. It reminds me of a time about two decades ago, when I was 42 and in my second year as a CEO, trying to lead a utility back from the brink of bankruptcy. The effects of <A href=""http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/"" target=""-new"">acid rain</A> from burning coal had become clear. Much of our industry denied the facts and resisted any regulation of sulfur dioxide emissions. My company took a different path.</P><P>I believe that a price on <mark>carbon</mark> is inevitable, and utilities that take a long-term view will be part of the solution. Smart public policy can serve the interests of both business and society. It pays to be collaborative and build a consensus. But that isn’t easy.</P><H2>100 Days of Listening</H2><P>I wasn’t sure I had what it took to be a CEO when, in 1988, I interviewed for the job of leading Public Service Indiana, which had just written down a $2.7 billion loss on a half-constructed nuclear plant. PSI generated most of its electricity by burning coal in a number of aging plants in America’s heartland.</P><P>At the time, I didn’t consider myself an environmentalist. I was a lawyer with a background in energy, and I was looking for something with greater challenges and more responsibility. PSI, once a highly regarded utility with deep local ties, had plenty of challenges: Its finances were in disarray, morale was damaged, and leadership had lost the confidence of regulators, shareholders, and customers.</P><P>I spent a week preparing for my job interview with PSI’s board of directors and developed a plan I called “100 days of listening.” The idea was to meet with the company’s many stakeholders before taking action. That would help me to identify the issues, set priorities, figure out whom I could trust, and start repairing and rebuilding relationships. The other candidates had far more industry and leadership experience, but none of them came prepared with a plan. I was given the job.</P><P>All the members of my management team were much older than I was, and all of them advised me not to meet with any environmentalists. It was an emotional time for PSI’s veteran executives; their largest construction project had just been killed by the very groups I was planning to talk to. Internal opposition to my proposal was so strong that I considered changing course. But that felt like a cop-out: I had proposed a plan, and now I needed to execute it. Plus I was curious about the environmentalists’ point of view, and I believed in the power of collaboration to address tough problems. I decided to follow my instincts. 
 </P><P>My management team was not pleased. Some of its members thought I was naive. Had PSI not been on the verge of bankruptcy, its dividend suspended and emergency rates in effect, I might have faced a mutiny during my second week on the job. On a Saturday morning I drove 100 miles south to the Ohio River Valley, where our abandoned nuclear plant was located. There I sat down for coffee in a diner with leaders from the environmental groups that had blocked the plant. I started by telling them I was new to the job and wanted to better understand their point of view. Soon enough they were talking straight about their perspectives, as midwesterners tend to do.</P><P>I learned that their opposition was based on three beliefs: Nuclear energy was too costly, waste disposal was unmanageable, and the additional 2,360 megawatts of baseload generation capacity wasn’t needed. I disagreed with some of their positions, but I listened. The nuclear power they opposed would have replaced old coal plants with serious <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions, but that issue hadn’t yet surfaced. Today some of them are rethinking their stance on alternative sources of power as they confront <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><H2>Stake in the Ground</H2><P>I tried to create a collaborative environment internally as well as externally. I strongly believed that we needed a culture respectful of divergent views, in which problems could be identified early and unconventional solutions could be found.</P><P>The 100 days gave me time to learn the business and the personal dynamics. Then I prioritized my tasks. Near the top of my list was one that had arisen in a meeting with a state senator who chaired the environmental committee: PSI needed to integrate environmental risks into its decision making. Failure to do so had nearly caused the company to break down. Prior management hadn’t seen the risks from environmental opposition as legitimate until it was too late. </P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P>Beginning with “100 days of listening” gave me time to learn the business and the personal dynamics.</P></DIV></DIV><P>I proposed that we study the corporate environmental charters of other utilities and then create one for PSI. To my surprise, we found not one utility with a board adopted public statement about environmental considerations in its decision making. We decided to write a charter by convening our diverse stakeholders: customers, investors, state government officials, consumer advocates, employees, and environmentalists. Some members of my team worried that dialogue would further empower groups that opposed us and would evolve into a negotiation. They were right—but that was part of the reason for doing it. We wanted a charter that established enough common ground that we would never again waste billions of dollars on half-constructing a plant.</P><P>We held meetings with about two dozen leaders from different stakeholder groups. Each meeting began with an acknowledgment of our objective: to provide clean, affordable, and reliable electricity to our 575,000 customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Everyone agreed with this mission, but environmentalists focused on “clean,” consumer advocates stressed “affordable,” and factory owners put a premium on “reliable.” Nevertheless, the framework gave everyone in the room insight into the practical trade-offs involved in providing universal access to electricity. Using that framework, we negotiated a 10-point corporate charter.

We printed it in our annual report, and I hung a copy above my desk. We had planted a stake. Now we needed to follow our words with actions.</P><H2>The First Cap and Trade</H2><P>Acid rain became more prominent in the public debate in 1989, after the findings of a 10-year federal government study on the effects of sulfur dioxide emissions were released. I spent two months consulting various experts on the issue, and met with members of Congress in Washington. I concluded that legislation to curb SO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions was inevitable. The practical questions were: What would that legislation look like? What impact would it have on customers in Indiana and the 22 other states that generated more than 50% of their electricity from coal? 
 </P><P>President George H.W. Bush soon began championing an innovative market-based solution called cap and trade. Instead of the <A href=""http://www.epa.gov/"" target=""-new"">Environmental Protection Agency</A>’s traditional command-and-control approach, Bush—in collaboration with the Environmental Defense Fund and other groups—proposed a declining cap on SO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions. The cap would be combined with an emissions-trading mechanism and a declining allocation of free allowances to spur <mark>innovation</mark> and create a market for new low-cost solutions.</P><P>Cap and trade was a smart and creative compromise. It departed from uniform regulations that failed to consider the generating portfolios and geography of individual utilities. It generously allocated allowances to utilities in coal-dependent states in the early years and provided incentives to open low-sulfur coal mines. Most important, it enabled utilities to modernize their plants and meet aggressive emissions targets without sending electricity prices skyrocketing.</P><P>I assumed that my industry peers took a similar view of this idea. However, most executives at the 1989 annual meeting of our trade association, the <A href=""http://www.eei.org/Pages/default.aspx"" target=""-new"">Edison Electric Institute</A>, were opposed to government action. The CEOs of the largest utilities took the hardest line. They disputed the science. They argued that the health hazards hadn’t been proved and that the technology to reduce emissions was too expensive. Most of them were dismissive when I spoke up to ask, “Isn’t there a way we can support this to our benefit? The technology is evolving, and it seems like we could do this.”</P><P>These power brokers saw PSI as a small player without influence and me as a young guy not yet aware of how the industry worked. But my belief deepened that some form of cap and trade would come about and that our stakeholders would benefit if we took a stand in front of the issue. After all, as a regulated utility, we earned a return on all our capital expenditures, including those for environmental compliance.</P><P>In the spring of 1990 I testified before Congress in support of market-based cap and trade. Some of my industry peers were upset by my action, but others began to acknowledge that the world was changing, and having a seat at the table could be helpful. It was certainly helpful for PSI. The <A href=""http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/overview.txt"" target=""-new"">Clean Air Act Amendments</A> established cap and trade that year, and PSI and other coal-dependent utilities were allocated a relatively high number of allowances, which gave us time to make a deliberate and <mark>sustainable</mark> transition to cleaner generation.</P><P>The results spoke for themselves. From 1990 to 1993 our market capitalization increased by more than 65%, from $900 million to $1.5 billion. Significantly, this increase in shareholder value did not come at the expense of our customers. In fact, we lowered our real price of electricity in Indiana from 6.2 cents to 5.87 cents per kilowatt hour. Our rates were among the most affordable in the country. By 1995 we had also reduced our SO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions by 30%. </P><P>Our ties to local communities strengthened as PSI developed more of a national reputation. That helped us grow and attract new talent to the company. In 1994 we merged with Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric, effectively doubling our size and extending our service territory into Ohio and Kentucky. Among my first actions as CEO of Cinergy—the new company—was to create an updated environmental charter, which was adopted at the first meeting of the board. 
 </P><P>Fast-forward a decade to the issue of global <mark>climate change</mark>. Here, too, we were early advocates for action. As we investigated the science connecting <mark>carbon</mark> emissions to the rise of the earth’s temperature, I remembered the days of the acid rain debates. I heard similar voices of resistance and denial among my peers at industry meetings. But this time we were a major player in the room. In 2006 Cinergy merged with <mark>Duke Energy</mark>, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, and I was named chairman, president, and CEO.</P><H2>The Tide of a Low-<mark>Carbon</mark> Future</H2><P>“There is a tide in the affairs of men,” Shakespeare wrote. After a deeper investigation into <mark>climate change</mark>, it became clear to me that the science was sound: Burning fossil fuels contributes to global warming. As an industry, we needed to figure out how to operate in a <mark>carbon</mark>-constrained world. As a company, we needed to understand the issue, stay ahead of it, and help shape a <mark>sustainable</mark> solution. And, just as when I was the new CEO of PSI, we needed to build a diverse coalition of stakeholders who could collaborate, negotiate, and proactively face the challenge.</P><P>In July 2006, thanks in large part to the leadership of General Electric and the <A href=""http://www.wri.org/"" target=""-new"">World Resources Institute</A>, a first-of-its-kind coalition of 22 companies (16 of them on the <EM>Fortune </EM>500) and five leading environmental organizations created the <A href=""http://www.us-cap.org/"" target=""-new"">U.S. <mark>Climate</mark> Action Partnership</A>. The purpose of USCAP was to urge the federal government to enact strong legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As soon as USCAP was launched, critics tried to discredit it. A few people even called on me to resign as chairman of the Edison Electric Institute.</P><P>Those reactions weren’t surprising. We knew we were taking a risk, and we had anticipated resistance. A key moment occurred at an EEI board meeting in January 2007, shortly before USCAP issued its first public call to action. I proposed that we go around the room and let each CEO express his or her views. Some of those from small and midsize utilities spoke forcefully about our need as an industry to deal with the realities of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. Surprisingly, no one openly disagreed. Even the most skeptical CEOs acknowledged that if we didn’t have a seat at the table, we would be on the menu. We left that important meeting with an industry consensus: The way we produced and consumed electricity was not <mark>sustainable</mark>, and we needed a set of principles to guide our support for legislation establishing a price on <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><H2>Cap and Trade, the Sequel?</H2><P>Over the past four years USCAP and EEI have advocated for a comprehensive cap and trade policy for <mark>carbon</mark>. They have helped give the business community a voice in the discussion about how to responsibly transition to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> future. Recently, however, our efforts have suffered a setback owing to political gridlock and misunderstandings. This is unfortunate, because the longer we wait as a nation, the more difficult it will be for the U.S. to remain competitive in the new energy economy. We need bipartisan solutions, because regulatory uncertainty complicates business decision making. This is especially true for utilities, whose investment decisions are based on time horizons of 20 to 60 years.</P><P>Regardless of what happens in Washington, the fact is that we have been living on borrowed time in the U.S. electricity markets. The real price of electricity remained flat for more than five decades in much of the country, largely because we didn’t replace our aging power plants. Many of them were built in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s; as they are retired and replaced, the price of electricity will increase substantially. </P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P>We have been living on borrowed time in the U.S. electricity markets.</P></DIV></DIV><P>Absent a constructive national energy policy, we must continue to innovate and integrate new technology that will help us generate cleaner, more <mark>sustainable</mark> electricity. Once again, we find ourselves collaborating with groups that some may consider controversial. For example, we’ve formed partnerships with a number of leading energy companies in China to share best practices and learn from the Chinese as they bring new energy technologies to scale. My bet is that technology developed from unique collaborations will bring us to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> future faster than national or worldwide policy can. But we still need smart government action. We still need a road map, for the sake of business, society, and the environment.</P><P>So when I’m on the road these days speaking about our vision, and I’m asked that question: “How can you advocate for a low-<mark>carbon</mark> future…?” my answer begins with four words: “How can we not?”

Rick Scott has a new enemy on the campaign trail: Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer. And Steyer has started bringing his message and massive checkbook to the airwaves.</P><P>In an Aug. 8, 2014, commercial from Steyer’s political action committee NextGen <mark>Climate</mark>, the group accused the Republican incumbent of letting utility company <mark>Duke Energy</mark> run wild on the state’s citizens. <A href=""http://youtu.be/1T_22ZomXL4"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><U>The ad</U></A> references the botched upgrade at the now-shuttered Crystal River nuclear plant and canceled Levy County nuclear project.</P><P>&quot;We Floridians are paying billions to the nation's largest power company and getting nothing in return,&quot; says a TV reporter. Then the narrator: &quot;One defective power plant. Another never built. Florida fleeced by <mark>Duke Energy</mark>. Rick Scott knew, but he’s letting Duke keep collecting billions anyway.&quot;</P><P>The ad flashes a statement attributed to the <EM>Tampa Bay Times:</EM>&quot;Duke’s customers on the hook for up to $3.2 billion.&quot; It also says Scott received $500,000 in campaign contributions from Duke and its pre-merger counterpart, Progress Energy, strongly implying a connection.</P><P>The commercial was one of two NextGen <mark>Climate</mark> ads released attacking Scott. The other accused Scott of accepting campaign contributions from a Texas company performing unauthorized oil drilling in Collier County. We looked at that one in a separate item.</P><P>It’s obvious Scott heard of the troubles in Citrus and Levy counties, since it was a major headache for the 1.7 million Florida residents billed by <mark>Duke Energy</mark> for electricity (the company said it doesn’t comment on political ads). But we wondered, is there something Scott could have done to prevent the utility from pulling in billions for the troubled projects, even though no customer is benefitting from them? PolitiFact Florida decided to check the fine print.</P><P><STRONG>The nuclear option </STRONG></P><P>The saga of <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s ill-fated nuclear plants on Florida’s west coast is complex, making it hard to comprehensively explain its ups and downs. (The <EM>Tampa Bay Times</EM> has <A href=""http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/nuclear-plants.page"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><U>extensively covered</U></A> the morass.) We will give you a quick overview, though: In 2006, the state Legislature overwhelmingly passed <A href=""http://archive.flsenate.gov/data/session/2006/Senate/bills/billtext/pdf/s0888c1.pdf"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><U>SB 888</U></A>, allowing utilities to charge a so-called &quot;advance fee&quot; to customers in order to pay for nuclear projects.</P><P>The fee was based on the number of kilowatt hours the customers used, and shifted the expense of new nuclear projects to customers instead of shareholders. Unfortunately, while the bill allowed utilities to collect the fee for facilities yet to be built, there was no language included to ensure those companies had to actually build anything.</P><P>That same year, Progress Energy began selecting a site in Levy County for a new nuclear power plant. Over the years, the potential cost of the project neared $25 billion, and Progress collected roughly $1 billion in advance fees to help pay for it.</P><P>In 2009, Progress Energy was also upgrading its Crystal River nuclear plant by installing new steam generators. Progress elected to perform the upgrade itself and the reactor containment dome contracted during the project, requiring extensive repairs. Progress planned to reopen the plant in 2011, but the company committed one mistake after another in the work. Estimates to repair the building reached as high as $3.4 billion.</P><P>Progress merged with <mark>Duke Energy</mark> in 2012. State lawmakers changed their tune about the advance fee in 2013 amending the 2006 law with <A href=""http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2013/1472/?Tab=BillHistory"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><U>SB 1472</U></A>, saying a utility has 10 years after it gets its federal license to begin construction or lose access to the fees. The projects also had to be &quot;reasonable,&quot; an important addition, considering the Levy project had turned into the most expensive nuclear power plant in U.S. history.</P><P>The same day lawmakers passed the amendment by a wide margin, the Florida Supreme Court rejected an environmental group’s challenge to the fee, saying the 2006 fee was constitutional and the state’s <A href=""http://www.psc.state.fl.us/"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><U>Public Service Commission</U></A> had a framework with which to apply it.</P><P>Duke then decided in 2013 to shut down the Crystal River plant rather than fix it, even after using $265 million in advance fee money. The total cost of the Crystal River project grew to about $1.7 billion from repair work, having to buy electricity for customers elsewhere and other expenses. The company also canceled the Levy County project after spending $1.5 billion on it.</P><P>Duke continued to clamor for more advance fee cash, saying it may one day continue the Levy County project or build a natural gas plant. They also claimed decommissioning the Crystal River facility would take 60 years and cost another $1.18 billion, much of which the utility collected for its federally required decommissioning fund.</P><P>The five-member Public Service Commission voted 4-1 in October 2013 to settle with <mark>Duke Energy</mark> over $5 billion in costs for the two doomed projects. Customers would shoulder $3.2 billion in expenses, insurance would pay $835 million and shareholders would pay the rest, with Duke keepingabout $250 million ($150 million for Levy, $100 million for Crystal River).</P><P>Customers will have to pay monthly charges of $3.45 per 1,000 kilowatt hours for Levy through the early part of 2016 and $2.17 for Crystal River through at least 2017 -- all for two projects that never produced any electricity in exchange for the money paid.</P><P><STRONG>Who’s to blame?</STRONG></P><P>The commission’s members are appointed by the governor, who relies on the Legislature to <A href=""http://www.leg.state.fl.us/cgi-bin/View_Page.pl?File=index.cfm&amp;Directory=committees/joint/pscnc/&amp;CFID=20208396&amp;CFTOKEN=83243970"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><U>draft a list of nominees</U></A> when members’ four-year terms are up. Of the five veteran members on the board under Scott, four were previously chosen by Gov. Charlie Crist, and one was originally picked by Gov. Jeb Bush. Scott reappointed each, and the Legislature confirmed them.</P><P>&quot;Like judges appointed by the governor to the judiciary, PSC commissioners make independent decisions based on the established evidentiary record for each case,&quot; spokesperson Cindy Muir said. &quot;PSC decisions are not reviewed by the Legislature or the governor.&quot;</P><P>Scott did have some say on who served on the commission, however, although he has not spoken publicly about the two nuclear plants or the PSC’s vote. Scott could have urged lawmakers to deal with the advance fee, but no action was taken until 2013.</P><P>Many lawmakers were still not pleased with the commission’s settlement. Rep. Dwight Dudley, D-St. Petersburg, called the 2013 changes to the fee &quot;total eyewash&quot; and several legislators demanded a complete repeal of the advance fee. That hasn’t happened.</P><P>A change in the law is the only way consumers could avoid the advance fee, and that’s not up to the PSC or the governor alone, according to Public Counsel J.R. Kelly.</P><P>&quot;Whether the governor likes it or not and, to a certain extent, whether the PSC likes it or not, they have to follow the law,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;I don’t know what the governor’s office or anyone else could have done.&quot;</P><P>He pointed out that whether or not the governor and the commissioners share opinions on subjects, the PSC’s board members are appointed to four-year terms in order to avoid political reprisals after making unpopular decisions. Commissioners can only be removed for malfeasance, he said.</P><P><STRONG>Our ruling</STRONG></P><P>NextGen <mark>Climate</mark> said Scott &quot;is letting Duke (Energy) keep collecting billions&quot; after the utility company took in billions for two failed nuclear projects.</P><P>The $3.2 billion settlement was the decision of the Public Service Commission, however, and not the governor or the Legislature. Scott and lawmakers have a say in who serves as commissioners, but the board’s decisions in utility matters is final.</P><P>Scott could have asked for a change in the advance fee from 2006 that led to the flap, but he didn’t. He also could have appointed commissioners who may have voted differently. Beyond that, there’s not much the governor could do about the settlement the PSC awarded Duke. But it’s not like Scott has spoken up on the issue. If anything, he has been notably silent.</P><P>We rate the statement Half True.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN><ASIDE class=""aside""><DIV class=""pfad widget""><DIV class=""pfad__caption"">Advertisement</DIV></DIV></ASIDE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

corporations are responding to the crisis, less is mentioned about how power generation companies can affect change further upstream.</P><P><mark>Duke Energy</mark>, a corporation founded in the early 1900’s to provide hydro-electric power to southern states in the US, has grown into one of the largest electric power holding companies within the United States [3].  With greater than $ 121 billion in total assets, <mark>Duke Energy</mark> is responsible for lighting the homes and business of nearly 7.4 million customers throughout the American Southeast and Midwest.  Add on holdings in various Latin American countries, and this Fortune 250 corporation is positioned to have significant impacts in the push for increased sustainability.</P><P><STRONG><U>How is the organization likely to be affected and the steps they are taking: </U></STRONG></P><P><STRONG><U> </U></STRONG></P><P>To adequately address this topic, it is helpful to examine the sources from which the company derives their energy.  Traditionally US power generation derives from 4 main sources with coal and natural gas each comprising approximately 33% of the supply curve [2].</P><P><mark>Duke Energy</mark> falls into roughly the same distribution with an additional focus on utilizing its production capacity in nuclear energy [4]:</P><P>Where the company falls short is in their lack of renewable sources.  In fact, in the company’s <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project report, <mark>Duke Energy</mark> cites that the company will be most affected by:</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Regulation</STRONG></LI></UL><P>Duke explicitly notes that, in the face of statewide legislation mandating an increased percentage of electricity be generated from renewable sources, the company has been forced to increase utilization of their existing infrastructure.  This infrastructure in renewables, though has not been enough and has prompted large capital expenditures to further develop the company’s capabilities [1].  <mark>Duke Energy</mark> notes that “through acquisitions and development projects, by 2015 <mark>Duke Energy</mark> had over 2,500 MW of combined wind and solar capacity on line with the goal of increasing this to 8,000 MW by 2020 [1].”  Similar Clean Power initiatives limiting <mark>CO2</mark> emissions have led the company to undertake large scale decommissioning projects of their coal burning plants, and to develop new biomass scrubbing technology in an attempt to offset their <mark>CO2</mark> production.</P><P> </P><UL><LI><STRONG><mark>Climate</mark>-related developments </STRONG></LI></UL><P>Occurring in tandem with legislation are changes in consumer behavior surrounding <mark>climate</mark>-change.  With the development of electric vehicle technology, consumers are demanding more of <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s products and services—this increased demand creates a friction between the desire to use less energy and the need to supply “clean energy” to the user.  Even with this friction, though, “widespread adoption of electric vehicles will cut emissions (even in regions where most electricity is produced by coal), by 25-30% over conventional vehicles [1].”  Such changes in consumer preferences have prompted <mark>Duke Energy</mark> to create an internal group dedicated to overseeing and even encouraging consumer adoption of electric vehicles.</P><P><STRONG><U>Additional Steps:</U></STRONG></P><P>These pressures listed above, in conjunction with stated overarching corporate goals to deliver low cost clean energy, have prompted <mark>Duke Energy</mark> to pursue many avenues to achieve their 2020 goals of increasing renewably provided energy to the 8000 MW level, but are these steps enough?</P><P>With <mark>sustainable</mark> change occurring through acquisitions and capital investments into costly infrastructure <mark>Duke Energy</mark> finds themselves in a unique situation.  While they tout their current programs, citing that “as of January 5, 2016, <mark>Duke Energy</mark> had a Bloomberg ESG Disclosure Score of 50.2, the third-highest score, in the top quartile, among our peer U.S. utilities in the Bloomberg listing [4], many watch dog institutes believe the corporation is not doing nearly enough.</P><P> </P><P>If <mark>Duke Energy</mark> is going to continue to be a leader within the electricity space, they must continue to push their development of alternative energy sources.  Though acquisitions are a sure way of quickly amassing renewable energy sources, they do little to change the culture of the corporation for long term survival.  In order to put in place <mark>sustainable</mark> change, <mark>Duke Energy</mark> must:</P><UL><LI>Continue to invest in nuclear energy—improved safety standards and reliability make this an attractive avenue for <mark>Duke Energy</mark> to pursue. Such investments allow for greatly expanded capacity while affecting a culture change within the corporation.</LI><LI>Increase the decommissioning of coal plants—<mark>Duke Energy</mark> must create internal pressures for themselves to seek new energy sources.</LI><LI>Work with consumers to use less power—while optimization programs are currently in place, working to iterate on these programs will allow <mark>Duke Energy</mark> to charge a premium while still lowering overall costs to the individual consumer.</LI></UL><P> </P><P>Only time will tell if Duke is able to “keep its lights on,” but in the face of increasing governmental and societal pressures for improved sustainability, <mark>Duke Energy</mark> will have to find a way to (cleanly) light the path forward or go up in smoke.</P><P>[794 words]</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

(More on this jobs claim, and where it actually comes from, below).</P><P>Yost’s bio line at the end of the op-ed merely reads: “Steve Yost is president of the <SPAN class=""caps"">N.C.</SPAN> Economic Development Association.”</P><P>However, readers of the op-ed in the <EM>News <SPAN class=""amp"">&amp;</SPAN> Observer</EM> — the paper of Raleigh, North Carolina’s second largest city — wouldn’t know that Yost makes his bread and butter advancing the interests of <mark>Duke Energy</mark>, the Charlotte-based fossil fuel corporate <A href=""https://www.forbes.com/companies/duke-energy/"">giant</A> that has a 47 percent stake in the Atlantic Coast pipeline.</P><P>One of the <SPAN class=""caps"">N.C.</SPAN> Economic Development Association's (<SPAN class=""caps"">NCEDA</SPAN>) <A href=""https://www.nceda.org/sponsorship/current-sponsors/"">sponsors</A> and funders is <mark>Duke Energy</mark>. The <SPAN class=""caps"">NCEDA</SPAN> site states that its sponsors’ “support” helps them to “educate economic development professionals and provide advocacy for important legislative issues that affect North Carolina’s economy.”</P><P><mark>Duke Energy</mark> is also the top sponsor of <SPAN class=""caps"">NCEDA</SPAN>’s upcoming October 2017 fall conference. The <A href=""https://nceda.growthzoneapp.com/ap/Events/Register/nLvn6mLk?sourceTypeId=Hub"">webpage</A> for the conference reads: “<SPAN class=""caps"">NCEDA</SPAN> 2017 Fall Conference, presented by Duke Energy.”</P><P>John Nelms, Senior Economic Manager of <mark>Duke Energy</mark>, also sits on the <SPAN class=""caps"">NCEDA</SPAN> <A href=""https://www.nceda.org/about/board/"">board</A>.</P><P>Yost also doesn’t disclose in the op-ed that he is <A href=""http://www.ncse.org/about-us/our-team/steve-yost"">president</A> of North Carolina’s Southeast (<SPAN class=""caps"">NCS</SPAN>), which describes itself as “a regional public-private partnership that markets the southeast region, nationally and globally to encourage new economic growth.”</P><P>Duke is a funder of <SPAN class=""caps"">NCS</SPAN> — it is <A href=""http://files.www.ncse.org/news-and-reports/publications/Annual_Report_digital_version.pdf"">listed</A> in the 2015-2016 <SPAN class=""caps"">NCS</SPAN> catalogue as one of its “private partners” that gives “sustained financial support.”</P><P>John Nelms of Duke also <A href=""http://www.ncse.org/about-us/board-of-directors"">sits</A> on the <SPAN class=""caps"">NCS</SPAN> board.

Yost’s <SPAN class=""caps"">NCS</SPAN> was a <A href=""http://files.www.ncse.org/about-us/ncse-overview/NCSE_Overview_brochure_3.23.17.pdf"">sponsor</A> of a 2016 “<mark>Duke Energy</mark> Economic Development Session,” which Yost spoke at.</P><P><SPAN style=""font-size:11px;""><EM>See the ties between Steve Yost and <mark>Duke Energy</mark> mapped out at <A href=""https://littlesis.org/maps/2497-acp-advocate-funded-by-duke-energy"">LittleSis.org</A></EM></SPAN></P><P>Thursday’s <EM>News <SPAN class=""amp"">&amp;</SPAN> Observer</EM> op-ed isn’t the first time Yost has pushed for the Atlantic Coast pipeline in the press while not disclosing that he is funded by Duke. A March 2016 <A href=""http://www.robesonian.com/opinion/85773/atlantic-coast-pipeline-promises-more-jobs-cleaner-energy"">letter</A> to the editor, for example, strongly advocated for the Duke-backed pipeline.</P><P>Yost’s close ties to <mark>Duke Energy</mark> and the Atlantic Coast pipeline also helps explain his unsourced claim that the pipeline will create 4,400 jobs in North Carolina. The number, in fact, comes from <SPAN class=""caps"">PR</SPAN> material <A href=""https://www.dom.com/library/domcom/pdfs/gas-transmission/atlantic-coast-pipeline/acp-economic-benefits-nc.pdf"">promoted</A> and paid for by Dominion Energy, who has a 48 percent stake in the pipeline. The jobs number is also being <A href=""https://energycitizens.org/new-natural-gas-pipeline-could-support-upward-of-4400-north-carolina-jobs-2/"">pushed</A> by an astroturf front group that is funded by the American Petroleum Institute.</P><P>The battle over the Atlantic Coast pipeline is heating up in North Carolina after the state’s Department of Environmental Quality recently decided to <A href=""https://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/the-nc-deq-delays-making-a-decision-on-the-atlantic-coast-pipeline/Content?oid=8170497"">delay</A> its ruling on a water permit for the pipeline, requesting “more site-specific detail to ensure that downstream water quality is protected.” Meanwhile, opponents have been <A href=""https://www.indyweek.com/news/archives/2017/09/13/nc-<mark>climate</mark>-activists-hold-prayer-vigil-and-fast-in-opposition-to-the-atlantic-coast-pipeline"">stepping up</A> their protests against the pipeline.</P><P>As North Carolinians read the arguments of people like Steve Yost who support the pipeline, they should know that Yost and his organization are funded by <mark>Duke Energy</mark>, which is set to profit off of the pipeline.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It has dropped more than 60 companies after recommendations from the council, most recently oil explorers Cairn Energy Plc and Kosmos Energy Ltd. amid concerns over their activities in Western Sahara.</P><P>The fund also started excluding some coal producers and coal-consuming utilities this year, dumping more than 50 companies earlier this year and announcing more exclusions to come based on those criteria.</P><P>The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality said in a <A itemscope=""itemscope"" itemprop=""StoryLink"" href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-18/duke-told-to-close-coal-ash-ponds-by-north-carolina-regulators"" title=""Duke Told to Clean-Up Coal Ash <mark>Pollution</mark> by North Carolina (1)"" target=""_blank"">proposal</A> in May that Duke must dig up and close coal-ash pits at eight sites by 2019 and at 25 locations by 2024.

Duke will also include links to information on various scenarios used in its planning process, including variations in <mark>carbon</mark> costs and the adoption of energy efficiency measures. </P><P>Long-term investors are interested in this information because of the growing recognition that solar power and energy storage technologies could be disruptive to utilities like Duke. Utilities that are proactive will limit their downside exposure to disruptive technologies and may even stand to benefit from changes in the industry. Those that aren’t may be left behind. <U>Navigant</U>  <U>Research</U>, for instance, recently warned that, “Energy providers that fail to adapt to new technologies may find their customer base migrating to alternative solutions.” </P><P>As You Sow, Pax World Management LLC, and Praxis Mutual Funds joined the Foundation in filing the proposal. The proponents of the proposal view the commitments as a step in the right direction for Duke. Though questions remain about the Company’s construction of long-lived natural gas plants in the post-COP 21 era, the expanded reporting should help investors and other concerned stakeholders to get a better handle on the company’s plans for addressing the risks and opportunities its business faces as a result of <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>“As long-term investors, we appreciate <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s willingness to spend time speaking with us about the issues raised in our proposal. Our conversations with the Company were really constructive and resulted in a positive step forward for which <mark>Duke Energy</mark> should be congratulated,” said Laura Campos, director of shareholder activities at the Nathan Cummings Foundation. “We’re looking forward to continuing our conversation with the Company once the new reporting is released.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

SPECIAL SERIES
</H1><SECTION><P>E&amp;E examines a state in political turmoil.</P></SECTION></ASIDE><P>The primary factor in modernizing utilities, he added, is &quot;regulators that are ready to change and believe we need to change, then you need the legislature -- and I don't really see that happening in North Carolina. North Carolina will be a follower, not a leader.&quot;</P><P>In addition to being a rare CEO openly preparing for <mark>climate change</mark>, Rogers is a well-known Obama supporter who brought the Democratic National Convention to Charlotte in 2012 -- a move that Rogers said was not politically motivated but instead aimed at boosting Charlotte's prominence on the world stage. But these days, Duke's formidable lobbying presence is tilting with North Carolina to the right -- and funding the same politicians whom Rogers blames for blocking <mark>climate</mark> action.</P><P>&quot;They have shifted their giving to more dominant Republicans on the state level, to the state Legislature and to the party committees that support General Assembly races. They have tilted now strongly to Republicans,&quot; said Bob Hall, executive director of Democracy North Carolina, a liberal government watchdog. &quot;They're giving to incumbents disproportionately, that's typically what they've done for years of whatever party.&quot;</P><P>In the latest election cycle, Duke spent more on conservative causes than in previous years. The company's top recipient of campaign contributions was the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which received $32,400 from individuals employed by Duke and $30,000 from Duke's political action committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Current Duke CEO Lynn Good, who declined a request for an interview, alone has donated $9,250 to Republican congressional and presidential candidates and $1,500 to now-retired Democratic Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota since 2005, according to a review of Federal Election Commission records.</P><P>Rogers, on the other hand, gave generously to Democrats in one of their most pivotal beachheads against a GOP Senate takeover in November. Rogers and his wife donated more than $10,000 in 2013 to incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) to aid her tough re-election campaign against state House Speaker Thom Tillis (R), according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</P><P>Further complicating the post-Rogers transition is the reality of coal ash -- not clean energy -- leaping to the top of the Tar Heel State's agenda this year. Duke's new CEO is playing defense after a 48-inch stormwater pipe broke in February under a Duke coal ash slurry dump in Eden, N.C., spilling 30,000 tons of waste into the Dan River.</P><P>&quot;The coal ash spill is still a big political event, a dominant political story, toxic for Duke,&quot; said Carter Wrenn, a veteran Raleigh-based GOP strategist who noted that many lawmakers are &quot;gun shy&quot; about being on Duke's side. &quot;The lobbyists are now in the position where there's public opinion pushing against them, where it wasn't before.&quot;</P><ASIDE id=""image_asset_layout_559"" class=""left span5 image_asset_layout""><P class=""caption"">Jim Rogers is now retired after a seven-year run as <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s CEO. Today, Rogers is calling the utility industry to embrace a cleaner, greener and more flexible future. <SPAN class=""credit"">Photo courtesy of <mark>Duke Energy</mark>.</SPAN></P></ASIDE><P>Jim Warren, executive director of the advocacy group NC WARN, said he sympathizes with Rogers' push for a greener future but adds that North Carolina, where Duke is still dominated by fossil fuels, has little to show for his efforts. Duke is currently 41 percent coal, 33 percent nuclear, 24 percent gas, and 2 percent hydropower and solar energy.</P><P>To be sure, Duke -- an energy behemoth made up of five utilities operating in the Carolinas, the Midwest and Florida -- has <A href=""http://www.duke-energy.com/environment/renewable-standards.asp"">invested</A> more than $3 billion since 2007 in its unregulated business to foster renewables and is seen as a key vehicle for solar development in the Tar Heel State while meeting North Carolina's renewables energy standard. Duke is also investing in efficiency and has hydroelectric plants producing more than 3,000 megawatts of power each year, not to mention renewable energy credits from out of state.</P><P>&quot;My best read is that [Rogers] may have believed a lot of what he said about going green, but he couldn't turn the Duke ship. That's the narrative I choose to believe,&quot; Warren said. &quot;Part of the tragedy is that in his home state, they haven't performed, they've done a massive 'greenwash' of their corporate image and pretended to support renewables without matching that with their current deeds in the present era, nor in their long-range&quot; integrated resource plans.</P><P>Kelly Martin, a senior campaign representative for Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign in North Carolina, agreed there hasn't been much change in the corporate vision.</P><P>&quot;Jim Rogers was clearly a very charismatic leader with a very different public style -- he was well-versed in <mark>climate</mark> and clean energy issues,&quot; Martin said. &quot;But at the end of the day, he and Good are both leaders of a company that's leaving behind a legacy of toxic coal ash, that's reliant on fossil fuels, and dragging its feet on renewable energy and efficiency.&quot;</P><H3>Grooming Good</H3><P>Rogers, 66, isn't shy about touting his accomplishments pushing for clean energy -- or the key role he played in grooming Good, a former accountant and utility auditor whom he's known for decades, to be Duke's first female chief executive.</P><P>He steps more carefully, however, when it comes to grading Good or her approach to renewables.</P><ASIDE id=""image_asset_layout_562"" class=""right span5 image_asset_layout""><P class=""caption"">Last year, Lynn Good took the helm of <mark>Duke Energy</mark>, the country’s largest utility, and has since been tackling the North Carolina coal ash spill and ongoing debates over net metering. <SPAN class=""credit"">Photo courtesy of <mark>Duke Energy</mark>.</SPAN></P></ASIDE><P>Rogers' resume includes the launch of <mark>Duke Energy</mark> Renewables; the shuttering of several old, dirty coal plants; and vocal support for federal <mark>climate</mark> legislation as far back as 2007. Today, Duke's renewable business is growing, including an announcement this month that the utility will build the largest solar project east of the Mississippi.</P><P>Rogers said he had an eye on Good -- and diversity -- near the end of his seven-year run as Duke's leader.</P><P>&quot;When I stepped down, I had six executive vice presidents reporting to me, and three were women. So one of my missions was also to develop a little diversity,&quot; Rogers said. &quot;If you think about the world today, more than 50 percent of the people graduating from college, law school, medical school, getting MBAs are women -- so the role of women in the future is going to be far different than it's been in the past.&quot;</P><P>&quot;You have to admit, the utility industry is a pretty white male [dominated industry],&quot; he said.</P><P>Good, 55, joined Cinergy Corp. in Cincinnati in 2003 after working as a partner for the accounting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche and holding various senior management roles at Arthur Andersen. She started at Cinergy as vice president of financial project strategy and was named vice president and controller later the same year, and vice president of finance and controller in January 2005.</P><P>Rogers said he boosted Good by moving her over to run Duke's commercial businesses, including 6,600 MW in the Midwest, operations abroad and the commercial renewables arm, where she served from 2007 to 2009. When the opportunity presented itself, Rogers said, he promoted her into the role of chief financial officer in the summer of 2009.</P><SECTION class=""ad medium""><P class=""label"">Advertisement</P></SECTION><P>&quot;She was very talented, she knew how to tell me no,&quot; Rogers said. &quot;I do listen to people but she had the ability to say no in a way you got 'I understand why you're telling me no.'&quot;</P><P>Good became Duke's president, CEO and vice chairwoman of the company's board of directors last summer. Before that, she served as the company's executive vice president and chief financial officer, led the controller's office, treasury, tax, risk management and insurance, as well as corporate strategy and development. She was also responsible for the information technology and supply chain functions.</P><P>Ultimately, Rogers said, it was Duke's decision for Good to lead.</P><P>&quot;At the end of the day, I didn't select her, the board selected her,&quot; he said.</P><P>Still, one industry watcher said &quot;the jury is still out&quot; on how Good will lead the company.</P><P>&quot;She had to deal with the coal [spill] right out the chute, it'll be a while before she defines her legacy,&quot; the source said. &quot;She also needs to come out from Rogers' shadow.&quot;</P><H3>Solar fight brewing</H3><P>In addition to the ongoing spill crisis in North Carolina, Good is facing a lesser controversy over Duke's approach to net metering and rooftop solar in North Carolina.</P><P>In January, Good <A href=""http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/01/22/3555934/duke-energy-ceo-lynn-good-talks.html"">told</A> reporters at a briefing that Duke would attempt to reduce &quot;how much North Carolina households are paid for generating electricity from solar panels.&quot;</P><P>In response, solar advocates like the Alliance for Solar Choice (TASC) have launched a <A href=""http://youtu.be/XM3FrBBhXoA"">campaign</A> accusing the company, reportedly a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council, of trying to kill rooftop solar to protect its monopoly, one dominated by coal- and gas-fired generation.</P><P>TASC has <A href=""http://cleantechnica.com/2014/01/30/tasc-open-letter-former-duke-energy-ceo-jim-rogers/"">called</A> on Rogers to step in and advise Good, who the group says &quot;lacks&quot; the former CEO's &quot;vision&quot; on renewables.</P><P>Greg Andeck, a senior clean energy manager in the Environmental Defense Fund's North Carolina regional office, said existing utility laws in the state bar competition and have stymied North Carolina's growth in solar. Andeck also said Duke's efforts to change net metering prices are making matters worse by injecting uncertainty into the market.</P><P>Duke spokesman Randy Wheeless said the company currently has 1,700 solar customers in North Carolina -- out of 3 million total -- including small businesses and homes that use net metering for rooftop solar systems.</P><P>Duke is primarily concerned about a pricing rule that allows owners of rooftop solar systems to sell surplus electricity they generate to Duke at 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. The utility has floated the idea of paying customers only the generating costs, between 5 and 7 cents -- and is crafting recommendations to float with state regulators by the year's end, Wheeless said.</P><P>&quot;It seems a little odd that we're paying so much more for rooftop solar than any other type of solar,&quot; Wheeless said. &quot;It's growing, I can't put a percentage or figure on it. But that's one reason we've been voicing this opinion, to get net metering rules correct now, as opposed to five years from now when we have 10,000 customer who have [net metering].&quot;</P><P>For his part, Rogers is careful to tread lightly about his new successor.</P><P>&quot;I think in the long term, they understand distributed generation will play a role,&quot; Rogers said. &quot;I think Duke understands that their role is going to change but the regulatory and business model have to change.&quot;</P><H3>'Kodak moment'</H3><P>Looking forward, Rogers said North Carolina needs to take <mark>climate change</mark> seriously; maintain its renewable portfolio standard; and embrace new technologies like storage, renewables and distributed generation.</P><P>&quot;When you see technologies evolving that challenge your business model, you need to embrace them. You don't want the utility industry to have a Kodak moment,&quot; Rogers said. &quot;You know, Kodak developed digital, but they couldn't move away from their traditional way because it was their core business. The utility industry should embrace distributed generation, they actually should invest in distributed generation and be a competitor with everyone else.&quot;</P><P>The message revolves around Rogers' view that almost every U.S. power plant -- other than hydro -- will be retired and replaced by 2050, leaving the country with &quot;a blank sheet of paper&quot; to work on. Planning gives the United States a chance to address <mark>climate change</mark> and design a more <mark>sustainable</mark> system, he said.</P><P>He warns that demand for electricity may be modest -- and that utilities may no longer be suppliers if they don't find a way to participate in building and operating distributed generation in the United States.</P><P>In addition to messaging, Rogers is busy writing a book about bringing electricity to 1.2 billion people in developing countries and collaborating with the Brookings Institution on workshops to discuss trends in the utility industry. He's also become a familiar face at utility and clean tech conferences, downplaying the doomsday projections about U.S. EPA's <mark>carbon</mark> rules and &quot;spiral of death&quot; associated with a distributed grid.</P><P>Industry watchers in North Carolina say Rogers' comments shed an interesting light on looming debates.</P><P>EDF's Andeck pointed to a 1960s-era law in North Carolina that bars electric competition in Duke's territory. He also pointed to a portion of North Carolina's General Statute, which he said hampers solar companies from entering into no-upfront-cost contracts and selling power to homeowners and businesses.</P><P>&quot;What's challenging in North Carolina compared to other states that allow competition is that we're losing out on being able to attract clean energy companies to our state because of these old laws,&quot; Andeck said, citing the success stories of Solar City, which now operates in 13 states and has added thousands of new employees since 2007.</P><P>Debates around net metering, competition, tax credits and other energy policies are likely to heat up in the North Carolina General Assembly's regular session next year, Andeck said.</P><P>&quot;It really is the question of what type of electricity infrastructure do we want to have, one dominated by one large utility or one in which customers have a wide range of choices for meeting their needs,&quot; he said.</P><P>Rogers is calling on policymakers to craft adaption plans to fight warming in North Carolina and nationwide.</P><P>&quot;How do we adapt to the droughts in the Southwest and the Colorado River? How do we address adaptation problems associated with receding shorelines in Florida? Or storms along the Atlantic?&quot; Rogers asked. &quot;I've come to believe that there's already been enough warming to create adaptation issues, and that my thought about turning to adaptation is not about ignoring mitigation, but the clear recognition that we're at a place where adaptation strategies are needed.&quot;</P><P>But again, Rogers acknowledges that change requires political will and finding common ground. And he doesn't see that in North Carolina. He pointed to a GOP measure to scale back the state's renewable portfolio standard introduced by state Rep. Mike Hager (R), a former Duke engineer.</P><P>&quot;I think we need to maintain renewable portfolio standards until the prices&quot; of new technologies fall further, Rogers said. &quot;I supported the passage of the RPS. And I see no reason at this juncture to change it. Five years from now, maybe. Ten years from now, maybe. But not now.&quot;</P><P>Although some green groups have questioned Rogers' legacy, Andeck said it's refreshing to hear an industry voice emphasize the need for a clean path forward.</P><P>&quot;What's exciting to hear are the voices of people that have been in the industry, like Rogers, that we can't continue with the status quo if we're going to enable clean energy businesses to succeed in the 21st century,&quot; he said.</P></SECTION></SECTION></ARTICLE></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

No rate hikes for Duke’s dirty energy,” read the banner activists dropped from the roof of the Buncombe County parking deck on College Street prior to a Sept. 27 N.C. Utilities Commission public hearing on the proposed rate increase. A lineup of 44 speakers echoed those sentiments over the course of a nearly four-hour hearing, one of five across the state before a Nov. 20 evidentiary hearing that will determine what energy customers will see on their bills come January.</P><P>In June, <mark>Duke Energy</mark> Progress filed a request with the Utilities Commission to raise rates an average of 14.9 percent. Residential customers would see an average increase of 16.7 percent, and commercial and industrial rates would go up an average of 13.5 percent. A typical 1,000-kilowatt monthly residential bill would increase from $104.68 to $122.48. As part of the new rates, the basic customer charge would jump from $11.13 to $19.50 for most residential customers.</P><P>If approved, the plan would affect DEP’s 1.3 million electric customers in the Asheville area and central and eastern North Carolina, and it would increase the company’s revenues by $477.5 million a year. Duke says it needs the added revenue to pay for new natural gas plants, coal ash basin closures and storm damage repair.</P><H2><STRONG>Cost of coal ash</STRONG></H2><P>Several speakers at the hearing took issue with Duke’s intention to make customers pay to clean up ash at its coal-fired power plants. Federal regulations require Duke to excavate and safely dispose of coal ash or to cap coal ash basins in place. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, coal ash contains contaminants such as mercury, cadmium and arsenic, which can pollute waterways, groundwater and the air.</P><P><STRONG>Hartwell Carson</STRONG>, French Broad riverkeeper at MountainTrue, said environmental groups, businesses and members of the public have long pointed out the dangers of storing coal ash in unlined pits, and it shouldn’t be their responsibility to foot the bill for such practices. “While we think Duke should clean up all of their coal ash, we shouldn’t pay for their fight against cleaning it up and we shouldn’t give <mark>Duke Energy</mark> a blank check for work they haven’t even completed,” he said.</P><P>The Sierra Club of Western North Carolina also opposes putting the entire burden of cost related to the cleanup of coal ash on customers, said <STRONG>Judy Mattox</STRONG>, the group’s chair. “Coal ash has resulted in contamination of lakes, rivers, drinking water,” she said. “North Carolina has paid a heavy price and now <mark>Duke Energy</mark> wants to bill us for their negligence and mismanagement. We say no.”</P><P>More than one commenter implored the Utilities Commission to not only deny Duke’s requested rate increase, but also to investigate the company’s practices. <STRONG>Cathy Scott</STRONG> said the more she looks at <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s plans for its business, the more she asks herself if the company knows what it’s doing. “The plan seems expensive, harmful, reckless with regard to their investors and risky in many ways to the rest of us,” she said. “We the people call for a Public Utilities-initiated investigation and audit into <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s long-term planning, calculations, analyses and data — in other words, into their business plan. Investigate and audit, please.”</P><DIV class=""entry-image""><FIGURE id=""attachment_682277"" data-src-large=""https://mountainx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_2927-1100x523.jpg"" class=""aligncenter"" style=""max-width:720px;""><FIGCAPTION>THE PEOPLE SPEAK: Judy Mattox of the Sierra Club of Western North Carolina expresses comments to members of the N.C.

Photo by Carolyn Morrisroe</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><H2><STRONG>Too costly for some </STRONG></H2><P>While all <mark>Duke Energy</mark> Progress customers would see higher rates if the Utilities Commission approves the request, low-income customers could be the hardest hit. In particular, the proposed 75 percent increase in the monthly fixed charge could have a negative impact, said <STRONG>Bill Whalen</STRONG>, a staff attorney with Pisgah Legal Services in Asheville. “This fee is regressive, shifting a greater share of burden proportionately to individual customers and thus particularly to low-income customers, who are already struggling to meet their basic needs, while benefiting those larger customers who use the most energy,” he said.</P><P>Whalen asserted that imposing a hefty base charge that doesn’t vary according to a customer’s electricity usage will be a disincentive to conservation. “Mandatory fees undercut the incentive to conserve energy and the ability of customers to save money and control their own budget by reducing their monthly use,” he said.</P><P>Asheville resident<STRONG> Jim McGlinn </STRONG>opposes the rate hike because it presents “a huge difficulty for those who live in poverty and those who are on a fixed income like myself.” According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 17.3 percent of Asheville residents live below the poverty line. McGlinn compared the plight of that population with <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s 2016 earnings of more than $2 billion and the $13.8 million total yearly compensation package for Lynn Good, the company’s CEO. “It is obvious that Duke does not need the money to survive, while the increased energy costs, in my opinion, might very well push homeowners over the edge into bankruptcy,” McGlinn said.</P><P>Residents on fixed incomes already take every step possible to bring their energy bills down, said <STRONG>Stephanie Biziewski</STRONG>, a retired Asheville resident who told of replacing an aging dehumidifier just to lower her bill by $17.85. She also pointed out that money she pays to Duke is money she won’t then be spending at local establishments. “Owners and employees of local businesses suffer without my patronage,” she said. “Duke’s proposed mandatory fixed-rate hike not only denies me my consumer rights, it also negatively impacts our local economy.”</P><H2><STRONG>Cost of ignoring the future</STRONG></H2><DIV class=""entry-image""><FIGURE id=""attachment_682280"" class=""alignleft"" style=""max-width:330px;""><FIGCAPTION>RALLY AT THE COURTHOUSE: Music, dance, drumming and demonstration fill the plaza before a public hearing gets underway. Photo by Carolyn Morrisroe</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><P>Why should customers pay for energy production technology that is becoming obsolete? That was a question posed by several members of the public who spoke at the hearing, wondering why they should invest in a company that they believe is not evolving with the times.</P><P><STRONG>Steve Carter</STRONG> said companies that have trouble adapting to change tend to go out of business — like the makers of buggy whips. He sees rapid growth in technologies to produce energy other than the burning of fossil fuels, such as solar and hydrogen fuel cells. Carter also thinks society should move toward more dispersed energy production, which would help prevent catastrophic power outages when the electric grid goes down in an event like a major hurricane.</P><P>“We now have the opportunity to move the generation from central points to much more local, which of course Duke wouldn’t like because they can’t charge for it if it’s being generated in your backyard, and reduce the possibility of environmental damage and the complete loss of electric power in storms by generating the power locally, by distributing it locally and removing these methods of distribution and production that are becoming obsolete in our time,” Carter said.</P><P>An energy future dominated by gas would hold North Carolina ratepayers hostage, <STRONG>Xavier Boatright </STRONG>said. “As the cost of renewables fall, pipelines and other gas infrastructure will quickly become useless, yet we the ratepayers will still have to pay Duke back for the money they invested, plus a hefty rate of return,” he said.</P><P>Beyond opining that Duke’s future plans are not financially sound, commenters raised the concern that its business model doesn’t take into account the health of future generations.</P><P><STRONG>James Smith</STRONG>, a student at UNC Asheville, said he felt compelled to speak on behalf of younger people who will inherit the legacy of fossil fuels. “It’s my generation that’s left with the results of these decisions, and that’s something that I want to make very clear to the commission,” he said. “This may sound like a moral tirade and <mark>climate</mark> rant, but this is something I fear for. I don’t want to bring children into this world if they can’t have their basic necessities met.” Smith said companies like <mark>Duke Energy</mark> are directly contributing to <mark>climate change</mark>, and supporting that means being complicit in “propagating the horrible storms that we are beginning to see.”</P><H2><STRONG>Calling on commissioners’ consciences</STRONG></H2><P>Some commenters made personal appeals to all six members and the chairman of the N.C. Utilities Commission, who were in attendance.</P><P><STRONG>Kendall Hale </STRONG>said she’s been speaking out about Duke rate increases for over 10 years and she wishes she didn’t have to anymore. “I’m terrified about the direction that the state and this country and the world is going. The more we burn fossil fuels, the faster we are going toward dangerous and more terrible storms that we have seen hit our country and our coasts and partly here in the western part of the state,” she said. “Your responsibility as commissioners is to defend the public interest. Your job is to defend the health and safety of the public. That means no more burning of fossil fuels from Duke.”</P><P>If Duke is going to ask ratepayers to fork over more funds, that money needs to be going to the public good, which would mean a shift to 100 percent renewables, said <STRONG>Jamie Friedrich. </STRONG>“If we’re going to connect ourselves with the real world, where actions have consequences, where life is more important than money, where the Earth is more important than profits for a few hyper-wealthy people while the rest of us choke on air we can’t breathe — no. I say no. … Anyone that has a conscience — no,” she said.</P><P><STRONG>Richard Fireman</STRONG>, founder of the Alliance for Energy Democracy, said society should pay attention to risk-based analysis of electricity generation in the context of <mark>climate change</mark>. “As the sea rises and the storms roll through our communities, it will be we the people who pay the price of property loss, public health costs and infrastructure loss while Duke gets away with profiteering from the economic and social catastrophe it caused by ignoring the risks associated with natural gas,” he said.</P><P><STRONG>Sam Mac Arthur</STRONG> said she is 70, single and self-employed and would rather use the $20 monthly utility rate increase to take herself out to a fine meal. She reminded the commissioners that they too are human beings who have children and grandchildren and that they must not ignore their principles. “Open your heart to your conscience, pay attention to your dreams tonight because your ancestors are knocking on your doors loud and clear, and they will be heard,” she said. “Water is life, because it’s sacred to us. It’s our first medicine. We can’t live without clean water and we can’t live without air, and both of those things have been compromised by the choices that you have made. I hope you choose differently.”</P><H2>Question about public access</H2><P>At the commencement of the hearing at 7 p.m., 85 to 100 people were present in the courtroom. <STRONG>Audrey Yatras</STRONG> said during her testimony that some people who wanted to speak at the hearing were not allowed in.  “The doors closed at the courthouse at 7 o’clock and most of the people that were outside — there was a large crowd of people outside who could not get in tonight, and I don’t know if anyone here was aware of that,” she said.</P><P>Asheville City Council member <STRONG>Julie Mayfield</STRONG> arrived after 7 p.m. and found the doors locked. She tells <EM>Xpress</EM> she texted <mark>Duke Energy</mark> representative <STRONG>Jason Walls</STRONG>, who helped her and another person waiting outside to get access to the chamber. “I do know [the doors] were still locked an hour later when a friend tried to get in and couldn’t. I don’t know why the doors were locked,” she says.</P><P><STRONG>David Drooz</STRONG>, chief counsel for the public staff of the N.C. Utilities Commission, told <EM>Xpress</EM> a member of the public approached him after the hearing, saying the doors were closed on the grounds that the hearing room had reached capacity. “I just heard this secondhand, and cannot confirm whether the doors were closed before everyone had a chance to enter, or whether the room had reached capacity,” he says. “I do not know if the police consulted with the commission or just closed doors on their own initiative.”</P><P><STRONG>Sam Watson</STRONG>, general counsel for the N.C. Utilities Commission, said the commission did not do anything to limit participation at the meeting. He directed inquiries to the officers providing security at the hearing. “We certainly didn’t ask them to keep anyone from coming in,” Watson says. “I spoke to the officer who seemed to be in charge, although I don’t recall his name, and he said that there was only one person who had tried to get in after 7 o’clock and they initially had turned them away and then let them in.”</P><P><EM>Xpress</EM> contacted the Buncombe County Sheriff’s Office regarding the matter, and its public relations coordinator, <STRONG>Natalie Bailey</STRONG> responded, “I am in receipt of your request; it will be processed in accordance with North Carolina General Statute 132,” referring to the statute governing public records requests.</P><P><STRONG>Danielle Peoples</STRONG> of <mark>Duke Energy</mark> told <EM>Xpress</EM>, “The hearing was scheduled and organized by the N.C. Utilities Commission, so that was not a decision made by Duke.”</P><P>Comments on the proposed <mark>Duke Energy</mark> Progress rate increase can be emailed to the N.C.

Rogers says that by 2030 they could make up as much as 12 percent of Duke’s energy supply, but they won’t be a big factor for another decade, because sunshine and wind are too irregular and the plants to harvest them are still too small. This year, Duke signed a 20-year deal to buy the entire electric output of the largest solar farm in the country, SunEdison’s plant in Davidson County, N.C. — it generates all of 16 megawatts, compared with 800 megawatts from a coal plant.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""998"" data-total-count=""18405"">He drew another wedge in the pie chart for coal: it will shrink from producing nearly two-thirds of Duke’s power to just over a quarter. Rogers predicts coal will never go away, because it’s cheap and more accessible than any other energy source. The technology to remove <mark>co2</mark> from the smokestacks and “sequester” it affordably is, he estimates, 10 to 15 years away. Duke is planning to build an experimental plant in Edwardsport, Ind., that will “gasify” coal, a tentative first step to capturing <mark>carbon</mark>. But Duke embarked on this venture only after securing a government subsidy of $460 million. Even if someone manages to make <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration feasible, Rogers worries that there’s a limit to what the public will tolerate. “We don’t know what happens if the <mark>carbon</mark> leaks back out of the ground, and we’ve never done it successfully on scale,” he told me. Later, he said, “So you’ll get the next version of Not in My Backyard — it’ll be Not Under My Backyard.”</P><DIV id=""story-ad-4"" class=""story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ""><DIV class=""accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden""><P>Advertisement</P></DIV><A class=""visually-hidden skip-to-text-link"" href=""#story-continues-6"">Continue reading the main story</A></DIV><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""311"" data-total-count=""18716"" id=""story-continues-6"">When Rogers finished, his pie chart was neatly divided into the various fuel options. This plurality is a key part of his vision: no single energy source will save us. None is so plentiful or without costs that it dominates the others. “There’s no silver bullet,” he concluded, “just silver buckshot.”</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""1186"" data-total-count=""19902"">Interestingly, the one green initiative Rogers says he hopes will emerge most quickly is focused not on generating power but on conserving it. Last year, he concocted the Save-a-Watt plan, which would let Duke profit from helping its customers drastically cut their energy use. Like roughly half the utilities in the United States, Duke is regulated; it can charge more for power only if it builds a new power plant and persuades the regulator to approve a rate increase to pay for it. But the fastest way to reduce a <mark>carbon</mark> footprint is by improving efficiency. Under Save-a-Watt, Duke would, for example, distribute “smart” meters that automatically turn off customers’ appliances during periods of peak power use. For its first experiment, Duke plans to cut the consumption of its customers in the Carolinas by 1,800 megawatts, which is equal to the output of two new coal-fired plants. The regulator would then let Duke charge higher rates for the electricity its customers do use to pay for all the efficiency technology. Save-a-Watt thus turns the power business on its head: rather than charge customers more to build plants, Duke will effectively charge them not to do so.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""550"" data-total-count=""20452"">“I would rather spend $8 billion implementing efficiency than spend $8 billion on building a nuclear plant,” Rogers told me. Nuclear power has enormous construction and political risks. Efficiency doesn’t. After Rogers spoke with Bill Clinton at a private retreat last year, the former president was so fired up that when he later went onstage at the annual Clinton Global Initiative conference he raved about Save-a-Watt, declaring it “a simple, brilliant idea. It has the capacity to fundamentally change what we do in the United States.”</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""266"" data-total-count=""20718""><B>As the Lieberman-Warner</B> bill took shape last spring and summer, Rogers   ought to have been feeling triumphant. Instead, he was increasingly uneasy with   what the senators were doing. He was particularly alarmed by the way they planned   to hand out <mark>co2</mark> allowances.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""1184"" data-total-count=""21902"">Among the many mind-numbing details in cap-and-trade politics, the allowances — permission to pollute, essentially — are the most charged. In the acid-rain trading market, the government freely gave the worst polluters the largest allowances, under the assumption that they faced the biggest challenges and needed the most financial help. But the Lieberman-Warner bill, like virtually every other cap-and-trade bill in the works, gives away only 75 percent of the allowances; the government auctions off the rest. Year by year, the percentage of allowances that will be auctioned off steadily rises, until nearly all of them are. In essence, with the stroke of a pen, the government creates a new and valuable form of property: <mark>carbon</mark> allowances. And for the government, we are talking about staggering amounts of money, the biggest new source of cash in years. <mark>Carbon</mark> allowances are projected to be worth $100 billion in the first year alone, rising to nearly $500 billion by 2050. To put that in context, an estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office predicts that the annual revenues from auctioning allowances will be equal to 15 percent of what the I.R.S. takes in.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""813"" data-total-count=""22715"">Rogers sees this as a financial disaster for Duke. By his calculations, Duke would spend at least $2 billion in the first year alone and have to raise its rates immediately by up to 40 percent to cover that. Worse, coal-fired utilities would not get the special treatment they did under the acid-rain legislation. This time around, a large number of allowances would be given away to nuclear and hydroelectric utilities that already produce very little <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. Those companies would not need their allowances and so could sell them for a healthy profit in coal-dependent states. The Lieberman-Warner rules, Rogers says, will effectively impose a “hidden tax” on those states — and they’re primarily the heartland states, where energy costs are already pinching industry and working-class families.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""712"" data-total-count=""23427"">What especially enrages him, though, is how the government wants to spend the cash it raises from the allowances. As Lieberman-Warner worked its way through the Senate environment committee, senators attached assorted riders: $800 billion over the life of the bill for tax refunds to help consumers pay for their higher electric bills, $1 billion for deficit reduction and billions more in handouts to state governments. In industry speeches, Rogers characterized the bill as a “bastardization” of cap-and-trade economics. (He later apologized.) In conversations with me, he expressed special disdain for Barbara Boxer, the California senator who shepherded the bill through the Senate environment committee.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""632"" data-total-count=""24059"">“Politicians have visions of sugarplums dancing in their head with all the money they can get from auctions,” Rogers told me last month. “It’s all about treating me as the tax collector and the government as the good guy. I’m the evil corporation that’s passing through the <mark>carbon</mark> tax so Senator Boxer can be the Santa Claus!” If the government was going to collect cash from <mark>carbon</mark> auctions, Rogers figured, at least it ought to invest that money in green-tech research. “A billion dollars for deficit reduction,” he vented. “A billion dollars! What is [Boxer] smoking? I thought we were solving <mark>carbon</mark> here.”</P><DIV id=""story-ad-5"" class=""story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ""><DIV class=""accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden""><P>Advertisement</P></DIV><A class=""visually-hidden skip-to-text-link"" href=""#story-continues-7"">Continue reading the main story</A></DIV><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""902"" data-total-count=""24961"" id=""story-continues-7"">For all of Rogers’s careful effort to position himself as a forward thinker — and an advocate for the Midwestern coal states — that did not gain him any slack. Congressional insiders who watched Rogers lobby the Senate committee say that regional politics actually worked against him. The Democratic deal makers who promised to deliver the votes for the bill were “a left-center coalition” of senators, most of whom come from urban and coastal states that do not rely heavily on coal. (Boxer, for example, hails from California, which gets only a small percentage of its energy from coal.) “And a lot of people, Jim Rogers in particular, really didn’t play in the negotiations,” says a Congressional aide close to the Lieberman-Warner negotiations who did not have approval to talk to the press. “The members on the Democratic side aren’t particularly responsive to his concerns.”</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""579"" data-total-count=""25540"">So by this spring, Rogers found himself in the curious position of fighting tooth-and-nail against a bill he spent years pushing for. It is entirely possible that Rogers is right, and that the auctioning of allowances will lead to economic shocks. Many economists worry about the price of allowances rising out of control. “Clean” technology might not emerge fast enough. Nuclear power could flounder. Desperate to move away from coal, utilities might switch to burning natural gas, driving up its price and thereby substantially inflating the cost of heating American homes.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""796"" data-total-count=""26336"">As Rogers went on the attack, critics countered that he sounded less like an environmental statesman and more like an old-school C.E.O. fighting for government pork, arguing baldly that what’s best for Duke is what’s best for the country — that cap-and-trade will only work if it’s set up in a way that best benefits Duke. John Rowe, the chief executive of Exelon — the country’s largest nuclear power company, which will profit handsomely by selling its allowances — argues that it’s only fair to hit Duke and others with higher costs. Customers in nuclear states have paid higher electric bills for years, because nuclear power is inherently more expensive to generate, Rowe points out. Duke could have switched to nuclear decades ago but didn’t, so now it must pay the price.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""265"" data-total-count=""26601"">“Duke’s customers had a big cost advantage for a very long time,” Rowe told me. “And our feeling is you’re not entitled to have that made virtually permanent.” And he added, “This is sausage making, but Lieberman-Warner makes a pretty good sausage.”</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""232"" data-total-count=""26833""><B>T</B>he truth, perhaps inevitably, is that as <mark>carbon</mark>-cap laws become closer   to reality, almost no one is happy. Coal-burning energy firms fear they’ll   be destroyed. Environmentalists worry that the energy lobby will gut the bills.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""496"" data-total-count=""27329"">This conflict was laid bare at Duke’s annual shareholders’ meeting in early May. Rogers started things off by devoting a full hour to his 40-year plan to de<mark>carbon</mark>ize Duke. But when it was time for the question period, a dozen environmentalists lined up at the microphones and took up another hour lambasting Rogers for his new coal plant, now being built in Cliffside, N.C. If Rogers was really committed to breaking away from <mark>co2</mark> emissions, why wasn’t he pouring the money into renewables?</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""458"" data-total-count=""27787"">“Business as usual for even another decade will be disastrous,” said Jim Warren, executive director of the North Carolina Waste Awareness and Reduction Network. A 25-year-old shareholder pleaded with Rogers to stop buying coal from mountaintop mines and foreswear nuclear energy. “What you invest in today, my generation has to pay for in the future,” she said. “Please do not steal from your grandchildren and leave us with a mess to deal with.”</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""468"" data-total-count=""28255"">But most of the shareholders, who numbered 250 or so, rolled their eyes as the environmentalists spoke; some openly heckled. “I would just like to caution our company not to get on this global-warming bandwagon,” one shareholder stood up to say. “I’ve read a lot of scientists, and there’s no agreement.” Rogers remained unwaveringly polite to the opposition, though — at several points shushing the hecklers, and thanking each speaker who laid into him.</P><DIV id=""story-ad-6"" class=""story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ""><DIV class=""accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden""><P>Advertisement</P></DIV><A class=""visually-hidden skip-to-text-link"" href=""#story-continues-8"">Continue reading the main story</A></DIV><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""714"" data-total-count=""28969"" id=""story-continues-8"">When I saw Rogers a few days after the event, he grimaced at the memory of it. He is annoyed by opposition to his new coal plant; he also seems genuinely puzzled that local environmentalists don’t see the big picture as he does, that they don’t trust his 40-year plan to slash Duke’s <mark>carbon</mark> output. He maintains that the new plant will partly replace two older coal-fired ones, and because it is much more efficient, it will produce 30 percent less <mark>co2</mark>. “Our overall <mark>carbon</mark> footprint is going to go down,” he insisted. His frustration is the flip side of his desire to talk endlessly to critics of coal; he says he believes he can persuade anyone, which is probably why he seems so alarmed when he fails.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""1025"" data-total-count=""29994"">Yet many local environmentalists no longer believe Rogers, and they have precisely the opposite view of how the future should unfold. They view the Lieberman-Warner bill not as too strong but as too weak. They point out, correctly, that Duke stands to reap tens of billions in free allowances, even under the existing bill, money that will subsidize the burning of coal. “This bill gives huge windfall profits to a company that buys a lot of coal, like Duke,” says Frank O’Donnell, the head of Clean Air Watch, an environmental group. “I happen to think that it’s immoral. In a sense, you’re paying the polluter. You’re rewarding the very companies that are the source of the problem.” He says he doesn’t believe that coal-dependent companies will move fast enough unless they feel the tighter pressure of even more aggressive <mark>carbon</mark> caps. Rogers is simply “greenwashing” his company, saying all the right things so he can wear the mantle of the revolutionary without having to make the hard sacrifices.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""264"" data-total-count=""30258"">Allegations like these perturb Rogers no end. Many protesters, he told me, are an “eco elite” who don’t understand the need working-class people have for affordable energy. But then, in another breath, he admits he also understands why they view him askance.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""376"" data-total-count=""30634"">“There’s an interesting contradiction in my position,” he said. “I’ve struggled with it. On the one hand, I want to smooth out the transition for the customers, because we’ve got low prices. But on the other hand, and this is sort of the awkwardness of it, the other truth is as prices go up, people’s behavior is modified.” Change needs to come, but how fast?</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""53"" data-total-count=""30687"">“That’s the art in this, and not the science.”</P><FOOTER class=""story-footer story-content""><DIV class=""story-meta""><DIV class=""story-notes""><P>Clive Thompson, a contributing writer for the magazine, writes frequently about technology.</P></DIV><P class=""story-print-citation"">A version of this article appears in print on , on Page MM26 of the <SPAN itemprop=""printEdition"">Sunday Magazine</SPAN> with the headline: A Green Coal Baron?. <SPAN class=""story-footer-links""><SPAN><A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Today's Paper</A><SPAN class=""pipe"">|</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp839RF.html?campaignId=48JQY"" target=""_blank"">Subscribe</A></SPAN></SPAN></P></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

North Carolina has some of the weakest coal ash regulations in the country, and Duke has been allowed to store the ash in unlined pits, often next to rivers and other bodies of water. In other states, such as South Carolina, Duke and other coal-producing companies are required to keep their coal ash in lined pits which prevent ash from leaking into groundwater.</P><P>Duke says there’s no proof that the chemicals came from their sites, and the company is still doing testing to determine where exactly the chemicals are coming from. But, spokeswoman Erin Culbert says the company is willing to give anyone who received a letter from the state a supply of bottled water out of an abundance of caution.</P><P>“We want people to have peace of mind,” Culbert said. “We would rather over-prescribe than under-prescribe.”</P><P>Last year, a Duke-owned coal ash pond <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/18/north-carolina-river-coal-ash-spill"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">spilled 82,000 gallons of ash into the Dan river,</A> coating the bottom of the river for dozens of miles. That spurred the state to pass the Coal Ash Management Act in August, which required Duke to begin cleaning up some of its 14 coal ash sites, and mandated testing near all coal ash ponds. The first round of tests was completed last month, and that’s why dozens of North Carolinians are just receiving notices now.</P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-2 | 2""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">EPA reaches deal with <mark>Duke Energy</mark> over coal ash spill</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

The new state law only requires that Duke clean up four ash sites. Duke stores 120 million tons of coal ash in the state, and has said that removing all of it would take years, and cost many millions of dollars – which would probably be reflected in higher energy bills for customers. But activists say the company could follow South Carolina’s lead.</P><P>“We’re not talking about anything hi-tech,” Adams said. “We’re talking about a plastic liner.

Pat McCrory and Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Donald van der Vaart have taken positions on environmental regulations that even <mark>Duke Energy</mark> has indicated it thinks are too extreme.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""article-body""><DIV class=""field-body""><P>Just how extreme is the administration of North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) when it comes to obstructing efforts to protect the environment?
	So extreme that even <mark>Duke Energy</mark> — McCrory's former <A href=""/2014/02/duke-energys-inside-connections-to-the-mccrory-adm.html"">longtime employer</A>, one of his <A href=""/2014/04/new-details-emerge-on-gov-mccrorys-duke-energy-mon.html"">top political benefactors</A>, and a <A href=""https://www.southernenvironment.org/news-and-press/news-feed/duke-energy-pleads-guilty-to-environmental-crimes-in-north-carolina"">major polluter</A> in the state — is calling on it to dial back the anti-environmental obstructionism.
	Speaking at a Jan. 29 forum on the state's energy future, Mark McIntire, Duke's director of environmental policy and affairs, urged North Carolina to take a different approach to the Obama administration's <A href=""http://www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan/clean-power-plan-existing-power-plants"">Clean Power Plan</A> to cut global warming <mark>pollution</mark>. The plan is being <A href=""https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/content/2016.01.26_wv_et_al._scotus_stay_application.pdf"">challenged in court by 29 states</A>, including North Carolina, as well as by corporations and industry groups. The lawsuit is being led by Texas and West Virginia.
	McCrory <A href=""https://governor.nc.gov/press-release/governor-mccrory-criticizes-overreaching-regulations-will-raise-consumer-power-bills"">has charged</A> that the plan would raise electricity rates and amounts to &quot;federal intrusion.&quot; So his administration submitted a compliance proposal that <A href=""http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2015/11/05/advocates-respond-to-mccrory-administrations-assault-on-clean-power-plan/"">fell short </A>of EPA's requirements, with the intention of taking the rejection to court — an approach that's earned condemnation from environmental advocates and criticism from <mark>Duke Energy</mark>.
	&quot;Quite frankly, the approach our state is taking is one that is not collaborative,&quot; McIntire <A href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/energy/2016/01/duke-energy-wants-n-c-to-open-up-planning-for-epa.html"">told</A> the N.C. Leadership Forum panel. &quot;We are continuing to encourage the Department of Environmental Quality to think a little bit larger — let's bring all the stakeholders in the room.&quot;
	At the urging of some of those stakeholders, including utilities and industry groups, the McCrory administration did <A href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/energy/2015/11/n-c-agrees-to-submit-alternate-clean-power-plan.html"">agree to develop a backup plan</A> that would comply with EPA requirements in order to avoid having a federal plan imposed on it.
	But apparently that was not enough to assuage <mark>Duke Energy</mark>'s concerns that the administration isn't doing enough to involve affected parties in shaping a constructive response to federal efforts to curb <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.<STRONG>NC fights rules despite being on track for compliance</STRONG>
	The Clean Power Plan experienced a setback this week, when the U.S. Supreme Court <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/us/politics/supreme-court-blocks-obama-epa-coal-emissions-regulations.html?smid=fb-share&amp;_r=3&amp;referer"">temporarily blocked it</A> as an appeals court considers the expedited challenge to the rule. The Obama administration <A href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/press-secretary-josh-earnest-supreme-courts-decision-stay-clean-power"">says</A> it's &quot;confident&quot; it will &quot;prevail on the merits.&quot; Most Americans <A href=""http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/11/02/61-percent-of-public-supports-clean-power-plan-in-states-suing-to-stop-it"">support the plan</A> — including a majority of North Carolina residents and those in most of the other states suing over the regulations.
	First proposed in 2014, the Clean Power Plan sets standards for power plants and goals for states to cut <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>. States are supposed to submit compliance plans by September, though they can apply for a two-year extension. The first deadline for emission cuts comes in 2022, with full compliance required by 2030.
	<mark>Duke Energy</mark> challenged the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions through the <A href=""http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jwalke/UARG%20members%20from%202006%20filing%20on%20PM%20standards.pdf%20-%20Adobe%20Acrobat%20Pro.pdf"">Utility Air Regulatory Group</A>, a broad alliance of energy companies; the case, which went to the U.S. Supreme Court, <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_Air_Regulatory_Group_v._Environmental_Protection_Agency"">largely upheld the EPA's powers</A>. Duke is <A href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/energy/2015/10/duke-energy-looks-to-cooperate-with-states-on.html"">now working with the six states in which it operates</A> — the Carolinas, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio — to discuss ways to comply with the Clean Power Plan. All of those states are parties to the lawsuit against the plan.
	Under the federal rules, North Carolina would have to cut its <mark>carbon</mark> emissions 32 percent by 2030. Environmental advocates have pointed out that the state is already <A href=""https://mountainx.com/news/nc-fights-epas-clean-power-plan/"">on track to reach the required reductions</A> thanks to existing environmental laws including the Clean Smokestacks Act and the state's renewable energy portfolio standard.
	In a <A href=""http://wcqs.org/post/sec-van-der-vaart-defends-oft-criticized-deq#stream/0"">recent radio interview</A>, N.C. DEQ Secretary Donald van der Vaart acknowledged that the state would &quot;probably be able to achieve that mandate naturally.&quot; However, he said, &quot;that doesn't mean that I'm going to sign on to a rule that is inherently illegal.&quot; An engineer and attorney, van der Vaart previously worked as a North Carolina air quality regulator and in research and regulatory positions for private-sector energy companies.
	But his judgment of the plan's legality is not shared by the 18 states, two dozen power companies, clean-energy associations, and public health and environmental groups <A href=""http://www.nrdc.org/media/2016/160204.asp"">supporting the plan</A>. North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper, a Democrat who is running for governor, has also <A href=""http://www.citizen-times.com/story/elections/2015/08/12/roy-cooper-clean-power-plan/31534109/"">called on the state to comply</A>.
	&quot;When a politician and his appointees are dragging their feet on <mark>climate</mark> action even over the objections of one of America's biggest corporate owners of coal and nuclear generating plants, you know that they have gone off the deepest end of the unreasonable scale,&quot; according to an <A href=""http://nclcv.org/news/cib/20160208/"">analysis by the N.C. League of Conservation Voters</A>.<STRONG>Is nuclear power really &quot;clean&quot;?</STRONG>
	Speaking of North Carolina's renewable energy portfolio standard, that has also emerged as a point of disagreement between the McCrory administration and <mark>Duke Energy</mark>.
	Passed into law in 2007 by an <A href=""http://ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2007&amp;BillID=s3&amp;submitButton=Go"">overwhelming majority </A>of state lawmakers as a way to jumpstart a cleaner energy economy, <A href=""http://www.ncuc.commerce.state.nc.us/reps/reps.htm"">North Carolina's standard</A> requires the state's investor-owned utilities to meet 12.5 percent of their retail sales through energy efficiency or renewable sources by 2021. North Carolina was the first state in the Southeast to adopt such a standard.
	What constitutes a renewable source? Here's <A href=""http://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_62/GS_62-133.8.html"">what North Carolina's law says</A>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>
	a solar electric, solar thermal, wind, hydropower, geothermal, or ocean current or wave energy  resource; a biomass resource, including agricultural waste, animal waste, wood waste, spent pulping liquors, combustible residues, combustible liquids, combustible gases, energy crops, or landfill methane; waste heat derived from a renewable energy resource and used to produce electricity or useful, measurable thermal energy at a retail electric customer's facility; or hydrogen derived from a renewable energy resource.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>What doesn't constitute a renewable source? The law is<A href=""http://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_62/GS_62-133.8.html""> clear on that, too</A>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>
	'Renewable energy resource' does not include peat, a fossil fuel, or nuclear energy resource.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>But at a recent meeting of the <A href=""http://www.geology.enr.state.nc.us/web/lr/energy-policy-council"">N.C. Energy Policy Council</A>, a state advisory group, DEQ's van der Vaart <A href=""http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/why-is-duke-energy-pushing-to-make-nuclear-clean/Content?oid=4988947"">pushed hard</A> for the group to call on the legislature to amend the law to include nuclear power on the list of approved energy resources — despite its serious safety and security risks, radioactive-waste disposal challenges, and intense water requirements. <A href=""http://www.wral.com/nc-environmental-chief-backs-restriction-on-solar-farms-incentives-for-nuclear-plants/15284709/"">Describing nuclear energy as &quot;clean,&quot;</A> van der Vaart and said it &quot;needs to be incentivized.&quot;
	<mark>Duke Energy</mark> is heavily dependent on nuclear power, which accounts for <A href=""https://www.duke-energy.com/north-carolina/nc-rate-case/our-energy-mix.asp"">56.8 percent of its generation mix</A> in the Carolinas, and CEO Lynn Good recently <A href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/energy/2016/01/duke-energy-ceo-we-need-to-talk-about-nuclear.html"">discussed its importance</A> in a <mark>carbon</mark>-restricted energy economy. But even so, it was <mark>Duke Energy</mark>'s representative on the council, Rob Caldwell, who <A href=""http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/why-is-duke-energy-pushing-to-make-nuclear-clean/Content?oid=4988947"">pushed back against van der Vaart's proposal</A>, arguing that a &quot;one-off&quot; vote for nuclear power wasn't wise. He also said the issue was &quot;significantly more complicated&quot; than van der Vaart described.
	In the end, the council delayed its vote on the recommendation. They plan to discuss it again at their next meeting in March.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""article-info border-top medium-padding""><H2 class=""h4"">Tags</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Nothing is set in stone; the project must first clear the hurdle of the N.C. Utilities Commission. If it does, the two Dukes would then hammer out specific terms before signing the deal. The project, estimated to cost roughly $55 million, could be functional as soon as 2018.</P><P>But not everyone's happy about this. Clean-energy advocates on campus view the timing of the announcement—days after students departed for their hometowns and summer internships—as evidence of an attempt to thwart public discussion on the issue. There also exists an impression that Duke leadership forged this partnership in a less-than-transparent manner.</P><P>&quot;Students and faculty had no knowledge that negotiations were even taking place until the final proposal was made public in May,&quot; says Claire Wang, president of the Duke <mark>Climate</mark> Coalition, a student advocacy group. &quot;A decision of this magnitude requires a transparent, campus-wide dialogue to take into account the expertise of faculty and the interests of students. A series of briefings done behind closed doors is wildly insufficient.&quot;</P><P>This matters, Wang and others argue, because the plant is inconsistent with Duke University's long-term goals for energy efficiency. Back in 2009, Duke University laid out one of the most aggressive plans in the country for achieving <mark>climate</mark> neutrality. The aim was, and remains, for the school to have a net-zero <mark>carbon</mark> footprint by 2024.</P><P>The proposed natural gas plant does have some environmentally friendly virtues. It is a combined heat and power facility. That means excess heat brought about by the production of electricity is recovered and converted into thermal energy, which can then be used for steam, space heating, and water heating at the school. University officials believe this added efficiency will reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by 25 percent.</P><P>But natural gas is, of course, a fossil fuel; it releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. And while nobody is arguing that the school could immediately power itself solely on renewable energy, a lot can happen in thirty-five years. And under the arrangement outlined in the proposal, Duke University would be tethering itself to dirty energy for the next three decades.</P><DIV class=""contentImageRight"" style=""overflow:hidden;""><SPAN class=""clicktozoom"">click to enlarge</SPAN></DIV><P>&quot;Future trajectories of renewable energy are only improving—the cost of renewable generation will continue to decline while gas prices will fluctuate and rise,&quot; Wang says. &quot;The university must not merely consider the economics of renewables in the present; it must consider how renewables will evolve over the next several decades.&quot;</P><P>The 2009 <mark>climate</mark> action plan even anticipated a similar scenario: &quot;There will likely be a point in time when it becomes counterproductive for the university to produce electricity using natural gas—even with the added efficiency of combined heat and power production,&quot; the document reads.  </P><P>Duke University executive vice president Tallman Trask III tells the <I>INDY</I> that the real appeal of the project is the school's need for dependable power to back up Duke Hospital. The natural gas plant would be more reliable and cause less <mark>pollution</mark> than the two diesel generators the school currently uses as backup.</P><P>&quot;I understand the purist argument that all fossil fuels are bad,&quot; Trask says. &quot;From our standpoint, the primary driver here is the continuity of electricity. We run the largest hospital in the Carolinas, and it's dependent on electricity sent here from very long distances, and the grid can fail. We can't afford to let the hospital lose power, and this is an economic way of guaranteeing the availability of power for the hospital and research labs. Solar can't achieve that kind of reliability right now.&quot;</P><P>Trask adds: &quot;Environmentally, this plan is slightly better than the current status quo because, on the margins, it does reduce the amount of natural gas we're burning. My guess is we'll probably save a couple million dollars a year. But that's not the main reason we are pursuing this.&quot;</P><P>Trask also walks back the thirty-five-year commitment cited in the May press release. &quot;I don't know where that number came from,&quot; he says. &quot;If we do the deal—and, remember, we don't know yet if the utilities commission will approve it, and under what conditions it will approve it—we will retain the option of discontinuing our use of the plant at various points in the future. We've said we're not willing to sign an irrevocable long-term deal.&quot;</P><P>Of course, nobody besides top Duke University and <mark>Duke Energy</mark> officials can say with certainty what the terms of this natural gas plant agreement might be. If the announcement proposing the plant caught many people off guard, the announcement of the terms of the deal might also catch faculty and staff by surprise.</P><P>Drew Shindell, professor of <mark>climate</mark> sciences at Duke's Nicholas School of the Environment, says that, while he is disappointed by the process—&quot;The university is supposed to be a pretty egalitarian place, with faculty council, student council, and others having input on decisions like this, and that didn't happen here&quot;—he views the natural gas plant as pragmatic, to a point.</P><P>&quot;Imagine a natural disaster that inflicts one hundred million dollars in damages,&quot; Shindell says. &quot;You need to rebuild, you raise money, but you only raise twenty million. That's better than nothing. But if the question is whether that amount is adequate in the face of the problems you've got, then the answer is no, it's not. Likewise, the natural gas plant will lead to reduced environmental impact, but not nearly at the level Duke acknowledges in its own <mark>climate</mark> plan that it needs to be headed.&quot;</P><P><I>This article appeared in print with the headline &quot;Blowing Off Steam&quot;</I></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It’s creating an unjust  system where only the wealthy can afford renewable energy and everyone else is  forced to buy dirty power from giant utilities.” </P><P>The  local <mark>climate</mark>-justice nonprofit NC WARN agreed to install solar panels on the  Faith Community Church in exchange for repayment based on the electricity generated.  Such power purchase agreements drive solar development in many states by  helping people pay over time when they can't afford rooftop solar's upfront  costs.</P><P>At  the urging of <mark>Duke Energy</mark>, the state’s monopoly utility, North Carolina  regulators determined that the agreement violated a state statute prohibiting third-party  sales of electricity to the public. NC WARN appealed the order, which resulted  in a contentious, split lower-court decision.</P><P>The  nonprofit’s <A href=""http://www.ncwarn.org/2017/11/solar-church-test-case-filed-at-nc-supreme-court/"" target=""_blank"">appeal</A> to the decision is now being heard by the North Carolina  Supreme Court. The Center’s amicus brief submitted in support of the appeal was  also signed by other national nonprofits, including Greenpeace, Inc., Friends  of the Earth U.S., Food and Water Watch and the Institute for Local  Self-Reliance.</P><P>“From  catastrophic super-storms to disastrous droughts, we’re already feeling the  devastating effects of <mark>climate change</mark>,” said de Jong. “We urgently need to  transition to cleaner sources of power for the planet and everyone who lives on  it. Corporate, profit-driven utilities shouldn’t be allowed to stand in the way  of a just and clean energy revolution.” </P><P>North  Carolina is one of a handful of states that prohibits power purchase  agreements. Others include Florida, Kentucky and  Oklahoma. This legal mechanism is one way utilities have attempted to block or  shut down distributed solar development. Other tactics, such as charging unfair  fees and eliminating net metering programs, have hobbled solar growth in states  like Arizona and Nevada.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE border=""0"" width=""100%"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" bgcolor=""#FFFFFF""><TBODY><TR><TD width=""800"" align=""left"" valign=""top"" class=""bodytext"" style=""padding: 10px 10px 16px 10px; line-height: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;""><P id=""about"" align=""center""><I>The Center for Biological Diversity is a national, nonprofit  conservation organization with more than 1.5 million members and online  activists dedicated to the protection of endangered species and wild places.</I></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>"

	<mark>Duke Energy</mark> is an electric utility company based in Charlotte, NC.  <A href=""http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Duke_Energy#History""><mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s origins</A> stem back to 1900 from a small hydroelectric company called the Catawba Power Company, which evolved into Duke Power and eventually into <mark>Duke Energy</mark> after a 1997 merger with PanEnergy. As of the third quarter of 2011, <mark>Duke Energy</mark> held more than $60 <A href=""http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/IncomeStatement.jsp?tkr=DUK"">billion</A> in assets, while pulling a gross operating profit of more than $5 billion in 2010.</P><P>
	<mark>Duke Energy</mark> was poised to become the nation’s largest utility company on January 1, 2012, as it planned to purchase Progress Energy, based in Raleigh. The new company (which will continue under the name <mark>Duke Energy</mark>) would supply more than 7 million <A href=""http://www.technicianonline.com/features/duke-progress-merger-to-affect-jobs-and-bills-1.2673263#.TtablGPXvEU"">customers</A>. The first proposal for the merger was rejected by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on September 20, 2011 on the grounds that the merger would have a negative impact on competition in the Southeast electricity market. In December the proposal was <A href=""http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/12/15/1712048/duke-progress-merger-denied-again.html"">once again rejected</A> by FERC, stating that the revisions of capping their profit at 10% of some wholesale power sales were inadequate. In June 2012, however, the Duke-Progress merger was conditionally approved by FERC, allowing the $26-billion deal to move ahead.</P><P>
	The merger also posed concerns among environmental groups, who argued that the merger between Duke and Progress would give the new <mark>Duke Energy</mark> company such a hold on the <A href=""http://www.southernenvironment.org/uploads/fck/PUBLIC%20Hahn%20Testimony%20NCUC%20E-2Sub998,E-7Sub986.pdf"">electricity market</A> [PDF] as to minimize entry for independent renewables. The merger would also likely increase <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s dependence on “less efficient, higher-polluting coal” plants.</P><P>
	Although <A href=""http://polluterwatch.com/bill-johnson"">Bill Johnson</A>, former CEO of Progress Energy, was originally set to be become president and board director of the merged company, within hours of the first day after the merger, Johnson unexpectedly resigned, with Jim Rogers taking his place as CEO. As a result, suspicions have been raised, causing the North Carolina Utilities Commission and Attorney General to conduct <A href=""http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/07/06/3367208/as-ceo-scandal-spreads-nc-attorney.html"">separate investigations</A> on Rogers.</P><P>
	Further speculation was raised when Rogers testified before the N.C. Utilities Commission, stating that Johnson's  management practices were &quot;autocratic&quot; and weak, which fueled the CEO switch. John Mullin III, a Progress Energy director, describes the situation as <A href=""http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/07/15/2199001/progress-energy-directors-lauded.html"">“the most blatant example of corporate deceit that I have witnessed during a long career on Wall Street.”</A></P><P>

The per capita income in all three areas was less than $16,000, and one of the plants, the R.

The region already has more than 4 times the amount of <A href=""http://www.sierraclub.org/environmentallaw/coal/getBlurb.aspx?case=indiana-dukeenergyvectren.aspx"">power capacity</A> as is needed, with “one of the highest concentrations of coal-fired generators in the world.&quot;</P><P>	In 2010, the project director for Edwardsport confidentially wrote to Duke complaining of “<A href=""http://www.indystar.com/assets/pdf/BG169685129.PDF"">significant risks</A>” [PDF] the utility had taken on the plant’s construction process.  In another communication, Duke executive Richard Hayiland wrote, “we need an <A href=""http://indianadg.wordpress.com/2011/02/01/contractor-says-duke-took-risks-at-edwardsport-plant-in-indiana-letters-show-rift-over-work-at-2-9b-facility/"">exorcist</A> on this job.”</P><P>	Originally budgeted for between $1.3 and 1.6 billion, the cost for Edwardsport swelled to <A href=""http://www.sierraclub.org/environmentallaw/coal/getBlurb.aspx?case=indiana-dukeenergyvectren.aspx"">$2.98 billion</A> by October 2011. <mark>Duke Energy</mark> was blasted earlier that year  by the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor as the company attempted to push $530 million in Edwardsport costs onto customers. An OUCC director <A href=""http://www.indianaeconomicdigest.net/main.asp?SectionID=31&amp;ArticleID=60839"">testified</A> that “Duke has not demonstrated any budgetary constraints on this project” and that the “escalating costs have been borne solely by ratepayers, with the benefits going to the [Duke] shareholders.”</P><P>	As of the posting of this profile, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) was in the midst of deciding “whether Duke committed fraud, concealment or gross mismanagement” regarding the plant’s massive <A href=""http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/duke-testifies-iurc-edwardsport-plant-costs-22456/"">cost</A> overruns. Jim Rogers himself <A href=""http://www.indystar.com/article/20111027/NEWS14/110270360/star-watch-duke-energy-Edwardsport-iurc"">testified</A> before the IURC, saying “Yes, [the plant is] expensive. But it will be the cleanest plant in Indiana.” Meanwhile, <mark>Duke Energy</mark> paid a consultancy more than $<A href=""http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011111010350"">3 million</A> dollars to testify on the issue.</P><P>	In April 2012, Duke settled on Edwardsport's cost overruns with its largest customers and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor. Duke would take on $700 million, while customers would see a rate hike of 14.5% over two years. By that point the plant's expected costs had reached <A href=""http://www.indystar.com/article/20120501/BUSINESS/205010324/Deal-will-requir"">$3.3 billion</A>, with plans to begin service that fall. The Indiana Utility Consumer Counselor argued that it was time to move on from the issue. In October 2012, Duke revealed that <A href=""http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/10/31/3635072/troubled-plants-to-cost-duke-energy.html"">Edwardsport</A> was expected to cost over $3.5 billion and might not begin operation until as late as mid-2013.</P><P>	The Edwardsport project has also stirred controversy regarding Duke’s relationship with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Reports by The Indianapolis Star revealed that in early 2010 Duke CEO Jim Rogers and Vice President James Turner held private meetings with IURC chair <A href=""http://www.indystar.com/article/20110224/BUSINESS/102240469/The-1-billion-question-there-undue-influence-"">David Hardy</A> and Indiana Governor <A href=""http://www.indystar.com/article/20111113/NEWS14/111130337/Duke-leader-met-privately-Gov-Mitch-Daniels"">Mitch Daniels</A> to warn of some of the new costs associated with the construction of Edwardsport.</P><P>	While <mark>Duke Energy</mark> argued that the meetings were merely a “courtesy heads-up,” other correspondence between Turner and Hardy and between Turner and Rogers raised concerns that Duke may have violated the law by attempting to influence the course of IURC decisions on Edwardsport. During the course of email correspondence between Hardy and Turner, Turner offered to host Hardy and his wife on Turner’s private boat, and even hinted that Hardy could find employment at Duke should he rule favorably toward the company. According to the Indianapolis Star, <A href=""http://www.indystar.com/article/20110224/BUSINESS/102240469/The-1-billion-question-there-undue-influence-"">Turner</A> also communicated to Rogers that “he intended to give plenty of attention to the Edwardsport plant and try to shift costs away from the utility.”</P><P>	Turner <A href=""http://www.indystar.com/article/20111113/NEWS14/111130337/Duke-leader-met-privately-Gov-Mitch-Daniels"">resigned</A> from <mark>Duke Energy</mark> in the wake of The Indianapolis Star’s reporting.

Duke Energy spent $11.632 million in 2014 and 2015 on federal lobbying (opensecrets.org). These figures do not include lobbying expenditures to influence legislation in states, where Duke Energy also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, Duke Energy spent approximately $1.78 million on lobbying in North Carolina for 2014 and 2015, and Duke Energy’s lobbying in North Carolina coal ash legislation has drawn media attention (“Duke’s CEO Met with NC Senate Leaders on Coal Ash,” Charlotte Observer, June 9, 2016).</P><P>Duke Energy is a member of the Business Roundtable and the Edison Electric Institute, which together spent $50.91 million lobbying in 2014 and 2015. Duke Energy does not disclose its specific memberships in or payments to trade associations, or the detailed amounts used for lobbying on its website. We are concerned that our company’s current lack of detailed trade association disclosure presents reputational risk.</P><P>Duke Energy also does not disclose membership in or contributions to tax‑exempt organizations that write and endorse model legislation, such as being a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Duke Energy’s ALEC membership has attracted press scrutiny (“ALEC and Duke Energy Going after a Small N.C. Non‑Profit and Church for Going Solar,” PoliticusUSA, November 14, 2015). More than 100 companies have publicly left ALEC, including 3M, Ameren, BP, ConocoPhillips, PG&amp;E and Shell.</P><P>This resolution received 34% voting support in 2016.</P><H2>Opposing Statement of the Board of Directors:</H2><P><SPAN style=""color: #005984;"">Your Board of Directors recommends a vote “AGAINST” this proposal for the following reasons:</SPAN></P><P>Duke Energy is committed to adhering to the highest standards of ethics in engaging in any lobbying activities. As a public utility holding company, the Corporation is highly regulated. As such, the Board of Directors believes that it is in Duke Energy’s and our shareholders’ best interests to participate in the political process to ensure that local, state and federal lawmakers understand and consider the interests of the Corporation, our customers, employees, shareholders, communities and other stakeholders. The Corporation does this through a government relations program and memberships in trade organizations. Duke Energy’s lobbying activities and political expenditures are overseen by the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, in accordance with the Committee’s Charter as well as Duke Energy’s Political Activity Policy.</P><P><EM>Oversight over Political Activities</EM></P><P>In 2015, Duke Energy updated its Political Activity Policy and enhanced the governance around the Corporation’s lobbying activities and political expenditures. These changes were a direct result of discussions with our shareholders during our corporate governance engagements with them.</P><P>The Political Activity Policy is disclosed on the Corporate Governance page of our website at <A href=""http://www.duke-energy.com/our-company/investors/corporate-governance/political-activity-policy"" target=""_blank"">www.duke-energy.com/our-company/investors/corporate-governance/political-activity-policy</A>. Pursuant to the Political Activity Policy as well as the Charter of the Corporate Governance Committee, also disclosed on the Corporate governance page of our website at <A href=""http://www.duke-energy.com/our-company/investors/corporate-governance/board-committee-charters/corporate-governance"" target=""_blank"">www.duke-energy.com/our-company/investors/corporate-governance/board-committee-charters/corporate-governance</A>, the ultimate oversight of the Corporation’s policies, practices and strategy with respect to political expenditures is the responsibility of the Corporate Governance Committee.</P><P>In addition to the oversight of the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, the Corporation enhanced its governance of lobbying activities and political expenditures in 2015. A tiered governance process was implemented that requires increasing levels of authority within the Corporation depending on the dollar amounts of the lobbying or other political expenditure being proposed. A Political Expenditures Committee, comprised of senior executives, reviews and provides a Corporation political expenditure strategy and monitors and tracks corporate political expenditures (the “Political Expenditures Program”). The Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors periodically reviews the strategy, policies and practices of the corporate Political Expenditures Program.</P><P><EM>Duke Energy has historically made certain lobbying related information publicly available and has recently enhanced such disclosures.</EM></P><P>The Corporation’s corporate political contributions and lobbying activities are also subject to regulation by the state and federal government, including detailed disclosure requirements which are publicly available. Duke Energy is fully compliant with all federal and state laws governing corporate political contributions and lobbying activities. As a result of the feedback we received from our shareholders during the shareholder corporate governance engagement program, the Corporation has also made changes to how it reports on contributions and lobbying activities. In 2016, Duke Energy began to disclose all reported lobbying expenses, DUKEPAC contributions and corporate contributions in the aggregate by category on a semi‑annual report which is posted directly on our website at <A href=""http://www.duke-energy.com/our-company/investors/corporate-governance/political-activity-policy"" target=""_blank"">www.duke-energy.com/our-company/investors/corporate-governance/political-activity-policy</A>. Disclosing this information on one report allows the information to be more easily accessed and viewed by our shareholders. The Corporation’s lobbying activities and expenditures are also discussed in our annual Sustainability Report, available at <A href=""http://www.duke-energy.com/our-company/sustainability/reports"" target=""_blank"">www.duke‑energy.com/our‑company/sustainability/reports</A>.</P><P>Accordingly, because the Corporation is fully compliant with all federal and state regulations regarding corporate political contributions and lobbying related expenditures and disclosure and, based on shareholder engagement and feedback, has supplemented our compliance with improved governance and website disclosure, the Board of Directors believes that the additional report requested in the proposal would result in an unnecessary and unproductive use of the Corporation’s resources.</P><H5>For the Above Reasons the Board of Directors Recommends a Vote “AGAINST” This Proposal.</H5><H2>Proposal 7: Shareholder Proposal Regarding Preparing an Assessment of the Impacts on <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s Portfolio of <mark>Climate Change</mark> Consistent with a Two Degree Scenario</H2><P>The State of New York, State Comptroller, on behalf of the New York State Common Retirement Fund and the New York State and Local Retirement System, 59 Maiden Lane – 30th Floor, New York, New York 10038, owners of 1,699,500 shares of Duke Energy common stock, and Everence Financial, 1110 N.

<mark>Climate Change</mark>: 2 Degree Scenario Analysis</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>WHEREAS:</STRONG> In November 2016 the Paris Agreement entered into force and its goal of keeping global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius will begin to shape national policy decisions. To meet this goal the International Energy Agency estimates that the global average <mark>carbon</mark> intensity of electricity production will need to drop by 90 percent. As long‑term shareholders, we would like to understand how Duke Energy is planning for the risks and opportunities presented by global efforts to keep global temperatures within acceptable boundaries.</P><P>In June 2016, the credit rating agency Moody’s indicated that they would begin to analyze <mark>carbon</mark> transition risk based on scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement, and noted the high <mark>carbon</mark> risk exposure of the power sector.</P><P>Rapid expansion of low <mark>carbon</mark> technologies including distributed solar, battery storage, grid modernization, energy efficiency and electric vehicles provide not only challenges for utility business models but also opportunities for growth. Many large corporations are actively seeking to increase their use of renewable energy, providing a significant market opportunity for forward‑thinking utilities. The International Energy Agency and the International Council on Clean Transportation forecast that electrification of transport will play a critical role in achieving the necessary greenhouse gas reductions by 2050.</P><P>Duke Energy is the 2nd largest <mark>CO2</mark> emitter in the U.S., has not set a science‑based greenhouse gas reduction goal and does not provide information on its long term strategy or plan to de<mark>carbon</mark>ize in ways that are consistent with the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement or a 2 Degree Scenario.

The Corporation has worked to modernize its system, and we established voluntary <mark>carbon</mark> reduction goals in 2010. Since 1999, the Corporation has invested more than $7.5 billion in environmental control equipment to lower emissions from its power plants. The Corporation’s <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions have decreased 28% since 2005 and our <mark>carbon</mark> intensity has decreased from 1.29 pounds per net kWh in 2005 to 0.99 pounds per net kWh in 2015. Although we are the largest utility in the nation, we rank fifty‑fifth in <mark>carbon</mark> intensity at 1120 pounds per MWh according to M.J. Bradley &amp; Associate’s 2016 report, Benchmarking Air Emissions of the 100 Largest Electric Power Producers in the United States.</P><P>We have announced plans to retire more than 1,800 megawatts of coal generation and invest $4 billion in new, efficient natural gas facilities by 2020. The Corporation has also made substantial investments in renewable energy, the research and development of battery storage and has introduced a solar rebate program for certain customers in its South Carolina service territory. Since 2007, the Corporation has invested almost $5 billion to grow its wind and solar power businesses and owns and operates about 2,800 megawatts of renewable generation in more than a dozen states throughout the United States. In 2016, Duke Energy also announced plans to invest approximately $3 billion more in renewables by 2020.</P><P>Duke Energy is subject to extensive regulations at both the state and federal levels, including regulation by state and federal environmental agencies, state utility commissions, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. State utility commissions have broad powers of supervision and regulation over the Corporation’s regulated utilities within their state, which generally includes, among other things, supervision and regulation of their resource planning, operations, rates, and the terms and conditions of service. Duke Energy’s planning process, including its environmental compliance strategy, is designed to incorporate compliance with all applicable laws and regulations while maintaining the lowest reasonable cost to consumers, as is required by the state utility commissions.</P><P>Duke Energy’s robust resource planning process addresses many of the concerns contained in the proposal. To best meet its commitments to both customers and investors, the Corporation has been planning and will continue to plan for <mark>carbon</mark> constraints in the near and long term. Using a scenario planning approach which is disclosed in our Integrated Resource Plans (“IRPs”) that are filed with and disclosed on the websites of the state utility commissions for the states in which we serve, the Corporation evaluates its generation needs and the infrastructure required to meet forecasted customer electricity demand based on multiple variables and varying potential stringencies of future <mark>carbon</mark> requirements.</P><P>Finally, much of the information requested for inclusion in the report is already available in the Corporation’s public disclosures. In addition to the disclosures in the Corporation’s periodic reports filed with the SEC and in the IRPs discussed above, the Corporation’s annual Sustainability Report includes data on emissions and actions being undertaken to address those emissions. The Corporation also regularly engages with environmental stakeholders covering a range of topics – including regulatory and policy issues, energy efficiency, and emissions. In fact, in 2016, after engaging in discussions with some of the Corporation’s shareholders regarding providing additional information on Duke Energy’s forecasting process, the Corporation added additional information to the Sustainability Report in the article “Planning for the Future” located online which explains how Duke Energy approaches planning for the future, the actions Duke Energy is taking today to prepare for the type of changes highlighted in the proposal and links to the IRPs for more detailed information.</P><P>In summary, the Board of Directors does not believe it is in the best interests of the Corporation or its shareholders to prepare such a report at this time due to Duke Energy’s efforts relating to <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions reduction, its resource planning process which considers varying stringencies of future <mark>carbon</mark> constraints, and the Corporation’s extensive disclosure included in various public reports of emissions data, emission reduction results, investments, and significant policy engagement. Developing a separate report as requested in the proposal would be an inefficient use of Corporation resources and will not add value to the Corporation’s current efforts in this area.</P><H5>For the Above Reasons the Board of Directors Recommends a Vote “AGAINST” This Proposal.</H5><H2>Proposal 8: Shareholder Proposal Regarding Providing a Report on the Public Health Risk of <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s Coal Use</H2><P>As You Sow, on behalf of Andrew Behar, 1611 Telegraph Avenue, Suite 1450, Oakland, California 94612, owner of 50 shares of Duke Energy common stock, and Daughters of Charity, Inc., 2039 North Geyer Road, St. Louis, Missouri 63131, owners of 40 shares, submitted the following proposal:</P><P style=""text-align: center;""><STRONG>REPORT ON PUBLIC HEALTH RISK FROM DUKE’S COAL USE</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><STRONG>WHEREAS:</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: left;"">The use of coal produces well‑established harms to public health including water contamination, poor air quality, and <mark>climate change</mark>:</P><UL><LI><EM>Water contamination. </EM>Coal burning results in coal waste ‑also called coal ash‑ which is laced with heavy metals such as arsenic, and which can contaminate water and raise cancer risk with long term exposure.

under certain circumstances. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">The
amounts shown above with respect to stock awards were calculated based on a variety of assumptions, including the following: (i) the named executive officer terminated employment on
December 31, 2016; (ii) a stock price for Duke Energy common stock equal to $77.62, which was the closing price on December 30, 2016; (iii) the continuation of

substantially in the form attached to this proxy statement as Appendix A, to eliminate the current requirement in the Certificate for an affirmative vote of the combined voting power of 80% of
the outstanding shares of all classes of Duke Energy entitled to vote in the election of directors to approve certain actions. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">At
the 2016 Annual Meeting, Duke Energy's shareholders voted on a shareholder proposal requesting that our Board of Directors take the steps necessary to eliminate the supermajority
requirements in Duke Energy's Certificate. The shareholder proposal was approved by approximately 53% of the votes cast. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">In
determining whether to recommend the amendment to the Certificate to the Corporation's shareholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting, the Corporate Governance Committee and the Board discussed both the
arguments against the amendment as well as those for. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">In
advocating against the shareholder proposal to eliminate the supermajority requirements in the Certificate of Incorporation at the 2016 Annual Meeting, the Board explained its concern that the
supermajority requirements in the Corporation's Certificate were limited to the few specific instances discussed below, and that a supermajority requirement was appropriate during those instances to
safeguard that a broad consensus of Duke Energy's shareholders was obtained prior to making
those fundamental governance changes and to protect minority shareholders from the actions of potentially self-interested short-term shareholders. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">However,
weighing heavily on the Corporate Governance Committee and Board's ultimate decision to recommend this amendment were the results of the shareholder proposal which passed at the 2016 Annual
Meeting and the discussions about the amendment that were had with shareholders during the course of the Corporation's corporate governance engagements with shareholders. These shareholders advocated
that elimination of supermajority approval standards in the Certificate would provide shareholders greater ability to participate in the corporate governance of the Corporation rather than the current
percentage required. The Board also recognized that supermajority requirements are viewed by many corporate governance experts as overly burdensome and not in line with the best principles in
corporate governance. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">After
careful consideration of the vote results at the 2016 Annual Meeting and the Corporation's discussions with shareholders, the Board decided to recommend an amendment to our Certificate to reduce

Supporting Statement    </B></FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">We
encourage transparency and accountability in Duke Energy's use of corporate funds to influence legislation and regulation. Duke Energy spent $11.632 million in 2014 and 2015 on
federal lobbying (opensecrets.org). These figures do not include lobbying expenditures to influence legislation in states, where Duke Energy also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. For
example, Duke Energy spent approximately $1.78 million on lobbying in North Carolina for 2014 and 2015, and Duke Energy's lobbying in North Carolina coal ash legislation has drawn
media attention (&quot;Duke's CEO Met with NC Senate Leaders on Coal Ash,&quot; </FONT><FONT size=""2""><I>Charlotte Observer</I></FONT><FONT size=""2"">, June 9, 2016). </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">Duke Energy
is a member of the Business Roundtable and the Edison Electric Institute, which together spent $50.91 million lobbying in 2014 and 2015. Duke Energy does not disclose
its specific memberships in or payments to trade associations, or the detailed amounts used for lobbying on its website. We are concerned that our company's current lack of detailed trade association
disclosure presents reputational risk. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">Duke Energy
also does not disclose membership in or contributions to tax-exempt organizations that write and endorse model legislation, such as being a member of the American Legislative
Exchange Council (ALEC). Duke Energy's ALEC membership has attracted press scrutiny (&quot;ALEC and Duke Energy Going after a Small N.C. Non-Profit and Church for Going Solar,&quot; </FONT><FONT size=""2""><I>PoliticusUSA</I></FONT><FONT size=""2"">,
November 14, 2015). More than 100 companies have publicly left ALEC, including 3M, Ameren, BP, ConocoPhillips, PG&amp;E and Shell. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">This

Opposing Statement of the Board of Directors:    </B></FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT color=""#376179"" size=""2""><B>Your Board of Directors recommends a vote &quot;AGAINST&quot; this proposal for the following
reasons:</B></FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">Duke Energy is committed to adhering to the highest standards of ethics in engaging in any lobbying activities. As a public utility holding company, the
Corporation is highly regulated. As such, the Board of Directors believes that it is in Duke Energy's and our shareholders' best interests to participate in the political process to ensure that
local, state and federal lawmakers understand and consider the interests of the Corporation, our customers, employees, shareholders, communities and other stakeholders. The Corporation does this
through a government relations program and memberships in trade organizations. Duke Energy's lobbying activities and political expenditures are overseen by the Corporate Governance Committee of
the Board of Directors, in accordance with the Committee's Charter as well as Duke Energy's Political Activity Policy. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify;margin-left:0pt;text-indent:-0pt;""><FONT size=""2""><I>Oversight over Political Activities  </I></FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">In 2015, Duke Energy updated its Political Activity Policy and enhanced the governance around the Corporation's lobbying activities and political
expenditures. These changes were a direct result of discussions with our shareholders during our corporate governance engagements with them. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">The
Political Activity Policy is disclosed on the Corporate Governance page of our website at </FONT><FONT size=""2""><I>www.duke-energy.com/our-company/investors/corporate-governance/political-activity-policy</I></FONT><FONT size=""2"">. Pursuant to the
Political Activity Policy as well as the Charter
of the Corporate Governance Committee, also disclosed on the Corporate governance page of our website at </FONT><FONT size=""2""><I>www.duke-energy.com/our-company/investors/corporate-governance/board-committee-charters/corporate-governance</I></FONT><FONT size=""2"">, the ultimate oversight of the Corporation's
policies, practices and strategy with respect to political expenditures is the responsibility of the Corporate Governance Committee. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">In
addition to the oversight of the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, the Corporation enhanced its governance of lobbying activities and political expenditures in 2015. A
tiered governance process was implemented that requires increasing levels of authority within the Corporation depending on the dollar amounts of the lobbying or other political expenditure being
proposed. A Political Expenditures Committee, comprised of senior executives, reviews and provides a Corporation political expenditure strategy and monitors and tracks corporate political expenditures
(the &quot;Political Expenditures Program&quot;). The Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors periodically reviews the strategy, policies and practices of the corporate Political Expenditures
Program. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify;margin-left:0pt;text-indent:-0pt;""><FONT size=""2""><I>Duke Energy has historically made certain lobbying related information publicly
available and has recently enhanced such disclosures.  </I></FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">The Corporation's corporate political contributions and lobbying activities are also subject to regulation by the state and federal government, including
detailed disclosure requirements which are publicly available. Duke Energy is fully compliant with all federal and state laws governing corporate political contributions and lobbying
activities. As a result of the feedback we received from our shareholders during the shareholder corporate governance engagement program, the Corporation has also made changes to how it reports on
contributions and lobbying activities. In 2016, Duke Energy began to disclose all reported lobbying expenses, DUKEPAC contributions and corporate contributions in the aggregate by category on a
semi-annual report which is posted directly on our website at </FONT><FONT size=""2""><I>www.duke-energy.com/our-company/investors/corporate-governance/political-activity-policy.</I></FONT><FONT size=""2"">
Disclosing this information on one report allows the information to be more easily accessed and viewed by our shareholders. The Corporation's lobbying activities and expenditures are also discussed in
our annual Sustainability Report, available at </FONT><FONT size=""2""><I>www.duke-energy.com/our-company/sustainability/reports</I></FONT><FONT size=""2"">. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">Accordingly,
because the Corporation is fully compliant with all federal and state regulations regarding corporate political contributions and lobbying related expenditures and disclosure and, based
on shareholder engagement and feedback, has supplemented our compliance with improved governance and website disclosure, the Board of Directors believes that the additional report requested in the
proposal would result in an unnecessary and unproductive use of the Corporation's resources. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT color=""#376179"" size=""3""><B>For the Above Reasons the Board of Directors Recommends a Vote &quot;AGAINST&quot; This

<mark>Climate Change</mark>: 2 Degree Scenario Analysis  </B></FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2""><B> WHEREAS:</B></FONT><FONT size=""2"">    In November 2016 the Paris Agreement entered into force and its goal of keeping global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius will begin to shape
national policy decisions. To meet this goal the International Energy Agency estimates that the global average <mark>carbon</mark> intensity of electricity production will need to drop by 90 percent. As
long-term shareholders, we would like to understand how Duke Energy is planning for the risks and opportunities presented by global efforts to keep global temperatures within acceptable
boundaries. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">In
June 2016, the credit rating agency Moody's indicated that they would begin to analyze <mark>carbon</mark> transition risk based on scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement, and noted the high <mark>carbon</mark> risk
exposure of the power sector. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">Rapid
expansion of low <mark>carbon</mark> technologies including distributed solar, battery storage, grid modernization, energy efficiency and electric vehicles provide not only challenges for utility business
models but also opportunities for growth. Many large corporations are actively seeking to increase their use of renewable energy, providing a significant market opportunity for forward-thinking
utilities. The International Energy Agency and the International Council on Clean Transportation forecast that electrification of transport will play a critical role in achieving the necessary
greenhouse gas reductions by 2050. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">Duke Energy
is the 2nd largest CO<SUB>2</SUB> emitter in the U.S., has not set a science-based greenhouse gas reduction goal and does not provide information on its long term strategy
or plan to de<mark>carbon</mark>ize in ways that are consistent with the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement or a 2 Degree Scenario. As investors, we are concerned that Duke Energy is not properly accounting for the
risk of its current high investment in <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive generation and is still planning future investments in fossil fuel-based generation. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">A
2 degree scenario analysis of our company's current generation and future plans will generate a more complete picture of current and future risks and opportunities than business as usual planning.
By assessing the impact of a 2 degree scenario on the company's full portfolio of power generation assets and planned capital expenditures through 2040, including the financial risks associated with
such scenarios, the company can better plan for future regulatory, technological and market changes. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2""><B> RESOLVED:</B></FONT><FONT size=""2"">    Shareholders request that Duke Energy, with board oversight, publish an assessment (at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information) of the

Opposing Statement of the Board of Directors:    </B></FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT color=""#376179"" size=""2""><B>Your Board of Directors recommends a vote &quot;AGAINST&quot; this proposal for the following
reasons:</B></FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">Duke Energy takes seriously its responsibility to provide reliable, affordable and clean power for all of its customers and is committed to a cleaner,
smarter energy future by finding new ways to improve energy efficiency and reduce air emissions. The Corporation has worked to modernize its system, and we established voluntary <mark>carbon</mark> reduction goals
in 2010. Since 1999, the Corporation has invested more than $7.5 billion in environmental control equipment to lower emissions from its power plants. The Corporation's <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions
have decreased 28% since 2005 and our <mark>carbon</mark> intensity has decreased from 1.29 pounds per net kWh in 2005 to 0.99 pounds per net kWh in 2015. Although we are the largest utility in the nation, we rank
fifty-fifth in <mark>carbon</mark> intensity at 1120 pounds per MWh according to M.J. Bradley &amp; Associate's 2016 report, Benchmarking Air Emissions of the 100 Largest Electric Power Producers in the
United States. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">We
have announced plans to retire more than 1,800 megawatts of coal generation and invest $4 billion in new, efficient natural gas facilities by 2020. The Corporation has also made substantial
investments in renewable energy, the research and development of battery storage and has introduced a solar rebate program for certain customers in its South Carolina service territory. Since 2007,
the Corporation has invested almost $5 billion to grow its wind and solar power businesses and owns and operates about 2,800 megawatts of renewable generation in more than a dozen states
throughout the United States. In 2016, Duke Energy also announced plans to invest approximately $3 billion more in renewables by 2020. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">Duke Energy
is subject to extensive regulations at both the state and federal levels, including regulation by state and federal environmental agencies, state utility commissions, and the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. State utility commissions have broad powers of supervision and regulation over the Corporation's regulated utilities within their state, which generally includes,
among other things, supervision and regulation of their resource planning, operations, rates, and the terms and conditions of service. Duke Energy's planning process, including its
environmental compliance strategy, is designed to incorporate compliance with all applicable laws and regulations while maintaining the lowest reasonable cost to consumers, as is required by the state
utility commissions. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">Duke Energy's
robust resource planning process addresses many of the concerns contained in the proposal. To best meet its commitments to both customers and investors, the Corporation has been
planning and will continue to plan for <mark>carbon</mark> constraints in the near and long term. Using a scenario planning approach which is disclosed in our Integrated Resource Plans (&quot;IRPs&quot;) that are filed with
and disclosed on the websites of the state utility commissions for the states in which we serve, the Corporation evaluates its generation needs and the infrastructure required to meet forecasted
customer electricity demand based on multiple variables and varying potential stringencies of future <mark>carbon</mark> requirements. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">Finally,
much of the information requested for inclusion in the report is already available in the Corporation's public disclosures. In addition to the disclosures in the Corporation's periodic
reports filed with the SEC and in the IRPs discussed above, the Corporation's annual Sustainability Report includes data on emissions and actions being undertaken to address those emissions. The
Corporation also regularly engages with environmental stakeholders covering a range of topics  including regulatory and policy issues, energy efficiency, and emissions. In fact, in
2016, after engaging in discussions with some of the Corporation's shareholders regarding providing additional information on Duke Energy's forecasting process, the Corporation added additional
information to the Sustainability Report in the article &quot;Planning for the Future&quot; located online which explains how Duke Energy approaches planning for the future, the actions
Duke Energy is taking today to prepare for the type of changes highlighted in the proposal and links to the IRPs for more detailed information. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">In
summary, the Board of Directors does not believe it is in the best interests of the Corporation or its shareholders to prepare such a report at this time due to Duke Energy's efforts
relating to <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions reduction, its resource planning process which considers varying stringencies of future <mark>carbon</mark> constraints, and the Corporation's extensive disclosure included in
various public reports of emissions data, emission reduction results, investments, and significant policy engagement. Developing a separate report as requested in the proposal would be an inefficient
use of Corporation resources and will not add value to the Corporation's current efforts in this area. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT color=""#376179"" size=""3""><B>For the Above Reasons the Board of Directors Recommends a Vote &quot;AGAINST&quot; This

Duke Energy has been investing in new technologies, modernizing its generation fleet to transition to cleaner, more efficient energy sources, expanding the use of energy efficiency and
developing plans to close its coal ash basins. The Corporation also regularly reports on these items in a number of public disclosures. </FONT></P><P style=""font-family:arial;text-align:justify""><FONT size=""2"">The

sulfur dioxide emissions by 86% and nitrogen oxide emissions by 65% since 2005. The Corporation has also announced plans to retire more than 1,800 megawatts of coal generation and invest
$4 billion in new, efficient natural gas facilities by 2020. In addition to its investments to modernize its generation fleet to reduce emissions, the Corporation has also made substantial
investments in renewable energy, including investing almost $5 billion to grow its wind and solar power businesses with plans to invest approximately $3 billion more in renewables by
2020.

It's required under a 2017 state law designed to keep solar power growing in North Carolina.</P><P>Duke expects the rebates to boost home solar installations in North Carolina, which ranks number 2 nationwide for solar capacity.   </P><P>&quot;We think we can double the amount of rooftop solar in North Carolina,&quot; Duke spokesman Randy Wheeless said. &quot;Right now we have a little over 6,000 customers. So we think we can add more than 6,000 - might be closer to 10,000.&quot;   </P><P>Solar in North Carolina grew quickly in part because of a state tax credit.  But that expired in 2015. Wheeless said these rebates could help make up for the loss of the tax credit.  There's also still a federal tax credit. </P><P>Homeowners can get rebates of 60 cents per watt, or $6,000, for solar systems of 10 kilowatts or less. A typical installation of 8 kilowatts would earn a rebate of $4,800.  </P><P>Customers also have the option of leasing solar panels from another company. </P><P>Most solar installations are connected to <mark>Duke Energy</mark>'s power network. If they generate more electricity than needed, it flows onto the network in exchange for credits on their bills.  If the solar panels aren't generating electricity, customers use power from Duke.   </P><P>The program also offers rebates to non-residential customers - up to $50,000 for businesses and up to $75,000 for nonprofit organizations. </P><P>There's a catch: Duke plans to spend $62 million on the program, and rebates will go way when that money runs out, in four years, according to Wheeless.  </P><P>The rebate program is one of several renewable energy initiatives in the works at Duke after the passage of House Bill 589 last year.   </P><P>Another is community solar, sometimes known as shared solar. That's a program for people who don't want or can't have solar panels on their own homes, but want access to solar-generated electricity. The program lets customers subscribe to a nearby community solar farm. State regulators are currently weighing whether to approve Duke's shared solar program. </P><P>Meanwhile, Duke also plans to revive a program it tried out previously, called Green Source Advantage.  It allows large corporate or institutional customers to contract for solar power to offset what they buy from Duke. The company piloted the project in western NC until the trial expired a couple of years ago, announcing deals with big companies including Google's data center in Lenoir. </P><P><STRONG>RELATED LINKS</STRONG></P><P>N.C.

And in many ways, the company still thinks like a 20th century utility.</P><P>Specifically, in its <A href=""https://www.duke-energy.com/_/media/pdfs/our-company/shareholder-<mark>climate</mark>-report.pdf""><EM>2017 <mark>Climate</mark> Report to Shareholders</EM></A>, Duke shares with other utilities a denial of the increasing pace and potential of the transition to renewable energy, along with a preference for centralized conventional power sources, including nuclear generation.</P><P>Even in Duke’s “two-degree scenario analysis”, which rests on the assumption that zero-emitting load following technologies are commercially available, the company still only assumes that hydroelectric power, solar and wind will make up 23% of the generation in its service area, compared to 1% today.</P><P>Duke does not provide a 2050 forecast of the mix for its power generation business, but its 2030 figure shows a mere 10% wind, solar and hydro, which would imply a linear instead of exponential rate of growth, as its portion of wind, solar and hydro has already risen from a less than 1% in 2005 to 5% in 2017.</P><P>Wind and solar globally have seen exponential rates of growth during this time period, not linear. And in looking at future electricity mix for its utility business, BNEF Head of Solar Analysis Jenny Chase echoed<STRONG> pv</STRONG><STRONG>magazine’s</STRONG> perspective in a comment on Twitter.</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""twitter-tweet"" data-width=""550"" data-dnt=""true""><P lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Also &quot;hmmm&quot;, meaning &quot;23% renewables by 2050 is really pretty unambitious even as a business-as-usual scenario&quot;. <A href=""https://t.co/lLK98MfnSn"">https://t.co/lLK98MfnSn</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>In fact, Duke’s projections for the supply of electricity to its utilities show a lower level of renewable energy consumption than <A href=""https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/AEO2018.pdf"">the most recent 2050 projections by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration</A>, which <A href=""https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2018/02/08/eia-downplays-solar-and-wind-in-future-projections-w-chart/"">have been sharply criticized for repeatedly underestimating the growth of renewable energy based on flawed assumptions</A>.</P><P>Duke has its own set of oft-questionable assumptions baked in to its two degree scenario, such as that all of the existing nuclear reactors from which it sources power will be allowed by regulators to operate for more than 20 additional years, pushing plant lifespans as high as 80 years – well beyond the lifespan that any nuclear power plant has seen to date or that such plants were designed for.</P><P>Along with this is the strange forecast that nuclear generation will incrementally increase to 35% of its mix, along with rising demand. This could be the result of Duke making the bizarre assumption that it will build new nuclear power plants despite the economic disaster that conventional nuclear power has become, or an unfounded faith in new nuclear technologies becoming commercially available.</P><P>Another notable assumption is Duke’s expectation that the fall in renewable energy and energy storage prices will continue for another 10 years at a declining rate, and then increase with the cost of inflation. This point may be moot, as large-scale solar is already the cheapest form of generation in many parts of the nation.</P><P>But what may give away Duke’s odd pessimism about the growth of renewable energy is a section where it provides very low estimates about the amount of wind and solar that it can integrate into its mix – even with 13% “load following” zero <mark>carbon</mark> resources. In a passage reminiscent of debunked claims about maximum penetrations of wind and solar, Duke states:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>As the adoption of renewables grows to between 20 and 30 percent of total generation, the value of the resource begins to diminish due to extended periods of excess energy in the spring and fall and insufficient output during the winter months. While energy storage helps to mitigate the periods of excess and lower output, storage alone cannot address the energy deficiency during the winter months.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Even if some of Duke’s questionable assumptions about geographical considerations were correct, assuming such a barrier ignores the ability of Duke to import power to meet demand. Ultimately, it is simply not in line with a host of studies that find that the United States could meet 80% or more of its power from wind and solar by 2050, including a <A href=""https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/52409-ES.pdf"">2012 study by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratories</A> and a <A href=""https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2018/03/01/12-hours-energy-storage-80-percent-wind-solar/"">more recent study led by Ken Caldeira</A>.</P><P>But the missing factor regarding Duke’s pessimism about integrating renewable energy is that by its plans to keep inflexible nuclear generation online well beyond expected plant lifetimes, Duke <A href=""https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2017/09/06/solar-and-nukes/"">will make renewable energy integration more difficult and expensive</A>.</P><P>So while Duke may build some wind and solar – and even acquire solar developers – the company has chosen to keep itself attached to the technologies of the past, and to fight the future.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""entry-author-bio ""><H4>Christian Roselund</H4><DIV class=""author-text ""> Christian Roselund serves as Americas editor at pv magazine, and joined in 2014.

Good thing, since Duke CEO <A href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-fundraising-for-the-dnc-comes-up-short-some-blame-jim-rogers/2012/07/10/gJQARolhbW_story.html"">Jim Rogers has taken the lead</A> on the remaining fundraising for the DNC and is now being criticized for doing a shoddy job of it amid his <A href=""http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/07/14/3383381/blending-duke-progress-now-a-lot.html"">controversial takeover</A> as CEO following a big merger with Progress Energy.



Lost amid this dramatic transition is Duke's ironic role in the <STRONG>American Legislative Exchange Council</STRONG>, or <STRONG>ALEC</STRONG>. ALEC is the infamous <A href=""http://alecexposed.org/wiki/What_is_ALEC%3F"">corporate bill mill</A> that connects notably-conservative <SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline;"">state</SPAN> lawmakers with lobbyists, PR agents and other representatives of companies ranging from Koch Industries to Phillip Morris to Pfizer. ALEC's agenda spans across Big Business priorities, creating template state laws that serve to deny <mark>climate change</mark> science, privatize schools, protect killers (as with the Trayvon Martin &quot;castle doctrine&quot; legislation) and disenfranchise voters through Voter ID laws.<STRONG>Voter ID laws that Democrats call &quot;<A href=""http://www.democrats.org/the-real-cost-of-photo-id-laws"">suppressive</A>,&quot; an ironic contrast to Duke's $10 million line of credit to the DNC.</STRONG>



<mark>Duke Energy</mark> is heavily invested in ALEC in several ways. Duke sponsors ALEC's meetings, dedicates its staff to help oversee ALEC's state operations, and consistently operates in ALEC's anti-environmental task force, a <A href=""../2012/05/10/whats-on-alecs-polluter-agenda-tomorrow/"" target=""_blank"">who's-who of polluters and apologists</A> attacking clean energy legislation that Duke purportedly supports. Here's an overview of Duke's notable role in ALEC:<UL><LI>Duke pays heavily for ALEC's operations--they have <STRONG>spent $116,000 on ALEC meetings since 2009</STRONG>, including $50,000 for ALEC's May 2012 meeting in Charlotte, NC where Duke is headquartered (<A title=""Charlotte Business Journal - Duke ALEC"" href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/print-edition/2012/05/11/duke-buys-in-to-alec-meeting.html?page=all"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Business Journal</A>). This well exceeds the top annual <A href=""http://alecexposed.org/wiki/What_is_ALEC%3F"">ALEC membership fee</A> of $25,000.</LI><LI>Duke representatives <STRONG><A href=""http://www.sseb.org/industry-partnership-associate.php"" target=""_blank"">Chuck Claunch</A></STRONG> and <STRONG><A href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bonnie-loomis/22/7a0/261"" target=""_blank"">Bonnie Loomis</A></STRONG> are liaisons to ALEC's Energy, Environment &amp; Agriculture (EEA) task force, which <STRONG>ghostwrites state laws attacking regional <mark>climate</mark> programs, controls for hazardous coal ash storage, renewable energy standards, EPA enforcement of clean air and water laws, and numerous other polluter handouts</STRONG> written and approved by the oil, coal and public relations companies in the EEA task force's filthy roster. </LI><LI>Progress Energy's<STRONG> Kathy Hawkins </STRONG>and<STRONG> Jeanelle McCain </STRONG>are also involved in ALEC's EEA task force, further bloating Duke's influence within ALEC now that Progress is part of <mark>Duke Energy</mark>.</LI></UL>

Duke has <A title=""Charlotte Business Journal - Duke ALEC"" href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/print-edition/2012/05/11/duke-buys-in-to-alec-meeting.html?page=all"" target=""_blank"">told the press</A> that it doesn't agree with all of the EEA model bills, specifically attacks on renewable energy and reductions in greenhouse gases. This is deceitful, since such laws are at the core of ALEC's anti-environmental task force and have constantly evolved to match changes in political trends. If Duke doesn't support the purpose of this task force, then why is it offering up Duke stafff and money beyond its ALEC membership dues?



Beyond Duke's active participation within ALEC's anti-environmental task force, Duke has also positioned its operatives in two states to help oversee further fundraising and recruitment for ALEC.

<DIV><STRONG><SPAN style=""font-size: medium;""><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Duke and ALEC in South Carolina</SPAN></SPAN></STRONG></DIV><STRONG>Duke's South Carolina Regional Director Chuck Claunch was handpicked by ALEC's State Chairmen in South Carolina</STRONG> to help fulfill their obligations to recruit new ALEC members, raise money, and other responsibilities detailed in ALEC's own <A href=""http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2007/520/140/2007-520140979-04559ea0-9.pdf"" target=""_blank"">IRS tax filings [PDF p.36]</A>. Since Mr. Claunch is also part of ALEC's anti-environment task force, it's possible he helped create model bills that became South Carolina law.Also acting as a private sector co-chair in South Carolina is Progress Energy's Jeanelle McCain, another member of ALEC's anti-environmental task force. With the Duke-Progress merger now made official, it is unclear how Mr. Claunch and Ms. McCain may shift roles, or if Duke's influence in South Carolina is expanding through ALEC.

That and her political work for a company that causes lung damage from coal <mark>pollution</mark>. Just as in South Carolina, Rep. Wolkins and Sen.

So even though <A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-12/rogers-says-u-s-needs-plan-to-wean-off-foreign-oil-video.html"" target=""_blank"">Jim Rogers says we should wean off of foreign oil</A>, Duke conspires with multinational oil companies to attack <mark>climate</mark> solutions.



Typical.



The oil majors are only one example of Duke's secretive partnerships that contradict its <A href=""http://www.duke-energy.com/about-us/category-view.asp"" target=""_blank"">statements</A> on <mark>climate change</mark> and sustainability. ALEC's EEA task force includes operativesfrom <mark>climate</mark> science denying groups like the Heartland Institute,Americans for Prosperity, the Atlas Economic Research Foundation, the Goldwater Institute, and the <A href=""http://www.southernstudies.org/2010/10/blessed-to-have-a-pope.html"" target=""_blank"">John Locke Foundation</A>, all of which have enjoyed <STRONG><A href=""http://www.southernstudies.org/2010/10/a-pope-of-<mark>climate</mark>-denial.html"">support</A> from the billionaire Koch brothers and North Carolina political overlord <A href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_mayer"">Art Pope</A></STRONG>. <STRONG>By participating in ALEC's </STRONG><STRONG>anti-environmental task force, Duke continues to partner with representatives of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE)</STRONG>, a <A href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-grandia/duke-energy-quits-coal-lo_b_275225.html"">front group that Duke abandoned</A> in 2009 when ACCCE's aggressive lobbying against national <mark>climate</mark> legislation became an obvious conflict of interest (and when ACCCE was caught up in a scandal involving <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/08/04/04greenwire-coal-industry-group-linked-to-a-dozen-forged-ca-2624.html?pagewanted=1"">fraudulent letters</A> to Congress opposing <mark>climate</mark> legislation). Let us notforget that national <mark>climate</mark> legislation in 2009 essentially became a <A href=""http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/03/greenpeace-waxman-markey-<mark>climate</mark>-bill-not-strong-enough.php"" target=""_blank"">handout for major polluters like Duke</A> who helped write the legislation.



Greenpeace recently released a new report detailing a <A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/<mark>Climate</mark>-Reports/Apple-Clean-Energy-Road-Map/"" target=""_blank"">Clean Energy Roadmap for Apple</A>, highlighting progress Apple has made in using clean energy sources for its Cloud data centers while stressing that Apple is still far too dependent on coal-burning utilities like <mark>Duke Energy</mark> for its energy. While Greenpeace calls upon Apple to help shift the energy market in a cleaner direction, we are also asking <mark>Duke Energy</mark> to make a dramatic shift away from dirty coal, especially from destructive mountain top removal mining. Responding to Greenpeace, <A href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-57471107-501465/can-apple-change-the-energy-industry-greenpeace-thinks-so/""><mark>Duke Energy</mark> told CBS</A>, &quot;In North Carolina, we are allowed to buy non-mountaintop coal as long as the cost is not higher than conventional coal supply. Even if we wanted to pay more, we couldn't because the state mandates it.&quot;



Come <EM>on</EM>, Duke--you gave money to <A href=""../2012/06/18/is-duke-energy-dictating-the-terms-of-our-democracy/"" target=""_blank"">115 of the 170 North Carolina legislators elected in 2010</A> and spent $19 million on federal and state political contributions during that election cycle alone. You are wrapping up your <A href=""http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/more-officials-called-to-testify-on-duke-energys-boardroom-coup/"" target=""_blank"">scandalous merger</A> into the nation's largest utility company.<STRONG> If Duke wanted to strike down a mandate to use coal from the most destructive sources available, they could do it. Instead, Duke plays to its major strength: using clean PR to hide the dirty money it spends to hold our air, water and <mark>climate</mark> hostage with outdated, 20th Century energy.</STRONG>Amid the sudden ouster of former Progress Energy CEO Bill Johnson and conflicts with ratepayers in multiple states, Duke already has plenty to be embarrassed about. Using ALEC to partner with the world's worst corporate citizens and <mark>climate</mark> science deniers gives Duke's other shames a run for their money.

      Washington, D.C.  —<P>Today is the deadline for coal-fired power plants to post the results of their groundwater monitoring under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 2015 rule regulating the storage and disposal of coal ash. EPA required such monitoring to determine the extent to which coal ash impoundments and landfills were contaminating groundwater. The results confirm the widespread groundwater contamination caused by coal ash around the country. In particular, <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s results reveal startlingly high levels of radioactivity at 11 out of 18 plants.</P><P>Contrary to industry practices, <mark>Duke Energy</mark> did not summarize its groundwater monitoring results in a table, instead burying results in more than 20,000 pages of lab results. Earthjustice Senior Attorney Lisa Evans took a closer look at the data, and found what <mark>Duke Energy</mark> might have been trying to hide: high levels of radioactivity at a majority of its plants.</P><P>“The way <mark>Duke Energy</mark> presented its data showed a clear intent to obscure the findings,” <STRONG>said Earthjustice Senior Administrative Counsel and coal ash expert Lisa Evans</STRONG>. “Despite Duke’s efforts, we found that the data reveal levels of radium in groundwater that far exceed EPA’s drinking water standards and that could clearly harm people who use this water for drinking.”</P><P>This level of contamination is even more concerning considering that EPA’s standard for radioactivity in drinking water, written in 1976, is considered outdated and not as protective as needed. California has released public health goals for radioactive elements in drinking water that are about a hundred times more stringent than EPA’s standard. The Environmental Working Group <A href=""https://www.ewg.org/research/170-million-us-drink-radioactive-tap-water-trump-nominee-faked-"">recently released a study</A> finding that the drinking water of more than 170 million Americans is radioactive enough to increase the risk of cancer.</P><DIV class=""media-element-container style2015 media-story_image_right""><DIV class=""field--name-field-image-credit image-credit"">Graphic by Earthjustice</DIV><DIV class=""image-caption"">Harm to human health from breathing and ingesting coal ash toxicants. <A href=""//earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/coal-ash-man_COMPLETE_2017-07-20_light.pdf"" target=""_blank"">See full infographic.</A></DIV></DIV><P>Levels of radioactivity from radium at the Marshall coal-fired power plant on Lake Norman were 2.5 times the federal drinking water standard. Thallium levels at Marshall also exceeded federal standards and were 18 times higher than the North Carolina groundwater standard. Ash ponds at Marshall are still leaking into surface water and groundwater upstream of drinking water intakes for more than 1 million people in the Charlotte region. Together, these alarming results mean that Marshall ash facilities are much more polluted than previously disclosed.</P><P><STRONG>Sam Perkins, the Catawba Riverkeeper, noted</STRONG>, “This is yet another extremely concerning case of new information about Duke discharging dangerous pollutants from its property. Given Duke’s criminal history and ongoing probation, I am alarmed that Duke has failed to learn from its past mistakes. Duke must take ownership of its problems and stop hiding this information from their neighbors and the millions of people who depend on the Catawba River for drinking water.</P><P>The highest levels of radioactivity were found at <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s Asheville Power Plant, with levels of radium in groundwater 38 times what EPA considers safe for drinking water. “These results confirm that we were right to force <mark>Duke Energy</mark> to commit to removing the coal ash from the leaking ash ponds at their Asheville site,” <STRONG>said Hartwell Carson, the French Broad Riverkeeper</STRONG>. “We need to ensure that Duke’s clean up of the site stops the release of dangerous pollutants to our groundwater.”</P><P>In addition to the alarming levels of radioactivity from radium, the results demonstrate that <mark>Duke Energy</mark> is contaminating groundwater with arsenic, lead, and a host of other toxic pollutants. “Despite the clear evidence that coal-fired power plants such as those owned by <mark>Duke Energy</mark> are endangering lives with their <mark>pollution</mark>, Scott Pruitt’s EPA continues its misguided effort to eliminate even the bare minimum standards,” <STRONG>said Larissa Liebmann, Staff Attorney at Waterkeeper Alliance</STRONG>. “Just last night, EPA released revisions showing its intent to cripple the very rule that requires this sampling and the release of these data.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""earthjustice-master-region earthjustice-master-region--seventh-side""><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-press-contacts flex-blue""><H2 class=""pane-title"">Contacts</H2><DIV class=""pane-content""><P><A href=""mailto:dlisenby@waterkeeper.org"">Donna Lisenby</A>, Waterkeeper Alliance, (828) 297-3777</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

But now the state's largest utility, <mark>Duke Energy</mark>, is fighting back.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-2024dfee-d082-3b11-e390-4f55ff9321ec"">As state regulators review the controversial case, the battle lines are clearly drawn. Advocates at N</SPAN>orth Carolina Waste Awareness and Reduction Network (NC WARN) and members of Faith Community Church support policy change. <mark>Duke Energy</mark> has responded by asking regulators to impose a stiff financial penalty against NC WARN that could threaten to shut down the organization.</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-2024dfee-d082-3b11-e390-4f55ff9321ec"">&quot;The stakes are high,&quot; said Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN, a small nonprofit dedicated to tackling <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/<mark>climate</mark>-change""><mark>climate change</mark></A> by promoting renewable energy.

And the interest is already there: dozens of churches looking to following in Faith Community Church's footsteps have reached out to NC WARN in recent months, said Warren.</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-2024dfee-d082-3b11-e390-4f55ff9321ec"">North Carolina is one of four states with limitations on third-party sales. Earlier this year legislators proposed a bill allowing third-party solar providers in the state, but it failed to get out of committee. Seeing this case as an opportunity, </SPAN><A href=""http://www.solarcity.com/"">SolarCity</A> and other solar proponents including <A href=""http://www.ncipl.org/"">North Carolina Interfaith Power &amp; Light</A> have filed in support of NC WARN's position.</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-2024dfee-d082-3b11-e390-4f55ff9321ec"">But <mark>Duke Energy</mark> argues there is no wiggle room in the existing law, a position shared by the public staff of the Utilities commission, which makes policy recommendations to the commission but is not the same as the seven commissioners who will ultimately vote on this case.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-2024dfee-d082-3b11-e390-4f55ff9321ec"">&quot;The law is clear in North Carolina,&quot; said company spokesman Randy Wheeless. If you want to sell power in the state, that makes you a utility and subject to all the regulations that come with that role. That's why Duke has proposed regulators impose a $1,000 fine on NC WARN for every day its solar panels are connected to the grid. That would amount to more than $120,000.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-2024dfee-d082-3b11-e390-4f55ff9321ec"">Regulators have charged power providers similar daily fines for violations in the past, Wheeless explained.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-2024dfee-d082-3b11-e390-4f55ff9321ec"">Sam Watson, general counsel for the Utilities Commission, told Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News that similar penalties have been imposed, but their circumstances are not similar to this case.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-2024dfee-d082-3b11-e390-4f55ff9321ec"">According to NC WARN's Warren, the group's budget in 2015 was less than $1 million and a large fine would be debilitating.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-2024dfee-d082-3b11-e390-4f55ff9321ec"">&quot;It's a strong attack and ... we have never heard of them doing anything like this in any other state,&quot; Warren said. He added that he believed <mark>Duke Energy</mark> was targeting the group because of its criticism of North Carolina's largest utility in recent years.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-2024dfee-d082-3b11-e390-4f55ff9321ec"">Duke did not respond directly to this charge.

As in steam. Steam produced by a combined heat and power plant that would burn natural gas on the campus of Duke University, but be owned and operated by <mark>Duke Energy</mark>.</P><P>
Duke the utility proposed the project for Duke the university (they share a <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Buchanan_Duke"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">common ancestor</A>) in May as a way to install local generation while helping the host institution heat its classrooms, labs and hospital facilities. If the plant is approved, it could cut the university’s <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by reducing the need to burn natural gas in its campus steam plants.</P><P>
Clean energy advocates on campus and in the region had other ideas. They questioned the accounting Duke used to assess the benefits of the project, and warned that the project would create a long-term addition of fossil fuel infrastructure on a campus committed to <mark>carbon</mark> neutrality by 2024.</P><P>
<mark>Duke Energy</mark>, meanwhile, is hoping to gain experience in the up-and-coming CHP technology for development elsewhere in its territory. CHP works particularly well for college campuses, which have the electrical load and heating needs to justify such projects. Many of those campuses also hold strong public commitments to <mark>climate</mark>-change mitigation.</P><P>
&quot;We definitely see this as a growing business within <mark>Duke Energy</mark>,&quot; <mark>Duke Energy</mark> spokesperson Randy Wheeless said of CHP. &quot;There’s nothing like going to one that's already in existence and operating, and we hope the Duke University one will be that one for us. [...] We want to make sure this one goes correctly.&quot;</P><P>
This proposed 21-megawatt turbine, quite small by power plant standards, has shown the challenges of winning over public support for a new energy asset that's cleaner than traditional gas generation, but not absolutely clean.</P><H2>
More gas for less gas<P>
The proposal developed by the university administration and <mark>Duke Energy</mark> promises several big benefits.</P><P>
The gas plant will capture waste heat from electricity generation and pump it onto campus, making it a more efficient use of gas than traditional generators. That incidental heat source would allow the university to pull back on the natural gas it currently burns in two campus steam plants. A <A href=""https://fmd.duke.edu/documents/Energy%20and%20Water%20Managment/Proposed%20CHP%20final%209-26-16%20-%20FINAL.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">presentation</A> on the topic says getting steam from the CHP project will cut campus natural-gas consumption by a whopping 50 percent, and reduce emissions counted under the <mark>Climate</mark> Action Plan by 18 percent.</P><P>
This tackles a major source of greenhouse gas emissions on campus, as well as avoiding $2.5 million in investments that would otherwise be needed for hot water infrastructure. The university expects a two- to three-year payback.</P><P>
Additionally, having an on-campus power generator serves the resilience of the university’s labs and hospital in the face of grid interruptions like hurricanes or thunderstorms. Diesel backup generators currently serve that role, but gas turbines are generally more reliable machines. <mark>Duke Energy</mark> would need to perform &quot;minor relaying additions and programming&quot; to enable this microgrid application, said Michael Schoenfeld, vice president for public affairs and government relations.</P><P>
A clean alternative like a solar array cannot guarantee backup at night, and pairing energy storage with solar would cost a lot more for this service than the gas turbine will at this time.</P><P>
The administration views resiliency improvement as the top priority in the project, Schoenfeld noted, followed by emissions reductions and cost savings.</P><P>
These benefits come at the expense of a new facility built to burn natural gas, and that on its face conflicts with the institutional drive toward a smaller <mark>carbon</mark> footprint.</P></H2><H2>
Drawing the fence<P>
After the administration announced the plan in May, campus activism forced a pause for additional review. <mark>Duke Energy</mark> asked the North Carolina Utilities Commission to postpone a hearing on the project from Jan. 24 until May, campus newspaper <EM>The Chronicle </EM><A href=""http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2016/12/proposed-campus-power-plant-stalled"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">reported</A>.</P><P>
Some of the concerns centered on the <A href=""http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2016/09/students-and-faculty-question-decision-to-install-duke-energy-power-plant-on-campus"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">internal processes</A>that led to the proposal, and whether or not the campus sustainability bodies were adequately included. The local response also posed a deeper energy question: Should an institution committed to reducing its <mark>climate</mark> impact embrace a fossil fuel technology, even a relatively clean one?</P><P>
In this case, Duke aims to host a gas plant on campus and claim the <mark>carbon</mark> reductions it allows versus existing campus emissions. Since the new plant's emissions come from <mark>Duke Energy</mark>'s business in generating electricity for the grid, the university would count them as part of the emissions factor for purchased electricity, not as emissions originating from campus.</P><P>
A pair of professors from Duke’s Nicholas School of the Environment <A href=""http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2016/10/response-to-the-duke-chp-overview-document"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">argued</A> in <EM>The Chronicle</EM> that the university should account for the plant’s <mark>carbon</mark> emissions when assessing the benefits of the proposal.</P><P>“Under this alternative assumption, the net greenhouse gas emission benefits to Duke University are dramatically reduced, since the <mark>carbon</mark> intensity of electricity produced at the new CHP plant is considerably higher than the <mark>carbon</mark> intensity of the current <mark>Duke Energy</mark> electricity generation fleet,” they wrote in a letter to <EM>The Chronicle</EM>.</P><P>
When factoring in those emissions, plus transmission losses and upstream leakages associated with the additional gas consumption, the professors calculated a net <mark>Climate</mark> Action Plan emissions reduction of less than 4 percent.</P><P>
This debate comes down to a matter of where to draw the boundaries of responsibility. If <mark>Duke Energy</mark> built the plant nearby on land it acquired, and the university bought the steam and burned less fuel, there would be a stronger case for the 18 percent emissions reduction.</P><P>
But that’s not the case here.</P><P>“This plant would not be built without Duke University support,&quot; said sophomore Claire Wang, who runs the Duke <mark>Climate</mark> Coalition. “We tout ourselves as a <mark>climate</mark> leader, and part of that is being responsible for the emissions that we cause.”</P><P>
The administration has asked the Campus Sustainability Committee to evaluate this and other questions about the proposal, and to make a recommendation about how to proceed. They are open to a change in the <mark>carbon</mark> accounting, Schoenfeld said. The hope is to get an answer by May, which would guide the administration's approach to a board of trustees meeting that month. If all goes well for the plan, the utility could then move ahead at the PUC.</P></H2><H2>
Who pays?<P>
The questions facing utility regulators touch on a different set of concerns, specifically the equity of who pays for what.</P><P>
As <mark>Duke Energy</mark>'s first CHP project in the state, this would set a broader precedent that the regulated utility can leverage ratepayer funds for a grid-serving generator that also delivers a specific, localized benefit to a particular customer.</P><P>
Ratepayers will get a deal from the Duke project that's as cost-competitive as more conventional, large-scale gas plants, Wheeless said. The utility would save on cost thanks to &quot;a very attractive lease price&quot; for the campus land, and the university's steam payments will go back to ratepayers.</P><P>
Ratepayers, though, would have to pay $55 million for the ability to create that steam in the first place. The ratepayer dollars going to create a resource for a particular host customer is what sets this apart from typical plant construction.</P><P>
There are some similar cases in the world of microgrids, with an important distinction in payment structure.</P><P>
Arizona Public Service is building <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/distributech-roundup-microgrids-on-the-march"">two microgrids</A>, one at a military base and one at a new data center. The host customer contributes for the resilience benefits in the event of an outage. The microgrids will provide grid power and other services most of the time, so APS asked regulators for permission to rate-base the costs for those services.</P><P>
A <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/distributech-roundup-microgrids-on-the-march"">microgrid collaboration in Denver</A> between utility Xcel Energy and Panasonic includes solar panels and a big battery on the latter's new facility there. Panasonic contributes some of the assets and gets backup power for its operations center; Xcel gets to rate-base its expenses for the assets that will improve grid reliability the rest of the time.</P><P>
Duke, on the other hand, has been piloting a <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/how-dukes-solar-and-battery-powered-microgrid-is-weathering-grid-events"">“utility-controlled, single-customer microgrid”</A> model, and has been able to <A href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2016/11/29/duke-energy-proposes-to-connect-pilot-mount-holly.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">enter costs into the rate base</A> when the microgrid serves the distribution grid, rather than splitting costs with a host client.</P><P>
Now, this Duke project is not a microgrid, yet. That means the only benefit the school gets that the grid doesn't is the heat, which the school will pay for. Critics could still charge that if the utility wants to spend time on projects with a more localized benefit, it should extract more in return for the ratepayers at large.</P><P>
A plant that only served one customer wouldn't be a good candidate for the rate base, Wheeless said, but this is different.</P><P>
&quot;In this case, it's connected to a substation that serves that customer but also serves other people in the community too,&quot; he said. Down the road, if the Dukes pursue the microgrid expansion, they could work out an appropriate cost-sharing agreement on that service.</P><P>
The way the NC Utilities Commission rules on CHP cost sharing will shape the utility's options in paying for projects like this, which will affect its willingness to pursue them. One lesson from this experience is already clear: Rolling out new CHP infrastructure isn't a technical challenge so much as a social one.</P></H2></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

</P><DIV class=""ingested-post-image-caption-wrapper""> Big utility companies are successfully lobbying lawmakers and regulators to restrict individual and corporate access to solar power. Photo credit: Shutterstock</DIV><P>In third-party solar financing, a non-utility company installs solar panels on a customer’s property at little or no up-front cost, sometimes selling the solar energy back to the customer at rates typically lower than a utility would charge.
</P><P><mark>Duke Energy</mark>, the largest utility in the U.S., has so far succeeded in keeping third-party solar illegal in North Carolina, but conservative and liberal factions alike are trying to change that, in different ways.
</P><P>At least four states—<A href=""http://ecowatch.com/2015/10/27/koch-brothers-solar-florida/"">Florida</A>, Kentucky, Oklahoma and North Carolina—currently ban third-party sales of solar energy. Twenty states have murky laws and in the remaining 26, companies are allowed to install solar panels on customers’ roofs and sell energy generated from these panels to the customer. But major electric utilities that burn coal or natural gas are ill-equipped to change their business models to accommodate <A href=""http://ecowatch.com/business/renewables/"">renewables</A>, which explains their frequent opposition to state initiatives that expand solar access.

</P><P><mark>Duke Energy</mark> has claimed that rooftop solar hurts the poor by causing rate increases and has even <A href=""http://www.southernstudies.org/2015/04/duke-energy-called-out-for-targeting-black-communi.html"" target=""_blank"">targeted black leaders</A> with this misleading message.

Although that bill, sponsored by Republican state Rep. John Szoka, died in committee last year, future legislative attempts could face similar opposition from <mark>Duke Energy</mark>.
</P><P>Meanwhile, <mark>Duke Energy</mark> purchased a majority stake in California-based REC Solar, which operates solar projects and sells the energy to commercial customers in other states where third-party sales are legal.

North Carolina lawmakers have also allowed the state’s <A href=""http://www.citizen-times.com/story/money/2016/01/14/tax-credit-sunset-could-dim-solar-business-prospects/78596786/"" target=""_blank"">solar tax credit</A> to expire.
</P><P>Rep. Szoka, a mortgage lender, was stationed at the largest military installation in the country, Fort Bragg, during his career as a Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army. Now representing a district that surrounds the city of Fayetteville and includes Fort Bragg, Szoka first spoke of the military’s energy consumption when explaining why he proposed the bill.
</P><P>Third-party solar sales to the military would save money while increasing energy security, Rep. Szoka argued, noting that on-site power generation would decrease the military’s dependence on the electric grid, which is vulnerable to attacks. Rep. Szoka also says his bill would help the military base to fulfill a <A href=""http://www.seia.org/research-resources/enlisting-sun-powering-us-military-solar-energy-2013"" target=""_blank"">Department of Defense mandate</A> that facilities get 25 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2025.
</P><P>The state representative says there’s a strong free-market argument for third-party solar. “What made America great is free enterprise,” he says. “We need to unleash entrepreneurs in our state to do what they do best.”
</P><P>He also cites private property rights, ratepayer savings and job creation as compelling reasons to legalize third-party solar.
</P><P>Rep. Szoka’s 2015 bill to legalize third-party contracts had wide support from major corporations with business in the state including Wal-Mart, Target, Volvo and Macy’s. These and other businesses wrote a <A href=""http://www.desmogblog.com/sites/beta.desmogblog.com/files/Szoka-Company-Coalition-Letter.pdf"" target=""_blank"">letter to all state legislators</A>, saying that power purchase agreements (third-party sales) would allow them to avoid major up-front expenditures, the risks of operating solar arrays and fluctuating energy rates.

But on Feb. 29, they canceled the announcement because Rep. Mike Hager “reconsidered his position and withdrew his support for … the comprehensive study,” said Szoka.
</P><P>Rep. Szoka had “a long conversation” with Hager this week but hasn’t yet succeeded in changing Hager’s mind.

</P><P>With Hager a vice-chair of the House committee on public utilities and co-chair of the Joint Legislative Commission on Energy Policy, renewables-friendly legislation will continue to face an uphill battle in the North Carolina General Assembly.
</P><P>“Hager and I are on opposite sides of a few energy issues on solar, wind and REPS, but we’re in agreement [a study] is what’s good for the state,” Szoka told DeSmog earlier this month, before Hager cancelled the announcement. “I hope and pray we can negotiate.”
</P><P><STRONG>A Nonprofit’s Civil Disobedience</STRONG></P><P>While Szoka has tried to free North Carolina from utility monopolies via legislation, environmental nonprofits have tried to affect change through activism. Seeking a clarification to state law on third-party financing, NC WARN installed solar panels on the roof of Faith Community Church in Greensboro, selling the electricity to the church at a rate much lower than <mark>Duke Energy</mark> would charge.
</P><P>The case is now before the North Carolina Utilities Commission. NC WARN Executive Director Jim Warren says that the law does not strictly prohibit sales between nonprofits. Additionally, the state constitution prohibits monopolies, he says and <mark>Duke Energy</mark> is just that.
</P><P>Despite <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s calls for <A href=""http://www.southernstudies.org/2015/11/duke-energy-seeks-120k-fine-against-nonprofit-chal.html"" target=""_blank"">a $1,000-per-day fine</A> on the small nonprofit, NC WARN continues defying the energy giant and maintains that it is acting lawfully.
</P><P><A href=""http://ecowatch.com/?s=solarcity"">SolarCity</A>, other solar companies and NC Interfaith Power and Light (represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center) have joined the case as interveners on NC WARN’s side and the Christian Coalition of North Carolina has submitted a letter of support.
</P><P>“It’s tragic and infuriating, at the very time when <mark>climate</mark> science experts are demanding that we begin making big reductions in <mark>carbon</mark>, for <mark>Duke Energy</mark> to use its clout in the wrong direction,” says Warren. “We’re going to continue throwing everything we can at changing their business model. We have no choice.”
</P><P><A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/"">Greenpeace</A> is also standing up to <mark>Duke Energy</mark> and last year <A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/duke-energy-stop-blocking-sun/"" target=""_blank"">protested</A> <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s opposition to rooftop solar outside its annual shareholder meeting.
</P><P>Monica Embrey, who leads Greenpeace’s national campaign on <mark>Duke Energy</mark>, says, “It’s incredibly problematic that <mark>Duke Energy</mark> is denying access to homeowners, churches, schools and small businesses while reaping all of the benefits for itself … Everyone deserves access to solar and renewable energy options.”

I went there to see how the state’s regulatory rollback is playing out so far.</P><P>My trip brought me to the home of Amy Brown, who lives with her husband and two sons in a small single-story home in Belmont, not far from Charlotte. Inside, bottled water is stacked in corners and against the walls. Her boys, ages 11 and 4, use the bottled water to brush their teeth. Brown uses it to make them oatmeal in the morning and spaghetti at night. That’s because the Browns’ well water contains elevated levels of a carcinogen called hexavalent chromium and another potentially dangerous compound called vanadium. In 2015, the state advised the family and their neighbors not to drink the water or cook with it.</P><P>The Browns live a few hundred yards from a coal-fired power plant, the Allen Steam Station, and it is this plant, according to some environmentalists and homeowners, that is polluting the local well water. <mark>Duke Energy</mark>, which runs that power plant and 13 others in the state (seven of which, including Allen, still burn coal), disagrees.</P><P>Burning coal creates a residual material called coal ash, which some environmentalists say contains dangerous levels of heavy metals; <mark>Duke Energy</mark> contests the allegation that coal ash is hazardous. Duke stores its coal ash in pits near plants where it still burns coal and those where it formerly burned it. At many <mark>Duke Energy</mark> sites, including Allen, the coal ash is mixed with water and stored in unlined pits—essentially ponds—where, environmentalists say, the mixture seeps into the groundwater. Area wells then act like straws, they say, pulling up the polluted water into households like the Browns’.</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote instapaper_ignore"">“It’s like our state is deaf, and the only voice they can hear is <mark>Duke Energy</mark>.”</ASIDE><P>But whether it’s the coal ash that is polluting the drinking water is a matter of dispute. <mark>Duke Energy</mark> says that coal ash is not what’s responsible for the contamination, and it points to an October 2016 study from Duke University that <A href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2016/10/26/duke-university-study-duke-energy-coal-ash-ponds.html"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'521211'"">concluded</A> that, though the coal-ash ponds are potentially polluting groundwater near the pits, the hexavalent chromium that is contaminating the well water is naturally occurring.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-3""><P>North Carolina regulators have embraced <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s version of events, environmentalists say, and have slowed down efforts to get the company to address <mark>pollution</mark> problems near coal-ash sites.  Cleanup was further set back, they say, after Republicans gained control of the North Carolina legislature in 2010 and then practically came to a halt when Pat McCrory, who had worked for <mark>Duke Energy</mark> for 28 years, won the race for governor in 2012.</P><P>In an effort to become more business-friendly, the state favored industry over environmental organizations, critics say. The McCrory administration was “very quick to cater to whatever special interest would come forward with an idea to roll something back; they were enthusiastic about it,” Chuck McGrady, a moderate Republican state legislator who favored environmental protections, told me.</P><P>Over the last five years, the state’s GOP leadership consistently cut resources from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (renamed the Department of Environmental Quality in 2015). Former department staffers said the cuts made it extremely difficult to carry out their jobs. And however the drinking water was contaminated, the state confused residents like Brown about its safety, playing down the health risks and pushing back against directives from health officials that instructed families not to drink their tap water.</P><P>Even after a massive coal-ash spill from a <mark>Duke Energy</mark> plant polluted 70 miles of the Dan River in North Carolina in 2014, the state was wishy-washy on coal-ash cleanup, ultimately passing a bill that allowed the company to leave many of its coal-ash sites in place as long as the company made repairs to the basins and provided a supply of clean drinking water to households located near coal-ash sites.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-4""><P>And so, Brown and her family still live on bottled water, she still hustles her husband and children through the shower, and they never take baths. The Browns’ in-ground pool, which has elevated levels of arsenic, among other chemicals, is strictly off-limits. “It’s like our state is deaf, and the only voice they can hear is <mark>Duke Energy</mark>,” Brown told me.</P><P class=""dropcap"">o<SPAN class=""smallcaps"">ne of Governor McCrory’s</SPAN> top priorities when he was elected in 2012 was to make the state more business-friendly. “The reason I’m running for governor is to represent business,” he said<A href=""http://www.ashevilledailyplanet.com/component/content/article/2811-mccrory-touts-business-friendly-tack-to-fix-nc"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'521211'""> while campaigning</A>.

One of Skvarla’s first actions was to rewrite the mission statement of DENR so that a cost-benefit analysis was applied to environmental matters whenever possible. The new mission statement also emphasized that personnel should be a “resource of invaluable public assistance” rather than a “bureaucratic obstacle of resistance.” Links and documents about <mark>climate change</mark> also<A href=""http://www.wral.com/<mark>climate</mark>-change-links-vanish-from-denr-website/13470340/"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'521211'""> disappeared</A> from DENR’s website once Skvarla took over.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-5""><P>Beginning in 2013, DENR staffers were instructed to focus on customer service, the “customers” being permit-seeking businesses, said Amy Adams, who worked at the department from 2004 to 2013, most recently as a regional-office supervisor. Staffers were no longer sure if they were even supposed to be doing enforcement actions, a range of tactics the state can deploy to compel corporate compliance with the law. “There was a new push to work with and handhold corporations rather than hold them accountable to the level that we always had before,” Adams said.</P><P>At the same time, the state began slashing DENR’s resources and consolidating departments. The number of full-time employees at the department fell from 5,221 in January 2010, to 4,053 in January 2012, to 1,685 in January 2016, according to the state, although many of these employees were transferred, along with the work they did, to other departments. Since 2013, a total of 69 compliance and enforcement positions were eliminated in the department, according to Jamie Kritzer, a Department of Environmental Quality spokesman.</P><P>The reduced staff numbers made it hard for DENR to conduct inspections to make sure permits were being followed, Adams said. Enforcing permits and fixing violations is a difficult process to begin with, but with fewer and fewer workers, it became nearly impossible. Resources were put into issuing permits, not enforcing them, she said. Adams, for instance, supervised an area covering 21 counties’ worth of wetlands and streams, and after the Republicans took over, her staff shrank from six people to two. “There really was this overall feeling of: ‘We don’t send violations; we’re not going to do enforcement. We’re going to be customer-friendly, service-friendly,’” she said.</P><FIGURE style=""max-width: 630.0px;""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption"">A man delivers bottled water to Amy Brown’s house in Belmont.

She wrote an<A href=""http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/under-the-dome/article10287251.html"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'521211'""> op-ed</A> in Raleigh’s<EM> News &amp; Observer</EM> that criticized the “soul-crushing” takeover of the department by “politically and ideologically motivated lawmakers.” Staffers “are under great pressure to essentially trust the industry’s word that everything is in order,” she wrote, likening the system to a fox guarding the henhouse. “‘Do more with less’ has become the mantra of upper management, but we in the ranks heard the message loud and clear: ‘Do less. Period.’”</P><P>Skvarla responded to Adams with his own op-ed, saying her article was full of “emotion, hyperbole, and conjecture.” Then he defended DENR’s new business-friendly approach. Under his supervision, the department had been turned from “North Carolina’s No. 1 obstacle of resistance into a customer-friendly juggernaut,” he wrote. “This is progress!”</P><P class=""dropcap""><SPAN class=""smallcaps""><SPAN style=""font-variant-caps: normal; text-transform: none;"">P</SPAN>ower companies have</SPAN> been burning coal and disposing of its waste for decades. The plants themselves have become much cleaner over time, but in recent years, environmentalists have begun to worry about the dangers of byproducts like coal ash. In 2008, a dike failure at the Kingston Fossil Plant in Tennessee dumped 5 million cubic yards of coal ash into waterways, destroying nearby homes and focusing national attention on the substance.</P><P>Coal ash contains low levels of arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and a collection of other metals. There is some dispute over what level of exposure to these materials is acceptable: The group<A href=""http://www.psr.org/assets/pdfs/coal-ash-hazardous-to-human-health.pdf"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'521211'""> Physicians for Social Responsibility</A> says that prolonged exposure to coal ash can cause cancer and other diseases. <mark>Duke Energy</mark> counters that coal ash contains only very low levels of these elements and that anything can be toxic at high levels. The Environmental Protection Agency in 2014 <A href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/12/19/371952760/new-epa-standards-label-toxic-coal-ash-non-hazardous"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'521211'"">designated coal ash</A> a nonhazardous waste.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-7""><P>Until recently, there were few regulations governing how coal ash was stored, and many energy companies, including <mark>Duke Energy</mark>, routinely put coal ash into wet basins near their power plants—Duke has 31 such ponds in North Carolina. The ash settles at the bottom of the ponds, and the water on the top of the pond is cleaned and then filtered into nearby waterways. Federal law now requires that ponds with potential structural issues be closed over the next decade, and Duke says it plans to close all of its ponds by 2029.</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote instapaper_ignore"">“Instead of enforcing the law, the state was … working hand in glove with Duke, as a way to stop citizen law enforcement.”</ASIDE><P>In the meantime, the way that <mark>Duke Energy</mark> has discharged the water from its coal-ash basins over the last few years has caused controversy in North Carolina. Companies receive permits that govern how they dispose of the byproducts of burning coal, and in 2011, the Southern Environmental Law Center looked into whether <mark>Duke Energy</mark> was following its permits. The group alleged that Duke was in violation of its permits under the Clean Water Act, because it was discharging polluted water contaminated by coal-ash toxins into nearby rivers and streams in areas where it didn’t have permits to do so. Duke disagreed, saying it believed it had complied with all applicable permits.</P><P>The Clean Water Act allows citizens’ groups to file lawsuits against companies violating the law, but it requires them to file a 60-day notice to state regulators first. In 2013, the Southern Environmental Law Center filed one such 60-day notice, saying it planned to sue <mark>Duke Energy</mark> for violations of the Clean Water Act at a power plant in Asheville. The plant had been allowed, by permit, to discharge treated wastewater at one location, but it was releasing water contaminated by chemicals from coal combustion—including barium, cobalt, iron, and manganese—at other locations, the complaint said.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-8""><P>But on the 59th day of the 60-day period, right before the Southern Environmental Law Center was going to file its lawsuit, the state stepped in. North Carolina said it was taking its own enforcement actions against the plant, which meant that the organization was prevented from suing <mark>Duke Energy</mark>. The same thing happened when the Southern Environmental Law Center filed another 60-day notice for a Clean Water Act violation at another plant: At the 11th hour, the state stepped in and said it was doing its own enforcement, and the center once again could not sue <mark>Duke Energy</mark>.</P><P>The Southern Environmental Law Center alleges that the state was intervening not to hold Duke accountable, but to stop the environmentalists’ lawsuit from proceeding. Even after stepping in, the state procrastinated on investigating potential <mark>pollution</mark> at coal-ash sites and on requiring Duke to address water-quality issues, Frank Holleman, a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center, told me. “Instead of enforcing the law, the state was using this tool, working hand in glove with Duke, as a way to stop citizen law enforcement,” he said. “It was a way to circumvent Duke having to clean up coal-ash <mark>pollution</mark>.” (A new governor was elected in North Carolina in November, and the people who were in charge during the time period this story covers are no longer in office. The current administration said it would not comment on actions taken by the previous administration, but that it was working with the Southern Environmental Law Center and other environmental groups “to find acceptable solutions to protect public health and the environment from coal ash.”)</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-9""><P>Later in 2013, after a series of public-records requests, the center found that the state and <mark>Duke Energy</mark> were collaborating on how to proceed.

But after looking into the state’s efforts at Buck, District Judge Loretta Biggs in 2015 allowed the lawsuit to continue. It did not seem that the state “was trying diligently or that its state enforcement action was calculated, in good faith, to require compliance with the [Clean Water] Act,” she wrote. The state had been supposedly litigating its enforcement action for two years, the judge found, but it had taken no depositions or filed any motions requiring Duke to clean up its sites.

Their house has an in-ground pool, where the family used to have big parties every summer. And the neighborhood feels more rural than its proximity to Charlotte—just 30 minutes away without traffic—would suggest. The Browns weren’t concerned that the house was just a stone’s throw from <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s Allen power plant: Such plants have been outfitted with emissions technologies that make them much cleaner than they used to be, and Brown said she barely noticed the plant. “It’s not like I can see a big, ugly, nasty pit through the trees,” she told me.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-14""><P>But then, in late 2014, in the wake of the Dan River spill, the Browns received a postcard in the mail telling them they could have their water tested because they lived near a coal-fired power plant. They agreed to have the testing done, and in April 2015, they received the results. The well water, the testing showed, contained elevated levels of vanadium, which can cause lung damage and symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, stomach cramps, breathing difficulty, and eye, throat, and skin irritation. Brown’s water was found to have 6.8 parts per billion of vanadium; the state recommended a maximum level of 0.3 parts per billion. Subsequent testing also found elevated levels of hexavalent chromium, a carcinogen made famous by Erin Brockovich, who investigated levels of that chemical in the water in Hinkley, California. Brown’s water had 2.2 parts per billion of hexavalent chromium; the state’s recommended maximum level was 0.07 parts per billion.

The Environmental Protection Agency, in coming up with rules on the disposal of coal ash, documented more than two-dozen proven “damage cases” where coal-ash ponds had contaminated groundwater and surface water with chemicals, including arsenic, cadmium, and chromium. The agency listed three sites in North Carolina.</P><P>Yet whether the substance is contaminating drinking water is a matter of dispute. It can be difficult to determine the direction that contaminated groundwater is traveling—to do so requires expensive tests that include sinking wells in various locations and testing the water pulled from those wells, Parentau told me. “When it comes to toxicology, that’s an incredibly technical thing to establish,” he said.</P><P>Avner Vengosh, a professor of geochemistry and water quality at Duke University, told me that his team had spent 10 years studying coal ash in the South. In the case of North Carolina, he said, they found that coal ash was potentially polluting the groundwater but not the water in wells. “It polluted groundwater that is not used for drinking,” he told me. The homeowners with elevated levels of chemicals were seeing those elevated levels because of factors unrelated to coal ash, he said. The Southern Environmental Law Center says a separate study from scientists at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, has found that drinking-water wells near the Allen Plant, where Amy Brown lives, are indeed drawing groundwater contaminated by coal ash. But an author of that study, William Langley, said it was a draft that modeled a worst-case scenario that may not represent what is actually happening on the ground.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-16""><P>Whatever the source of the contamination, families probably shouldn’t drink the water, and most people in North Carolina agree on one thing: The state did not do a good job of communicating the health risks to residents. That’s because, in addition to recommending that the homeowners avoid drinking their water, letters from the state also contained a line that read, “While this recommendation represents the maximum in health protection, your well would still meet all the criteria of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act for public drinking water sources.” But this was misleading: The water met federal standards only because there is no federal Safe Drinking Water Act standard for vanadium, and while there are such standards for total chromium, they do not specifically address levels of hexavalent chromium. Meanwhile, the water did not meet standards calculated by the state health department for hexavalent chromium, which used the threshold of a one-in-a-million cancer risk—essentially the presence of one additional case of cancer during a lifetime in a population of a million people.</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote instapaper_ignore"">The McCrory administration was essentially countermanding public-health officials’ judgment over what levels of chemicals in the water should be considered troubling.</ASIDE><P>The letters about the water “were very poorly handled,” McGrady, the moderate Republican legislator, told me. “I don’t think anyone in the state thinks the state handled that well.”</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-17""><P>According to former state toxicologist Ken Rudo, the line that the water met federal standards was added by state environmental regulators against the wishes of state health-department staff, which had been pressured to downplay the risks of drinking the water.

But just as he was about to send out those letters, he later testified, the state contacted him and wanted him to add a line telling people the water was safe to drink. Rudo and his colleagues objected—because of “ethical reasons more than anything,” he said in the deposition—and said if the state were to send out such language, he wanted his name taken off the letter. The state added the line anyway, when he was on vacation, Rudo said in the deposition. “They added language basically saying this was the maximum risk, literally right after we are telling people not to drink their water,” he said. “And it was just amazing, misleading, and dishonest language.”</P><P>In 2015, McCrory appointed a new deputy secretary in the state’s Department of Health and Human Services, Randall Williams, who pushed back against the staff recommendations on the levels of chemicals that could safely be in the water. Williams thought that the standards the state health department had used to issue the do-not-drink letters were too conservative, and he had the department send out another round of letters telling well owners that their water <EM>was</EM> safe to drink. “Now that we have had time to study and review more data, we have concluded that it is appropriate to return to drinking and using your water for cooking and other uses,” the letter read.

These rules specify that recommendations for groundwater contain no more than a one-in-a-million increase in the risk of cancer, she said, which is how the environmental agency’s toxicologists came up with the number 0.07 parts per billion for hexavalent chromium. Soon after Reeder and Williams published their letter attacking Rudo, Davies resigned. In her resignation letter, she reminded the state that other departments had approved of the way Rudo had calculated the water standards, and she accused Reeder and Williams of misinforming the public. “I cannot work for a Department and an Administration that deliberately misleads the public,” she wrote.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-19""><P class=""dropcap""><SPAN class=""smallcaps"">After the Dan River</SPAN> spill and the controversy over the drinking water, some state legislators redoubled their efforts to get <mark>Duke Energy</mark> to clean up its coal-ash basins.

In 2014, the state passed the Coal Ash Management Act, which McCrory claimed was at the forefront of such legislation nationwide. That law required Duke to evaluate all its coal-ash basins across the state. The Department of Environmental Quality was then required to review Duke’s evaluations and rank the sites as presenting high, intermediate, or low risk, which would in turn determine whether they’d be excavated or capped.

The Tennessee Valley Authority is planning to close and cap 10 coal-ash ponds at power plants in Tennessee and Alabama. The Environmental Protection Agency also requires that coal-ash ponds that are closed and capped be monitored to make sure they aren’t having an adverse affect on the groundwater, according to Jim Roewer, the executive director of the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group, a trade association that handles solid- and hazardous-waste issues for the utility industry.</P><P>But the legislation disturbed some lawmakers in both parties. McGrady, who helped craft the original legislation, voted against it. “It basically said that everything that was left was going to be capped in place, which included some of the biggest basins out there,” he told me. Harrison said that the bill “was a gift to the governor and his administration, and to <mark>Duke Energy</mark>.”</P><P>Amy Brown told me she was disappointed but not surprised when the bill passed. The law means that, despite regulators’ initial recommendations to excavate the coal-ash pits, <mark>Duke Energy</mark> can instead drain the ponds and cap the dry pits. All that Duke has to do now is fix some dams and provide the Browns and other families across the state with an alternative supply of water. “It was a way for them to look like they’re doing something for us, but in return, they still get what they wanted,” she said.</P><P>Although <mark>Duke Energy</mark> contends that its coal-ash pits are completely safe and that it has safely handled its coal-ash sites across North Carolina, in January it sent out a “goodwill” package to homeowners like the Browns who live near coal-ash sites. It offered each household $5,000 and volunteered to make up for lost property values if people were trying to sell their homes and found their property was selling below market rates. It also said it would subsidize their water bills if they connected to public water lines.</P><P><mark>Duke Energy</mark> says it is offering the package to homeowners to help “ease their transition” to a new water supply. Neighbors are concerned about having a water bill they’ve never had before, Sheehan said, and the company is trying to address those concerns. “We wanted to be responsive to concerns of long-term residents,” Sheehan told me.</P><P>But there’s a catch. If residents accept the goodwill packages, they must agree not to sue <mark>Duke Energy</mark> or seek additional compensation over water-quality issues. It is this requirement that has led Brown and other homeowners to question Duke’s intent.

Earlier this month, in a <A href=""http://www.eenews.net/assets/2017/04/13/document_gw_04.pdf"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'28',r'521211'"">letter</A> to the president of the Environmental Council of the States, Pruitt said that his agency plans to reconsider a rule that establishes limits for some of the toxins and heavy metals discharged by coal-ash sites and that the agency seeks to push back a 2018 compliance deadline.  </P><P>If North Carolina is any indication, the country could see an Environmental Protection Agency with less regulatory verve and an environment with more <mark>pollution</mark>, said Longest. “The same fate may befall the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as befell the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources—a demoralized and decimated workforce and a public left to fend for itself,” he said.</P><P>Some members of the public have taken seriously the responsibility of fending for themselves, stepping in to hold <mark>Duke Energy</mark> accountable when they felt the state did not. Groups like the Southern Environmental Law Center battled <mark>Duke Energy</mark> repeatedly in court, and they continue to do battle with the state, even though the fight over coal ash has gone on for more than five years. Anyone who wants to influence environmental policy can’t just trust their government, Holleman told me. “Environmental laws will be adequately enforced, and our natural resources will be protected,” he said, “only if citizens and nonprofit citizen organizations take direct action and insist in the public arena and in the courts that our water and our air be protected.”</P><FIGURE style=""max-width: 630.0px;""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption"">A coal-ash pit at the Dan River Steam Station in North Carolina (Gerry Broome / AP)</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>That’s what Amy Brown did. Once she learned that her water was not safe to drink, she started making phone calls. She called the state, <mark>Duke Energy</mark>, and local reporters. After a month, she had convinced Duke to provide her with bottled water every few weeks—before they began doing so statewide. When she found out that Duke wasn’t providing bottled water to her neighbors, she started going door to door, giving her neighbors a phone number to call, a person to nag. The truck started delivering water to the whole neighborhood.</P><P>The blue Dasani bottles are stacked everywhere—on her kitchen counter, next to the brown leather couch where her son watches television, outside under the carport, and next to a sign in her front lawn that reads, “Clean Drinking Water for All.” In many places, the stacks of water are taller than her 4-year-old.</P><P>What she has learned, Brown said, is not to trust anyone but herself. “We get comfortable and assume that these people in these positions are doing their job, which is to act in the best interest of the people,” she said. “But that’s just not the case.”</P><P>It is partly because of people like Brown that McCrory lost his reelection to Roy Cooper, a Democrat, in November 2016. Cooper campaigned hard on the coal-ash issue, <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w3s_5RgmQI"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'29',r'521211'"">running ads</A> about the controversial “do-not-drink” letters and about the spate of resignations from state departments.

She supported Cooper in the election. “I started to realize the connection between the big companies and the Republicans,” she said. “They would rather protect the polluter than the people.”</P><P>Brown is now a full-fledged activist and is constantly on the phone with reporters, neighbors, and other families who live near coal-ash sites. Her young son has learned to wait patiently while she sits at her kitchen table poring through documents relating to coal ash. She despairs that he’s growing up in a household where he can’t take a bath and where he can’t drink the water. “You don’t even know that you need protection until you’ve had to fight for it,” Brown told me. It's something that millions of Americans may discover for themselves in the years ahead.</P></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Industry leaders from a wide variety of sectors, all spoke to urgency with which we should be discussing <mark>climate change</mark> in the business world, the critical importance of addressing <mark>climate change</mark> through appropriate pricing of <mark>carbon</mark>, and to pursuing innovative new business models and technologies to help decrease emissions.</P><P>Speakers continuously made the case that by economic standards alone, <mark>climate change</mark> is one of the most pressing business challenges and opportunities of our generation. Tiiram Sunderland, a consultant from Bain’s London office, argued for requiring sustainability education in business schools, as core business decisions will be fundamentally impacted by a changing environment in our 30+ year careers. Another panelist stated that <mark>climate change</mark> is as impactful a disruption on global business as automation and deserves more attention.</P><P>Given the fervor over artificial intelligence and blockchain, this comparison resonated with the MBA audience.</P><P>GSEI students walked away energized by the panel of investors who spoke about the importance of ESG (environment, social, governance factors) in investing. The panel emphasized the necessity of including <mark>climate</mark> risk and <mark>carbon</mark> emissions in financial disclosures as tools to provide investors with all the information they need to make the best decisions. Fundamentally, they all supported a price on <mark>carbon</mark> to help facilitate market based solutions to addressing <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The conference did a great job addressing <mark>climate</mark> issues across industries-- in the real estate break out, for example, the panel debated the key levers with which the industry can address <mark>climate change</mark>. Like all sectors, changes in important market signals, such as insurance rates, is required to change the status quo of development. All the panelists agreed that companies are pursuing projects that in the long term view do not make sense- think beach side property in Miami- but that in the short term provide a return so lucrative that there is no incentive to avoid them.</P><P>The day concluded with two seasoned leaders, Lord Michael Hastings, Global Head of Corporate Citizenship, KPMG International and Jim Rogers, the Former CEO and Chair of <mark>Duke Energy</mark> discussing the ways in which <mark>climate change</mark> realities present leadership opportunities for MBA students. Mr. Rogers told a compelling story of how, as a CEO of a large energy company, he helped write policies aimed at limiting <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, despite this being a very unpopular decision with his board and industry. His understood that even unpopular decisions that were forward thinking and pragmatic could help him stay ahead if handled correctly. Lord Hastings explained that though it took more than one attempt to convince his company to take sustainability seriously, he won them over because, “you cannot afford to ignore <mark>climate change</mark>, your ability to do business will be affected.”</P><P>With 42% of Fortune 500 companies run by MBAs, <mark>Climate</mark>CAP was a comprehensive and fun conference to help ensure this pressing issue is addressed head on by our future leaders.

Their cheerful announcement also casts natural gas in a familiar light — as the clean, <mark>climate</mark>-friendly fuel of the future.</P><P>“This combination provides clear benefits to our customers and the environment as we continue to expand our use of low-cost and clean natural gas and invest in pipelines,” <mark>Duke Energy</mark> CEO Lynn Good said in <A href=""https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/n-c-utilities-commission-approves-duke-energy-s-acquisition-of-piedmont-natural-gas"" target=""_blank"">a statement</A>. </P><P>These days, terms like “clean” and “low-cost” come standard with efforts to tout the environmental and economic benefits of natural gas relative to other energy sources. By now, they should also set off alarm bells.</P><P>One of the nation’s largest electric providers, Duke has brought four natural gas-fired power plants online in North Carolina since 2011 to replace shuttered coal-fired capacity. Earlier this year, the company received <A href=""http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/2016/01/25/new-duke-natural-gas-plant-new-concerns/79288696/"" target=""_blank"">expedited approval</A> of plans to convert a fifth, its Asheville plant, from coal to gas. </P><P>A similar story is playing out in other states where Duke operates. Florida, which ranks third in solar potential but 14th in installed capacity, relies on gas to meet two-thirds of its electricity demand. Duke subsidiary Progress Energy operates several gas-fired facilities in the Sunshine State, including the 1,912-megawatt Hines Energy Complex.</P><P>Other large investor-owned utilities aren’t far behind. Florida Power &amp; Light, also among the nation’s largest electric utilities, and Duke are partners in the controversial $3.2 billion <A href=""http://www.newsweek.com/natural-gas-pipeline-southeast-sabal-trail-transmission-496418"" target=""_blank"">Sabal Trail Pipeline</A>, which will stretch nearly 500 miles from Alabama to central Florida. </P><P>Duke based its decision to purchase the Charlotte-based Piedmont on sustained market trends that forecast a continued expansion of natural gas’ role in the nation’s energy mix. The pivot toward gas is especially pronounced in the eastern U.S., with Duke at the forefront of a historic fuel switch.</P><DIV id=""attachment_84924"" style=""width: 235px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Earlier this year, Duke received expedited approval of plans to convert its Asheville plant from coal to gas, the fifth plant to switch fuels since 2011. Click to enlarge.</P></DIV><P>And the trend shows no signs of slowing down. Duke’s most recent long-term <A href=""http://starw1.ncuc.net/NCUC/ViewFile.aspx?Id=0707e812-b29f-4d0e-8974-d215cb3a6e87"" target=""_blank"">resource plan</A> proposes constructing three plants that would add nearly 2,500 megawatts of gas-fired generation in the Carolinas. The plan also calls for multiplying installed solar capacity threefold by 2031, but says solar’s “limited ability to meet peak demand conditions” makes more gas generation essential to ensure reliability.</P><P>“A thoughtful transition is what we are seeking, not a headlong rush to dependency on any one fuel,” Duke’s director of integrated resource planning, Glen Snider, <A href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2016/09/02/duke-energy-sees-less-coal-more-renewables-and.html"" target=""_blank"">told</A> the <EM>Charlotte Business Journal</EM>.</P><P>Fair enough. Duke often claims credit for diversifying its portfolio ahead of the curve, although North Carolina’s renewable energy standard and tax credits for renewables have played a considerable role. But today, the company’s large stake in the $5 billion proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline threatens to counteract that thoughtful transition. If the 550-mile pipeline is built, Duke’s gas-burning power plants would be among its primary users.</P><P>Continuing to invest in massive pipelines designed to last decades could result in <A href=""http://www.utilitydive.com/news/eyes-wide-open-despite-<mark>climate</mark>-risks-utilities-bet-big-on-natural-gas/426869/"" target=""_blank"">stranded assets</A>, costly liabilities created when capital-intensive projects like pipelines or power plants are forced to retire before the end of their economic usefulness. This is especially true if the United States plans to do its part to meet international <mark>climate</mark> goals. </P><P>“We’ve been building gas power plants like crazy for the last 10 years,” Lorne Stockman, the author of <A href=""http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2016/07/bridge_too_far_report_05_web_Finalv2.pdf"" target=""_blank"">a report</A> on gas infrastructure for the group Oil Change International told Utility Dive. “I don’t see anyone really sitting down and saying how many more can we build if we are really going to make this transition.”</P><P>Replacing existing gas capacity with renewables may be unlikely in the near-term. But that doesn’t make the long-term planning decisions being made today any less problematic, because they foreshadow an energy future that experts are urging us to avoid.</P><DIV id=""author-meta""><DIV class=""about-author"">About </DIV><P>Brian is an environmental news junkie concerned with our lagging energy policy and revealing the true cost of coal on our health, the environment and the <mark>climate</mark>.

Last summer, I sifted through thousands of archival pieces at the University of Texas and conducted interviews with stakeholders who have an interest in subsurface property[1] conversations in Texas. Because of the Fellowship, I can spend about an hour or more every morning analyzing the data that I collected from this past summer and contextualizing my findings within larger conversations that theorize about property. Similarly, I am using some of the fellowship money to present my initial findings at a regional conference in Texas, where I am meeting with other energy geographers interested in property rights debates. By staying engaged with local collaborators, I can keep my project relevant and connected to those for whom the findings are most germane, as well as maintain local contacts that can help distribute my findings to property owners across the state. Finally, with the extra time, I have been able to investigate new methods to incorporate into my research, such as courthouse documents and innovative survey methodologies.</P>
[1] I use “mineral property/owner/estate” and “subsurface property/owner/estate” interchangeably.<P><STRONG>Why is this research important?</STRONG>At the most basic level, my research examines property rights in Texas—however, not just any property rights, but rather subsurface property ownership. Subsurface ownership is complex in that property relations are clearly defined yet the level of “privacy” is dependent on state and national policy objectives. For example in every state, the subsurface can be “severed” from the surface estate and treated as a separate, transferrable property. In essence, that means that the proprietor owns an estate that they will never see—a piece of property that is below the surface—but can use that ownership tenure to compel other property owners in the same “column” of property to relinquish part of their rights. Oftentimes, the rights to the subsurface supersede surface, water, and other property rights, which facilitate the extraction of hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s at the expense of non-mineral estate owners. Through policies enacted during “energy independence” movements in the 1970s, some mineral properties can be forced into lease agreements without compensation through rulings issued by state hydro<mark>carbon</mark> regulatory bodies. Texas accounts for 37% of oil and 26% of domestic natural gas production, and consequently serves as an ideal case study for interrogating how U.S. national/state energy policies on “energy independence” intersect with property. My research seeks to uncover three related themes: first, who are the subsurface owners in the state of Texas? Second, how do mineral owners think about their properties? Third, why do they decide to drill for oil and gas? By answering these questions, we, as researchers, can begin to probe how individual decisions on property ownership relate to broader themes such as energy independence, petroleum exports, hydro<mark>carbon</mark> reserve estimates, economic development, and <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>Why is this fellowship important to you?</STRONG>At a basic level, this awarding of this fellowship excites me, because it indicates that there is a broader interest in learning more about mineral estates. There has been a big focus on surface property ownership in the academic literature, but for a variety of reasons, few researchers have explored the importance of subsurface property ownership.</P><P>More intrinsic to my personal interests, I am using this fellowship as a way to investigate something that I have been curious about since I was child. When I was very young, my family and I moved from Fort Worth, Texas, to a small suburban llama ranch 30 miles outside the city. One night, I remember as a teenager looking out my window and peering at a sea of ten-story drilling rigs that filled the eastern horizon and whose light flooded my bedroom with the vigor of a midnight sun. The subsurface manifested itself as a spire of men and metal that mechanically and systematically thrust pipe, water, sand, and gels thousands of feet into the subsurface with a racket so deafening my family could barely sleep despite being half a mile away. Lacking subsurface property rights, my family listened powerlessly as the natural gas extracted directly benefited someone completely unfamiliar to me—the mineral owner. I do not fault the mineral owner for choosing to extract the hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s; no doubt, the opportunity for financial gain was significant.</P><P>But the curiosity has plagued me ever since: how did my family loose our ability to benefit from this extraction and why did the natural gas well that snaked under my family’s property not directly benefit my family?

Scientists explain that a loss of arctic ice caused by a warming atmosphere weakens wind patterns that normally keep the arctic air mass farther north. That change allows arctic air to come farther south, thus the record lows in North Carolina even as the overall atmosphere is warming. That brings us to the irony of <mark>Duke Energy</mark> citing the blast of extra cold air as a reason to increase the burning of fossil fuels that cause global warming.</P><P>The 600-mile <A href=""https://atlanticcoastpipeline.com/about/default.aspx"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Atlantic Coast Pipeline </A>will originate in West Virginia, travel through Virginia and then continue south into eastern North Carolina, ending in Robeson County. That pipeline advocates focus on a short-term issue – a spike in natural gas prices – is part of a broader failure to respond to long-term patterns. And the failure is especially true of <mark>Duke Energy</mark>, the nation’s largest electric utility, and Dominion Energy of Virginia, a partner in proposing the pipeline.</P><P>The pipeline would help <mark>Duke Energy</mark> to build new natural gas-powered plants and perhaps create more industrial customers for the utility. That will help <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s stockholders now, but it’s not a sound approach to tomorrow. The future is in alternative energy, much of it generated on site. Building pipelines and natural gas plants that transport fuels and electricity over long distances is a path back to the 20th century.</P><P>This isn’t a perspective limited to wind and solar energy advocates. Jim Rogers, <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s former president, has urged the utility to accelerate its transition to alternative energy. And major suppliers of the electric power industry are making changes that affirm that traditional power-plant operations are already disappearing.</P><P> In December, General Electric Co., the world’s largest maker of gas turbines, said it plans to cut 12,000 jobs in its power business, in part because of the growth in renewable energy. That followed a November announcement by Siemens, a major German manufacture of power plant turbines, that it would lay off 6,100 workers before 2020 in its power and gas division.</P><P>“The power generation industry is experiencing disruption of unprecedented scope and speed,” Siemens management board member Lisa Davis told Reuters. “With their innovative strength and rapidly expanding generation capacity, renewables are putting other forms of power generation under increasing pressure.”</P><P>Institutional investors, concerned about <mark>climate change</mark>, are threatening to withhold investments in the world’s top greenhouse gas emitters that are not moving away from fossil fuels. The <A href=""https://www.top1000funds.com/news/2017/12/19/investors-launch-<mark>climate</mark>-action-100/"" target=""_blank"" title="""">initiative</A>, called <mark>Climate</mark> Action 100+, was announced in December and involves 225 investors representing $26.3 trillion in investment funds.</P><P>“Money talks. If we can deploy capital and the power of financial markets, we can ensure [these] companies make the transition needed to cap global warming,” says Anne Simpson, investment director of sustainability at the $323 billion California Public Employees’ Retirement System.</P><P><mark>Duke Energy</mark> said in a statement that it is making the transition, but its emphasis is on diversifying its power sources, not converting them: “Renewable energy plays an increasingly important role in our generation mix, and we are committed to growing this resource in our state. But as it is an intermittent technology that is currently only available when the sun is shining, we also need a diverse energy mix.”</P><P>Jim Warren of NC WARN, a utility watchdog group that has long challenged <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s pricing, <mark>pollution</mark> issues and plans for new plants, has turned his criticism to a kind of helpful cajoling. He opposes the Atlantic Coast Pipeline as a potential burden on ratepayers and an environmental hazard, but he also sees it as not in <mark>Duke Energy</mark>’s best interests. If the utility doesn’t aggressively convert to alternative energy sources, he said it risks being locked into an obsolete business model and ratepayers may have to cover the losses.</P><P>“It’s this old guard mentality thinking the monopoly will support them, but the ground is shifting under everybody’s feet,” Warren said. “We’ll find out if they are agile enough to make that transition.” He added, “Right now they are going headlong in the wrong direction.”</P><P>That transition requires a change the utility probably can’t bring itself to make: abandoning plans for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.</P><DIV class=""ng_endnote_contact""><P>Barnett: 919-829-4512, or nbarnett@newsobserver. com</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

That’s why President Barack Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency is moving quickly to put the finishing touches on a new set of regulations, called the <A href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/05/obama-<mark>carbon</mark>-rules-coal-plants-<mark>climate</mark>-epa-<mark>climate</mark>-plan-explainer"" target=""_blank"">Clean Power Plan</A>, that aim to reduce the nation’s overall <mark>carbon</mark> footprint 30 percent by 2030 by cracking down on emissions from the energy sector.</P><P>Unsurprisingly, many power companies—particularly those that rely on coal as their main source of fuel—are crying foul. Recently, one major coal company and a dozen coal-reliant states tried to block the new rules in federal court. (The court <A href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/04/why-gops-attack-obamas-<mark>climate</mark>-plan-will-probably-fail"" target=""_blank"">decided last month not to hear the challenge</A>, since the rules haven’t yet been finalized.) And this week, executives from two of the country’s biggest power companies met with White House officials in an attempt to persuade them that the crackdown would be <A href=""http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/power-plant-cuts-too-much-too-soon-utilities-tell-wh/article/2568071"" target=""_blank"">“too much too soon.”</A></P><DIV class=""pullquote-right"">The power companies protesting President Obama’s <mark>climate</mark> plan also produce the most <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>.</DIV><P>As it turns out, those same two companies—<mark>Duke Energy</mark> and American Electric Power—emit more <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> than any other power producers in the country. That’s according to a new <A href=""http://www.ceres.org/resources/reports/benchmarking-air-emissions-of-the-100-largest-electric-power-producers-in-the-unites-states-2015/view"" target=""_blank"">report</A> released from a coalition of environmental groups and power companies, which draws on public data from the EPA and the Energy Information Administration to reveal the <mark>carbon</mark> footprints of the 100 biggest power producers in the nation. Many of the names in the database, like AEP or California’s Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, might be familiar from your monthly bill, depending on where you live. The list does leave out some big utilities, like New York’s Con Ed, that primarily distribute power they purchase wholesale from someone else. That said, the database offers a pretty comprehensive snapshot of the companies most responsible for producing <mark>climate</mark>-changing emissions in the US.</P><P>The chart below shows the top 10 <mark>climate</mark> offenders from the database, according to two different metrics, and where each company ranks nationwide in terms of total power production. The first chart shows total <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions in 2013. Unsurprisingly, that list is comprised mostly of the country’s biggest power companies, such as Duke, <A href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/03/<mark>carbon</mark>-capture-coal-plant-EPA-mississippi"" target=""_blank"">Southern</A>, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. These companies produce a huge amount of power, and much of it comes from coal. Duke, for example, gets <A href=""http://www.duke-energy.com/pdfs/byb-generation-mix.pdf"" target=""_blank"">about 45 percent</A> of its power from coal; for AEP, it’s <A href=""http://www.aep.com/about/majorbusinesses/powergeneration/"" target=""_blank"">about 60 percent</A>.</P><P>The second chart shows the companies that are the most <mark>carbon</mark>-intense—that is, the companies that emit the most <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide per unit of electricity generated. Many of these are small, regional producers that rely almost exclusively on coal. While these companies generate relatively little power overall, what they do generate is exceptionally dirty, <mark>climate</mark>-wise. <A href=""http://www.bigrivers.com/power-production/"" target=""_blank"">Big Rivers Electric</A>, for example, provides power for a patch of western Kentucky with four coal-fired plants, the newest of which came online in 1986. Big Rivers declined to comment for this story. But a spokesperson for Great River Energy pointed out that the dataset may not fully represent a company’s portfolio, because it accounts only for power plants that the companies own and not for contracts with third-party wind and solar farms.</P><DIV class=""inline inline-center"" style=""display: table; width: 1%""><DIV class=""caption"">Tim McDonnell/<mark>Climate</mark> Desk</DIV></DIV><P>Take another look at the top chart. You might have noticed that while many of the country’s largest power producers appear on the list of major <mark>carbon</mark> polluters, a few big names are absent. That’s important, and it illustrates the huge <mark>climate</mark> benefit of using low-<mark>carbon</mark> fuels. In some cases, these companies have avoided significant <mark>carbon</mark> emissions because their energy generation portfolio is made up mostly of nuclear (which practically zero-<mark>carbon</mark>) and/or natural gas-fired plants (which release relatively little <mark>CO2</mark>). For example, the nation’s number-two power producer is <A href=""http://www.exeloncorp.com/assets/newsroom/downloads/docs/fact%20sheet_ExelonCorporation%202015.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Exelon</A>, which gets 59 percent of its power from nuclear. The number-four producer, <A href=""http://www.nexteraenergy.com/pdf/profile.pdf"" target=""_blank"">NextEra</A>, gets 52 percent of its power from natural gas, 27 percent from nuclear, and 16 percent from wind. In other words, the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint ranking is essentially a proxy for which power companies are most reliant on coal.</P><P>There’s some good news in the data, as well. In the last few years, nationwide coal use has dropped precipitously. That’s mostly a product of market forces, rather than environmental regulation: Natural gas, made cheaper by the fracking boom, has displaced coal in power plants across the country. At the same time, renewable energy sources have boomed.</P><DIV class=""pullquote-left"">The report illustrates the huge <mark>climate</mark> benefit of power companies switching from coal to cleaner fuels.</DIV><P>“What you see in this report is a significant shift to cleaner fuels,” said Derek Furstenwerth, a contributor to the report and the director of environmental services at Calpine, one of the country’s biggest power companies. Like NextEra, Calpine gets the bulk of its power from natural gas. Calpine has also emerged as a major proponent of Obama’s <mark>climate</mark> plan.</P><P>The shift away from coal has had a significant impact on emissions: Since 2008, <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions from the power sector have dropped 12 percent. Other types of air emissions reported in the database are also way down, driven by regulations from the EPA that took effect prior to the Obama years. Emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide (both of which cause acid rain and other nasty environmental impacts) are down 74 percent and 80 percent, respectively, since 1990. The trends in those emissions offer a bit of a crystal ball into what will happen when the federal limits on <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions kick in, said Dan Bakal, a contributor to the report and director of the electric power program at Ceres, a group that tracks environmental issues in the private sector.</P><P>“At the time, industry really thought [reducing NOx and SO2 emissions] was not going to be achievable and that it would be much more costly,” he said. “But they stepped up to the challenge and found ways to reduce emissions very cost-effectively. The same thing will happen with <mark>CO2</mark>.”</P><P>Just because <mark>carbon</mark> emissions are already on the decline, doesn’t mean Obama’s rules are unnecessary. The change isn’t happening fast enough to avert dangerous <mark>climate change</mark>, Bakal said. But the current trend does show that cleaning up the power sector is possible.</P><P>Complying with the Clean Power Plan “will be a bit of a stretch for the industry, which is appropriate for a regulation intended to put us on an improving path,” Furstenwerth said. “But we believe that it’s definitely achievable.”</P><P><EM>The chart above has been revised for greater clarity.</EM></P></ARTICLE><FOOTER class=""entry-footer""><SECTION id=""mj-article-bottom-membership-widget-3"" class=""widget mj-article-bottom-membership-widget""><H3>FIGHT DISINFORMATION:</H3><P><STRONG>Disinformation is one of the biggest threats our democracy faces.</STRONG> Like our reporting on dark money, it is one of those stories behind all the other stories.</P><P><STRONG>So we want to build a team dedicated to tracking and exposing the forces behind disinformation as a new reporting priority before this fall's midterms.</STRONG> But to do it, we need to raise $100,000 that we didn't plan on before June 30.
