This new body of data confirms the conclusions of the most recent report by the IPCC<SUP>4</SUP>(2007) on future changes in temperature and rainfall. By 2100, average global temperatures are expected to rise by 3.5 to 5°C according to the most unfavorable scenario, or 2°C according to the most optimistic projections. This study has been made available to the international community, and will be used by the IPCC in its next report, to be released in 2013. It provides information on likely <mark>climate</mark> conditions and trends at the end of the century and, for the first time, over the next 30 years as well.</H2><DIV id=""textContenu""><P>The IPCC was formed for the purpose of gathering and summarizing all the available scientific information on <mark>climate change</mark>, its impact and solutions for countering or adapting to it. The first section of its fifth report, to be published in mid-September 2013, will give an update on the new findings compiled in recent years. Just as for the 2007 edition, the international scientific community has joined forces, in particular through the WCRP (World <mark>Climate</mark> Research Programme), to define and carry out an exercise to simulate past and future <mark>climate</mark> conditions, called the CMIP-5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project).</P><P>This ongoing research effort, which requires vast resources in terms of manpower, computing power and data storage capacity, involves more than 20 climatology centers around the world and the development of some 50 numerical models. In France, many organizations are contributing to the project, in particular through the CNRM, in association with CERFACS and IPSL.</P><P>The CMIP-5 project introduces a number of <mark>innovation</mark>s in relation to the previous exercises:</P><UL><LI>The inclusion of scenarios that incorporate <mark>climate</mark> policies intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; 
</LI><LI>The use of models that are both more complex (for the better integration of factors like aerosols, the <mark>carbon</mark> cycle, etc.) and more precise (for better resolution); 
</LI><LI>An in-depth evaluation of the models' capacity to reproduce past <mark>climate</mark> conditions and the mechanisms that underlie their evolution; 
</LI><LI>A series of “retrospective forecasts” for the past 50 years, as well as a preliminary forecast exercise for the period between 2010 and 2035.</LI></UL><P><STRONG>Findings of the French simulations</STRONG>In keeping with the IPCC's conclusions of 2007, all scenarios predict a trend toward higher temperatures between now and 2100. The severity of the rise varies depending on the scenario under consideration, reaching 3.5 to 5°C for the most unfavorable but only 2°C for the most optimistic — a scenario that depends on the successful implementation of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, it seems that natural factors alone cannot explain the average global warming observed since the second half of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century.</P><P>The new simulations confirm an intensification of the hydrological cycle<SUP>5</SUP> and the rapid melting of the Arctic sea ice. According to the most pessimistic scenario, the Arctic Sea will be totally ice-free in the summer by 2040 or 2060, depending on the model.</P><P>Some new responses are offered by the simulations coupling <mark>climate</mark> to the <mark>carbon</mark> cycle. In particular, they make it clear that anthropogenic emissions must be rapidly reduced in order to reach “negative” emissions (i.e. a level of anthropogenic activity that makes it possible to draw CO<SUB>2</SUB> directly from the atmosphere) by the end of the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century.</P><P>The analyses of this set of simulations, in combination with simulations by other international research groups, will shed new light on the link between human activity and <mark>climate change</mark>, both in the past several decades and, more importantly, in the decades and centuries to come.</P><DIV style=""width:358px;"" class=""ImageBoite""><P class=""ImageCopyright"">© Patrick Brockmann (LSCE/IPSL, CEA/CNRS/UVSQ)</P><P class=""ImageLegende"">Changes in the Earth's surface temperature for the period 2071-2100 compared with the period 1971-2000, calculated using the CNRM-CERFACS and IPSL models for scenario RCP4.5 (moderate).</P></DIV><DIV class=""notes""><H3>Notes: </H3><P>1 - Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace, uniting six environmental science laboratories, four of which participate in <mark>climate</mark> modeling projects: LATMOS (CNRS / UPMC / UVSQ), LMD (CNRS / ENS / UPMC / Ecole Polytechnique), LOCEAN (CNRS / UPMC / MNHN / IRD) and LSCE (CNRS / CEA / UVSQ).

(The IPCC, along with Al Gore, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for its work on synthesizing the research on <mark>climate change</mark>. We believe it to represent the most authoritative consensus view of current science regarding <mark>climate change</mark>.)
<P>We summarize our reading of the IPCC’s 2007 Fourth Assessment Report on <A href=""http://www.givewell.org/shallow/<mark>climate</mark>-change/impacts"">this page</A>. Briefly, we find that unmitigated <mark>climate change</mark> would have extraordinarily negative humanitarian impacts across all of the outcomes we looked at: hunger, water stress, flooding, extreme weather, health, biodiversity, and the economy. Successfully mitigating these negative impacts would carry vast humanitarian benefits.</P><P>When looking at the range of possible futures outlined in the report, the bulk of the variation (in humanitarian terms) comes from variation in the level of assumed economic growth and adaptation, rather than variation in the amount of <mark>climate change</mark>. Of the outcomes we examined, only biodiversity is expected to be unambiguously worse off in the future as a result of both <mark>climate change</mark> and economic growth. <A href=""http://www.givewell.org/shallow/<mark>climate</mark>-change/impacts"">More here</A>.</P></LI><LI>Because of some of the dynamics of <mark>climate change</mark>, extreme but unlikely <mark>climate change</mark>s contribute disproportionately to the total expected harm of <mark>climate change</mark>. We summarize our understanding of these dynamics and give some examples of how extreme <mark>climate change</mark>s could be particularly catastrophic on <A href=""http://www.givewell.org/shallow/<mark>climate</mark>-change/extreme-risks"">this page</A>. Many of these potentially extreme outcomes are not well-captured by the models described in our main page on <mark>climate</mark> impacts (which is based primarily on the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report), suggesting that that page likely underestimates the total expected damages from <mark>climate change</mark>. <A href=""http://www.givewell.org/shallow/<mark>climate</mark>-change/extreme-risks"">Our page on extreme risks</A> also discusses some of the approaches to dealing with extreme <mark>climate change</mark> that may be different from the overall approaches to <mark>climate change</mark> discussed on the rest of this page. <A href=""http://www.givewell.org/shallow/<mark>climate</mark>-change/extreme-risks"">More here</A>.

We have identified several sources that provide estimates of the amount of nonprofit or foundation funding devoted to addressing <mark>climate change</mark>:
</P><UL><LI>According to the Foundation Center, U.S. foundations granted roughly $900 million to <mark>climate change</mark> issues in 2008, with more than half of the funding coming from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.<A class=""see-footnote"" id=""footnoteref1_k2okwlu"" title=""  See chart “Foundation Giving for <mark>Climate Change</mark>, 2000 to 2008,” Pg 3, in Steven Lawrence, “<mark>Climate Change</mark>: The U.S. Foundation Response”  "" href=""#footnote1_k2okwlu"">1</A> Based on this source, 2008 appears to have been an outlier because of a one-off transfer from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to the <mark>Climate</mark>Works Foundation.
</LI><LI>Matthew Nisbet, a professor at American University in Washington, D.C., estimated that U.S. environmental groups spent $394 million in 2009 on <mark>climate</mark> and energy efforts, while the opposing coalition of conservative groups and industry associations spent $259 million in the area.<A class=""see-footnote"" id=""footnoteref2_1k9f1mk"" title="" &quot;In Chapter 1, to better understand the influence of money and spending in the debate over cap and trade legislation, I reviewed the nature, composition and funding sources of the major national environmental groups working on <mark>climate change</mark> and compared these factors with the opposing coalition of conservative think tanks, advocacy groups and industry associations. Then, analyzing data compiled from tax returns, annual reports and other sources,  I systematically compared the revenue and forms  of spending by both sides in the <mark>climate change</mark> debate.  Overall, in 2009, the most recent year for which data is available, the major conservative think tanks, advocacy groups and industry associations took in a total of $907 million in revenue, spent $787 million on all program-related activities, and spent an estimated $259 million specific to <mark>climate change</mark> and energy policy. In comparison, the national environmental groups took in $1.7 billion in revenue, spent $1.4 billion on program activities, and spent an estimated $394 million on <mark>climate change</mark> and energy-specific activities.&quot; Matthew C. Nisbet, “<mark>Climate</mark>shift: Clear Vision For the Next Decade of Public Debate” pg iii. "" href=""#footnote2_1k9f1mk"">2</A></LI><LI>A 2012 report by the Environmental Grantmakers Association indicated that roughly 21% of all environmental grants made by U.S. foundations in 2009, totaling about $330 million, went towards <mark>climate change</mark> and energy issues.<A class=""see-footnote"" id=""footnoteref3_dk419ec"" title="" Environmental Grantmakers Association, “Tracking the Field, Volume 3: Exploring Environmental Grantmaking”: “<mark>Climate</mark> &amp; Atmosphere received more support overall in 2009 than it did in 2007, and moved from the seventh most granted issue (at 9.6% in 2007) to the second most granted issue (at 20.8% in 2009), all while still receiving proportionally less from the philanthropic community as a whole than it received from EGA members. ” Pg 11. Table 5, page 15, indicates that 2009 overall giving in the <mark>climate</mark> area was $215,298,518 while giving to energy was $114,246,650, totaling $329,545,168 across the broader <mark>climate change</mark> sector. $329,545,168 divided by total environmental giving ($1,582,970,825) = 20.82%.  "" href=""#footnote3_dk419ec"">3</A></LI></UL><P>We do not have a good sense of the methodology for any of these reports, and even the most recent ones describe the situation in 2009, so they may already be meaningfully out of date. Based on these reports and an off-the-record conversation, we would estimate that typical annual philanthropic spending on <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation in the U.S. is likely in the range of a few hundred million dollars.</P><P>Of course, philanthropic funding (and American philanthropic funding at that) makes up only a portion of all of the funding globally devoted to addressing <mark>climate change</mark>. We have not seen any estimates of global funding levels across sectors, but U.S. federal government reports seem to indicate that they spend roughly $8 billion a year on <mark>climate change</mark> efforts, mostly (~$6 billion/year) on developing technology to reduce emissions.<A class=""see-footnote"" id=""footnoteref4_mkqwktm"" title=""  Congressional Research Service, “Funding for Federal <mark>Climate Change</mark> Activities, FY2008 to FY2012:” “In sum, OMB and agencies have identified approximately $70 billion available to federal agencies from FY2008 through FY2012 for <mark>climate change</mark> activities. The large majority – about 80% -- has funded technology development and deployment, mostly through the Department of Energy (DOE).” Pg 1. Table 2, Page 4, shows $5.6 billion in funding for <mark>climate change</mark> technology, almost all through the Department of Energy, in fiscal year 2012. Table 5, Page 7, shows $8.3 billion in funding for <mark>climate change</mark> programs overall in fiscal year 2012. 2010 and 2011 had $8.8 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively, in overall <mark>climate</mark> program funding.

</P><OL><LI>most philanthropic funding focused on <mark>climate change</mark> goes towards the strategy of encouraging government adoption of policies to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark>, with the <mark>Climate</mark>Works Foundation playing a particular notable role with around $150 million in spending in 2011.<A class=""see-footnote"" id=""footnoteref5_bgjm9yy"" title=""  <mark>Climate</mark> Works 2011 Annual Report, page 45.

</LI><LI>geoengineering research receives relatively little funding, from either government or philanthropic sources.<A class=""see-footnote"" id=""footnoteref7_bs1e5t5"" title=""   According to the Government Accountability Office, the U.S. federal government funded about $100 million of research relevant to geoengineering over FY 2009 and FY 2010, but only $1.9 million of that was spent directly investigating particular geoengineering approaches. There is no coordinated federal geoengineering research effort: “USGCRP agencies reported funding at least 52 research activities relevant to geoengineering in fiscal years 2009 and 2010. We found that, of these 52 activities, 43 were either related to conventional mitigation strategies or were fundamental scientific research, whereas 9 directly investigated a particular geoengineering approach. We identified approximately $100.9 million in geoengineering-related funding across USGCRP agencies in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, with about $1.9 million of this amount related to research directly investigating a particular geoengineering approach. The other roughly $99 million was related to research concerning conventional mitigation strategies that could be applied directly to a particular geoengineering approach or basic science that could be applied generally to geoengineering. However, there is no coordinated federal strategy or operational definition for geoengineering, so agencies and policymakers may not know the full extent of relevant federal research.” GAO, “<mark>Climate change</mark>: A Coordinated Strategy Could Focus Federal Geoengineering Research and Inform Governance Efforts.” Pg 18. The only dedicated source of philanthropic funding for geoengineering research that we're aware of is the Fund for Innovative <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy Research, funded by Bill Gates (not the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation) and administered by professors Ken Caldeira and David Keith, which has distributed $4.6 million in grants since 2007. “Fund for Innovative <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy Research”   "" href=""#footnote7_bs1e5t5"">7</A></LI></OL><DIV class=""toc-back-to-top""><A href=""#toc"">Back to Top</A></DIV><H2 id=""Questions_for_further_investigation"">Questions for further investigation</H2><P>Our research in this area has been relatively limited, and many important questions remain unanswered by our investigation.</P><P>Amongst other topics, our further research on this cause might address:

Seaweed farms release <mark>carbon</mark> that maybe buried in sediments or exported to the deep sea, therefore acting as a CO<SUB>2</SUB> sink. The crop can also be used, in total or in part, for biofuel production, with a potential CO<SUB>2</SUB> mitigation capacity, in terms of avoided emissions from fossil fuels, of about 1,500 tons CO<SUB>2</SUB> km<SUP>−2</SUP> year<SUP>−1</SUP>. Seaweed aquaculture can also help reduce the emissions from agriculture, by improving soil quality substituting synthetic fertilizer and when included in cattle fed, lowering methane emissions from cattle. Seaweed aquaculture contributes to <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation by damping wave energy and protecting shorelines, and by elevating pH and supplying oxygen to the waters, thereby locally reducing the effects of ocean acidification and de-oxygenation. The scope to expand seaweed aquaculture is, however, limited by the availability of suitable areas and competition for suitable areas with other uses, engineering systems capable of coping with rough conditions offshore, and increasing market demand for seaweed products, among other factors. Despite these limitations, seaweed farming practices can be optimized to maximize <mark>climate</mark> benefits, which may, if economically compensated, improve the income of seaweed farmers.</P></DIV><DIV class=""JournalFullText""><H2>Introduction</H2><P class=""mb15"">With an annual production of 27.3 million tons in 2014 and a growth rate of 8% year<SUP>−1</SUP>, seaweed aquaculture now comprises 27% of total marine aquaculture production. Still the value of the seaweed produced only amounts to 5% of the total value of aquacultural crops (<A href=""#B20"">FAO, 2016a</A>). Looking at the process chain of seaweed from production through processing to final products, the growth of the actual seaweed production lags behind the demand of biomass for the many traditional and novel applications for this expanding crop (<A href=""#B54"">Mazarrasa et al., 2014</A>; <A href=""#B6"">Callaway, 2015</A>). Further expansion of seaweed aquaculture will require development of a skilled labor force and new technologies to occupy additional suitable areas for farming. Also a diversification of applications will make the industry more resilient to impacts derived from shifting demands from specific industries. A closer synergy between further expansion of seaweed aquaculture and the development of novel demands for this crop will be essential to continue to fuel the growth of this emerging blue industry (<A href=""#B54"">Mazarrasa et al., 2014</A>). Compensating farmers for the role of seaweed production in <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation and adaptation need also be considered. Indeed, an increased contribution of seaweed aquaculture to <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation and adaptation requires that seaweed production continues to grow. However, further growth of seaweed production may drive market prices down, in turn discouraging farmers from engaging in this activity. Thus, providing economic incentives associated with the benefits for <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation and adaptation may be instrumental in supporting increased seaweed production into the future.</P><P class=""mb15"">Seaweed production, both from wild stocks and from aquaculture, represents an important conduit for CO<SUB>2</SUB> removal from the atmosphere, with strongly autotrophic seaweed communities globally taking up 1.5 Pg C year<SUP>−1</SUP> via their net-production (<A href=""#B41"">Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016</A>). Yet, the potential of managing seaweed production to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark> by sequestering CO<SUB>2</SUB> has not yet been fully incorporated into the emergent concept of <I>Blue <mark>Carbon</mark></I>, referring to <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation strategies based on the capacity of marine plants to bind CO<SUB>2</SUB> (<A href=""#B61"">Nellemann et al., 2009</A>; <A href=""#B56"">McLeod et al., 2011</A>; <A href=""#B18"">Duarte et al., 2013</A>). The reason for such neglect is the belief that the large majority of seaweed production is decomposed in the ocean and therefore, does not represent a net sink for CO<SUB>2</SUB>. However, this view has been recently challenged (<A href=""#B32"">Hill et al., 2015</A>; <A href=""#B81"">Trevathan-Tackett et al., 2015</A>; <A href=""#B58"">Moreira and Pires, 2016</A>) and new evidence suggests that seaweeds are globally-relevant contributors to oceanic <mark>carbon</mark> sinks (<A href=""#B41"">Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016</A>). Hence, the contribution of seaweed to <I>Blue <mark>Carbon</mark></I> and <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation strategies is now being reconsidered.</P><P class=""mb15"">One pathway to broaden <I>Blue <mark>Carbon</mark></I> strategies to incorporate the CO<SUB>2</SUB> sink capacity of seaweeds is to manage the fate of seaweed production, whether derived from aquaculture or harvest of wild stocks, to reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions derived from fossil fuel use. This can be achieved, for instance, through the use of seaweed biomass as biofuel directly replacing fossil fuels (e.g., <A href=""#B39"">Kraan, 2013</A>; <A href=""#B9"">Chen et al., 2015</A>), and/or replacing food or feed production systems with intense CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission footprints by seaweed-based food systems, which have much lower life-cycle CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission (<A href=""#B25"">Fry et al., 2012</A>). Indeed, a seaweed-based <I>Blue <mark>Carbon</mark></I> program has been developed in Korea (<A href=""#B10"">Chung et al., 2013</A>; <A href=""#B76"">Sondak and Chung, 2015</A>), providing an initial step in this direction. Yet, Korea contributes only 6% of global seaweed aquaculture production (<A href=""#B21"">FAO, 2016b</A>), so the development of seaweed farming as a <I>Blue <mark>Carbon</mark></I> strategy for <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation would require that major producers, such as China accounting for more than half of the global seaweed aquaculture production, engage with this strategy.</P><P class=""mb15"">The development of seaweed farming as a strategy for <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation would help alleviate present constraints on the further growth of seaweed aquaculture. Growth of seaweed production is exceeding that of traditional markets, leading to a steady decline in price at about 1–2% year<SUP>−1</SUP> (<A href=""#B44"">Kronen et al., 2013</A>), deterring farmers and investors from engaging. Economic compensation for the environmental benefits brought about by seaweed farming, including its role in <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation, would allow for further growth and a more <mark>sustainable</mark> seaweed aquaculture industry. In particular, economic compensation for <mark>climate</mark> services associated with seaweed farming would help generate a new market for seaweed production while also creating incentives to reduce further the life-cycle CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions of seaweed aquaculture.</P><P class=""mb0"">Here we outline the potential to develop seaweed <I>Blue <mark>Carbon</mark></I> Farming as a strategy for <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation and adaptation. We do so by first assessing the potential, based on wild and aquaculture production, and the pathways for this production to be managed as to result in avoidance of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions while possibly generating <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation co-benefits. We then evaluate the role of seaweed aquaculture in adaptation to specific impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> in the marine environment, such as ocean acidification, deoxygenation, and shoreline erosion (e.g., <A href=""#B27"">Gattuso et al., 2015</A>). Finally, we propose a number of actions required to consolidate such program as a component of the pathway to solutions for <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation and mitigation.</P><H2>Global Seaweed Production and the Associated CO<SUB>2</SUB> Uptake</H2><P class=""mb15"">Seaweed communities are strongly autotrophic, generating far more organic matter through photosynthesis than consumed by respiration in the ecosystem, and are thus responsible for much of CO<SUB>2</SUB> capture in marine vegetated habitats (<A href=""#B16"">Duarte and Cebrian, 1996</A>). An upper limit to the CO<SUB>2</SUB> capture potential of seaweed aquaculture can be calculated at 2.48 million tons of CO<SUB>2</SUB> (0.68 Tg C) per year. This upper limit assumes that all of the 27.3 million tons fresh weight produced in 2014 be dedicated to <mark>carbon</mark> capture with a 100% yield given by the average <mark>carbon</mark> content of 24.8% of seaweed dry weight (<A href=""#B15"">Duarte, 1992</A>) and a conservative dry weight:fresh weight ratio of 0.1. However, even this upper limit constitutes only about 0.4% of the global wild seaweed CO<SUB>2</SUB> capture estimated at 173 Tg C year<SUP>−1</SUP> (<A href=""#B41"">Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016</A>). At current growth rates, the upper limit to the CO<SUB>2</SUB> capture potential of seaweed aquaculture would exceed 6% of the global CO<SUB>2</SUB> sequestration by wild seaweed by 2,050. Hence, CO<SUB>2</SUB> capture by seaweed aquaculture alone cannot represent a major underpinning of emission reduction programs with the current and even projected potentials. However, these comparisons are based on quantities spread over hugely different areas. The 173 Tg C year<SUP>−1</SUP> sequestered by wild seaweed is spread over the entire ocean, as most of this sequestration occurs in the deep sea, and the <mark>carbon</mark> supporting this flux is produced over the 3.5 million km<SUP>2</SUP> occupied by seaweed (<A href=""#B41"">Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016</A>). In contrast, the area occupied by seaweed aquaculture, calculated from a typical yield of seaweed aquaculture of 1,604 tons DW km<SUP>−2</SUP> (<A href=""#B80"">The Fishery Bureau MoA, 2015</A>), represents only about 1,600 km<SUP>2</SUP> globally, i.e., 0.04% of the area covered by wild seaweed habitats or about 0.004% of the global extent of agricultural land (43 million km<SUP>2</SUP> in 2,000, <A href=""#B66"">Ramankutty et al., 2008</A>). Hence, whereas seaweed aquaculture does not yet have a scale that would support a global role in <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation, it has a strong potential CO<SUB>2</SUB> sequestration intensity of about 1,500 tons CO<SUB>2</SUB> km<SUP>−2</SUP> year<SUP>−1</SUP>, corresponding to the annual CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions of about 300 Chinese citizens.</P><P class=""mb15"">Whereas, seaweed aquaculture currently occupies a minimal fraction, 0.004%, of the coastal ocean, the scope for expansion may be limited by the availability of suitable areas and competing demands for suitable space, and face constraints due to limits to seaweed production imposed by nutrient availability as well as shifting temperature regimes. Current technology for seaweed aquaculture, based on simple structures, can be deployed only in relatively sheltered areas, which will restrict the industry to a fraction of the potential area. Whereas, the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on macroalgal cultivation are not yet clear (<A href=""#B7"">Callaway et al., 2012</A>), ocean warming may reduce fucoid canopies through physiological stress as well as additional associated pressures from warm-water herbivores (<A href=""#B30"">Harley et al., 2012</A>), increased storm energy and reduced nutrient supply (<A href=""#B7"">Callaway et al., 2012</A>), possibly reducing seaweed aquaculture yields. Species cultured at latitudes close to their thermal limits may be impacted by further warming, whereas warming may increase the yield in areas where temperature or ice cover may limit current production, such as predicted for the Arctic (<A href=""#B40"">Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2014</A>). In addition, increased CO<SUB>2</SUB> may increase the yield of seaweed aquaculture (<A href=""#B7"">Callaway et al., 2012</A>). Lastly, the expansion of seaweed aquaculture need also consider potential impacts, such as the introduction of invasive species. However, assessment of the impacts of invasive seaweed species, derived from aquaculture (e.g., <I>Undaria pinnatifida</I>), report both benefits and impacts, which are not severe in nature (<A href=""#B55"">McLaughlan et al., 2014</A>).</P><P class=""mb15"">Despite the limitations acknowledged above, the scope for expansion of seaweed aquaculture with available structures and constraints is substantial. <A href=""#B26"">Gattuso et al. (2006)</A> calculated the potential coastal area marine macrophytes may occupy, on the basis of the assessment of their light requirements and light availability, to be 5.71 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> km<SUP>2</SUP> in the non-polar regions. However, this estimate is based on the light reaching the seafloor, whereas seaweed aquaculture is based on algae suspended near the surface, thereby overcoming issues of light limitation. For instance, Norway has assessed that seaweed aquaculture can markedly stimulate the Norwegian bio-economy (<A href=""#B73"">Skjermo et al., 2014</A>) by expanding seaweed aquaculture along its extensive (90,000 km<SUP>2</SUP>) and productive economic zone from current negligible levels to 20 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> tons by 2,050 (<A href=""#B63"">Olafsen et al., 2012</A>). The surface area occupied by seaweed cultivation has more than tripled the Norwegian coast in only 3 years along (2014 and 2016, <A href=""#B78"">Stévant et al., 2017</A>). Moreover, the scope for expansion of seaweed aquaculture beyond the currently suitable areas may be facilitated in the future by developments in offshore aquaculture, allowing cultivation (e.g., <A href=""#B79"">Sulaiman et al., 2015</A>) and seaweed biorefining (<A href=""#B22"">Fernand et al., in press</A>) in offshore farms (<A href=""#B45"">Lehahn et al., 2016</A>). Current marine spatial models already propose solutions to competing demands for suitable space, such as the co-location of offshore wind farms and seaweed aquaculture (<A href=""#B29"">Gimpel et al., 2015</A>).</P><P class=""mb15"">However, calculations of the CO<SUB>2</SUB> removal potential with seaweed aquaculture also need consider the energy consumption of seaweed farming. Life cycle analyses have concluded that the net removal of CO<SUB>2</SUB> from the atmosphere by biofuel production from seaweed aquaculture is about 961 kg CO<SUB>2</SUB> per ton DW of seaweed (<A href=""#B1"">Alvarado-Morales et al., 2013</A>). The potential CO<SUB>2</SUB> sequestration intensity of seaweed farms of about 1,500 tons CO<SUB>2</SUB> km<SUP>−2</SUP> year<SUP>−1</SUP> is somewhat above 10% of the CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions avoided by offshore wind farms of about 12,500 tons CO<SUB>2</SUB> km<SUP>−2</SUP> year<SUP>−1</SUP>. The CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions avoided per unit area by offshore wind farms were derived by dividing the CO<SUB>2</SUB> avoidance of wind farms by the area occupied by the farms, corrected for a 2% lifecycle CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions over a nominal 20 year life span of the turbines (<A href=""#B52"">Martínez et al., 2009</A>). The calculations were based on data for the Sanbanks offshore wind farms (Germany, 21 turbines in 61 km<SUP>2</SUP>, Vattenfall, 2016)<SUP id=""footnotesuper1""><A class=""footnoteanchor"" href=""#note1"">1</A></SUP> and for the LINCS offshore wind farms (UK, 83 turbines in 35 km<SUP>2</SUP>, <A href=""#B8"">Centrica Energy, 2007</A>).</P><P class=""mb15"">Clearly, the comparison above would suggest that seaweed aquaculture cannot be the option of choice if the sole intent is to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark>. However, establishing a seaweed farm in some areas of the world is rather inexpensive, requiring for instance an initial investment of &lt; US $ 15,000 for a 1 ha seaweed farm in Mexico (<A href=""#B71"">Robledo et al., 2013</A>), whereas the cost of a state-of-the-art offshore wind turbine, including installation, is about US $ 1.5 million per turbine, and involves order-of-magnitude larger maintenance costs. Hence, many developing nations cannot afford addressing <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation through high-cost solutions, such as off-shore wind farms, but can indeed establish seaweed farms, and thereby in addition to <mark>climate</mark> mitigation, they will be producing a valuable biomass with potential for delivering food, feed, biomolecules, and energy <A href=""http://www.fao.org/docrep/field/003/AC287E/AC287E01.htm"">http://www.fao.org/docrep/field/003/AC287E/AC287E01.htm</A> (<A href=""#B60"">Msuya, 2011</A>; <A href=""#B67"">Rebours et al., 2014</A>). Moreover, “<I>blue</I>” biofuels, such as seaweed biofuels, do not compete for resources with agriculture, as they do not require arable land, freshwater or fertilizer, herbicide or pesticide applications and are, therefore in many respects, more environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark> than current biofuels derived from land crops (<A href=""#B17"">Duarte et al., 2009</A>, <A href=""#B18"">2013</A>). Calculations of the area required for seaweed aquaculture to supply 60% of the transportation fuel vary broadly, from &lt; 1% of the economic exclusive zone (EEZ) for Norway, to 10% of the Dutch EEZ and about twice of the German EEZ (<A href=""#B22"">Fernand et al., in press</A>). The option to expand seaweed aquaculture by increasingly occupying offshore areas is not without challenges, including new engineering designs to withstand rough sea states as well as additional costs, and energy use, involved in transporting the crops and operators across greater distances (<A href=""#B22"">Fernand et al., in press</A>). Further, as nutrient concentrations typically decrease offshore, nutrient availability may impose constraints on seaweed aquaculture yield in offshore farms (<A href=""#B22"">Fernand et al., in press</A>).</P><P class=""mb15"">A stepwise approach to maximizing the benefits from seaweed aquaculture would include to sequentially extract high-value molecules used in the food, pharma or biotech industries, such as bioactive sulphated polysaccharides, pigments, and antioxidants (<A href=""#B14"">D'Orazio et al., 2012</A>; <A href=""#B50"">Mak et al., 2014</A>; <A href=""#B31"">Herrero and Ibáñez, 2015</A>), and then convert—after extraction of carbohydrates for the hydrocollid industry or for biofuels production—the lower-value residue to protein concentrates with value in the feed industry (<A href=""#B24"">Francavilla et al., 2015</A>; <A href=""#B3"">Bikker et al., 2016</A>; <A href=""#B72"">Seghetta et al., 2016</A>). Algal biorefineries have evolved from concept and laboratory tests to pilot-scale plants involving a range of seaweed species and environments (e.g., <A href=""#B2"">Baghel et al., 2014</A>; <A href=""#B46"">Lorbeer et al., 2015</A>; <A href=""#B3"">Bikker et al., 2016</A>; <A href=""#B53"">Masarin et al., 2016</A>), and may soon become commercial operations. The range of potential products also include using the nutrient-rich residues from a biofuel production for fertilizer, which may also serve for C retention in soil (<A href=""#B72"">Seghetta et al., 2016</A>). New bioenergy concepts also use seaweed by-products and debris in energy production (<A href=""#B35"">Kaspersen et al., 2016</A>).</P><P class=""mb15"">Seaweed farms also act as a source of DOC and POC exported to adjacent locations, where some of this <mark>carbon</mark> may be buried (<A href=""#B84"">Zhang et al., 2012</A>). We recently summarized 105 reports of sequestration of seaweed to <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration in sediments or the deep sea, and showed that 25% of the <mark>carbon</mark> exported from macroalgal stands, which represents about 43% of their net primary production, is sequestered in continental shelf sediments or in the deep-sea (<A href=""#B41"">Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016</A>). A fraction of the organic <mark>carbon</mark> exported from seaweed farms is also ultimately sequestered in sediments or exported to the deep sea (e.g., <A href=""#B84"">Zhang et al., 2012</A>), further supporting the role of seaweed farms in <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation. However, as seaweed grown in aquaculture is harvested, the fraction of its net primary production available to be sequestered is likely smaller than that of wild seaweed stands. Whereas, most macroalgal stands grow on rocky shores, thereby requiring the export of <mark>carbon</mark> to depositional sites to contribute to <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration (<A href=""#B41"">Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016</A>), seaweed farms can be placed over soft sediments, where detritus could be buried. The processes conducive to sequestration are, otherwise, similar to those operating in wild seaweed stands, including export with ocean currents during storms and/or tidal currents, transport to the deep-sea along submarine canyons, and sinking of exported seaweed material ballasted by epiphytes and/or stones attached to their holdflasts (<A href=""#B41"">Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016</A>).</P><P class=""mb0"">Even where food production, and not <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation, is the main goal of seaweed farming, benefits in terms of <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation can be substantial. The reason for this is that the CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions involved in producing seaweed aquaculture are much less than those involving in producing a comparable amount of agriculture products on land. Agriculture is responsible for about 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, resulting from land-use change in conversion of wild ecosystems into croplands, intense emissions associated with the production and application of industrial fertilizers and emissions from cattle (<A href=""#B70"">Robertson et al., 2000</A>; <A href=""#B75"">Smith, 2002</A>). Seaweed aquaculture generates food while minimizing the impacts associated with land-based food production systems (e.g., <A href=""#B17"">Duarte et al., 2009</A>). For instance, recent <I>in vitro</I> experiments showed that fermentation of seaweed, simulating that of ruminant digestion, substantially reduced methane emissions (<A href=""#B38"">Kinley et al., 2016</A>; <A href=""#B49"">Maia et al., 2016</A>), and that addition of only 2% of specific seaweed species to the diet of cattle could reduce the methane emission from cattle production by 99% (<A href=""#B48"">Machado et al., 2016</A>). Indeed, ruminants were traditionally fed seaweed in many coastal regions during periods of feed scarcity, but the potential benefits in terms of reduced methane emissions have only recently been realized (<A href=""#B38"">Kinley et al., 2016</A>; <A href=""#B49"">Maia et al., 2016</A>). Hence, supplementing feed for ruminant cattle with seaweed holds a potential to reduce methane emissions, a possibility that, if confirmed by <I>in vivo</I> and farm-scale experiments, could greatly contribute to mitigate emissions of this powerful greenhouse gas. Prebiotic compounds and essential minerals in seaweeds may furthermore help to enhance livestock production and health (<A href=""#B68"">Rey-Crespo et al., 2014</A>; <A href=""#B51"">Makkar et al., 2016</A>), as well as substitute the use of antibiotics in the intensive livestock production (<A href=""#B62"">O'Doherty et al., 2010</A>; <A href=""#B64"">O'Shea et al., 2014</A>). An additional potential benefit of seaweed farming for agriculture is a reported increase in productivity of crops via soil amelioration by nutrient-rich seaweed biochar (<A href=""#B69"">Roberts et al., 2015</A>; <A href=""#B83"">Zacharia et al., 2015</A>) or seaweed compost (<A href=""#B11"">Cole et al., 2016</A>), thereby avoiding emissions involved in synthetic fertilizer production (<A href=""#B75"">Smith, 2002</A>). Yet, it is unlikely that seaweed aquaculture will comprise a sizeable fraction of vegetable production on land, particularly as food demand is growing with increasing human population.</P><H2>Benefits of Seaweed Aquaculture for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Adaptation</H2><P class=""mb15"">The IPCC defines <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation as the process of adjustment to actual or expected <mark>climate</mark> and its effects (<A href=""#B34"">IPCC, 2014</A>). In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities whereas in natural systems it refers to human intervention to facilitate its adjustment to expected <mark>climate</mark> and its effects (<A href=""#B34"">IPCC, 2014</A>). In this context, we address the use of seaweed aquaculture for <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation in terms of its capacity to avoid harms to human systems (e.g., coastal protection, ensure food security) and vulnerable ecosystems (e.g., provide refugia from ocean acidification and ocean deoxygenation).</P><P class=""mb0"">By creating coastal habitats, seaweed aquaculture can potentially contribute some of the ecosystem functions that natural kelp forests and macroalgal beds support (<A href=""#B74"">Smale et al., 2013</A>). Some of these functions contribute, as mentioned above, to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark> while another set of functions have <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation benefits (Figure <A href=""#F1"">1</A>, cf. <A href=""#B18"">Duarte et al., 2013</A>). For example, the canopies of farmed seaweeds, like those of wild seaweeds, dampen wave energy and hence, serve as live coastal protection structures buffering against coastal erosion (<A href=""#B59"">Mork, 1996</A>; <A href=""#B47"">Løvås and Tørum, 2001</A>). Norwegian kelp forests dominated by <I>Laminaria hyperborea</I> have been reported to reduce wave heights by up to 60% (<A href=""#B59"">Mork, 1996</A>). A key difference, in terms of the capacity of farmed seaweed to reduce wave energy is that their canopies are suspended from the surface rather than being benthic. The wave-attenuating effect depends on the extent and structure of the seaweed habitat (<A href=""#B28"">Gaylord et al., 2007</A>) as well as the energy involved as seaweed farms will be damaged during high-energy storms.</P><DIV class=""Imageheaders"">FIGURE 1</DIV><DIV class=""FigureDesc""><P><STRONG>Figure 1. Overview of key <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation- and adaptation benefits of seaweed farming</STRONG>. Photo: Yngvar Olsen.</P></DIV><P class=""mb15 w100pc float_left mt15"">Dense seaweeds, farmed as well as wild, also represent productivity hot-spots with associated high pH during day when photosynthesis reduces CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations (e.g., <A href=""#B57"">Middelboe and Hansen, 2007</A>; <A href=""#B42"">Krause-Jensen et al., 2015</A>). They may, hence, serve a role in protecting calcifies from projected ocean acidification (<A href=""#B42"">Krause-Jensen et al., 2015</A>). Kelp forests support high biodiversity, including calcifiers such as lobsters, crabs, molluscs, and crustaceans (<A href=""#B77"">Steneck et al., 2002</A>; <A href=""#B74"">Smale et al., 2013</A>) and high daytime pH probably contributes to this effect. Seaweed farms are similarly reported to support high biodiversity (<A href=""#B65"">Radulovich et al., 2015</A>). As day-periods of high productivity and pH in seaweed habitats can alternate with night-periods where respiration creates reduced pH (<A href=""#B12"">Delille et al., 2009</A>), the potential for pH-upregulation and associated effects of seaweeds as refugia for calcifiers should increase with photoperiod. Indeed, during midsummer near the poles where photoperiods exceed 21 h, seaweed productivity can create sustained high pH over the summer period and be particularly suitable habitats for calcifiers (<A href=""#B43"">Krause-Jensen et al., 2016</A>). The capacity of seaweed aquaculture to affect pH and provide refugia for calcifiers depend also on flow regimes (<A href=""#B33"">Hurd, 2015</A>) and increase where the farms are located in coastal environment with weak currents and/or where the seaweed themselves slow down flow. The capacity of seaweed farms to offer habitat for biodiversity is, however, temporary, as this capacity is lost at harvest.</P><P class=""mb0"">Ocean de-oxygenation with warming is also a component of <mark>climate change</mark> impacts in the ocean of mounting concern (<A href=""#B36"">Keeling et al., 2010</A>), particularly for eutrophic coastal areas, which are particularly prone to experience hypoxia (<A href=""#B13"">Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008</A>). Seaweed aquaculture results in more autotrophic ecosystems than even those supported by wild seaweed, because the production is harvested, and is, therefore, removed from being remineralized, consuming oxygen, in the ecosystem. Hence, seaweed farms provide oxygen-rich habitats, providing refugia from hypoxia and declining oxygen levels, further contributing to allow marine organisms to adapt to this component of a warmer ocean.</P><H2>Spatial Planning to Maximize Seaweed <I>Blue <mark>Carbon</mark></I> Farming</H2><P class=""mb15"">Maximizing the <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation impact of seaweed farming also requires that the farms exert no negative impact on natural coastal <mark>carbon</mark> stocks, particularly those associated with seagrass meadows. Seagrass meadows are hot-spots of <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration and hence, key <I>Blue <mark>Carbon</mark></I> habitats (<A href=""#B19"">Duarte et al., 2005</A>, <A href=""#B18"">2013</A>; <A href=""#B56"">McLeod et al., 2011</A>; <A href=""#B23"">Fourqurean et al., 2012</A>). They are vulnerable to human disturbance leading to shading and mechanical damage (<A href=""#B82"">Waycott et al., 2009</A>), both of which could result from activities at neighboring seaweed farms. On the other hand, nutrient removal by seaweed farms can improve water quality and allow recovery of seagrass in severely eutrophied areas.</P><P class=""mb15"">Of course the placement of seaweed farms must also consider the habitat requirements of the cultured seaweed (<A href=""#B37"">Kerrison et al., 2015</A>) as well as habitat conditions optimizing the quality of the crop for the targeted use (<A href=""#B5"">Bruhn et al., 2016</A>). Additional environmental benefits may arise from choosing areas already enriched in nutrients, including use in polycultures to reduce nutrient impacts of animal aquaculture. While seaweed farming under eutrophic conditions may increase the yield of some crops, it can represent a severe challenge for other crops such as kelp, which risks overgrowth by epiphytes and hence thrive better at less eutrophic sites with sufficient water flow to replenish nutrients, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and oxygen, and limit epiphytic growth (<A href=""#B5"">Bruhn et al., 2016</A>).</P><P class=""mb15"">Locating seaweed farms in areas under particular risk from <mark>climate change</mark> impacts, such as low-lying coastal areas, vulnerable to flooding during storms with increasing sea level, areas prone to exposure to acidified and/or oxygen-depleted waters, may provide a tactical approach to enhance the benefits of seaweed aquaculture for <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation. However, these, and other, environmental conditions also place constraints on the type of seaweed that can be grown as well as the possible products that can be derived from the farm.</P><P class=""mb0"">Spatial planning of seaweed aquaculture to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark> should also seek to minimize life-cycle CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions by co-locating farming and processing, and covering energy requirements by renewable energy where possible. In addition, spatial planning is required to minimize negative interactions with other uses of the coastal zone, such as navigation, as well as to minimize environmental impacts from seaweed aquaculture.</P><H2>Conclusion</H2><P class=""mb0"">The discussion above provides a suite of arguments supporting the consideration of seaweed aquaculture as a tool for <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation and adaptation, while also identifying possible caveats and limitations. Indeed, the growing seaweed aquaculture industry is already delivering these benefits, which have not been properly accounted for nor have been credited to seaweed farmers. Because of the very low investment required to set up seaweed aquaculture farms, seaweed aquaculture is a particularly sound strategy for coastal developing nations to contribute to <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation while protecting their shoreline and marine ecosystems from some of the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, such as ocean acidification and ocean de-oxygenation. Constraints for the expansion of the <mark>climate</mark> mitigation and adaptation benefits associated with seaweed aquaculture are multiple. In the case of China, the main challenges are competition for suitable space with other uses and the maintenance of a sufficient profit margin to continue to engage farmers. More generically, the constraints involve physical constraints, such as the availability of suitable areas; regulatory constraints, such as the requirements for concessions for seaweed aquaculture; marine spatial planning constraints, such as competition for space with other marine-based activities; and market constraints, such as the existence of demand for seaweed aquaculture products, necessary to maintain a profit margin that may motivate prospective farmers to engage. Promoting seaweed aquaculture as a component of <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation and adaptation strategies requires that all four dimensions of the social-ecological system that supports seaweed aquaculture (cf. <A href=""#B4"">Broitman et al., 2017</A>) be addressed: (1) biological productivity to enhance <mark>carbon</mark> capture, (2) environment constraints to the expansion of seaweed aquaculture, (3) policy tools that enable seaweed aquaculture, and (4) manage societal preferences and markets demands for seaweed products. Maintaining a market price that encourages seaweed farmers to engage and implement design improvements to maximize <mark>climate</mark> services delivered by the farm requires that markets diversify to increase the demand for seaweed products. Subsidizing farmers, either directly or indirectly through tax abatement, for farms credited as blue <mark>carbon</mark> seaweed farms may further increase engagement with this strategy. While the contribution of seaweed aquaculture to <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation and adaptation will remain globally modest, it may be substantial in developing coastal nations and will provide add-on value to the societal benefits derived from seaweed aquaculture.</P><H2>Author Contributions</H2><P class=""mb0"">CD and DK conceived and wrote the piece.

By 2025 new ships built will be 30% more energy efficient than those built in 2014. </P><P>The <A href=""/en/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/Pages/04MARPOLamendments.aspx"">mandatory data collection system</A> for fuel oil consumption of ships, which entered into force in March 2018, will provide robust data and information on which future decisions on additional measures, over and above those already adopted, can be made. </P><P>The mandatory data collection system is intended to be the first in a three-step approach in which analysis of the data collected will provide the basis for an objective, transparent and inclusive policy debate in the MEPC, under a roadmap (through to 2023) for developing a “Comprehensive IMO strategy on reduction of GHG emissions from ships”. The roadmap was agreed in 2016.</P><P>Support for implementation of IMO’s energy-efficiency measures is provided, in particular, through two major global projects executed by IMO: </P><P>• The Global Maritime Energy Efficiency Partnerships Project (GloMEEP Project) is aimed at supporting the uptake and implementation of energy efficiency measures for shipping, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping. The GloMEEP project was launched in 2015 in collaboration with the Global Environment Facility and the United Nations Development Programme. A &quot;Global Industry Alliance to Support Low <mark>Carbon</mark> Shipping&quot; (or GIA), launched in 2017 under the auspices of the GloMEEP Project, is identifying and developing solutions that can support overcoming barriers to the uptake of energy efficiency technologies and operational measures in the shipping sector. Website:<A href=""http://glomeep.imo.org/"">http://glomeep.imo.org/</A></P><P>• The global maritime technology network (GMN) project, funded by the European Union, has established a network of five Maritime Technology Cooperation Centres (MTCCs) in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Pacific. Through collaboration and outreach activities at regional level, the MTCCs will focus their efforts during 2018 and beyond to help countries develop national maritime energy-efficiency policies and measures, promote the uptake of low-<mark>carbon</mark> technologies and operations in maritime transport and establish voluntary pilot data-collection and reporting systems.

crop prices across the developing world, leading to a 20-percent rise in child
malnutrition, a new study finds.
<P>
The total calories available in 2050 will be lower than in
2000, the <A href=""http://www.ifpri.org/"">International Food Policy Research
Institute (IFPRI)</A> estimates, increasing malnutrition rates in South Asia
and sub-Saharan Africa in particular.
</P><P>&quot;Farmers will have reduced yields, but it will vary by
region, vary by crop, and vary by management system,&quot; said Gerald Nelson, an
IFPRI senior research fellow and lead author of the report, released today. 
</P><P>
Higher temperatures are expected to reduce crop yields,
allow damaging weeds and insects to spread, and shift precipitation patterns
worldwide. While some agricultural regions are expected to benefit from <mark>climate</mark>
change, overall production will decline for the world's rice, wheat, maize, millet,
and sorghum harvests, the report said. 
</P><P>
The report, released as international <mark>climate</mark> negotiators
discuss a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol, is the first to combine
<mark>climate</mark> and agricultural models to measure the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on the
global food supply. 
</P><P>
Most severely affected will be the wheat-growing regions of
South Asia, Europe and Central Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa,
where production is projected to decline by 46, 47, and 35 percent,
respectively. Also under threat are Middle Eastern rice paddies, where
production is expected to fall by 36 percent. 
</P><P>
The regions that would benefit from <mark>climate change</mark> would
experience relatively smaller changes. The analysis estimates that wheat
production in Latin America will grow by 13 percent and that millet production will
increase in the East Asia and Pacific region and in Latin America and the Caribbean, by 6 and 8 percent, respectively.

The expected changes vary for irrigated and rain-fed fields.
Irrigated rice yields are projected to decline by more than 16 percent in
developing countries, whereas rain-fed rice would decline by less than 1
percent. Likewise, irrigated wheat yields are projected to decline by more than
31 percent in developing countries, and rain-fed wheat would increase by more
than 1 percent. 
</P><P>
Rising concentrations of greenhouse gases may, however,
encourage some plants to waste less water and grow more quickly, a process
known as <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide fertilization. If so, the total calories available in
developing countries may increase by nearly 6 percent by 2050, the study said.
But Nelson cautioned that these gains may be negated by the rise in pest
populations. 
</P><P>&quot;There's an ongoing debate in the scientific community about
the effectiveness of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide fertilization,&quot; Nelson said. &quot;We provide
both sides of the story.&quot;</P><P>
With the human population projected to reach 9 billion by
2050, more people eating meat and dairy products, and biofuels demanding more
farmland, overall food production will need to increase by some 70 percent more
than the 2005-07 output, according to a <A href=""http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/35571/icode/"">United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report</A> released last week. 
</P><P>
The FAO expects that enough land and water resources will be
available in 2050 for chronic malnourishment to be reduced to 5 percent, a
major drop from the 16 percent observed throughout the developing world in 2003-05.
But production increases alone will not ensure that food becomes more
available, said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon at a <A href=""http://www.un.org/apps/news/infocus/sgspeeches/statments_full.asp?statID=602"">food
security event last week.</A></P><P>&quot;Our goal is to initiate a new era for agricultural
development - a revolutionary approach that will support smallholder farmers,
especially women, a transformation of markets, and trading systems so they work
better for the poor,&quot; Ban said. 
</P><P>
Although the FAO estimates do not factor in <mark>climate change</mark>,
a <A href=""http://www.fao.org/wsfs/forum2050/wsfs-forum/en/"">forum of
government experts</A> will meet in Rome
next month to discuss food policy strategies; investments to adapt to <mark>climate</mark>
change will be part of the agenda. 
</P><P>
The IFPRI report recommends that at
least $7 billion be set aside annually to help developing countries adapt to
the agricultural effects of <mark>climate change</mark>. The funds would support
agricultural research, <A href=""/node/6235"">improve
irrigation systems</A>, and expand rural roads. 
</P><P>
The World Bank estimates in its <A href=""http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTWDRS/EXTWDR2010/0,,menuPK:5287748%7EpagePK:64167702%7EpiPK:64167676%7EtheSitePK:5287741,00.html"">2010
<I>World Development Report</I></A> that $75
billion will be needed each year to adapt to the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>,
such as sea-level rise, tropical diseases, and agricultural decline.  
</P>
Adaptation costs are highly uncertain due to the
unpredictability of <mark>climate change</mark>, said Rosina Bierbaum, co-director of the Bank
report. As much as half of the estimated funds 
required for adaptation could be applied for immediate
projects, but the costs for many of these projects are still unknown.
<P>&quot;It's not completely clear what we should be including,&quot;
Bierbaum said. &quot;We're not coping with the <mark>climate</mark> shocks of today, nonetheless
of tomorrow.&quot;</P><P>
Still, given the threats many developing countries are
likely to face due to <mark>climate change</mark>, <A href=""http://www.oxfam.org/"">Oxfam
International</A> <mark>climate</mark> advisor Antonio Hill said that financial resources
should be provided sooner rather than in the distant future. 
</P><P>&quot;Prevention is cheaper than cure,&quot; Hill said. &quot;Unless
developing countries receive enough support in the short term, costs in 2045
will be to compensate for actual damages, not to prevent them.&quot;</P><P>
International leaders gathered on Monday in Bangkok, Thailand,
for the <A href=""http://unfccc.int/meetings/intersessional/bangkok_09/items/4967.php"">fourth
round of international <mark>climate</mark> negotiations</A> this year. The <mark>climate change</mark>
summit this December in Copenhagen,
Denmark, will
address funding adaptation, lowering global emissions, and developing new
<mark>carbon</mark> sequestration strategies.

	A new video from the European Space Agency explains how changes in <mark>climate</mark> are causing <A href=""https://www.space.com/30379-nasa-sea-level-rise-model-video.html"">sea levels to rise</A> around the world.</P><P>
	There are three main causes for this change in global sea level, according to the video: thermal expansion of oceans, the <A href=""https://www.space.com/37206-omg-nasa-mission-greenland-ice.html"">melting of ice sheets</A> and glaciers, and changes in land-water storage. The agency uses satellite data to measure how much each of these individual components attributes to the sea level increase.</P><P>
	Meltwater from glaciers accounts for about a 6.6 millimeter (0.26 inches) sea level rise every decade, the video says, which accounts for 20 percent of the total change between 2003 and 2013. Greenland’s ice sheet accounts for 8.3 millimeters (0.33 inches), or about 25 percent of the total, while the Antarctic ice sheet contributes 3.6 millimeters (0.14 inches) or 11 percent of the decade total. Changes in land-water storage (such as lakes) contribute 3.3 millimeters (0.13 inches) or 10 percent, and ocean thermal expansion adds 9.9 millimeters (0.39 inches) or 30 percent.</P><P>
	Water expands when it <A href=""https://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/files/archive/activities/ts1pcac2.pdf"">freezes into ice</A>, and contracts when it melts; but above a <A href=""https://parade.com/401150/marilynvossavant/does-warm-water-expand/"">certain temperature</A> water begins to expand as it warms, according to the <A href=""http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sealevel.html"">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</A>.So as the ocean accumulates &quot;the excess heat caused by greenhouse gas emissions,&quot; its volume increases and the sea level rises.</P><P>
	Scientists can also measure sea level rise independently, <A href=""https://www.space.com/31650-spacex-rocket-landing-jason3-satellite-launch-webcast.html"">using satellite altimeters</A> to determine where on Earth the water is rising most, according to the video. Comparing these measurements with how much each individual component contributes to the sea level rise helps scientists better understand the sea level budget — the discrepancy between how much the water is actually rising and how much it should be rising according to models that take into account the various causes of sea level change.</P><P><EM>Follow Kasandra Brabaw on Twitter </EM><A href=""https://twitter.com/KassieBrabaw""><EM>@KassieBrabaw</EM></A><EM>.

The world came back from signing the <mark>climate</mark> accord in <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/17/paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-flame-of-hope-diplomacy-christiana-figueres"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Paris</A> last December exactly as Chamberlain returned from Munich: <A href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/12/can-we-hope-after-the-paris-agreement/420174/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hopeful</A>, even exhilarated, that a major threat had finally been tackled.

You may want a revolution, but we don’t need one to save the planet.” All it would take, he insisted, is for America to implement Obama’s plan for clean power, and to continue “guiding the world as a whole toward sharp reductions in emissions,” as it had in Paris.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""article-text-wrap""><DIV class=""article-text-grid""><P>This is, simply put, as wrong as Chamberlain’s “peace in our time.” Even if every nation in the world complies with the Paris Agreement, the world will heat up by as much as 3.5 degrees Celsius by 2100—not the 1.5 to 2 degrees promised in the pact’s preamble. And it may be too late already to meet that stated target: We actually flirted with that <A href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-flirts-with-a-1-5-degree-celsius-global-warming-threshold1/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">1.5 degree</A> line at the height of the El Niño warming in February, a mere 60 days after the world’s governments solemnly pledged their best efforts to slow global warming.

Yes, following the Paris accord would doom much of the Antarctic—but a “far more stringent effort to limit emissions of greenhouse gases would stand a fairly good chance of saving West Antarctica from collapse.” </P><P>What would that “far more stringent effort” require? For years now, <mark>climate</mark> scientists and leading economists have called for treating <mark>climate change</mark> with the same resolve we brought to bear on Germany and Japan in the last world war.

What would it mean to mobilize for World War III on the same scale as we did for the last world war?</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>As it happens, American scientists have been engaged in a quiet but concentrated effort to figure out how quickly existing technology can be deployed to defeat global warming; a modest start, in effect, for a mighty Manhattan Project.

The </SPAN><A href=""http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/USStatesWWS.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">numbers</A><SPAN> are remarkably detailed: In Alabama, for example, residential rooftops offer a total of 59.7 square kilometers that are unshaded by trees and pointed in the right direction for solar panels. Taken together, Jacobson’s work demonstrates conclusively that America could generate 80 to 85 percent of its power from sun, wind, and water by 2030, and 100 percent by 2050. In the past year, the Stanford team has offered similar </SPAN><A href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/139-countries-could-get-all-of-their-power-from-renewable-sources1/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">plans</A><SPAN> for 139 nations around the world.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>The research delves deep into the specifics of converting to clean energy. Would it take too much land? The Stanford numbers show that you would need about four-tenths of one percent of America’s landmass to produce enough renewable energy, mostly from sprawling solar power stations. Do we have enough raw materials? “We looked at that in some detail and we aren’t too worried,” says Jacobson. “For instance, you need neodymium for wind turbines—but there’s seven times more of it than you’d need to power half the world. Electric cars take lithium for batteries—but there’s enough lithium just in the known resources for three billion cars, and at the moment we only have 800 million.”</SPAN></P><P>But would the Stanford plan be enough to slow global warming? Yes, says Jacobson: If we move quickly enough to meet the goal of 80 percent clean power by 2030, then the world’s <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels would fall below the relative safety of 350 parts per million by the end of the century. The planet would stop heating up, or at least the pace of that heating would slow substantially. That’s as close to winning this war as we could plausibly get. We’d endure lots of damage in the meantime, but not the civilization-scale destruction we currently face. (Even if all of the world’s nations meet the pledges they made in the Paris accord, <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is currently on a path to <A href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/<mark>carbon</mark>-dioxide-level-unseen-human-history/story?id=19152850"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hit</A> 500 or 600 parts per million by century’s end—a path if not to hell, then to someplace with a similar setting on the thermostat.)</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote pull-left""><P><B>Defeating the Nazis required more than brave soldiers. It required a wholesale industrial retooling. </B></P></ASIDE><P>To make the Stanford plan work, you would need to build a hell of a lot of factories to turn out thousands of acres of solar panels, and wind turbines the length of football fields, and millions and millions of electric cars and buses. But here again, experts have already begun to crunch the numbers. Tom Solomon, a retired engineer who oversaw the construction of one of the largest factories built in recent years—Intel’s mammoth Rio Rancho semiconductor plant in New Mexico—took Jacobson’s research and calculated how much clean energy America would need to produce by 2050 to completely replace fossil fuels. The answer: 6,448 gigawatts. </P><P><SPAN>“Last year we installed 16 gigawatts of clean power,” Solomon says. “So at that pace, it would take 405 years. Which is kind of too long.”</SPAN></P><P>So Solomon did the math to figure out how many factories it would take to produce 6,448 gigawatts of clean energy in the next 35 years. He started by looking at SolarCity, a clean-energy company that is currently building the nation’s biggest solar panel factory in <A href=""http://www.buffalonews.com/business/solarcity-delaying-buffalo-factory-production-20160210"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Buffalo</A>. “They’re calling it the giga-factory,” Solomon says, “because the panels it builds will produce one gigawatt worth of solar power every year.” Using the SolarCity plant as a rough yardstick, Solomon calculates that America needs 295 solar factories of a similar size to defeat <mark>climate change</mark>—roughly six per state—plus a similar effort for wind turbines.</P><P><SPAN>Building these factories doesn’t require any new technology. In fact, the effort would be much the same as the one that Solomon oversaw at Intel’s semiconductor factory in New Mexico: Pick a site with good roads and a good technical school nearby to supply the workforce; find trained local contractors who can deal with everything from rebar to HVAC; get the local permits; order long-lead-time items like I-beam steel; level the ground and excavate; lay foundations and floors; build walls, columns, and a roof; “facilitate each of the stations for factory machine tooling with plumbing, piping, and electrical wiring”; and train a workforce of 1,500. To match the flow of panels needed to meet the Stanford targets, in the most intense years of construction we need to erect 30 of these solar panel factories a year, plus another 15 for making wind turbines. “It’s at the upper end of what I could possibly imagine,” Solomon says.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Turning out more solar panels and wind turbines may not sound like warfare, but it’s exactly what won World War II: not just massive invasions and pitched tank battles and ferocious aerial bombardments, but the wholesale industrial retooling that was needed to build weapons and supply troops on a previously unprecedented scale. Defeating the Nazis required more than brave soldiers. It required building big factories, and building them really, really fast.</SPAN></P><P>In 1941, the world’s largest industrial plant under a single roof went up in six months near Ypsilanti, Michigan; Charles Lindbergh called it the “Grand Canyon of the mechanized world.” Within months, it was churning out a B-24 Liberator bomber every hour. Bombers! Huge, complicated planes, endlessly more intricate than solar panels or turbine blades—containing 1,225,000 parts, 313,237 rivets. Nearby, in Warren, Michigan, the Army built a tank factory faster than they could build the power plant to run it—so they simply towed a steam locomotive into one end of the building to provide steam heat and electricity. That one factory produced more tanks than the Germans built in the entire course of the war.</P><P><SPAN>It wasn’t just weapons. In another corner of Michigan, a radiator company landed a contract for more than 20 million steel helmets; not far away, a rubber factory retooled to produce millions of helmet </SPAN><I>liners. </I><SPAN>The company that used to supply fabrics for Ford’s seat cushions went into parachute production. Nothing went to waste--when car companies stopped making cars for the duration of the fighting, GM found it had thousands of 1939 model-year ashtrays piled up in inventory. So it shipped them out to Seattle, where Boeing put them in long-range bombers headed for the Pacific. Pontiac made anti-aircraft guns; Oldsmobile churned out cannons; Studebaker built engines for Flying Fortresses; Nash-Kelvinator produced propellers for British de Havillands; Hudson Motors fabricated wings for Helldivers and P-38 fighters; Buick manufactured tank destroyers; Fisher Body built thousands of M4 Sherman tanks; Cadillac turned out more than 10,000 light tanks. And that was just Detroit—the same sort of industrial mobilization took place all across America.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>According to the conventional view of World War II, American business made all this happen simply because it rolled up its sleeves and went to war. As is so often the case, however, the conventional view is mostly wrong. Yes, there are endless newsreels from the era of patriotic businessmen unrolling blueprints and switching on assembly lines—but that’s largely because those businessmen paid for the films. Their PR departments also put out their own radio serials with titles like “Victory Is Their Business,” and “War of Enterprise,” and published endless newspaper ads boasting of their own patriotism. In reality, many of America’s captains of industry didn’t want much to do with the war until they were dragooned into it. Henry Ford, who built and managed that Ypsilanti bomber plant, was an America Firster who urged his countrymen to stay out of the war; the Chamber of Commerce (now a leading opponent of <mark>climate</mark> action) fought to block FDR’s Lend-Lease program to help the imperiled British. “American businessmen oppose American involvement in any foreign war,” the Chamber’s president explained to Congress.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""article-text-wrap""><DIV class=""article-text-grid""><P><SPAN>Luckily, Roosevelt had a firm enough grip on Congress to overcome the Chamber, and he took the lead in gearing up America for the battles to come. Mark Wilson, a historian at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, has just finished a decade-long study of the mobilization effort, entitled </SPAN><I>Destructive Creation</I><SPAN>. It details how the federal government birthed a welter of new agencies with names like the War Production Board and the Defense Plant Corporation; the latter, between 1940 and 1945, spent $9 billion on 2,300 projects in 46 states, building factories it then leased to private industry. By war’s end, the government had a dominant position in everything from aircraft manufacturing to synthetic rubber production.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>“It was public capital that built most of the stuff, not Wall Street,” says Wilson. “And at the top level of logistics and supply-chain management, the military was the boss. They placed the contracts, they moved the stuff around.” The feds acted aggressively—they would cancel contracts as war needs changed, tossing factories full of people abruptly out of work. If firms refused to take direction, FDR ordered many of them seized. Though companies made money, there was little in the way of profiteering—bad memories from World War I, Wilson says, led to “robust profit controls,” which were mostly accepted by America’s industrial tycoons. In many cases, federal authorities purposely set up competition between public operations and private factories: The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard built submarines, but so did Electric Boat of Groton, Connecticut. “They were both quite impressive and productive,” Wilson says.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>“Usually, when people from different worlds are dealing with each other, they get into conflicts and then dig in their heels deeper,” Berk says. “But because the stakes are so high and it’s moving so fast, no one doubts that if you don’t get a handle on this battle in the Atlantic, then the immediate consequences will be really grave. So they’re willing to do this kind of pragmatic trial and error. They start to see that ‘I can’t dig in my heels--I need this other person to learn from.’” In the face of a common enemy, Americans worked together in a way they never had before.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>That attitude quickly reset after the war, of course; solidarity gave way to the biggest boom in personal consumption the world had ever seen, as car-packed suburbs sprawled from every city and women were retired to the kitchen. Business, eager to redeem its isolationist image and shake off New Deal restrictions, sold itself as the hero of the war effort, patriotic industrialists who had overcome mountains of government red tape to get the job done. And the modest “operations researchers,” who had entered and learned from the real world when they managed radar development during the war, retreated to their ivory towers and became much grander “systems analysts” once the conflict ended. Robert McNamara, a former Ford executive, brought an entire wing of the Rand Corporation to the Defense Department during the Kennedy administration, where the think-tank experts promptly privatized most of the government shipyards and plane factories, and used their out-of-touch computer models to screw up government programs like Model Cities, the ambitious attempt at urban rehabilitation during the War on Poverty. “The systems analysts completely took over,” Berk says, “and the program largely failed for that reason.”</SPAN></P><P>Today we live in the privatized, siloed, business-dominated world that took root under McNamara and flourished under Reagan. The actual wars we fight are marked by profiteering, and employ as many private contractors as they do soldiers. Our spirit of social solidarity is, to put it mildly, thin. (The modern-day equivalent of Father Coughlin is now the Republican candidate for president.) So it’s reasonable to ask if we can find the collective will to fight back in this war against global warming, as we once fought fascism. </P><P>For starters, it’s important to remember that a truly global mobilization to defeat <mark>climate change</mark> wouldn’t wreck our economy or throw coal miners out of work. Quite the contrary: Gearing up to stop global warming would provide a host of social and economic benefits, just as World War II did. It would save lives. (A worldwide switch to renewable energy would cut air <mark>pollution</mark> deaths by 4 to 7 million a year, according to the Stanford data.) It would produce an awful lot of jobs. (An estimated net gain of roughly two million in the United States alone.) It would provide safer, better-paying employment to energy workers. (A new study by Michigan Technological University found that we could retrain everyone in the coal fields to work in solar power for as little as $181 million, and the guy installing solar panels on a roof averages about $4,000 more a year than the guy risking his life down in the hole.) It would rescue the world’s struggling economies. (British economist Nicholas Stern<A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/27/nicholas-stern-<mark>climate</mark>-change-davos"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow""> calculates</A> that the economic impacts of unchecked global warming could far exceed those of the world wars or the Great Depression.) And fighting this war would be socially transformative. (Just as World War II sped up the push for racial and gender equality, a <mark>climate</mark> campaign should focus its first efforts on the frontline communities most poisoned by the fossil fuel era. It would help ease income inequality with higher employment, revive our hollowed-out rural states with wind farms, and transform our decaying suburbs with real investments in public transit.) </P><P>There are powerful forces, of course, that stand in the way of a full-scale mobilization. If you add up every last coal mine and filling station in the world, governments and corporations have spent $20 trillion on fossil fuel infrastructure. “No country will walk away from such investments,” <A href=""http://www.vaclavsmil.com/wp-content/uploads/scientificamerican0114-521.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">writes</A> Vaclav Smil, a Canadian energy expert. As investigative journalists have shown over the past year, the oil giant Exxon <A href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-<mark>climate</mark>-change-almost-40-years-ago/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">knew</A> all about global warming for decades—yet spent millions to spread <mark>climate</mark>-denial propaganda. The only way to overcome that concerted opposition—from the very same industrial forces that opposed America’s entry into World War II—is to adopt a wartime mentality, rewriting the old mindset that stands in the way of victory. “The first step is we have to win,” says Jonathan Koomey, an energy researcher at Stanford University. “That is, we have to have broad acceptance among the broader political community that we need urgent action, not just nibbling around the edges, which is what the D.C. crowd still thinks.” </P><ASIDE class=""pullquote pull-right""><P><B>FDR geared up early: The </B><SPAN class=""s1""><B>ships and planes that won </B></SPAN><B>the Battle of Midway were all built before Pearl Harbor.</B></P></ASIDE><P>That political will is starting to build, just as it began to gather in the years before Pearl Harbor. A widespread movement has killed off the <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/us/obama-expected-to-reject-construction-of-keystone-xl-oil-pipeline.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Keystone</A> pipeline, stymied Arctic drilling, and <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/nyregion/cuomo-to-ban-fracking-in-new-york-state-citing-health-risks.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">banned</A> fracking in key states and countries. As one oil industry official lamented in July, “The ‘keep-it-in-the-ground’ campaign” has “controlled the conversation.” This resembles, at least a little, the way FDR actually started gearing up for war 18 months before the “date which will live in infamy.” The ships and planes that won the Battle of Midway six months into 1942 had all been built before the Japanese attacked Hawaii. “By the time of Pearl Harbor,” Wilson says, “the government had pretty much solved the problem of organization. After that, they just said, ‘We’re going to have to make twice as much.’” </P><P>Pearl Harbor <I>did</I> make individual Americans willing to do hard things: pay more in taxes, buy billions upon billions in war bonds, endure the shortages and disruptions that came when the country’s entire economy converted to wartime production. Use of public transit went up 87 percent during the war, as Naomi Klein points out in <I>This Changes Everything</I>;40 percent of the nation’s vegetables were grown in victory gardens. For the first time, women and minorities were able to get good factory jobs; Rosie the Riveter changed our sense of what was possible.</P><P>Without a Pearl Harbor, in fact, there was only so much even FDR could have accomplished. So far, there has been no equivalent in the <mark>climate</mark> war—no single moment that galvanizes the world to realize that nothing short of total war will save civilization. Perhaps the closest we’ve come to FDR’s “date of infamy” speech—and it wasn’t all that close—was when <A href=""http://grist.org/politics/bernie-sanders-says-<mark>climate</mark>-change-is-the-greatest-threat-to-national-security/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Bernie Sanders</A>, in the first debate, was asked to name the biggest security threat facing the planet. “<mark>Climate change</mark>,” he replied—prompting all the usual suspects to tut-tut that he was soft on “radical Islamic terrorism.” Then, in the second debate, the question came up again, a day after the Paris massacres. “Do you still believe that?” the moderator asked, in gotcha mode. “Absolutely,” <A href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/11/bernie-sanders-<mark>climate</mark>-change-isis"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">replied</A> Sanders, who then proceeded to give an accurate account of how record drought will lead to international instability.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""article-text-wrap""><DIV class=""article-text-grid""><P>Had he won, it’s possible that Bernie could have combined his focus on jobs and <mark>climate</mark> and infrastructure into some kind of overarching effort that really mattered—he was, after all, the presidential candidate most comfortable with big government since FDR. Donald Trump, of course, will dodge this war just as he did Vietnam. He thinks (if that’s actually the right verb) that <mark>climate change</mark> is a <A href=""http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/yes-donald-trump-did-call-<mark>climate</mark>-change-chinese-h/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hoax</A> manufactured by the Chinese, who apparently in their Oriental slyness convinced the polar ice caps to go along with their conspiracy. Clinton’s advisers originally promised there would be a “<mark>climate</mark> war room” in her White House, but then corrected the record: It would actually be a “<A href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2016/05/08/hillary-clinton-plans-a-<mark>climate</mark>-map-room-in-the-white-house-podesta/#100b3691912e"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow""><mark>climate</mark> map room</A>,” which sounds somewhat less gung ho. </P><P>In fact, one of the lowest points in my years of fighting <mark>climate change</mark> came in late June, when I sat on the commission appointed to draft the Democratic Party platform. (I was a Sanders appointee, alongside Cornel West and other luminaries.) At 11 p.m. on a Friday night, in a mostly deserted hotel ballroom in St. Louis, I was given an hour to offer nine amendments to the platform to address <mark>climate change</mark>. More bike paths passed by unanimous consent, but all the semi-hard things that might begin to make a real difference—a fracking ban, a <mark>carbon</mark> tax, a prohibition against drilling or mining fossil fuels on public lands, a <mark>climate</mark> litmus test for new developments, an end to World Bank financing of fossil fuel plants—were <A href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/06/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-<mark>climate</mark>-platform"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">defeated by 7–6 tallies</A>, with the Clinton appointees voting as a bloc. They were quite concerned about <mark>climate change</mark>, they insisted, but a “<A href=""http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/hillary-clinton-2016-democratic-platform-213993"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">phased-down</A>” approach would be best. There was the faintest whiff of Munich about it. Like Chamberlain, these were all good and concerned people, just the sort of steady, evenhanded folks you’d like to have leading your nation in normal times. But they misunderstood the nature of the enemy. Like fascism, <mark>climate change</mark> is one of those rare crises that gets stronger if you don’t attack. In every war, there are very real tipping points, past which victory, or even a draw, will become impossible. And when the enemy manages to decimate some of the planet’s oldest and most essential physical features—a polar ice cap, say, or the Pacific’s coral reefs—that’s a pretty good sign that a tipping point is near. In this war that we’re in—the war that physics is fighting hard, and that we aren’t—winning slowly is exactly the same as losing.</P><P>To my surprise, things changed a couple weeks later, when the final deliberations over the Democratic platform were held in Orlando. While Clinton’s negotiators still wouldn’t support a ban on fracking or a <mark>carbon</mark> tax, they did <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/14072016/democratic-party-embrace-<mark>carbon</mark>-price-tax-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">agree</A> we needed to “price” <mark>carbon</mark>, that wind and sun should be given priority over natural gas, and that any federal policy that worsened global warming should be rejected. </P><P>Maybe it was polls showing that Bernie voters—especially young ones—have been slow to sign on to the Clinton campaign. Maybe the <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/20/june-2016-14th-consecutive-month-of-record-breaking-heat-says-us-agencies"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hottest June</A> in American history had opened some minds. But you could, if you squinted, create a hopeful scenario. Clinton, for instance, <A href=""http://cnsnews.com/news/article/penny-starr/clinton-deploy-half-billion-more-solar-panels-end-my-first-term"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">promised</A> that America will install half a billion solar panels in the next four years. That’s not so far off the curve that Tom Solomon calculates we need to hit. And if we do it by building solar factories of our own, rather than importing cheap foreign-made panels, we’ll be positioning America as the world’s dominant power in clean energy, just as our mobilization in World War II ensured our economic might for two generations. If we don’t get there first, others will: Driven by anger over smog-choked cities, the Chinese have already begun installing renewable energy at <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/11/china-overtakes-eu-to-become-global-wind-power-leader"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">a world-beating rate</A>.</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote pull-left""><P><B>In this war we’re in—the war  that physics is fighting hard, and that we aren’t—winning slowly is the same as losing.</B></P></ASIDE><P>“It would be a grave mistake for the United States to wait for another nation to take the lead in combating the global <mark>climate</mark> emergency,” the Democratic <A href=""https://www.demconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Democratic-Party-Platform-7.21.16-no-lines.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">platform</A> asserts. “We are committed to a national mobilization, and to leading a global effort to mobilize nations to address this threat on a scale not seen since World War II.”</P><P>The next president doesn’t have to wait for a <mark>climate</mark> equivalent of Pearl Harbor to galvanize Congress. Much of what we need to do can—and must—be accomplished immediately, through the same use of executive action that FDR relied on to lay the groundwork for a wider mobilization. The president could immediately put a halt to drilling and mining on public lands and waters, which contain at least half of all the untapped <mark>carbon</mark> left in America. She could slow the build-out of the natural gas system simply by correcting the outmoded way the EPA calculates the warming effect of methane, just as Obama <A href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/01/coal-obama-federal-land/424422/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">reined in</A> coal-fired power plants. She could tell her various commissioners to put a stop to the federal practice of rubber-stamping new fossil fuel projects, rejecting those that would “significantly exacerbate” global warming. She could instruct every federal agency to buy all their power from green sources and rely exclusively on plug-in cars, creating new markets overnight. She could set a price on <mark>carbon</mark> for her agencies to follow internally, even without the congressional action that probably won’t be forthcoming. And just as FDR brought in experts from the private sector to plan for the defense build-out, she could get the blueprints for a full-scale <mark>climate</mark> mobilization in place even as she rallies the political will to make them plausible.

Because of the complexity of global warming science as well as the challenge of securing accurate estimations of emissions from these various sectors, this estimation is the best we can hope for. While more research is certainly needed, in the meantime, we must begin to make policy changes to address what we do know: That our food system is a significant contributor to the global warming effect, and that we each can do something about it. </P><H2>On the Farm</H2><H3>Fertilizers and on-farm fossil fuel use</H3><P>Industrial farms   <SUP class=""iframeClick glossary""><A title=""Click to see definition"" href=""/library/view.php?gl=4426"">G</A></SUP>are fossil-fuel addicted places, from their reliance on fossil fuels for powering machinery to petroleum-based chemicals used to create artificial soil fertility, protect against pests, and stave off weeds. The use of fossil fuels on farms, as well as in the manufacture of fertilizers and agricultural chemicals, contributes to the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the food sector. </P><P>With one-third of the world’s cereal harvest and 90 percent of the world’s soy harvest being raised for animal feed, the energy required to grow those crops is a major factor in these on-farm emissions.   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5297"">F</A></SUP>In the United States and Canada, half of all synthetic fertilizer is used for feed crops.   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=3763"">F</A></SUP>In the UK, the total is nearly 70 percent.   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=3763"">F</A></SUP></P><P>A major reason that beef, in particular, has such a large environmental impact is because, of all livestock, cattle are among the worst converters of grain to meat. Whereas in nature, cattle, which are ruminants, convert inedible-to-humans grasses into high-grade proteins, under industrial production, grainfed cattle only provide about one pound of beef for every 10 to 16 pounds of feed they consume.* </P><P>Because industrialized agriculture also relies on huge amounts of water for irrigation, these farms will be much more vulnerable as <mark>climate change</mark> increases extreme droughts. Globally, 70 percent of the world’s available freshwater is being diverted to irrigation-intensive agriculture.   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5310"">F</A></SUP></P><P><SPAN class=""bold"">*Note:</SPAN> &quot;Conversion ratios&quot; are hotly contested. In Frances Moore Lappe’s book, <SPAN class=""italic"">Diet for a Small Planet</SPAN>, she estimated that the conversion ratio for US-feedlot cattle is sixteen pounds of grain and soy to produce one pound of beef. In <SPAN class=""italic"">The End of Food</SPAN>, journalist Paul Roberts argues that these conversion ratios don’t account for the 60 percent of a cow’s weight that is bone, organ, and hide—inedible stuff. The real conversion ratio for beef, Roberts argues, should be even lower. He estimates that it takes &quot;a full 20 pounds of grain to make a single pound of beef.&quot;   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5308"">F</A></SUP>  <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5307"">F</A></SUP> </P><H3>The impact of livestock</H3><P>The other reason that livestock production has such a substantial impact on <mark>climate change</mark> is that livestock are among the main sources of the world’s methane emissions. (Rice cultivation is another, accounting for one-tenth of all agricultural emissions, according to the <SPAN class=""italic"">Stern Report</SPAN>).   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5303"">F</A></SUP> Ruminant livestock, including cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goats, are the main agricultural sources of methane. Ruminants digest through microbial, or &quot;enteric&quot; fermentation, which produces methane that is released by the animals through belching and, to a lesser degree, via flatulence. While this process enables ruminants to digest fibrous grasses that humans can’t convert into digestible form, it also contributes to livestock’s impact on <mark>climate change</mark>. Enteric fermentation accounts for one-quarter of the total emissions from the livestock sector. (Land use changes, such as deforestation and desertification caused by over-pasturing livestock or growing feed crops, account for another 35.4%, while manure accounts for 30.5%).   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5305"">F</A></SUP></P><P>Industrial livestock production also generates greenhouse gasses due to the manner in which <A href=""http://www.<mark>sustainable</mark>table.org/906/waste-management"" target=""_self"" title=""Waste Management"">animal waste</A> is managed. In <mark>sustainable</mark> agricultural systems, there's no such thing as waste: manure is part of a holistic cycle and serves as fertilizer. But in <A href=""http://www.epa.gov/guide/cafo/"" target=""_blank"">concentrated animal feeding operations</A> (CAFOs), animal waste is not cycled through the farm since there’s simply too much of it. Instead, waste is stored in huge pits euphemistically called &quot;manure lagoons.&quot; Without sufficient oxygenation, waste stored in this manner ends up emitting methane and nitrous oxide. The US scores at the top of the world for methane emissions from manure, and pigs are at the top in terms of methane emissions, responsible for half of the globe’s total.   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=3763"">F</A></SUP></P><P>The sheer number of animals being raised for meat on the planet is another reason that livestock production accounts for nearly one-fifth of all global greenhouse gas emissions. In 1965, 10 billion livestock animals were slaughtered each year; today that number is 55 billion.   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5306"">F</A></SUP></P><H2>On the Land</H2><P>The bulk of the pressure on land around the globe, from precious wetlands in Indonesia to rainforests in Brazil, comes from the agricultural sector.   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5303"">F</A></SUP> These rainforests and wetlands play a vital role in <mark>climate</mark> stability because they sequester <mark>carbon</mark>, absorbing and storing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from the atmosphere in the soils and plants. With their destruction, <mark>carbon</mark> is released back into the atmosphere and the <mark>carbon</mark> cycle that keeps our <mark>climate</mark> in balance comes further unhinged. Because these lands play such a vital role as <mark>carbon</mark> sinks, it’s no surprise that their destruction is partly responsible for the emissions from land use changes that add up to nearly 18 percent of the total global warming effect. </P><P>The biggest driver behind these &quot;land use changes,&quot; as the <mark>climate change</mark> folks call them, is the expansion of pasture for cattle, feed crops for livestock, and oil palm for processed foods and biofuels.   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5303"">F</A></SUP> Most of these land use changes are concentrated in just a handful of countries. Brazil is the heart of rainforest destruction, mainly to meet demand for livestock grazing and feed. Malaysia and Indonesia are the world’s main producers of palm oil; here, plantations are leading to rapid rainforest and wetland habitat destruction. Malaysia produced 43 percent and Indonesia 44 percent of the world’s total palm oil last year.   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5304"">F</A></SUP>While the exact amount of land that has been converted into oil palm plantations is hard to determine, we know that demand for palm oil has soared in the last two decades, especially due to growing demand for edible vegetable oils from the world’s top two importing countries, India and China, according to an assessment by the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service.   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5304"">F</A></SUP></P><P>The erosion and deterioration of soils on industrial farms also releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. By destroying the natural soil fertility and disturbing the soil through tillage, industrial farming also adds to the deterioration of soil and its <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5303"">F</A></SUP> </P><H2>On the Road: The Food Miles Question</H2><P>And what about the distance food travels to get to our plates? Despite all the attention to food miles, emissions from food transport are not the biggest component of the sector’s impact on <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>While total emissions from transportation contribute to 13.1 percent of the global warming effect, this includes emissions from toting around all kinds of things—from people to pork chops.   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5300"">F</A></SUP>Transport emissions specifically from food are just a sliver of these emissions. </P><P>Nonetheless, reducing food miles can still make a meaningful dent in our foods' emissions toll. Consider the fossil fuels wasted carting fresh tomatoes to New Jersey, a state with ample farmland that exports tons of tomatoes every year. Researchers at Rutgers University estimated that meeting the New Jersey demand for just one year’s supply of out-of-state tomatoes used up enough fossil fuel to drive an 18-wheeler around the world 249 times. </P><P>Food miles matter because so much of our food transport is unnecessary. Local food is also a better choice because it is fresher and therefore healthier for us. Buying local also supports our local economies. Purchasing local foods means supporting small-scale businesses and protecting green space in our communities. </P><P>Of course, direct trade with small-scale farmers in far away places can be a critical way to support economic development in other parts of the world. But most of the global food trade isn’t benefiting small-scale farmers — it’s benefiting the biggest grain traders at the cost of the <mark>climate</mark>.   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5309"">F</A></SUP>And most of this global food trade is completely unnecessary, or redundant. Consider, for example, the fish caught off the coast of Maine, flash frozen, shipped to China for processing into filets, and shipped back to our mega-markets in the United States. Or, consider the business of beef. In 2007, the US exported 1.431 billion pounds of beef and veal (5.4 percent of our total beef production)   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5302"">F</A></SUP>and imported 3.052 billion pounds of the same, measured by commercial carcass weight.   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5301"">F</A></SUP>This cross-continent transport of food makes economic sense only because the <EM>true</EM> costs of such transport, including the big bill for its contribution to <mark>climate change</mark>, are not counted on the balance sheets of food corporations. </P><P>The main reason for sticking with the locavores is that the local food being celebrated is often a pseudonym for sustainably raised foods—and those foods will be the ones produced without fertilizers, grown without destroying precious wetlands or rainforests, and with animals raised on pasture rather than in confinement. </P><H2>Other Sources of Emissions</H2><P>Because the food system is connected to so many aspects of our lives, it’s hard to get an exact tally of total emissions. Here are some other places where the food system’s emissions crop up. </P><UL><LI><SPAN class=""bold"">Waste:</SPAN> Another four percent of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from waste, including food waste. Where does all our uneaten food end up and the tons of food ready for harvest that never even makes it to our plates? Landfills. And landfills are a key source of methane as food and other refuse decay.</LI><LI><SPAN class=""bold"">Manufacturing:</SPAN> An additional 10 percent of global emissions stems from manufacturing and construction, which includes construction for the food industry.</LI></UL><H2>How Can Farming Help Address the <mark>Climate</mark> Crisis?</H2><P>In nature, plants transform the sun’s energy into food that provides a foundation for life. Humans are fueled by this transformation either directly (we eat the food) or indirectly (we eat the animals that have fed on this energy). It’s a clever cycle: it’s inherently abundant. But the industrialization of agriculture, picking up pace in the past generation, has flipped the natural abundance of farming on its head. Instead of producing energy, industrial agriculture consumes it, through the addiction to fossil fuel-powered machinery and petroleum-based agrochemicals. Industrial farms are often considered highly efficient, but only because these wasted inputs and devastating outputs—including the impact on the <mark>climate</mark>—are not accounted for. (See Table 3 : The Core Differences between <mark>Climate</mark>-Crisis Agriculture and <mark>Climate</mark>-Friendly Farming). </P><P>Unlike industrial farms, small-scale organic   <SUP class=""iframeClick glossary""><A title=""Click to see definition"" href=""/library/view.php?gl=4770"">G</A></SUP> and <mark>sustainable</mark> farms rely on people power, not heavy machinery, and depend on nature, not manmade chemicals for soil fertility and pest management. As a result, small-scale <mark>sustainable</mark> farms have been found to emit between one-half and two-thirds less <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide for every acre of production.   <SUP class=""iframeClick footnote""><A title=""Click to see footnote"" href=""/library/view.php?fn=5300"">F</A></SUP></P><P>New research is documenting that organic farms <A href=""http://newfarm.rodaleinstitute.org/depts/NFfield_trials/1003/<mark>carbon</mark>sequest.shtml"" target=""_blank"">can emit as little as half the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide generated by industrial farms</A>. Organic farms also use much less fossil-fuel energy than their conventional counterparts—in many cases as much as one-third less, and studies are also showing that organic farming can sequester <mark>carbon</mark>, providing a potentially powerful tool to help us address <mark>climate change</mark>. In fact, <A href=""http://newfarm.rodaleinstitute.org/depts/NFfield_trials/1003/<mark>carbon</mark>sequest.shtml"" target=""_blank"">10,000 medium-sized organic farms can store as much <mark>carbon</mark> in the soil as we would save if we took one million cars off the road</A>. </P><P>Yes, the very source of energy—the food consumers eat—has become one of the planet’s most significant contributors to <mark>climate</mark> instability, but it need not be. There is another way. </P><H2>An Overview of Food System Sources of Greenhouse Gases</H2><H3><mark>Carbon</mark> dioxide</H3><P><mark>Carbon</mark> dioxide is emitted by burning fossil fuels to power farm machinery, produce agricultural chemicals, and transport food. In addition, <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is released when forests and wetlands are cleared for crop production, particularly for animal feed, pasture, or oil palm production. Finally, trapped <mark>carbon</mark> in soils is also released through soil erosion and deterioration on industrial farms. </P><H3>Methane*</H3><P>Agricultural methane is released primarily by ruminants such as cattle, and during rice production. It has 23 times the greenhouse effect of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide over 100 years. </P><H3><SPAN class=""bold"">Nitrous oxide*</SPAN></H3><P>Nitrous oxide is released mainly from the use of man-made fertilizer, especially the overuse of nitrogen on crops grown for animal feed. It has 296 times the greenhouse effect of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide over 100 years, or 275 over 20 years. </P><P><SPAN class=""bold"">*</SPAN>A note about methane and nitrous oxide: In the US, the food system accounts for an estimated 17 percent of all fossil fuel use, but accounts for a much larger percentage of the country’s methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Widespread overuse of artificial nitrogen fertilizer, for instance, much of which is wasted in leaching and runoff, contributes to three-quarters of total US nitrous oxide emissions. And globally, agriculture is responsible for nearly two-thirds of methane emissions. While methane and nitrous oxide make up much smaller portions of total greenhouse gas emissions, these gases are still important factors in the <mark>climate</mark> crisis, in part because they each have stronger global warming effects than <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and also because they constitute an increasing portion of total emissions. </P><P><SPAN class=""bold"">Table 3 : The Core Differences Between <mark>Climate</mark>-Crisis Agriculture and <mark>Climate</mark>-Friendly Farming</SPAN></P><TABLE border=""1"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""550""><TBODY><TR><TD width=""50%"" valign=""top""><P><SPAN class=""bold italic""><mark>Climate</mark>-Crisis Agriculture</SPAN></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Some have used this as an argument against adopting strong measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For example, while discussing a major U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report on the risks of <mark>climate change</mark>, then-EPA administrator Christine Whitman argued, “As [the report] went through review, there was less consensus on the science and conclusions on <mark>climate change</mark>” (<A id=""xref-ref-1-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-1"">1</A>). Some corporations whose revenues might be adversely affected by controls on <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions have also alleged major uncertainties in the science (<A id=""xref-ref-2-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-2"">2</A>). Such statements suggest that there might be substantive disagreement in the scientific community about the reality of anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>. This is not the case.</P><P id=""p-3"">The scientific consensus is clearly expressed in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC). Created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environmental Programme, IPCC's purpose is to evaluate the state of <mark>climate</mark> science as a basis for informed policy action, primarily on the basis of peer-reviewed and published scientific literature (<A id=""xref-ref-3-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-3"">3</A>). In its most recent assessment, IPCC states unequivocally that the consensus of scientific opinion is that Earth's <mark>climate</mark> is being affected by human activities: “Human activities … are modifying the concentration of atmospheric constituents … that absorb or scatter radiant energy. … [M]ost of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations” [p. 21 in (<A id=""xref-ref-4-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-4"">4</A>)].</P><P id=""p-4"">IPCC is not alone in its conclusions. In recent years, all major scientific bodies in the United States whose members' expertise bears directly on the matter have issued similar statements. For example, the National Academy of Sciences report, <EM><mark>Climate Change</mark> Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions</EM>, begins: “Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise” [p. <A href=""/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.306.5694.1"">1</A> in (<A id=""xref-ref-5-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-5"">5</A>)]. The report explicitly asks whether the IPCC assessment is a fair summary of professional scientific thinking, and answers yes: “The IPCC's conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific community on this issue” [p. 3 in (<A id=""xref-ref-5-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-5"">5</A>)].</P><P id=""p-5"">Others agree. The American Meteorological Society (<A id=""xref-ref-6-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-6"">6</A>), the American Geophysical Union (<A id=""xref-ref-7-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-7"">7</A>), and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) all have issued statements in recent years concluding that the evidence for human modification of <mark>climate</mark> is compelling (<A id=""xref-ref-8-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-8"">8</A>).</P><P id=""p-6"">The drafting of such reports and statements involves many opportunities for comment, criticism, and revision, and it is not likely that they would diverge greatly from the opinions of the societies' members. Nevertheless, they might downplay legitimate dissenting opinions. That hypothesis was tested by analyzing 928 abstracts, published in refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003, and listed in the ISI database with the keywords “<mark>climate change</mark>” (<A id=""xref-ref-9-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-9"">9</A>).</P><P id=""p-7"">The 928 papers were divided into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, paleo<mark>climate</mark> analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. Of all the papers, 75% fell into the first three categories, either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleo<mark>climate</mark>, taking no position on current anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>. Remarkably, none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position.</P><P id=""p-8"">Admittedly, authors evaluating impacts, developing methods, or studying paleoclimatic change might believe that current <mark>climate change</mark> is natural. However, none of these papers argued that point.</P><P id=""p-9"">This analysis shows that scientists publishing in the peer-reviewed literature agree with IPCC, the National Academy of Sciences, and the public statements of their professional societies. Politicians, economists, journalists, and others may have the impression of confusion, disagreement, or discord among <mark>climate</mark> scientists, but that impression is incorrect.</P><P id=""p-10"">The scientific consensus might, of course, be wrong. If the history of science teaches anything, it is humility, and no one can be faulted for failing to act on what is not known. But our grandchildren will surely blame us if they find that we understood the reality of anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> and failed to do anything about it.</P><P id=""p-11"">Many details about <mark>climate</mark> interactions are not well understood, and there are ample grounds for continued research to provide a better basis for understanding <mark>climate</mark> dynamics.

 Although aviation is a relatively small industry, it has a disproportionately large impact on the <mark>climate</mark> system. It accounts for four to nine per cent of the total <mark>climate change</mark> impact of human activity.<P>But at a time when we urgently need to reduce our impact, greenhouse gas emissions from aviation continue to grow. For example, since 1990, <SPAN class=""caps""><mark>CO2</mark> </SPAN>emissions from international aviation have increased 83 per cent. The aviation industry is expanding rapidly in part due to regulatory and taxing policies that do not reflect the true environmental costs of flying. “Cheap” fares may turn out to be costly in terms of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><DIV id=""more""><P><B>How do greenhouse gas emissions from flying compare with emissions from other forms of transport, like driving?</B></P><P>Compared to other modes of transport, such as driving or taking the train, travelling by air has a greater <mark>climate</mark> impact per passenger kilometre, even over longer distances (see graph below). It’s also the mode of freight transport that produces the most emissions.</P><P style=""text-align: center""><A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/aviation/126.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><SPAN class=""caps""><mark>CO2</mark> </SPAN>intensity of passenger transport</A> via <SPAN class=""caps"">IPCC</SPAN></P><P><B>What sorts of greenhouse gases do aircraft produce?</B></P><P>When jet fuel is burned, the <mark>carbon</mark> in the fuel is released and bonds with oxygen (O2) in the air to form <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>). Burning jet fuel also releases water vapour, nitrous oxides, sulphate, and soot.</P><P>A special characteristic of aircraft emissions is that most of them are produced at cruising altitudes high in the atmosphere. Scientific studies have shown that these high-altitude emissions have a more harmful <mark>climate</mark> impact because they trigger a series of chemical reactions and atmospheric effects that have a net warming effect. The <SPAN class=""caps"">IPCC, </SPAN>for example, has estimated that the <mark>climate</mark> impact of aircraft is two to four times greater than the effect of their <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions alone.</P><P><B>What are “contrails” and what is their impact on <mark>climate change</mark>?</B></P><P>Contrails are the long plumes of exhaust that can be seen in the sky behind airplanes. They consist primarily of water droplets and ice, and are formed when water vapour released from burning jet fuel condenses at higher altitudes. Contrails may stay in the sky for many hours, and can spread two kilometres wide before dispersing. The net effect of these contrails is to trap heat that would otherwise escape from the Earth, which contributes to global warming. Studies have shown that night flights have the strongest warming impact, because during the daytime contrails actually reflect some sunlight away from the earth.</P><P><B>What’s being done about emissions from air transportation?</B></P><P>Not much, unfortunately. Countries with national emissions targets under the Kyoto Protocol are only required to account for emissions from domestic flights. Emissions from international flights are not counted. And very little has been done to actually limit these emissions. To date the only formal plan to control and reduce international aviation emissions is being developed within the European Union (EU).</P><P><B>Is it likely that new technologies or fuels will make air transportation more efficient in the near future and help reduce its <mark>climate</mark> impact?</B></P><P>Currently, airplanes use kerosene fuel, and there is no indication that commercial aircraft powered by solar panels, batteries, biofuels, or hydrogen can be expected anytime soon. In terms of efficiency, it appears that improvements in current aircraft technology have nearly reached their limit, and further significant fuel-efficiency gains will only come from the development of radically new airplane designs and systems. The time, cost and coordinated effort it would take to develop and test such designs and then phase them into the world’s fleets of aircraft make this unlikely to happen anytime soon. It is therefore an impractical solution for the urgent problem of <mark>climate change</mark>. In reality, the small, incremental gains that we can reasonably expect in aircraft fuel efficiency will be eclipsed by the projected growth in the industry.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN><ASIDE class=""donate-bar bg-primary"" scroll-section=""""><DIV class=""container""><DIV class=""grid grid--flex""><DIV class=""grid__item w-12-12 w-md-6-12 align-center""><DIV class=""donate-bar__content container--sm m-auto-x""><DIV animate-transform-left=""""><H2 class=""h3 color-white"">You can help</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Canada’s National Reports to the United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (2017)</H1><DIV><DIV class=""mwsbodytext text parbase section""><H2>Introduction and executive summary</H2><P>Canada is pleased to present its 7th National Communication and 3rd Biennial Report on <mark>Climate Change</mark> to meet its reporting requirements under the United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (UNFCCC). Canada has prepared these reports in accordance with adopted guidelines and other guidance for National Communications and Biennial Reports.</P><P>The following Introduction and Executive Summary provides an overview of Canada’s 7th National Communication and 3rd Biennial Report to the UNFCCC. The complete report can be found on the <A href=""http://unfccc.int/files/national_reports/national_communications_and_biennial_reports/application/pdf/82051493_canada-nc7-br3-1-5108_eccc_can7thncomm3rdbi-report_en_04_web.pdf"">UNFCCC website</A>.</P><H3>National action</H3><P>Canada has taken significant steps to address <mark>climate change</mark> since its last report to the UNFCCC. In addition to being one of the first Parties to the UNFCCC to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement, Canada has followed through on its Paris commitments by developing a new national plan to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, enhance resilience to the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>, and transition to a clean growth economy.</P><P>Less than 90 days after Paris <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference in December 2015, the Prime Minister of Canada met with all Provincial and Territorial Premiers (collectively referred to as First Ministers) to adopt the Vancouver Declaration on Clean Growth and <mark>Climate Change</mark>. In the Vancouver Declaration, First Ministers agreed to work together to take ambitious action in support of meeting or exceeding Canada’s commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.</P><P>The Declaration also set the path toward the adoption of the <A href=""/en/services/environment/weather/<mark>climate</mark>change/pan-canadian-framework.html"">Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and <mark>Climate Change</mark></A> on December 9, 2016.<A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn1""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>1</A>  A historic achievement, the Pan-Canadian Framework is Canada’s first <mark>climate change</mark> plan to include commitments by federal, provincial and territorial governments, and is the country’s overarching framework to reduce emissions across all sectors of the economy, stimulate clean economic growth and build resilience to the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The Pan-Canadian Framework is designed to achieve the behavioural and structural changes needed to transition to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy, and was developed collaboratively  by Canada’s  federal, provincial and territorial governments, with input from Indigenous Peoples as well as from businesses, non-governmental organizations, and Canadians across the country.</P></DIV><DIV class=""mwspanel section""><DIV class=""panel well well-sm""><DIV class=""panel-body""><DIV class=""mwsbodytext text parbase section""><P><STRONG>Working with Indigenous Peoples in Canada</STRONG></P><P>Indigenous Peoples are resilient <mark>climate</mark> leaders in Canada, despite being among the most vulnerable to <mark>climate change</mark>. The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring First Nations, Inuit, and the Métis Nation are real partners in Canada’s transition to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy. To help do so, the Government of Canada is working in partnership with the Assembly of First Nations, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, and the Métis National Council through three senior-level tables. These innovative tables enable ongoing partnership with First Nations, Inuit and the Métis Nation in the implementation of the Pan-Canadian Framework and on broader clean growth and <mark>climate change</mark> priorities. Supported by Government of Canada Budget 2017 funding, all three tables met for the first time in fall 2017, are planning to meet again in early 2018, and are identifying areas to work together.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""mwsbodytext text parbase section""><P>The Pan-Canadian Framework builds on the early leadership of provinces and territories and the diverse array of policies and measures already in place across Canada to reduce GHG emissions in all sectors of the economy. The Pan-Canadian Framework includes over fifty concrete measures under four key pillars: <mark>carbon</mark>-<mark>pollution</mark> pricing; complementary actions to reduce emissions; adaptation and <mark>climate</mark> resilience; and clean technology, <mark>innovation</mark> and jobs.</P><P>The plan also includes governance and reporting mechanisms to ensure ongoing collaboration across federal, provincial and territorial governments, to track progress in implementing measures under the Pan-Canadian Framework, and to identify opportunities for further action.</P><P>Pricing <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> is central to Canada’s plan. The Government of Canada has outlined a <A href=""/en/environment-<mark>climate</mark>-change/news/2016/10/canadian-approach-pricing-<mark>carbon</mark>-<mark>pollution</mark>.html"">benchmark for pricing <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark></A> that will build on existing provincial systems and require a minimum price of $10 per tonne is in place across Canada in 2018, rising to $50 per tonne by 2022. The Pan-Canadian Framework also includes complimentary mitigation measures to achieve emissions reductions in the electricity, transportation, built environment, industry, and forestry, agriculture and waste sectors, both in the near-term and as part of a longer-term strategy.</P><P>The Pan-Canadian Framework recognizes the importance of building <mark>climate</mark>-resilience, and sets out measures to help Canadians understand, plan for, and take action to adapt to the unavoidable impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>. As Indigenous Peoples and coastal and northern regions are particularly vulnerable to <mark>climate</mark> impacts, targeted action is being taken to help these communities thrive.</P><P>Recognizing the growing global demand for clean technologies, the Pan-Canadian Framework creates the conditions to encourage and enhance the development and adoption of clean technologies.  The Framework includes new actions to support early-stage technological <mark>innovation</mark>, accelerated commercialization and growth, enhanced adoption of clean technology, and improved metrics to measure success.</P><P>To support these measures, the Government of Canada has announced significant investments to support national actions to reduce emissions, build resilience and support clean technology and <mark>innovation</mark>.</P><H3>International action</H3><P>At the international level, Canada is taking strong action to demonstrate its commitment to advancing the international clean growth economy. Under the UNFCCC, Canada is working closely with the international community to implement the Paris Agreement, and at the 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP23) in November 2017 played a leadership role to advance negotiations on the Paris Agreement guidelines.</P><P>Leading up to and during COP23, Canada also worked to advance several key initiatives. In September 2017, Canada, in collaboration with China and the European Union, hosted an international ministerial meeting with representatives from 34 countries, including major economies, to support global <mark>climate</mark> action and the Paris Agreement, providing an opportunity for ministers to advance discussions in support of the Paris Agreement and its goals. Canada will co-host a second meeting in 2018.</P><P>Canada has also taken on a leadership role to enhance the engagement of Indigenous People on international <mark>climate</mark> action. In September 2017, in the lead-up to COP23, the Government of Canada, in full partnership with Indigenous Peoples of Canada, hosted an Informal Dialogue attended by over 60 governments and Indigenous Peoples from around the world, which advanced discussions on the local communities and Indigenous Peoples platform under the UNFCCC. At COP23 in November 2017, Canada was recognized for its leadership in reaching an agreement to launch the operation of the platform. Also in the lead-up to COP23, Canada hosted an international workshop to exchange views on options for the Gender Action Plan under the UNFCCC, and played a leadership role in achieving agreement on the plan at COP23.</P><P>Canada is working to support the countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> and to support clean growth internationally. Canada is delivering its historic <mark>climate</mark> finance pledge of $2.65 billion to help developing countries transition to low-<mark>carbon</mark>, <mark>climate</mark> resilient economies through diverse bilateral and multilateral initiatives.</P><P>Canada is also an active participant in a variety of multilateral fora that work to reduce GHG emissions and enhance resilience. Canada was one of the first countries to ratify the Montreal Protocol, and has been a strong supporter of efforts to phase down hydrofluoro<mark>carbon</mark>s (HFCs) under the Kigali Amendment to the Protocol. Following release of draft regulations to phase down HFCs, Canada ratified the Kigali Amendment in November 2017, helping to bring the amendment into force on January 1, 2019.</P><P>Canada is playing a leadership role in Mission <mark>Innovation</mark> – a global initiative of countries working to scale up investment in clean energy <mark>innovation</mark> – and is a member of the initiative’s Steering Committee. At COP23, Canada also announced the formation of a North American <mark>Climate</mark> Leadership Dialogue with Mexico and the United States <mark>Climate</mark> Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of 15 United States governors committed to reducing GHGs consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.</P><P>Canada continues to work with international partners, including through the recent announcement with the United Kingdom of the Powering Past Coal Alliance, a global initiative to phase out traditional coal-fired electricity, as well as ongoing work with Mexico to address methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. In addition, in December 2017 Canada and five provinces joined with Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica and two U.S. states to establish the Declaration on <mark>Carbon</mark> Markets in the Americas, which aims to enhance collaboration on <mark>carbon</mark> pricing systems and promote <mark>carbon</mark> markets throughout the American continents.</P><H2>National circumstances</H2><P>Canada’s unique geographic, demographic, and economic circumstances influence its GHG emissions profile.  For example, while Canada has a relatively small population, it also has one of the largest landmasses in the world, most of it located in the northern half of the northern hemisphere. These factors contribute to heavier energy and transportation use than in smaller and/or more densely populated countries.</P><P>Canada’s population remains the smallest among G7 countries but is rapidly growing, mostly through international migration. Currently at 36.7 million inhabitants, it is anticipated that Canada’s population could reach between 40.1 and 47.7 million by 2038. Two-thirds of Canada’s population and urban centers are located within 100 kilometers of the Canada-U.S. border, leaving large parts of the country sparsely populated. The large distance between metropolitan areas and low population density generates high emissions from the transportation sector making it the second largest contributor of GHG emissions in Canada.  </P><P>Canada experiences a wide range of <mark>climate</mark> conditions, with most of the inhabited regions seeing distinct seasons – in particular very warm summers and cold winters. Heating and cooling needs have a great impact on energy use and GHG emissions. Canada’s <mark>climate</mark> has been increasingly warming over the last several years. Northern regions are the most affected, and extreme events such as drought, forests fires, floods and severe thunderstorms are happening more frequently.</P><P>Although <mark>climate</mark> and geography contribute to making Canada a heavy energy user, energy efficiency has improved in recent years. In addition, 80 percent of Canada’s total electricity is produced from non-GHG emitting sources, with hydroelectricity comprising most of this production. The share of renewable power from other sources than hydro has been increasing steadily since 1990 while the supply generated from coal has decreased substantially over the same time period.</P><P>According to the International Monetary Fund, Canada’s growth was the fastest among G7 economies in 2016, with an anticipated real GDP growth rate of 3.5 percent in 2017 and 3.6 percent in 2018. While Canada’s economy is primarily driven by the service sector, its manufacturing, construction, mining, oil and gas, and forestry sectors still represent about 30 percent of the economy which is unique among industrialized countries. These emissions intensive sectors contribute significantly to Canada’s emissions.</P><H2>Canada’s greenhouse gas inventory</H2><P>Canada’s National Inventory Report is prepared and submitted annually to the UNFCCC and includes estimates of CO<SUB>2</SUB> equivalent (CO<SUB>2 </SUB>eq) in the following six sector categories, as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>: Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use, Agriculture, Waste, and Land Use, Land-use Change and Forestry (LULUCF).<A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn2""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>2</A>  Canada also reports estimates of historical emissions and removals according to the following economic sector categories: electricity, transportation, oil and gas, heavy industry, buildings, agriculture, and waste and others.</P><P>In 2015, Canada emitted 722 megatonnes (Mt) of CO<SUB>2</SUB> eq. The energy sector (consisting of Stationary Combustion Sources, Transport, and Fugitive Sources) continues to account for the majority of Canada’s emissions, at 81% or 587 Mt. Other emissions are generated from the Agriculture sector (8%), the Industrial Processes and Product Use sector(7%), and the Waste sector (3%). Alberta continues to have the highest emissions among Canadian provinces, primarily due to expanding oil and gas operations.</P></DIV><DIV class=""mwsbodytext text parbase section""><P><STRONG>Figure 1: Canada's emissions breakdown by IPCC sector (2015)</STRONG></P></DIV><DIV class=""mwsaccordion-html section""><DETAILS><SUMMARY>Long description</SUMMARY><DIV class=""table parbase section""><TABLE class=""table table-bordered""><CAPTION>Canada's emissions breakdown by GHG (2015)</CAPTION><THEAD><TR><TH class=""col-md-6"">IPCC Sector</TH></TR></THEAD></TABLE></DIV></DETAILS></DIV></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

because that is the unit at which water-use data generally are available. In
1990, approximately one-third of the worlds population lived in countries
using more than 20% of their water resources, and by 2025 about 60% of a larger
total would be living in such stressed countries, in the absence of <mark>climate</mark>
change (WMO, 1997), largely because population growth. Arnell (1999b, 2000)
estimates the effect of a number of <mark>climate change</mark> scenarios on national water
resource availability and compares this with estimated future demands for water
(increasing following the CDS outlined in <A href=""index.php?idp=176"">Section 4.4</A>).
<A href=""index.php?idp=180#tab46"">Table 4-6</A> shows the numbers of people living in
countries using more than 20% of their water resources in 2025 and 2050 and
in which the amount of resources decreases by more than 10% as a result of <mark>climate</mark> 
change. There is considerable variability between scenarios, essentially reflecting
how resources change in populous countries, but by the 2020s the table indicates
that about 0.5 billion people could see increased water resources stress as
a result of <mark>climate change</mark>. Significant geographic variations are hidden in
<A href=""index.php?idp=180#tab46"">Table 4-6</A>. Under most of the scenarios considered,
<mark>climate change</mark> increases stresses in many countries in southern and western
Africa and the Middle East, whereas it ameliorates stresses in parts of Asia.

Therefore, there is a need to understand the effect of higher temperature, various precipitation levels and different soil moisture and fertility, by growing them under such <mark>climate</mark>s and determine how variation in temperature, moisture and edaphic factors might affect the plants’ phenology, nutrient, antioxidant and secondary metabolites levels.</P><P id=""__p6"">Antioxidative action is one of the prime physiological functions that protect living organisms from oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reactive oxygen species is a term used to describe a number of reactive molecules and free radicals derived from molecular oxygen. During daily activities and with advanced age, oxidative substances and free radicals accumulate in cells affecting various organs and systems in our body. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are free radicals that are common outcome of normal aerobic cellular metabolic processes [<A href=""#CR1"" rid=""CR1"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_584527159"">1</A>, <A href=""#CR2"" rid=""CR2"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_584527156"">2</A>]. Unbarred generation of these free radicals leads to attack on various biomolecules, cellular machinery, cell membrane, lipids, proteins, enzymes and DNA causing oxidative stress and ultimately cell death [<A href=""#CR3"" rid=""CR3"" class="" bibr popnode"">3</A>]. Overproduction of free radicals can lead to many chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, post-ischemic perfusion injury, cardiovascular diseases, myocardial infarction, chronic inflammation, stroke and septic shock, aging and other degenerative diseases in humans [<A href=""#CR4"" rid=""CR4"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_584527153"">4</A>, <A href=""#CR5"" rid=""CR5"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_584527162"">5</A>]. Human body has an intrinsic system of various enzymes and nutrients to protect from these free radicals. Some extrinsic nutrients are required by many people who are subjected to higher production of free radicals due to stress or physical activities. Micronutrients like vitamin E, β carotene, and vitamin C are the major antioxidants which could be provided in the daily diet as our body cannot produce these nutrients [<A href=""#CR6"" rid=""CR6"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_584527168"">6</A>]. Protection against free radicals can also be enhanced by taking sufficient amounts of exogenous antioxidants [<A href=""#CR7"" rid=""CR7"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_588064811"">7</A>].</P><P id=""__p7"">Antioxidants are used to counterbalance the effect of free radicals. An antioxidant is a stable molecule which donates an electron to a charged free radical and terminates the chain reaction before vital molecules are damaged. Free radical scavenging property of antioxidants delays or inhibits cellular damage [<A href=""#CR8"" rid=""CR8"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_584527152"">8</A>]. Antioxidants are in great demand as they help in reducing ageing signs. Previously many plants have been screened for their antioxidant potential. Thus, there is growing interest in replacing synthetic antioxidants because of the concern over the possible carcinogenic effects of these in foods with natural ingredients [<A href=""#CR9"" rid=""CR9"" class="" bibr popnode"">9</A>]. Primary sources of naturally occurring antioxidants for humans are fruits, vegetables and spices. Medicinal plants contain a wide variety of free radical scavenging molecules such as phenolic compounds (phenolic acids, flavonoids, catechins, proanthocyanidins, quinones, coumarins, tannins etc.), nitrogen compounds (alkaloids, amines, betalains etc.), vitamins, terpenoids, carotenoids and other secondary metabolites which are reported to have antioxidant activity [<A href=""#CR10"" rid=""CR10"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_584527160"">10</A>–<A href=""#CR13"" rid=""CR13"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_584527154"">13</A>]. Efforts have been made to search for novel natural antioxidants from tea, fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices.

Potent antioxidative compounds like Aloe barbendol, Aloe emodin, barbaloin A and Aloe chrysone have been isolated from methanolic extracts of <EM>A. vera</EM>. [<A href=""#CR45"" rid=""CR45"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_584527166"">45</A>]. Biological activities of <EM>A. vera</EM> may be due to the synergistic action of these compounds, rather than from a single defined component [<A href=""#CR46"" rid=""CR46"" class="" bibr popnode"">46</A>].</P><P id=""__p46"">Five different methods were employed for determining antioxidant potential of <EM>Aloe vera</EM> leaf extracts. DPPH radical scavenging method is an extensive procedure to evaluate the free radical scavenging ability of various samples [<A href=""#CR47"" rid=""CR47"" class="" bibr popnode"">47</A>]. The effect of antioxidants on DPPH radical scavenging was supposed to be due to their hydrogen- donating ability. Hydrogen peroxide is generally not very reactive, but it can sometimes be toxic to cell because it can give rise to hydroxyl radicals in the cells. Thus, the removal of H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> is essential for antioxidant defence in cell or food systems. In general, the reducing properties are associated with the presence of reductones, which have been shown to exert antioxidant action through breaking the free radical chain by donating a hydrogen atom [<A href=""#CR48"" rid=""CR48"" class="" bibr popnode"">48</A>, <A href=""#CR49"" rid=""CR49"" class="" bibr popnode"">49</A>]. In the reducing power assay, the presence of reductants in the sample would result in the reduction of Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> to Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> by donating an electron [<A href=""#CR50"" rid=""CR50"" class="" bibr popnode"">50</A>]. Metal chelating activity is based on chelation of Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> ions in a quantitative manner by the reagent ferrozine, which results to the formation of a complex with Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> ions [<A href=""#CR51"" rid=""CR51"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_588064812"">51</A>]. So the chelating ability influences other scavenging activities of free radicals which protect the organisms against oxidative damage. Mechanism of β carotene bleaching is a free radical mediated phenomenon resulting from the formation of hydroperoxides from linoleic acid oxidation. The presence of antioxidant extracts can hinder the extent of β carotene bleaching by acting on the linoleate- free radical and other formations of free radicals in the system [<A href=""#CR52"" rid=""CR52"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_584527164"">52</A>, <A href=""#CR53"" rid=""CR53"" class="" bibr popnode"">53</A>].</P><P id=""__p47"">India is characterized by strong temperature and rainfall variations along with other different environmental and climatic fluctuations in different seasons [<A href=""#CR54"" rid=""CR54"" class="" bibr popnode"">54</A>]. Phytochemical composition of plants is greatly influenced by different agro-climatic conditions. According to previous findings it was suggested that environmental temperature plays a significant role on antioxidant activity evaluation and it is more pronounced in cold weather [<A href=""#CR55"" rid=""CR55"" class="" bibr popnode"">55</A>]. Therefore, we collected the plant material in the winter season (Jan–Feb 2013). In the present study we also found that the extracts of highland and semi-arid zones possess maximum antioxidant potential. Accessions from Tropical zones showed least antioxidant activity in all assays. <EM>A. vera</EM> can grow in almost all types of environmental conditions but there are several factors that can affect the quality and quantity of a particular constituent. Previous studies state that phytochemical composition of plants is influenced by a variety of environmental factors including the geography, <mark>climate</mark>, soil type, sun exposure, grazing stress, seasonal changes etc. [<A href=""#CR56"" rid=""CR56"" class="" bibr popnode"">56</A>–<A href=""#CR58"" rid=""CR58"" class="" bibr popnode"">58</A>].</P><P id=""__p48""><EM>Aloe vera</EM> is a cold sensitive plant.

Lower temperature leads to higher production of phenolics and vice versa [<A href=""#CR62"" rid=""CR62"" class="" bibr popnode"">62</A>]. Plants from hilly areas are thought to be more important from nutritional and dietary points of view [<A href=""#CR63"" rid=""CR63"" class="" bibr popnode"">63</A>]. <EM>A. vera</EM> is found to grow in hot humid and high rainfall conditions, so semi- arid conditions having low rainfall are also not favorable for the plant. Although, soil texture and climatic conditions of semi-arid region is normally most suitable for majority of plant crops, <EM>Aloe</EM> genus however is an exception. In present study, accessions from colder regions showed the good antioxidant activity, supporting the statement that more phytochemicals are produced in plants under stress [<A href=""#CR64"" rid=""CR64"" class="" bibr popnode"">64</A>]. Consequently, phytochemical content can vary with growing environmental conditions. From the present work, it could be concluded that agro- climatic locations along with temperature and rainfall have significant effects on the <EM>A. vera</EM> plant phytoconstituents and its antioxidant potential. However, there is still a need to investigate the effects of soil properties and other related biotic and abiotic factors.</P></DIV><DIV id=""Sec26"" class=""tsec sec""><H2 class=""head no_bottom_margin"" id=""Sec26title"">Conclusion</H2><P id=""__p50"" class=""p p-first-last"">The present study showed that <EM>A. vera</EM> is a promising source of bioactive phenol which has a good antioxidant activity.

Phytochemical analysis in relation to their activity from different climatic regions can help in selecting places for mass production of this plant species to enhance its pharmaceutical and marketing values. The present work tries to establish a correlation between phytochemicals, TPC and antioxidant activity of <EM>A. vera</EM> from different agro-climatic zones of India and have found that climatic zones showed significant effect on all these parameters.

The entire Houston metropolitan region is flooding: Interstates are under feet of water, local authorities have asked boat owners to join rescue efforts, and most of the streams and rivers near the city are in flood stage.</P><P>Some models suggest that the storm will linger over the area until Wednesday night, dumping 50 inches of water in total on Houston and the surrounding area.</P><P>“Local rainfall amounts of 50 inches would exceed any previous Texas rainfall record. The breadth and intensity of this rainfall are beyond anything experienced before,” said a statement from the National Weather Service. “Catastrophic flooding is now underway and expected to continue for several days.” (In years of weather reporting, I have never seen a statement this blunt and ominous.)</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-2""><P>This means that thousands of people—and perhaps tens of thousands of people—are facing a terrifying and all-too-real struggle to survive right now. In an age when the <mark>climate</mark> is changing rapidly, a natural question to ask is: What role did human-caused global warming play in strengthening this storm?</P><P><mark>Climate</mark> scientists, who specialize in thinking about the Earth system as a whole, are often reticent to link any one weather event to global <mark>climate change</mark>. But they say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey—and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide—suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse.</P><P>It may not be obvious why global warming has anything to do with hurricane strength. <mark>Climate change</mark> is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases prevent some of the sun’s rays from bouncing back into space, trapping heat in the planetary system and raising air temperatures all over the world.</P><FIGURE><BLOCKQUOTE class=""twitter-tweet"" data-lang=""en""><P dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">As the world warms, evaporation speeds up.

But that phenomenon alone does not explain <mark>climate change</mark>’s effects on Harvey.</P><P>Storms like Harvey are helped by one of the consequences of <mark>climate change</mark>: As the air warms, some of that heat is absorbed by the ocean, which in turn raises the temperature of the sea’s upper layers.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-3""><P>Harvey benefited from unusually toasty waters in the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm roared toward Houston last week, sea-surface waters near Texas rose to <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>signals.org/node/7158"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'538158'"">between 2.7 and 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit above average</A>. These waters were some of <A href=""https://twitter.com/RyanMaue/status/900388963185295360"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'538158'"">the hottest spots of ocean surface in the world</A>. The tropical storm, feeding off this unusual warmth, was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours.</P><P>“This is the main fuel for the storm,” says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research. “Although these storms occur naturally, the storm is apt to be more intense, maybe a bit bigger, longer-lasting, and with much heavier rainfalls [because of that ocean heat].”</P><P>This also suggests an explanation for one of Harvey’s strangest and scariest behaviors. The storm intensified up until the moment of landfall, achieving category-four strength hours before it slammed into the Texas coast. This is not only rare for tropical cyclones in the western Gulf of Mexico: It may be unique. In the past 30 years of records, <A href=""https://twitter.com/sezick/status/901181680102322176"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'538158'"">no storms west of Florida have intensified in the last 12 hours before landfall</A>.</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote instapaper_ignore"">Harvey is just the kind of weird weather that scientists expect to see more of as the planet warms.</ASIDE><P>Why do storms normally weaken—and why didn’t Harvey? As mentioned above, hurricanes feed and grow on warm ocean surface waters. But as they grow, their strong winds often pick up seawater, churning the oceans and moving the warmest waters deep below the surface. The same winds also bring newer, colder water closer to the atmosphere, which usually serves to drain energy and weaken the storm.</P><P>That didn’t happen with Harvey. The hurricane churned up water 100 or even 200 meters below the surface, said Trenberth, but this water was <EM>still</EM> warm—meaning that the storm could keep growing and strengthening. “Harvey was not in a good position to intensify the way it did, because it was so close to land. It’s amazing it was able to do that,” he told me.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-4""><P>All of this said, a storm like Harvey could have happened even if there was no <mark>climate change</mark>. Planning experts have long fretted over the possibility of a major hurricane striking Houston. Harvey is also a powerful hurricane forming in one of the most hurricane-friendly regions of the world at the peak of hurricane season. Storms similar to it would form in any <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>But Trenberth says that the extra heat could make the storm more costly and more powerful, overpowering and eventually breaking local drainage systems.</P><P>“The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm,” he said. “It may have been a strong storm, and it may have caused a lot of problems anyway—but [human-caused <mark>climate change</mark>] amplifies the damage considerably.”</P><P>More generally, it’s still unclear what effect <mark>climate change</mark> is having on hurricane formation across the greater Atlantic Ocean. A draft version of a major U.S. government review of <mark>climate</mark> science due out later this year says there is “medium confidence” that human activities “have contributed to the observed upward trend in North Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s.”</P><P>Houston has been ground zero for super-damaging storms lately. It has seen four 100-year flooding events since the spring of 2015, <A href=""http://grist.org/article/a-texas-size-flood-threatens-the-gulf-coast-and-were-so-not-ready/"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'538158'"">according to the meteorologist Eric Holthaus</A>. The city also sees 167 percent more heavy downpours than it did in the 1950s. Meanwhile, only one-sixth of its residents have federal flood insurance, though that program has <A href=""http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Flood-insurance-program-deep-in-debt-costs-will-11009266.php"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'538158'"">struggled to adjust to the increased flooding risk</A> associated with <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Yet even compared to recent storms, Harvey is unprecedented—just the kind of weird weather that scientists expect to see more of as the planet warms. Harvey has already dumped more water on Harris County than Tropical Storm Allison, the area’s previous worst-ever flooding disaster in 2001, though it has only lasted half the time of that earlier storm.</P><P>And it will keep raining. As of Sunday afternoon, Buffalo Bayou, a major river near downtown Houston, is one foot above flood stage. It is projected to rise as much as another 12 feet today alone.</P><SECTION><H3>Related Video</H3></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

<P>This explainer post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <STRONG><A href=""/<mark>co2</mark>-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><mark>CO2</mark> and Other GHG Emissions</A></STRONG>.</P></DIV><P>United Nations (UN) member states signed the latest <mark>climate</mark> agreement, <A href=""http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Paris Agreement</A>, in 2015; the agreement set an international target to limit average global warming to <A href=""/<mark>co2</mark>-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions/#introduction"">two degrees celsius</A> above pre-industrial temperatures. An important question then arises: how do we achieve this, and how much will it cost to keep warming below the two degree target?</P><P>So, how do we estimate the economic cost of mitigating <mark>climate change</mark>? The most common way of measuring—and visualizing—the options and costs of reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is to use the so-called 'abatement cost curve' (sometimes referred to as the 'marginal abatement curve'). Here we will explore what these curves are and how we use them. But before proceeding, it's important to note that these curves can be used at a range of levels to assess the best and most economic options we have for reducing GHG emissions. In particular, they can be constructed at global, regional, national or city levels. As such, a range of different abatement cost curves exist. In this post, we will be looking at a global curve developed by McKinsey &amp; Company.<A id=""ref-1"" class=""ref"" href=""#note-1""><SUP>1</SUP></A> Although we could have looked at a number of different examples, this analysis in particular is one of the most widely-referenced and accepted to date.</P><P>Here is a preview of what these abatement costs tell us: If we aggressively pursue all of the low-cost abatement opportunities currently available, the total global economic cost would be €200-350 billion per year by 2030. This is less than one percent of the forecasted global GDP in 2030.</P><H3 id=""what-is-an-abatement-cost-curve"">What is an 'abatement cost curve'?</H3><P>An abatement cost curve measures two key variables, as shown on McKinsey's chart below: abatement potential and the cost of abatement.</P><P>'Abatement potential' is the term we use to describe the magnitude of potential GHG reductions which could be technologically and economically feasible to achieve. We measure this in tonnes (or thousand/million/billion tonnes) of greenhouse gases (which is abbreviated as <A href=""https://ecometrica.com/assets/GHGs-<mark>CO2</mark>-<mark>CO2</mark>e-and-<mark>Carbon</mark>-What-Do-These-Mean-v2.1.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><mark>carbon</mark> dioxide equivalents, or CO<SUB>2</SUB>e</A>). Note that our measure of CO<SUB>2</SUB>e includes all greenhouse gases, not just CO<SUB>2</SUB>.<A id=""ref-2"" class=""ref"" href=""#note-2""><SUP>2</SUP></A> So, on the x-axis we have the abatement potential of our range of options for reducing our GHG emissions; here, each bar represents a specific technology or practice.<A id=""ref-3"" class=""ref"" href=""#note-3""><SUP>3</SUP></A> The thicker the bar, the greater its potential for reducing emissions.</P><P>On the y-axis we have the abatement cost. This measures the cost of reducing our GHG emissions by one tonne by the year 2030, and in this case is given in € (i.e. € per tonne of CO<SUB>2</SUB>e saved).<A id=""ref-4"" class=""ref"" href=""#note-4""><SUP>4</SUP></A> But it's important to clarify here what we mean by the term 'cost'. 'Cost' refers to the economic impact (which can be a loss or gain) of investing in a new technology rather than continuing with 'business-as-usual' technologies or policies. To do this, we first have to assume a 'baseline' of what we expect'business-as-usual' policies and investments would be. This is done—for both costs and abatement potential—based on a combination of empirical evidence, energy models, and expert opinion.<A id=""ref-5"" class=""ref"" href=""#note-5""><SUP>5</SUP></A> This can, of course, be challenging to do; the need to make long-term predictions/projections in this case is an important disadvantage to cost-abatement curves. Whilst not perfect, it does provide useful estimates of relative costs and abatement potential.</P><P>Let's use an example to explain these costs. The majority of the world's private vehicles are currently diesel or gasoline-powered. Our baseline or 'business-as-usual' scenario in this case would be that everyone continues driving vehicles run on fossil fuels, and that growth in the car market continues in line with market projections through to 2030. One option we might consider to reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> is to begin replacing these with electric-powered vehicles. Electric vehicles (at least currently) are typically more expensive than similar gasoline-powered vehicles, so buying an electric vehicle would require a notably higher investment than 'business-as-usual'. However, with time, the running or operating costs of an electric vehicle may be lower than a traditional car (as a result of efficiency gains and lower cost of electricity relative to liquid fuel), so we will begin to get some economic return on our initial investment. This scenario—in which we need an up-front investment in new technology—typically means that the capital intensity of the opportunity is high; but spread across years of operation, the annual average cost falls.</P><P>Our potential mitigation options are ordered from left-to-right in terms of cost (getting progressively more expensive as we move to the right). The higher the bar, the greater the cost. McKinsey's analysis defines an upper cost threshold of €60 per tonne avoided (i.e. the chart only shows alternatives that are 'cheaper' than €60 per tonne). This is the level they consider to be most economically attractive to investors. This figure is somewhat arbitrary, and as we will see later, the report has also estimated potential emissions savings from technologies above €60 per tonne separately.</P><H6>Global greenhouse gas abatement cost curve<A id=""ref-6"" class=""ref"" href=""#note-6""><SUP>6</SUP></A></H6><P>You will see that many options to the left-hand side of the curve have negative costs. Negative costs indicate options which would actually <EM>save</EM> money. These are typically related to energy efficiency or land management projects which would provide an economic return over the longer-term.</P><P>For example, replacing conventional lighting (continuing with this form of lighting would be defined as our 'business-as-usual' case) with energy efficient lighting, would more than pay back in economic terms from lower energy bills. Its 'cost' is therefore negative because we would actually save money. Globally, if we took advantage of all of our negative cost options, we see that we could cumulatively avoid emissions of 11-12 billion tonnes of CO<SUB>2</SUB>e.</P><P>At the other end of the scale we have the more expensive options for mitigation; these are typically related to the delivery of a low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy supply.</P><P>Abatement cost curves are used at a range of scales to aid investment decisions on GHG mitigation options. When making these decisions, both the abatement potential (width) and cost (height) of each option is important. For example, if we look at the lowest end of the scale we see that installing energy efficient lighting is the cheapest option (providing a high economic return through efficiency savings). However, its total abatement potential is very limited. If we were looking for an investment which could save a large quantity of GHGs, we might have to select an option which is more expensive, but has a greater abatement potential. The trade-off between cost and potential is an important one.</P><H3 id=""how-low-could-our-emissions-go"">How low could our emissions go?</H3><P>If we were to implement all of our options for reducing GHG emissions, how much CO<SUB>2</SUB>e would we save?</P><P>On the abatement cost curve above we see that cumulatively, the options costing up to €60 per tonne have a total abatement potential of 38 billion tonnes of CO<SUB>2</SUB>e per year (this is the total width along the horizontal axis). This total potential has been summarized in the chart below. On the y-axis we have our global GHG emissions in billion tonnes of CO<SUB>2</SUB>e, and on the x-axis we see this evolution with time through to 2030.</P><P>The top line we see in this chart is our 'business-as-usual' (BAU) pathway. This is our projection of how global emissions will increase if we don't invest in technology and practices necessary to reduce emissions; this pathway is calculated based on expected <A href=""/world-population-growth/"">population</A> and <A href=""/economic-growth"">economic growth</A> projections. By 2030, with business-as-usual, we would expect our annual emissions to be 70 billion tonnes CO<SUB>2</SUB>e.</P><P>Below this line, we see our options for reducing emissions. Our &lt;€60 per tonne abatement opportunities have been decomposed into energy efficiency, low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy supply and terrestrial <mark>carbon</mark> (forestry and agriculture) options. Combined, these give us our 38 billion tonnes of emissions avoided.</P><P>But we also have two additional opportunities where we could make GHG savings. The first lies in more expensive technical measures, costing  €60-100 per tonne avoided. Such opportunities are not unattainable, however, we might expect the range of cheaper options to have a significantly greater uptake before more expensive technologies are adopted. The second additional opportunity lies in social and behavioral changes which influence energy consumption and consumer choices towards lower-<mark>carbon</mark> options.</P><P>If we include these additional opportunities, our maximum technical abatement potential by 2030 totals 47 billion tonnes of CO<SUB>2</SUB>e per year. Our maximum global potential is therefore a 65-70% reduction relative to our current projected pathway.</P><H6>Global greenhouse gas abatement potential<A id=""ref-7"" class=""ref"" href=""#note-7""><SUP>7</SUP></A></H6><H3 id=""the-total-cost-of-global-<mark>co2</mark>-mitigation"">The total cost of global CO<SUB>2</SUB> mitigation</H3><P>How much would it cost in total to implement all of these options?</P><P>We can calculate this value using our abatement cost curve. The area of each of our bars represents the total cost for each technology or strategy. By adding all of these individual costs, we get the total economic cost. To get the approximated annual cost, we can divide this total by the number of years until our target date (in this case, the year 2030). This method is not strictly accurate, since it assumes that costs will be distributed equally across this timeframe; however, it gives us some relative approximation.</P><P>If we utilized all of our &lt;€60 per tonne abatement opportunities to their full potential (which is an important assumption), McKinsey estimates the total global cost to be €200-350 billion per year by 2030. This is less than one percent of the forecasted global GDP in 2030.</P><P>This cost is however, made more complex by the timing of investment. This timing component is important for financing and capital investment. Our average annual cost is calculated as a balance of how much money we need to invest, and how much we get in return based on efficiency gains and reduced running costs relative to our current technologies. However, as we noted earlier, we often need an initial capital invesment to implement the technology; this initial capital can be high, but begins to pay back over time (resulting in a reduction in the average annual cost through time). The upfront capital investment needed is €530 billion per year by 2020 and €810 billion by 2030. Although these figures may seem substantial, many estimates project that the economic costs of <EM>not</EM> taking action to avert <mark>climate change</mark> would greatly exceed investments in mitigation opportunities.<A id=""ref-8"" class=""ref"" href=""#note-8""><SUP>8</SUP></A></P><P><EM>Technical notes:</EM></P><P>It should be noted that the figures presented in cost abatement curves carry significant uncertainty and interdependencies. The total abatement cost curve is developed based on the construction and combination of individual bars related to a particular technology or practice. The width and height (i.e. abatement potential and cost) is measured independently of other technologies and variables on the curve. However, this assumption is a large and important one: many technologies (for example, solar PV and battery storage) have strong interdependencies. The evolution of one will inevitably have some impact on the other.</P><P>Technology costing is also strongly dependent on scaling effects–unit costs often decrease as capacity increases. The individual costs represented on these charts are therefore calculated with the assumption that the development and scale-up of the respective technology is approached aggressively and full technical potential is achieved. Changes in technology prices through time are assumed based on technology-specific 'learning curves'. Learning curves measure the reduction in cost for every doubling in a technology's capacity. For example, the learning rate for solar PV has been 22% –this means that the cost per unit of power falls by 22% for every doubling of capacity.<A id=""ref-9"" class=""ref"" href=""#note-9""><SUP>9</SUP></A> This analysis assumes that the learning rate for specific technologies remains consistent with past trends.</P><P>McKinsey&amp;Company stress that their estimates therefore carry a high level of uncertainty. They are useful in providing an overview outlook on the total abatement potential (and whether this would be sufficient to meet global <mark>climate</mark> targets) and estimate the potential costs of doing so. Their most useful function is perhaps in allowing for relative comparisons of costs and potential between different technologies; these factors are key for decision-makers looking to investment in low-<mark>carbon</mark> opportunities. Although imperfect, they give a relative sense of magnitude of what could potentially be achieved and if the costs can be managed to do so.</P></SECTION></DIV><FOOTER class=""article-footer""><H2 id=""footnotes"">Footnotes</H2><OL class=""footnotes""><LI id=""note-1""><P>McKinsey&amp;Company (2013).

The French company even published its own <mark>climate</mark> strategy, explaining how it intends to contribute to the goal of keeping global warming below 2°C. But as 350.org France and Observatoire des multinationales reveal in this new report, Total’s actions and strategy are completely at odds with effective action to tackle the <mark>climate</mark> crisis.</P></DIV><DIV class=""crayon article-texte-1008 texte surlignable""><P>Total is facing pressure from some of its investors who are demanding that the company clarify its strategy for dealing with the <mark>climate</mark> issue. During the 2016 annual general meeting, the chairman at Total published a document presenting the key features of this <mark>climate</mark> strategy. Entitled “<A href=""http://www.total.com/sites/default/files/atoms/files/integrating_<mark>climate</mark>_into_our_strategy_eng.pdf"" class=""spip_out"" rel=""external"">Integrating <mark>Climate</mark> Into our Strategy</A>”, this is meant to show how Total intends to respect and implement the international objective, established by the Paris Agreement, to keep current global warming temperatures below 2ºC. At the same time, the company’s chairman announced several acquisitions (Saft, Lampiris) which were advertised as a commitment to the energy transition.</P><P>This report consists of an analysis of the <mark>climate</mark> strategy announced by Total, for the purposes of assessing the reality and ambitions of the measures implemented by the group’s management, in the wake of his announcements.</P><P>It especially shows that Total’s <mark>climate</mark> strategy:
 does not effectively or seriously address the <mark>climate</mark> crisis and its implications;
 does not constitute a significant redirection of the strategy which the company has been pursuing for many years,
 and is characterised by a large number of omissions or misrepresentations of the issues, which shed doubt on the sincerity of the exercise.</P><P>Specifically:</P><P> Total’s <mark>climate</mark> strategy legitimises the large continued investments to develop new gas and oil deposits in the years to come, whereas fossil fuels are by far the main causes of the <mark>climate</mark> crisis. This approach is only compatible with the 2ºC target if we rely heavily on costly and controversial technology whose effectiveness has yet to be proven, especially <mark>carbon</mark> capture and sequestration (CCS). These technologies, however, remain coupled with an intensive use of nuclear power. Without these hazardous solutions, the conclusion should be the complete opposite: freeze the development of new gas and oil deposits, and start planning the anticipated end of the existing deposits.</P><P> The few precise commitments announced by Total executives on the subject of energy transition appear to be very modest, in both terms of ambition and finance. The amount of money dedicated to R&amp;D is marginal in comparison to the billions of euros invested in the exploitation of gas and oil. In addition, these commitments almost exclusively target gas, agrofuels or even <mark>carbon</mark> capture and sequestration, in contrast to renewable energy and energy efficiency which should be at the forefront of a real transition. There appears to be deliberate confusion in this strategy on the part of the company’s management.</P><P> Like the majority of other energy and oil giants, Total executives insist that gas plays a key role in the energy transition, without specifying that this would largely be unconventional gas and that its real benefits for the <mark>climate</mark>, in comparison to coal, are very debatable. The management at Total is sidestepping this debate by presenting, in a particularly cavalier way, the results of a study on this issue which they had commissioned.</P><P> Alongside all this, Total continues to invest in sensitive areas (the Arctic)  or in very risky and polluting practices (oil sands, shale gas, extreme offshore drilling).</P><P>Overall, the <mark>climate</mark> strategy published by Total’s management appears to be an exercise in communication aimed at reassuring their employees, investors and other external stakeholders as well as the public authorities, in which they put forward measures of little consequence.</P><P>The public position adopted by Total’s chairman on the <mark>climate</mark> issue certainly distinguishes them positively from their North American counterparts (but not necessarily their European counterparts), but the actual content of the <mark>climate</mark> strategy does not shield the company from accusations of duplicity, which they have previously faced. We especially do not see how this concretely modifies the company’s strategy.  The document written by Total’s chairman rather suggests that he is attempting to circumvent the debate at little cost, to continue in the same direction all the while appeasing most of the criticism.</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The pledge supports policies in keeping the global temperature below an increase of 2 degrees Celsius. Some response was cautiously optimistic, while other critics debated the feasibility of its goals. The ten signatories include BG Group, BP, Eni, Pemex, Reliance Industries Ltd., Repsol SA, Saudi Aramco, <A href=""/terms/s/shellcorporation.asp"">Shell</A>, Statoil and Total.</P><P>The joint statement came six weeks before the summit, which is hosting delegates from 209 countries. The conference's focus is on reducing the production of greenhouse gases caused by the burning of fossil fuels. (For more, see: <A href=""/articles/investing/092915/5-countries-produce-most-<mark>carbon</mark>-dioxide-<mark>co2</mark>.asp"" target=""_blank""><U>The 5 Countries that Produce the Most <mark>Carbon</mark> Dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>)</U></A>.</P><H2><mark>Climate</mark> Agreement</H2><P>The pledge suggests a number of ways the ten companies will cut the production of greenhouse gases. These measures include reducing the flaring of methane gas, a practice that is a major producer of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere. According to a report by the <A href=""http://rhg.com/reports/untapped-potential"" target=""_blank"">Rhodium Group</A>, oil and gas companies released 3.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas into the air in 2012.  A large percentage of this natural gas was from methane leakage. This represents approximately $30 billion of potential revenue lost, annually, for oil and gas companies. The pledge supports development of “cleaner” energy alternatives including establishing <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage systems. <mark>Carbon</mark> capture is the process of taking <mark>carbon</mark> that is about to be released into the air and storing it in some fashion, usually underground. It is fair to say that, to date, many <mark>carbon</mark> capture attempts have not materialized. <mark>Carbon</mark> capture presents an expensive solution. Patrick Pouyanné, chief executive of <A href=""https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TOT"" target=""_blank"">Total</A> said, “We are looking to have co-operation, for example, in research and development. [<mark>Carbon</mark> capture and storage] is one topic where we need to engage seriously ... it’s one area where we could join forces, but there are other topics that we are discussing between us, so you will see more concrete proposals.” According to the <A href=""/terms/i/international-energy-agency.asp"">International Energy Agency (IEA)</A>, the first large-scale <mark>carbon</mark> capture system was <A href=""http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/news/2015/november/iea-hails-launch-of-new-canadian-<mark>co2</mark>-storage-project-first-to-cut-emissions-fro.html"" target=""_blank""><U>launched</U></A> just this year in Alberta, Canada to curb emissions from oil sands.</P><H2>Divestment</H2><P>Over the past year and a half, energy companies have been targeted by a global campaign to divest their shares in coal companies. Some leading activist investors include Stanford University’s board of trustees, as well as the heirs to the $860 million <A href=""/university/john-d-rockefeller-biography/"">Rockefeller</A> Standard Oil fund. Those that have come together to <A href=""/terms/p/protest-divestment.asp"">divest</A> in oil companies, both individuals and institutions, amount to $50 bn USD of investment. (For more, see: <U><A href=""/articles/investing/072815/divestment-destroying-coal-industry.asp"" target=""_blank"">Is Divestment Killing the Coal Industry?</A>)</U>.</P><P>Some environmental groups are criticizing these oil companies for trying to improve their image specificially for the UN conference. These environmental groups argue that major oil companies spend substantial effort in lobbying against improved <mark>climate policy</mark> through their trade associations, while publicly vocalizing support for the goal of reducing emissions.</P><H2>Influence on <mark>Climate Policy</mark></H2><P><A href=""http://influencemap.org/site/data/000/099/InfluenceMap_Oil_Sector_October_2015.pdf"">InfluenceMap</A> has released a new report with over 10,000 pieces of evidence that show how corporations are influencing <mark>climate policy</mark>. The report suggeststhat oil companies often use trade associations to bolster support against <mark>climate change</mark>. Their report indicates, for example, that Shell rates the highest among those analyzed on how actively it responds to <mark>climate change</mark> in public, while at the same time opposing these objectives through trade associations. InfluenceMap states Shell shows the highest &quot;misalignment&quot; factor of the companies researched. Shell has vocalized support of <mark>climate change</mark> with Barack Obama in the <A href=""http://www2.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan/clean-power-plan-existing-power-plants"" target=""_blank"">Clean Power Act</A> in 2014. The report shows that Shell has executives on powerful trade bodies that in turn, tried to dismantle these exact efforts. BP has also openly criticized <mark>climate change</mark> initiatives in the past. One BP executive said that in the EU there were “too many targets for <A href=""/terms/r/renewable_resource.asp"">renewables</A>​, for efficiency and for GHGs.” A Total executive is on the board of the American Chemistry Council, which has stated,  “Aggressive reduction targets that the <A href=""/terms/e/environmental-protection-agency.asp"">EPA</A> has proposed will cause <A href=""http://influencemap.org/site/data/000/099/InfluenceMap_Oil_Sector_October_2015.pdf"" target=""_blank"">significant and irreparable harm..</A>” Meanwhile, BP and Total express a supportive and progressive message towards <mark>climate change</mark> policy in the media and on their websites.</P><H2>The Bottom Line</H2><P>Large oil companies have signed a joint agreement in <mark>climate policy</mark> change for purposes of the current United Nations <mark>climate</mark> summit, although many details in the agreement are unsubstantiated. The issue remains complicated, with many oil companies trying to exert influence through both public announcements and powerful trade groups. Meanwhile at the conference, developed countries sustain <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/04/are-rich-countries-selling-the-developing-world-short-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change"" target=""_blank"">ongoing criticism</A> for their lack of effective commitment to substantive change. The <A href=""http://www.cop21paris.org/images/downloads/SIF15_framework_agenda_01.12.pdf"" target=""_blank"">COP 21 agenda</A> includes speakers from many multinational corporations, and the impact of policy statements from Big Oil has yet to be fully ascertained.</P><P> </P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The scale of historical emissions associated with these fossil fuel producers is large enough to have contributed significantly to <mark>climate change</mark>, according to the report.</P><P> ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron are identified as among the highest emitting investor-owned companies since 1988. If fossil fuels continue to be extracted at the same rate over the next 28 years as they were between 1988 and 2017, says the report, global average temperatures would be on course to rise by 4C by the end of the century. This is likely to have <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/31/planet-will-warm-4c-2100-<mark>climate</mark>"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">catastrophic consequences</A> including substantial species extinction and global food scarcity risks.</P><P>While companies have a huge role to play in driving <mark>climate change</mark>, says Faria, the barrier is the “absolute tension” between short-term profitability and the urgent need to reduce emissions.</P><P>A <A href=""http://www.<mark>carbon</mark>tracker.org/report/stranded-assets-danger-zone/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""><mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker study</A> in 2015 found that fossil fuel companies risked wasting <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/25/fossil-fuel-companies-risk-wasting-2tn-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">more than $2tn</A> over the coming decade by pursuing coal, oil and gas projects that could be worthless in the face of international action on <mark>climate change</mark> and advances in renewables – in turn posing substantial threats to investor returns.</P><P>CDP says its aims with the <mark>carbon</mark> majors project are both to improve transparency among fossil fuel producers and to help investors understand the emissions associated with their fossil fuel holdings. </P><P>A fifth of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions are backed by public investment, according to the report. “That puts a significant responsibility on those investors to engage with <mark>carbon</mark> majors and urge them to disclose <mark>climate</mark> risk,” says Faria.</P><P>Investors should move out of fossil fuels, says Michael Brune, executive director of US environmental organisation the Sierra Club. “Not only is it morally risky, it’s economically risky.

</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P>There is a “growing wave of companies that are acting in the opposite manner to the companies in this report,” says Brune. Nearly 100 companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Ikea have committed to 100% renewable power under the <A href=""http://re100.org/companies"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">RE100 initiative</A>. <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/05/volvo-cars-electric-hybrid-2019"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Volvo recently announced</A> that all its cars would be electric or hybrid from 2019. </P><P>And oil and gas companies are also embarking on green investments. Shell set up <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/15/shell-creates-green-energy-division-to-invest-in-wind-power"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">a renewables arm</A> in 2015 with a $1.7bn investment attached and a spokesperson for Chevron says it’s “committed to managing its [greenhouse gas] emissions” and is investing in two of the world’s largest <A href=""http://www.afr.com/technology/gorgon-lng-project-to-show-business-case-for-<mark>carbon</mark>-waste-storage-20170618-gwtpk6"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""><mark>carbon</mark> dioxide injection</A><A href=""http://www.afr.com/technology/gorgon-lng-project-to-show-business-case-for-<mark>carbon</mark>-waste-storage-20170618-gwtpk6"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""> projects</A> to capture and store <mark>carbon</mark>. A BP spokesperson says its “determined to be part of the solution” for <mark>climate change</mark> and is “investing in renewables and low-<mark>carbon</mark> <mark>innovation</mark>.” And ExxonMobil, which has faced <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-<mark>climate</mark>-change-1981-<mark>climate</mark>-denier-funding"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">heavy criticism</A> for its environmental record, has been <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/21/oil-majors-investments-renewable-energy-solar-wind"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">exploring <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage</A>.</P><P>But for many the sums involved and pace of change are nowhere near enough. A research paper published last year by Paul Stevens, an academic at think tank Chatham House, said international oil companies were no longer fit for purpose and warned these multinationals that they faced a <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/oil-firms-environment-energy-<mark>climate</mark>-change"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">“nasty, brutish and short” end</A> within the next 10 years if they did not completely change their business models. </P><P>Investors now have a choice, according to Charlie Kronick, senior programme advisor at Greenpeace UK. “The future of the oil industry has already been written: the choice is will its decline be managed, returning capital to shareholders to be reinvested in the genuine industries of the future, or will they hold on, hoping not be the last one standing when the music stops?”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The Paris Agreement aims to keep global warming to a maximum limit of two-degree Celsius (about 3.8 degrees F.) above pre-industrial levels, with a goal of eventually lowering that even further to about 1.5 degrees. And it promises to cap global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions “as soon as possible.”</P><P>Morgan Stanley retains an “attractive” rating on European oil majors, arguing that short-term cyclical factors will outweigh the impact from the <mark>climate</mark> deal in next few years. But still, “there is little doubt that the Paris Agreement creates a long-term challenge to the business model.”</P><P>In public, companies linked to fossil fuels have brushed off worries about the <mark>climate</mark> deal, some regarding it as a small headache, compared with oil’s weak demand and overproduction, which have driven benchmark prices below $40 a barrel, their lowest level since 2008. One European utility company with coal assets <A href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/441249f2-a19e-11e5-8d70-42b68cfae6e4.html%20/l%20axzz3uONIXi31%20/t%20_blank"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">told the Financial Times</A>: “We are not too worried to be honest, it does not change much right now.”</P><P>But the phrase “right now” makes all the difference.</P><P>According to many of the 30,000 or so officials, business leaders, scientists, and activists who converged in Paris for the U.N.’s two-week <mark>climate</mark> talks, the 31-page Paris Agreement sets in motion a process in which countries will steadily cut their <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, eventually to a level dramatically lower than at present.</P><P>“It is impossible to believe that a fossil-fuel company thinks this is not significant,” says Mindy Lubber, President and CEO of the U.S. group Ceres, which lobbies investment firms and businesses about <mark>climate</mark> risks. “I can assure you, in the boardrooms they are diagnosing the impact of Paris and what it will mean for their bottom line,” she told <I>Fortune</I>.</P><P>Although Morgan Stanley’s note says oil and gas majors “still have a substantial period ahead in which they should be able to profitably invest,” it also says that could change around 2020, when the Paris Agreement’s impact begins to hit fossil-fuel companies.</P><P>One of the biggest risks, it says, will be so-called “stranded assets”—oil and gas reserves that companies list as part of their valuation, but that in reality might be worthless, since under the terms of the Paris Agreement those reserves might never be drilled. “The world’s known reserves are substantial, and some of those resources may need to be ‘left in the ground’ already,”says Morgan Stanley. “Although there is still need for field development, the need for exploration is therefore much less obvious in a ‘2 °C [two degrees Celsius] world.'”</P><P>That raises the question about the true future value of those oil and gas companies. That was the focus of discussion during the mammoth <mark>climate</mark> talks, in dozens of panel discussions and press briefings.</P><P>“A lot of fossil fuels are not going to be burned, that is clear,” Gérard Moutet, vice president for <mark>climate</mark>-energy for the French oil giant Total <A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""total-s-a"">(total-s-a)</A>, said on a panel on investment strategies last week. “Today is not like yesterday,” he said in a rare admission for an oil executive. “We will have to adapt.”</P><P>Former Vice President Al Gore told the panel that fossil-fuel companies could ultimately have “trillions of dollars of stranded <mark>carbon</mark> assets.”</P><P>Several bankers at the Paris meeting said they believe what is needed are regulations to compel financial firmsto declare what stocks within their holdings mights be liable to lose value, either because of some <mark>climate</mark> disaster, or because steady cutbacks in <mark>carbon</mark> emissions might undermine their value over time. </P><P>Midway through the Paris meeting, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney—a vocal presence at the event—launched a task force on <mark>climate</mark> financial risks, with ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg as its chair. Among its aims is to push financial firms to disclose their exposure to <mark>carbon</mark> stocks and <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Such disclosures have already begun in three major Western economies: </P><P>Starting next year, French public companies will have to disclose their plans for low <mark>carbon</mark> emission. Earlier this year, the Bank of England began requiring British insurance companies to declare their exposure to <mark>climate change</mark> risks. And American insurance companies are required to do the same in seven U.S. states: California, Connecticut, New York, Minnesota, New Mexico, and Washington.</P><P>Another initiative under discussion at the Paris meeting was the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project, a London-based organization that works to persuade companies to declare their <mark>carbon</mark> exposure and <mark>climate</mark> risks. “Our clients are become much more vocal around <mark>climate change</mark>,” Jay Ralph, chairman of Allianz Asset Management, which has $2 trillion under management, told a panel discussion in Paris, a day after the company signed on to the project. Ralph said Allianz would phase out coal assets and systematically examine the <mark>carbon</mark> exposure of its portfolios. “There is increasing interest in our partners to do something similar,” he said.</P><P>The trend is still small, compared to the estimated invested global capital of more than $100 trillion. But bankers and CEOs attending the Paris talks said they expect more and more companies to begin declaring their risks to <mark>climate change</mark>, and to the potential for limits on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions—something they say investors will increasingly want to know. “Not only is it in our vested interest, but it is also our responsibility,” Helena Vines-Fiestas, head of sustainability research at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said during one panel discussion in Paris. “We might breach our fiduciary duties if we do not so.”</P><P><EM>More from Fortune on the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Talks:</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The largest, most-consistent money fueling the <mark>climate</mark> denial movement are a number of well-funded conservative foundations built with so-called &quot;dark money,&quot; or concealed donations, according to an <A href=""http://drexel.edu/%7E/media/Files/now/pdfs/Institutionalizing%20Delay%20-%20Climatic%20Change.ashx"" target=""_blank"">analysis</A> released Friday afternoon.</P><P>
The study, by Drexel University environmental sociologist Robert Brulle, is the first academic effort to probe the organizational underpinnings and funding behind the <mark>climate</mark> denial movement.</P><P>
It found that the amount of money flowing through third-party, pass-through foundations like DonorsTrust and Donors Capital, whose funding cannot be traced, has risen dramatically over the past five years.</P><P>
In all, 140 foundations funneled $558 million to almost 100 <mark>climate</mark> denial organizations from 2003 to 2010.</P><P>
Meanwhile the traceable cash flow from more traditional sources, such as Koch Industries and ExxonMobil, has disappeared.</P><P>
The study was published Friday in the journal <EM><A href=""http://www.springer.com/earth+sciences+and+geography/atmospheric+sciences/journal/10584"" target=""_blank"">Climatic Change</A></EM>.</P><P>&quot;The <mark>climate change</mark> countermovement has had a real political and ecological impact on the failure of the world to act on global warming,&quot; Brulle said in a statement. &quot;Like a play on Broadway, the countermovement has stars in the spotlight  – often prominent contrarian scientists or conservative politicians – but behind the stars is an organizational structure of directors, script writers and producers.&quot;</P><P>&quot;If you want to understand what's driving this movement, you have to look at what's going on behind the scenes.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Consistent funders</STRONG>
To uncover that, Brulle developed a list of 118 influential <mark>climate</mark> denial organizations in the United States. He then coded data on philanthropic funding for each organization, combining information from the <A href=""http://foundationcenter.org/"" target=""_blank"">Foundation Center</A>, a database of global philanthropy, with financial data submitted by organizations to the Internal Revenue Service.</P><P>
According to Brulle, the largest and most consistent funders where a number of conservative foundations promoting &quot;ultra-free-market ideas&quot; in many realms, among them the Searle Freedom Trust, the John Williams Pope Foundation, the Howard Charitable Foundation and the Sarah Scaife Foundation.</P><P>
Another key finding: From 2003 to 2007, Koch Affiliated Foundations and the ExxonMobil Foundation were &quot;heavily involved&quot; in funding <mark>climate change</mark> denial efforts. But Exxon hasn't made a publically traceable contribution since 2008, and Koch's efforts dramatically declined, Brulle said.</P><P>
Coinciding with a decline in traceable funding, Brulle found a dramatic rise in the cash flowing to denial organizations from <A href=""http://www.donorstrust.org"" target=""_blank"">DonorsTrust</A>, a donor-directed foundation whose funders cannot be traced. This one foundation, the assessment found, now accounts for 25 percent of all traceable foundation funding used by organizations promoting the systematic denial of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>
Jeffrey Zysik, chief financial officer for DonorsTrust, said in an email that neither DonorsTrust nor Donors Capital Fund &quot;take positions with respect to any issue advocated by its grantees.&quot;</P><P>&quot;As with all donor-advised fund programs, grant recommendations are received from account holders,&quot; he said. &quot;DonorsTrust and Donors Capital Fund ensure that recommended grantees are IRS-approved public charities and also require that the grantee charities do not rely on significant amounts of revenue from government sources. DonorsTrust and Donors Capital Fund do not otherwise drive the selection of grantees, nor conduct in-depth analyses of projects or grantees unless an account holder specifically requests that service.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Matter of democracy</STRONG>
In the end, Brulle concluded public records identify only a fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars supporting <mark>climate</mark> denial efforts. Some 75 percent of the income of those organizations, he said, comes via unidentifiable sources.</P><P>
And for Brulle, that's a matter of democracy. &quot;Without a free flow of accurate information, democratic politics and government accountability become impossible,&quot; he said. &quot;Money amplifies certain voices above others and, in effect, gives them a megaphone in the public square.&quot;</P><P>
Powerful funders, he added, are supporting the campaign to deny scientific findings about global warming and raise doubts about the &quot;roots and remedies&quot; of a threat on which the science is clear.</P><P>&quot;At the very least, American voters deserve to know who is behind these efforts.&quot;</P><P><EM>Editor's Note (12/24/13): This story has been updated to reflect a late comment from DonorsTrust.</EM></P><P><EM>This article originally appeared on <A href=""http://www.daily<mark>climate</mark>.org/"" target=""_blank"">The Daily <mark>Climate</mark></A>, the <mark>climate change</mark> news source published by Environmental Health Sciences, a nonprofit media company.</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Since December 2015, many nations have <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-<mark>climate</mark>change-france-parisagreement/france-to-formally-ratify-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-accord-on-june-15-minister-idUSKCN0YW0OR"">ratified their commitment</A> to the Paris Accord, while one, the <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/un-<mark>climate</mark>-usa-paris/u-s-submits-formal-notice-of-withdrawal-from-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-pact-idUSL1N1KQ1UV"">United States</A>, has withdrawn from it. (In fact, the U.S. is now the world’s <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-<mark>climate</mark>change-accord-syria/syria-plans-to-join-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-agreement-isolating-u-s-idUSKBN1D71UN"">only nation not to support the accord</A>.)  </P><P>The Paris Accord was the culminating event that underscored conventional wisdom supporting the importance of environmental sustainability.  </P><P>Yet for many energy companies, being <mark>sustainable</mark> is no easy feat. The industry is, by its very nature, extremely <mark>carbon</mark> intensive. The exploration, drilling, extraction, processing and shipment of fossil-fuel-based products seem to pave the way for greenhouse gas emissions. </P><P><STRONG>Perspective to date</STRONG>Many large organizations have assessed the future challenges posed by <mark>climate change</mark>. Yet a majority of these organizations are just beginning to make strategic shifts to a lower-<mark>carbon</mark> future. Despite this, there are some that see opportunity in this new paradigm.</P><P>These are the companies that are starting to diversity and de<mark>carbon</mark>ize their business models. Their plans, many of which started over a decade ago, are producing positive business results and providing a pathway to a profitable low-<mark>carbon</mark> future that stretches to 2050 and beyond.  </P><P><STRONG>Total</STRONG>France’s Total S.A. (Total) is the fourth largest publicly held oil and gas company in the world and a contributor to GHG emissions. Yet Total, <A href=""http://tr.com/top100energy"">a Top 100 energy leader</A>, is also widely recognized among fossil fuel companies for its vision of a new clean-energy future and its progress in adapting a large, complex business for that future.</P><P>Total’s <mark>climate</mark>-related efforts can be traced back more than a decade, with its initial recognition of the challenges that <mark>climate change</mark> poses for a major energy company and the need to address them.  </P><P><STRONG>The timeline</STRONG>In 2006, Total was one of the first major fossil fuel companies to publicly acknowledge the importance of <mark>climate change</mark> as a global risk. Its initial efforts focused on implementing cost-effective approaches to reduce flaring gas emissions.</P><P>By 2008, Total led other major oil companies in systematic reporting of GHG and <mark>climate</mark>-related performance metrics, including product use, and included initial target setting for improvements in the company’s operational footprint.  </P><P>In 2009, Total launched EcoSolutions, its low-<mark>carbon</mark> products and services portfolio. With a series of investments, including SunPower (solar), Saft (battery design), Stem (energy optimization) and BHC Energy (operational energy efficiency), Total committed to shifting its revenue base toward <mark>sustainable</mark> energy solutions.  </P><P>In 2014, under the leadership of Patrick Pouyanne, Total’s Chairman and CEO, the company fully articulated its strategy to differentiate itself from other oil companies. Going forward, Total is building its future business on three strategic pillars:  </P><P>1. Reducing the <mark>carbon</mark> intensity in its fossil fuel product mix  </P><P>2. Investing judiciously in <mark>carbon</mark> capture, utilization and storage technologies  </P><P>3. Expanding its business base in “renewable,” including production, storage and distribution of clean energy and biofuels  </P><P><STRONG>In 2015, Total exited the coal business.</STRONG>Total’s 2016 reorganization had a strong focus on renewables and low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy solutions, setting policy support and goals aligned with the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>’s (IPCC) 2°C target.</P><P>If Total is to realize the full potential of its competitive advantage in the energy sector, it will need to continue to demonstrate viable de<mark>carbon</mark>ization pathways consistent with the 2-degree boundary. This will require continued rapid growth of its EcoSolutions portfolio revenues and leadership among the oil companies as they address the potential challenge of stranded assets, oil reserves that could go unutilized or be “stranded” due to the evolving strategic <mark>climate</mark> landscape.  </P><P><STRONG>Reduced GHG Impacts</STRONG>Total reduced emissions over the last three years well ahead of IPCC guidance, with an approximate 20 percent aggregate decline (or roughly 130 million tons) in total GHG emissions across all scopes. And while emissions declined, Total’s <mark>carbon</mark> intensity saw a 9.2 percent average annual rate of decline in GHG / BOE (greenhouse gas emissions/barrel of oil equivalent), between 2013 and 2016, or a cumulative decline of 27.5 percent from the baseline year of 2013. Both aggregate emissions and the GHG intensity of its footprint are falling significantly.</P><P>As Total continues to extend its <mark>climate</mark> impact with more renewable and low-<mark>carbon</mark> solutions, the increasing value of its transformed green-product portfolio is likely to significantly outpace the potential declining value of its traditional high-<mark>carbon</mark> products.  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

As Andrew Revkin <A class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""http://issues.org/32-2/my-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" title="""" target=""_blank"">wrote</A> last year about his storied career as an environmental reporter at The Times, “I saw a widening gap between what scientists had been learning about global warming and what advocates were claiming as they pushed ever harder to pass <mark>climate</mark> legislation.” The science was generally scrupulous. The boosters who claimed its authority weren’t.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-1bytduc emamhsk0""><DIV class=""css-w71pwo emamhsk2""><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Anyone who has read the <A class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf"" title="""" target=""_blank"">2014 report</A> of the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> knows that, while the modest (0.85 degrees Celsius, or about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit) warming of the earth since 1880 is indisputable, as is the human influence on that warming, much else that passes as accepted fact is really a matter of probabilities. That’s especially true of the sophisticated but fallible models and simulations by which scientists attempt to peer into the <mark>climate</mark> future. To say this isn’t to deny science. It’s to acknowledge it honestly.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">By now I can almost hear the heads exploding. They shouldn’t, because there’s another lesson here — this one for anyone who wants to advance the cause of good <mark>climate policy</mark>. As Revkin wisely noted, hyperbole about <mark>climate</mark> “not only didn’t fit the science at the time but could even be counterproductive if the hope was to engage a distracted public.”</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Let me put it another way. Claiming total certainty about the science traduces the spirit of science and creates openings for doubt whenever a <mark>climate</mark> claim proves wrong. Demanding abrupt and expensive changes in public policy raises fair questions about ideological intentions. Censoriously asserting one’s moral superiority and treating skeptics as imbeciles and deplorables wins few converts.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">None of this is to deny <mark>climate change</mark> or the possible severity of its consequences. But ordinary citizens also have a right to be skeptical of an overweening scientism. They know — as all environmentalists should — that history is littered with the human wreckage of scientific errors married to political power.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">I’ve taken the epigraph for this column from the Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz, who knew something about the evils of certitude. Perhaps if there had been less certitude and more second-guessing in Clinton’s campaign, she’d be president. Perhaps if there were less certitude about our <mark>climate</mark> future, more Americans would be interested in having a reasoned conversation about it.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""bottom-of-article""><DIV class=""Addendum-addendums--1F9r3""><DIV class=""Addendum-item--3Si_o""><STRONG class=""Addendum-type--uYTDD"">Correction:</STRONG> <DIV class=""Addendum-body--zYQjt"">An earlier version of this article misstated the area that warmed by 0.85 degrees Celsius as noted in the 2014 Intergovernmental Panel report.

The United States government has spent enormous sums on global warming/<mark>climate change</mark> issues, including science research, although the ocean of funding is so large, fed by so many rivers of tax dollars, that it’s hard to tally it all up.</P><P>Not all of this government funding goes to advocacy of <mark>climate</mark> alarmism, of course. But it would be hard for the federal government to spends <EM>billions</EM> of dollars a year on a controversial topic, with every penny of the spending based on the presumption that global warming is a serious crisis worthy of billions of tax dollars, and not have those billions make a powerful impression on the public. The persons in the public who would be most powerfully affected would be those hoping to obtain grants for their research, or tax subsidies for their businesses, or otherwise seeking to benefit from going along with the presumption that a crisis exists. Tens of billions of dollars are not exactly a small incentive, and as Robert Brulle said in the press release for his study, “Money amplifies certain voices above others and, in effect, gives them a megaphone in the public square.”<SPAN class=""easy-footnote""><A href=""#easy-footnote-bottom-1"" title=""&lt;a href=&quot;http://drexel.edu/now/archive/2013/december/<mark>climate</mark>-change/#sthash.XUpcCmxp.dpuf&quot;&gt;http://drexel.edu/now/archive/2013/december/<mark>climate</mark>-change/#sthash.XUpcCmxp.dpuf&lt;/a&gt;""><SUP>1</SUP></A></SPAN></P><P>The data provided here comes primarily from two government sources: (1) the Government Accountability Office (GAO), using data from the Office of Management and Budget; and (2) the Congressional Research Service (CRS). The GAO report covers Fiscal Years 1993 to 2010; the CRS report covers FY 2008 to 2014 (with FY 2014 estimated). The funding expenditures not only include regular annual budgeted amounts, but also large additional funding provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, also known as the “Stimulus Bill,” signed into law by President Obama in 2009. The Stimulus sent more than $26.1 billion in funding toward <mark>climate change</mark> programs, of which the GAO estimates about 2.5%, or $641 million, went to <mark>climate</mark> science.</P><P>Accounting for all these government billions is further complicated by international transfers from various U.S. government entities to international groups like the U.N. In 2016, questions arose in Congress about the legality of recent transfers, such as those sent to the U.N. Green <mark>Climate</mark> Fund. But my analysis will stop as of September 30, 2016, the end of FY 2016, before serious questions were raised about such transfers.</P><P>Additional complications arise from definitions of the various categories of spending included in the reports. For example, the summary of the 2011 GAO report states: “OMB reports funding in four categories: technology to reduce emissions, science to better understand <mark>climate change</mark>, international assistance for developing countries, and wildlife adaptation to respond to actual or expected changes.”</P><P>In addition, the summary reports that there are no clear definitions across agencies. Thus, the estimates are educated guesses, at best. I group these educated guesses of expenditures into two categories: (1) <mark>climate</mark> science; and (2) “other,” including efforts to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions and their presumed, but not demonstrated, effects.</P><P>More uncertainty in the numbers arises from the fact that the GAO report is based on a survey conducted from August 6, 2010, to September 24, 2010. “Of the 106 officials who were asked to participate, 73 responded to the questionnaire, for a response rate of about 69 percent.”</P><P>Several types of funding are covered in the broad classification of federal expenditures. Actual funding, or cash outlays, is a fairly clear type of support, and for this analysis, the actual or the enacted budget authority is used, except for 2014, where the requested amount is used.</P><P>But less clear are the second and third categories of federal support, because they involve tax expenditures. “Tax expenditures” are estimates of tax revenues that the government “loses” when the tax code allows taxpayers to reduce their gross income with specific deductions to arrive at a lower “adjusted gross income.”</P><P>And so economists typically say that the largest U.S. tax expenditure is the mortgage deduction for personal homes. But these kind of “expenditures” are generally not transferable and simply reduce the income that citizens’ report, which may or may not reduce anyone’s tax bill. Another form of tax expenditures are federal tax credits, which can be transferable. Generally, tax credits are used by corporations with large federal tax burdens to directly reduce the taxes they pay. In this analysis, I will calculate federal revenues lost, largely from tax credits, according to the numbers in the government reports from the GAO and CRS. These “expenditures” fall into the category of “other”—efforts to reduce greenhouse gases and their presumed effects. These expenditures are not included in the <mark>Climate</mark> Science category.</P><P>No reports to Congress from a government agency were found for the periods after Fiscal Year 2014, which ended on September 30, 2014. The amount for Fiscal Year 2014 is an estimate, and to cover FY 2015 and 2016, one must examine agency budgets, a tedious process. Further, in recent years the accounting for many agencies has become obtuse, with monies moving among entities for various purposes without notification to Congress. The complications are made worse because there have been no rigorous government agency audits in several decades. A 2015 report from the Government Accountability Office states:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“Three major impediments prevented GAO from rendering an opinion on the federal government’s accrual-based consolidated financial statements: (1) serious financial management problems at the Department of Defense (DOD), (2) the federal government’s inability to adequately account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and balances between federal entities, and (3) the federal government’s ineffective process for preparing the consolidated financial statements. Efforts are under way to resolve these issues, but strong and sustained commitment by DOD and other federal entities as well as continued leadership by the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) are necessary to implement needed improvements.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>This pathetic status of government accounting limits the reporting of federal expenditures on <mark>climate</mark> issues for years after FY 2013, which is why the numbers provided here for FY 2014 are estimated. After 2014, the budget for <mark>climate</mark> science spending by one entity is available: the U.S. Global Change Research Program. The expenditures of other government entities are clouded, and so for <mark>climate</mark> science only a minimum expenditure can be established—the actual amount may be significantly greater. For other <mark>climate change</mark> programs, the amounts are not generally available.</P><H3><SPAN id=""The_Numbers"">The Numbers</SPAN></H3><P>From FY 1993 to FY 2014, government reports show that annual spending on “<mark>climate</mark> science” grew from $1.31 billion to $2.66 billon, for a total of $42.49 billion. Of this total, $0.64 billion came from the stimulus bill. Annual expenditures in this category over the period increased over 200%. During the same period, “other” <mark>climate</mark>-related expenditures (including tax credits) grew from $1.05 billion to $8.94 billion, for a total of $104.29 billion, with $25.5 billion coming from AARA. The increase in annual expenditures in this category was 850%.</P><P>If we combine both categories, total expenditures for the period grew from $2.35 billion to $11.59 billion, for a total of $146.78 billion, with $26.14 billion coming from ARRA. The increase in total annual expenditures was 490%.</P><P>The amount going to international assistance via UN groups grew from $201 million to $893 million in 2014—a 440% growth in annual expenditures.</P><P>When the budgets for FY 2015 &amp; FY 2016 of the U.S. Global Change Research Program are included, the total expenditures for “<mark>climate</mark> science” from FY 1993 to FY 2016 come to $47.56 billion, with international assistance amounting to $8.24 billion.</P><P><STRONG>Constant Dollars</STRONG>: While the CRS report also gave the total annual expenditures of <mark>climate change</mark> in constant 2012 dollars, the GAO report did not give constant dollars. Since the index used by the CRS is not available on the web, I’ve used the Consumer Price Index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to adjust GAO numbers to 2012 constant dollars. To assure a reasonable adjustment, several calculations were double-checked with CRS numbers. The error in the match sets was less than 1%.</P><H3><SPAN id=""Conclusion"">Conclusion</SPAN></H3><P>After examining the reports, and removing double counting, calculations show that from Fiscal Year 1993 to FY 2014 <STRONG>total U.S. expenditures on <mark>climate change</mark> amount to more than $166 billion in 2012 dollars</STRONG>. By way of comparison, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the entire Apollo program, operating from 1962 to 1973 with 17 missions—seven of them sending men to the moon and back—cost $170 billion in 2005 dollars, which equals about $200 billion in 2012 dollars, if we use the Consumer Price Index to adjust that figure. In “fighting” <mark>climate change</mark>, the United States government is spending almost as much as it did on all the Apollo missions.</P><P><EM>Kenneth Haapala is president of the Science and Environmental Policy Project and a contributor to the reports of the Nongovernmental International Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (NIPCC). He is an energy and economics modeler and past president of the oldest science society of Washington.</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

In this study, high-resolution paleo-climatic data have been used to explore at a macroscale the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on the outbreak of war and population decline in the preindustrial era. We show that long-term fluctuations of war frequency and population changes followed the cycles of temperature change. Further analyses show that cooling impeded agricultural production, which brought about a series of serious social problems, including price inflation, then successively war outbreak, famine, and population decline successively. The findings suggest that worldwide and synchronistic war–peace, population, and price cycles in recent centuries have been driven mainly by long-term <mark>climate change</mark>. The findings also imply that social mechanisms that might mitigate the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> were not significantly effective during the study period. <mark>Climate change</mark> may thus have played a more important role and imposed a wider ranging effect on human civilization than has so far been suggested.

The concept of environmental conflict has been suggested by several researchers, but they focus only on conflicts caused by short-term <mark>climate</mark> variations and meteorological events (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-6"" id=""xref-ref-6-1"">6</A>–<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-9"" id=""xref-ref-9-1"">9</A>). Galloway (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-10"" id=""xref-ref-10-1"">10</A>) found that long-term <mark>climate change</mark> controlled population size in middle-latitude areas. However, his finding lacked quantitative precision because of the absence of high-resolution <mark>climate</mark> records at the time. We studied a long span of Chinese history and found that the number of war outbreaks and population collapses in China is significantly correlated with Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperature variations and that all of the periods of nationwide unrest, population collapse, and dynastic change occurred in the cold phases of this period (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-11"" id=""xref-ref-11-1"">11</A>–<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-13"" id=""xref-ref-13-1"">13</A>). As a result of recent scientific breakthroughs in establishing more precise paleo-climatic records [see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1"">supporting information (SI) <EM>Text</EM></A>], we extend the earlier study to the global and continental levels between A.D. 1400 and A.D. 1900, during the Little Ice Age (LIA; see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1""><EM>SI Text</EM></A>).</P><P id=""p-7"">The hypothesis we propose posits that long-term <mark>climate change</mark> has significant direct effects on land-carrying capacity (as measured by agricultural production). Fluctuation of the carrying capacity in turn affects the food supply per capita. A shortage of food resources in populated areas increases the likelihood of armed conflicts, famines, and epidemics, events that thus reduce population size. As a feedback mechanism, population decline has a dominant tendency to increase the food supply per capita (seen in decreasing food prices), which results in relative peace and fast population growth. The interactions among these components in a social system create an important rhythm of macrohistory in agricultural societies. The simplified pathways of the above chain reactions and feedback loops are represented in <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1"">SI Fig. 3</A>.</P><P id=""p-8"">With respect to the character of the causal pathways, the relation between <mark>climate</mark> and agricultural production has been demonstrated by many empirical studies (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-10"" id=""xref-ref-10-2"">10</A>, <A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-14"" id=""xref-ref-14-1"">14</A>). Under ecological stress, adaptive choices for animal species are the reduction of population size, migration, and dietary change. Depopulation typically takes place through starvation and cannibalism. Humans have more pathways, social mechanisms, to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark> and mitigate ecological stress. Besides migration, they include warfare, economic change, <mark>innovation</mark>, trade, and peaceful resource redistribution. We believe that in late agrarian society established political boundaries in populated areas limited mass migration; the result of such mass migration, when it occurred, often was war. Economic change was a costly and slow process that involved changing cultures, technologies, and habits. When the speed of human <mark>innovation</mark> and its transfer were not fast enough to keep pace with rapid ecological change, famine and disease became difficult to avoid. Trade and redistribution under the condition of shrinking resources would not help much because the ecological stress was at a global or very large regional scale. Finally, human social development in the form of international and national institutions was not strong enough to buffer the tensions caused by food resource scarcity. Therefore, war and population decline became common consequences of <mark>climate</mark>-induced ecological stress in the late preindustrial era. Recent developments in resource and environmental studies (e.g., refs. <A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-8"" id=""xref-ref-8-2"">8</A>, <A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-9"" id=""xref-ref-9-2"">9</A>, <A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-15"" id=""xref-ref-15-1"">15</A>, and <A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-16"" id=""xref-ref-16-1"">16</A>) suggest that limited resources and environmental degradation would have caused armed conflicts in human history. However, these perceived <mark>climate</mark>–war–population decline sequences have never been substantiated with scientific evidence consisting of long-term time series. In the following sections, we verify our hypothesis and evaluate the role of <mark>climate change</mark> on war outbreak and population decline with empirical data at global and continental scales.</P><DIV class=""section results-discussion"" id=""sec-1""><H2>Results and Discussion</H2><P id=""p-9"">We adopted a quantitative and macrohistorical approach to explore the <mark>climate</mark>–agriculture–war–population relationships depicted in <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1"">SI Fig. 3</A> in the preindustrial era.

It can be seen that all war peaks (&gt;25 wars per decade) occurred in a cold <mark>climate</mark>, and multiple war–peace cycles were followed closely the NH's temperature variations (see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1"">SI Fig. 5</A>). The temperature–war correlation is also statistically significant, and population declines followed every high war peak (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-12"" id=""xref-ref-12-2"">12</A>, <A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-13"" id=""xref-ref-13-2"">13</A>). Krus <EM>et al.</EM> (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-19"" id=""xref-ref-19-1"">19</A>) also examined frequency of Chinese wars and found that the periods that non-Confucian ethical systems dominated China had more wars. However, the periods often were cold and dry, and such <mark>climate</mark> drove the northern and western tribal states to enter central China, thus changing original Confucian ethical systems.</P><P id=""p-15"">At the century timescale, war frequencies and the ratio of wars per year in different centuries have been calculated at global and continental geographic scales. Those calculations demonstrate that the number and ratio of wars in the 18th century are the lowest compared with other centuries. The results indicate that the worldwide war ratio during cold centuries was 1.93 times greater than that of the mild 18th century, and 1.77, 1.91, 1.50 and 2.24 times greater for the NH, Asia, the arid areas of the NH, and Europe, respectively. At the country scale, as the incidence of warfare has been too small to permit correlation analysis to be conducted, the number of wars in each century was calculated and the ratios of wars per year were compared. These calculations show that only 27 of 170 countries and areas around the world had higher war ratios in the 18th century than in the 15–17th and 19th centuries. Most of the “exceptional cases” are located near the Equator, where there was no obvious LIA, and thus cooling that would have a significant effect on agriculture.</P><P id=""p-16"">To refine the analysis, a series of correlation analyses were carried out at the much lower scale of an annual level timeframe. Although the SH had no obvious LIA, the temperature anomaly for the SH was used for comparative purposes in the correlation analysis by examining the temperature and war frequency relationship. The results show that the numbers of wars per year, in all war classifications, were significantly negatively correlated with the annual changes of the temperature anomalies at the global level (see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1"">SI Table 3</A>). The number of wars in the NH and SH also correlated significantly with their temperature variations. The reliability of the correlation analysis was verified by a cross-examination method that deliberately correlates the war frequency of a particular hemisphere or region with the other hemisphere's temperature anomaly. The results show that all correlation coefficients of these “mismatched” combinations were either insignificant or very low positive. For instance, the correlation coefficients between the SH temperature anomaly and NH war frequency were −0.06 for A.D. 1400–1900 and 0.137 for A.D. 1500–1900, respectively. This finding suggests that the strikingly high coefficients of our correlation analysis are by no means accidental, and the number of wars in each hemisphere is related only to its own temperature variation. Further analysis of the frequency of wars in Europe, Asia, and the arid areas of the NH also shows significant correlations with the NH temperature anomaly for their geographical patterns (see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1"">SI Table 3</A>).</P><P id=""p-17"">The values of the coefficients at the annual scale also reflect environmental vulnerability and population density, which could further verify our hypothesis. As arid regions are the most vulnerable to <mark>climate change</mark>, the highest coefficient should and does appear in the war frequencies for the arid areas of the NH. Values are lower for Asia, probably because much of the continent for which there is conflict data is subject to a wet tropical or subtropical environment, where a fall in temperature would have a smaller effect than elsewhere on agricultural production and would not reduce food resources to the same extent because there is more alternative food. The American continents had a very low population density and a large amount of fertile land during this period, and its values are therefore either insignificant or of very low significance. Europe and Africa have either large cold areas or desert areas relatively vulnerable to cooling, and we find that warfare there is highly correlated with the temperature anomalies. At the global scale, the temperature anomaly is simply an arithmetic mean of the NH and SH temperature anomalies (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-17"" id=""xref-ref-17-3"">17</A>). The values of the coefficient for wars at the global scale are thus lower than those of the NH and SH alone.</P><H3>Population Growth.</H3><P id=""p-18"">The ecological stress triggered by <mark>climate change</mark> induces population shrinkage of most species, including human beings. Johnson and Gould (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-20"" id=""xref-ref-20-1"">20</A>) demonstrated that the agricultural production of Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) closely followed its changing <mark>climate</mark>, which led to periodic collapses of its population by famine and wars (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-20"" id=""xref-ref-20-2"">20</A>). Using the best available world population estimates extending back to A.D. 1000, we compared the NH temperature series with the NH population growth rate. We also included the data series defining the spatial extent of cooling in the NH for reference (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-21"" id=""xref-ref-21-1"">21</A>) (see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1"">SI Fig. 6</A>). Variations in the population growth rate can be divided into three periods. In A.D. 1000–1400, when agricultural technology and trade flows were at a low level, the population growth rate was also low, and the world population basically stagnated. Because of the gradual temperature drop and the increase in size of the cold area from the “Medieval Warm Period” to the LIA, the growth rate also decreased concomitantly. Every sudden temperature drop would induce a “demographic shock,” and the correlation coefficient between the NH temperature and the population growth rate (in 20-year units) is highly significant in this period (<EM>r</EM> = 0.84, <EM>P</EM>&lt; 0.001, <EM>n</EM> = 21) as agriculture largely depended on <mark>climate</mark>. The growth rate reached its lowest level in the 13–14th centuries, primarily because of epidemics, wars, and famines. In China, the invasion by the Mongols in the 13–14th centuries was related to the ecological stress caused by cooling, which reduced China's total population nearly by half (≈55 million decline) (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-22"" id=""xref-ref-22-1"">22</A>). In Europe, Black Death spread out during the time, which was accompanied by massive social unrest and economic collapse (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-23"" id=""xref-ref-23-1"">23</A>, <A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-24"" id=""xref-ref-24-1"">24</A>), which wiped out a quarter to one-third of the population in A.D. 1347–1353, the coldest period in the last several hundred years (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-24"" id=""xref-ref-24-2"">24</A>). At first glance, a cold <mark>climate</mark> did nothing to foster plague. However, cooling, according to our model, would cause wars, forced migration, or even famine, which would help to spread out the “vectors.” In China, historical statistics also reveal that a cold <mark>climate</mark> has been accompanied by more epidemics (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-25"" id=""xref-ref-25-1"">25</A>).</P><P id=""p-19"">The second period is A.D. 1400–1700. The first part of this period coincided with a warm phase and the beginning of the “Early Modern Times,” and the NH population growth rate rose rapidly. The population growth rate stayed at an elevated level from A.D. 1400 to 1600, despite a short cooling beginning in the middle of the 15th century. This phenomenon can probably be explained by three factors: (<EM>i</EM>) a large portion of the north hemispheric land area was not affected by the cooling (see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1"">SI Fig. 6<EM>C</EM></A>); (<EM>ii</EM>) improvements in trade in the Renaissance Era; and (<EM>iii</EM>) fewer large magnitude wars during this period (<A class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"" id=""xref-fig-1-4"">Fig. 1</A><EM>C</EM>). However, when the coldest and also lengthiest epoch of the LIA took place (17th century), more wars of great magnitude and the associated population declines in Europe and Asia (especially China) followed (<A class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"" id=""xref-fig-1-5"">Fig. 1</A><EM>D</EM>). The European population was devastated by possibly the worst war in its history in terms of the share of the population killed in A.D. 1618–1648 (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-24"" id=""xref-ref-24-3"">24</A>), starvation, and epidemics. In China, the population plummeted 43% (≈70 million) because of wars, starvation and epidemics in A.D. 1620–1650 (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-22"" id=""xref-ref-22-2"">22</A>). The rapid “postshock” bounce of the population growth rate in the late 17th century was related to the dramatically reduced population size and the coupled increase of food supply per capita. A more efficient resource distribution caused by technological and social advance in Europe might have also played a role.</P><P id=""p-20"">A dramatic increase in human population occurred in the last two centuries of the LIA because of the Industrial and Agricultural revolutions, especially in Europe. However, a cooling period that covered a relatively larger area in the mid-19th century still caused a worldwide demographic shock, in part because of the prevalence of warfare in different continents (<A class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"" id=""xref-fig-1-6"">Fig. 1</A>).</P><P id=""p-21"">Annual-scale analysis for the period A.D. 1400–1900, which has higher-resolution population data, could help verify the above hypothesis. Correlation analysis showed a very significant relationship between the NH temperature swings and population growth rates for the world, NH, Asia, North America, and Europe, as well as China (see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1"">SI Table 4</A>). As expected, the correlation coefficients for Europe and North America are lower than the others. The reason is that Europeans and Americans lived in an ecologically open system since the Industrial Revolution in which European population pressure could be relieved by cross-continental colonization and migration. When the 19th century (the age of Great Migration in Europe) population data were not included in the analysis, the correlations for Europe and North America were almost as high as those for Asia and the whole NH. Similarly, the large-scale trans-Atlantic migration from Europe to North America in A.D. 1700–1900, which is supposed to be driven by cooling, can also be substantiated by the significant negative correlation between the NH temperature anomaly and North America's population growth (<EM>r</EM> = −0.341, <EM>P</EM>&lt; 0.001, <EM>n</EM> = 201).</P><H3>European and Chinese Cases.</H3><P id=""p-22"">The above results have shown significant correlations and coincident timing between temperature change, war frequency, and population growth rate in different temporal and spatial scales. The analyses also indicate that cooling may have contributed to widely separated human disasters during the cold periods. The paths to those disasters operated through a reduction in agricultural production. The reduction is mainly because the cooling brought about a shortening of the growing season and a reduction of available land for cultivation. Shortages of food resources (reflected in price rises) instigated conflicts and demographic declines. To illustrate the relationship between temperature change and other factors in our pathways, we present figures that show successive fluctuations of those factors in Europe and China in A.D. 1500–1800 (<A class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"" id=""xref-fig-2-1"">Fig. 2</A>). Only those two regions have relatively long-span historical records of the factors, and both shared ≈60% of the total world population during that time. China here refers to current territories of the People's Republic of China, including so-called China proper, part of Outer China, and some tribal states of China. Regarding the time span, Europe before A.D. 1500 did not have any effective market-pricing mechanisms (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-26"" id=""xref-ref-26-1"">26</A>), whereas the Industrial Revolution in Europe spread out after A.D. 1800. To see the real influence of nature, the upward trends in agricultural production, population size, cereal prices, and war frequency, which were caused by technological development during the period, have been detrended in <A class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"" id=""xref-fig-2-2"">Fig. 2</A>.</P><DIV class=""fig"" id=""F2""><DIV class=""highwire-figure""><UL class=""highwire-figure-links inline""><LI class=""download-ppt last""><A href=""/highwire/powerpoint/256756"" class=""highwire-figure-link highwire-figure-link-ppt"" data-icon-position="""" data-hide-link-title=""0"">Download powerpoint</A></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class=""fig-caption""><SPAN class=""fig-label"">Fig. 2.</SPAN><P id=""p-23"" class=""first-child"">Paleo-temperature variation and its impact on Europe and China, A.D. 1500–1800.

As this data series is only in 50-year intervals, we estimated the annual agricultural production index by using cereal prices and population sizes. The estimated values matched closely with the temperature and real grain yield trajectories, which imply that temperature change definitely controlled agricultural production during that period. The most surprising finding is that the fluctuations of all of the components are the same in terms of macrotrends, turning points, and oscillation magnitude for both Europe and China at a time when both regions were detached, economically, politically, and geographically (<A class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"" id=""xref-fig-2-4"">Fig. 2</A><EM>B</EM>–<EM>E</EM>). The most important aspect of this finding is that the fluctuations of all of the factors were in a successive order and corresponded to the temperature change. When agricultural production went down, wheat prices went up in both Europe and China. When prices reached a certain level, more wars erupted. Population growth rates were influenced by both war frequency and food supply per capita (reflected in cereal prices) and dramatically dropped to negative values when agricultural production was at its lowest levels, cereal prices reached their highest level, and peaks in war frequency occurred. Such a human ecological and social disaster reduced population sizes and even caused catastrophic population collapses in both Europe and China in the 17th century. The period is then called the General Crisis of the 17th Century. Research on biological living standards of ancient Europeans also support our data and analysis; the average height of Europeans in the 17th century is the shortest during the last two millennia and was 2 cm shorter than those in 16th and 18th centuries (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-27"" id=""xref-ref-27-1"">27</A>). After the slump in population size, food supply per capita increased (as reflected in decreased prices), and the incidence of war in the late 17th century declined even as the <mark>climate</mark> was cold and agriculture production was still low. Such a feedback effect can also be seen in Europe in the late 18th century. Although the <mark>climate</mark> was mild and agricultural production was high, the rapid increase in population dampened the food supply per capita (prices increased), and then the number of wars started to go up. The feedback mechanism explains why there were time gaps between the turning points of temperature variation and the war–peace cycles in various NH continents in the late 17th and late 18th centuries (<A class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"" id=""xref-fig-1-7"">Fig. 1</A><EM>B</EM>).

The coincidence of multiple war–peace cycles and population decreases worldwide at various temporal scales is unlikely to be accidental. It has been shown that elevated levels of war outbreak and population decline in populated areas occurred during a cold <mark>climate</mark> in the past millennium. Europe and China are strong cases to illustrate that the links and feedback effects between temperature change and social events, long-term cycles of war outbreak and population decline, originate in large part from a fundamental driver, <mark>climate change</mark>. All of the above analytical results indicate that war and depopulation have been the important adaptive choices in preindustrial society. The results also have implications for the following outstanding issues.</P><H3>Other Pathways for Human Adaptation.</H3><P id=""p-26"">Our quantitative results also show the importance of the roles of some other human adaptive choices in mitigating war outbreak and population decline. At the country and local scales, these social mechanisms might have lessened, postponed, or even eliminated on occasion war outbreak and population declines during bouts of mild or short cooling. For instance, before A.D. 1400, war outbreaks and population decreases in China immediately followed every decline of temperature (see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1"">SI Fig. 5</A>). After then, the short cooling in the 15th century did not generate a period of war outbreak and population decline, and the times of war outbreak and population decrease in response to great temperature declines were postponed by ≈30 years in the 17th and 19th centuries, possibly because of the work of institutions and technological development. After A.D. 1700, the base level of war frequency in China decreased because the Qing emperors had united all troublesome tribal states in the western and northern marginal areas (see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1"">SI Fig. 5<EM>B</EM></A>).</P><P id=""p-27"">In the long run and at a global scale, technological and social development raised the population growth rate by 30% for A.D. 1400–1700 and 310% during A.D. 1700–1900, compared with the A.D. 1000–1400 period (<A class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"" id=""xref-fig-1-8"">Fig. 1</A><EM>D</EM>). It also reduced <mark>climate</mark> dependence of growth rate of population (after A.D. 1400), postponed the time of population decrease, and accelerated subsequent population recovery. For instance, the demographic shocks in the NH before A.D. 1400 have no time delays between the population growth rate drops and the temperature drops, but afterward the shocks are delayed by 20 and 40 years, respectively, in the 17th and 19th centuries (see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1"">SI Fig. 6</A>). The gradual increase in time delays for NH population declines as we moved into the modern era may reflect that at least some social mechanisms may becoming more effective over time at the macroscale. We cannot evaluate quantitatively the relative importance of these mechanisms because measurement of these parameters is not feasible with current data sources. However, these adaptive choices that are positive to humanity have not let the human race escape from social calamities such as population collapse caused by severe cooling at both the global and continental scales as shown in the history of the past millennium. For armed conflict, the positive social mechanisms could neither reduce the number of wars nor indefinitely postpone the times of war outbreak in any cooling periods. However, the change of economy after A.D. 1900 (the change of basic resources in industrial society) had made that the great conflicts and demographic shocks were to only a limited extent affected by agricultural production at a global scale.</P><H3>Cycle Theories.</H3><P id=""p-28"">Many social scientists have noted cycles of social order and disorder in history, in which downturn periods were characterized by inflation, a fall in real wages, political crisis, war, and state breakdown (<A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1""><EM>SI Text</EM></A> and refs. <A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-28"" id=""xref-ref-28-1"">28</A> and <A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-29"" id=""xref-ref-29-1"">29</A>). There are many theories and hypotheses that attempt to explain this type of crisis and the dynamics behind the cyclical pattern of history (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-24"" id=""xref-ref-24-5"">24</A>). They have told us much about the dynamics behind the cycles. However, those models cannot explain parallel occurrence of these crises in widely separated regions that were in different stages of civilization, culture, and resource endowment, nor predict the timing of such crises. The agrarian and environmental models are similar to our model. But because there were no high-resolution paleo-temperature reconstructions at the time these models were proposed, and the explanations in these models lack population feedback, the models are not entirely convincing.</P><H3>Demographic Theories.</H3><P id=""p-29"">Malthus, as well as Darwin and many other ecologists, who state that “positive checks” occur when population growth overshoots the level of livelihood resources based on the assumption that the level of resources needed for basic livelihood is essentially constant or possibly monotonically increasing, is only partly correct (see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1""><EM>SI Text</EM></A>). However, our results show that the level of those livelihood resources (food) will, at best, increase in an oscillating, not always positive, manner because the impact of <mark>climate change</mark>, and population growth was not. An anti-Malthusian, Boserup (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-30"" id=""xref-ref-30-1"">30</A>), claimed that population pressure would lead to the growth of agricultural production. She is correct with respect to limited scale regions and short-term timeframes if the land still has potential for intensive cultivation or for a very long-term trend concerning human history. However, such intensive cultivation could not keep pace with the needs of a growing population during periods when the <mark>climate</mark> cooled in Europe and China, as can be seen in various European economic records and the evidence from this study.</P><H3>War Theories.</H3><P id=""p-30"">War is, no doubt, an extremely complicated social phenomenon, and many scholars have investigated the problem of the causes of war since the days of Thucydides (<A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1""><EM>SI Text</EM></A> and ref. <A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-31"" id=""xref-ref-31-1"">31</A>). Sadly, scholars have made at best modest progress on the problem even though members of all of the social sciences have addressed it (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-32"" id=""xref-ref-32-1"">32</A>). Some of these theories may explain certain wars, and some of the theories may even explain sizable classes of wars, but none of them can explain the temporal and spatial patterns of warfare presented above. Our approach has not been to examine causes of individual wars, but to investigate the frequency of all wars during a specific period of human history and find out when, where, and why the war–peace cycles occurred. Our results not only answered when and where most of wars occurred, but also imply that relative food scarcity was a fundamental cause of war outbreaks according to our quantitative analysis on various physical and social components and in different geographical regions. Such a resource scarcity manifested itself in two causal pathways: a direct cause, in which resource-oriented wars erupted as most of the world's population still struggled to satisfy the lower levels of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-33"" id=""xref-ref-33-1"">33</A>), and an indirect cause, as constrained food resources and economic difficulties stemming from that intensified different social contradictions, that increased the likelihood of war outbreaks.</P><H3>Implications for the Future.</H3><P id=""p-31"">The findings from our study are germane to current situations even though they pertain to the consequences of <mark>climate</mark> cooling. We are now in the warmest climatic phase of the past two millennia, another climatic extreme like the 17th century in LIA, which was the coldest period of the past two millennia (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-17"" id=""xref-ref-17-5"">17</A>). Both higher and lower temperatures would lead to change of the human ecosystem. The important direct impact of the change from the <mark>climate</mark> cooling was on agricultural production that dominated the economy of agricultural societies. Global warming could also create an impact on agriculture. Although rising of temperature will, at least for a while, increase total bio-productivity according to biological principles, recent research suggests that the negative effects of global warming on agriculture seems greater than the positive effects (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-34"" id=""xref-ref-34-1"">34</A>, <A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-35"" id=""xref-ref-35-1"">35</A>). Significantly, most of the world's population will continue to rely on small-scale agriculture, which remains as vulnerable to climatic fluctuations as it was in the historical period covered in this study. Other direct impacts of global warming, such as sea level rising, spread of tropical diseases, increase of extreme weather events and glacial retreat, would also add costs on the current economy that is supported by cheap energy. In severe cases, the economic burden would cause conflict for resources and intensify social contradictions and unrest as we have seen in the past. However, we believe that the greater threat from global warming comes from the uncertainty of the ecosystem change, because the current high global average temperature (which has never been experienced in the last two millennia) is continuing to rise at an accelerated speed. Perhaps we are reaching the point at which it might break the balance of a human ecosystem that has been long established at a lower temperature, and in addition, many secondary and tertiary effects of global warming cannot be predicted based on current knowledge. A change of one key component in the ecosystem under global warming would likely cause disastrous results in human societies dependent on the existing human ecosystem. Is the changed ecosystem sufficiently adaptable or are the adaptation choices affordable for all of us?</P><P id=""p-32"">Although we have more robust social institutions at both international and national levels, and much more advanced social and technological developments at present, a much larger population size, higher standard of living, and more strictly controlled political boundaries will limit some adaptive choices to <mark>climate change</mark>. We hope that positive social mechanisms that are conducive to human adaptability will play an ever more effective role in meeting the challenges of the future.</P></DIV><DIV class=""section methods"" id=""sec-11""><H2>Methods</H2><H3>Paleo-<mark>Climate</mark> Data.</H3><P id=""p-33"">Research in the past 10 years has led to significant improvements in high-resolution paleo-<mark>climate</mark> reconstructions (see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1""><EM>SI Text</EM></A>). Our temperature data come from the most comprehensive and latest published records of the NH annual temperature trajectory, supplemented by the SH and global temperature trajectories (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-17"" id=""xref-ref-17-6"">17</A>). Besides, it has been confirmed that a cold period (LIA) existed globally during the last millennium (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-36"" id=""xref-ref-36-1"">36</A>, <A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-37"" id=""xref-ref-37-1"">37</A>) (see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1""><EM>SI Text</EM></A>).</P><H3>Historical Socioeconomic and Demographic Data.</H3><P id=""p-34"">Historical socioeconomic and demographic data for the early preindustrial era are scarce. It was not until the Late Middle Ages (≈A.D. 1400) that some of the desired records started to be kept. For war data, three of the most representative worldwide warfare series (<A class=""xref-fn"" href=""#fn-6"" id=""xref-fn-6-6"">‖</A>, <A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-38"" id=""xref-ref-38-2"">38</A>, <A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-39"" id=""xref-ref-39-2"">39</A>) were used to measure war frequency. Besides, a comprehensive China warfare dataset (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-40"" id=""xref-ref-40-2"">40</A>) that documents 1,664 armed-conflicts fought in A.D. 1000–1900 was also used in this research (see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1""><EM>SI Text</EM></A>). For population data, they were extracted from the <EM>Atlas of World Population History</EM> (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-24"" id=""xref-ref-24-6"">24</A>) and <EM>Recent History of Chinese Population</EM> (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-22"" id=""xref-ref-22-4"">22</A>) (see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1""><EM>SI Text</EM></A>). For food supply per capita, it is represented by historical cereal prices because it is determined by supply (agricultural production) and demand (population size). Nevertheless, only the cereal price data for Europe (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-41"" id=""xref-ref-41-2"">41</A>) and China (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-42"" id=""xref-ref-42-2"">42</A>) are long enough time series for our data analysis (see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1""><EM>SI Text</EM></A>). For agricultural production, it is a perceived wisdom that a cold <mark>climate</mark> would lead to harvest failure, especially in the past. Although the data on agricultural production for many parts of the world are unavailable in our study's time span, we could use two parameters to represent agricultural production in our quantitative analysis. The first one is the grain yield ratio in relation to seed for Western and Central Europe (<A class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-18"" id=""xref-ref-18-2"">18</A>), but the data are in 50-year intervals. The second one is the estimated annual values of agricultural production for Europe and China, which are calculated by population size over cereal price (see <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0703073104/DC1""><EM>SI Text</EM></A>).</P></DIV><DIV class=""section ack"" id=""ack-1""><H2>Acknowledgments</H2><P id=""p-39"">We thank Profs C.

Arctic ecosystems are undergoing rapid changes as a result of global <mark>climate change</mark>, with significant implications for the livelihoods of Arctic peoples. In this paper, based on ethnographic research conducted with the Iñupiaq communities of Noatak and Selawik in northwestern Alaska, we detail prominent environmental changes observed over the past twenty to thirty years and their impacts on subsistence-based lifestyles. However, we suggest that it is ultimately insufficient to try to understand how Arctic communities are experiencing and responding to <mark>climate change</mark> in isolation from other stressors. During interviews and participant observation documenting local observations of climatic and related environmental shifts and impacts to subsistence fishing practices, we find the inseparability of environmental, social, economic, cultural, and political realms for community residents. Many of our informants, who live in a mixed economy based on various forms of income and widespread subsistence harvesting of fish and game, perceive and experience <mark>climate change</mark> as embedded among numerous other factors affecting subsistence patterns and practices. Changing lifestyles, decreasing interest by younger generations in pursuing subsistence livelihoods, and economic challenges are greatly affecting contemporary subsistence patterns and practices in rural Alaska. Observations of <mark>climate change</mark> are perceived, experienced, and articulated to researchers through a broader lens of these linked lifestyle and cultural shifts. Therefore, we argue that to properly assess and understand the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on the subsistence practices in Arctic communities, we must also consider the total environment of change that is dramatically shaping the relationship between people, communities, and their surrounding environments.

Although the political dimensions of global <mark>climate change</mark> continue to produce debate, a scientific consensus has emerged that global temperatures are increasing with particularly dramatic changes occurring in Arctic ecosystems (ACIA 2005, Ford and Furgal 2009). Arctic average temperature has risen by 2-3°C, almost twice the rate of increase in lower latitudes over the past several decades (Corell 2006). The global phenomenon of <mark>climate change</mark> and the regional intensity of change in the Arctic are experienced at local scales. There is a recognition among Arctic residents that the regional <mark>climate</mark> has changed within living memory (Krupnik and Jolly 2002). Recently, more attention has been given to documenting local observations of <mark>climate change</mark> to provide a richer understanding of the complexities of ecosystem processes (Moller et al. 2004) and to understand the vulnerability of social-ecological systems to impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> (Ford et al. 2006). 
A growing number of studies have attempted to understand indigenous knowledge and perceptions of <mark>climate change</mark>, primarily in regions expected to experience the most pronounced changes (Riedlinger and Berkes 2001, Nichols et al. 2004, Hinzman et al. 2005, Berkes 2008). This flurry of research is in part due to a growing recognition within scientific disciplines that indigenous communities possess a deep and holistic understanding of complex systems based on long-term interactions with their surroundings (Berkes et al. 2000, Dowsley 2009). In addition to recent interest in indigenous knowledge of environmental change, many studies have sought to understand the vulnerability of indigenous communities to changing weather, travel, and hunting conditions (Hinzman et al. 2005, Ford et al. 2008, Ford 2009). Some argue that changing climatic conditions present formidable challenges to human health and food security, and “possibly even the survival of some cultures” (Corell 2006:151). The widespread circulation of this discourse of vulnerability has created a fertile context for research that focuses on the social, cultural, and economic impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> in the Arctic, the “bellwether for the global implications of <mark>climate change</mark>” (Corell 2006:149).
Although many researchers document the observations and experiences of indigenous communities as they relate to <mark>climate change</mark> (Krupnik and Jolly 2002), it becomes ever more apparent that there are numerous additional and perhaps more pressing changes facing Arctic communities (Fox 2002). Research suggests that the Arctic region, specifically indigenous communities, have historically faced, and continue to face dramatic political, social, cultural, and economic changes (Ford and Smit 2004, West and Hovelsrud 2010). Increasingly, scholars situate <mark>climate change</mark> amongst a myriad of social and natural transformations that influence how communities are affected by <mark>climate change</mark> (Turner et al. 2003, Tyler et al. 2007). The Arctic’s indigenous populations are not inexperienced in dealing with <mark>climate</mark>-generated stress (Cruikshank 2001, Burch 2006). In the recent past, social shifts have posed much more serious challenges to subsistence cultures. Within living memory, populations in the Arctic have become sedentary, traditional land-based activities have declined, industrialization and consumerism have been introduced, and ownership and management of much of the region’s land and natural resources have been usurped by outside bureaucratic bodies (Duerden 2004). 
In this paper, based on the unexpected results of our ethnographic research conducted in the Iñupiaq communities of Noatak and Selawik in northwestern Alaska, we suggest that it is ultimately insufficient to try to understand how Arctic communities are experiencing and responding to <mark>climate change</mark> in isolation from other stressors. During interviews and participant observation documenting local observations of climatic and related environmental shifts and impacts to subsistence fishing practices, we observed the inseparability of environmental, social, economic, cultural, and political realms for community residents. Many of our informants, who live in a mixed economy based on income from wage work, small businesses, corporate dividends, and/or transfer payments, and widespread subsistence harvesting of fish and game, perceive and experience <mark>climate change</mark> as embedded among numerous other factors affecting subsistence patterns and practices. Changing lifestyles, decreasing interest by younger generations in pursuing subsistence livelihoods, and economic challenges are dramatically reshaping subsistence patterns and practices in rural Alaska. As our research demonstrates, observations of <mark>climate change</mark> are perceived, experienced, and articulated to researchers through a broader lens of these linked lifestyle and cultural shifts. Therefore, we argue that to properly assess and understand the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on the subsistence practices in Arctic communities, we must also consider the “changing total environment” (C. Garcia-Quijano, J. Poggie, and A. Pitchon, <I>unpublished manuscript</I>) that is dramatically shaping the relationship between people, communities, and their surrounding environment. 
Several researchers have also recognized this key point and have presented integrated models for assessing change across social-ecological domains. Researchers in Barrow, Alaska, for example, demonstrate that the confluence of interacting human and natural factors together shape the vulnerability of the community to <mark>climate change</mark> (Lynch and Brunner 2007). Loring and Gerlach (2009) argue that an understanding of food security in rural Alaska requires an integrated assessment of linked socio-cultural, ecological, psychological, and biomedical aspects of individual and community health. These two examples explore the concepts of vulnerability and food security, notions that make central the linkages of the social to the ecological. In our case, however, we found a more fundamental inseparability of social-ecological domains. Even in our attempts to limit our discussion to observations of environmental change, informants consistently discussed wide-ranging shifts in ecological, social, cultural, political, and economic realms as they are experienced together. Our study that started as a study of climatic and related ecological shifts necessarily grew to explore the total environment of change that our informants detailed in their holistic responses. <H2 id=""methods5"">METHODS</H2>
This study draws upon ethnographic research conducted in 2010 and 2011 in the Iñupiaq communities of Noatak and Selawik, including semistructured interviews with 38 key informants and detailed participant observation. With assistance from community leaders, we selected a purposive sample of key informants based on age, long-term residency in the region, long-term participation in fishing activities, availability, and willingness to participate in the project. Our interviews were open-ended and semidirected to enable flexibility of responses (Huntington 1998). We directed informants to discuss environmental changes in the dominant seasons, i.e., open water season and ice season, their knowledge about the distribution and abundance of targeted subsistence fish, observations of species-level changes, and weather and seasonal patterns that affect traditional harvesting and processing techniques and schedules. Although unprompted, we encouraged our informants to discuss other challenges and topics of importance to their subsistence activities. We analyzed verbatim interview transcripts and field notes with inductive thematic coding in Atlas.ti (Bernard 2002). 
In addition to interviews, we used participant observation to provide more in-depth information about subsistence fishing activities in Noatak and Selawik and to establish and maintain relationships with active and experienced fishers in the communities (Jorgensen 1989, Bernard 2002). We traveled by boat with local families throughout the local river systems, stayed at fishing and hunting camps, harvested and processed fish and game alongside local experts, participated in the day-to-day activities in the communities, and attended social functions, such as church gatherings and community clean-ups. We visited the communities primarily during the summer months, the most active season for fishing, but also made trips to both communities during the fall and winter seasons. The duration of our community visits ranged between three days to three weeks. Our trips to fish camps ranged from single-day to week-long stays. Over the course of our study, we reported to tribal and local governments and held community meetings to share our findings, discuss future directions of the project, and gain feedback from community members about the accuracy of our results. <H2 id=""background8"">BACKGROUND</H2>
The contemporary community of Noatak is located about 120 km upstream from the mouth of the Noatak River and is about 90 km north of Kotzebue, the regional hub of the Northwest Arctic Borough. The population of Noatak is about 514 (U.S. Census Bureau 2010). The contemporary community of Selawik is located at the mouth of the Selawik River, about 112 km southeast of Kotzebue (Fig. 1). Selawik has a population of 829 people, making it the second largest community in the region (U.S. Census Bureau 2010). Over 90% of residents of both communities identify as Iñupiaq Eskimo. Before the 1900s, the Iñupiat of this region lived a primarily nomadic lifestyle, following a seasonal movement pattern that closely corresponded to the availability of food sources. People focused efforts on harvesting caribou (<I>Rangifer tarandus</I>), sea mammals, salmon, and other fish species (Burch 2006). The arrival of American whaling ships to the region instigated a wave of sustained social changes, including the establishment of missionary schools and health services in the 1890s (Chance 1990). The Friends Quaker Church erected federally supported schools along the Noatak and Selawik rivers in 1907 and 1908. As a result, the previously nomadic and dispersed Iñupiat built permanent homes near the schools, creating villages that still remain (Drucker 1996). 
Within the past 50 years, pronounced social, cultural, economic, and political changes have continued to shape contemporary ways of life in northwest Alaska villages. In the 1960s, snow machines replaced sled dog travel, dramatically decreasing local needs for fish and increasing reliance on fossil fuels (Hall 1971). In 1971, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act extinguished aboriginal claims to land and resources by transferring title and monetary compensation to newly established indigenous corporations, forever changing tribal resource rights and governance across the state (Case and Voluck 2002). The conditions of the communities continue to change rapidly, with increasing amounts of infrastructure developed each year. 
Such developments have had dramatic impacts on the lifestyle, culture, and subsistence practices of residents in Noatak and Selawik. Acculturation is closely associated with decreasing well-being and high levels of psychosocial stress among Alaska Natives (Wolsko et al. 2006, Wolsko et al. 2007). A nutritional transition is occurring in indigenous communities throughout the Arctic, with severe implications for physical, as well as psychosocial health (Kuhnlein et al. 2004). Local and traditional food is at the heart of culture and health, yet younger generations of Alaska Natives increasingly consume store-bought food (Bersamin et al. 2006). The high degree of government intervention and lacking economic opportunities in rural Alaska continue to undermine local self-determination and sustainability (Napoleon 1996). Throughout rural Alaska, these and other linked challenges persistently reshape local human-environment relations, community identity, and subsistence economies.
Despite the socioeconomic and cultural changes that have occurred over the past century in northwest Alaska, residents of Noatak and Selawik do continue to embrace a way of life orientated toward harvesting local resources. Residents of these communities on average harvest and consume approximately 165 kg of wild foods per person per year (Magdanz et al. 2010). These communities can be characterized as mixed economies, in which a pattern of subsistence production based on hunting, fishing, and gathering is supported by varying levels of engagement in wage labor and transfer payments and coexists within a market-based economy for goods and services (Wolfe and Ellanna 1983, Wolfe and Walker 1987, Buklis 1999). Transportation to and from Noatak and Selawik is limited to air and water. In addition to providing a nearly continuous supply of fish, the Noatak and Selawik rivers serve as vital transportation thoroughfares, connecting a network of communities. Local travel occurs by small boat, snow machine, and all-terrain vehicle. 
In Noatak, caribou, marine mammals, berries, and fish make up the majority of wild food harvests (Magdanz et al. 2010). Fish are often the most reliable subsistence resource in Noatak and Selawik. In Noatak, chum salmon (<I>Oncorhynchus keta</I>; Iñupiaq: aqalugruaq), Dolly Varden (<I>Salvelinus malma</I>; agalukpiq, locally called trout) and several species of whitefish (<I>Coregonus sp.</I>; qalupiaq) make up the majority of the catch. After ice break-up in the spring, many residents of Noatak travel to coastal camps to harvest bearded seal (<I>Erignathus barbatus</I>; ugruk), beluga (<I>Delphinapterus leucas</I>; sisuaq), and several species of whitefish. Residents return to Noatak by July, to begin setting gillnets for migrating chum salmon. Shortly before the river freezes, people begin seining for Dolly Varden and whitefish. During the winter, people opportunistically fish for Dolly Varden with rod and reel through the ice. In Selawik, local harvesters devote much of their effort to catching several species of whitefish, sheefish (<I>Stendous leucichthys</I>; sii), and northern pike (<I>Esox lucius</I>; siilik). Spring fishing in Selawik begins once the weather warms and the days lengthen. People use rod and reel to fish for sheefish in the larger lakes surrounding Selawik. After ice break-up occurs and water levels drop, families travel to their fish camps to set gillnets for whitefish and pike. After a couple of weeks, the water becomes too warm and fish spoil if left in the net for even a short period of time. During fall, the same fish are targeted in the same manner as in the spring. Selawik residents also participate in under ice fishing for whitefish with gillnets early in winter before the ice becomes prohibitively thick. During fall, Selawik and Noatak residents also hunt for moose (<I>Alces alces</I>) and caribou. Arctic grayling (<I>Thymallus arcticus</I>; suluqpaugaq), burbot (<I>Lota lota</I>; tiktaaliq), and several other species of fish are targeted to a lesser degree in both communities. Fishing and hunting practices in both communities are extremely flexible and dynamic as people respond to ever changing conditions and resource needs. <H2 id=""observations11"">OBSERVATIONS OF A TOTAL ENVIRONMENT OF CHANGE</H2>
The observations of Noatak and Selawik elders and active resource harvesters consistently provided tangible evidence of <mark>climate change</mark> during our interviews and observations. Based on our inductive coding of interview data, we observed four salient themes of <mark>climate change</mark> observations and impacts on subsistence practices: physical environmental change, changes in fish distribution and abundance, travel and access to resources, and unpredictable fish processing weather. The environmental changes observed over the past 20 to 30 years are described by informants as being without precedent and outside of the normal range of variation. The observations indicated increasing variability in weather conditions and increasingly unpredictable fish distributions, which have significant implications for subsistence activities. These phenomena are not unique to northwest Alaska. Communities in the Canadian Arctic and Alaska have been reporting similar environmental changes (Berkes and Jolly 2001, Riedlinger and Berkes 2001, Krupnik and Jolly 2002, Oozeva et al. 2004). A fifth theme also emerged from our data. The four environmental themes were discussed in the context of socioeconomic and cultural changes that have affected how subsistence livelihoods are pursued today. Following our informants’ framing of these social dimensions as inseparable from the environmental, we include them, drawing attention to the total environment of change occurring in Arctic Alaska (Table 1). <H3 id=""physical"">Physical environmental change</H3>
Informants from both communities consistently noted many changes in the physical environment related to changing climatic conditions, specifically changing river conditions. Informants perceived the nature and timing of river break-up to be different now than in the past. Several informants in Selawik noted that the ice now usually melts very quickly observing that the ice does not “break up anymore, it just melts in place.” Similarly, Noatak informants consistently noted that there are no longer any “big break-ups; the ice just melts out.” Several informants noted a trend of river break-up occurring earlier compared with past decades, although other informants noted that the timing of break-up has remained about the same. High water events associated with spring break-up are widely perceived to be less severe than in the past. Informants in both communities mention that the timing of freeze-up is less predictable. Most informants noted that freeze-up tends to occur later now than in the past and that a new freeze-thaw cycle now characterizes the freeze-up period. Thawing permafrost and increased erosion along the river edges are being observed in both communities. Informants related melting permafrost to sinking ground and the draining of lakes. The largest thaw slump documented in North America, measuring 220 m x 200 m x 25 m deep, occurred along the Selawik River in 2004 (Crosby 2009).<H3 id=""changes"">Changes in fish distribution and abundance</H3>
Informants linked the observed changes in the conditions of the waterways and weather with changing fish distribution and abundance. In Noatak, elders noted that Dolly Varden, the most important subsistence fish resource for the community, are less numerous and the size distribution has changed. Informants attributed this change to several factors including: increasing beaver activity, shallower river levels, warmer water temperatures in the summer that create unfavorable spawning conditions, and melting permafrost that leads to increased sedimentation in the spawning beds of the Dolly Varden, which decreases egg survival. In Selawik, informants noted that they are catching fewer broad and humpback whitefish (<I>Coregonus nasus</I> and <I>C. pidschian,</I> respectively) and more pike than in the past. Informants attributed the decline in whitefish to several factors. Some noted that pike feed on whitefish and increasing pike abundance may be related to a decline in whitefish abundance. Others related the decline in whitefish to beaver activity. Over the past couple of decades, beaver abundance has increased. Beaver dams block waterways, which limits the movement of whitefish between spawning, feeding, and overwintering grounds. <H3 id=""travel"">Travel and access to resources</H3>
Changing water levels, fish movement patterns, and weather conditions all create challenges for local harvesters to meet their subsistence needs. Residents from both communities noted that the river levels are lower on average during the open water season, partly because of changing precipitation patterns. This change affects transportation and access to important fishing locations. Boats commonly become stuck on the bottom or hit rocks while traveling, often causing prohibitively expensive damage to the lower units of engines. Families travel to fish camps during the spring and fall to pursue several species of whitefish, Dolly Varden, and pike as they undergo seasonal migrations. Residents now struggle to determine when to travel to their fish camps to catch the fish runs. Several experienced fishermen described how they missed the bulk of the fish moving by their camp in the recent past, arriving either too early or, more commonly, after the fish had already passed. Faster spring break-up limits the amount of time available for spring ice fishing, which provides a desirable source of fresh protein after the long winter.  Increasingly warmer weather during spring greatly impedes the harvest of quality fish, because of warmer water conditions. A Selawik resident described how warm water affects fishing: “The water’s too warm.  You’d like to stay at camp, like, another couple weeks, but the sun is too hot.  You have to pull out your net because the fish get too soft before you’re even done trying to scale them and cut them. They’re just no good.” Later and longer ice freeze-up affects access to resources and travel. Increasingly frequent freeze-thaw cycles in the fall make it difficult to decide when to store boats and rely solely on snow machines for travel.<H3 id=""unpredictable"">Unpredictable weather affects traditional fish processing</H3>
The Iñupiat of northwest Alaska have developed a complex body of knowledge regarding processing fish in the Arctic environment. Traditional drying and aging methods do not require the use of electric freezers, but instead make use of cool fall and spring weather. Increasingly less predictable weather hinders traditional fish processing methods. Residents of both communities recounted to us instances of being forced to throw drying fish away that had rotted in unexpected rainy weather. As one Selawik elder notes: <BLOCKQUOTE><I>Long time ago we don’t really take care of our fish. When we hang them, they dry even though we never really take care of them. Springtime, fall time, September. [Now] you have to watch them from sun. Too hot. Our rains, even those are different. They’re unpredictable. So we could count on it being dry when I was growing up in the springtime. And then the same thing in the fall time. Sometimes [now] it’d be so wet so much, people -- the fish can’t dry nowadays.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

As another informant noted, the recent occurrence of freeze-thaw cycles in the fall hinders the ability of people to produce “quaq,” an important traditional dish of fermented, frozen fish: <BLOCKQUOTE><I>I store away, like about, like two gunny sacks of quasriluk or broad fish whitefish, and it froze in October, and then it thawed, and then it rained, and then it freeze. My fish were too stink. My dogs didn’t even want to eat any of it and I didn’t want to eat it either. So I learned from that.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

Informants explain that they have shifted from drying and aging their fish outside in the traditional manner to relying on freezers for fish preservation.<H3 id=""socioeconomic"">Socioeconomic and cultural change</H3>
Within the context of interviews and participant observation based on exploring <mark>climate change</mark> and subsistence fisheries, we heard much about the broader context of change in subsistence livelihoods in this region. During interviews and participant observation, we learned that village residents do not perceive the environmental changes described above separately from other social changes in local fishing practices, but instead possess a holistic view of local conditions and the interacting drivers of change. We find this consistent with the literature on indigenous knowledge systems, in which knowledge, practice, and belief are inextricably linked and the dichotomization of the natural and the social worlds that often characterizes western thought is absent (Berkes 2008). In each of our interviews about environmental change, we found demonstration that residents of Noatak and Selawik recognize a unity of environmental and social spheres. The following interview excerpt from an interview in Noatak begins to reveal the inseparability of environmental-social change and the perception of village residents that <mark>climate change</mark> is simply one of many changes that have and are affecting the community. <BLOCKQUOTE>
Interviewer: <I>We’re trying to learn about environmental change, and if there’s any changes going on in Noatak with the weather, with how the seasons are happening, and how that may be affecting subsistence fishing.</I>
Informant: <I>Just the weather changed so the – I think the world is changing, that’s why. The weather’s changing. Getting hotter every year. No more snow. We all move down [to the lower 48] states. We used to have no snow machine them days. Just dog team. Every household used to have dog teams.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

Swift, unprompted transitions between environmental and social drivers of change, in this case from changing weather conditions to emigration trends to changing modes of transportation, happened with great frequency during interviews and casual conversations. We provide an overview of the salient socioeconomic and cultural changes that emerged during our ethnographic research. 
Many of our older informants discussed significant differences between contemporary living and the lifestyles of their youth. Over time, expensive modern technology has replaced traditional fishing and hunting techniques. For example, snow machines replaced sled dog teams as the predominant winter mode of transportation around 1975 (Magdanz et al. 2010). As a result, families no longer have to catch large numbers of fish to feed dog teams throughout the year and people can travel across the land much more quickly. One Noatak informant noted: <BLOCKQUOTE><I>When we were growing up ... we have to get what we get out of the land ... You don’t grow up like we do. You don’t have to feed your dogs. All you do is just park the snow machine or 4-wheeler outside the house. Before, you know, you have to cook for your dogs too, you know.  Day in, day out.  Busy all the time. You have to go out and get your wood before we start using oil stove.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

Today, the rural subsistence economy is heavily dependent on cash for the purchase and maintenance of equipment such as boat engines, snow machines, ice augers, and fishing nets. These shifts have increased the monetary requirements to pursue subsistence activities. 
Economic concerns dominated our discussions with informants about challenges to subsistence practices. All interviewees stated that they worry about the high cost of fuel and equipment. Many informants noted that the high cost of gasoline, which is double to triple the cost of gasoline available in urban areas in the state, prevents access to hunting and fishing places, and a lack of rural employment limits income opportunities. In response to the constraint of high gasoline prices, families pool their financial resources to travel to hunting and fishing camps together. In Selawik, informants explained that they have begun setting their nets near town rather than traveling to fish camp to conserve gasoline. The cost of equipment and maintenance was also mentioned frequently by informants in both communities as a barrier to subsistence activity. We found that many people interested in going fishing were unable because they could not afford parts needed to fix their boats.
In addition to the challenges associated with the high cost of subsistence activities, participation in the wage economy affects people’s ability to spend time hunting and fishing. Many families shape their activities at fish camp in the spring and fall around work schedules. One informant pointed out that nowadays there are “everyday fishermen” who do not hold a regular wage-earning job, and there are “Saturday fishermen,” who are only able to go fishing on their days off. It used to be that families traveled to important fishing and hunting locations for weeks to months at a time, but now people travel to distance locations on day trips or stay one night in camp. This is related to the advent of fast transportation equipment like snow machines and powerful outboards. Places that used to require more than a day’s travel can be reached in a few hours.
Changing social and economic conditions in Noatak and Selawik have made it difficult for the youth to develop the comparable hunting and fishing skill set as previous generations. Informants noted a general disconnect between the younger generation and subsistence practices, a trend characteristic of many northern subsistence-based cultures (Condon et al. 1995). Elders from both communities noted that access to a much greater number of conveniences such as cell phones, fast transportation, plumbing in the house, and store foods has resulted in a declining interest on the part of the youth to harvest local resources. Many felt that the contemporary youth have not learned how to work hard and perform activities that were basic necessities for the previous generation such as chopping wood, hauling water, and feeding dogs. People now eat more food available from local stores, which causes increased separation between local residents and their environment. The impact of store-bought foods was described by one Selawik informant in this way: “[there is] less fishing activity because there’s more access to different kinds of food; more heatables, microwaveables, and less interest in our Native food. Lot of children, new generation, I don’t think they like our style of food because they grew up with those microwaveables.” Additionally, the youth are increasingly pressured to seek training and employment outside of the rural village communities, which further limits the potential for them to develop the harvesting skills of their parents and grandparents.<H2 id=""discussion14"">DISCUSSION</H2>
Residents of Noatak and Selawik are aware of climatic changes and the impacts of these shifting environmental conditions on subsistence practices. Lower water levels hinder boating access to important fishing locations. Unpredictable weather conditions challenge traditional fish processing methods. Changing fish abundances and movement patterns undermines a body of knowledge about local ecological conditions that has developed over generations. These environmental changes are not observed alone, but are discussed in the context of accompanying social changes that have dramatically altered subsistence production and economies. The rate of social, economic, and political change in Arctic communities has had a profound influence upon the way in which communities and individuals interact with the environment (Condon et al. 1995). The increasing cost of participating in subsistence activities and dramatic changes in the social context of Arctic indigenous communities are causing a seeming decline in local fishing and hunting knowledge and level of participation in subsistence practices. Thus, these communities face a total environment of change, whereby environmental changes and broader socioeconomic challenges are jointly shifting and remaking human-environment relationships. Although there is prolific discussion on the potential threat of <mark>climate change</mark> on subsistence practices and community well-being, it is the dramatic social changes and economic challenges that are perceived by local residents to be the main long-term threat to subsistence activities. Understanding and anticipating the consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> requires knowledge about the interactions of <mark>climate change</mark> and other social and environmental stresses facing communities (Huntington et al. 2007, Forbes et al. 2009). 
Our findings are consistent with others who discuss the importance of considering the linkages between <mark>climate change</mark> and socioeconomic conditions (Turner et al. 2003, Tyler et al. 2007). Some have argued that social systems face “double exposure,” a term used to describe the concurrent impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> and forces of globalization (O’Brien and Leichenko 2000). Although our ethnographic data suggest that social and technological changes such as the mechanization of subsistence production have been more dramatic drivers of change in this case than shifting seasonal patterns, informants do not separate out environmental changes from other kinds of changes they have experienced over time. Environmental changes are perceived and experienced through subsistence practice. For example, we see the linkage of environmental, economic, and social factors in informants’ discussions of lower water levels in the Noatak River. Lower water levels force fishermen to burn more gas because “river shortcuts” are unavailable; traveling in shallow water presents risks for damaging boats and engines; low income levels and exorbitantly high costs of shipping to rural villages often prevents repair or replacement of broken parts, limiting future fishing access. Similarly, seasonal and fish movement shifts demonstrate the linked social-ecological subsistence system experienced in Noatak and Selawik. Less predictable weather and fish movement timing, combined with increasing participation in the wage economy has narrowed the windows of opportunity for fish harvesting and processing. 
In these examples, observations of <mark>climate change</mark> are not cognitively separated from economic and social changes, in terms of how they influence relationships between local communities and local environments. To properly assess and understand observations and impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on the subsistence practices in Arctic communities, we must necessarily consider the total environment of change that is dramatically shaping the relationship between people, communities, and their surrounding environment.
<H2 id=""conclusions17"">CONCLUSIONS</H2>
Given the increasing prevalence of <mark>climate change</mark> research and its predicted devastating impacts, we find it especially important to put <mark>climate change</mark> in context, as our informants have done, as one driver of change among a suite of stressors currently being experienced as a total environment of change in Arctic Alaska. Locally situated ethnographic research in Selawik and Noatak lends insight into the complex interactions between perceptible climatic changes and broad social, economic, cultural, and political changes and the combined impacts of these changes on subsistence economies in Arctic Alaska. Our ethnographic findings demonstrate that the dramatic socioeconomic and cultural transitions taking place in communities in northwest Alaska currently take precedence over <mark>climate change</mark> in terms of impacting the sustainability of subsistence practices and subsistence-based remote villages. However, we must also pay attention to the interaction of various impacts, such as the compounding nature of environmental and social change that dramatically affects the younger generations’ ability to continue subsistence livelihoods. As others have argued, we find that the coupled human-environment system is too complex to draw neat conclusions about the implications of <mark>climate change</mark> (Gearheard et al. 2006); much ambiguity remains. Within a science-based way of knowing, ethnographic approaches that engage local perceptions of change are necessary to generate meaningful understandings of total environments of change and to inform effective strategies of response. The increasing focus on, and support for, <mark>climate change</mark> research provides an opportunistic lens for deeper explorations of linked environmental-social change. In this research on <mark>climate change</mark>, we have found it most appropriate to turn our attention to the total environment of change affecting subsistence practices and culture in Arctic communities to gain a better sense of how global phenomena are driving change in place and context. <DIV id=""responses_block""><H2 id=""ms_responses"">RESPONSES TO THIS ARTICLE</H2>Responses to this article are invited.

Although more familiar <mark>climate</mark> news headlines have carried calls to “keep it in the ground” and divest investment portfolios from fossil fuels, a patient strategy has been quietly gaining momentum: shareholder engagement on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Shareholder engagement on issues of social and environmental justice is not new. <A href=""http://www.iccr.org/sites/default/files/40YearsOfICCREnviroStewardship.pdf"">Its history</A> as a movement spans over 40 years, started in the early 1970s by faith-based investors in the United States. It has been a successful strategy for enabling change both in the U.S. and internationally, exerting pressure on corporations over a range of social and environmental issues, from pushing companies to divest from South Africa during the apartheid regime and facing up to the harmful health effects of the tobacco industry to raising the standards for fashion companies in relation to safety and child labor. The movement is now being used as a tool to engage major oil and gas companies to acknowledge the imperative to act on <mark>climate change</mark> and to de-<mark>carbon</mark>ize their long-term business models.</P><P>Engagement takes many forms, including closed-door meetings, written correspondence and voting at company meetings. Where dialogue fails, the issue can be put to a vote by all shareholders under the shareholder resolution process. In the U.S., under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, shareholders owning at least 1 percent or $2,000 in shares of a company have the right to file a proposal in order to bring the issue to a shareholder vote at the company’s annual general meeting, raising awareness of both the issue at hand and the potential risk it poses to future earnings and shareholder returns.</P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> has become a recurring theme on the annual meeting agenda for many <mark>carbon</mark> intensive companies. According to the <A href=""http://www.proxypreview.org/"">Proxy Preview 2016</A> report produced by As You Sow, the <mark>Sustainable</mark> Investment Institute and Proxy Impact released in February, of the 370 shareholder resolutions filed in 2016 relating to environmental and social issues in the U.S., a record 94 were related to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Recurring themes of <mark>climate change</mark>-related shareholder resolutions request oil and gas companies to:</P><UL><LI>Acknowledge the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> to their business;</LI><LI>Adopt greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals;</LI><LI>Support the goal of limiting warming to less than 2°C;</LI><LI>Add a <mark>climate change</mark> expert adviser to the board;</LI><LI>Invest in low-<mark>carbon</mark> technologies and renewable energy;</LI><LI>Assess the long-term portfolio impacts of public <mark>climate change</mark> policies; and</LI><LI>Disclose funding of lobbyists and organizations dedicated to influencing <mark>climate policy</mark>.</LI></UL><P>How did <mark>climate change</mark>-related shareholder resolutions evolve from a handful of concerned nuns and friars to a record 94 resolutions filed in 2016? A <A href=""http://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/486412/Oil-and-Gas-Majors-Activities-with-Relation-to-<mark>Climate</mark>-Change/"">timeline</A> of resolutions compiled by the <A href=""http://ccsi.columbia.edu/"">Columbia Center on <mark>Sustainable</mark> Investment</A> tracks news reports and shareholder resolutions on <mark>climate change</mark> and renewable energy for four of the largest publicly owned oil and gas “super majors”:  Exxon, British Petroleum (BP), Dutch Shell and French <mark>Total SA</mark>.</P><P>The first <mark>climate change</mark>-related resolution in the timeline was filed with Exxon over two and a half decades ago in 1990, one year after the Exxon Valdez environmental disaster. The proposal requested Exxon’s board to “develop a company-wide plan to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions from the company’s energy production plants and facilities worldwide” and was met by Exxon’s management with opposition and dismissal. The proposal won a 6 percent share of votes, which was considered a small victory.</P><P>Many of the early <mark>climate change</mark> shareholder resolutions, such as greenhouse gas emissions reductions goals, have been filed year after year with the same company, keeping the issue persistently on the agenda and in the minds of the board and shareholders.</P><P>The <mark>climate change</mark> heat around Exxon in particular continues to rise. A Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation published in September 2015 by <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken"">Inside <mark>Climate</mark> News</A> exposed Exxon’s knowledge of the dangers of <mark>climate change</mark> since as early as 1977. New York, California and U.S. Virgin Islands attorneys general are currently <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/science/exxon-mobil-under-investigation-in-new-york-over-<mark>climate</mark>-statements.html"">investigating Exxon</A> for deliberately misleading its investors on the dangers of burning fossil fuels.</P><P>Meanwhile, Exxon continues to assert that its assets are not at risk of devaluation, sticking to its guns that overall demand for fossil fuels will remain high. “The fossil fuels of oil, coal and natural gas are expected to provide about 80 percent of global energy through 2040,” stated Exxon in its most recent <A href=""http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/energy/energy-outlook/global-fundamentals/fundamentals"">energy outlook</A>, noting that “oil will remain the world’s primary energy fuel.”</P><P>The regulators are not convinced. This month, <A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-investigating-exxon-on-valuing-of-assets-accounting-practices-1474393593"">the Securities and Exchange Commission announced</A> it is investigating how Exxon values its assets given the mounting global pressure to respond to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Nuns, friars, pension funds and other responsible investors have been persistent and patient, continuing their strategy of engagement for decades. Finally their efforts appear to be paying off.</P><P>The<A href=""http://investorson<mark>climate</mark>change.org/portfolio/aiming-for-a/""> “Aiming for A”</A> coalition based in the United Kingdom is a mix of faith-based and institutional investors, including the heavyweight £150 billion Local Authority Pension Fund Forum and the largest members of the £15 billion Church Investors Group. The coalition’s 2015 resolution, <EM>Strategic Resilience for 2035 and Beyond</EM>, filed with both British Petroleum and Shell, was a milestone for the shareholder engagement movement. The resolution requested the targeted companies to report annually on their <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, the resilience of their business model to low-<mark>carbon</mark> scenarios, investments in low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy technologies, and their public policy positions related to <mark>climate change</mark>, while aligning executive incentives to performance against low-<mark>carbon</mark> goals.</P><P>For the first time in the history of shareholder engagement on <mark>climate change</mark>, the management of both companies supported the resolution, recommending that their shareholders vote “Yes” in support of the proposal. It was approved in landslide victories, with 98.9 percent of voters at Shell and 98 percent of voters at BP supporting the resolution.</P><P>This sent a strong signal, not only to British Petroleum and Shell but to all companies in <mark>carbon</mark>-related industries, about the importance investors place on the risks posed by <mark>climate change</mark>, and on companies’ long-term responses. The “Aiming for A” coalition resolution was supported by a <A href=""http://www.lapfforum.org/Archive/files/AimingforAcofilergrid.pdf/view"">long list</A> of co-filers including churches, charities and pension funds from around the world. It was an example of international shareholder coalition building, a strategy that is building to encompass more countries, jurisdictions and shareholder voices.</P><P>And then there was Paris.</P><P><A href=""http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9444.php"">The Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement</A>, adopted at the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21) in December 2015, has now been signed by 197 countries and ratified by 75, accounting for over 58 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement will enter into force on Nov. 4, meaning countries that signed up are obliged to report on progress towards their emissions reduction goals and to submit tighter pledges every five years.</P><P>French oil and gas company Total’s CEO Patrick Pouyanne called the Paris agreement a “watershed,” noting that “there will be a ‘before’ and ‘after’ COP21.” Total was also one among 10 major oil and gas companies pushing for a global price on <mark>carbon</mark>, joining the<A href=""http://www.oilandgas<mark>climate</mark>initiative.com/news/oil-and-gas-ceos-jointly-declare-action-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change""> Paris Pledge for Action</A>. In this declaration, the CEOs of the 10 companies that make up the Oil &amp; Gas <mark>Climate</mark> Initiative declared their strategic alignment with a low-<mark>carbon</mark> future: “Our shared ambition is for a 2°C future. It is a challenge for the whole of society. We are committed to playing our part.” Total also joined 38 French companies in the <A href=""http://www.total.com/sites/default/files/atoms/files/french_business_<mark>climate</mark>_pledge_en.pdf"">“French Business <mark>Climate</mark> Pledge”</A> on Nov. 26, 2015, aiming to commit 45 billion euros over five years toward renewable energy technologies.</P><P>“If nothing else, analysts and experts say, the accord is a signal to businesses and investors that the era of <mark>carbon</mark> reduction has arrived,” The New York Times <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/14/business/<mark>climate</mark>-accord-draws-mixed-reaction-from-business-leaders.html?_r=0"">reported</A>. “It will spur banks and investment funds to shift their loan and stock portfolios from coal and oil to the growing industries of renewable energy, like wind and solar.”</P><P>The Paris agreement momentum continued into 2016.</P><P>The 2016 proxy season saw the most <mark>climate change</mark> related resolutions filed in the history of the movement, 94 compared with 82 in 2015. In addition to the oil and gas sector, mining companies with coal assets and major users of fossil fuels such as utility companies came under increased <mark>climate change</mark> shareholder pressure in 2016. In the mining sector, the boards of <A href=""http://h"">Anglo American,</A><A href=""http://h"">Glencore</A> and <A href=""http://h"">Rio Tinto</A> supported “<EM>Strategic Resilience</EM>” resolutions filed by the “Aiming for A” coalition, with resounding votes in support—96 percent, 98 percent and 99 percent respectively.</P><P>In the utilities sector, <mark>carbon</mark> asset risk resolutions were filed at <A href=""http://h"">Great Plains Energy</A>, <A href=""https://www.ceres.org/investor-network/resolutions/aep-report-on-stranded-assets-due-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">American Electric Power</A>, <A href=""http://www.asyousow.org/companies/first-energy/"">FirstEnergy</A> and <A href=""https://www.ceres.org/investor-network/resolutions/southern-company-report-on-risk-of-stranded-coal-related-assets-2016"">Southern Company</A>, shining a light in their boardrooms on the growing risk of stranded coal assets. Unlike the slow progress of oil and gas shareholder engagement, the Great Plains and American Electric Power resolutions were withdrawn in exchange for agreements and action by the utilities. FirstEnergy and Southern Company resolutions received strong levels of shareholder support, 31 percent and 29 percent respectively, a clear call for these companies to diversify away from coal.</P><P>Has shareholder engagement as a strategy to force major oil and gas companies to take <mark>climate</mark> action finally been successful? Can we learn from the timeline of past resolutions the types of strategies and issues in successful shareholder resolutions in order to guide engagement moving forward, to achieve a rapid transition to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy? Can shareholders also engage with other energy-consuming sectors (such as the power utilities, refineries and car-making industry), in support of the goals of the Paris Agreement?</P><P>These and other questions will be up for discussion in November at the Columbia Center on <mark>Sustainable</mark> Investment’s international investment <A href=""http://ccsi.columbia.edu/2016/11/02/11th-annual-columbia-international-investment-conference-<mark>climate</mark>-change-and-<mark>sustainable</mark>-investment-in-natural-resources-from-consensus-to-action/"">conference</A>.</P><P><EM>Wendy Hapgood is a research assistant at the Columbia Center on <mark>Sustainable</mark> Investment. </EM></P><P><SPAN style=""border-radius: 2px; text-indent: 20px; width: auto; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px; text-align: center; font: bold 11px/20px 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ffffff; background: #bd081c no-repeat scroll 3px 50% / 14px 14px; position: absolute; opacity: 1; z-index: 8675309; display: none; cursor: pointer; top: 268px; left: 20px;"">Save</SPAN></P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

			Documentation</SMALL></A></LI></UL><DIV id=""tab-1""><H3>Key Points</H3><UL class=""roomy""><LI>Total snowfall has decreased in many parts of the country since widespread observations became available in 1930, with 57 percent of stations showing a decline (see Figure 1). Among all of the stations shown, the average change is a decrease of 0.19 percent per year.</LI><LI>In addition to changing the overall rate of precipitation, <mark>climate change</mark> can lead to changes in the type of precipitation. One reason for the decline in total snowfall is because more winter precipitation is falling in the form of rain instead of snow. Nearly 80 percent of the stations across the contiguous 48 states have experienced a decrease in the proportion of precipitation falling as snow (see Figure 2).</LI><LI>Snowfall trends vary by region. The Pacific Northwest has seen a decline in both total snowfall and the proportion of precipitation falling as snow. Parts of the Midwest have also experienced a decrease, particularly in terms of the snow-to-precipitation ratio. A few regions have seen modest increases, including some areas near the Great Lakes that now receive more snow than in the past (see Figures 1 and 2).</LI></UL></DIV><DIV id=""tab-2""><H3>Background</H3><P>Snowfall is an important aspect of winter in much of the United States. Many people depend on snow to provide water when it melts in the spring—including 60 million people in the western United States<A href=""#ref1""><SUP>1</SUP></A>—and many communities rely on snow for winter recreation. Some plants and animals also depend on snow and snowmelt for survival. The amount of snow that falls in a particular area directly influences both snow cover and snowpack, which refer to snow that accumulates on the ground (see the <A href=""/<mark>climate</mark>-indicators/<mark>climate</mark>-change-indicators-snow-cover"">Snow Cover</A> indicator and the <A href=""/<mark>climate</mark>-indicators/<mark>climate</mark>-change-indicators-snowpack"">Snowpack</A> indicator).</P><P>Warmer temperatures cause more water to evaporate from the land and oceans, which leads to more precipitation, larger storms, and more variation in precipitation in some areas. In general, a warmer <mark>climate</mark> causes more of this precipitation to fall in the form of rain instead of snow. Some places, however, could see more snowfall if temperatures rise but still remain below the freezing point, or if storm tracks change. Areas near large lakes might also experience more snowfall as lakes remain unfrozen for longer periods, allowing more water to evaporate. In contrast, other areas might experience less snowfall as a result of wintertime droughts.</P><P>Changes in the amount and timing of snowfall could affect the spawning of fish in the spring and the amount of water available for people to use in the spring and summer. Changes in snowfall could also affect winter recreation activities, like skiing, and the communities that rely on these activities.</P></DIV><DIV id=""tab-3""><H3>About the Indicator</H3><P>This indicator tracks total snowfall as well as the percentage of precipitation that falls in the form of snow versus rain. These data were collected from hundreds of weather stations across the contiguous 48 states.</P><P>Total snowfall is determined by the height of snow that accumulates each day. These measured values commonly appear in weather reports (for example, a storm that deposits 10 inches of snow). Figure 1 shows how snowfall accumulation totals changed between 1930 and 2007 at more than 400 weather stations. These stations were selected because they had high-quality data for this entire time period.</P><P>Figure 2 shows trends in the proportion of total precipitation that falls in the form of snow during each winter season. This is called the “snow-to-precipitation” ratio, and it is based on comparing the amount of snowfall with the total amount of precipitation (snow plus rain) in each year. For this comparison, snow has been converted to the equivalent amount of liquid water. These data are available from 1949 to 2016.</P></DIV><DIV id=""tab-4""><H3>Indicator Notes</H3><P>Several factors make it difficult to measure snowfall precisely. The snow accumulations shown in Figure 1 are based on the use of measuring rods. This measurement method is subject to human error, as well as the effects of wind (drifting snow) and the surrounding environment (such as tall trees). Similarly, snow gauges for Figure 2 may catch less snow than rain because of the effects of wind. Steps have been taken, however, to limit this indicator to weather stations with the most consistent methods and the highest-quality data.<A href=""#ref4""><SUP>4</SUP></A> As a result, some parts of the country have a higher station density than others.</P><P>Both figures are limited to the winter season. Figure 1 comes from an analysis of October-to-May snowfall, while Figure 2 covers November through March. Although these months account for the vast majority of snowfall in most locations, this indicator might not represent the entire snow season in some areas. Most of the data shown for mountainous regions come from lower elevations (towns in valleys) because that is where weather stations tend to be located.</P></DIV><DIV id=""tab-5""><H3>Data Sources</H3><P>This indicator shows trends based on two sets of weather records collected and maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Figure 1 was adapted from an analysis by Kunkel et al. (2009)<SUP><A href=""#ref5"">5</A> </SUP>based on records from Cooperative Observer Program weather stations.

Total will focus on portfolio overhaul, technological <mark>innovation</mark>, and policy advocacy, as its three-pronged approach to helping the world keep cumulative emissions under 1000 gigatons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide equivalent from 2013 to 2050.</P><P>One of the company’s top priorities is to exit the coal business. Total already ceased its coal production, in August 2015, after selling its affiliate Total Coal South America, and plans to withdraw from coal marketing by the end of 2016. At the same time, the company will turn its focus towards increasing the proportion of natural gas in the mix, which already accounts for roughly half of its reserves and production. Total also confirms in this report that it does not conduct oil exploration or production in the Arctic ice pack, and that it has recently decreased its exposure to Canadian oil sands, as well.</P><P>Total also intends to increase the share of renewable energy in its portfolio to 20% in twenty years. To that end, the company intends to complete a biofuel refinery in France next year, increase its investments in solar energy and energy storage technologies, and develop a renewable power trading business.  Total is pledging 25% of its $7.4 billion R&amp;D budget towards clean tech and environmental issues between 2015 and 2019, and is also investing $150 million in 25 innovative energy start-up companies.</P><P>Under the strategy, Total will continue to be a major producer of oil and gas. But it recognizes that its ability to produce these fuels while remaining within the 2°C scenario will depend on the viability of <mark>carbon</mark> capture, use and storage technologies. The company thus intends to allocate up to 10% of its R&amp;D budget towards decreasing the costs of such techniques.</P><P>Finally, Total is strongly advocating for a globalized <mark>carbon</mark> pricing mechanism that links the main economic regions together, a policy that CEO Patrick Pouyanné declares is the “most efficient financial mechanism to change the rules of the game quickly”. Total uses an internal <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide price of $30 to $40 per ton when assessing its investments, and believes such a price tag would force a complete switch from coal to natural gas.</P><P>The strategy put forth by Total is commendable, displaying convincing corporate responsibility and a public commitment to concrete goals and timeline. It remains to be seen whether the company sticks to its plan, and if this can become a guiding framework for other companies to follow in the future.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The Sisters of St Dominic of Caldwell, New Jersey will invoke his encyclical about <mark>climate change</mark> in their proposal to commit ExxonMobil to support the Paris goal of limiting global warming to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels.</P><P>ExxonMobil, the world’s largest private oil company, gives these resolutions short shrift. It argues that more energy is necessary to alleviate global poverty, and that technology—coupled with a <mark>carbon</mark> tax—will mitigate the environmental risks. It may hope that a recent rebound in oil prices to around $50 a barrel will pacify shareholders. But their frustrations have been fanned by a decade of wasteful spending in the oil and gas industry (see chart). Some believe that more restrained capital allocation would boost returns, as well as helping the planet.</P><P>Most, if not all, of the investors’ resolutions will fail, says Heidi Welsh of the <mark>Sustainable</mark> Investments Institute, an American research firm. Such is the relatively docile nature of owner activism in America. But she says pressure from investors, ranging from those with concerns about the long-term economic impact of <mark>climate change</mark> to those with more moral preoccupations, is “coming to a head”.</P><P>This month, an unexpectedly high 49% of shareholders backed a resolution urging Occidental Petroleum, another American oil firm, to stress-test a two-degree scenario. Some 42% voted for <mark>climate</mark>-related resolutions at Anadarko, a rival, and AES, a utility. Robert McCormick of Glass Lewis, a proxy advisory firm, says such a large vote suggests that usually placid asset managers, such as mutual funds, may have joined the green revolt alongside pension funds—more established rebels. He notes that the resolutions, even if passed, would be non-binding. But if they are ignored, shareholders can express their frustration in subsequent years by refusing to support a company’s board nominees, he says.</P><P>The pressure on the American supermajors follows the “Aiming for A” campaign by institutional investors in Britain that last year forced Royal Dutch Shell and BP, the biggest European oil firms, to agree to reveal how stringent <mark>climate</mark>-change policies would affect their investment portfolios. Change across the Atlantic has proved harder to effect. Anne Simpson of CalPERS says shareholders have weaker rights in America, which has a more litigious corporate culture and where it is harder to challenge boards than in Britain. She talks of a “shut up or sell up” mentality.</P><P>Hence CalPERS is seeking “proxy access” at ExxonMobil that would give large shareholders the right to nominate board members. This is a growing trend in corporate America (a majority supported proxy access at Chevron last year), and Ms Simpson says it is aimed at installing a “<mark>climate</mark>-competent” board at ExxonMobil. The firm continues to reject it, even though last year the proposal gathered 49.4% of shareholder support. “If we can’t hold boards accountable we may as well sit and whistle,” she says, adding: “If we don’t win this year, we will be back next year.”</P><P>Yet even when firms agree to such resolutions, there is no guarantee their level of disclosure will satisfy investors. On May 11th Shell issued two reports on its assessment of <mark>climate</mark>-change risks in response to last year’s vote. Full of pretty pictures and snazzy charts, they revealed little about how <mark>climate</mark> policies would alter future plans for developing oil- and gasfields.</P><P>James Leaton of the <mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker Initiative, an investment-focused NGO, says that in one report Shell tried to downplay the role of private oil companies in generating greenhouse gases, seeking to shift the blame instead to national state-controlled firms with larger reserves. “We don’t need 50 pages of glossy documents,” he says. “Give us two pages and tell us what high-cost projects you would cancel.”</P><P>On the same day as the reports were published, Shell informed its employees that it was creating a “New Energies” business to invest in green technologies. But it and BP insist that hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s will still account for at least 75% of the world’s energy for decades to come. Their response to global warming is to promote natural gas over coal and, eventually, oil; renewable energy remains a tiny share of their investment budgets. “Rumours of the death of oil are a little premature,” says Peter Mather, head of BP’s British business.</P><P>The only supermajor that wins high marks from shareholders for what they say is a more committed response to <mark>climate change</mark> is <mark>Total SA</mark>, a French company, which like Shell hosts its AGM on May 24th. It plans to set out its ambition to develop an energy mix by 2035 consistent with Paris-style global-warming limits, including a pledge to invest $500m a year in renewables, and a “symbolic objective” to raise their share to 20% of its portfolio, from 3%. In an effort to complement its acquisition of SunPower, an American solar-energy company, in 2011, it launched an offer this month to acquire Saft, a French battery-maker, which will bolster its expertise in electricity storage.</P><P>But Total is likely to remain an oil and gas company above all else. Alongside its renewables aspirations, it claims that one of its most exciting ventures is producing natural gas in the pristine Russian Arctic. It does not see this as a contradiction. In fact, it argues that the focus on natural gas actually reflects its commitment to a two-degree global-warming scenario. From under their habits, French nuns may murmur growing disapproval in response.  </P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

For decades, scientists have carefully accumulated data that confirms what we hoped wasn’t true: The greenhouse gas emissions that have steadily spewed from cars and planes and factories, the technologies that powered a massive period of economic growth, came at an enormous cost to the planet’s health. Today, we know that absent any change in our behavior, the average global temperature will rise as much as 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Global sea levels will rise by up to 6 feet. Along with those shifts will come radical changes in weather patterns around the globe, leaving coastal communities and equatorial regions forever changed—and potentially uninhabitable.</P><P>Strike that. We are already seeing the effects of a dramatically changed <mark>climate</mark>, from extended wildfire seasons to worsening storm surges. Now, true, any individual weather anomaly is unlikely to be solely the result of industrial emissions, and maybe your particular part of the world has been spared so far. But that’s little solace when the historical trends are so terrifyingly real. (Oh, and while it used to take mathematicians months to calculate how the odds of specific extreme weather events were affected by humans, they’ve knocked that data-crunching time down to weeks.)</P><P class=""paywall"">Thankfully, it seems most of the world’s nation-states are beyond quibbling over the <EM>if</EM> of <mark>climate change</mark>—they’re moving rapidly onto the <EM>what now</EM>? The 2015 Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement marked a turning point in the conversation about planetary pragmatics. Renewable energy in the form of wind and solar is actually becoming competitive with fossil fuels. And the world’s biggest cities are driving <mark>sustainable</mark> policy choices in a way that rival the contributions of some countries. Scientists and policymakers are also beginning to explore a whole range of last-ditch efforts—we’re talking some serious sci-fi stuff here—to deliberately, directly manipulate the environment. To keep the <mark>climate</mark> livable, we may need to prepare for a <A href=""https://www.wired.com/story/lets-talk-geoengineering/"">new era of geoengineering</A>.</P><H3 class=""paywall"">How this Global <mark>Climate</mark> Shift Got Started</H3><P class=""paywall"">If we want to go all the way back to the beginning, we could take you to the Industrial Revolution—the point after which <mark>climate</mark> scientists start to see a global shift in temperature and atmospheric <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels. In the late 1700s, as coal-fired factories started churning out steel and textiles, the United States and other developed nations began pumping out its byproducts. Coal is a <mark>carbon</mark>-rich fuel, so when it combusts with oxygen, it produces heat along with another byproduct: <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. Other <mark>carbon</mark>-based fuels, like natural gas, do the same in different proportions.</P><P class=""paywall"">When those emissions entered the atmosphere, they acted like an insulating blanket, preventing the sun’s heat from escaping into space. Over the course of history, atmospheric <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels have varied—a lot. Models of ancient <mark>climate</mark> activity, hundreds of millions of years back, put <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels as high as several thousand parts per million. In the past half-million years or so, they’ve fluctuated between about 180 and 300 parts per million. But they haven't fluctuated this fast. Today, atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> is at 407 ppm—roughly one and half times as high as it was just two centuries ago. And we know for certain that extra greenhouse gas is from humans; analysis of the <mark>carbon</mark> isotopes in the atmosphere show that the majority of the extra CO<SUB>2</SUB> comes from fossil fuels.</P><DIV class=""js-skip-wide-content large-component paywall large-component--image""><FIGURE class=""image-embed-component""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption-component""><DIV class=""caption-component__caption""><P>Radiation from the sun hits the Earth’s atmosphere. Some of it travels down to warm the Earth's surface (A), while some of it bounces right back into space (B). Some of the energy, though, is absorbed by molecules of greenhouse gases—<mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, water, methane, and nitrous oxide—that prevent it from escaping (C). Over time, the trapped energy contributes to global warming.</P></DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><P class=""paywall"">The result: extreme weather. There’s global warming, of course; the Earth’s average temperature has increased 1.1 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century. But it goes further. As oceans absorb heat and polar ice sheets melt, hurricane seasons become more severe as warm water from the oceans kicks warm, moist air into the atmosphere. Sea levels rise—about 8 inches in the past century. Critically, the rate of these changes is increasing.</P><DIV class=""inset-left-component paywall""><H4 name=""inset-left"" class=""inset-left-component__el"">By the Numbers</H4><H3 name=""inset-left"" class=""inset-left-component__el"">1.9 million</H3><P name=""inset-left"" class=""inset-left-component__el"">The number of homes in the US that could end up underwater if sea levels rise 6 feet by 2100, as models suggest.

During that same period, the front of the glacier retreated 7 miles.</P></DIV><P class=""paywall"">All of this has led 97 percent of <mark>climate</mark> scientists to agree that warming trends are very likely the result of human activity. And in 1988, that bulk of research led to the founding of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, which has now issued five assessment reports documenting all the available scientific, technical, and economic information on <mark>climate change</mark>. The fourth report, in 2007, was the first to clearly state that the <mark>climate</mark> was unequivocally warming—and that human-created greenhouse gases were very likely to blame.</P><P class=""paywall"">Just because the panel came to a consensus doesn’t mean everyone else did, though. In 2009, <mark>climate</mark> scientists had their own WikiLeaks scandal, when <mark>climate</mark> deniers released a trove of emails from scientists, including the one behind the famous 1999 “hockey stick” graph showing a sharp upturn in global temperature after the Industrial Revolution—one that was clearly sharper than the many global warmings and coolings the Earth has seen. Excerpts taken out of context from those emails showed that researcher, Michael Mann, purportedly conspiring to statistically manipulate his data. Placed back in context, they clearly didn’t.</P><P class=""paywall"">Political controversy has continued to call into question scientists’ consensus on data supporting the concept of human-caused <mark>climate change</mark>, motivated by the financial incentives of the fossil fuel industry. But in 2015, the world’s leaders appeared to transcend those squabbles. On December 12, after two weeks of deliberations at the 21st United Nations Conference on <mark>Climate Change</mark> in Le Bourget, France, 195 countries agreed on the language in what’s known as the Paris agreement. The goal is to keep average global temperature increase to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-Industrial levels, and as close to 1.5 degrees as possible. It does so by having each country submit a commitment to reduce emissions and collectively bear the economic burden of a shift from fossil fuels—while acknowledging that developing nations would be denied a certain amount of growth if they had to give up cheap energy.</P><P class=""paywall"">On November 4, 2016, the Paris agreement officially entered into force, just four days before Donald Trump would be elected president of the United States on a campaign promise to pull out of the agreement. And on June 1, 2017, Trump made good on that promise, saying that “the United States will withdraw from the Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord, but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.” Technically, the United States remains in the agreement until 2020, which is the earliest Trump can officially withdraw.</P><H3 class=""paywall"">What's Next for <mark>Climate Change</mark></H3><P class=""paywall"">The good news is, the global community is pretty united on the risks of <mark>climate change</mark>. The science is getting good enough to link specific extreme events—anomalous hurricanes, extreme flooding events—directly to human-caused <mark>climate change</mark>, and that’s making it easier to build a case for dramatic action to stem the damage. But what should those actions be?</P><P class=""paywall"">The most obvious solution to <mark>climate change</mark> woes is a dramatic shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energies: solar, wind, geothermal, and (deep breath) nuclear. And we’re making solid progress, growing our renewable electricity generation about 2.8 percent every year worldwide.</P><P class=""paywall"">But there’s an increasing understanding that even if every country that originally signed up for the agreement meets every single one of their stated goals, the Earth is still set to experience some dramatic changes. Some even argue that we’ve passed the tipping point; even if we stopped emitting today, we’d still see dramatic effects. And that means we need to start preparing for a different kind of <mark>climate</mark> future—primarily, in the way we build. The floods will come, forcing us to make new rules governing building. An ever-lengthening wildfire season will discourage building along the wildland-urban interface. And people will stream in from regions made uninhabitable by drought or heat or flooding, forcing other countries to adapt their immigration policies to a new class of refugees.</P><P class=""paywall"">All of those changes will cost money. That was one of the primary motivators for the Paris agreement: Switching away from cheap fossil fuels means that businesses and companies are going to need to take a financial hit to ensure a profitable, livable future. Which is why many of the solutions to <mark>climate change</mark> have nothing to do with <mark>climate</mark> science, per se: They have to do with economics.</P><DIV class=""inset-left-component paywall""><H4 name=""inset-left"" class=""inset-left-component__el"">By the Numbers</H4><H3 name=""inset-left"" class=""inset-left-component__el"">407.6 parts per million</H3><P name=""inset-left"" class=""inset-left-component__el"">The concentration of CO<SUB>2</SUB> in the lowest layer of our planet’s atmosphere.

Warming seas are a particular problem for coral, which release the photosynthetic algae they use to extract energy from sunlight when they’re stressed and bleach to death.</P></DIV><P class=""paywall"">Socially conscious investors, for their part, are making a difference by holding businesses to account for their impacts on the <mark>climate</mark>—and the ways in which <mark>climate change</mark> will impact their business. Last year, a collective of small-scale pension systems forced Occidental Petroleum, one of the country’s largest oil companies, to disclose <mark>climate</mark> risk in its shareholder prospectus; ExxonMobil caved to pressure in December 2017. Places with large endowments, like universities, are facing political pressure to divest from the fossil fuel industry.</P><P class=""paywall"">These are all indirect ways of holding the fossil fuel industry accountable for the financial toll it takes on the Earth with every gigaton of greenhouse gases emitted. But there are more direct ways they can pay up, too. After reporting by <EM>Inside-<mark>Climate</mark> News</EM> revealed in 2015 that ExxonMobil has long known about the risks of <mark>climate change</mark>, the company is being investigated by attorneys general in multiple states to determine if it violated consumer or investor protection statutes. The city of San Francisco is suing the five largest publicly-held producers of fossil fuels to get them to pay for infrastructure to protect against rising sea levels. New York City followed with a similar suit.</P><P class=""paywall"">Let’s say those suits succeed, and at-risk cities get some help making the massive infrastructure updates necessary to protect their coastline investments. After doing everything we can to reduce further <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and protect life and property from the dangers of a changing <mark>climate</mark>, it still won’t be enough to keep global temperatures from rising beyond that 2-degree-Celsius tipping point. So that’s when humanity goes into proactive mode, potentially unleashing a controversial set of experimental technologies into the atmosphere. This is geoengineering: Removing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and reducing heat through, let’s say, <EM>experimental</EM> means. Like salt-spraying ships, and supersized space mirrors.</P><P class=""paywall"">One of the great hopes of the IPCC’s latest report is that we can pull <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide directly out of the atmosphere and store it underground through a process called bioenergy with <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage. But that technology doesn’t exist yet. Another strategy attempts to reduce heat by injecting sulfate particles into the atmosphere, reflecting solar radiation back into space—but that could trigger too much global cooling. Put mildly, most of the propositions for geoengineering are underdeveloped. The drive to complete those ideas will depend on the success of global cutbacks in the decades to come.</P><H3 class=""paywall"">Learn More</H3><UL class=""paywall""><LI><STRONG><A href=""https://www.wired.com/story/the-dirty-secret-of-the-worlds-plan-to-avert-<mark>climate</mark>-disaster/?mbid=GuidesLearnMore"">The Dirty Secret of the World’s Plan to Avert <mark>Climate</mark> Disaster</A></STRONG></LI></UL><P class=""paywall"">When the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> issued its fifth assessment report in 2014, it laid out 116 scenarios for keeping average global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius.

Radical and immediate action is required to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. One technology which is essential to limit the atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration is the storage of CO<SUB>2</SUB> into geological reservoirs. This relatively short term solution has to be used in parallel with renewable energies, energy efficiency improvement and energy mix optimisation.</P><P>For CO<SUB>2</SUB> storage to become an efficient tool to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, large volumes of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, compressed to a supercritical state, should be injected into large, deep saline aquifers or deep, depleted hydro<mark>carbon</mark> reservoirs.</P><P>Most of the available storage capacities are currently located in saline aquifers, but these formations are generally not well characterised and are not evenly distributed on the planet. On the contrary, depleted oil and gas fields are usually well-characterised formations because of the history of gas field production.</P><H3>TOTAL’s CCUS ambition</H3><P><A href=""https://www.total.com/en/energy-expertise"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TOTAL</A>’s ambition is to become a leader in CO<SUB>2</SUB> capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technology by 2035, using a two-pronged strategy to participate in <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation and prepare for new business opportunities. To achieve this goal, TOTAL will position itself as an integrator of the full CCUS value chain, developing internal competencies, working in partnership and boosting innovative technologies and the development of start-ups.</P><P>The main strategic priorities of the TOTAL’s CCUS roadmap related to storage topics are: to operate and manage a CO<SUB>2</SUB> storage project at an industrial scale and at the same time exploit TOTAL’s existing expertise to solve key remaining storage issues.</P><P>TOTAL’s subsurface experience and expertise can contribute to fostering the deployment of CO<SUB>2</SUB> storage worldwide and therefore contribute to the positioning of the group as a world-class leader in CCUS. This objective can be reached by decreasing the uncertainties around CO<SUB>2</SUB> storage capacities, to promote CCUS globally, and by preparing for the safe and cost-effective operation of industrial-scale CO<SUB>2</SUB> storage projects.</P><H3>TOTAL, a CCS experience since the 2000s</H3><P>TOTAL has long been committed to developing CCUS technology as a means to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, and has acquired industrial CCS expertise thanks to shares taken in Snøhvit and Sleipner in the North Sea – projects in which CO<SUB>2</SUB> was captured from gas treatment – and through the Lacq French CO<SUB>2</SUB> injection pilot project (Fig. 1), carried out between 2010 and 2013. This integrated pilot, operated by TOTAL, involved gas oxy-fuel combustion capture, followed by storage in a gas-depleted reservoir. 51,000 metric tons of CO<SUB>2</SUB> were injected until 2013 and we continued to monitor the reservoir until 2017.</P><H3>R&amp;D challenges</H3><P>The subject of geological CO<SUB>2</SUB> storage has its own scientific challenges, which are manifold. In particular, the safety and acceptability of storage projects are key issues. We will have to make sure we are injecting CO<SUB>2</SUB> safely during the injection period, but also that there will be no risks for future generations.</P><P>TOTAL’s approach, in the continuity of its <mark>climate</mark> strategy, is to move toward gigaton-scale CO<SUB>2</SUB> storage projects, rather than the megaton-scale CO<SUB>2</SUB> storage projects underway today. Consequently, we target large CO<SUB>2</SUB> storage aquifers at basin scale.</P><P>The storage integrity of these aquifers will have to be ensured over centuries. Our monitoring philosophy will have to be reviewed, particularly for large-scale storages. Large scale modellings of the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide’s dissolution within brine, of the “CO<SUB>2</SUB> plume shape”, or of various geological breaking mechanisms will have to be tackled.</P><P>Because wellbores (injectors, legacy wells) are often considered the primary potential source of leakage in CO<SUB>2</SUB> storage projects, research and development efforts will be focused on insuring their integrity.</P><P>There are five research area:</P><UL><LI>Evaluation of CO<SUB>2</SUB> storage capacity of saline aquifers and depleted hydro<mark>carbon</mark> reservoirs (capacity classifications, large scale modelling, geochemical impacts, etc.);</LI><LI>CO<SUB>2</SUB> Well injectivity;</LI><LI>Geomechanical stability of storage (structural geology, fault modelling, geomechanical and seismic domains);</LI><LI>Monitoring (geophysical and non-geophysical techniques).</LI></UL><P>CO<SUB>2</SUB> storage is the only viable way to deal with large volumes of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, which therefore makes CCUS an efficient tool for <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation. The International Energy Agency anticipates that before 2050, around 100 billion tonnes of CO<SUB>2 </SUB>need to be captured and stored. CO<SUB>2</SUB> storage capacities at scale, which can achieve the CO<SUB>2</SUB> abatements required to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark> and eliminate greenhouse gas emissions in the main emitting regions of the world (Europe, North America, China, India and the Middle East) remain to be secured.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Additionally, Canada's December 2011 decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol—<A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16151310"" target=""_blank"" title=""based"">based</A> on domestic economic concerns as well as its view that the world's top greenhouse gas emitters have refused to ratify the accord—has generated concerns that the Kyoto Protocol itself may be in danger of collapse. Both of these concerns and many other issues will likely be a part of the agenda for the COP-18, scheduled for November 2012 in Qatar.</P><H2>Strengths and Weaknesses</H2><P><STRONG>Overall assessment: </STRONG><EM>An underdeveloped and inadequate system</EM></P><P>The current centerpieces for multilateral action against <mark>climate change</mark> are the <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.cfr.org/publication/9267/united_nations_framework_convention_on_<mark>climate</mark>_change.html"" target=""_blank"">United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark></A> (UNFCCC), its associated <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.cfr.org/publication/8864/"" target=""_blank"">Kyoto Protocol</A>, the <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.cfr.org/publication/21028/copenhagen_accord.html"" target=""_blank"">Copenhagen Accord</A>, and the COP-17 <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.cfr.org/<mark>climate</mark>-change/durban-platform-enhanced-action-december-2011/p26761"" target=""_blank"">Durban Platform for Enhanced Action</A> (&quot;Durban Platform&quot;). The Kyoto Protocol includes firm commitments to curb emissions only from developed countries, but does not include the United States, and has no meaningful consequences for noncompliance; it has also come under unprecedented strain as Canada officially <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16151310"" target=""_blank"" title=""withdrew"">withdrew</A> from the accord in December 2011.

As Japan and Russia could soon follow Canada's example, the hopes for a legally binding <mark>climate</mark> accord—even if desirable—may be fading. Additionally, the regime, which allows for numerous exemptions regarding greenhouse gas emissions, fails to provide emerging big emitters like China and India with meaningful targets and incentives to curb their emissions. The architecture for global <mark>climate</mark> governance looks particularly shaky after the <A class=""processed"" href=""http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_15/items/5257.php"" target=""_blank"" title=""fifteenth Conference of Parties"">fifteenth Conference of Parties</A> (COP-15), in Copenhagen, failed to overcome entrenched differences among the major parties and deliver targeted emissions cuts. Following Copenhagen, COP-16, in Cancun, made <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.cfr.org/energyenvironment/cancun-outcome-modest-step-forward/p23617"" target=""_blank"">some strides</A> toward effective multilateral action, but the regime still falls well short of promoting needed action to effect positive change, including committing to a post–Kyoto framework.</P><P>Similarly, little progress was made during the COP-17 meeting in Durban. While parties agreed to extend the Kyoto Protocol until at least 2017 as well as solidified an operating structure for the Green <mark>Climate</mark> Fund, little was clarified concerning the form of a successor accord to the Kyoto Protocol. Delegates to the COP-17 did agree, however, that the new accord would include reduction targets for all nations, rather than exclusively those considered to be developed.</P><P>Although delegations at Durban, Cancun, and Copenhagen developed reporting mechanisms, funding pledges, and unilaterally declared country-specific emissions reduction goals, the ongoing lack of an international enforcement body has left these promises largely empty.</P><P>The limitations of the <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.cfr.org/<mark>climate</mark>-change/durban-platform-enhanced-action-december-2011/p26761"" target=""_blank"">Durban Platform</A>, as well as the increasingly tenuous status of the Kyoto Protocol, have created a fresh imperative for global action on <mark>climate change</mark>. The tension between developing and developed countries is fueled by ongoing disagreements over how to interpret a fundamental underpinning of the UNFCCC and Kyoto framework—namely, the principle of &quot;<A class=""processed"" href=""http://cisdl.org/public/docs/news/brief_common.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""common but differentiated responsibilities"">common but differentiated responsibilities</A>&quot; [PDF] among industrialized (Annex I) and developing (non-Annex I) countries, particularly when it comes to establishing and achieving meaningful mitigation targets. The 2010 UN <mark>climate change</mark> summit in Cancun did not achieve a comprehensive international framework, nor did it expect to. The agenda was pushed to the 2011 meetings in Durban, South Africa, where the Kyoto Protocol was <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-comments/past-issues/volume-17-2011/december/durbans-surprise-<mark>climate</mark>-deal/"" target=""_blank"" title=""extended"">extended</A> for another five years at least. Concerns, however, arose over the refusals of India, China, and the United States to unequivocally accept legally binding admissions targets at the meeting, placing doubt on the extent that other significant greenhouse gas emitters will participate in the new commitment window.</P><P>At the most basic level, countries disagree over <mark>climate</mark> monitoring and financing stipulations in the Kyoto Protocol and other legally binding accords. <mark>Climate</mark> frameworks struggle to effectively monitor greenhouse gas outputs, especially in developing countries. Many countries lack the domestic capacity to audit their total emissions; even if they are able to monitor national levels, some fear that reporting such numbers would encourage international pressure to cap their emissions. Others, like China, argue that an international monitoring system represents an infringement on national sovereignty and that developing states should be afforded some leniency in emissions as they are currently in critical stages of <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/08/science/earth/at-<mark>climate</mark>-talks-a-familiar-standoff-emerges-between-the-united-states-and-china.html?_r=1&amp;scp=8&amp;sq=durban&amp;st=cse"" target=""_blank"" title=""economic development"">economic development</A>.</P><P>Additionally, the <mark>climate</mark> regime does not adequately address the sources of financing needed to help developing countries cope with <mark>climate change</mark>. While the meeting in Copenhagen witnessed political progress, including pledges by industrialized countries to provide $100 billion by 2020 to developed countries and the Green <mark>Climate</mark> Fund was put into place at Cancun, concrete funding streams have yet to materialize. While the COP-17 attempted to clarify how the Green <mark>Climate</mark> Fund would operate and disperse funds, <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.nature.com/news/<mark>climate</mark>-deal-leaves-questions-on-green-fund-and-tech-transfer-1.9638"" target=""_blank"" title=""little"">little</A> firm monetary support was allocated to the mechanism.

The MEF was launched in March 2009 as a successor to the Bush administration's Major Economies Meeting (MEM). The seventeen-member MEF, which includes countries responsible for approximately 80 percent of global emissions, has provided an arena for major emitting countries to confront tricky issues and hammer out viable strategies without entering the labyrinth of UN diplomacy.

Even these niche fora, however, are not immune to <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/world/europe/28iht-<mark>climate</mark>28.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""political rancor"">political rancor</A> over legally binding emissions cuts.</P><P>Despite concern that alternative efforts to the UNFCCC process might undermine the credibility and success of that universal forum, the MEF and the parallel G20 have the potential to complement the UN track by enabling meaningful dialogue among the countries whose financial commitments and solutions on mitigation and technology truly matter. The MEF and G20 offer leaders a setting for candid dialogue where parties can meet to negotiate new bilateral and &quot;minilateral&quot; arrangements, align parallel domestic initiatives and regulatory approaches, and monitor each other's progress as part of an informal, &quot;pledge and review&quot; process. Accomplishments of the MEF and G20 include, respectively, launching a Global Partnership on Clean Energy Technologies and reaching an <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.cfr.org/publication/20304/g20_leaders_statement_at_pittsburgh_summit.html"" target=""_blank"">agreement</A> to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. In September 2011 the MEF reportedly <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.majoreconomiesforum.org/past-meetings/the-eleventh-leaders.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""held"">held</A> a &quot;frank discussion&quot; regarding the COP-17 meeting in Durban and the future of the Kyoto Protocol among other issues.</P><P>Beyond the UNFCCC process and minilateral forums like the MEF and G20, <mark>climate change</mark> is increasingly addressed by a host of other international actors whose primary mandate may not explicitly include <mark>climate change</mark>. Within the UN system alone, some twenty agencies work on <mark>climate change</mark>, often through their own specific lens. The implementation of projects, for example, is spread across institutions like the <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.unep.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""United Nations Environment Program"">United Nations Environment Program</A> (UNEP), the <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.gefweb.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Global Environment Facility"">Global Environment Facility</A> (GEF), the <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.undp.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""United Nations Development Program"">United Nations Development Program</A> (UNDP), and the <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.worldbank.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""World Bank"">World Bank</A>, which work alongside bilateral agencies on mitigation and adaptation projects in developing countries. Although a proliferation of actors focused on this agenda is not necessarily negative, the lack of coordinated policies and programs can be a problem when it leads to redundancy. In part, this fragmentation reflects the inherent complexity of <mark>climate change</mark>, which has substantive connections to many issue areas, including development, finance, public health, energy, and security.</P><P><STRONG>Understanding <mark>climate change</mark> threats: </STRONG><EM>Strong but could be improved</EM></P><P>The international <mark>climate</mark> regime is at its strongest when it comes to understanding the threats posed by <mark>climate change</mark>. Such efforts, which are centered on the <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>"">Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark></A> (IPCC), predate any other dedicated element of the regime. Yet, the infiltration of politics into the <mark>climate change</mark> debate has hampered the legitimacy and pervasiveness of new findings.</P><P>The IPCC was created in 1988 to review, assess, and synthesize the world's scientific information related to <mark>climate change</mark>.

The IPCC <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/"" target=""_blank"" title=""reports"">reports</A> [PDF] are central in policy discussions of <mark>climate change</mark>, and their estimates play an outsized role in setting benchmarks for international action. The IPCC also produces occasional reports on urgent subjects such as <mark>carbon</mark> capture and technology transfer.</P><P>The IPCC is not without its critics, however, and a series of scandals concerning the methods of its reporting has somewhat weakened its legitimacy. Some have <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changereconsidered.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""accused"">accused</A> its reports of being politically driven—their summaries must be signed off on by all member governments—and overplaying the state of agreement on man-made <mark>climate change</mark>. Reacting to the findings of an independent review, the IPCC introduced institutional <A class=""processed"" href=""http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/<mark>climate</mark>-panel-announces-reforms/?scp=17&amp;sq=<mark>climate</mark>%20change&amp;st=cse"" target=""_blank"" title=""reforms"">reforms</A> in May 2011 to address some of these concerns.

Within the community of experts on <mark>climate</mark> science, few believe that IPCC reports overestimate the state of the problem.</P><P>The IPCC has also been criticized, from the other side, for <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19981"" target=""_blank"" title=""underplaying"">underplaying</A> the risks of extreme <mark>climate change</mark>, again because of the need for political consensus. Similarly, it has been criticized as lagging behind the current state of science because of its long and bureaucratic approval process. At a time when many studies are raising the possibility of extreme <mark>climate change</mark>, this may tend to bias the IPCC conservatively.</P><P>International cooperation on scientific observation and analysis has also benefited from several other forums for sharing global <mark>climate</mark> data. These include the <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.earthobservations.org/about_geo.shtml"" target=""_blank"" title=""Group on Earth Observations"">Group on Earth Observations</A> (GEO), a group of eighty governments committed to creating a <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.earthobservations.org/geoss.shtml"" target=""_blank"" title=""Global Earth Observation System of Systems"">Global Earth Observation System of Systems</A> (GEOSS) as a common source for detailed data on everything related to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Despite these gains in researching, analyzing, and understanding <mark>climate change</mark>, a great deal of basic scientific work remains in clarifying the state of scientific opinion on the anthropogenic causes of <mark>climate change</mark> and ways to mitigate their effects. In addition, the international community needs to expand cooperation efforts in collecting data on the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> to facilitate adaptation and early warning systems.</P><P><STRONG>Curbing emissions: </STRONG><EM>Some progress, but too few commitments</EM></P><P>Many countries with mandatory targets under the <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.cfr.org/publication/8864/"" target=""_blank"">Kyoto Protocol</A> are on track to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, and large emitters such as China, India, and Brazil <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-21/china-india-brazil-pledge-emission-limits-to-united-nations-<mark>climate</mark>-body.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""suggest"">suggest</A> that they will take voluntary steps to control levels of anthropogenic <mark>pollution</mark>.

Additionally, the December 2011 <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.cfr.org/<mark>climate</mark>-change/durban-platform-enhanced-action-december-2011/p26761"" target=""_blank"">Durban Platform</A> committed UNFCCC parties to establish a more universal post–Kyoto accord with &quot;legal force,&quot; and in December 2012 at the UNFCCC COP-18, parties agreed to extend the Kyoto commitment period to 2020 and to enter into negotiations for a treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol in 2015. However, not all parties agreed to this second round of commitments and major emitters like Canada and Japan opted out.</P><P>The variance between commitment and action remains an obstacle to the development of a comprehensive solution. The non-binding Copenhagen Accord did little to force country-by-country accountability and action. The 2010 Cancun Agreement brought greenhouse gas reduction pledges under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, but it remains to be seen if Cancun's call for international assessment of implementation of these mitigation efforts will lead to substantive gains beyond the status quo. A shift in focus from diplomatic discussion over pledges to implementation is one positive outcome of the Cancun Conference.</P><P>The IPCC has called for a reduction in emissions to limit the increase in global temperatures by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Although leaders at Copenhagen and Cancun used the same number to determine their mitigation pledges, the current growth in emissions, absent significant action on <mark>climate change</mark>, will cause an average global temperatures of 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the most recent analysis produced by the <A class=""processed"" href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>interactive.org/scoreboard"" target=""_blank"" title=""<mark>Climate</mark> Interactive Scoreboard""><mark>Climate</mark> Interactive Scoreboard</A>.</P><P>The core policy and regulatory instruments to curb greenhouse gas emissions exist at the national level, and performance therefore varies from country to country. At the international level, the Kyoto Protocol provides three mechanisms that can help countries control their emissions through flexible arrangements. The <A class=""processed"" href=""http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/clean_development_mechanism/items/2718.php"" target=""_blank"" title=""Clean Development Mechanism"">Clean Development Mechanism</A> (CDM) allows industrialized countries to invest in <mark>climate</mark>-friendly projects in poor countries and earn <mark>carbon</mark> credits in exchange. The <A class=""processed"" href=""http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/joint_implementation/items/1674.php"" target=""_blank"" title=""Joint Implementation"">Joint Implementation</A> (JI) mechanism enables industrialized countries to invest in <mark>climate</mark>-friendly projects in other industrialized countries and earn <mark>carbon</mark> credits in exchange. Lastly, <A class=""processed"" href=""http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/emissions_trading/items/2731.php"" target=""_blank"" title=""emissions trading"">emissions trading</A> creates a market for trading <mark>carbon</mark> credits with countries that are over their target.</P><P>From the beginning, the most promising of the three was the CDM, which provides twin benefits of curbing emissions and facilitating economic development for non-Annex I countries. However, experts have pointed to inadequacies regarding its operations and its inability to deliver lower emissions at acceptable costs. In particular, the CDM is burdened with extensive bureaucratic entanglements that have delayed the actual registry of many preapproved projects. More seriously, <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/339d6690-d212-11de-a0f0-00144feabdc0,dwp_uuid=d68cb1fc-a38d-11de-a435-00144feabdc0.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""critics"">critics</A> blame the CDM for earning some companies heaps of <mark>carbon</mark> credits for low-cost changes, noting that national regulation or other means of financing emissions reductions might have been better alternatives.

This process tasks countries to publish emissions reductions goals in line with their national capabilities and then submit to international monitoring under the Copenhagen Accord.</P><P>The barriers to improving emissions monitoring in developing countries are threefold. First, many such countries lack the domestic capacity to monitor their own emissions, which makes international monitoring even more difficult. Existing emissions estimates are generally extrapolations based on energy use, and even large developing countries such as China and India, for example, do not know their total emissions output. This uncertainty is <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/2012/July-August%202012/forest-full.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""exacerbated"">exacerbated</A> in countries with significant emissions from deforestation because the technical means to precisely measure such emissions do not yet exist. Second, even if developing countries are able to monitor their emissions, many are wary that reporting emissions would open them to pressure to cap those emissions—something they have strongly resisted. Third, countries such as China publically <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=india-proposes-global-greenhouse-gas"" target=""_blank"" title=""state"">state</A> that concessions for an internationally verifiable monitoring system are a direct infringement on their national sovereignty. Despite these barriers, an agreement that focuses on emissions monitoring might be easier to implement than an arrangement based on binding emissions reductions.</P><P>Enforcement, meanwhile, is essentially nonexistent. Countries that fail to meet their Kyoto targets are <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.tfsgreen.com/global-markets/kyoto-protocol/compliance-procedures.php"" target=""_blank"" title=""legally required"">legally required</A> to subtract that shortfall (plus a 30 percent penalty) from their total allowed emissions in the next phase of the protocol. In practice, though, this is meaningless, given that future allowed emissions have not yet been negotiated.

In moving towards a post–Kyoto agreement due to come into force in 2020, the international community should remain cognizant of certain trends that emerged during and immediately after the COP-17.</P><P>This, for one, includes acknowledging growing cracks among countries in the developing world regarding accepting binding emissions targets—an issue of critical concern to small island developing states in the Pacific and other areas. These fissures should be explored as much as possible to both create a global consensus regarding the creation of major greenhouse gas emissions targets and to isolate intransigent countries. Second, the global financial crisis cannot become a catch-all excuse to avoid meeting pledges for global <mark>climate change</mark> finance mechanisms like the Green <mark>Climate</mark> Fund. While the $50 million in seed money <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/outcome-in-durban-offers-limited-progress-1361.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""promised"">promised</A> during the COP-17 is an excellent start, more—much more—is needed as the environmental effects of <mark>climate change</mark> become increasingly apparent around the world. Importantly, the narrative among developed economies must change because waiting to act will be substantially more costly than action now. Third, the international community must not let its existing accomplishments on <mark>climate change</mark>—such as the Kyoto Protocol itself—fall by the wayside as it struggles to develop new alternatives for a comprehensive <mark>climate change</mark> accord. Canada's December 2011 decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol should be interpreted as a crystal clear warning that the agreement is increasingly at risk of unraveling. As a result, countries such as the United States, China, and India need to place a fresh emphasis on their commitments to combat <mark>climate change</mark>, including providing clear, reasonable, and practical indications as to their expectations for a post-Kyoto accord. Even though the <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.cfr.org/<mark>climate</mark>-change/durban-platform-enhanced-action-december-2011/p26761"" target=""_blank"">Durban Platform's</A> call for a 2020 accord—which would apply both to developed and developing states—with &quot;legal force&quot; does not necessarily imply &quot;legally binding,&quot; the time for big emitters like the United States to simply stay the course on <mark>climate change</mark> has expired.</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Reform, Refresh, and Renew the Clean Development Mechanism</STRONG></LI></UL><P>The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) has come under fire on many fronts. Some have argued that too many nonadditional projects (those that would have reduced emissions even without the CDM) have been approved; others argue that the project approval process is too stringent. And others have argued that because it has no legal life beyond Kyoto, it will fail to bring about lasting results. These criticisms have on various occasions been right.</P><P>Scrapping the CDM entirely is not likely to be politically feasible, especially considering the COP-17 decision to extend the Kyoto Protocol for at least another five years. Reforming the CDM will thus be necessary to ensure that money is not wasted and that large volumes of offset credits remain available. The international community should reform CDM to focus on the least developed countries and on activities that are unquestionably additional. It should focus on sector-based trading for other countries. This could allow crediting for sectors that beat aggressive preset baselines, without penalizing them for exceeding those baselines. At the same time, the UNFCCC will need to work on streamlining the CDM approval process. Ideally, the CDM bureaucracy could be substantially reduced if CDM governance were shifted more to the countries providing funds.</P><P>The recent <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2120679/durban-diplomats-jostle-position-ahead-crucial-summit"" target=""_blank"" title=""announcement"">announcement</A> of a year-long CDM reform consultation process as well as the <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/<mark>sustainable</mark>-business/blog/durban-cop17-outcome?newsfeed=true"" target=""_blank"" title=""decision"">decision</A> during the COP-17 in Durban to formally include <mark>carbon</mark> capture storage projects under the CDM are significant first steps. However, both must be followed by firm policy action to keep the CDM relevant and economically <mark>sustainable</mark>.</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Force progress in U.S. domestic <mark>climate change</mark> policy</STRONG></LI></UL><P>The failure to pass comprehensive U.S. <mark>climate</mark> legislation, with a sweeping <mark>carbon</mark> cap-and-trade at its base, is a significant setback to U.S. mitigation efforts. Cutting U.S. emissions remains an essential step toward a <mark>climate</mark>-change solution at home and abroad, providing not only an environmentally sound solution to the problem, but giving the United States leverage in international bargaining as well. The increasingly intractable position of the United States became more apparent during the COP-17 meeting in Durban. There, the United States faced nearly universal criticism for not showing the leadership necessary to address <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>While a cap-and-trade system remains ideal, deep cuts in U.S. emissions can be pursued in a variety of ways, including energy-efficiency regulations, subsidies for renewable energy, and <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.novoco.com/energy/index.php"" target=""_blank"" title=""tax incentives"">tax incentives</A> for low-<mark>carbon</mark> technologies.

One way for Obama to force progress is to issue more executive orders and administrative rulemakings to partially substitute for Congressional opposition to his <mark>climate</mark> and energy agenda. Working through the EPA and the Clean Air Act, he could enact tougher rules that would cut <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> from power plants and mitigate the potential effects of the failure to enact a national cap-and-trade program. An agreement reached with the auto industry in July 2011 to double fuel standards to fifty-four miles per gallon by 2025 is also a step in the right direction, provided that its stipulations are enforced. Other significant measures the administration can take include government procurement of renewable energy and energy-efficient products and services, and reductions in subsidies for fossil fuel-related research and extraction. Perhaps one of the most significant steps President Obama can take towards realizing his <mark>climate change</mark> policy is to strike a deal with China to reduce global emissions of <mark>CO2</mark>. The two nations combined account for 40 percent of the world's <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>, so a bilateral agreement could mollify Obama's opponents in Congress and encourage other nations to follow suit.</P><P>In the longer term, the United States and its international partners should consider the following steps:</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Build a credible institution or institutions for measuring, reporting, and verifying global emissions and emissions-cutting efforts</STRONG></LI></UL><P>Countries will not make strong efforts to reduce emissions unless they are confident that others are playing their part. Nor will wealthier countries provide financial or technological assistance to poorer counterparts unless they are confident that the efforts they support will actually be implemented.</P><P>This demands robust institutional capacity to verify that countries are making the cuts and investing in the emissions-cutting actions that they claim to be. The precise approach to this could take <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.e3g.org/index.php/about/news-articles/e3g-wri-side-event-at-unfccc-mrv-institutions-and-issues1/"" target=""_blank"" title=""multiple forms"">multiple forms</A>, with the task falling primarily to the international level at one extreme, and domestic institutions at the other. At a minimum, an international institution will need to aggregate national-level reporting; this might usefully happen under the aegis of the UNFCCC. Other lessons in monitoring and verification might be learned from experience with the WTO, IMF, and OECD.</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Reform Bretton Woods and UN institutions</STRONG></LI></UL><P>Institutions that support global economic development have a large potential role in promoting low-<mark>carbon</mark> growth and adaptation to <mark>climate change</mark>. The <A class=""processed"" href=""http://beta.worldbank.org/<mark>climate</mark>change/"" target=""_blank"" title=""World Bank"">World Bank</A>, along with the regional development banks, has unique capacity to mobilize large amounts of capital for the sorts of investments that will be needed in low-<mark>carbon</mark> infrastructure. Several UN organizations, such as the <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.undp.org/<mark>climate</mark>change/"" target=""_blank"" title=""United Nations Development Program"">United Nations Development Program</A> and <A class=""processed"" href=""http://www.unep.org/<mark>climate</mark>change/"" target=""_blank"" title=""United Nations Environment Program"">United Nations Environment Program</A>, lack the ability to handle such large infrastructure projects but can play a major role in building relevant capacity in developing countries. All these organizations would benefit from both clear strategies for supporting <mark>climate</mark> action and increased related funding.</P><P>They might also, more controversially, consider promoting policy shifts through conditionality on their assistance. For example, the World Bank might condition assistance in increasing energy supply on efforts to moderate demand through subsidy reform. Such steps would be difficult politically but would not be unprecedented.</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Set up substantial international funds for low-<mark>carbon</mark> technology finance</STRONG></LI></UL><P>International financial transfers in support of low-<mark>carbon</mark> development have occurred principally through <mark>carbon</mark> finance (i.e., offsets). Yet offsets are often an inefficient way of financially supporting low-<mark>carbon</mark> development. Many countries lack the capacity to administer robust offset systems yet could benefit from financial support for emissions-cutting activities. Offset schemes also often overpay, sometimes massively, for reductions; dedicated funds could remove that waste. Funds can also be targeted at eliminating specific problems that stand in the way of private financial flows, by offering tailored products like risk guarantees and concessional loans. Funds can also target opportunities that are difficult to quantify for the purposes of offsets, such as investments in public transportation and long-distance grid infrastructure, or avoided deforestation, where measuring emissions changes is difficult.</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Make <mark>climate change</mark> a regular Group of Twenty agenda item</STRONG></LI></UL><P>Dealing with <mark>climate change</mark> will require high-level political leadership and deal-making of a sort that is difficult to achieve through formal negotiations with the 194 parties to the <A class=""processed"" href=""http://unfccc.int/key_documents/the_convention/items/2853.php"" target=""_blank"" title=""UN Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark>"">UN Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark></A> by dedicated <mark>climate</mark> diplomats alone.

Since 1980, there have been <A href=""https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events.pdf"">218 disasters</A> across the United States with costs topping $1 billion. The Congressional Research Service reported earlier this year that inflation-adjusted disaster appropriations have <A href=""https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/682765.pdf"">shot up 46 percent</A> from a median of $6.2 billion between 2000 and 2006 to $9.1 billion between 2007 and 2013.</P><P id=""1iEgsX"">And the price of disaster damage is <A href=""https://www.gao.gov/assets/670/666697.pdf"">continuing to go up</A>, according to the Government Accountability Office.</P><P id=""zEXP0j"">Part of it is that the hurricanes this year really were immense, but they have a bigger impact when they collide with growing cities. As more people compete for real estate, <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-22/here-are-four-charts-showing-u-s-housing-momentum-entering-2018"">property values have skyrocketed</A> in Florida and California.

To project just how much damage each U.S. county will incur by century's end, researchers ran 29,000 simulations of the U.S. economy, with results informed by weather-driven damages they detected in six domains–agriculture, crime, health, energy demand, labor, and coastal communities—between 1981 and 2010. Heat, for example, may increase crime or cause corn yields to fall, but it also could lower fatalities driven by exposure to the cold. The resulting prediction, though quite fallible in its inability to predict how humans will adapt to warming, foresees a country where, if fossil fuels continue to pour <mark>carbon</mark> into the atmosphere, <A href=""http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aal4369"">the United States will divide further into a country of haves and have nots</A>. Not surprisingly, Atlantic coastal communities are projected to take a toll from rising seas and strengthening hurricanes, but also much of the South and Midwest will be hurt by a decline in farming caused by rising temperatures, along with increasing energy demands to keep up with the heat. Meanwhile, states in the north and northwest could see their fortunes mildly boosted by warming, with farming yields rising thanks to shorter winters and less need to ward off harsh cold in homes. That’s not enough to counteract an overall negative trend for the country, which, if the planet warmed by 6°C from preindustrial levels, could suffer damage worth 6% of its gross domestic product, the team reports today in <CITE>Science</CITE>. The results, shown in the above map (red means total economic damage and blue is total economic benefit; projections are for 2080-2100), could guide states and the federal government toward the communities most in need of help adapting to the changed <mark>climate</mark>—should lawmakers choose to act.</P></DIV><FOOTER class=""article__foot""><DIV class=""meta-line"" style=""margin-bottom: .5em"">Posted in: </DIV></FOOTER></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

She was defending his hiring, arguing that he held views that many people hold, and that perhaps allowing him to put them on the pages of the <EM>New York Times </EM>would allow the paper to regain its position as a news source that can be trusted by people on both sides of the political spectrum. She was right that the public no longer seems to agree on what truth is, but she was wrong that bringing Stephens on would help us resolve this.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text-2 text parbase section""><P>His <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/opinion/<mark>climate</mark>-of-complete-certainty.html?_r=0"">debut column</A>, “<mark>Climate</mark> of Complete Certainty,” published on Friday, supports my theory. The thesis of the column is that we would do well to remember that there are fair reasons why people might be skeptical of <mark>climate change</mark>, and that claiming certainty on the matter will only backfire. He casts himself as a translator between the skeptics and the believers, offering a lesson “for anyone who wants to advance the cause of good <mark>climate policy</mark>.” Technically, he doesn’t get any facts wrong. Painting himself as a moderate, he says it is “indisputable” that warming is happening and is caused by humans.

(I would assert that we certainly have not forgotten it, since it’s the <A href=""https://theoutline.com/post/1400/political-diversity-is-a-cop-out-for-overpaid-media-men"">entire reason why Stephens now has his job</A>, but no matter.)</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-5 section""><P>He then goes on to compare the Clinton failure and the science on <mark>climate change</mark>. “Isn’t this one instance, at least, where 100 percent of the truth resides on one side of the argument?” he asks facetiously.</P></DIV><DIV class=""pullquotebox section""><ASIDE class=""pullquote""><P class=""quote"">Stephens suggests that the rational way to go forward with a conversation about <mark>climate change</mark> is to admit that <mark>climate change</mark> might not be certain.</P></ASIDE></DIV><DIV class=""text text-6 parbase section""><P>I will be honest, I do not know what “100 percent of the truth” means.

Stephens does not call a single fact into question throughout his piece.

His argument is convincing because the institutions he mentions can make mistakes. It’s true, there are some problems with <A href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/07/statistics_and_psychology_multiple_comparisons_give_spurious_results.html"">how we use probabilities in science</A>.

The westward shifts are partially associated with the increased moisture availability in the western regions of the study area, coupled with decreased moisture availability in the southeastern regions. Although plants are unlikely to experience precipitation as a direct impact on physiology, they can track changes in water availability through multiple mechanisms, such as their ability to deal with drought, as shown in previous observational studies (<A id=""xref-ref-3-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-3""><EM>3</EM></A>, <A id=""xref-ref-22-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-22""><EM>22</EM></A>) and modeling simulations (<A id=""xref-ref-30-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-30""><EM>30</EM></A>, <A id=""xref-ref-31-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-31""><EM>31</EM></A>). The correlation between changes in drought index and species abundance further confirms the importance of moisture availability and/or tolerance, which is also underscored by the fact that the species that shifted significantly westward are those with relatively high drought tolerance. Although the western portion of the study area has increased in moisture availability during the study period, it is still considerably drier compared to the eastern part (fig. S1). However, species with medium and high drought tolerance can take the advantage of the increased moisture availability in the relatively dry region. Future studies using finer measures of physiological traits such as embolism resistance could better address moisture-related mechanisms on species response to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P id=""p-26"">As expected, we also found evidence of poleward shifts in abundance, which is more prominent in high latitudes where substantial warming has occurred during the study period. Our abundance-based poleward shift rate (11.0 km per decade) is similar to a previous estimated rate (10 km per decade) that is based on leading/trailing edges for forests in the eastern United States (<A id=""xref-ref-23-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-23""><EM>23</EM></A>). The fact that the longitudinal shift was 1.4 times faster than latitudinal shift suggests that vegetation dynamics are more sensitive to precipitation than to temperature, at least in a near-term time frame, because moisture availability is considered a critical factor in forest dynamics of eastern North America (<A id=""xref-ref-32-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-32""><EM>32</EM></A>). When considering the predominantly westward and northward shifts of tree species, it is important to understand the geographical settings of the study area, because it has hard boundaries to the east and south (that is, ocean) but soft boundaries to the west and north (that is, <mark>climate</mark> limitations). Nevertheless, abundance shifts could still be observed even if species ranges are limited by the ocean.</P><P id=""p-27"">It is not surprising that saplings have experienced a higher proportion and faster rate in poleward and westward shifts than adult trees, because new recruitments (that is, young trees) are expected to respond to <mark>climate change</mark> more quickly (<A id=""xref-ref-23-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-23""><EM>23</EM></A>, <A id=""xref-ref-24-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-24""><EM>24</EM></A>). The observed differential shift rates could also be due to the fact that saplings are more sensitive to droughts in terms of survival than adult trees (<A id=""xref-ref-25-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-25""><EM>25</EM></A>), as substantial drought was observed in the southeastern region of the study area during the study period. The differential shift rates among subpopulations in the four cardinal quadrants further confirmed that the observed range shift is primarily due to the changes in the leading edges of species distribution ranges, which agreed with early findings by Woodall <EM>et al</EM>. (<A id=""xref-ref-23-4"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-23""><EM>23</EM></A>) of significant poleward shifts of seedlings for most of the northern species in the eastern United States.</P><P id=""p-28"">The observed trait- and phylogenetic-specific spatial shift in species’ abundance is fascinating (most angiosperms shifted westward whereas most gymnosperms shifted poleward). There are several mechanisms that could explain these traits and phylogenetic-specific responses. The lack of westward shift in gymnosperms might be partially explained by the fact that gymnosperms have lower maximum growth rates than angiosperms as a result of their less efficient water transport systems (<A id=""xref-ref-19-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-19""><EM>19</EM></A>), making them less competitive in the western portion of the study area, which is drier than the eastern portion (fig. S1). The association between seed size and directional movement of certain species is also interesting and is potentially related to the different colonization, tolerance, and competitive strategies used by different species (<A id=""xref-ref-33-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-33""><EM>33</EM></A>, <A id=""xref-ref-34-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-34""><EM>34</EM></A>). However, there are large variabilities in seed size among species, and seed size is embedded in a complex of many other traits that together define the life history of a tree species (<A id=""xref-ref-35-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-35""><EM>35</EM></A>). The association between the observed spatial shift and wood density is also an interesting one. Low wood density is often associated with fast growth, whereas high wood density is often associated with high survival (<A id=""xref-ref-36-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-36""><EM>36</EM></A>), which can partially explain the observed southward and westward shift of high wood density species. Because the southern region of the study area experienced droughts and the western part was relatively dry, species with high wood density might have a better chance to survive.</P><P id=""p-29"">The predominantly northward shift of gymnosperm trees, along with all <EM>Populus</EM> species and most <EM>Betula</EM> species, is intriguing. The mechanism for the northward shift could potentially be linked to species pollination methods because we found that most wind-pollinated species (most gymnosperms and some angiosperms) shifted northward while animal-pollinated species (most angiosperms) shifted southward. Similar northward shifts of clades were observed in the New England area during the early Holocene (between 10,000 and 8000 years ago), where <EM>Picea</EM> was replaced by <EM>Pinus</EM>, followed by <EM>Betula</EM> and then <EM>Quercus</EM> species (<A id=""xref-ref-37-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-37""><EM>37</EM></A>). However, the historical process took place over several thousand years, whereas the observed shift in this study happened in a few decades, suggesting the impacts of recent <mark>climate change</mark>, along with other nonclimatic factors (for example, land use change and forest management), on vegetation dynamics.</P><P id=""p-30"">These trait- and phylogenetic-specific shifts can have profound implications for the resilience and sustainability of the studied forest ecosystems, because phylogenetic relatedness among species can have strong influences on community assemblage and composition (<A id=""xref-ref-38-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-38""><EM>38</EM></A>). Because some closely related species groups (both in functional traits and in evolutionary history) have different responses to the changing <mark>climate</mark> compared to other groups, the resultant differing spatial shifts among various groups can lead to the possible marked reduction of some evolutionary lineages. The reduction or replacement of certain species in a community can be consequential, because species can have substantially different effects on ecosystem structure, function, and services, and the impacts can cascade through a broad range of ecosystem processes (<A id=""xref-ref-39-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-39""><EM>39</EM></A>, <A id=""xref-ref-40-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-40""><EM>40</EM></A>).</P><P id=""p-31"">Given the broad scale at which our analysis was conducted, a variety of indirect and nonclimatic factors (for example, fire regimes, invasive species, forest management, conservation efforts, and land use change) could also have influenced the directional trends observed. The fact that the observed abundance change is positively correlated with the densification of forests, which is often attributed to diminishing fire frequency and severity (<A id=""xref-ref-26-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-26""><EM>26</EM></A>), confirms that nonclimatic factors are also responsible for the observed spatial shift of species abundance. Heavy infestations of invasive insects, plants, and pathogens could contribute to species shifts in other directions (<A id=""xref-ref-41-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-41""><EM>41</EM></A>, <A id=""xref-ref-42-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-42""><EM>42</EM></A>). In addition, forest conservation and plantation efforts in the study area such as those by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Conservation Reserve Program could also influence the observed spatial shift. Nevertheless, we observed clear broad-scale evidence of the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on forest tree spatial dynamics, where changes in mean annual precipitation alone explained about 19% of the variability in species abundance change and spatial shift. It could be beneficial for future studies to investigate the impacts of inter- and intra-annual variability of moisture availability at finer spatial and temporal resolutions (for example, for droughts and floods) on vegetation dynamics, given the high likelihood of more variable precipitation patterns in the future (<A id=""xref-ref-43-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-43""><EM>43</EM></A>). In addition, because more repeated plot-level measures are becoming available across the regional scale, we can better study the degree to which <mark>climate change</mark> induces new community assemblages owing to the varying mortality and recruitment and/or competitive release of different trait- and phylogenetic-specific groups. These repeated measures may eventually enable the analysis of more tree species in the eastern U.S. forests, rather than the selected ones in this study, allowing the detection of phylogenetic- and trait-specific patterns that might be undetected in the current analysis.</P><P id=""p-32"">In summary, trees in the eastern United States have experienced prominent westward and northward shifts in response to <mark>climate change</mark> and successional processes. These spatial shifts are more sensitive to the changes in moisture availability than to changes in temperature. The observed spatial shifts are associated with species that have similar functional traits and evolutionary histories. The resultant divergent spatial shifts among various groups can have significant ecological consequences and possible extinction of certain evolutionary lineages in some forest communities. Management actions to increase forest ecosystems’ resilience to <mark>climate change</mark> should consider the changes in both temperature and precipitation.</P></DIV><DIV class=""section materials-methods"" id=""sec-7""><H2 class="""">MATERIALS AND METHODS</H2><P id=""p-33"">We obtained tree abundance data from the U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program from two different inventory periods (Supplementary Text). FIA provides a long-term data set of forest conditions across all forest land in the United States, which has been used to study regional spatial and temporal forest dynamics (<A id=""xref-ref-23-5"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-23""><EM>23</EM></A>, <A id=""xref-ref-24-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-24""><EM>24</EM></A>, <A id=""xref-ref-44-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-44""><EM>44</EM></A>, <A id=""xref-ref-45-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-45""><EM>45</EM></A>). The first inventory (T1) included in this study was between 1980 and 1995 and varied by state. The second inventory (T2) was the latest completed inventory, which was finished in 2015 for most states. The time period between the two intervals ranged from 20 to 35 years, with an average of 29.5 years (table S4).</P><P id=""p-34"">Across the study area, a total of 201 species/groups were recorded during T1, and 240 were recorded during T2. To account for the variations of sampling protocols between the two inventory periods, we first applied a set of selection criteria (Supplementary Text), which resulted in a total of 86 species/groups in our analysis (table S5). Because a significant portion of the plots were measured during only one of the two inventory periods, we aggregated plot-level abundance data to the hexagon level (a spatial tessellation design used by FIA). A total of 2747 hexagons of 1452 km<SUP>2</SUP> in area, approximately the mean size of eastern counties, were used as the unit of analysis in our study. Total number of stems in a hexagon (stems/ha × total forested area) was used to measure species abundance within each hexagon for saplings [defined as &lt;12.7 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh)] (<A id=""xref-ref-24-4"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-24""><EM>24</EM></A>), for adult trees (&gt;12.7 cm in dbh), and for all trees by species.</P><P id=""p-35"">To investigate how species abundances shifted between the two inventories, we used the shift distance and direction of the geographic center weighted by species abundance (Supplementary Text). We conducted a total of 10,000 random permutations per species to test whether the observed shift was statistically significant (Supplementary Text). Rose diagrams were generated in the R circular package (<A id=""xref-ref-46-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-46""><EM>46</EM></A>) to illustrate the overall pattern of abundance shift of both direction and distance for all species studied. To understand whether the observed spatial shift is due to the changes in leading or trailing edges, we first subdivided each species distribution range into four cardinal quadrants on the basis of its abundance center at T1. We then calculated and compared the shift distances and density changes for subpopulations within each quadrant. To avoid sampling biases, only species with sufficient sample sizes (≥30 hexagons and ≥300 plots) at either T1 or T2 for each subpopulation were included in this analysis. A Tukey post hoc test was applied to test whether the shifts among subpopulations in each quadrant were statistically different.</P><P id=""p-36"">We then analyzed the relationship between the observed species shifts in relation to <mark>climate</mark> variables and forest succession status. For <mark>climate</mark> variables, we first calculated MAT, TAP, and mean PDSI in the recent past (1951–1980) and during the study period (1981–2015). MAT and TAP were calculated using the 4-km spatial resolution <mark>climate</mark> data from the PRISM <mark>Climate</mark> Group (<A href=""http://prism.oregonstate.edu/"">http://prism.oregonstate.edu/</A>), and PDSI data were obtained from the WestWide Drought Tracker (<A href=""http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/wwdt/"">www.wrcc.dri.edu/wwdt/</A>), which also had a spatial resolution of 4 km. These <mark>climate</mark> variables were then aggregated at the hexagon level for each period. We used stem density and basal area for all trees regardless of species as indicators of successional status at T1 and T2 for each hexagon. In general, overall stem density decreases whereas basal area increases as forest progresses from early to late successional stages. Next, we calculated relative changes in mean stem density between the two inventories by species, and we calculated relative changes between T1 and T2 in total stem density and basal area for all trees and changes over time in mean MAT, TAP, and PDSI within each species’ overlapped distribution range at T1 and T2 (that is, only with hexagons that contain the target species at both T1 and T2). A multiple linear regression with a mixed-effects model was performed to test the association among changes in species-level mean stem density and changes in MAT, TAP, PDSI, total stem density, and total basal area.</P><P id=""p-37"">To test whether the observed spatial shifts are trait-specific, we first constructed a database with two functional trait groups (table S3). The first group encompassed traits associated with trees’ ability to migrate, including seed weight, dispersal mechanism, and rate of spread. The second group encompassed traits associated with trees’ physiological tolerances, including temperature, precipitation, fire, shade, and drought tolerances. Because of the lack of actual precipitation and temperature tolerance data, we used minimum temperature, minimum precipitation, and maximum precipitation from species-specific realized climatic niche as surrogates in our study (see table S3 for variable definition and data sources). We compared species traits among four classes: significant westward or northward shift, nonsignificant westward or northward shift, nonsignificant east or southward shift, and significant eastward or southward shift. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used for traits with continuous variables, and a χ<SUP>2</SUP> test was used for traits with categorical variables due to the non-normality of the data. Additionally, a Kruskal-Wallis test for differences in latitudinal and longitudinal shift rates was used for categorical plant traits.</P><P id=""p-38"">We investigated the degree to which longitudinal and latitudinal shifts were associated with the evolutionary relatedness of tree species by displaying these shifts on a phylogenetic supertree encompassing the 86 species in the study and by testing for phylogenetic signal in these shifts. The phylogenetic supertree was pruned from one generated for 397 native tree species occurring throughout the forests of the contiguous 48 states and inventoried by FIA, as described by Potter and Woodall (<A id=""xref-ref-47-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-47""><EM>47</EM></A>). We used the R package phytools (<A id=""xref-ref-48-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-48""><EM>48</EM></A>) to display each species’ longitudinal and latitudinal shifts (across all life stages) on the phylogenetic tree, with trees in the aforementioned four classes. We then used the R package picante (<A id=""xref-ref-49-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-49""><EM>49</EM></A>) to test the degree to which the tree species phylogeny predicts the ecological similarity of the species with respect to these shifts. Specifically, we generated the <EM>K</EM> statistic, which compares the observed phylogenetic signal in a trait (in this case, the longitudinal or latitudinal shift) to the signal under a Brownian motion model of trait evolution on a phylogeny (<A id=""xref-ref-50-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-50""><EM>50</EM></A>), and then assessed the statistical significance of the phylogenetic signal by comparing observed patterns of the variance of independent contrasts of each trait to a null model of shuffled taxon labels across the tips of the phylogeny.</P></DIV><DIV class=""section app"" id=""app-1""><H2 class="""">SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS</H2><DIV id=""DC1"" class=""supplementary-material""><P id=""p-39"">Supplementary material for this article is available at <A href=""http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/3/5/e1603055/DC1"">http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/3/5/e1603055/DC1</A></P><P id=""p-40"">Supplementary Text</P><P id=""p-41"">fig.

NCEI is frequently called upon to provide summaries of global and U.S. temperature and precipitation trends, extremes, and comparisons in their historical perspective. Found here are the weather and <mark>climate</mark> events that have had the greatest economic impact from 1980 to 2018. The U.S. has sustained 230 weather and <mark>climate</mark> disasters since 1980 where overall damages/costs reached or exceeded $1 billion (including CPI adjustment to 2018). <STRONG>The total cost of these 230 events exceeds $1.5 trillion</STRONG>.</P><H2>2018 in Progress…</H2><P>In 2018 (as of April 6), there have been 3 weather and <mark>climate</mark> disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each across the United States. These events included 1 severe storm event and 2 winter storm events. Overall, these events  resulted in the deaths of 34 people and had significant economic effects on the areas impacted. The 1980–2017 annual average is 6.0 events (CPI-adjusted); the annual average for the most recent 5 years (2013–2017) is 11.6 events (CPI-adjusted).
</P><P>During 2017, the U.S. experienced a historic year of weather and <mark>climate</mark> disasters. In total, the U.S. was impacted by 16 separate billion-dollar disaster events tying 2011 for the record number of billion-dollar disasters for an entire calendar year. In fact, 2017 arguably has more events than 2011 given that our analysis traditionally counts all U.S. billion-dollar wildfires, as regional-scale, seasonal events, not as multiple isolated events.</P><P>More notable than the high frequency of these events was the cumulative cost, which <STRONG>exceeded $300 billion in 2017</STRONG>—<SPAN style=""text-decoration:underline;"">a new U.S. annual record</SPAN>.

NCEI held a workshop with economic experts (May, 2012) and worked with a consulting partner to examine possible inaccuracy and biases in the data sources and methodology used in developing the loss assessments (mid-2013). This ensures more consistency with the numbers NCEI provides on a yearly basis and give more confidence in the year-to-year comparison of information. Another outcome is a published peer-reviewed article <A href=""/monitoring-content/billions/docs/smith-and-katz-2013.pdf"">&quot;U.S. Billion-dollar Weather and <mark>Climate</mark> Disasters: Data Sources, Trends, Accuracy and Biases&quot; (Smith and Katz, 2013)</A>. This research found the net effect of all biases appears to be an underestimation of average loss. In particular, it is shown that the factor approach can result in an underestimation of average loss of approximately 10–15%. This bias was corrected during a reanalysis of the loss data to reflect new loss totals.</P><P>It is also known that the uncertainty of loss estimates differ by disaster event type reflecting the quality and completeness of the data sources used in our loss estimation. In 2017, seven of the sixteen billion-dollar events (i.e., the 2 inland flooding events, drought, freeze and hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria) have higher potential uncertainty values around the loss estimates due to less coverage of insured assets and data latency. The remaining nine events (i.e., the 8 severe storm events and wildfire) have lower potential uncertainty surrounding their estimate due to more complete insurance coverage and data availability. Our newest research defines the cost uncertainty using confidence intervals as discussed in the peer-reviewed article <A href=""/monitoring-content/billions/docs/smith-and-matthews-2015.pdf"">&quot;Quantifying Uncertainty and Variable Sensitivity within the U.S. Billion-dollar Weather and <mark>Climate</mark> Disaster Cost Estimates&quot; (Smith and Matthews, 2015)</A>. This research is a next step to enhance the value and usability of estimated disaster costs given data limitations and inherent complexities.</P><P>In performing these disaster cost assessments these statistics were taken from a wide variety of sources and represent, to the best of our ability, the estimated total costs of these events -- that is, the costs in terms of dollars that would not have been incurred had the event not taken place. Insured and uninsured losses are included in damage estimates. Sources include the National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Interagency Fire Center, U.S. Army Corps, individual state emergency management agencies, state and regional <mark>climate</mark> centers, media reports, and insurance industry estimates.

Pyrolysis processes are classified into two major types, fast and slow, which refer to the speed at which the biomass is altered. Fast pyrolysis, with biomass residence times of a few seconds at most, generates more bio-oil and less biochar than slow pyrolysis, for which biomass residence times can range from hours to days.</P><P>The <mark>sustainable</mark>-biochar concept is summarized in <A href=""#f1"" data-track=""click"" data-track-action=""figure anchor"" data-track-label=""link"">Figure 1</A>. CO<SUB>2</SUB> is removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis. Sustainably procured crop residues, manures, biomass crops, timber and forestry residues, and green waste are pyrolysed by modern technology to yield bio-oil, syngas, process heat and biochar. As a result of pyrolysis, immediate decay of these biomass inputs is avoided. The outputs of the pyrolysis process serve to provide energy, avoid emissions of GHGs such as methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>) and nitrous oxide (N<SUB>2</SUB>O), and amend agricultural soils and pastures. The bioenergy is used to offset fossil-fuel emissions, while returning about half of the C fixed by photosynthesis to the atmosphere. In addition to the GHG emissions avoided by preventing decay of biomass inputs, soil emissions of GHGs are also decreased by biochar amendment to soils. The biochar stores <mark>carbon</mark> in a recalcitrant form that can increase soil water- and nutrient-holding capacities, which typically result in increased plant growth. This enhanced productivity is a positive feedback that further enhances the amount of CO<SUB>2</SUB> removed from the atmosphere. Slow decay of biochar in soils, together with tillage and transport activities, also returns a small amount of CO<SUB>2</SUB> to the atmosphere.

This model includes the effects of feedstock procurement, transport, pyrolysis, energy production, soil incorporation, soil GHG flux, soil fertility and fertilizer use (see also <A href=""/articles/ncomms1053#s1"" data-track=""click"" data-track-action=""supplementary material anchor"" data-track-label=""link"">Supplementary Table S13</A>), and biomass and biochar decomposition (see also <A href=""/articles/ncomms1053#s1"" data-track=""click"" data-track-action=""supplementary material anchor"" data-track-label=""link"">Supplementary Fig. S11</A>). The net avoided GHG emissions due to biochar were calculated as the difference between the CO<SUB>2</SUB>-equivalent emissions from biochar production and those that would have occurred as the biomass decomposed by other means had it not been converted to biochar. All emissions (actual or avoided) were calculated with time dependency. Wherever possible, conservative assumptions were used to provide a high degree of confidence that our results represent a conservative estimate of the avoided GHG emissions achievable in each scenario.

                <mark>CO2</mark> emissions from electricity and heat production, total (million metric tons). <mark>CO2</mark> emissions from electricity and heat production is the sum of three IEA categories of <mark>CO2</mark> emissions: (1) Main Activity Producer Electricity and Heat which contains the sum of emissions from main activity producer electricity generation, combined heat and power generation and heat plants. Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the <mark>CO2</mark> emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and &quot;other&quot; sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.

One of the most common sceptical arguments against human-caused <mark>climate change</mark> is that changes in solar activity, rather than just <mark>CO2</mark>, is playing the biggest role.</P><P>At first glance, it seems to make intuitive sense: the sun is a massive nuclear fusion reactor a million times larger than Earth, it is responsible for almost all the energy reaching our planet, and in the past few decades scientists have learned that solar activity varies significantly over time. Indeed, changes in the distribution of sunlight reaching the Earth clearly change the temperature dramatically on a daily and annual timescale.</P><P>However, since 1970 global temperatures have shot up by almost 0.7 C, while the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth has actually declined. Similarly, the upper atmosphere is cooling while the lower atmosphere warms, a clear fingerprint of warming from greenhouse gases rather than the sun.</P><P>This evidence suggests we can rule out a major solar influence on recent warming.</P><H4>Moving in opposite directions</H4><P>Satellites have been directly monitoring the amount of the sun’s energy reaching the Earth since the late 1970s. Before that, researchers kept careful records of the number of “sunspots”, dark patches on the surface of the sun that are strongly related to solar output.</P><P>Combining older sunspot measurements with modern satellite observations, scientists have put together estimates of the sun’s output – called Total Solar Irradiance, or TSI – for the past 400 years. There is still some debate around how much solar output changed in the past, with some reconstructions suggesting <A href=""http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/sorce/data/tsi-data/#data_files"">more variation</A> than <A href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7767415"">others</A>.</P><P>The plot below shows the solar TSI reconstruction from Naval Research Laboratory Total Solar Irradiance-2 (NRLTSI2) <A href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.05397.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">model (red line)</A> – one of the ones with larger changes in solar output over the past 150 years – alongside the <A href=""http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut4/"">surface temperature record</A> jointly produced by  the UK Met Office Hadley Centre and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (black line).</P>

<P>The temperature and TSI values shown in this plot are not intended to be directly comparable. <A href=""https://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/gschmidt/"">Dr Gavin Schmidt</A>, director of NASA Goddard Institute of Space Studies, tells <mark>Carbon</mark> Brief that it would take around a seven watts per metre squared change in TSI to result in 1C warming, meaning that the observed rise in solar activity between 1880 and 1980 would result in only 0.1C warming.</P><P>There are indirect effects that need to be accounted for as well. Increases in solar UV output increase the formation of ozone, which is itself a greenhouse gas. This could at most double solar’s contribution to warming, taking it to 0.2C.</P><P>This shows that solar has only had a small impact of global temperatures over the last century or so, says Schmidt:</P><P class=""quote"">“Just as for the other drivers of change (such as deforestation, air <mark>pollution</mark> and greenhouse gases) we can calculate the fingerprint for these variations in time throughout the <mark>climate</mark> system from the surface to the mesosphere [in the upper atmosphere]. When we match that up with what we have observed over time though, the solar contribution is small –- close to zero over the last 50 years, and perhaps as large as 10% since the late 19th century.”</P><H4>A slight decrease in solar activity</H4><P>It is also worth noting that almost all of the minor warming contribution from fluctuations in the sun’s output occurred before 1970.</P><P>In recent decades, when global temperatures have risen most steeply, TSI has been flat or even slightly declining, says Schmidt:</P><P class=""quote"">“The period of greatest warming – since about 1975 – has coincided with a slight decrease in solar activity.”</P><P>Solar output in the satellite era, when we have much higher confidence in the records, is shown in the figure below. Each black dot represents daily total solar irradiance, while the red line is a longer-term average.</P>

Red line represents a lowess-smoothed fit. Chart by <mark>Carbon</mark> Brief using <A href=""https://www.highcharts.com/"">Highcharts</A>.
<P>There is a clear cycle in solar activity of around 11 years. This has some effect on short-term <mark>climate</mark>, though it tends to average out over longer time periods. For example, the unusually low solar output in after 2009 may <A href=""https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v545/n7652/full/nature22315.html"">have contributed</A> to slower warming of the Earth’s surface between 1998 and 2013.</P><H4>Atmospheric ‘fingerprint’</H4><P>The lack of an increase in solar activity after 1970 is one major argument against a solar role in modern warming. Another is the cooling in a layer of the upper atmosphere known as  the stratosphere.</P><P>If changing solar output were driving warming, the whole atmosphere would warm due to the addition of incoming solar radiation. In contrast, if warming was due to greenhouse gases, the lowest layer of the atmosphere – the troposphere – and surface would warm, while the upper atmosphere would cool as greenhouse gases trapped heat and prevented it from escaping the troposphere.</P><P>The figure below shows what has actually happened since 1950. The upper chart shows a clear cooling trend in the stratosphere, while the lower chart shows the warming of the troposphere and Earth’s surface. This is the “fingerprint” of warming from <mark>CO2</mark> and other greenhouse gases, though recent declines in stratospheric ozone also play a large role in stratospheric cooling.</P><DIV id=""attachment_27366"" style=""width: 1034px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Global lower stratosphere (top) and troposphere (bottom) temperatures between 1958 and 2012.

But it hasn’t been – it has been cooling, exactly as predicted from the effects of <mark>CO2</mark> increases.”</P><H4>Grasping at cosmic rays</H4><P>With no discernable increase in solar activity, proponents of solar influence on modern warming have turned to other possible explanations. One that has <A href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1542332/Cosmic-rays-blamed-for-global-warming.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">gained traction</A> in recent years is the idea that galactic cosmic rays may play a role in the Earth’s <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are high energy particles from beyond our solar system that regularly bombard the Earth. When solar activity is high, the “solar wind” – a stream of particles emitted from the sun – acts to reduce the number of GCRs that enter the Earth’s atmosphere.</P><P>Some research has found that GCRs in the atmosphere can play a role in cloud formation, with higher levels of GCRs potentially leading to more low-altitude clouds. These low-altitude clouds can influence the Earth’s <mark>climate</mark> by reflecting incoming sunlight back into space.</P><P>This has <A href=""https://www.europhysicsnews.org/articles/epn/pdf/2015/02/epn2015462p26.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">led some to suggest</A> that changes in solar activity could influence the Earth’s <mark>climate</mark> by changing cloud formation.</P><P>However, the GCR hypothesis suffers from the <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3253.full"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">same fundamental problem</A> as total solar irradiance: it is moving in the wrong direction. Since 1960, the amount of GCRs reaching the Earth has increased, as shown in the figure below. If GCRs were a major influence on <mark>climate</mark>, this would result in cooling, not warming, over the past 50 years.</P>

As he concludes for <mark>Carbon</mark> Brief:</A></P><P class=""quote"">“Most-importantly, the observed height profile is all wrong: a total solar irradiance increase would drive higher temperatures at all heights in the atmosphere, not just the surface, whereas the data show that while the lower atmosphere (and surface) have warmed, the stratosphere has cooled.

Future <mark>climate change</mark> will further impact water quality in both direct and indirect ways by influencing the hydrological cycle and processes of nutrient transportation and transformation, but studies are still rare. This study focuses on quantifying the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on nutrient (Nitrogen and Phosphorus) losses from the two small watersheds (Walworth watershed and Green Lake watershed) within the Great Lakes region. Analysis focused on changes through this century (comparing the nutrient loss prediction of three future periods from 2015 to 2099 with 30 years for each period against the historical nutrient estimation data from 1985 to 2008). The effects on total phosphorus and nitrate-nitrogen losses due to changes in precipitation quantity, intensity, and frequency, as well as air temperature, are evaluated for the two small watersheds, under three special report emission scenarios (SRES A2, A1B, B1). The newly developed Water Erosion Prediction Project-Water Quality (WEPP-WQ) model is utilized to simulate nutrient losses with downscaled and bias corrected future <mark>climate</mark> forcing from two General Circulation Models (GFDL, HadCM3). For each watershed, the observed runoff and nutrient loads are used to calibrate and validate the model before the application of the WEPP-WQ model to examine potential impacts from future <mark>climate change</mark>. Total phosphorus loss is projected to increase by 28% to 89% for the Green Lake watershed and 25% to 108% for the Walworth watershed mainly due to the combined effects of increase of precipitation quantity, extreme storm events in intensity and frequency, and air temperature. Nitrate-nitrogen losses are projected to increase by 1.1% to 38% for the Green Lake watershed and 8% to 95% for the Walworth watershed with the different major influencing factors in each future periods.

Earth's <mark>climate</mark> system, it is obvious that solar variations have
the potential to directly alter <mark>climate</mark>. Changes in insolation on a
variety of time scales have been suggested as causes of known
<mark>climate change</mark>, from the (Milankovitch) orbital cycles of thousands
of years (Hays et al., 1976), to the decadal-to-century scale
fluctuations typified by the Little Ice Age (Eddy, 1976). During
the next 50 to 100 years, the Earth's <mark>climate</mark> is expected to warm
by anywhere from 1.5° to 4.5°C in response to increasing
concentrations of greenhouse gases: <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (CO<SPAN class=""Subscript"">2</SPAN>); methane (CH<SPAN class=""Subscript"">4</SPAN>); nitrous oxide (N<SPAN class=""Subscript"">2</SPAN>O); chlorofluoro<mark>carbon</mark>s (CFCs)
(Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, 1992). If solar
irradiance were to vary over the next century, natural <mark>climate</mark>
change might also result. Nevertheless, until recently there has
been no proof that variations in the Sun's output do in fact occur
(as evidenced by the term solar &quot;constant&quot;, which is still in
widespread use).</P><P>Observations of total solar irradiance by spacecraft radiometers
(Willson and Hudson, 1991; Hoyt et al., 1992) have now detected
decadal variations on the order of 0.1 percent in apparent
association with the Sun's 11-year activity cycle (Figure 2.1);
larger variations, of the order of a few tenths percent, occur on
shorter time scales and are associated with the Sun's 27-day

since at longer wavelengths the measurement uncertainties
significantly exceed the amplitudes of the solar variations, which
are thought to be less than 1 percent. Measurements of total

experiments flown on spacecraft (to overcome the atmospheric
effects) has succeeded in measuring solar irradiance variability on
the time scales of the Sun's 11-year activity cycle.</P><P>Launched in late 1978, and operational until 1993, the Earth
Radiation Budget (ERB) experiment on the Nimbus 7 spacecraft has
provided the longest solar irradiance data base (Hickey et al.,
1988; Hoyt et al., 1992), although its record (Figure 2.1) is
limited by the constraint that the top priority for the Nimbus
7/ERB platform was nadir-looking Earth observations, with only a
few minutes per orbit of solar observational opportunity.
Coincident with the ERB measurements over most of its lifetime are
measurements made by the Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance
Monitor (ACRIM I), launched on the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) in
early 1980 (Willson et al., 1981; Willson, 1984; Willson and
Hudson, 1991). This experiment was specifically designed for, and
dedicated to, long term, high precision solar total irradiance
monitoring; it ceased operation in October 1989 when the SMM
spacecraft reentered the Earth's atmosphere.</P><P>The Nimbus 7/ERB and ACRIM I results provided the first
unequivocal proof of intrinsic total solar irradiance variability,
and variations have since been detected on every observable time
scale (Figure 2.1). ACRIM's high precision is attributable to its
active, electrically self-calibrating cavity (ESCC) solar
pyrheliometers and its full-time solar pointing, which provided
large numbers of observations. Solar variations measured by ACRIM
have been corroborated by the ERB data, with the agreement between
the two independent data sets improved by accounting for
temperature dependent calibration errors and solar pointing
limitations in ERB (Hoyt et al., 1992).</P><P>The successor experiments to the Nimbus 7/ERB were the Earth
Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) and the Earth Radiation Budget
Experiment (ERBE) on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA)-9 satellite (Lee III, 1990; Lee III et al.,
1994). The use of an active cavity ESCC mode for solar observations
has improved the quality of the data, but there are operational
constraints on solar viewing similar to those with Nimbus 7/ERB,
with even less frequent data acquisition opportunities. These
latter instruments operate only about every second week and

minimum period and an increase with the increasing solar activity
of solar cycle 22. Differences do exist among the different
irradiance data bases in the rate of decrease in cycle 21, the
actual occurrence of minimum activity, and the rate of increase in
cycle 22. These differences are possibly the result of uncorrected
sensor degradation.</P><P>In September 1991, ACRIM II was launched on the Upper Atmosphere
Research Satellite (UARS). Preliminary data (Figure 2.1) indicate
that the UARS/ACRIM II irradiance measurements are systematically
lower by about 2 W/m <SPAN class=""Superscript"">2</SPAN> than those
of SMM/ACRIM I, whereas Nimbus 7/ERB data indicate solar variations
of only a few hundredths of a percent. It would have been
preferable to overlap the SMM/ACRIM I and UARS/ACRIM II experiments
to provide direct cross-calibration, but the UARS launch delay made
this impossible. Thus to preserve the continuity of the ACRIM solar
irradiance data base, a third party comparison between ACRIM I and
ACRIM II is needed, using the Nimbus 7/ERB or ERBE/ERBS
experiments. In the latter case, given the infrequent ERBE/ERBS
solar observations, the standard error is estimated to be some 30
times larger than a direct ACRIM I/II comparison.</P><P>The data shown in Figure 2.1 indicate that the average solar
irradiance declined systematically from 1980 until mid-1986 at a
mean rate of 0.015 percent per year. The irradiance minimum in 1986
occurs near the activity cycle minimum of September 1986 (as
indicated by the sunspot number data in Figure 2.1). The subsequent
rapid increase, corresponding to the buildup of solar activity in
solar cycle 22, becomes clearly visible in 1988, continuing to the
cycle 22 maximum. Declining values in the latter half of 1992
herald the approach of the next solar activity minimum, expected in
1995–1996. Taken together, the solar radiometer data indicate
that the amplitude of the recent 11-year irradiance cycle is about
0.1 percent, disregarding the high Nimbus 7/ERB values in the early
years of that record, where the uncertainties are large because of
the need to remove significant instrumental effects from the
measurements (see Hoyt et al., 1992).</P><P>While the ACRIM I, Nimbus 7/ERB, ERBS, and ERBE sensors indeed
show similar solar cycle variations of about 0.1 percent (aside
from the high Nimbus 7/ERB data in 1978–1979), their absolute
solar irradiance values range over some 6 W/m<SPAN class=""Superscript"">2</SPAN>, due to absolute calibration
uncertainties.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""page"" data-page=""29"" data-display=""29"" data-format=""html""><DIV class=""page-tools""><DIV class=""page-tools-inner""><SPAN class=""page-number"">Page 29 </SPAN><SPAN class=""page-actions""><SPAN class=""page-actions-inner""><A href=""#"" class=""page-action share addthis_button"" title=""Share this page"" addthis:url=""http://www.nap.edu/read/4778/page/29"" id=""atic""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Share</SPAN></A><A href=""#"" class=""page-action cite"" title=""Cite this page""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Cite</SPAN></A></SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""page-tools-panel""><DIV class=""panel-citation""><STRONG>Suggested Citation:</STRONG>&quot;2   SOLAR VARIATIONS AND <mark>CLIMATE CHANGE</mark>.&quot; National Research Council.  1994. <EM>Solar Influences on Global Change</EM>.

measurements, which are typically ± 0.2 percent or larger
(Willson, 1984; Luther et al., 1986), are more than twice the
downward trend seen from 1980 to 1985. That the uncertainties in
measurements made by state-of-the-art solar radiometers are
significantly larger than their long term precision, and than the
changes caused by solar variability, has important consequences for
the continuation of the irradiance data base. In the absence of a
third party comparison between ACRIM I and ACRIM II, a decade of
solar monitoring would have been terminated, since the solar
radiometers lack the accuracies to measure real solar changes
smaller than a few tenths percent, twice the 11-year irradiance
cycle.</P><P>Instruments such as ACRIM and ERB record the variation in the
total electromagnetic energy from the Sun without identifying the
wavelengths of the radiation at which the variations are occurring.
About 99 percent of the total solar irradiance signal is from
radiation at wavelengths longer than 300 nm, radiation that
penetrates to the troposphere and the Earth's surface. However,
shorter wavelength, more variable solar UV radiation (Figure 1.1),
which is absorbed primarily above the trophosphere (Figure 1.2),
contributed approximately 20 percent of the decline in the total
solar irradiance from mid-1981 to 1985 (Lean, 1989). It is not
known whether the entire solar spectrum varies in phase with solar
activity, or how energy might be redistributed within the spectrum.
Percentage variations at longer wavelengths are expected to be much
smaller than those at UV wavelengths, on the order of a few tenths
percent and not necessarily in phase with the activity cycle
(Figure 1.1). However, these longer wavelength spectral irradiance
variations have yet to be observationally defined.</P><H5 class=""Heading-Heading4"">Implications from Observations of
Solar Surrogates</H5><P>The direct correlation of solar radiative output with solar
activity over the 11-year solar cycle is a major discovery from the
ACRIM and ERB long term solar monitoring programs. Variations in
total solar irradiance occur continuously, on time scales of days
to months, in response to episodes of activity throughout the
11-year solar cycle and the modulation of active region emission by
the Sun's 27-day rotation. These variations reflect the
inhomogeneous emission of radiation on the solar disk. Solar
radiation is depleted in active region sunspots and enhanced in

and Lean, 1986; Chapman et al., 1986). From the minimum to the
maximum of the 11-year activity cycle there is an increase in
active regions, both sunspots and faculae, on the solar disk. Total
solar irradiance is thought to be positively correlated with the
11-year solar activity cycle because excess facular brightness,
especially from the background active network of bright emission
outside of the largest active regions, more than compensates for
the sunspot deficit (Foukal and Lean, 1988; Willson and Hudson,
1991). Global perturbations in temperature and/ or diameter may
also be occuring (Kuhn et al., 1989; Ribes et al., 1989; Kuhn and
Libbrecht, 1991; Sofia and Fox, 1994).</P><P>To understand the forcing of the <mark>climate</mark> system by solar
irradiance changes, it is necessary to have empirical models
capable of extrapolating the radiative output variations to epochs
beyond present solar cycles. Knowing that total solar irradiance is
enhanced at times of maximum activity, and that these variations
appear to arise from the competing effects of two different types
of active regions (dark sunspots and bright faculae), suggests that
past variations may be reconstructed from historical indicators of
solar activity. Empirical parameterizations have been developed to
investigate this possibility. The most successful models (Chapter
6) are based on regressions between the ACRIM I or ERB results
(corrected for sunspot effects) with specific solar activity
indices (derived from the solar He I 1083 nm, Ca II 393.4 nm, and H
I 121.6 nm lines) that are considered better surrogates for the
total irradiance brightness source than are the classical solar
activity indicators, the Zü rich sunspot number and the 10.7
cm radio flux (Foukal and Lean, 1988; Livingston et al., 1988).</P><P>Many of the major features of the irradiance data have been
reproduced by a regression model using the equivalent width (EW) of
the solar He I line; these models do not reproduce the high levels
of irradiance measured by the radiometers in 1979– 1980 near
the maximum of solar cycle 21. Also , there are inconsistencies
between the Nimbus 7/ERB measurements and model around the time of
the cycle 22 activity maximum. Either the empirical relationships
differ between solar minimum and solar maximum, and perhaps from
one solar cycle to the next, or the irradiance observations are too
high because of instrumental artifacts.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""page"" data-page=""31"" data-display=""31"" data-format=""html""><DIV class=""page-tools""><DIV class=""page-tools-inner""><SPAN class=""page-number"">Page 31 </SPAN><SPAN class=""page-actions""><SPAN class=""page-actions-inner""><A href=""#"" class=""page-action share addthis_button"" title=""Share this page"" addthis:url=""http://www.nap.edu/read/4778/page/31"" id=""atic""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Share</SPAN></A><A href=""#"" class=""page-action cite"" title=""Cite this page""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Cite</SPAN></A></SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""page-tools-panel""><DIV class=""panel-citation""><STRONG>Suggested Citation:</STRONG>&quot;2   SOLAR VARIATIONS AND <mark>CLIMATE CHANGE</mark>.&quot; National Research Council.  1994. <EM>Solar Influences on Global Change</EM>.

developed from the extant spacecraft data are extrapolated over the
past century, the long term variations arising from magnetic
sunspot and faculae features alone have been no greater than 0.1
percent (Foukal and Lean, 1990). However, as discussed below,
limits of solar variability, such as inferred from observations of
Sun-like stars, provide circumstantial evidence for a brightness
component that has been slowly increasing the total solar
irradiance since the Maunder Minimum, a time of reduced solar
activity from about 1645 to 1715. With changes in this additional
brightness component superimposed on the 11-year cycle variations,
a reduction of 0.24 percent is estimated for the Maunder Minimum,
relative to the mean of the contemporary 11-year irradiance cycle
(Lean et al., 1992a).</P><P>Solar observations made by telescopes in the seventeenth century
also suggest increased solar diameter and equatorial surface
rotation during the Maunder Minimum, compared with the modern Sun
(Eddy et al., 1976; Nesme-Ribes et al., 1993). Using apparent solar
radius as a surrogate for solar irradiance leads to speculation of
a reduction as large as 1 percent during the late seventeenth
century (Nesme-Ribes et al., 1993). In addition to uncertainties
about the amplitude of solar irradiance values in the Maunder
Minimum, there are also differences in reconstructions of the
relative temporal variations in the irradiance since then -- over
the past 300 years. While derivations based on different solar
surrogates -- such as the apparent solar radius record, the length
of the sunspot cycle, the sunspot decay rate, or the mean activity
level of the 11-year cycle -- do agree about the overall increasing
levels of solar activity during the past 300 years, phase
differences in specific episodic increases and decreases of
activity may be as large as 20 years (Hoyt and Schatten, 1993).</P><H5 class=""Heading-Heading4"">Geophysical Proxies</H5><P>Relatively continuous, direct records of solar activity exist

Damon, 1991), even though the physical connections between the
proxies and solar activity the indirect. For example the <SPAN class=""Superscript"">14</SPAN> C record is connected to solar
activity as follows. Changes in the solar wind in response to solar
activity variations modulate the heliospheric magnetic topology.
During times of minimum solar activity, cosmic rays are swept out
of the heliosphere less effectively by the solar wind than during
maximum solar activity. Thus at solar minima an increased flux of
galactic cosmic rays reaches the Earth's atmosphere. This leads to
increased production of <SPAN class=""Superscript"">14</SPAN> C,
which accumulates in the biosphere where it is available for uptake
by trees. The similarity between the recent <SPAN class=""Superscript"">14</SPAN> C record and the envelope of the
sunspot record of solar activity is evident in Figure 1.3. Although
many uncertainties exist in interpreting such phenomena, these
records offer the potential for gaining improved understanding of
solar behavior in the extended past, relevant to global change
issues (Wigley and Kelly, 1990; Damon and Sonett, 1991).</P><H5 class=""Heading-Heading4"">Evidence from Observations of Sun-Like
Stars</H5><P>The sun is a rather common star, and its behavior is thought to
be typified by that of stars of similar age, mass, radius, and
composition. Routine monitoring of the activity of a selection of
Sun-like stars during the past decade has indeed revealed
rotational and activity cycles on time scales similar to those seen
in the Sun (Radick et al., 1990). Also, observations of Ca II
emission in Sun-like stars indicate that 4 out of 13 stars
monitored monthly since 1966 exhibited no activity cycle, implying
that extended periods of inactivity, as exemplified in the modern
solar record by the Maunder Minimum, may be common (Baliunas and
Jastrow, 1990). This conjecture is roughly supported by the
occurrence of minima that punctuate the <SPAN class=""Superscript"">
14</SPAN> C geophysical record of solar activity.</P><P>In the four Sun-like stars observed to be inactive, Ca II
emissions were almost always lower than in the stars that exhibited
activity cycles (Baliunas and Jastrow, 1990). While et al. (1992)
have shown that the Sun's contemporary Ca II emission corresponds
to that of the brighter half of the cycling stars observed by
Baliunas and Jastrow (1990) and does not overlap the range of lower
Ca II emission typical of noncycling stars. Lean et al. (1992a)
investigated the implications of these stellar observations</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""page"" data-page=""33"" data-display=""33"" data-format=""html""><DIV class=""page-tools""><DIV class=""page-tools-inner""><SPAN class=""page-number"">Page 33 </SPAN><SPAN class=""page-actions""><SPAN class=""page-actions-inner""><A href=""#"" class=""page-action share addthis_button"" title=""Share this page"" addthis:url=""http://www.nap.edu/read/4778/page/33"" id=""atic""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Share</SPAN></A><A href=""#"" class=""page-action cite"" title=""Cite this page""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Cite</SPAN></A></SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""page-tools-panel""><DIV class=""panel-citation""><STRONG>Suggested Citation:</STRONG>&quot;2   SOLAR VARIATIONS AND <mark>CLIMATE CHANGE</mark>.&quot; National Research Council.  1994. <EM>Solar Influences on Global Change</EM>.

understanding of the origin of the variations in total solar
irradiance and in the Ca II emission from the Sun and stars. Their
results, shown in Figure 2.3, suggest that during the Sun's Maunder
Minimum the total solar irradiance might have been about 0.24
percent less than its mean value between 1980 and 1990.</P><P>Such a decrease is consistent with inferences about the level of
solar radiative output during the Maunder Minimum reported by
Wigley and Kelly (1990) from the <mark>climate</mark> record, and also with
stellar observations that provide compelling evidence for
variabilities of 0.2 percent to 0.5 percent in the luminosity of
Sun-like stars (Lockwood and Skiff, 1990; Lockwood et al., 1992).
Foukal (1994) notes that the larger luminosity changes observed in
Sun-like stars do not necessarily imply equally larger changes in
the Sun, at least in the present epoch, since these changes are
actually consistent with current understanding of modulation by
photospheric magnetism. Also, the variability amplitudes detected
in stars likely depend on the observer's viewing angle relative to
the stellar spin axis (Schatten, 1993).</P><H5 class=""Heading-Heading4"">Solar Forcing of <mark>Climate Change</mark></H5><P>Variations in solar irradiance may affect the Earth's <mark>climate</mark>

associated directly with the changes in total solar irradiance
measured during the recent solar activity cycle (about 0.1 percent,
see Figure 2.1) is small compared to past <mark>climate</mark> excursions.
Current GCMs estimate that a 2 percent increase in the solar
irradiance would produce about 4°C global warming (Hansen et
al., 1984). Assuming this result is the right order of magnitude,
and that it scales linearly, the 0.1 percent irradiance variation
observed by spaceborne radiometers in solar cycle 21 would produce
an equilibrium temperature change of about 0.2°C. However, the
change from maximum to minimum activity of the 11-year cycle occurs
over about five years, too little time to allow for full
equilibrium response of the <mark>climate</mark> system. Furthermore, where

temperature changes of about 0.2°C were the maximum expected
from solar forcing, it might be concluded that solar forcing could
be safely ignored, relative to a doubling of greenhouse gases, for
which the predicted temperature increase is in the range
1.5°–4.5°C. Yet the <mark>climate</mark> record suggests that
larger effects may have resulted from solar forcing in both the
distant and recent past, and that even today unexpected
sensitivities may exist (e.g., Wigley and Kelly, 1990; Damon and
Sonett, 1991; Labitzke and van Loon, 1993; Thompson et al., 1993).
The challenge of expeditious detection of global warming, well in
advance of the 50 to 100 year time for greenhouse gas doubling,
requires that small (&lt; 1°C) temperature increases be
adequately separated into natural and anthropogenic components.
Furthermore, as a result of the expected cooling by aerosol and
ozone changes, the net anthropogenic <mark>climate</mark> forcing may be only
about half that expected for greenhouse gases alone (Hansen et al.,
1993), making the direct solar influence a potentially larger
component of the net <mark>climate change</mark> signal.</P><P>Solar-induced changes in the stratosphere could have a variety
of indirect influences on the troposphere and <mark>climate</mark> (e.g., NAS,
1982). Investigations with general circulation models (Kodera,
1991; Rind and Balachandran, 1994) suggest that variations in solar
ultraviolet energy input modify the ozone and temperature structure
of the stratosphere, affecting the latitudinal temperature
gradient. This modifies stratospheric wind speeds and the ability
of long-wave energy to propagate out of the troposphere. Altered
tropospheric stability affects various tropospheric dynamic
processes, including the Hadley cell intensity at low and
subtropical latitudes, and low pressure systems in the
extratropics.</P><P>Paleo<mark>climate</mark>, like the recent <mark>climate</mark>, displays numerous
examples of potential interactions between solar radiative forcing
and <mark>climate</mark>. On the longer time scales associated with variations
in the Earth's orbital parameters, the insolation gradient between
low and high latitudes may be modified, or its seasonal variation
changed, which could lead to the growth of ice sheets and altered
ocean circulation patterns. Indeed, ubiquitous in <mark>climate</mark> records
are cycles with periods of about 23,000, 41,000, and 100,000 years
that are widely attributed to variations in the distribution of
insolation with orbital parameters -- the so-called Milankovitch
forcing.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""page"" data-page=""36"" data-display=""36"" data-format=""html""><DIV class=""page-tools""><DIV class=""page-tools-inner""><SPAN class=""page-number"">Page 36 </SPAN><SPAN class=""page-actions""><SPAN class=""page-actions-inner""><A href=""#"" class=""page-action share addthis_button"" title=""Share this page"" addthis:url=""http://www.nap.edu/read/4778/page/36"" id=""atic""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Share</SPAN></A><A href=""#"" class=""page-action cite"" title=""Cite this page""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Cite</SPAN></A></SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""page-tools-panel""><DIV class=""panel-citation""><STRONG>Suggested Citation:</STRONG>&quot;2   SOLAR VARIATIONS AND <mark>CLIMATE CHANGE</mark>.&quot; National Research Council.  1994. <EM>Solar Influences on Global Change</EM>.

discussed below are three times scales associated with different
mechanisms for solar variability: the relatively recent <mark>climate</mark> (a
hundred to a few thousand years), the weather (tens of years), and
orbital variations (many thousands of years).</P><H5 class=""Heading-Heading4"">Solar Irradiance Changes and the
Relatively Recent <mark>Climate</mark></H5><P>There has been much speculation that <mark>climate change</mark>s over the
past few thousand years have been the product of variations in the
Sun's radiative output. Eddy (1976) pointed out the coincidence in
time between the Maunder Minimum of solar activity and the lowest
temperatures of the Little Ice Age in Europe and North America (see
Figure 1.3). He also presented qualitative evidence that other
century-scale variations in <mark>climate</mark> over the past millennium
coincided roughly with variations in solar activity deduced from
anomalies in the <SPAN class=""Superscript"">14</SPAN>C cosmogenic
isotope record. Whereas the long term trend in records of
cosmogenic isotopes such as <SPAN class=""Superscript"">14</SPAN>C
and <SPAN class=""Superscript"">10</SPAN>Be reflects, primarily,
changes in the Earth's magnetic field that affect the interaction
of cosmic rays with the Earth's atmosphere, the wiggles
superimposed on the smooth long term trend are believed to occur
because of the modulation of the local cosmic ray intensity by
magnetic fields embedded in the solar wind, which varies in
response to solar activity (Damon and Sonett, 1991; Beer et al.,
1991; Stuiver and Braziunas, 1993). Thus, enhanced solar activity
corresponds to <SPAN class=""Superscript"">14</SPAN>C minima, and the
mechanism proposed by Eddy for the apparent relationship between
<mark>climate</mark> and the <SPAN class=""Superscript"">14</SPAN>C wiggles
involved changes in the total solar irradiance linked to the long
term envelope of the 11-year sunspot cycle and reflected in the
<SPAN class=""Superscript"">14</SPAN>C record.</P><P>The extent to which cosmogenic isotope variations really
indicate terrestrially relevant variations in solar energy outputs,
either radiative or particle, and the scaling of the relationship
over long times, is poorly known; the paleo<mark>climate</mark> record is
similarly somewhat uncertain (Bradley and Jones, 1993). Although
results are mixed (Wigley and Kelly, 1990; Crowley and Howard,
1990; Damon and Jirikowic, 1994), there is some suggestion of a
relationship; during the past 10,000 years, six of the seven
strongest maxima in the <SPAN class=""Superscript"">14</SPAN>C
wiggles correspond closely to <mark>climate</mark> minima,</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""page"" data-page=""37"" data-display=""37"" data-format=""html""><DIV class=""page-tools""><DIV class=""page-tools-inner""><SPAN class=""page-number"">Page 37 </SPAN><SPAN class=""page-actions""><SPAN class=""page-actions-inner""><A href=""#"" class=""page-action share addthis_button"" title=""Share this page"" addthis:url=""http://www.nap.edu/read/4778/page/37"" id=""atic""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Share</SPAN></A><A href=""#"" class=""page-action cite"" title=""Cite this page""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Cite</SPAN></A></SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""page-tools-panel""><DIV class=""panel-citation""><STRONG>Suggested Citation:</STRONG>&quot;2   SOLAR VARIATIONS AND <mark>CLIMATE CHANGE</mark>.&quot; National Research Council.  1994. <EM>Solar Influences on Global Change</EM>.

identified also in the <SPAN class=""Superscript"">10</SPAN>Be ice
core record.</P><P>Reid (1991) has extended the possible relationship between solar
variability and <mark>climate</mark> parameters down to the decadal time scale
by pointing out the similarity between the record of globally
averaged sea-surface temperature anomalies and the solar cycle
envelope over the past 130 years (Figure 2.4). Accounting for the
observed sea-surface temperature changes in terms of solar forcing
requires a change in solar irradiance of about 0.6 percent. An even
more striking relationship between northern-hemisphere surface
temperatures and the variation of solar cycle length over the past
130 years (Figure 2.4) has been pointed out by Friis-Christensen
and Lassen (1991). The solar cycle envelope and the solar cycle
length are related to each other, and both are indicators of the
long term variability of solar activity (with longer cycles having
smaller amplitudes). The striking correspondence of solar
variability indicators with <mark>climate</mark> parameters provides strong
circumstantial evidence for a physical connection, most probably
through a variation in solar irradiance, but possibly through an
indirect mechanism.</P><P>To attribute changes in <mark>climate</mark> to solar variability, it is
first necessary to estimate the magnitudes of changes in both
<mark>climate</mark> and solar radiation and to show that they are consistent.
Yet the global temperature changes that have accompanied climatic
events during the past millennium are not known in detail. Various
figures have been given for the surface temperature excursions of
this period, ranging from 0.4–0.6°C (Wigley and Kelly,
1990) to 1°–1.5°C (Crowley and North, 1991). To
translate this    temperature change into an
equivalent solar radiative forcing effect requires that the <mark>climate</mark>
sensitivity be known. Using the value associated with current GCMs
of 1°C/(W/m<SPAN class=""Superscript"">2</SPAN>) and assuming
that the duration of the events was sufficiently long (about 100
years) to allow for a full climatic response, accounting for the
entire range of historical <mark>climate</mark> variability requires changes in
total solar irradiance ranging from 0.4 to 1.5 percent. These
variations are larger than those observed by the ACRIM I, Nimbus
7/ERB, and ERBS solar radiometers over the past decade (Figure
2.1).</P><P>It is not known whether changes in Solar irradiance larger than
have been observed in the contemporary Sun are plausible on longer
time scales although estimates of the likely variability of 0.24
percent due to change in sunspots, faculae, and bright magnetic
network radiation on century</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""page"" data-page=""38"" data-display=""38"" data-format=""html""><DIV class=""page-tools""><DIV class=""page-tools-inner""><SPAN class=""page-number"">Page 38 </SPAN><SPAN class=""page-actions""><SPAN class=""page-actions-inner""><A href=""#"" class=""page-action share addthis_button"" title=""Share this page"" addthis:url=""http://www.nap.edu/read/4778/page/38"" id=""atic""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Share</SPAN></A><A href=""#"" class=""page-action cite"" title=""Cite this page""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Cite</SPAN></A></SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""page-tools-panel""><DIV class=""panel-citation""><STRONG>Suggested Citation:</STRONG>&quot;2   SOLAR VARIATIONS AND <mark>CLIMATE CHANGE</mark>.&quot; National Research Council.  1994. <EM>Solar Influences on Global Change</EM>.

2.3) than the 0.4 to 1.5 percent needed to explain the paleo<mark>climate</mark>
record. If the <mark>climate</mark> sensitivity is greater (one inference from
Milankovitch GCM studies; Rind et al., 1989; Phillipps and Held,
1994; discussed below) or the global temperature change smaller
than indicated, the required solar variability would be reduced.
Furthermore, although GCM <mark>climate</mark> simulations estimate a mean
global temperature reduction of 0.46° C for a solar irradiance
reduction of 0.25 percent (Rind and Overpeck, 1993), some regions
of the Earth's surface may cool and others warm by as much as
1° C as a result of advective changes caused by differential
heating of the land and oceans.</P><P>The problem of assessing direct solar radiative forcing of
<mark>climate change</mark> is additionally complicated because the extent to
which total solar irradiance variability arises from radiative
changes at ultraviolet rather than at visible wavelengths (Lean,
1989) determines the altitude of its direct impact on the global
system. If this impact shifts to altitudes mostly above the
troposphere, total solar irradiance forcing of surface temperature
would be reduced. On the other hand, the amplitude of irradiance
variations in the visible and infrared portions of the solar
spectrum that directly heat the surface, though thought to be small
(e.g., Figure 1.1), is not currently known.</P><P>While solar radiative changes are probably not the sole driving
force of the historical <mark>climate</mark> record, they nevertheless will need
to be understood and quantified in order to unravel the
contribution of solar forcing. Indeed, circumstantial evidence
points to a solar forcing contribution to the temperature changes
observed over the past century (Kelly and Wigley, 1992; Schlesinger
and Ramankutty, 1992) that decreases the predicted temperature
change associated with a doubling of atmospheric CO<SPAN class=""Subscript"">2</SPAN> by nearly half (Lacis and Carlson,
1992).</P><P>From the perspective of the U.S. Global Change Research Program,
it is important to know how solar irradiance variations can be
expected to vary in the future and, in particular, the likelihood
that events such as another Little Ice Age, will occur in the
coming century. Were the only variations in solar radiative output
an 11-year cycle with peak-to-peak amplitude of about 0.1 percent,
solar forcing could be expected to modulate the net anthropogenic
<mark>climate</mark> forcing as shown in Figure 2.2. But another scenario is

activity cycle, such as the speculated long term increase in
irradiance from the Maunder Minimum to the present Modern
Maximum.</P><P>Lacking a detailed modeling capability for, and adequate
knowledge of, solar processes on which to base predictions,
researchers have utilized spectral analysis to develop predictive
tools. Phenomena such as sunspot numbers have periodicities on the
order of 100, 55, and 11 years, along with the solar magnetic cycle
of 22 years (e.g., Berger et al., 1990). Ice core records as well
as other climatic data suggest periods of about 80 and 180 years
(Johnsen et al., 1970), possibly related to solar activity (Otaola
and Zenteno, 1983). Extrapolation into the future of two cycles
evident in the <SPAN class=""Superscript"">14</SPAN> C record, at 208
years (the Suess cycle) and 88 years (the Gleissberg cycle),
suggests that the increasing solar activity that has followed the
Maunder Minimum may continue into the early twenty-first century
(Damon and Sonett, 1991), with a decline commencing around 2040.
But extrapolation of these cycles into the future and prediction of
solar effects is a highly questionable procedure, given our lack of
knowledge of the fundamental processes involved (see Chapter
6).</P><P>Wigley and Kelly (1990) have attempted to assess limits on the
role that solar forcing of <mark>climate change</mark> may play, relative to
that of greenhouse gases, during the next 200 years. Analogous to
their approach, and consistent with their results, the predictions
shown in Figure 2.5 indicate that were the Sun to experience a
period of inactivity such as the Maunder Minimum, commencing in the
year 2000, and accompanied by reduction in its radiative output of
0.25 percent, the resultant <mark>climate</mark> forcing would indeed modulate,
but not counter, the predicted anthropogenic <mark>climate</mark> forcing. As
noted previously, determining the actual <mark>climate</mark> impact of the

tropical stratospheric winds (Figure 2.6). The connection between
the TTO and the 11-year solar cycle remains unproven and the
statistical validity of the relationship has been debated (Salby
and Shea, 1991). Nevertheless, the relationship is considered
sufficiently useful to be incorporated in techniques for seasonal
forecasting of U.S. weather (Barnston and Livezey, 1989).</P><P>Other studies have indicated correlations between solar activity
and weather phenomena even when no stratification by QBO phase is
made. For example, the mean latitude of winter storm tracks in the
north Atlantic appears to shift equatorward at times of maximum
solar activity relative to times of activity minima (Tinsley and
Deen, 1991). Periods at 11 and/or 22 years have appeared as
prominent peaks in spectral analyses of the Earth's surface
temperature (Allen and Smith, 1994), sea level pressure (Kelly,
1977), the length of the Atlantic tropical cyclone season (Cohen
and Sweester, 1975), ice accumulation data (Holdsworth et al.,
1989), drought incidence in the western U.S. (Mitchell et al.,
1979), the areal extent of North American forest wildfires
(Auclair, 1992), global northern hemisphere marine temperatures
(Newell et al., 1989), and the separation between annual dust
layers in an ice core from the Guliya Ice Cap (Thompson et al.,
1993).</P><P>However, the basic problem remains: without an understanding of
the physical causal connection, the suspicion will persist that the
results are the product of a posteriori choices (e.g., Baldwin and
Dunkerton, 1989, Salby and Shea, 1991) or are simply the product of
natural internal variability (James and James, 1989). Understanding
the implied relationships between the Sun and the weather, and the
role played by the QBO, would be of enormous benefit, both from the
practical standpoint of seasonal forecasting and by enhancing the
ability to model and deduce the sensitivity of the <mark>climate</mark> system
to a small external perturbation.</P><P>Results of a recent set of GCM studies (Rind and Balachandran,

Variations</H5><P>The study of Hays et al. (1976) showed that the <mark>climate</mark> record
deduced from deep sea sediments varied with periodicities that
generally matched those of the Earth's orbital variations,
specifically variations in eccentricity, obliquity (axial tilt),
and date of perihelion (Figure 2.7). The theory that orbital
variations are indeed the pacemakers of the ice ages has become
widely accepted. However, the theory does have problems, both from
the observational and the modeling perspectives, that are
instructive for evaluating solar influences on global change, and
which must be also addressed by the USGCRP in the broader context
of the Earth System History USGCRP science element.</P><P>The need to understand this issue arises not primarily from the
need to predict future <mark>climate</mark> based on the orbital configurations,
but rather from the standpoint of what it implies about the
sensitivity of the <mark>climate</mark> system, and about the ability of <mark>climate</mark>
models to simulate <mark>climate</mark> sensitivity, since the forcing can be
quantified. The last ice age was presumably initiated during the
time of strongly reduced summer insolation nearly 110,000 years
before the present (BP). The reductions projected for the next
10,000 years are extremely small in comparison and, from this
perspective, another ice age is unlikely in that time frame. This
is illustrated in Figure 2.7.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""page"" data-page=""45"" data-display=""45"" data-format=""html""><DIV class=""page-tools""><DIV class=""page-tools-inner""><SPAN class=""page-number"">Page 45 </SPAN><SPAN class=""page-actions""><SPAN class=""page-actions-inner""><A href=""#"" class=""page-action share addthis_button"" title=""Share this page"" addthis:url=""http://www.nap.edu/read/4778/page/45"" id=""atic""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Share</SPAN></A><A href=""#"" class=""page-action cite"" title=""Cite this page""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Cite</SPAN></A></SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""page-tools-panel""><DIV class=""panel-citation""><STRONG>Suggested Citation:</STRONG>&quot;2   SOLAR VARIATIONS AND <mark>CLIMATE CHANGE</mark>.&quot; National Research Council.  1994. <EM>Solar Influences on Global Change</EM>.

are they the real cause of the glacial/interglacial transitions of
the Pleistocene? Melting of the ice sheets occurred 15,000 to

response is actually associated with orbital forcing.</P><P>Spectral analysis of the paleo<mark>climate</mark> record shows that the
maximum power lies in the approximately 100,000 year period, which
is of the same order as the Earth's eccentricity variation.
However, the changes in eccentricity, on the order of a few tenths
of a percent over the past 5 million years, produce little change
in net annual solar radiation, so that any possible effects on the
seasonal distribution of radiation must be combined with variations
in tilt and precession of the Earth's rotation axis, which are
larger. Thus it is surprising that the about 100,000 year period
dominates in the <mark>climate</mark> record. Examples of this mismatch can
easily be found: the peak of the last ice age, about 20,000 years
BP, coincides with a very weak minimum in Northern Hemisphere
summer solar insolation, and the deglaciation Northern Hemisphere
summer maximum at about 12,000 years BP is no larger than a similar
feature at about 30,000 years BP, which did not lead to complete
deglaciation. These facts suggest that processes other than direct
solar forcing may be responsible for the observed <mark>climate</mark>
record.</P><P>Even the timing of the insolation variations relative to the
climatic response has been questioned. Winograd et al. (1988, 1992)
analyzed the oxygen-18 variations found in a calcitic vein in the
southern Great Basin. The uranium series age dates of the calcite
vein indicated that major glacial/interglacial transitions occurred
some 10,000 to 20,000 years before the solar insolation variations;
for example, the peak interglacial in this record appears at
147,000 ± 3,000 years BP, significantly before the
insolation peak. While the relevance of this local record to global
temperature and precipitation changes may be in doubt, high sea
level stands in the period 135,000 to 140,000 years BP have been
found by various researchers (e.g., Moore, 1982). The absolute
dating capability associated with the calcite vein is in contrast
to the approximate dating techniques associated with the deep sea
paleo<mark>climate</mark> record, where assumptions about sedimentation rates
are fundamental in matching the orbital periodicities.</P><P>When the orbital solar insolation variations are incorporated in
general circulation <mark>climate</mark> models, the temperature changes are not
sufficient to produce ice sheet growth, especially in regions of
low altitude accumulation, as was apparently the case for the
Laurentide ice sheet (Rind et al.,</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""page"" data-page=""47"" data-display=""47"" data-format=""html""><DIV class=""page-tools""><DIV class=""page-tools-inner""><SPAN class=""page-number"">Page 47 </SPAN><SPAN class=""page-actions""><SPAN class=""page-actions-inner""><A href=""#"" class=""page-action share addthis_button"" title=""Share this page"" addthis:url=""http://www.nap.edu/read/4778/page/47"" id=""atic""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Share</SPAN></A><A href=""#"" class=""page-action cite"" title=""Cite this page""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Cite</SPAN></A></SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""page-tools-panel""><DIV class=""panel-citation""><STRONG>Suggested Citation:</STRONG>&quot;2   SOLAR VARIATIONS AND <mark>CLIMATE CHANGE</mark>.&quot; National Research Council.  1994. <EM>Solar Influences on Global Change</EM>.

incomplete or orbitally induced solar insolation variations are at
best only a catalyst for glacial/interglacial changes. Both of

Pyrolysis processes are classified into two major types, fast and slow, which refer to the speed at which the biomass is altered.

CO<SUB>2</SUB> is removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis. Sustainably procured crop residues, manures, biomass crops, timber and forestry residues, and green waste are pyrolysed by modern technology to yield bio-oil, syngas, process heat and biochar. As a result of pyrolysis, immediate decay of these biomass inputs is avoided. The outputs of the pyrolysis process serve to provide energy, avoid emissions of GHGs such as methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>) and nitrous oxide (N<SUB>2</SUB>O), and amend agricultural soils and pastures. The bioenergy is used to offset fossil-fuel emissions, while returning about half of the C fixed by photosynthesis to the atmosphere. In addition to the GHG emissions avoided by preventing decay of biomass inputs, soil emissions of GHGs are also decreased by biochar amendment to soils. The biochar stores <mark>carbon</mark> in a recalcitrant form that can increase soil water- and nutrient-holding capacities, which typically result in increased plant growth. This enhanced productivity is a positive feedback that further enhances the amount of CO<SUB>2</SUB> removed from the atmosphere. Slow decay of biochar in soils, together with tillage and transport activities, also returns a small amount of CO<SUB>2</SUB> to the atmosphere.

Attainment of the MSTP would require substantial alteration to global biomass management, but would not endanger food security, habitat or soil conservation.

Despite these difficulties, recent approximations estimate:</P><UL><LI style=""text-align: justify;"">Tourism is responsible of about 5% of global <mark>CO2</mark> emissions. In terms of radiative forcing, tourism contributes to 4.6% of global warming.1</LI><LI style=""text-align: justify;"">The transport sector, including air, car and rail, generates the largest proportion, with 75% of all emissions. In terms of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, air causes 54-75% while coach and rail 13%. Air travel is considered the main tourism contributor to global warming: It’s responsible for 40% of the total <mark>carbon</mark> emissions caused by this sector, and 54-75 of radiative forcing</LI><LI style=""text-align: justify;"">The accommodation sector accounts for approximately 20% of emissions from tourism. This involves heating, air-conditioning and the maintenance of bars, restaurants, pools and so on. Clearly, this varies according to the location and size of the accommodation, as well as the type of establishments – hotels having greater energy consumption than pensions or camping sites.</LI><LI style=""text-align: justify;"">Furthermore, activities such as museums, theme parks, events or shopping also contribute to certain amounts of emissions (approx. 3.5%). <SPAN style=""font-size:10px;"">1</SPAN></LI></UL><P style=""text-align: justify;""><SPAN style=""font-size:10px;"">1. “<mark>Climate Change</mark> and Tourism: Responding to Global Challenges”, UNEP and UNWTO, 2007</SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><SPAN style=""color:#ff0000;""><SPAN style=""font-size: 16px;""><STRONG>What are UNWTO’s recommendations to mitigate the effects of tourism growth on <mark>climate change</mark>?</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""text-align: justify;"">UNWTO promotes the high potential of the tourism sector for mitigation of GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions and<STRONG> lowering energy consumption</STRONG>, thanks to the use of alternative fuels and hybrid motors.</LI><LI style=""text-align: justify;"">The accommodation sector has very accessible options to reduce energy, from <STRONG>solar and wind energy</STRONG> to efficient insulation methods, and is developing initiatives to promote local products and avoiding environmentally harmful ones.</LI><LI style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>Air transport remains the main challenge</STRONG>: UNWTO works closely with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), in a search for the best options on <mark>climate change</mark> activities - emissions trading, <mark>carbon</mark> offsets, incentives and taxes, etc.</LI><LI style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>To simply decrease air travel frequency</STRONG> would be an unrealistic task to attempt.
