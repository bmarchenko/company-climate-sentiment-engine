The reader will have to construct the problem-situation from the various clues in the text.  I propose that the problem-situation is the following:  since the standard set of views of science fails because the standard views do not look at the material conditions of the working scientists, what do scientists really do in their work as scientists—within the institutions of scientific work? (See pp. 25ff.)  Moreover, this problem-situation encompasses the narrow problem that still consumes many philosophers. This is the <EM>demarcation problem</EM> (32-34) or, to use <mark>Bunge</mark>’s term, <EM>scientificity</EM>.  Unlike other disciplines, especially those that are not merely non-scientific, and which are instead fake science (or <EM>pseudo-science</EM>), science is “<EM>the self-correcting intellectual process</EM>” (34, <EM>italics in original</EM>). The most widely known philosopher of science that emphasizes the self-correcting feature of genuine science is Popper. <mark>Bunge</mark> takes Popper to task at length regarding Popper’s theory of the self-correcting nature of science that is supposedly due to scientists’ constant attempt to <EM>falsify</EM> their own and each other’s conjectures. (See pp. 38-40).  <mark>Bunge</mark> concisely sums up his arguments against Popper’s <EM>falsifiability criterion of demarcation</EM>: “…Popper’s advice, to try and topple one’s favourite guesses, is psychologically false in addition to being logically and met[h]odologically flawed” (39). If philosophers had focused on the materialistic question of how scientists actually operate in their places of work (or, on what scientists actually do), philosophers would have come up with the answer:  scientists work within research projects.  Research projects involve many factors, and one of them is that “every new research project builds on previous findings and, <EM>if successful and intriguing</EM>, it may suggest further projects in the same field” (48, my italics). Popper would say, in contrast to <mark>Bunge</mark>, that research projects engender new projects and questions not when their theories and discoveries are <EM>successful</EM>, but when their expectations or predictions turn out <EM>to fail </EM>(<EM>because they are falsified</EM>).</P><P>Though <mark>Bunge</mark> rejects falsification and falsifiability as an engine in the development of research programs, in an apparent and unadmitted concession to Popper, <mark>Bunge</mark> acknowledges that there are scientific controversies (unlike Kuhn where controversies indicate either pre-science, or the beginning of a scientific revolution followed by the supposed <EM>normal</EM> science where no controversies occur.) Moreover – and this is a huge and unadmitted concession to Popper – <mark>Bunge</mark> argues that <EM>internal criticism</EM> or <EM>endoheresy</EM>  is an important engine in driving research programs (54). Falsification is a form of <EM>internal criticism</EM> or <EM>endoheresy</EM>. It entails attempting to refute scientific theories that are part of research projects, through pointing out failed predictions through experimentation and observation. What, then, distinguishes <mark>Bunge</mark> from Popper? The unique and novel feature of <mark>Bunge</mark>’s approach to the philosophy of science is that he turns philosophy of science on its head. The philosophy of science as it has usually been pursued by philosophers, including Karl Popper, sidelines metaphysics or minimizes metaphysics as inspirational for developing properly formed scientific theories and scientific research projects, or turns metaphysics into an extrapolation of science, and thereby turns metaphysics into a subdiscipline of science. <mark>Bunge</mark> flips the standard roles of metaphysics and science by making <EM>scientificity</EM> depend on the appropriate form of metaphysics.</P><P>The very first criteria for the <EM>scientificity</EM> of a research project is metaphysical. If a research project is not realist and not systemically materialist, it should be rejected. Hence, metaphysics outweighs the empirical, including <EM>empirical falsifiability</EM>. A careful reader might note here that, contrary to first appearances, <mark>Bunge</mark> is giving more weight here to metaphysics or philosophy than to science. <mark>Bunge</mark> urges philosophy to become <EM>evidence-based</EM>. <mark>Bunge</mark> says: “Everyone knows that the new science [of the Scientific Revolution and later Darwininsm] knocked down many a popular philosophical myth.” (101) Moreover, “…evidence-based philosophy is still a tantalizing research project, to which this author [<mark>Bunge</mark> himself] has made some contributions” (102). However, when the reader continues, the it becomes apparent that <mark>Bunge</mark> has still turned the tables on the separation of philosophy and science.  <mark>Bunge</mark> does more than put science and philosophy on the same level as two partners in a dialectal discourse, such as Popper did in his later work, where science is used to either refute or carry forward metaphysical research programmes. Rather, <mark>Bunge</mark> puts metaphysics upfront and forward in research projects that are to be scientific. Yet <mark>Bunge</mark> does not advance just any metaphysics. He puts forward a realist metaphysics (See especially, section 8.9 pp. 111 ff.). Moreover, <mark>Bunge</mark> puts forward not just any realist metaphysics, but one that is materialist, and furthermore, systemic.  Moreover, according to <mark>Bunge</mark>, <EM>systemic materialism</EM> is non-eliminative and non-reductive, and must include <EM>emergentism</EM>.  Not only must matter be the ultimate condition for the existence of higher orders and the properties of the higher orders (such as: matter is the basis for life, life is the basis for consciousness, consciousness is the basis for societies and social institutions, and the social, including language, is the basis for human products such as blueprints and philosophy, and memes or themes). Rather, all such orders must emerge from matter, and as emergent, they have special properties, and systems for self-organization.  An endoheretical reader might interject: Emergentism has failed so far in one basic field: quantum mechanics. How does the classical world of ordinary objects emerge from the quantum world? The classical world is the world of “…everyday life.  Suffice it to recall what we do every time we wake up:  we become aware of our immediate surroundings and start navigating in it, avoiding the obstacles in our way. That is, we behave like realists even while professing some irrealist fantasy” (111). The endoheretic might add: we behave like <EM>naive realists</EM> even while professing some sophisticated realism where we treat solidity as a mere appearance, especially when attempting to avoid walking into  a brick wall. So, <EM>emergentism</EM> may, after all, become another philosophical myth as we develop better theories in the various sciences, natural and social. To be fair, <mark>Bunge</mark> has generously appended two essays by colleagues, one (by A. Ibáñez, et. al.)  about how free will is an emergent property or function of the brain, and the other (by M. Mahner) about how the philosophy/science of mind needs a better systemic and emergent metaphysics along the lines developed by <mark>Bunge</mark>.</P><P>In sum: the originality of this book is that it reverses the tables on all current schools of philosophy, where philosophy and metaphysics are separated and isolated from the sciences. <mark>Bunge</mark> teaches that the best in metaphysics is supposed to lead the sciences in new directions. Don’t think that the last two chapters in any way reduce in <mark>Bunge</mark>’s eyes the constructive role of metaphysics in the development of new scientific research projects. The penultimate chapter advocates applying science to all intellectual endeavours (<EM>scientism</EM>). The final chapter advocates keeping technology and science as independent ventures. Technology aims for practical goals that at their best promote human benefit and democracy. Science/scientism aims for truth and the discovery of new facts in all domains of genuine learning. The bottom line for <mark>Bunge</mark> is that science/scientism must be directed by the appropriate form of metaphysics to remain scientific. The punch line for <mark>Bunge</mark> is that practitioners in all intellectual fields need to adopt the appropriate form of metaphysics. Only then will they be enabled to create scientistic research projects. Moreover, only then do we gain a factual basis for making our most important political, moral and social decisions about our environment, and about human well-being.</P><P class=""date""><EM>15 March 2018</EM></P></DIV></DIV></SECTION></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

They note that thanks to the shale-gas revolution in America, emissions last year were 12% lower than a decade earlier. Such attitudes risk causing more of a backlash towards the most resistant companies. BlackRock, a big asset manager, estimates that more than 500 investment firms, with assets of $3.4trn under management, have pledged to divest from fossil-fuel companies. It says that when financial fiduciaries decide where to invest, they should now consider the <mark>climate</mark> impact as well as the likely returns.</P><P>Bevis Longstreth, a former SEC commissioner (and <mark>climate</mark> activist), says such exhortations can have a ripple effect throughout the investment community. Local governments are beginning to unwind their oil and gas investments. It reminds him of the rush to disinvest from big companies that traded with South Africa under apartheid in the 1980s. “It’s like getting out of the theatre when you smell smoke.”</P><P class=""xhead"">Stranded by guesswork</P><P>Yet the industry’s tetchy reaction to the questions raised over the value of its reserves is partly justified. Mr Schneiderman’s probe of ExxonMobil has cast this way and that, like a wildcatter desperately looking for oil. Because oil prices go up and down so much, estimating and valuing reserves is fiendishly hard. It is even harder to predict what regulators might do to counter <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>As for Mr Carney’s worry about stranded assets, the industry argues that it is premature. Countries like Saudi Arabia may have reserves estimated to last 70 years, but oil companies’ proven reserves are much shorter-range, typically 10-15 years. IHS, a research firm, estimates that about 80% of the value of most listed oil companies is based on proven reserves that will be used within that time frame. Daniel Yergin, IHS’s vice-chairman, also points out that the recent collapse in oil prices posed no threat to the stability of the financial system, even though the shock was more abrupt than <mark>climate change</mark> is likely to turn out. He thinks Mr Carney has overstepped the mark.</P><DIV class=""pullquote"">If measures to stop global warming are fully implemented, oil-company revenues could fall by more than $22trn over the next 25 years</DIV><P>All the same, the industry may come under further pressure. Under the aegis of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a body administered by the Group of 20 that monitors the global financial system (and is chaired by Mr Carney), the Task Force on <mark>Climate</mark>-related Financial Disclosures is drawing up global guidelines, due to be presented to the FSB in December, for voluntary disclosure on how to manage <mark>climate</mark> risks. Members of the task force acknowledge that these risks may be tricky to account for on the balance-sheet, especially as it is not clear what future regulations governments will impose. IHS argues that such rules could harm fossil-fuel companies by putting off lenders and giving an advantage to state-owned rivals that would not face the same pressures from investors.</P><P>One of the advisers to the task force, Mark Lewis, of Barclays, says that if measures to stop global warming are fully implemented, oil-company revenues could fall by more than $22trn over the next 25 years, more than twice the predicted decline for the gas and coal industries combined. Mr Lewis sees a cautionary tale in the woes of European utilities, hit by government action to penalise coal and nuclear power. They have suffered such a devastating collapse in their share prices in recent years that some of the biggest, including Germany’s E.ON, have been forced to split off their fossil-fuel businesses. If the big oil companies are encouraged to discuss <mark>climate</mark>-change risks openly, they will have a better chance of avoiding such a fate.</P><P> </P><FOOTER itemprop=""publication"" class=""blog-post__foot-note"">This article appeared in the<SPAN itemprop=""articleSection"">Special report</SPAN>section of the print edition under the headline<SPAN>&quot;Taken to task&quot;</SPAN></FOOTER><DIV class=""blog-post__siblings-list-aside ""><SPAN class=""blog-post__side-flytitle"">Special report: Breaking the habit</SPAN><SPAN class=""blog-post__side-text"">More in this special report:</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Rainforest Foundation Norway (RFN) has investigated the
investment portfolio for 2016 of Norway’s <A href=""https://www.regnskog.no/en/news/norways-government-pension-fund-global"">Government Pension Fund Global</A> (GPFG),
presented at the launch of the GPFG's annual report on 28 February. The
investigation has disclosed investments just shy of USD 17 billion in sectors with
a high risk of rainforest destruction. This is an increase of 20 percent on the
previous year.</SPAN></P><P>“It’s pretty remarkable that the fund has increased its investments in the Brazilian meat industry by a whopping 285 percent, to USD 146 million, particularly since cattle ranching is the main cause of deforestation in the Amazon”, says senior adviser Vemund Olsen in Rainforest Foundation Norway’s policy and campaign department.</P><H2>     USD 116 million invested in major US deforester </H2><P>     RFN’s investigation reveals that the sovereign wealth fund invests USD 116 million in the US soy trader <mark>Bunge</mark>. The new report &quot;<A href=""http://www.mightyearth.org/mysterymeat/"">Ultimate Mystery Meat</A>” produced by Rainforest Foundation Norway and the American organization <A href=""http://www.mightyearth.org/"">Mighty Earth</A> links <mark>Bunge</mark> to systematic deforestation. </P><P>The report was published on 25 February, and formed the basis for a <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/business/energy-environment/deforestation-brazil-bolivia-south-america.html?_r=0"">major article</A> in the New York Times that same day about how deforestation in the Amazon has come roaring back.</P><P><SPAN class=""redactor-invisible-space"">
In preparing the report, we analyzed satellite images dating
several years back, surveyed supply chains and conducted interviews with local
soybean farmers. The grim conclusion is that between 2011 and 2015, a total of just
over 787,000 hectares Brazilian forests were destroyed in areas where <mark>Bunge</mark> and
Cargill - another American soy trader under scrutiny in the report - are
present. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""redactor-invisible-space""><mark>Bunge</mark>'s name is linked to the lion’s share of this <mark>devastation</mark>: 567,466

The Norwegian fund is a major investor in <mark>Bunge</mark>, at close to USD 116 million.<SPAN class=""redactor-invisible-space"">The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund has previously made it
clear that companies that destroy tropical forests are in danger of being excluded
from the fund's portfolio. The most famous example of this came in 2013, when it emerged that the 
fund had <A href=""https://news.mongabay.com/2013/03/norways-wealth-fund-dumps-23-palm-oil-companies-under-new-deforestation-policy/"">divested from 23 palm oil companies the previous year</A> - including the world's biggest palm oil company, Wilmar. The company responded by making
a <A href=""http://mongabay-images.s3.amazonaws.com/13/Wilmar-Policy.pdf"">formal commitment</A> to stop destroying rainforests.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""redactor-invisible-space"">“We expect the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund to send a
clear message to <mark>Bunge</mark> that the deforestation revealed in our report and the
New York Times article is unacceptable. As one of the world’s largest investors
the fund possesses considerable financial muscle and power to influence
companies. We have seen how the palm oil industry in Indonesia has taken
exclusions and threats of exclusion seriously. We now hope the fund can lean on
<mark>Bunge</mark> to take appropriate action”, says senior adviser Vemund Olsen in the NGO Rainforest
Foundation Norway.</SPAN></P><H2>     Norwegian parliament has set strict requirements to avoid deforestation</H2><P>     Such pressure would be entirely in line with what the Norwegian parliament expects the sovereign wealth fund to do with regards to companies found to fall foul of official Norwegian standards. The fund's <A href=""https://www.nbim.no/en/responsibility/risk-management/<mark>climate</mark>-change2/"">expectations document on <mark>climate change</mark> strategy</A> imposes strict requirements on companies in the portfolio to avoid contributing to tropical deforestation. </P><P>The requirements are that the companies in the fund’s portfolio must not only adopt their own strategies for avoiding deforestation but that they must also work to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains, including third party suppliers. Those same companies are also required to report to the fund on their work in this regard.</P><P>“The revelations in the report and the recent major piece
in New York Times make it fairly obvious that <mark>Bunge</mark> does not meet the Norwegian
sovereign wealth fund's expectations. We expect the fund to show that it takes
its sustainability commitments seriously by demanding a termination of the deforestation
<mark>Bunge</mark> causes”, says Olsen.</P><H2>     Report and campaign to hold Burger King accountable</H2><P>As for Cargill, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund owns only corporate bonds in the company and therefore has few opportunities to exert direct influence. Fortunately, there are other ways to turn up the heat on Cargill. The title of the report &quot;Ultimate Mystery Meat&quot; alludes to the meat used by the international burger giant Burger King. Soy from both Cargill and <mark>Bunge</mark> are in all likelihood used in feed for animals used in hamburgers, bacon and nuggets at Burger King restaurants.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""block-wrapper max-width-wrapper clearfix""><DIV class=""block image half-width""><FIGURE class=""image-wrapper clearfix""><PICTURE><FIGCAPTION class=""image-description""><P>The field team behind the report &quot;Ultimate Mystery Meat&quot; documented several instances of forest having been set ablaze. </P><P class=""byline"">

A direct link can not be established because Burger King fails
to be open about its supply chains. Accusations of contributing to
deforestation have fallen on deaf ears with the international burger giant,
which does not set any requirements for their supply chains to avoid
deforestation. </P><P>This constitutes yet another violation of the sovereign wealth fund's
expectations document on <mark>climate</mark>, as the fund invests some USD 53 million in
Restaurant Brands International (RBI), which owns Burger King.</P><P>“US shareholders of RBI have filed a shareholder proposal
to get the company to commit to avoid deforestation. The Norwegian sovereign
wealth fund should put its considerable weight behind this shareholder proposal
and demand that RBI and Burger King clean up their act”, says Olsen.</P><P><SPAN class=""redactor-invisible-space"">     Rainforest Foundation Norway and Mighty Earth have launched an international campaign to push Burger King to commit to avoiding rainforest destruction. If Burger King requires companies through their entire supply chain to avoid deforestation it may compel Cargill and <mark>Bunge</mark> to finally put an end to deforestation in South America.<SPAN class=""redactor-invisible-space"">

Trucks waiting in line at grain elevator. ©Debra L Ferguson Stock Images </DIV><P>The possible merger of two of the world’s largest grain and oilseed processing companies likely wouldn’t move prices for farmers. However, it likely would have a bigger impact on farmers outside the heart of the Corn Belt.  </P><P>That’s the view of at least one land-grant university economist who has been looking at the possibilities.</P><P>Speculation has been swirling about reports that Archer Daniels Midland may be in talks to take over <mark>Bunge</mark> Ltd. Leaders for the two companies have been tight-lipped. So far, there’s also been little analysis about a corporate marriage of two major agricultural commodity buyers that combined for about $106 billion in sales last year. ADM reported $60.8 billion in annual net sales in 2017, while <mark>Bunge</mark> made about $45.8 billion in net sales in 2017.</P><P>Chad Hart, associate professor of economics, crop markets specialist and Extension economist at Iowa State University, said it’s difficult to say how such a merger among global grain and oilseed giants would affect farmers.</P><P>“With tighter margins, companies are looking at how can we wring more out of the system,” Hart said. “When I’m looking here at this proposal, to me when I’m looking at the two, what I see is ADM is the stronger company in North America, while <mark>Bunge</mark> is a little stronger in the South American market. It’s creating the marketing arm that reaches all across the Americas and helps streamline how they move product from the farm to the end-user.”</P><P><STRONG>ADM’s Chief Executive Officer Juan Luciano</STRONG> declined to talk about press reports to that effect during a quarterly earnings call earlier this month. Luciano did say ADM is looking to make strategic acquisitions and mergers to fill holes in the company’s business.</P><P><STRONG><mark>Bunge</mark> CEO Soren Schroder</STRONG> also declined last week to address market rumors. During <mark>Bunge</mark>’s call with analysts, he focused heavily on tightening margins and cost savings. He also wasn’t certain that consolidation in the grain and oilseed industries would automatically lead to higher margins when it comes to a pair of global companies getting together.</P><P>“Maybe in some areas, but broadly speaking I’m not so sure,” Schroder said in response to an analyst’s question. “It’s a fairly fragmented business with barriers to entry that aren’t all that significant. So, it’s more about how you run your assets that determines your profitability. So, there are certainly pockets where that is the case, but on a global scale, I’d say probably not.”</P><H2>HOW WILL IT AFFECT FARMERS</H2><P>If ADM makes the move, Hart said farmers likely are going to see fewer marketing outlets as the companies would combine operations.</P><P>However, unlike mergers in the seed business there still is a fair amount of competition in crop marketing. “In the heart of the Corn Belt, there’s still plenty of marketing outlets out there that are independent of ADM and <mark>Bunge</mark>,” he said.</P><P>“When I’m looking at the state of Iowa, you’re talking about 350 to 400 marketing points for corn and soybeans. ADM and <mark>Bunge</mark> have a lot, but there still would be well over 200 still outside the big four marketing chain. We still have a lot of competition in the marketing of grain.”</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Hart said producers in regions outside of the Corn Belt, where more marketing outlets are owned by fewer companies, could see a less-competitive marketing situation. “That’s when the market power shows up more,” he said. “I’d be more concerned about that looking at port of New Orleans and Gulf area where the big four are larger.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>For the broader ag economy, Hart said such a combined company could result in improved efficiency in moving commodities from the farm to end-users.</P><P>“As far as individual farmers seeing benefits, it’s not going to move prices for corn and soybeans enough for farmers to where they would see in their pocketbooks,” Hart said.</P><P>There should be some concern, he said, about whether such a merger could create opportunities for price manipulation.</P><P>“I don’t think that’s the case,” Hart said. “I’m less worried about that here in the marketing segment than I was in seed mergers. Seed mergers, the big three dominate. Here you’re talking about two of the big four, but they don’t represent 80% of marketing side of things.”</P><P>On the local level, he said farmers could benefit from marketing ideas shared between ADM and <mark>Bunge</mark>. That could mean new contract price opportunities, Hart said, including average-price contracting.</P><H2>ADM, <mark>BUNGE</mark> BY THE NUMBERS</H2><P>Based on DTN’s research, ADM would add to its business in a number of segments if a deal can be struck.</P><P>ADM currently operates about 500 grain elevators, ports and shipping terminals in 170 countries, including 270 ingredient manufacturing plants, 44 <mark>innovation</mark> centers, as well as an extensive crop transportation network.</P><P>In North America alone, the company operates more than 300 grain elevators, ports and shipping terminals. ADM runs about 70 oilseed operations in the United States, including 25 crushing plants and 27 oilseed refineries. ADM boasts 17 wet and dry mill corn processing plants in the U.S., producing both ethanol and distillers grains.</P><P>In addition, <mark>Bunge</mark> operates 21 ports in the U.S., Canada, South America, Australia, Vietnam, Turkey and Ukraine. ADM owns or leases grain elevators in seven Brazilian states, including 20 in Mato Grosso. ADM owns five soybean processing plants and a biodiesel plant in Brazil, as well as three fertilizer blending plants.</P><P>Although ADM already has a significant business in South America, primarily in Brazil, acquiring <mark>Bunge</mark> would come with key additions in South America.</P><H2>EDIBLE OILS</H2><P>Perhaps one of <mark>Bunge</mark>’s strong suits in what it could add to ADM comes in its edible oils packaging and refining capabilities.</P><P>In its 2017 fourth quarter financials, <mark>Bunge</mark> reports near-record results in its edible oils business. In addition, the company is undertaking a key acquisition in the space.</P><P><mark>Bunge</mark> is expected to close its acquisition of oils and fats producer Loders Croklaan in the first quarter of this year, Schroder said in the company’s latest financial report.</P><P>In its fourth-quarter financials, however, ADM’s adjusted operating profit in oilseeds processing decreased by 15.5% from year to year.</P><P><mark>Bunge</mark> already operates 69 edible oil refineries and packaging plants in North America, South America, Europe, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Ukraine, the Russian Federation, India, Vietnam and China.</P><P><mark>Bunge</mark> also owns 17 mills in the U.S., China and Mexico, and 52 oilseed facilities in the U.S., Canada, South America, Europe, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Turkey, Ukraine, the Russian Federation, China and Vietnam.</P><P>In Brazil, ADM is Brazil’s overall fifth-largest exporter. The company is Brazil’s largest soybean meal exporter, and second largest exporter of soybeans. ADM is the country’s largest domestic meal supplier, second-largest soybean crusher and second-largest bottled oil producer.</P><P><mark>Bunge</mark> operates eight sugarcane facilities in Brazil. However, the company said it is in the process of exiting the sugarcane milling and trade business.</P><P>There are potential benefits to farmers if ADM expands its grain-handling capabilities. If ADM gained <mark>Bunge</mark>’s 74 grain facilities in North America, its storage capacity in the U.S., for example, would expand to 14 million tons — making ADM the largest grain handler in the U.S.</P><P>If a company has more storage to access, it can use it to move grain volumes to areas of the business where more supplies are needed. This can, in some respects, benefit markets in general.</P><P>Such a transaction will be subject to federal antitrust scrutiny.</P><H2>CONCENTRATION CONCERNS</H2><P>Neil Harl, Charles F. Curtiss distinguished professor in agriculture, emeritus professor of economics at Iowa State University, has been monitoring and writing about consolidation in agriculture for much of his career.</P><P>He said he continues to hope the U.S. government will pay close attention to possible implications of ag concentration.</P><P>In particular, Harl said he has been concerned about concentration in the animal slaughter business, seed production, grain handling, farm machinery and equipment, and control of fertilizer supplies worldwide.</P><P>“My position has been that the federal agencies monitoring concentration have been less than aggressive, particularly since the 1980s with the change of leadership in Washington, especially with respect to mergers,” he said.</P><P>During the early years of Barack Obama’s administration, Harl said, an attempt was made to “re-energize antitrust.” However, he said that ran into resistance.</P><P>“It is never too late to right a wrong in government, business or academe,” Harl said.</P><P>“I am adamantly opposed to any merger or acquisition that moves the level of concentration above 50% and any proposed merger or acquisition should be scrutinized well below that level. The evils of concentration are well known. Healthy and open competition in the long-term continues to be the most important feature of any government and of any economic system.”</P><P>Todd Neeley can be reached at todd.neeley@dtn.com</P><P>Follow him on Twitter @toddneeleyDTN.</P></DIV><FOOTER class=""entry-footer""><TABLE cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" border=""0"" width=""100%""><TBODY><TR><TD height=""10""> </TD></TR><TR><TD bgcolor=""#4a547d"" align=""center""><FONT size=""1"" face=""Verdana,Arial"" color=""#ccceda"">Copyright DTN.

Flyknit reduces waste by 80% <A href=""https://www.scribd.com/document/270293194/Green-Giants-How-Smart-Companies-Turn-Sustainability-Into-Billion-Dollar-Businesses-Free-Excerpt"">compared with regular cut and sew footwear</A>.   Since its launch in 2012, Flyknit has reduced <A href=""http://news.nike.com/news/four-years-of-nike-flyknit"">3.5 million pounds of waste</A> and fully transitioned from yarn to recycled polyester, diverting 182 million bottles from landfills.</P><P>Recognizing the growing consumer interest in <mark>sustainable</mark> products and looking to solve consumer challenges such as high energy costs, CPG companies have developed new products to gain access to this market. Proctor &amp; Gamble, for example, conducted a life cycle assessment of its products and found that U.S. households spend 3% of annual electricity budgets on heating water to wash clothes. In 2005, they launched a U.S. and European <A href=""http://tide.com/en-us/shop/type/liquid/tide-coldwater-clean-liquid"">line of cold-water detergents</A> that require 50% less energy than warm water washing.</P><P>Facing strict regulation on chemical release and competition from flowers from Africa, the Dutch flower industry developed a closed-loop system that grows flowers hydroponically in greenhouses, lowering risk of infestation and reducing the use of fertilizers and pesticides. The system also improves product quality by creating regulated growing conditions. <A href=""/1995/09/green-and-competitive-ending-the-stalemate"">Their innovative system has</A> increased productivity and quality, reduced environmental impact and costs, and increased global competitiveness.</P><P><STRONG>Improving Financial Performance</STRONG></P><P>Many business leaders have the erroneous perception that one can have profits or sustainability, but not both.  This probably has its roots in Milton Friedman’s 50-year old, but still influential, thesis that the only business of a business is profit as well as a hangover from the 1970s and 80s, when low quality, high priced environmental products failed in the market and early socially responsible investing delivered low returns. That conventional wisdom has now reversed.</P><P>In addition to the financial benefits that accrue from increased competitive advantage and <mark>innovation</mark> as discussed earlier, companies are realizing significant cost savings through environmental sustainability-related operational efficiencies. Moreover, investors are now able to track the high performers on ESG (environmental, social and governance factors) and are correlating better financial performance with better ESG performance.</P><P>Significant cost reductions <A href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability-and-resource-"">can result</A> from improving operational efficiency through better management of natural resources like water and energy, as well as minimizing waste. <A href=""http://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/sites/default/files/The%20<mark>Climate</mark>%20Has%20Changed_2.pdf"">One study </A>estimated that companies experience an average internal rate of return of 27% to 80% on their low <mark>carbon</mark> investments.</P><P>Since 1994, Dow has invested nearly $2 billion in improving resource efficiency and has <A href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability-and-resource-productivity/our-insights/the-business-of-sustainability-mckinsey-global-survey-results"">saved $9.8 billion</A> from reduced energy and wastewater consumption in manufacturing.  In 2013, GE had reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 32% and water use by 45% compared to 2004 and 2006 baselines, respectively, resulting in<A href=""http://www.environmentalleader.com/2015/04/09/ge-reduces-freshwater-use-45/""> $300 million in savings</A>.</P><P>A focus on sustainability can also unlock opportunities for process and logistics savings. Wal-Mart, for example, aimed to double fleet efficiency between 2005 and 2015 through better routing, truck loading, driver training, and advanced technologies. By the end of 2014, they had improved fuel efficiency approximately 87% compared to the 2005 baseline. In that year, these improvements <A href=""https://cdn.corporate.walmart.com/c0/24/2383f0674d27823dcf7083e6fbc6/2015-global-responsibility-report.pdf"">resulted in</A> 15,000 metric tons of <mark>CO2</mark> emissions avoided and savings of nearly $11 million.</P><P>Mounting evidence shows that <mark>sustainable</mark> companies deliver significant positive financial performance, and investors are beginning to value them more highly. Arabesque and University of Oxford <A href=""http://www.arabesque.com/index.php?tt_down=51e2de00a30f88872897824d3e211b11"">reviewed</A> the academic literature on sustainability and corporate performance and found that 90% of 200 studies analyzed conclude that good ESG standards lower the cost of capital; 88% show that good ESG practices result in better operational performance; and 80% show that stock price performance is positively correlated with good sustainability practices.</P><P>Here are some other datapoints to consider: Between 2006 and 2010, the top 100 <mark>sustainable</mark> global companies experienced <A href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-011-1063-y"">significantly higher </A>mean sales growth, return on assets, profit before taxation, and cash flows from operations in some sectors compared to control companies. During the 2008 recession, companies committed to sustainability practices achieved “above average” performance in the financial markets, translating into <A href=""https://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/6972076a-9cdc-4b20-bc3a-d2a4c43c9c21"">an average of </A>$650 million in incremental market capitalization per company. Additionally, companies with superior environmental performance experienced <A href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2010.01064.x"">lower cost of debt</A> by 40-45 basis points. Studies<A href=""http://www.issuelab.org/resource/project_roi_report_defining_the_competitive_and_financial_advantages_of_corporate_responsibility_and_sustainability""> also suggest that</A> companies with strong corporate responsibility reputations “experience no meaningful declines in share price compared to their industry peers during crises” versus firms with poor CSR reputations whose reputations declined by “2.4-3%; a market capitalization loss of $378M per firm.”</P><P>Investors are paying attention. According to the 2015 EY Global Institutional Investor Survey, investors are increasingly using companies’ nonfinancial disclosures to inform their investment decisions. In its survey of over 200 institutional investors, 59.1% of respondents view nonfinancial disclosures as “essential” or “important” to investment decisions, up from 34.8% in 2014. Some 62.4% of investors <A href=""http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-tomorrows-investment-rules-2/$FILE/EY-tomorrows-investment-rules-2.0.pdf"">are concerned about</A> the risk of stranded assets (i.e. assets that lose value prematurely due to environmental, social, or other external factors) and over one-third of respondents reported cutting their holdings of a company in the past year because of this risk.</P><P><STRONG>Building Customer Loyalty</STRONG></P><P>Companies are skeptical about consumer interest in <mark>sustainable</mark> products – especially where willingness-to-pay is concerned.  Some of that is self-inflicted, as early on companies tended to increase “<mark>sustainable</mark>” product prices substantially and in some cases sold inferior products (e.g. pricy natural cleaning products that did not work).</P><P>However, a shift is occurring in the minds of consumers. Today’s consumers <A href=""https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-un-global-compact-consumer-study-marketing-mattering"">expect more </A>transparency, honesty, and tangible global impact from companies and can choose from a raft of <mark>sustainable</mark>, competitively priced, high quality products.  In fact, one study found that among numerous factors surveyed, the news coverage regarding environmental and social responsibility was <A href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/crr.2009.28"">the only significant factor</A> that affected respondents’ evaluation of a firm and intent to buy.</P><P><A href=""http://www.globescan.com/component/edocman/?view=document&amp;id=46&amp;"">Nearly two-thirds</A> of consumers across six international markets believe they “have a responsibility to purchase products that are good for the environment and society” — 82% in emerging markets and 42% in developed markets. In the food and beverage industry, a growing number of consumers are considering values beyond price and taste in their purchasing decisions, such as <A href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/consumer-business/us-fmi-gma-report.pdf"">safety, social impact, and transparency</A>.</P><P>Far from feeling skittish about buying <mark>sustainable</mark> products, today’s consumers <A href=""http://www.chernev.com/research/articles/DoingWellByDoingGood_2015.pdf"">perceive a higher level of product performance</A> in products from <mark>sustainable</mark> companies and sustainability information has a significantly positive impact on consumers’ evaluation of a company, <A href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-011-0908-8"">which translates into purchase intent</A>. The results of these studies support that consumers in a post-Recession era <A href=""http://www.thelabyr.com.ar/web/wp-content/themes/thelab/pdfs/Y&amp;R_Publications/SPEND_SHIFT.pdf"">are shifting purchasing decisions</A> to brands with integrity, social responsibility, and sustainability at their core. In fact, Unilever claims its “brands with purpose” are growing at <A href=""http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/1345772/unilever-says-brands-purpose-growing-twice-speed-others-portfolio"">twice the rate </A>as others in their portfolio.</P><P>Companies can also charge higher price premiums based on positive corporate responsibility performance. These premiums can reach 20% <A href=""http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/17471111011051720"">according to some estimates</A>. Moreover, some studies show that <A href=""http://scholar.harvard.edu/hiscox/publications/buying-green-field-experimental-tests-consumer-support-environmentalism"">overall sales revenue can increase </A>up to 20% due to corporate responsibility practices.</P><P>Another study found that revenues from <mark>sustainable</mark> products and services grew at six times the rate of overall company revenues between 2010 and 2013, among the 12 members of the S&amp;P Global 100 sampled (Singer, 2015). GE’s Ecomagination division, for example, has generated <A href=""https://www.fastcoexist.com/3054441/9-ways-ge-executed-its-radical-green-reinvention"">$200 billion in sales since 2005</A>. IKEA’s line of <mark>sustainable</mark> products like LED bulbs and solar panels from its Products for a More <mark>Sustainable</mark> Life at Home now generate <A href=""https://www.scribd.com/document/270293194/Green-Giants-How-Smart-Companies-Turn-Sustainability-Into-Billion-Dollar-Businesses-Free-Excerpt"">a billion dollars</A>.</P><P><STRONG>Attracting and Engaging Employees</STRONG></P><P>Corporate sustainability initiatives aimed at improving ESG performance and proving value to society can increase employee loyalty, efficiency, and productivity and improve HR statistics related to recruitment, retention, and morale.</P><P>Research <A href=""http://www.ioe.ucla.edu/perch/resources/2013-delmas-pekovic.pdf"">is finding that</A> 21<SUP>st</SUP> century employees are focusing more on mission, purpose, and work-life balance. Companies that invest in sustainability initiatives tend to create sought-after culture and engagement due to company strategy focusing more on purpose and providing value to society.  In addition, companies who embed sustainability in their core business strategy treat employees as critical stakeholders, just as important as shareholders. Employees are <A href=""https://www.scribd.com/document/270293194/Green-Giants-How-Smart-Companies-Turn-Sustainability-Into-Billion-Dollar-Businesses-Free-Excerpt"">proud to work there</A> and feel part of a <A href=""http://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=A3898C"">broader effort</A>.</P><P>One study found that <A href=""https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/toolkits/documents/11-0066_advsustainhr_fnl_full.pdf"">morale was 55% better </A>in companies with strong sustainability programs, compared to those with poor ones, and employee loyalty was 38% better. Better morale and motivation translate into reduced absenteeism and improved productivity. Firms that adopted environmental standards have seen <A href=""http://www.ioe.ucla.edu/perch/resources/2013-delmas-pekovic.pdf"">a 16% increase in productivity</A> over firms that did not adopt sustainability practices.</P><P>Corporate responsibility performance also positively impacts turnover and recruitment. Studies show that firms with greater corporate responsibility performance <A href=""http://3blmedia.com/theCSRfeed/CBSR-Blog-CSR-Driver-Employee-Engagement"">can reduce average turnover</A> over time by 25-50%. It can also <A href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/14720701011085544"">reduce annual quit rates </A>by 3-3.5%, <A href=""https://www.shrm.org/about/foundation/research/documents/retaining%20talent-%20final.pdf"">saving replacement costs</A> up to 90%-200% of an employee’s annual salary for each retained position.</P><P style=""text-align: center;"">***</P><P>The preponderance of evidence shows that sustainability is going mainstream.  Executives can no longer afford to approach sustainability as a “nice to have” or as solid function separated from the “real” business.  Those companies that proactively make sustainability core to business strategy will drive <mark>innovation</mark> and engender enthusiasm and loyalty from employees, customers, suppliers, communities and investors.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""authors mvl"" js-target=""authors-section""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""content-area--article column""><DIV class=""is-inline-block width-100pct""><P class=""mbn description-text ""><A href=""/search?term=tensie+whelan"" class=""font-size-xlarge line-height-tight"">Tensie Whelan</A> is the Director of NYU Stern School of Business’s Center for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Business, which she launched in January 2016.

A reasonnably awake high school student willthus correctly understand that the combination of the other factors should be divided by 4.</P><UL><LI>Looking at the next term from the right, we then have an easy solution: divide the economic output per person (GDP/POP) by 4 ! Well… mathematics and our desires then oppose a little, for a deliberate choice of a recession is generaly not the option priviledged by leaders in most countries in the world. But… it does not mean that it won’t happen ! And actually recessions will happen more and more often from now, in the short term <A href=""http://jancovici.com/en/energy-transition/oil/is-the-price-of-oil-driving-the-economy/"">because of the upstream constraint on fossil fuels</A>, and in the longer term because of the downstream constraint (<mark>climate change</mark>), that will degrade a number of natural assets that are essential to an economic output, even if we don’t measure it –<A href=""http://jancovici.com/en/energy-transition/societal-choices/could-the-economy-shrink/"">though don’t realize it</A>.But today, we all wish that “growth” goes on, among “rich” countries as well as among “poor” countries. A very conservative estimate of a 2% growth of the economic output per person, what is well below what every elected representative tries to promise, increases the ratio GDP/POP by 2,2 in 40 years, leading to an overall increase of the GDP of 2,8 between 2010 and 2050. The remaining terms on the right hand side of the equation therefore have to be divided by over 8 to ensure that <mark>CO2</mark> emissions are limited to a third of the 2010 level in 2050.Before we go on, let’s recall that economic growth designates only the <A href=""http://jancovici.com/en/energy-transition/societal-choices/could-the-economy-shrink/"">growth of the output of goods or services that are man made</A>, but accounts for zero the concomittent and irreversible vanishing of non renewable resources – ores, fossil fuels…– that are necessary for our production, as well as the future degradations due to <mark>pollution</mark>s of all kind, including <mark>climate change</mark>. Taking this second factor with figures that are not more stupid than anything else could easily bring us to the conclusion that <A href=""http://jancovici.com/en/energy-transition/societal-choices/could-the-economy-shrink/"">we are already declining</A>.</LI></UL><P><STRONG>We now have a division by 8 to 9 to perform on the following expression:</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: center;""><SPAN class=""wp-katex-eq"" data-display=""false"">\text{\scriptsize{<mark>Carbon</mark> content of energy} }\times \text{\scriptsize{Energy intensity of economy}}</SPAN></P><UL><LI>Can we divide the energy intensity by 8 in 50 years ?

(and obviously if the world decides to dismiss nuclear energy it increases a bit the call on renewables, see below). Let’s begin with renewables, which, in 2010, gave humanity a fat 15% of its primary energy consumption (electricity is accounted for with a primary equivalent), that is 2,1 billion tonnes oil equivalent.</P><DIV class=""pure-g figure_layout""><DIV class=""pure-u-1-1 gutter-1-2""><P><EM>Breakdown of the world renewable energy consumption in 2010, in millions tonnes oil equivalent (1 tonne oi equivalent = 11600 kWh ; electricity is converted with the primary <A href=""http://jancovici.com/en/energy-transition/electricity/what-is-exactely-the-share-of-electricity-in-frances-energy-consumption/"">energy equivalent</A>).</EM></P><P>The world uses 12,4 billion tonnes oil equivalent (that is 12 400 million, if I still know how to multiply by 1000), which allows to see that wood represents about 10% of the world total, hydroelectricity a large 5%, and then all the rest is marginal.</P><P><SPAN style=""color: #999999;"">Sources : various</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV><P>Can we multiply by 7 the whole renewable supply ? To find out, let’s go on playing the stupid game of “elemntary mathematics”:</P><UL><LI>Multiplying the wood supply by 7 would lead to 8 billion tonnes oil equivalent per year, with no deforestation. It happens that, with just 10% of the world total, wood consumption is already leading to deforestation (10% to 20% of the world wood consumption corresponds to deforestation). Let’s assume that this issue is solved, just for the sake of going on. An hectare of forest gives about 3 tonnes oil equivalent of wood each year when managed in a “renewable” way (which means that the annual crop is no more than the annual growth). Therefore getting 8 billion tonnes oil equivalent of wood (or biomass) means 33 million km2 of forests dedicated to energy production, that is 20% of emerged land or… the equivalent of present forests. If we use crops with a higher yield (say 5 to 6 tonnes oil equivalent per hectare and per year in net output), it still means 50% of the surface covered by woods or by croplands. Not a piece of cake… and if we should use algae culture in the deserts to do so, solid caluculations have still to be made on one hand, and the issue on the average growth rate which is debated below for wind also remains.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Can we multiply, in the same time, the output of hydropower by 7 ? In a number of zones it mihgt be considered, with significant nuisances along (large dams mean large nuisances, and small dams mean marginal productions…), but not in Europe, where <A href=""http://jancovici.com/en/energy-transition/renewables/hydroelectricity-our-silver-bullet/"">most of the potential has been equiped</A>.</LI></UL><UL><LI>All the other sources (biogas, biofuels, wind, photovoltaïc, etc), even multiplied by 7, remain totally marginal compared to a doubled energy consumption, and they should be multiplied by far more than 7 in the coming 40 year to make for the difference. Incidentally we can notice that for renewable energies, there is a law that applies pretty well in most occidental countries: their real contribution to the world supply is a reverse function of the number of pages they have in the media !</LI></UL><UL><LI>Let’s suppose, for example, that we wish to settle our problem with mostly wind power, a very fancy item among renewable advocates. If we want to get 22 billion tonnes oil equivalent of total energy in 2050 while dividing <mark>CO2</mark> emissions by three at the same time, and if we suppose that wind power makes for most of the “<mark>carbon</mark>less energy” which is needed, we should increase wind production by 14% per year over 40 years, which means a multiplication by… 160 in 2050.It also means that 12,7 billion tonnes oil equivalent would come from wind.</LI></UL><P>14% per year, after all, should not afraid anyone given the present growth rates.</P><DIV class=""pure-g figure_layout""><DIV class=""pure-u-1-1 gutter-1-2""><P><EM>Annual growth rate of wind intalled capacities in the world since 1996.</EM></P><P><SPAN style=""color: #999999;"">Sources : BP Statistical Review 2013</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV><P>But now let’s open a history book: for how long have fossil fuels – that have replaced renewable energies, and there must be a reason ! – sustained a growth rate over 14% ? Answer: not that long…</P><DIV class=""pure-g figure_layout""><DIV class=""pure-u-1-1 gutter-1-2""><P><EM>The above curves represent, for each mainstream energy, the 10 year running average of the growth rate since 1860.</EM></P><P>The value is for the end of the 10 year period, e. g. the value for 1960 represents the average growth rate for the period 1950-1960. The value for 1940 represents the average growth rate for the period 1930-1940, etc.</P><P>Except for oil at its early stages (it then represented only several % of the world supply) no major source has kept a growth rate over 10% for 50 years. As soon as an energy becomes “mature”, its annual growth rate fall below 5%, and one should keep in mind that these growth rates occurred in a world where the productivity was increasing, <A href=""http://jancovici.com/en/energy-transition/societal-choices/could-the-economy-shrink/"">as a result of the increase of the energy available per capita</A>.</P><P>It is therefore a bold assumption to make that “uneasy energies” (such as wind, diffuse and intermittent) will be able to sustain higher growth rates than “easy energies” (such as fossil fuels, <A href=""http://jancovici.com/en/energy-transition/coal/producing-coal-what-is-it-about/"">very cheap to extract</A> and giving very high power on demand), what’s more in a world where the productivity of “physical” work should decrease… precisely because <A href=""http://jancovici.com/en/energy-transition/societal-choices/could-the-economy-shrink/"">of a lack of “concentrated” energies</A> (it’s this productivity that counts to build grids and power stations, and… windmills).</P><P><SPAN style=""color: #999999;"">Source : Schilling et. al and BP Statistical Review for primary data, growth rates from author’s calculations</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV><P>In other words, the most probable forecast for wind is that as soon as it becomes “thicker than the line” its growth rate will slow down (there are excellent “physical” reasons for that). The same evolution can be forecast for photovoltaïcs, which today amounts to a tenth of wind power (or 0,07% of the world primary energy supply).</P><P>A slowing of the growth rate of wind does not mean that its share will not increase: if wind remains at the present level but fossil fuels are divided by 4, the share of wind power will mechanically increase. But in such a case one will easily check that the hypothesis of a GDP growth rate of 2% is not verified !</P><P>Then comes nuclear: multiplying the production by 7 means that within 40 years we should have 3.000 reactors of 1000 MW up and running. 3000 units is about the number of coal power plants operating right now, and it represents 10.000 billion dollars of investments. Knowing that the present world GDP is somewhere around 60.000 billion dollars per year, it is not completely ridiculous as far as money involved is the only issue, and it would not be completely impossible with the know resources in fissile (235 uranium) and fertile (238 uranium and 232 thorium), but it supposes to deploy breeders as fast as possible. And if we want to phase out fossil fuels mostly callin on nuclear because the above calculations suggest that renewable won’t do enough of the job, it’s rather two to four times that amount that we should aim at.</P><H2>Can we be serious on both GDP and <mark>climate</mark> at the same time ?</H2><P>Of course, another alternative is to consider from the very start that “degrowth” will be a normal process in the future (which means that the global amount of material flows per individual is bound to decrease). It is kind of equivalent to accepting that a kind of diet is a desirable evolution. We do not want that, of course, as <A href=""http://jancovici.com/en/readings/societies/democracy-in-america-alexis-de-tocqueville-1835/"">Tocqueville has correctely guessed more than a century and a half ago</A>. But even if we don’t wan’t to, can we avoid it ?</P><P>It happens that a division by three of the present <mark>CO2</mark> emissions (the term on the left of the Kaya identity) is unavoidable “<A href=""http://jancovici.com/en/<mark>climate</mark>-change/acting-collectively/what-is-concretely-stoping-the-increase-of-<mark>co2</mark>-emissions/"">one day</A>“. Indeed, mathematics impose that, if we have a stock that has been given once and for all, the yearly extraction coming from this stock is bound to start from zero (that is easy to verify !), go through a maximum, then tend again to zero with time. Fossil fuels fulfill the only necessary condition: the <A href=""http://jancovici.com/en/energy-transition/oil/how-do-oil-gas-and-coal-get-created/"">initial stock is given once and for all</A>. Therefore their extraction – thus consumption – will peak one day, and decline thereafter, And obviously, <mark>CO2</mark> emissions that arise from burning fossil fuel cannot do something else than following the same curve than fossil fuel use.</P><DIV class=""pure-g figure_layout""><DIV class=""pure-u-1-1 gutter-1-2""><P><EM>General aspect of the extraction (over time) of a resource for which the initial stock is given once and for all. </EM></P><P>The surface below the curve is the cumulated extraction and its value from beginning to end is at most equal to the initial extractible stock (which for oil is called an <A href=""http://jancovici.com/en/energy-transition/oil/what-is-an-oil-reserve/"">ultimate reserve</A>).</P><P>Human borne <mark>CO2</mark> emissions will behave the same way. The only question regarding the maximum is when at the latest, how high at most, and what process will lead us through (our will, or the collapse of our industrial society, everything can be considered !).</P></DIV></DIV><P>Well, if <mark>CO2</mark> emissions have to tend to zero with time “some day”, il means that there will come a time when world emissions will be forever below a third of the present value. We do not know exactely when and how it will happen, but it is absolutely certain that it will happen, and probably not in three centuries.</P><P>In this kind of context, which will <A href=""http://jancovici.com/en/energy-transition/oil/is-the-price-of-oil-driving-the-economy/"">most probably include a set of recessions</A>, it is not sure that engineers will be able to go fast enough on “efficient economy” (the ratio TOE/GDP basically refers to all that engineers can do to make more efficient cars, coffee machines, houses, and trains) and on “<mark>carbon</mark>less energy” (the ratio <mark>CO2</mark>/TOE basically refers to all that engineers can do to increase the share of renewables, nuclear, and <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage in energy supply) to allow a division by 9 in time of the “<mark>carbon</mark> content of the economy”. Such a division by 9 is indispensable, though, to have both economic growth <STRONG>and</STRONG> <mark>CO2</mark> emission declining (and the latter will eventually win).</P><P>The main characteristic of an identity being that both sides remain equal, it means that a division by 3 of the left term “one day” will necessary translate into a division by the same number on the right at the same time. Because of what is mentionned above, the most probable outcome is that it will come from the terms POP and/or GDP/POP, and <STRONG>that the more we wait to “de<mark>carbon</mark>ize” the economy, the harder we will fall.</STRONG></P><P>Ironically, in such a context, all politicians that advocate to phase out nuclear first to make the world more stable are paradoxally contributing to exactely the opposite, by suppressing one of the possibilities to lower the ratio <mark>CO2</mark>/TOE as fast as possible, which therefore increases the probability that the term GDP/POP and POP get hit harder when <mark>CO2</mark> decreases, because it’s only maths. Saying that phasing out nuclear power plants increases the risks of wars and starvation is not the least puzzling, I suppose, for an ecologist militant, sincerely convinced that nuclear energy is the worst of things !</P><P>And maths are also definitely hateful for all classical economists: with this bl… GDP, a “stable recessive state” will be very hard to avoid, not because it is desirable, but because, alas for us, our world is a finite one. Therefore keeping the GDP as the main thing we want to grow would not be very wise: keeping an indicator that will most probably behave more and more often differently from what we wish is not compatible with a positive mindset. We’d better move to something else !</P></SECTION></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

The consortium meeting of the EU-Project “<STRONG>Divercities – Governing Urban Diversity” (www.urbandivercities.eu) </STRONG>was held June 24-27 at UFZ. The project investigates how urban diversity can contribute to social cohesion, social mobility and economic performance in cities and neighbourhoods. The research is based on 14 European cities. The international meeting congregated 14 partner institutions and 47 researchers from all over Europe in Leipzig. On June 25, in the context of the consortium meeting, two public lectures by Yuri Kazepov (University Vienna, Austria), Kadri Leetmaa and Tiit Tammaru (University of Tartu, Estland) addressed the role of social differentiation and poverty alleviation in <mark>sustainable</mark> urban development. The meeting concluded with a workshop discussing “Urban Diversity vs. Urban Inequality”. Further information:

J.P. Morgan analyst Ann Duignan reported that this agreement “ends in the next few weeks,” at which point it is possible that Glencore and ADM may enter into a bidding war for <mark>Bunge</mark>. Since the announcement, last week ADM shares were up 7.7 percent and <mark>Bunge</mark>’s shares were up 5.5 percent versus gains in the S&amp;P 500 of 2.2 percent. ADM also owns 24.9 percent of Wilmar International, the largest global palm oil trader.</P><P><mark>Bunge</mark> had announced last September 2017 that it was <A href=""https://chainreactionresearch.com/2017/09/13/the-chain-<mark>bunge</mark>-buys-iois-specialty-fats-business-<mark>bunge</mark>-and-ioi-maintain-zero-deforestation-policies/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">acquiring</A> a 70 percent controlling ownership interest in IOI Corporation’s Loders Croklaan specialty fats business for USD 946 million.</P><P>ADM, <mark>Bunge</mark>, ADM’s Wilmar investment, and <mark>Bunge</mark>’s Loders Croklaan investment all have significant deforestation supply chain commitments. The proposed acquisition would require integration of these four firms’ supply chain tracing and tracking tools. This could benefit the market as Wilmar’s No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation upstream commitment and its public dashboard does inform key buyer Loders Croklaan’s ability to achieve its own NDPE commitment, positively impacting Loders’ EU market sales position.</P><P>Both companies have No Deforestation, No Exploitation (NDE) commitments for soy as well, but ADM’s commitment is more advanced and innovative as it also includes no deforestation of High Conservation Value and High <mark>Carbon</mark> Stock areas. Yet both have remaining gaps addressing excluding legal deforestation and providing full supply chain transparency from farm to mill. Chain Reaction Research highlighted these issues in its December 2017 report <A href=""https://chainreactionresearch.com/2017/12/19/<mark>bunge</mark>-key-position-in-cerrado-state-puts-zero-deforestation-commitment-at-risk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow""><mark>Bunge</mark>: Key Position in Cerrado State Puts Zero-Deforestation Commitment at Risk</A>.</P><P><STRONG>Anti-Trust Hurdles and Opportunities</STRONG></P><P>Driving this flurry of potential consolidation is an environment of low interest rates coupled with the reality that currently the ABCD major agricultural trading firms ADM, <mark>Bunge</mark>, Cargill and Dreyfus are all facing tight margins, and greater supply chain scrutiny.</P><P>In January 2018, the EU Parliament voted in favor of a ban on the use of palm oil in biofuels from 2021, which would widen palm oil biofuels’ discount relative to other competitive products, possibly negatively impacting ADM’s Wilmar position. Basically, ADM may buy <mark>Bunge</mark> to compensate to compensate for a possible future decrease in palm oil-based biofuels profit. According to Bloomberg, 46 percent of the EU’s palm oil imports are for biodiesel, with total imports in 2017 up 5.1 percent year over year to 7.5 million metric tons.</P><P>Wilmar is also currently in a trade dispute with the U.S. Department of Commerce who announced in November 2017 <A href=""https://chainreactionresearch.com/2017/12/04/the-chain-u-s-biodiesel-indonesian-countervailing-duty-ruling-may-impact-wilmar-others/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">countervailing</A> duties on imported biodiesel from Indonesian and Argentina. The Government of Canada has challenged this decision, filing a complaint December 20, 2017 with the WTO December 20, 2017 citing over 200 examples of alleged U.S. wrongdoing, including the proposed U.S. countervailing duties against Argentinian and Indonesian biodiesel imports. In a potential preview of the case’s outcome, the WTO <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/01/25/business/25reuters-eu-indonesia-biodiesel.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">ruled</A> on January 25 that the EU must decrease duties – which currently range from 8.8 percent to 20.5 percent – on Indonesian biodiesel imports.</P><P>Further complicating matters, it is not clear that the U.S. Department of Justice will approve significant consolidation in the trading industry through the pending ADM / <mark>Bunge</mark> consolidation play.</P><P>Even though ADM is roughly twice the size of <mark>Bunge</mark> via market capitalization, <mark>Bunge</mark> has 32,000 employees while ADM has 31,800 employees, so opportunities for further efficiency exist if ADM rightsized <mark>Bunge</mark>’s headcount towards ADM’s sales/employee ratio. ADM may be looking to increase its processing capacity outside the U.S. by adding capacity from <mark>Bunge</mark>, where it might find synergies with Wilmar’s global trading presence.</P><P>The value to ADM in purchasing <mark>Bunge</mark> might be to hedge ADM’s palm oil investment by increasing their global soybean capacity as traders often adjust their palm oil and soybean portfolios given which they can profit most on. The spread between the palm oil and soybean oil is also heavily impacted by currency exchange rates and weather-related issues. According to JPMorgan, given the dominant position both palm oil and soybeans play in food and bioenergy globally, by investing in global capacity in both palm oil and soybeans, the proposed ADM purchase of <mark>Bunge</mark> would strengthen ADM while allowing them to shed non-essential <mark>Bunge</mark> assets via direct sales and IPOs.</P><P><STRONG>Dominant Market Position in Food and Dry-Bulk</STRONG></P><P>According to Bloomberg Intelligence , the combined ADM – <mark>Bunge</mark> company (including ADM’s Wilmar investment) would be a super power in the world of agriculture traders. They would control 25 percent of the world’s soybean production, 20 percent of Brazil’s sugarcane production and 22.6 million tons of corn processing capability while becoming a global leader in palm oil trading.</P><P>The proposed acquisition would allow ADM/<mark>Bunge</mark> to use its palm oil commodities to hedge its soybean crop and vice versa. Given that changes in global weather patterns magnified by <mark>climate change</mark> have recently impacted both Indonesian palm oil production and Brazilian soybean production, the proposed company could mitigate these weather-related risks by increasing its market position in each sector.</P><P>Similarly, the combined ADM/<mark>Bunge</mark> company would be among the top five charterers in the world for bulk transport. Yet, they would still only be about 50 percent the size of Cargill’s dry-bulk fleet. While the acquisition would likely hurt dry-bulk shipping rates, it would increase ADM/<mark>Bunge</mark>’s pricing power.</P><P><STRONG>Financial Comments</STRONG></P><P>If allowed to proceed, ADM’s acquisition of <mark>Bunge</mark> would create significant scale in the South American, European and Asian markets and decrease overlapping excess capacity. The impact on consumer prices in uncertain yet market consolidation amongst numerous agriculture commodities will certainly draw regulatory attention.</P><P>One thing to watch is whether the acquisition would impact ADM’s ability to maintain its 25-year track record of increasing dividends to investors. <mark>Bunge</mark> currently trades at about USD 11 billion market capitalization meaning that ADM would have to go to the equity market to issue USD 8 billion to USD 8.5 billion in equity to fund the purchase of <mark>Bunge</mark>. This might dilute ADM’s earnings per share in the near–term, but integrating ADM’s value-added strategy  – including NDE supply chain commitments – with <mark>Bunge</mark>’s commodity strategy and market share could add value to the combined ADM-<mark>Bunge</mark> over the mid-term. The key is ADM’s ability to create uniform public supply chain dashboard that integrates NDPE information across its investment and trading partners.</P><P>Given that <mark>Bunge</mark> Limited is expected to report earnings on February 14, 2018 before market open and ADM is expected to report earnings on February 6, 2018 before the market opens, if the acquisition proceeds, expect a major announcement by ADM by February 6, 2018.  Either way, investors will learn soon if this is bluff by ADM to force Glencore to pay more for <mark>Bunge</mark>.</P></DIV><ASIDE class=""mashsb-container mashsb-main mashsb-stretched""><DIV class=""mashsb-box""><DIV class=""mashsb-buttons""><A class=""mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.valuewalk.com%2F2018%2F02%2Fchain-potential-adm-takeover-<mark>bunge</mark>-carries-uncertain-supply-chain-impacts%2F"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><SPAN class=""text"">Facebook</SPAN></A><A class=""mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow"" href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20Chain%3A%20Potential%20ADM%20Takeover%20of%20<mark>Bunge</mark>%20Carries%20Uncertain%20Supply%20Chain%20Impacts&amp;url=https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/02/chain-potential-adm-takeover-<mark>bunge</mark>-carries-uncertain-supply-chain-impacts/&amp;via=valuewalk"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><SPAN class=""text"">Twitter</SPAN></A><A class=""mashicon-reddit mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow"" href=""http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.valuewalk.com%2F2018%2F02%2Fchain-potential-adm-takeover-<mark>bunge</mark>-carries-uncertain-supply-chain-impacts%2F&amp;title=The+Chain%3A+Potential+ADM+Takeover+of+<mark>Bunge</mark>+Carries+Uncertain+Supply+Chain+Impacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><SPAN class=""text"">Reddit</SPAN></A></DIV></DIV></ASIDE></DIV><FOOTER class=""entry-footer""><DIV class=""post_author vcard""><DIV class=""author-description""><SPAN>Author:  <A class=""url fn n"" href=""https://www.valuewalk.com/author/<mark>climate</mark>adviser/"">Chain Reaction Research</A></SPAN>Chain Reaction Research conducts sustainability risk analysis for financial analysts and investors.

Since we have entered an era of private commitments to deforestation-free supply chains, this article shows that there is still a way to go for some companies to improve their performance.</P><P>Deforestation <A href=""http://www.obt.inpe.br/prodes/prodes_1988_2016n.htm"">estimates</A> in 2016 from the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) indicate a resurgence of deforestation in the Amazon, and deforestation <A href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa5a2f"">hotspots</A> identified by the Word Resources Institute suggest increasing pressure on the savanna forests in the Cerrado region, a biodiversity-rich ecosystem. Additionally, while there are no official deforestation estimates in lowlands Bolivia, it has remained at high levels, according to <A href=""http://segamazonia.org/sites/default/files/press_releases/land_use_status_and_trends_in_amazonia.pdf"">Terra-I</A>. This suggests a need to examine the culprits.</P><P><STRONG>Don’t miss the forest for the trees</STRONG></P><P>The article mentioned above discusses a new report by the environmental campaign organization Mighty Earth that identifies deforestation in Brazil and Bolivia linked to Cargill and <mark>Bunge</mark>. Drawing on satellite imagery and supply-chain mapping information processed by the Stockholm Environment Institute, the article makes the case that new large-scale forest-clearing by Bolivian and Brazilian farmers for soybean production is associated with the demand from these two American-based food giants.</P><P>It is interesting to note that companies like Cargill and <mark>Bunge</mark> still buy soybeans originating from forestlands converted to agriculture and fail to implement due diligence procedures to verify their origin. In some cases, these purchases directly trigger soybean expansion across Brazil and Bolivia’s frontiers. Cargill and <mark>Bunge</mark> have argued, in their defense, that their role is minor, and that deforestation is a complex issue that requires all major buyers — not just them — to get involved.</P><P>While it is useful that environmental groups like Mighty Earth track how company supply chains are ‘contaminated’ by ‘dirty supply’, it would be more helpful if they could place these trends within a wider context. This would foster more practical and durable solutions, because even if these two soybean traders stopped buying soybeans from the Matopiba region in Brazil and the eastern lowlands in Bolivia, it is likely that deforestation would continue to expand in both of these regions.</P><DIV class=""short-image short-image--left""><A class=""fancybox-image GTMshortImage"" href=""http://forestsnews.cifor.org/28204/frontier-expansion-lessons-from-bolivia-and-para-brazil?fnl=en"" target=""_self""><DIV class=""short-image__title""><H4>Frontier expansion: Lessons from Bolivia and Pará, Brazil</H4></DIV></A></DIV><P>In this sense, the <EM>New York Times</EM> article fails to provide an in-depth understanding of the complex dynamics shaping these two agricultural frontiers, and misleadingly mixes two very different situations. Moreover, while the article refers to deforestation trends in the Amazon, it looks mostly at the Cerrado areas, where a greater pressure associated with agricultural expansion is taking place.</P><P>To its credit, the article does highlight two important trends that have been perceived by academics yet hardly studied until now: 1) Efforts to contain deforestation in the Amazon have shifted to the Cerrado areas; and 2) Efforts to contain deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon have placed pressure on other countries, mainly in Bolivia and Paraguay’s deciduous and dry forests. In these regions, different regulations governing conversion of forests apply less rigid standards than in the Amazon.</P><P>Two main issues came to my attention while reading this article. The first is the clear limits of the soy moratorium, since it only applies to the Amazon region. The second is how easy it remains for companies to circumvent their sustainability commitments when playing around with specific national regulations that still allow for forest conversion. But what is most interesting in our current times is that companies have to now face the reality of their own commitments under the scrutiny of civil society.</P><P>The two companies blamed as culprits of deforestation argue that they have a relatively low share in total soy supply originating from the regions under scrutiny. Cargill sources 8 percent from Bolivian municipalities and <mark>Bunge</mark> sources 20 percent from Matopiba, Brazil. Thus, slowing deforestation has to go beyond the actions of just these two companies. More action should be required to revise the land-use and forest conservation regulations in the Cerrado areas.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""short-image--fullwidth""><DIV class=""short-image--fullwidth__caption"">   An aerial shot shows the contrast between forest and agricultural landscapes near Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil. CIFOR Photo/Kate Evans </DIV></DIV><DIV class=""content""><DIV class=""container""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-md-9""><DIV class=""post-entry""><P><STRONG>Governments, not just companies, need to step up</STRONG></P><P>What I found thought-provoking in this article were the views expressed by Stewart Lindsay, <mark>Bunge</mark>’s vice president for global corporate affairs: “One company alone cannot solve this issue … a positive step would be for more companies to adopt zero-deforestation commitments, apply controls to block crops grown in illegally cleared areas from entering their supply chains, report publicly on progress, and invest millions of dollars to support <mark>sustainable</mark> land-use planning efforts.”</P><P>His perspective is correct, but it falls short. It is correct in the sense that deforestation is a complex issue that cannot be solved by one single company, especially as the largest share of deforestation is not necessarily driven by soy, but from pasture expansion, which the domestic markets absorb an important portion of. Pasture is still the largest source of deforestation in both <A href=""http://www.inpe.br/cra/projetos_pesquisas/terraclass2014.php"">Brazil</A> and <A href=""//www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/OccPapers/OP-108.pdf"">Bolivia</A>.</P><DIV class=""short-image short-image--left""><A class=""fancybox-image GTMshortImage"" href=""http://forestsnews.cifor.org/48912/improving-<mark>sustainable</mark>-cattle-production-in-the-brazilian-amazon?fnl=en"" target=""_self""><DIV class=""short-image__title""><H4>Improving <mark>sustainable</mark> cattle production in the Brazilian Amazon </H4></DIV></A></DIV><P>While it is important that the article highlights the pressure placed by Mennonites on forests for the production of soy sold to Cargill, much of the deforestation in lowlands Bolivia is currently related to the expansion of pasture for cattle production in the Chiquitania. This, of course, is not related to any transnational company, but to a growing national demand for beef associated with land speculation. Unfortunately, the government of Bolivia has not been able to adequately control this process.</P><P>Thus, institutional agreements between governments, industries and retailers in the domestic market have an important role to play in abating deforestation. Brazil is the poster child for this in terms of drastically reducing deforestation in the Amazon region. However, these agreements constitute a double-edged sword given the effects they can have on excluding certain suppliers like medium-scale farmers and smallholders who cannot adopt the improved production practices required by traders and end-buyers.</P><P>Something that is becoming more perverse in Brazil, and even more so in Bolivia, is that agricultural frontiers continue to expand under more complex land-use interactions. Over time, producers are facing more difficulties to keep yields and production volumes up, due to more intense and longer dry-spells caused by <mark>climate change</mark>. This is having adverse impacts on overall production, but banks and insurance systems often do not take into account <mark>climate change</mark>-related variables.</P><P>In addition, production models promoted by transnational trading companies and backed by environmental NGOs that tend to spare forests are resulting in the expansion of more intensive production systems based on large-scale and highly intensive use of chemical inputs. This is in opposition to more integrated and agro-ecological production systems that could take better advantage of the natural resources existing in the Amazon and Cerrado regions, and could better preserve them.</P><P>In conclusion, while it is important to continue discussing ways to achieve zero deforestation in supply chains with the help of traders and buyers, it is also important to look at the role of governments to provide guidance on clearer regulations and enforcement methods in ways that apply uniformly across different regions. More attention should be placed on innovative options to manage more <mark>sustainable</mark> agricultural frontiers, and to create schemes that answer the needs of all stakeholders involved.</P><DIV class=""short-link""><A class=""GTMshortLink"" href=""//www.cifor.org/library/5861/the-state-of-oil-palm-development-in-the-brazilian-amazon-trends-value-chain-dynamics-and-business-models/"" target=""_self""><SPAN class=""short-link__box""><SPAN>Read also</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""short-link__desc"">The state of oil palm development in the Brazilian Amazon: Trends, value chain dynamics, and business models</SPAN></A></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""post-entry""><DIV class=""extend_info""><DIV class=""contact_information"">For more information on this topic, please contact Pablo Pacheco at <A href=""mailto:p.pacheco@cgiar.org"">p.pacheco@cgiar.org</A>.</DIV><DIV class=""not_fta""> This research forms part of the <A href=""http://foreststreesagroforestry.org/"" target=""_blank"">CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry</A>, which is supported by <A href=""http://www.cgiar.org/our-funders/"" target=""_blank"">CGIAR Fund Donors</A>.</DIV></DIV><DIV class=""extend_info""><B>Copyright policy:</B>We want you to share Forests News content, which is licensed under Creative Commons <A href=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"" target=""_blank"">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)</A>.

	The palm oil industry is still a leading cause of deforestation in Indonesia. Three years after the world’s biggest palm oil traders adopted ‘no deforestation’ policies, Greenpeace International examined 11 traders to see how much progress they had made. Not only were they unable to prove their suppliers were not destroying rainforests, but most could not say when their supply chain would be deforestation-free.
</DIV></DIV><DIV><P>These findings will be met with alarm by household brands that use palm oil. Most brands, including the 400 companies in the Consumer Goods Forum, have committed to clean up their palm oil supply by 2020. Only two of the traders Greenpeace International assessed were planning to meet that deadline. The vast majority had no deadlines at all, leaving their customers with no way to stop dirty palm oil entering their products.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

Shares of the U.S. company surged, giving it a market value of $11.5 billion. <mark>Bunge</mark> later said it isn’t engaged in “business combination discussions” with Glencore or the company’s agriculture unit.</SPAN></P><FIGURE id=""attachment_181223"" style=""width: 830px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">A worker stands beside grain storage silos, operated by <mark>Bunge</mark> Ltd., at Nikolaev port in Nikolaev, Ukraine, on Wednesday, Aug. 31, 2016. Photographer: Vincent Mundy/Bloomberg</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">A combination, if it happens, would create one of the world’s largest agricultural traders, with assets in locations including Brazil, Australia, Russia and Canada. It would be a powerhouse in soybeans, wheat and sugar, with a large presence in the trade flows between Latin America and food importing nations such as China. The deal would also mean a sea change in an industry that for the past century has been dominated by the so-called ABCD quartet of Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., <mark>Bunge</mark>, Cargill Inc. and Louis Dreyfus Co.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">“It’s an acquisition for corporate strategy” rather than synergy, Steve Laveson, a portfolio manager for Becker Capital Management in Portland, Oregon, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. Becker owns more than 630,000 shares of <mark>Bunge</mark>.</SPAN></P><H4><STRONG>U.S. Hunt</STRONG></H4><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s no secret that Glencore, led by billionaire Ivan Glasenberg, has been on the hunt for assets in the U.S. grain industry. Glencore’s Chris Mahoney, who runs the agriculture unit, said in an interview with Bloomberg News published earlier this month that the company was having trouble finding “ willing sellers.” Within a day of those comments, <mark>Bunge</mark> Chief Executive Officer Soren Schroder indicated to analysts on an earnings conference call that his company would be open to participating in industry deals.</SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""twitter-tweet"" data-width=""550""><P lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">A Glencore deal for <mark>Bunge</mark> would make the Swiss mining giant a major player in the U.S. agriculture market<A href=""https://t.co/4egpDiZVJo"">https://t.co/4egpDiZVJo</A></P><P>— Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) <A href=""https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/867105403141795840"">May 23, 2017</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I think it’s very much ABCD and G now,” Mahoney, 58, said in the interview at his office in central Rotterdam, just inland from Europe’s biggest port. Glencore is already the world’s largest wheat trader and biggest merchant of pulses such as chickpeas.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">The deal would give Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore access to <mark>Bunge</mark>’s vast networks of trucks, barges and elevators, including infrastructure throughout North and South America. Almost 40 percent of <mark>Bunge</mark>’s long-terms assets are in Brazil, where Glencore has expanded through a purchase earlier this year of a sugar mill.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Glencore stock fell 1.1 percent to 288.85 pence by 8:07 a.m. in London, valuing the company at about $54 billion.</SPAN></P><H4><STRONG><mark>Bunge</mark> Shares</STRONG></H4><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shares of <mark>Bunge</mark> closed 17 percent higher at $81.70 Tuesday after Glencore confirmed its interest, the stock’s biggest gain since 2008. <mark>Bunge</mark>’s shares drifted to $78.95 in after-hours trading before <mark>Bunge</mark>’s statement saying it wasn’t in talks with Glencore.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">“<mark>Bunge</mark> is committed to continuing to execute its global agri-foods strategy and pursuing opportunities for driving growth and value creation,” the White Plains-based company said in the statement.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Glencore may have to pay more than $100 per share to buy <mark>Bunge</mark>, Vertical Research said in a report.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">“People look at us just like we look at everybody else every day,” Schroder said in an interview earlier this month. “I am not surprised. We are a very attractive company.”</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Several years of commodity price declines have helped spur the series of mega-deals currently reshaping the seed and chemical industry, including Bayer AG’s planned acquisition of Monsanto Co. and Dow Chemical Co.’s merger with DuPont Co.</SPAN></P><P> </P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">In contrast, the grain-handling industry has seen relatively little deal-making over the period. ADM stands out as the exception, with the Chicago-based company selling its stake in GrainCorp Ltd., eastern Australia’s largest grain handler, after its takeover bid was blocked.

Thanks to a growing niche, integrated landscape initiatives (ILIs) are able to access finance through mechanisms with primary objectives like agricultural productivity and food security, agro-forestry and renewable energy projects for <mark>climate</mark> mitigation, ecosystem services for <mark>climate</mark> adaptation, and <mark>sustainable</mark> development and Green Economy building. These eight case studies of financial institutions investing in ILM through targeted or multi-sector funding can act as a resource for landscapes seeking finance, investors seeking opportunities, and ILM finance mechanisms seeking to improve their efficiency.

Currently Althelia invests in <mark>climate</mark> resilience, food security, local development, and poverty alleviation – aiming to prove that financial institutions can be committed to environmental stewardship and social development while returning profit to investors. Althelia is working to align stakeholder interests, and develop new investment models to shape policies in the sectors of <mark>climate change</mark> and natural capital. In 2012, they announced the first closing of the Althelia <mark>Climate</mark> Fund, which focuses on certified <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture.</P><H5><mark>Bunge</mark> Environmental Markets</H5><H4>Addressing landscape inefficiencies through a value chain approach</H4><P><mark>Bunge</mark> is a leading global agribusiness food company, with integrated operations in over 40 countries at every step in the food chain. <mark>Bunge</mark>’s Financial Services Group develops emissions reduction projects in established and emerging markets through the <mark>Bunge</mark> Environmental Markets (BEM) program. BEM is intended to create economic incentives for green investment by developing and implementing emissions reduction projects for commercialization with companies and governments. At the Bajo Mira and Frontera Collective Territory in Colombia, BEM is working to scale up an existing agroforestry and conservation project for avoided emissions from deforestation in a way that is both environmentally and economically <mark>sustainable</mark>.</P><H5>EcoEnterprises Fund</H5><H4>Market barriers to transforming established businesses into environmental enterprises at scale</H4><P>For over 15 years, the EcoEnterprises Fund has been financing community-based <mark>sustainable</mark> businesses in Latin America, focusing on companies that have proven their ability to create healthy economic, social, and environmental landscapes where they operate. Their funds create small- to medium-sized <mark>sustainable</mark> ventures which operate in business niches including organic agriculture, non-timber forest products, <mark>sustainable</mark> forestry, and ecotourism. Their initial 10-year fund, Fondo EcoEmpresas, S.A., deployed USD 6.3 million in risk capital to 23 businesses in 10 countries. They are now launching their second fund, EcoEnterprises Partners II, LP (EcoE II), which has the potential to reach USD 35 million and will focus on taking EcoEnterprise’s activities to scale by providing expansion capital to business models that show promise for <mark>sustainable</mark> landscape management.</P><H5>Global Environment Facility (GEF)</H5><H4>Seeking synergies across convention siloes: Multiple benefits at scale through multi-focal area financing</H4><P>The GEF was established in 1992 as a public financial fund with a mandate to serve as the financial mechanism of major environmental conventions like the Convention on Biological Diversity, the United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. GEF is unique in its total focus on the protection of the global environment.

Moringa aims to provide returns to investors through revenue from food commodities for export, biomass, and timber, as well as credits for <mark>carbon</mark> and Payments for Ecosystem Services markets. They envision an agroforestry approach that acts in contrast to timber and <mark>carbon</mark> funds, providing diversified revenue streams from a range of local and international markets. The diversification of agroforestry projects provides a favorable risk/return profile, given global economic and environmental market uncertainties and deforestation in high-yield tropical forested areas.</P><H5>Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD)</H5><H4>Enabling investments for REDD+ through funding programmes to address <mark>climate</mark>, conservation, deforestation and livelihoods at the landscape level</H4><P>NORAD is focused on empowering countries that receive funding to achieve their own development goals to reduce global poverty.  Norway’s programs concentrate on five key areas: <mark>sustainable</mark> management of biodiversity and resources, <mark>climate change</mark> and clean energy access, water resources management, water and sanitation, and hazardous substances. Funds like Clean Energy for Development, the <mark>Climate</mark> and Forest Support Initiative, and the <mark>Climate</mark> and Forest Funding Scheme for Civil Society focus on environmental and <mark>climate</mark> challenges in the Global South.</P><H5>World Bank Bio<mark>Carbon</mark> Fund</H5><H4>Creating multiple revenue streams from the <mark>sustainable</mark> transformation of landscapes</H4><P>The Bio<mark>Carbon</mark> Fund was the first <mark>carbon</mark> fund to focus on emission reductions from land use, land-use change and forestry sector.

It has had some success on both counts—some would argue too much on the second.</P><P>A <mark>carbon</mark> price now exists, established by the European Emissions-Trading Scheme (<SPAN class=""scaps"">ETS</SPAN>). In its first phase it has been volatile (see chart 2) because information about Europe's industrial emissions was poor, so the market got a shock in early 2006 when it emerged that the European Commission had been too generous with the allowances it handed out to industry. Phase one allowances (2005-08) are now virtually worthless. But the commission has learnt its lesson and got meaner with allowances, thus pushing up the price in phase two.</P><P>The supply of <mark>carbon</mark> credits comes principally from two sources. The first is the allowances given to companies in the five dirty industries covered by the <SPAN class=""scaps"">ETS</SPAN> (electricity, oil, metals, building materials and paper). The second source of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide lies outside Europe. The European Commission linked the <SPAN class=""scaps"">ETS</SPAN> to the “clean-development mechanism” (<SPAN class=""scaps"">CDM</SPAN>) set up under the Kyoto protocol. This provides for emissions reductions in developing countries—such as those on the Latin American pig farms—to be certified by the <SPAN class=""scaps"">UN</SPAN>. Such “certified emissions reductions” (<SPAN class=""scaps"">CER</SPAN>) can then be sold.</P><P>The demand for <mark>carbon</mark> credits comes mostly from within the <SPAN class=""scaps"">ETS</SPAN>, from polluters who need certificates allowing them to emit <mark>carbon</mark>. There is some demand from Japan, which has a voluntary scheme, and from companies and individuals elsewhere in the world who want to offset their emissions for moral reasons, or to make themselves look good.</P><P>The trade is now sizeable. Some €22.5 billion-worth ($30.4 billion) of allowances were traded last year, according to Point <mark>Carbon</mark>, a data-provider, representing 1.6 billion tonnes of CO<SUB>2</SUB>—a huge increase on the €9.4 billion traded in 2005. Europe's <SPAN class=""scaps"">ETS</SPAN> made up about 80% of the total value. </P><P>Developing-country <SPAN class=""scaps"">CER</SPAN>s accounted for about €4 billion of last year's trade: 562m tonnes of CO<SUB>2</SUB>. According to New <mark>Carbon</mark> Finance, a research company, <mark>carbon</mark> funds worth $11.8 billion have been raised so far. Half of that total is managed from London. <mark>Climate Change</mark> Capital, a niche investment bank, raised $130m for its first <mark>carbon</mark> fund, launched in July 2005; its second, launched a year later, is now worth around $1 billion. According to Tony White of <mark>Climate Change</mark> Capital, all the money for the first came from hedge funds, which like risk. By the time the second fund was established, more cautious investors, such as pension funds and banks, were prepared to put money into it. </P><P>The money has gone mostly into projects in developing countries to produce <SPAN class=""scaps"">CER</SPAN>s. <mark>Bunge</mark>'s Brazilian pig-farmers are making <SPAN class=""scaps"">CER</SPAN>s out of their animals' effluent. But the bulk of the investment has gone into greenhouse-gas capture in China. </P><H2>Cheap and cheerful</H2><P>The most potent greenhouse gas is <SPAN class=""scaps"">HFC</SPAN>-23, a by-product of <SPAN class=""scaps"">HCFC</SPAN>-22, a chemical used in, among other things, fridges. It is now mostly banned in the developed world. Its global-warming effect is, tonne for tonne, 11,700 times greater than that of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, so it is good to get rid of it, and cheap, too; capturing it and burning it off costs less than €1 for the equivalent of one tonne of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. These days China produces most of the world's <SPAN class=""scaps"">HFC</SPAN>-23. That—along with the fact that the Chinese government is efficient to deal with—explains why 53% of the total volume of <SPAN class=""scaps"">CDM</SPAN> projects in 2006—worth around €3.5 billion in total—went to China. </P><P>The very cheapness of cutting emissions of <SPAN class=""scaps"">HFC</SPAN>-23 makes the trade controversial. Credits costing less than €1 to produce have been sold on the market for up to €11. Factories have found that their damaging by-product, <SPAN class=""scaps"">HFC</SPAN>-23, can be more valuable than their main output. The Chinese government, realising how much money there is in this business, has imposed a tax of 65% on revenues from it, and in February this year it launched its own $2 billion <SPAN class=""scaps"">CDM</SPAN> fund. So European consumers, who are paying for greenhouse-gas abatement through their electricity and other bills, are contributing billions of dollars to the Chinese government's coffers via the <SPAN class=""scaps"">CDM</SPAN>.</P><P>Easy options—<SPAN class=""scaps"">HFC</SPAN>-23 and other fabulously dirty (ie, profitable) industrial gases—will soon run out. Guy Turner at New <mark>Carbon</mark> Finance reckons that the days of the <SPAN class=""scaps"">CER</SPAN> that costs less than €1 to produce are over, and that the range is now more like €1-5. But there is plenty of scope at that level. China's industrialisation is a fast and dirty business, and there will be no shortage of greenhouse gases produced there for rich-country money to clean up.</P><P>That is part of the problem. Of the 65% of companies surveyed by Point <mark>Carbon</mark> earlier this year which claimed that the <SPAN class=""scaps"">ETS</SPAN> had led them to abate their emissions (up from 15% the previous year), most were planning to buy credits rather than cut their own emissions. Yet the <SPAN class=""scaps"">ETS</SPAN> was intended to cut European emissions as well as Chinese ones.</P><P>This is happening on a small scale. At times the <mark>carbon</mark> price has made it worth power companies' while to switch from dirty fuels to cleaner gas. “We massively reduced our lignite production when the CO<SUB>2</SUB> price was at its height,” says Alfred Hoffmann, head of portfolio management in Scandinavia and Germany for Vattenfall, a Swedish power company. Lignite is dirtier than black coal. But then gas prices rose, making switching less attractive.</P><DIV class=""content-image-float clearfix"" style=""width: 300px;""><SPAN class=""caption"">Bringing home the methane</SPAN><SPAN class=""credit"">FLPA</SPAN></DIV><P>The <mark>carbon</mark> price has delivered some of the <mark>innovation</mark> that it was supposed to generate. Shell, for instance, is pumping CO<SUB>2</SUB> from a refinery in the Botlek area of the Netherlands into 500 greenhouses producing fruit and vegetables, thus avoiding emissions of 170,000 tonnes of CO<SUB>2</SUB> a year and saving the greenhouse owners from having to burn 95m cubic metres of gas to produce the CO<SUB>2</SUB> they need. </P><P>Alcan, an aluminium company, is planning to use the heat from one of its smelters to increase the efficiency of its power-generation plant at Lynemouth in Northumberland in Britain. Wyn Jones, managing director of Alcan's British smelting and power-generation operations, says this will save 150,000 tonnes of CO<SUB>2</SUB> a year (€3m if the price of CO<SUB>2</SUB> is around €20 a tonne, as Alcan expects) and 60,000 tonnes of coal (£2.1m, or $4.2m, at around £35 a tonne). He is not sure how much the project will cost, but is reckoning on a payback period of around five years.</P><P>But European emissions overall are not falling, which suggests there may not be as much switching out of coal, or as much technological <mark>innovation</mark>, as had been hoped. Chinese <SPAN class=""scaps"">CER</SPAN>s are too cheap and the <mark>carbon</mark> price is too low and too volatile. Even when it was bouncing around at €15-25, it did not seem to encourage much new investment. According to Bjoern Urdal of <mark>Sustainable</mark> Asset Management, who took a detailed look at the effects of the <mark>carbon</mark> price on the German electricity market last year, replacing old coal-fired power stations with gas-fired ones became worthwhile only at a <mark>carbon</mark> price of €33. He has not done the sums since last November, when the European Commission chucked out Germany's “transfer rule” (which would have exempted new coal-fired stations from the <SPAN class=""scaps"">ETS</SPAN> for 14 years), but reckons the break-even point will have come down to more like €25.</P><P>That helped raise the <mark>carbon</mark> price. So did the commission's decision to slash national governments' planned allocations to industry for the period 2008-12. The price of phase two allowances has risen to a level high enough to get some power generators to switch from coal to gas at the margin when the gas price is moderate; but not high enough to get them to replace coal-fired power stations with gas-fired ones—nor to encourage much of the <mark>innovation</mark> that <mark>carbon</mark> trading had been expected to spawn. </P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

For example:</P><UL><LI>In Vietnam, rice production has decreased because of saline intrusion in the soil due to rising sea levels.</LI><LI>In West African countries in or near the Sahel, decreases in growing areas are projected for 70 per cent of crops by 2050, and by more than 50 per cent in the case of bananas, maize and beans.</LI><LI>In Nicaragua, <mark>climate change</mark> has contributed to stagnating yields for maize and beans, while drought and heavy rain have led to crop losses.</LI></UL><P>Across the world, farmers face decreasing yields and need larger areas for production, forcing the price of commodities to rise. A new study on the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, which as of 2013 supplied 10 per cent of the world’s soybeans, found that a temperature increase of 1°C will lead to a 9–13 per cent decrease in soy and maize production, largely due to farmers putting less land into production or only planting one crop at a time.</P><P>The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report showed that <mark>climate change</mark>s over the past 30 years have already reduced global agricultural production in the range of 1–5 per cent.</P><P>Higher temperatures will increase heat stress among livestock and, where combined with decreases in precipitation, will reduce the amount of water available for irrigation. The increase in the frequency and/or severity of extreme weather events will be particularly damaging to smallscale farmers and people living in or at risk of poverty, because they generally lack access to social safety nets.</P><P>Price volatility is especially damaging to small-scale food producers, whether prices are too low when harvests are good or too high in times of scarcity and when disaster strikes. Any decreases in production in such circumstances affect both levels of income and food consumption.</P><P>Oxfam’s experience shows that when farmers lose income they often resort to selling assets such as livestock, taking children out of school or cutting down on medical expenses. Without a safety net, small-scale farmers and their families lose the ability to achieve a decent livelihood or invest in their farm’s future, and are more likely to experience malnutrition and hunger.</P><P>Women farmers are more vulnerable to <mark>climate change</mark> impacts than men because they are often more dependent on <mark>climate</mark>-sensitive livelihoods such as rainfed agriculture and collecting water for household use. They also have unequal access to productive resources such as land and agricultural inputs, and have less of a support system to fall back on in times of crisis.</P><P>In countries where a significant proportion of household budgets are spent on food and many people are dependent on agriculture, the social and economic consequences of <mark>climate</mark>-related production changes and price shocks can have disastrous implications for the wider economy.</P><P>These increased risks faced by small-scale food producers are increasingly reflected in the bottom lines of the world’s biggest food and beverage companies too. For example, in 2010 – a year of extreme weather in many parts of the world – several companies experienced production shocks and financial losses that could be attributed to the changing <mark>climate</mark>:</P><UL><LI>Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. faced a $9m loss due to heavy rains and flooding in Guatemala, which affected banana production.</LI><LI>The global commodity trading firm <mark>Bunge</mark> reported a $56m loss in its sugar and bioenergy business due to drought.</LI><LI>Severe droughts in Russia led the country to ban wheat exports, which created a disastrous ripple across global stock markets and prompted a 2.2 per cent drop in the share price of General Mills.</LI></UL><P><EM>Suhardiyoto Haryadi is a professor of foresry at the Center for Biodiversity and Tropical Forest Rehabilitation, Bogor Agricultural University (IPB).</EM></P><P><EM>This article was published with permission from <A href=""http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/articles/14979/"" target=""_blank"">Ecosystem Marketplace</A>.

technology, Mario Augusto <mark>Bunge</mark> was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1919 and educated at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata, receiving his Ph.D. in physics in 1952. He did research work in and taught theoretical physics in Argentina before moving to the United States in 1960, where he taught at several universities, including the University of Pennsylvania, Texas, Delaware, and Temple University. He moved to Montreal in 1966, where he remains and has been Frothingham Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at McGill University since 1981. <mark>Bunge</mark> insists on describing both science and technology exactly as they are. His pioneering approach to the philosophy of technology includes a clear characterization of all the components of technological systems in systems-theory terms, including their value commitments and relationships to other institutions. Outspokenly critical of what he views as pseudo-science, including psychoanalysis, <mark>Bunge</mark> is equally strong in his defenses of democracy, although he also sees it as subject to much abuse.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""vertical_module_list_row""><H3 class=""about_title"">Бібліографічна інформація</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

(Photo by Carissa <mark>Bunge</mark>, American Geophysical Union)</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><H5><EM>Amy Nussbaum, ASA Science Policy Fellow</EM></H5><P>On March 21, statisticians Peter Bloomfield, Noel Cressie, Dorit Hammerling, and Leonard Smith joined 23 other scientists from 13 scientific societies on Capitol Hill for the 7th annual <mark>Climate</mark> Science Day (CSD). Sponsored by the ASA and other scientific societies, the event puts scientists in the same room as lawmakers and their staffs for frank discussions about <mark>climate</mark> science research. ASA CSD participants visited Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Ohio offices, as well as various committee and EPA staff members. </P><P>As in past years, messages were targeted to possible effects of <mark>climate change</mark> in specific districts—for instance, drought in the southeast or increased instances of other extreme events. By using such examples, CSD participants hoped to emphasize that <mark>climate</mark> science affects many people in many ways all over the country. In addition, policy conversations were avoided, giving the science a chance to shine.</P><P>CSD participants note the tone of the meetings has been changing over the years. Many of the meetings were positive, and more staffers seem to acknowledge the human role in <mark>climate change</mark>. According to Leonard Smith of the London School of Economics and Pembroke College, Oxford, and the only participant to have attended all seven <mark>Climate</mark> Science Days, the reception felt much different, especially compared to seven years ago. “The desire for open, honest, transparent information on <mark>climate</mark> is like nothing I have ever seen on Capitol Hill before,” he says. “The Republican <mark>Climate</mark> Resolution (H. Res. 195), the bipartisan <A href=""http://citizens<mark>climate</mark>lobby.org/<mark>climate</mark>-solutions-caucus/""><mark>Climate</mark> Solutions Caucus</A>, and the healthy disagreement between republican offices on <mark>climate</mark> issues each evidence a willingness for more open discussion,” Smith continued. “For CSD participants and the greater scientific community, these developments open new doors for science to inform. As a Gator, I’m also proud of the lead that Florida republicans are taking on the CSC and H.Res. 195.” </P><P>Participant Dorit Hammerling of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, says, “I was impressed by the interest and knowledge of the staffers, as well as the generally congenial atmosphere of the meetings.” Hammerling and her team visited the office of Rep. Coffman (R-CO), whose staffers seemed particularly curious and open-minded. In the week following <mark>Climate</mark> Science Day, Rep. Coffman joined the bipartisan <mark>Climate</mark> Solutions Caucus with Rep. Annie Kuster (D-NH), indicating a true interest in the quality of the environment and solutions to current problems. </P><P>Noel Cressie, formerly of The Ohio State University and now at the University of Wollongong in Australia, says, “My pitch was to be a resource for them in matters of the environment and <mark>climate</mark>-change impacts, which I think is how we can make a real difference.” </P><P>Content-wise, the meetings varied widely. Peter Bloomfield of North Carolina State University was paired with a state climatologist and noted that some of the people really responded to the climatology side and weather effects in the short run, while others responded to the global aspect of <mark>climate</mark> science. One staff member asked about the provenance and reliability of <mark>climate change</mark> data, leading to a fruitful discussion. Still others recognized the impact of <mark>climate</mark> events on their home districts and saw that scientists can be counted among their allies when it comes to finding solutions to new problems. </P><P>A workshop held on the previous afternoon featured Rep. Bill Foster (IL), the only PhD physicist in Congress, and former Rep. Bob Inglis (SC), now an outspoken champion for <mark>climate</mark> science. These perspectives were especially helpful for participants. Smith says, “I was particularly struck by Congressman Bob Inglis’ plea that scientists, as individuals, ‘do not become an advocate,’ lest we undermine our credibility. This resonates with my experience and with my personal aims regarding the ‘science to inform’/ ‘science to motivate’ divide.”</P><P>Other events included a congressional staff briefing and Q&amp;A session and presentations with advice for a successful Hill meeting. Participants were able to meet with their assigned teams, strategize, and develop their message and ask based on the offices they would be visiting.  </P></DIV><DIV id=""tools""><DIV style=""float:right;display:block;""><DIV id=""post-ratings-46423"" class=""post-ratings"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Article"" data-nonce=""504364e862""> (No Ratings Yet)</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The report, “The Ultimate Mystery Meat,” reveals the secrets about where the feed for Burger King’s chicken, bacon, and beef come from, and shows that these companies are linked to massive, systematic deforestation to clear sloth and jaguar habitat in Latin America.</P><P> </P><P>Using satellite mapping, Mighty and RFN identified areas of recent deforestation for soy in Latin America that were connected to Cargill and <mark>Bunge</mark>. The field investigation focused on both the Brazilian Cerrado, a vast forested savanna region in Brazil, and the Amazon basin lowlands in Bolivia. The investigative team visited 28 locations across the Cerrado and Amazon basin, covering more than 3,000 kilometers, to document the origins of the soy that feeds the world’s cattle, chicken, and pigs. The team captured extensive aerial drone videos and photos that documented rapid clearing of some of the world’s last intact forests and savannas, including through systematic burning.</P><P>The videos, photos and findings are available at <A href=""http://www.mightyearth.org/mysterymeat"">www.mightyearth.org/mysterymeat</A>; high-resolution photos and videos from the investigation are available for <A href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/aa66gmh1udm5b1z/AAAr7S6CtYo6wFeE2HT5t-Uka?dl=0"">download</A> and use.</P><P> </P><P>Burger King does not make its suppliers public nor provide any substantial information about the origins of its Whoppers, chicken sandwiches, or pork products. While Burger King is far from the only company with serious environmental issues in its supply chain, it substantially lags behind its largest competitor, McDonald’s, in environmental and social requirements for its raw materials. Burger King earned a score of zero in the Union of Concerned Scientists’ recent <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2016/09/ucs-beef-scorecard-company-scores-2016.pdf"">rankings</A> of fast food companies.</P><P>“Burger King hamburgers are the ultimate mystery meat,” said Mighty Earth Campaign Director Kristin Urquiza. “We set out to find where they come from, and what we saw wasn’t pretty. Burger King is ruling over a kingdom of deforestation.”</P><P> </P><P>In the Cerrado alone, the investigation found that the areas in which <mark>Bunge</mark> operates saw 567,562 hectares of land deforested from 2011 to 2015. Cargill operates in areas of the Cerrado with about 130,000 hectares of deforestation over that same five-year period. While not all of this deforestation was for soy, Cargill and <mark>Bunge</mark> have provided financing and infrastructure that has opened up many of these regions to deforestation for different commodities. More than half the Cerrado has already been destroyed, primarily for soy and cattle. The investigation also found that Cargill is a leading driver of deforestation in Bolivia, one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. Bolivia has in recent years become an international epicenter for soy clearance.</P><P> </P><P>“Burger King lacks policies to ensure that the food they sell does not contribute to forest destruction. This is unacceptable. They don’t even seem to care,” said Nils Hermann Ranum, head of policy and campaigns at Rainforest Foundation Norway.</P><P> </P><P>About three quarters of the world’s soy goes to animal feed for meat and dairy production. More than one million square kilometers of our planet – equivalent to the total combined area of France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands – are dedicated to growing soy. Most soy is grown for animal feed, which ultimately makes its way into the mouths of livestock sold in Europe, China, and the United States.</P><P> </P><P>Cargill and <mark>Bunge</mark> sell soy used for the animal feed that meat producers use to raise the livestock that goes into burgers, chicken nuggets, hot dogs and other meat products. Burger King is the world’s second largest hamburger chain, and operates in approximately 100 countries with more than 15,000 restaurants; it is also part of a family of companies controlled by the conglomerate 3G Capital that includes Anheuser Busch InBev, Kraft Heinz, and Tim Hortons.</P><P> </P><P>“Burger King is one of the world’s largest fast food companies, but consistently ranks last in the industry when it comes to environmental protection policies. The fast food giant needs to follow its competitors like McDonald’s and demand that its suppliers are not destroying tropical forests as part of their business model,” said Sharon Smith of the Union of Concerned Scientists.</P><P> </P><P>Burger King and its suppliers have an enormous opportunity to make a positive contribution to protecting the environment and indigenous communities. Mighty and RFN are calling on Burger King to:</P><P> </P><UL><LI>Follow the lead of its competitors in the fast food industry by adopting and implementing a strong “No Deforestation, No Exploitation” policy;</LI><LI>Publish its suppliers and report on their compliance with sustainability policies;</LI><LI>Join McDonald’s, Carrefour, and others in supporting the expansion of Brazil’s highly successful moratorium on Amazon deforestation to the Brazilian Cerrado and other countries in Latin America; and,</LI><LI>Work with governments, communities, and civil society to support broader improvements in forest governance and <mark>sustainable</mark> agricultural expansion by expanding successful zero-deforestation industry models to these at-risk ecosystems.</LI></UL><P> </P><P>“Burger King, Cargill, <mark>Bunge</mark> and other companies have a unique opportunity to end the era of deforestation in Latin America, and to help move the world towards a vision of <mark>sustainable</mark> food.

In order to be effective, future forest conservation policies should include measures targeting both producers (the supply side) and consumers (the demand side) to address commodity-driven deforestation. Whereas the UN Conventions on Biodiversity (CBD) and <mark>Climate Change</mark> (UNFCCC) do not make reference to this driving factor, here we explore whether and how recent national strategies by member states to the Conventions acknowledge the role of agricultural commodities in tropical deforestation. A text analysis of 139 Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation and 132 National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) shows that the general trade-off between national development aspirations and forest conservation is commonly acknowledged. However, only few strategies link deforestation to commodity production and consumption, whereas most documents do not mention this topic. This lack of reference to a key driver of tropical deforestation limits the prospects of safeguarding tropical forests for biodiversity and <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation purposes as part of the two UN Conventions, and might jeopardise their overall effectiveness.</P><P id=""spar0040"">These findings were complemented by a content analysis of INDCs, NBSAPs and REDD+ documents from eight case countries affected by commodity-driven deforestation. We investigated whether this driver is acknowledged in the national strategies, and which policy measures are suggested to address forest loss from agricultural commodities. We found that six case countries mention agricultural commodities as deforestation driver in their REDD+ documents, whereas the biodiversity and <mark>climate change</mark> strategies were silent on the topic. Policy measures targeting commodity production were suggested in four REDD+ strategies, ranging from incentive payments, <mark>sustainable</mark> agricultural practices and land-use planning to demand-side approaches such as certification and the promotion of <mark>sustainable</mark> lifestyles.</P><P id=""spar0045"">One conclusion from this exercise is that UN member states seem not to consider <mark>climate</mark> and biodiversity national plans the adequate forum to discuss detailed forest conservation approaches. We argue that in order to increase effectiveness, strategies under the UN Conventions should take commodity-driven deforestation into account, through measures that address both the producer and the consumer side.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><UL class=""issue-navigation"" id=""issue-navigation""><LI class=""previous""><BUTTON class=""button-alternative button-alternative-tertiary"" disabled="""" type=""button""><SPAN class=""button-alternative-text""><SPAN><STRONG>Previous </STRONG>article<SPAN class=""extra-detail""> in issue</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></BUTTON></LI></UL></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

With so much secrecy surrounding the talks, Greenpeace says, it has been impossible for analysts to assess properly the impact the deal will have on Mercosur nations. And now, as the accord nears finalization, there is little time left for public comment or input.</P><P>The leaked documents show that both trade blocs are seeking to maximize market access while also increasing exports. The European Union’s focus is on exporting financial services to Mercosur countries, and gaining market access for energy companies, cars, motor parts and beverages, among other businesses. The EU wants European companies to be able to bid on procurement contracts at the local level, including contracts with big municipalities and federal states. The Mercosur countries want easier access for their exports, largely agricultural goods, to a large and wealthy EU market of about 250 million consumers.</P><P>Although being presented as a win-win deal that benefits both sides, the agreement is controversial.</P><P>EU farmers are enraged by what they see as a double standard.

The leaked documents reveal an agreement with <A href=""http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2017/april/tradoc_155481.pdf"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external"">a chapter on trade and <mark>sustainable</mark> development</A>.

Negotiations began in 2000 but were suspended in 2004 after substantial differences emerged between the parties concerning the level of liberalization of trade in agricultural goods, services and public procurement markets. With progressive governments in power in much of South America, many analysts thought the deal was dead.</P><P>But the talks gained momentum in 2016, after Mercosur governments lurched to the right politically, with progressive presidents voted out of power or impeached.

Deforestation, research shows, contributes about 15 percent of global emissions each year, the same amount released by all forms of transportation.</P><P>Every year, CDP asks more than 800 of the world's largest, forest-dependent companies to voluntarily disclose information about deforestation in their supply chains. This year 21 percent, or 201, of them did, compared to 180 last year. Notably, two of the world's biggest commodity companies—Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and <mark>Bunge</mark>—responded to CDP's request for the first time.</P><P>&quot;We're seeing the numbers grow every year,&quot; said Katie McCoy, head of CDP's forest program. &quot;We're in an age where people are asking companies to be more transparent and there's increasing scrutiny from investors.&quot;</P><P>CDP generated the report at the request of 365 investment firms, representing more than $22 trillion in assets, that wanted to know how companies are managing deforestation risks from the four primary forest-destroying commodities: palm, timber, soy and cattle. The corporations that responded to CDP range across industries, including textiles, cosmetics, food retail, agriculture and media.</P><P>Investors, lenders and regulators are increasingly asking companies to report on how they will manage <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/<mark>climate</mark>-change""><mark>climate</mark></A> risks, pushing for greater transparency in commodity supply chains—something many companies have been historically reluctant to do. Now, though, they're being pushed.</P><P>Next week, the <A href=""https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/"">Task Force on <mark>Climate</mark>-Related Financial Disclosures</A>, chaired by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is set to issue its first report, with recommendations on how global companies should disclose <mark>climate</mark>-related risk.</P><P>CDP and other groups are also stressing to corporations that they'll face shaky futures if they don't address deforestation.</P><P>The companies that responded to CDP this year said that, on average, 24 percent of their revenues depended on the four biggest forest-risk commodities. CDP calculated that deforestation risk jeopardizes as much as $906 billion in investment turnover a year.  </P><P>Most of the companies—72 percent—said they were confident they had adequate supplies of those commodities. But CDP said that figure reflected an overly rosy outlook. More than 80 percent of agricultural companies, for example, have already had to adapt to deforestation risk or take revenue hits because of it, CDP found.</P><P>&quot;That confidence may be misplaced, given the data we've analyzed,&quot; McCoy said. &quot;Eighty percent of agricultural producers have already felt an impact.&quot;</P><P>Meanwhile, CDP found, only one out of five companies had assessed deforestation risks beyond a six-year horizon, and fewer than half had looked at how the availability of commodities could impact their future growth.</P><P>With the growing awareness of the damaging impacts of palm oil production, consumers began to demand products without palm oil in the marketplace. That forced manufacturers and retailers to seek out certifications or on-package verifications that goods were produced without deforestation or sustainably. Increasingly, though to a lesser extent, they're starting to demand that for the other forest-damaging commodities.</P><P>Now the world's biggest commodity companies—ADM, <mark>Bunge</mark>, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus, collectively known as the ABCD companies—are feeling the push for transparency more strongly than ever.</P><P>The four companies control as much as <A href=""https://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/rr-cereal-secrets-grain-traders-agriculture-30082012-en.pdf"">90 percent</A> of the world's grain trade and wield enormous influence up and down the supply chain, providing the raw materials that end up in a vast array of consumer products.</P><P>Cargill, the world's largest privately held company, began disclosing information to CDP in 2014. ADM and <mark>Bunge</mark> did so this year, in response to shareholder resolutions that asked the companies to report on their progress toward deforestation goals.</P><P>But the increasing transparency and disclosure has yet to translate into meaningful reductions in deforestation. The Brazilian <A href=""http://sports.yahoo.com/news/deforestation-brazil-rises-almost-30-percent-202101311.html"">government said</A> last week that deforestation in the Amazon rainforest grew by 30 percent over the past year. <mark>Climate</mark> scientists say that preserving the Amazon, which absorbs <A href=""http://www.livescience.com/44235-amazon-rainforest-<mark>carbon</mark>-cycle-measured.html"">2.2 billion </A> tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide a year, is a key tool for controlling <mark>climate change</mark>. Similar deforestation rates have continued in other critical forest areas of south Asia, including Indonesia and Malaysia.</P><P>Many predict the pressure will continue to mount, especially as targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement loom. According to CDP and We Mean Business, a coalition working to transition companies to low-<mark>carbon</mark> operations, businesses could cut nearly 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, 10 percent, or as much as 1.2 billion metric tons, by reducing deforestation.  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""tagged-with""><LABEL>Published Under:</LABEL></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The first part deals with philosophies that have had a significant input, positive or negative, on the search for truth; it suggests that scientific and technological are either stimulated or smothered by a philosophical matrix; and it outlines two ontological doctrines believed to have nurtured research in modern times: systemism (not to be mistaken for holism) and materialism (as an extension of physicalism).
 
The second part discusses a few practical problems that are being actively discussed in the literature, from climatology and information science to
economics and legal philosophy. This discussion is informed by the general principles analyzed in the first part of the book. Some of the conclusions are that standard economic theory is just as inadequate as Marxism; that law and order are weak without justice; and that the central equation of normative climatology is a tautology–which of course does not put <mark>climate change</mark> in doubt.
 
The third and final part of the book tackles a set of key concepts, such as those of indicator, energy, and existence, that have been either taken for granted or neglected. For instance, it is argued that there is at least one existence predicate, and that it is unrelated to the so-called existential quantifier; that high level hypotheses cannot be put to the test unless conjoined with indicator hypotheses; and that induction cannot produce high level hypotheses because empirical data do not contain any transempirical concepts. Realism, materialism, and systemism 
are thus refined and vindicated.

</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P>However, there is a risk that these technologies blind us to the very real problems facing modern agriculture – problems that are rapidly undermining the previous round of technological advances.</P><P>While global crop yields rose rapidly in the early decades of the “green revolution”, productivity is now plateauing in many regions of the world. A <A href=""http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2296"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">2012 meta-study</A> found that in 24%-39% of areas growing maize, rice, wheat and soybean, yields either failed to improve, stagnated after initial gains, or collapsed.</P><P>Only slightly more than half of all global rice and wheat areas (57% and 56% respectively) are still experiencing yield increases. The areas where yields have stagnated include some of the wealthiest, most industrialised and most hi-tech production systems: more than one-third of the wheat crop in the US (mostly in the Great Plains) is affected, along with more than a third of the Argentine wheat crop, and harvests all across Europe.</P><P>Meanwhile, rice yields are plateauing in California and most European rice-growing areas. This trend is also evident in some 80% of rice crops in China and Indonesia – two of the world’s major rice producers. Worryingly, this may only be the tip of the iceberg. </P><P>The reason the productivity of industrial agriculture is now under threat is because it has been systematically degrading the human and natural capital on which it relies. Pests, viruses, fungi, bacteria and weeds are adapting to chemical pest management faster than ever: <A href=""http://www.springer.com/la/book/9789400777958"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">210 species of herbicide-resistant weeds</A> have been <A href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286056270_Herbicide_Resistant_Weeds"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">identified</A>. Meanwhile, synthetic fertilisers are fast destroying the soil biota and its nutrient-recycling potential. This creates a dangerous treadmill effect: increasing resistance leads to increasing pesticide use, generating mounting costs for farmers and further environmental degradation. This in turn requires additional doses of nutrient application to keep squeezing productivity out of the soils.</P><P>Meanwhile, food systems are responsible for up to <A href=""http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-environ-020411-130608"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">29% of global greenhouse gas emissions</A> – and are therefore driving the <mark>climate</mark> instability that is itself the greatest threat to future agricultural productivity. A major chunk of these emissions come from large-scale monocultures and industrial animal feedlots in the global north, and from the loss of <mark>carbon</mark> sinks in the global south as land is cleared – often to make way for maize and soybean monocultures to export as animal feed.</P><P>Recent crop-breeding <mark>innovation</mark>s may be impressive, but they do not hold answers to the most pressing question: namely, how to move away from industrial monocultures and the inevitable damage and vulnerability they bring. One <A href=""http://phys.org/news/2016-12-bowl-devastate-today-crops.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">new study</A> suggests that a repeat of the Dust Bowl conditions of the 1930s – increasingly likely in a context of <mark>climate change</mark> – would wipe out 40% of US maize and soy crops, and 30% of wheat. What matters most is resilience. And resilience cannot be delivered without rethinking the fundamental principles of our food and farming systems.</P><P>The risk is that new technologies simply give industrial agriculture a new lease of life and delay the inevitable shift to a fundamentally different model of agriculture.</P><P>A viable alternative exists in the shape of diversified agro-ecological systems. In other words, diversifying farms and farming landscapes – replacing synthetic chemical inputs, optimising biodiversity and stimulating interactions between different species, as part of holistic and regenerative strategies to build long-term soil fertility, healthy agro-ecosystems and secure livelihoods.</P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-2 | 2""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">Southern Africa cries for help as El Niño and <mark>climate change</mark> savage maize harvest</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

We are told that the opponents of industrial agriculture want to eschew technological advance and keep developing regions mired in non-mechanised, subsistence-style agriculture. However, this is a false dichotomy. </P><P>A transition to diversified agro-ecological systems is needed, whether the starting point is industrial agriculture or subsistence-style farming. Moreover, the agro-ecological alternative is hi-tech and knowledge intensive– it requires complex synergies to be built and sustained between different crop varieties and species, and between different farming systems (mixed crop-livestock systems, for instance).</P><P>The growing body of evidence <A href=""http://www.ipes-food.org/images/Reports/UniformityToDiversity_FullReport.pdf"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">reviewed by the International Panel of Experts on <mark>Sustainable</mark> Food Systems</A> (iPES-Food) shows the huge potential of these systems to succeed where industrial systems are failing – namely in reconciling concerns such as food security, environmental and livelihood resilience, nutritional adequacy and social equity.</P><P>Crucially, where diversified systems raise productivity and improve livelihoods, they do so durably, performing particularly well under environmental stress and delivering production increases in the places where additional food is desperately needed. For example, the agro-ecological <A href=""http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">system of rise intensification</A> approach is securing and increasing rice yields around the world, while “<A href=""http://push-pull.net"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">push-pull” systems</A> – controlling pests by pushing them away with repellent plants or pulling them towards decoy crops – are doubling and trebling maize production in Africa.</P><P>The social change that so often accompanies this shift paves the way for revaluing local farming within new and often shorter supply chains, providing vulnerable populations with a viable alternative to the high and volatile production costs of industrial commodity agriculture and the uncertainties of global markets.</P><P>The picture is far from complete. To date these systems have seen only minimal investment and support. Either way, the burden of proof is on the proponents of industrial agriculture to show how it can ever be productive and <mark>sustainable</mark>, with or without miracle breakthroughs. In the meantime, a less dazzling but highly compelling agro-ecological alternative is taking shape and transforming food systems around the world.

Throughout August, Members of Congress will be back in their home states and districts meeting with constituents. As a part of August recess, The Bridge will highlight voices of AGU members that have been engaged with their legislators both in DC and back at home. Check back with us next Wednesday to hear more stories of AGU members standing up for science! For more information on how to schedule <STRONG>your</STRONG> meeting with your legislator, check out AGU’s <A href=""https://sciencepolicy.agu.org/districtdays/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">District Days website.</A> </EM></H6><P>I’m a <mark>climate</mark> scientist.  Since I started graduate school in 2001, I’ve aimed to keep myself informed about <mark>climate policy</mark>.  Like many of my peers, I’ve been extremely frustrated by the politicization of <mark>climate</mark> science.  I was thrilled when the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement entered into force on November 4 (viewing it as important step in the right direction), and dismayed on November 8 when the 2016 Presidential Election brought into question the US’s commitment to the Paris Agreement.  I didn’t sleep election night, reading everything I could about what the US election would mean for the Paris Agreement.   With the change in US leadership, like most scientists and many Americans, I am extremely concerned about policies being made that aren’t based on sound science, and that there is renewed energy around politicizing <mark>climate</mark> science.  <mark>Climate change</mark> should not be a partisan issue.  The 2016 election motivated me to become more engaged with science policy.</P><DIV id=""attachment_7674"" style=""width: 412px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Team Washington at <mark>Climate</mark> Science CVD with Rep. Herrera Beutler</P></DIV><P>I am a constituent of Congressman Reichert, a Republican member of the US House of Representatives representing Washington State’s 8th Congressional District. In July, Congressman Reichert visited my laboratory for an hour and a half. We discussed the changes in <mark>climate</mark> that I observe in our district, I showed him my research facilities and how we conduct our research, and I asked that he use me as a resource for information related to <mark>climate change</mark>. My primary goal of the visit was to build a relationship with Congressman Reichert, intending to do what I can to ensure that policies that impact <mark>climate change</mark> are being based on sound science.</P><P>I’ve been working on building a relationship with Congressman Reichert’s office since the spring. In March, I visited DC to participate in <mark>Climate</mark> Science Day, during which 25 scientists from 15 different science organizations met with congressional staff on Capitol Hill to educate and build relationships that allow members of Congress to have access to the best possible <mark>climate</mark> science information. I was a member of ‘Team Washington’, which included two other <mark>climate</mark> scientists from Washington State, and Carissa <mark>Bunge</mark>, a Public Affairs Specialist for AGU. On <mark>Climate</mark> Science Day we met with congressional staff from Washington State’s two Democratic Senators, and four Republicans from the House of Representatives. These visits were 30 minutes long, and most were held with congressional staff, with the exception of a direct meeting with Congresswoman Herrera Beutler. All of the meetings were productive, but I left the experience feeling that it was only the first step.</P><P>Upon returning to Washington State, I continued to work to build a relationship with Congressman Reichert and his staff. One of his staff members began to hold monthly office hours in my town, which allowed me to conveniently meet with his staffer. I then worked with Congressman Reichert’s office to arrange the July 7 visit to my laboratory.</P><DIV id=""attachment_7668"" style=""width: 369px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Rep. Reichert joins Dr. Kaspari in her ice core freezer to learn about her work</P></DIV><P>I purposefully kept the meeting with Congressman Reichert at my laboratory small to ensure that we stay focused on discussing <mark>climate change</mark> in our district. The meeting included Congressman Reichert and his staffer, myself, and my university’s assistant director of government relations.</P><P>The meeting exceeded my expectations. Congressman Reichert was engaged in the science, asked me a lot of questions, and made many connections to related issues in our district. One aspect of my regional research investigates the linkage between snow and glacier melt, wildfire and water resources, with fieldwork conducted on glaciers in the Cascade Mountains of Washington State. Congressman Reichert asked if it would be possible to visit one of the glaciers where we conduct this work, and I currently am in communication with his staff to arrange a visit into the field during 2018.</P><P>A secondary goal of my meeting with Congressman Reichert was to find out more about the <A href=""https://citizens<mark>climate</mark>lobby.org/<mark>climate</mark>-solutions-caucus/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><mark>Climate</mark> Solutions Caucus</A>, a bipartisan group in the House of Representatives that explores policy options that address the impacts, causes and challenges of our changing <mark>climate</mark>. Congressman Reichert joined the caucus in February, which currently has 25 democrats and 25 republicans. I asked Congressman Reichert to reach out to Republican members of the House who would support the purpose of the <mark>Climate</mark> Solutions Caucus. Congressman Reichert suggested that I could return to DC to meet with the caucus, which could be a possibility for this fall. Additionally Congressman Reichert has signed on to the <A href=""https://citizens<mark>climate</mark>lobby.org/republican-<mark>climate</mark>-resolution/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">House Republican <mark>Climate</mark> Resolution</A>, which supports the need to take action to address <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>As a republican representative, Congressman Reichert is showing a willingness to lead on <mark>climate change</mark> issues. I will continue to work with his office, both to provide myself as a resource on science issues, and to encourage Congressman Reichert to support policies that will mitigate the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Engaging with Congressman Reichert and his staff has been interesting (and fun)! I strongly recommend that other interested scientists reach out to their senators and representatives, and provide yourself as a resource. The congressional staff tend to swamped, and most offices are appreciative of people offering up their expertise. AGU also has some great resources to get you started. The August Recess is coming, an ideal time to meet with senators and representatives in your home district.</P><P> </P><P> </P><P><EM>Susan Kaspari is an Associate Professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at Central Washington University.

Factoring in the wide-scale deforestation caused by agricultural expansion, that figure rises to 30%, given the loss of <mark>carbon</mark>-sequestering trees.<SUP>3</SUP> <mark>Climate change</mark> in turn threatens food production because temperature shifts, extreme weather events, and heightened seasonal variability can all impact agricultural productivity.<SUP>3</SUP> Thus, given <mark>Bunge</mark>’s positioning in the macro agricultural supply chain, <mark>Bunge</mark> is both susceptible to, and a potential contributor to, global <mark>climate change</mark>. As such, <mark>Bunge</mark> faces the threat of 1) shortened production supply from the farmers it works with directly 2) price changes in commodity markets due to changes in global supply (even if <mark>Bunge</mark>’s supply is stable) 3) operational disruptions to its transportation and logistics network due to extreme weather events and 4) reputational risk associated with being a <mark>climate change</mark> contributor.</P><P>Operating as a “full value chain” provider increases <mark>Bunge</mark>’s risk exposure, but also positions <mark>Bunge</mark> well to advance traceability of its products, ensuring they are sourced, transported, and processed sustainably. To that end, <mark>Bunge</mark> is pursing various initiatives to build a more resilient, <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain. First, in 2015, it made a commitment to zero deforestation, aiming to have full compliance by 2020-2025.<SUP>4</SUP> Given that soy and palm oil are two of the most detrimental commodities as it relates to deforestation,<SUP>3</SUP> <mark>Bunge</mark> has focused its efforts on improving the supply chain of these products. <mark>Bunge</mark> aims to motivate its entire network of farmers and suppliers. For example, <mark>Bunge</mark> is seeking suppliers that do not disrupt High <mark>Carbon</mark> Stock (HCS) forests, as these are critical to reducing global GHG emissions. <mark>Bunge</mark> has put in place a robust system of recording and controls for its raw material inputs to validate and manage its supplier network.<SUP>5</SUP> As of Q4 2016, <mark>Bunge</mark> was able to trace the origination of 87% of its palm oil production, with areas in Asia as the key region outstanding. Improving traceability in Asia is <mark>Bunge</mark>’s long-term goal to achieving its zero-deforestation target.<SUP>6</SUP></P><P>As a short-term objective, <mark>Bunge</mark> seems to be diversifying its product mix to include a land-light line of business. Through a joint venture with TerraVia, <mark>Bunge</mark> is cultivating algae oil as an alternative to its existing oilseed products. <mark>Bunge</mark> and TerraVia have developed two AlgaWise products, an ultra omega-9 fatty acid algae oil and an algae butter, which are expected to launch in retail in 2018.<SUP>7</SUP> The environmental ramifications of producing high volumes of algae oil remains to be seen, however, its cultivation should be a more <mark>sustainable</mark> offering relative to other oil alternatives. <mark>Bunge</mark> and TerraVia are in the early days of product development, but the commitment to pursuing alternatives that lessen their dependency on land cultivation is promising.</P><P>To pursue its zero-deforestation target, <mark>Bunge</mark> should invest more heavily in technology in the near term to ensure that its suppliers are following <mark>climate</mark>-focused protocols. As a point of reference, Cargill recently announced that it will be leveraging blockchain in its supply chain of its Honeysuckle White turkey product. Through a data tagging system on every turkey in its supply chain, Cargill will be able to better monitor product sourcing with digital tracking and analytics.<SUP>8</SUP> <mark>Bunge</mark> could better digitize its palm oil and soy operations with similar systems.</P><P>In the medium to long term, rather than focusing on <EM>slowing</EM> deforestation, <mark>Bunge</mark> should help to <EM>reverse</EM> it through reforestation practices and agroforestry. By investing in agricultural products that are derived via thriving forest rather than cleared land, <mark>Bunge</mark> can grow its operations while also mitigating <mark>climate</mark> impacts. Sugar palm is an example of a product that relies upon agroforestry, in which vegetation such as trees and shrubs are integrated into crop and farming systems.<SUP>3</SUP> The challenge is that <mark>Bunge</mark>’s current product portfolio does not lend itself to forest-minded agricultural practices – ultimately, palm oil and soy are detrimental to the land and expose <mark>Bunge</mark> to intractable <mark>climate</mark> risk. <mark>Bunge</mark> needs to support the development of alternatives to these products that will can satisfy global demand and should invest more heavily in R&amp;D to that end.</P><P>What is <mark>Bunge</mark>’s role in reducing the use of palm oil across the supply chain?

But evidence has just emerged that <mark>Bunge</mark> is excessively reliant on a single palm oil supplier that has engaged in rampant deforestation and clearance of ultra <mark>carbon</mark> rich peatland, and is working to sabotage emerging progress that is breaking the link between commodity production and deforestation.</P><P><A href=""www.<mark>bunge</mark>.com/sites/default/files/2014-2-EPRConferenceCall.4Q13.pdf"">Information about today’s call is available online.</A></P><P><STRONG>Why This Matters: <mark>Bunge</mark> and Sarawak</STRONG></P><P>Sarawak Oil Palms Bhd (SOP) is actively working to sabotage progress towards protecting forests, peatlands, and the people that rely on them. According to trade data, <mark>Bunge</mark> purchases 88% of the Sarawak Oil Palms Bhd Company exports. According to <mark>Bunge</mark>’s own filings with the industry trade group, this represents approximately 44% of <mark>Bunge</mark>’s total global palm oil supply.</P><P>Sourcing from SOP will likely make <mark>Bunge</mark> ineligible to supply to major global, premium value customers because of SOP’s rampant deforestation and clearance of peat. The world’s largest palm oil consumers including Nestle, Unilever, Hershey’s, Mondelez, Ferrero Rocher, Neste Oil, Safeway, and Reckitt Benckiser have all made public commitments not to source palm oil from companies engaged in deforestation or peatland clearance. Many other companies are racing to adopt similar policies in response to rising pressure from consumers. Continuing to source from SOP means that <mark>Bunge</mark> will have a difficult time accessing these markets. </P><P>Sarawak’s actions have drawn the attention of major companies and investors and create a significant liability for <mark>Bunge</mark>. Reporters should ask what actions it will take to mitigate this risk.</P><P>Wilmar International (the world’s largest palm oil trader with a 45% market share) recently announced its “No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation” policy that requires their suppliers to immediately cease deforestation, peatland clearance and human rights abuse. Wilmar is working hard to implement the policy, and we have already seen many supplier companies take action to comply. As such, the policy has created important momentum.</P><P><STRONG>More on Sarawak</STRONG></P><UL><LI>Sarawak Oil Palms continues to clear Sarawak’s globally important peat resource (<A href=""http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/library/HSBC-logging-briefing-FINAL-WEB3.pdf"">see evidence about corruption and deforestation in Sarawak on pages 4 and 14 here</A>)
</LI><LI>We understand that Sarawak Oil Palms is telling other Sarawak palm oil suppliers that they can keep on destroying peat and forests and that Sarawak Oil Palms will continue to buy palm oil – no questions asked.</LI><LI>Sarawak Oil Palms CEO Wong Kee Hwong also serves as CEO of the Sarawak Oil Palm Plantation Owners Association (SOPPOA), and <A href=""http://www.btimes.com.my/Current_News/BTIMES/articles/20140117014922/Article/index_html"">has been using the trade association as a platform to publicly attack peat protection policies</A>.</LI><LI>Sarawak Oil Palms has aggressively lobbied Sarawak’s government to oppose peat, forest, and community protection.</LI><LI>Peatland clearance for palm oil is the largest contributor to <mark>climate change</mark> in Southeast Asia. <A href=""http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/october/oil-palm-plantation.html"">Studies by Kim Carlson and others for the National Academies of Science and Stanford University</A> have shown that clearance of peatland in just part of the island of Borneo are expected to release more greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere than Canada’s entire fossil fuel sector.</LI><LI>Sarawak is the epicenter of peatland clearance in the world.

President Evo Morales, a socialist, has made securing “food sovereignty” a major part of his agenda, driving Bolivia’s agricultural expansion. There are relatively few forest protections, and the government’s Forestry and Land Authority is tasked with the potentially conflicting roles of regulating land use, forestry and agriculture, and issuing concessions for logging and farming.

A major investigation found that <mark>Bunge</mark> was far and away the company that drove the most deforestation for animal feed in Brazil last year. </P><P>Fortunately, some responsibly-minded companies are trying to hold <mark>Bunge</mark> accountable. Just recently, 23 of the world’s largest <A href=""http://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/twenty-three-global-companies-pledge-to-helping-tackle-soy-driven-deforestation-in-brazil%E2%80%99s-cerrado"" target=""_blank"" title="""">meat retailers, including McDonald’s and Walmart</A>, called on <mark>Bunge</mark> and other companies to stop its deforestation. But <mark>Bunge</mark> has shown no interest in changing its practices. And, again, they’re able to do so in part because CalPERS, while propping them up financially, has failed to take the company to task for its destructive practices.</P><P>While CalPERS waits on the sidelines, other international financial institutions large and small are acting. The international banks HSBC and BNP Paribas have adopted<A href=""https://qz.com/853098/global-banks-have-2-8-trillion-worth-of-power-to-stop-deforestation-and-only-a-handful-are-using-it/"" target=""_blank"" title=""""> strong policies to limit financing of companies driving deforestation</A>. And institutional investors like New York State Pension Fund and Green Century Capital Management, representing trillions of dollars in assets, have <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-latam-deforestation-investors/investors-with-617-billion-in-assets-urge-suppliers-to-cut-deforestation-idUSKBN16S2FS"" target=""_blank"" title="""">called on companies like Posco and <mark>Bunge</mark> to stop deforestation</A>.</P><P>Funding tropical deforestation is out of step with the values best represented by California’s leaders, who have long taken the mantle as environmental vanguards. CalPERS can do better, as it showed by being one of the first major funds to divest from coal, inspiring other investors to follow suit.</P><P>By applying similar principles to its agricultural investments, it can make a big difference as well. By divesting from bad actors like Posco and <mark>Bunge</mark>, and instituting a comprehensive approach to preventing rainforest destruction by its investees, CalPERS can join the rest of California in truly leading on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P><SPAN class=""ng_tagline_contrib"">Henry A.

Seconds before the tornado struck, a cell phone alert prompted the camp manager to rush the children out of the dome and into an adjacent building, preventing injuries and a possible loss of life.</P><P>The warning came from National Weather Service’s newly implemented Wireless Emergency Alerts system, which sends 90-character emergency messages to the cell phones of those in the path of an approaching hazard.</P><P>This fast and geographically targeted system, developed by Robert <mark>Bunge</mark>, Michael Gerber, Mark Paese and Gregory Zwicker of the Wireless Emergency Alerts Team, has transmitted more than 15,000 warnings since 2012 for the most dangerous types of weather—such as tornados, flash floods and hurricanes—to the cell phones of millions of people across the United States.</P><P>“Citizens can now take immediate action when they receive an alert, saving lives and preventing injury,” said Deirdre Jones, acting director of operational systems at the National Weather Service.</P><P>While other weather alert systems have been in operation, the new system of using mobile devices and targeting very precise geographic areas is a significant breakthrough. It involved leveraging the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Integrated Public Alert and Warning System as well as coordinating with the Federal Communications Commission and wireless telecommunication providers, and required changes in the weather service’s internal operations.</P><P>The team built out the sophisticated technology, protocols and infrastructure needed to extract and transmit the alerts from the weather service’s highly complex warning system. They facilitated the decision-making for the weather alerts to be transmitted, and they oversaw extensive public awareness and educational initiatives to ensure the success of the program.</P><P><mark>Bunge</mark> led the technical team, overseeing the software development, the data specialists, the coding, the host servers and other information technology needs, and helped create a system that ensures the cell phone alerts go to specific geographic locations. “Bob came into the weather service with the idea of communicating weather information using newer technologies. This is his crowning achievement,” said Jones.</P><P>Gerber is a meteorologist and a specialist in how information is disseminated. He played a critical role in making sure the right kind of weather alerts would be available and properly transmitted, and is credited with persuading wireless carriers to make the needed investments that improved geographical targeting.</P><P>Paese was instrumental in conceptualizing a commercial mobile alert service which ultimately evolved into the new system, and he handled many of the complicated management issues. Zwicker also was involved with project management as well as the testing and documentation necessary to keep the project going.</P><P>Besides the fortuitous warning in Connecticut in 2013, the alert system has proved its worth in many other instances.</P><P>In November of 2013, for example, a tornado struck Washington, Illinois, where Daniel Bennett was officiating Sunday services at his church with 600 to 700 people. According to an Associated Press account, Bennett heard the first of two dozen electronic warning tones—text messages from the cell phone alert system—cautioning that a twister was in the area. Bennett stopped the services, ushered everyone to a safe place until the threat passed, and later told the wire service that there was little doubt the warnings helped minimize deaths and injuries throughout the Illinois community.</P><P>Under processes and systems that had previously been in place, emergency alerts were more manually intensive and often required information sent by email. Older systems lacked an automated way for specific warning information to target areas of the country using cellular providers.</P><P>“There was a car alarm syndrome where people were alerted so much that they stopped paying attention because of the irrelevance of the alert,” said Damon Penn, FEMA’s assistant administrator for national continuity programs.</P><P>The new wireless alert system structures the information into concise messages and uses geo-targeted data to broadcast those messages over cell phones only in the affected areas. And it all happens quickly.</P><P>“This is an extremely powerful public service,” said Andrew Stern, the acting director of the Office of <mark>Climate</mark>, Water and Weather Services.</P><P><mark>Bunge</mark> said it took a number of years to get the system up and running, and the team had to overcome a number of technical and administrative obstacles. “But we saw the value and the potential impact it would have in saving lives,” said <mark>Bunge</mark>. “It was a challenge, but it has been rewarding.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""col-md-4 margin-t-10 hidden-print""><H4 class=""text-uppercase"">Honoree Details</H4><P>Software Branch Chief, Telecommunications Operations CenterNational Weather ServiceNational Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationSilver Spring, Maryland</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The icon of <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ladder_of_Divine_Ascent""><EM>The Ladder of Divine Ascent</EM></A> perfectly illustrates the danger.</P><P>Monks with outstretched hands climb up the ladder of virtues, hoping to take the hand offered to them by Our Lord in heaven at the top, while angels and a cloud of witnesses encourage the monks as they ascend.</P><P>Some monks, however, never make it to Our Lord and heaven. Along the way some fall to the arrows and snares of demons, whose goal is to pull them down into hell.</P><P>The icon pays homage to <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Climacus"">St. John Climacus</A> (ca. 579 – 649), the author of one of Christianity’s most important and influential spiritual works: His <A href=""http://www.bostonmonks.com/product_info.php/products_id/569""><EM>The Ladder of Divine Ascent</EM></A> is a seventh-century treatise on the thirty steps a monk, and every Christian, must take to ascend to heaven and not fall to the wiles of Satan.</P><P>The metaphor of the ladder used by Climacus is a familiar one since it is derived from <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob's_Ladder"">the ladder in Jacob’s dream</A> in Genesis.</P><P>The book remains so influential in the Byzantine-Slavonic tradition that it is read daily as part of the hours during the six weeks of the Great Fast or Lent.</P><P>Because the road to God demands choosing the narrow way, ascetics of the Eastern Christians, following the model of Our Lord and his disciples, seek a relationship with an experienced guide called a spiritual father.</P><P>Gabriel <mark>Bunge</mark>, a Russian Orthodox priest and schemamonk, explores what it means to be a spiritual father in the traditional sense in <A href=""https://www.svspress.com/spiritual-fatherhood-evagrius-ponticus-on-the-role-of-the-spiritual-father/""><EM>Spiritual Fatherhood: Evagrius Ponticus and the Role of the Spiritual Fathe</EM>r</A> (St. Vladimir Seminary Press), the third book he has published on the teachings of the fourth-century monk.</P><P><A href=""https://orthodoxwiki.org/Evagrius_Ponticus"">Evagrius</A> teaches with first-hand experience of spiritual fatherhood as a spiritual son of three great spiritual fathers – <A href=""https://orthodoxwiki.org/Gregory_the_Theologian"">Gregory the Theologian</A>, <A href=""https://orthodoxwiki.org/Macarius_the_Great"">Macarius the Great</A>, and <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macarius_of_Alexandria"">Macarius the Alexandrian</A> – and then later as a renowned spiritual father himself.</P><P>In the early Church, spiritual fathers were not formed like spiritual directors today in seminary or in programs. They received the gift of spiritual fatherhood directly from the Holy Spirit, which, <mark>Bunge</mark> tells us, is unattainable in any other way.</P><P>Spiritual fatherhood, therefore, is not an institution and it is <EM>“bound neither to the office nor to the sex and age of the one gifted.”</EM> And because the gift is a charism of the Holy Spirit, it only can be received by those within the Church.</P><P>In addition, one receives the gift of spiritual fatherhood after spending some time being guided by another. <mark>Bunge</mark> writes: <EM>“No one can be someone else’s spiritual father before he himself has been a spiritual son.”</EM></P><P>The relationship of spiritual father and spiritual son, therefore, is far deeper than the typical relationship between a spiritual director and, as a director often calls him, a “directee.” All spiritual directors are guides, but few are spiritual fathers.</P><P>Spiritual fatherhood, <mark>Bunge</mark> writes, has a place in God’s saving plan because “<EM>it participates in the Father’s effecting of salvation in the Son through the Holy Spirit.”</EM> Through spiritual fatherhood, a gift given only to some, <EM>“divine self-emptying can be experienced in a human way.”</EM></P><P>A spiritual father, therefore, must be an ascetic, because it is through long years of ascetical practice that one experiences this self-emptying and becomes a dwelling place for the Holy Spirit. <mark>Bunge</mark> writes:<EM> “We cannot teach others what we have not lived out.”</EM></P><P>A spiritual father also must be spiritual as defined by the Church. While to Evagrius the term spiritual refers to the Holy Spirit, it also refers to the Holy Trinity since the Holy Spirit is one of the persons of the Trinity and consubstantial with the Father and Son.</P><P>A spiritual person, then, is one who has <EM>“a personal relationship with God in the Holy Spirit.”</EM> And because the Holy Spirit dwells in the spiritual father, an immoral person cannot be a spiritual father. An immoral person, <mark>Bunge</mark> tells us, cannot even be spiritual.</P><P>Above all else, the spiritual father imitates the fatherhood of Christ, who is the true and actual teacher. Evagrius writes:</P><P><EM>“It is the father’s place to educate the sons with regard to virtue and the knowledge of God; to give the children wisdom, however, is the Lord’s place.”</EM></P><P>With this gift of wisdom, a human being becomes a true person. In educating his spiritual sons in virtue and the knowledge of God, the spiritual father, therefore, participates in the Lord’s “salvific work.” <mark>Bunge</mark> writes:</P><P><EM>“The heavenly fatherhood of Christ manifests itself among us men in the angel-like service of the spiritual father, through whom Christ operates.”</EM></P><P>It is especially important to return to the sources of foundational knowledge in times of confusion such as our own when even our basic understanding of fatherhood is under attack.</P><P>In returning to the traditional Christian understanding of the spiritual father in the early Church, <mark>Bunge</mark> strips away the scales from our eyes so that we can see once again the true meaning of being spiritual, knowledge and wisdom, and <EM>diakonia</EM>.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""post-footer""><DIV class=""social-icons ed-social-share-icons""><P class=""share-title"">Share:</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Three species representing two genera were selected for assessment of their vulnerability to <mark>climate change</mark>. The first species was <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Salsola vermiculata</EM> L. which is common to both study areas. The second genus was represented by two species, <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Haloxylon salicornicum</EM> (Moq.) <mark>Bunge</mark> from the Syrian rangelands and <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">H. schmittianum</EM> Pomel from southern Tunisia. To assess the vulnerability of these species to <mark>climate change</mark> we used ecological-based models. The data inputs were composed of the species occurrence data and the environmental data which included eight climatic layers, three soil property layers in addition to an altitude layer. Since environmental parameters only enable assessing the sensitivity of target species to <mark>climate change</mark>, a grazing pressure layer was used to assess the species vulnerability. Only climatic parameters were considered as changing across three periods; current situation, 2020 and 2050. The main results indicated that threatened range species, such as <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">S. vermiculata</EM> which were subjected to continuous grazing pressure, showed high vulnerability to <mark>climate change</mark> as expressed by the predicted decrease in the areas of their distribution. However, species with low palatability and broad ecological niches (i.e. <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">H. salicornicum</EM> and <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">H. schmittianum</EM>) had an advantage due to the reduced competition for water and nutrients. An adaptation strategy to increase the resilience of the most vulnerable species should involve management of grazing pressure and the establishment of other mitigation measures.</P></SECTION><DIV class=""KeywordGroup"" lang=""en""><H2 class=""Heading"">Keywords</H2><SPAN class=""Keyword"">Grazing Pressure </SPAN><SPAN class=""Keyword"">Small Ruminant </SPAN><SPAN class=""Keyword"">Climatic Niche </SPAN><SPAN class=""Keyword"">Ongoing <mark>Climate Change</mark> </SPAN><SPAN class=""Keyword"">Broad Ecological Niche </SPAN><DIV id=""test-keyword-message"" class=""u-interface u-italic"">

The scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) project a further increase in global mean surface temperature of 2–6 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, increased incidence of floods and droughts, and spatial and temporal changes in precipitation patterns (IPCC <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR22"">2007</A></SPAN>). All studies have warned that the negative impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> will become much more intense and frequent, particularly if combined with continuous environmentally destructive human activities (Nordblom and Shomo <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR32"">1993</A></SPAN>). The potential ecological impact of ongoing <mark>climate change</mark> has been highly debated in recent years. It is forecasted that, by the end of the century, <mark>climate change</mark> and its impacts may be the dominant direct driver of biodiversity loss and changes in ecosystem services at the global level (Phillips et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR39"">2006</A></SPAN>).</P><P class=""Para"">Although the West Asia and North Africa (WANA) countries can be considered among those having contributed the least to global greenhouse gas emissions, they are considered the region most susceptible to <mark>climate change</mark> impacts for many reasons: (1) all scenarios expect significant increases in temperature and reductions in precipitation, (2) the high dependence of resident communities on natural resources and livestock for their livelihoods, (3) the poverty in many parts of the region increases the vulnerability of affected people to respond to an increased incidence of drought and floods and (4) the overuse of natural resources renders them less resilient to the impact of higher temperatures and lower and more variable precipitation (Seo and Mendelsohn <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR46"">2006</A></SPAN>).</P><P class=""Para"">In the WANA region, climatic changes could lead to a shortage of water resources, widespread land degradation and increased desertification. These threats could also have a major impact on rangeland biodiversity, the life cycle of plants, and productivity due to lack of rain and repeated periods of drought. Moreover, they may reduce the resilience of rangeland ecosystems as shown for the <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Stipa tenacissima</EM> ecosystem in North Africa (Ben Salem et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR7"">2007</A></SPAN>), where they suffer from advanced deterioration in recent years as a result of combined effects of disturbance and frequent droughts. <mark>Climate change</mark> will increase the negative impacts of drought on rangeland vegetation such as low emergence of annual species; changes in phenology and the timing of reproduction; reduced biodiversity; low plant cover; and decline of the productive capacity in pastoral systems (Ouled Belgacem et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR36"">2008</A></SPAN>). Several scientists (Elith et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR10"">2006</A></SPAN>; Phillips et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR39"">2006</A></SPAN>) expect that plant species will migrate to other areas, where they may better meet their ecological requirements.</P><P class=""Para"">A large portion of the WANA region is arid or semi-arid with shallow and low fertility soils and poor plant cover. Additionally, this region has experienced increased human populations, urbanization, and elevated food consumption above the region’s production capacity; as well as costly and un<mark>sustainable</mark> production (El Kharraz et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR9"">2012</A></SPAN>). In this region, rangelands represent the single largest land use type, covering over two-thirds of the total land area with over 1.7 billion ha and provided most of the feed resources for livestock in the past (Steinfeld et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR47"">2006</A></SPAN>). However, today their contribution has been greatly reduced and in most WANA countries natural feed resources do not provide more than 20 % of livestock needs (Nordblom and Shomo <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR32"">1993</A></SPAN>).</P><P class=""Para"">In WANA region, the natural vegetation cover, mainly composed of very sparse steppe species, has been altered by various human activities (Le Floc’h <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR25"">1995</A></SPAN>). Conversion of natural ecosystems to farmland, exploitation through selective harvesting, fuel wood removal, charcoal production and livestock overgrazing are the major causes of degradation, habitat change and biodiversity loss (Reyers <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR42"">2004</A></SPAN>). Disturbances created by these activities influence ecosystem dynamics, structure and composition at the local and regional scales, and are important in structuring plant communities (Hubbell et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR20"">1999</A></SPAN>).</P><P class=""Para"">Most rangelands in the WANA region exhibit arid or semi-arid <mark>climate</mark>s with low and unpredictable precipitation and wide temperature fluctuations. Consequently natural vegetation has developed various mechanisms to adapt to these seasonal changes in temperature, by reducing growth rates, photosynthetic rates, mineral absorption and tissue regeneration, and by increasing concentrations of secondary metabolites (Jochum et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR23"">2007</A></SPAN>). However, these mechanisms could not be able to cope with the anticipated severe <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P class=""Para"">The last few decades have seen an increased interest in the use of species distribution models (Guisan and Thuiller <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR15"">2005</A></SPAN>). These models are empirical, in nature, relating species data (either simple presence, or presence—absence) to environmental predictor variables. Environmental predictors can exert direct or indirect effects on species and must be optimally chosen to reflect the three main types of influences on the species: (i) limiting factors related to species eco-physiology (e.g. temperature, water, soil composition); (ii) natural or human-induced disturbances, and (iii) resources (e.g. energy and water) that can be assimilated by organisms (Guisan and Thuiller <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR15"">2005</A></SPAN>). The environmental data related to these three main types of influence on species distribution are best manipulated within a geographical information system (GIS). Maximum entropy approaches have also grown dramatically over the few last years. These approaches are based on the use of presence-only data for modeling species distribution. Presence-only methods are necessary because the absence of a species is difficult to demonstrate, and because false absences can decrease the reliability of the predictive models (Phillips et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR39"">2006</A></SPAN>).</P><P class=""Para"">The vulnerability to <mark>climate change</mark> was defined as the degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, including <mark>climate</mark> variability and extremes (Carter et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR8"">2007</A></SPAN>). This concept which emphasizes the potential for harm is more focused on outcomes resulting from <mark>climate change</mark>. It also explicitly recognizes the social dimension of vulnerability in the form of coping capacity (Preston and Stafford-Smith <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR40"">2009</A></SPAN>). Coping with, or adapting to, extreme climatic events involves both biophysical and socioeconomic factors. Therefore, a system’s vulnerability depends not only on it being exposed to increasing problematic climatic events, but also on its environmental and social characteristics that will affect the impact of the anomalous weather (Máñez Costa et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR28"">2011</A></SPAN>). Indeed, <mark>climate</mark> is one driver of system behavior, and other drivers may also be undergoing significant change (e.g. land use and/or demographic change) (Preston and Stafford-Smith <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR40"">2009</A></SPAN>).</P><P class=""Para"">Species vulnerability assessments consider vulnerability to <mark>climate change</mark> as the extent to which a species (within a defined geographical area) is susceptible to harm from <mark>climate</mark> impacts (Schneider et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR45"">2007</A></SPAN>). These assessments can be used to identify which species are likely to be significantly impacted by projected <mark>climate change</mark>s, and to assist in understanding why they may be vulnerable. A number of vulnerability assessment tools have recently been developed to assist land managers in evaluating and prioritizing actions taken in response to <mark>climate change</mark>, including mitigation strategies such as assisted migration (Fitzpatrick et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR12"">2008</A></SPAN>). In order to enhance the adaptation of rangeland species to ongoing <mark>climate change</mark> by increasing their resilience, an assessment of their vulnerability to this risk is needed first. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on the geographical distribution of selected native plant species from the Syrian and southern Tunisia rangelands.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec2"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1 SectionTypeMaterialsAndMethods""><H2 class=""Heading""><SPAN class=""HeadingNumber"">2 </SPAN>Materials and methods</H2><DIV class=""content""><SECTION id=""Sec3"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section2 RenderAsSection2""><H3 class=""Heading""><SPAN class=""HeadingNumber"">2.1 </SPAN>Study areas</H3><P class=""Para"">Two representative areas of the WANA region were selected for the study, the Syrian rangelands (34° 28′ 45″N and 38° 35′ 00″E) and southern Tunisia (32° 45′ 00″N and 10° 20′ 75″E). The Syrian rangelands cover a total area of 10 million ha, or 55 % of the country’s land area, and stretches over large parts of central and eastern Syria (ACSAD <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR1"">2004</A></SPAN>; Louhaichi and Tastad <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR26"">2010</A></SPAN>). The soils of Syrian Badia belong to the order of Aridisols (the 1975 United States Department of Agriculture Soil Taxonomy), mostly characterized by Calcic or Gypsic horizons close to the soils surface, weak structure and relatively light texture, which predisposes them to erosion (ACSAD <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR1"">2004</A></SPAN>). Characterized by low rainfall (&lt;200 mm per year), which decreases from west to east, it is suitable only as grazing land for small ruminants, equines and camels. The Bedouin communities that inhabit the rangelands herd about 12 million animals within this area, predominantly sheep, but also goats (about 1.6 million) and camels (about 27,000) (ACSAD <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR1"">2004</A></SPAN>). This high stocking rate is beyond the appropriate carrying capacity, and has led to drastic deterioration of the native rangelands and depleted their contribution to successful animal production systems (Louhaichi et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR27"">2012</A></SPAN>). Only the middle part of the rangelands (2,831,988 ha) is relevant to this study.</P><P class=""Para"">The Medenine prefecture is a representative area of southern Tunisia that covers about 626,815 ha. It is limited in the east by the Mediterranean Sea and crossed by the Matmata mountain chain as a bioclimatic barrier between the arid and the Saharan <mark>climate</mark>. Grazing is the dominant land use and consists mostly of dwarf ligneous vegetation, known locally as steppes. The <mark>climate</mark> is arid Mediterranean with low and irregular rainfall (100–200 mm) with hot and dry summers. According to the French system of soil classification, the soils of the study area are poor and marginal and classified as xerosols with raw minerals covering hard rocks, coarse colluvium or calcareous and gypsum crusts (Mtimet <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR31"">2001</A></SPAN>). These steppes are mostly overgrazed due to the relatively high number of grazing animals (511,270 head) mainly composed of sheep (301,000), goats (188,000) and camels (13,000).</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec4"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section2 RenderAsSection2""><H3 class=""Heading""><SPAN class=""HeadingNumber"">2.2 </SPAN>Target shrub species</H3><P class=""Para"">Three dwarf shrub species representing two genera from the <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Chenopodiaceae</EM> family were selected for assessment of their vulnerability to <mark>climate change</mark>. The species common to both study areas was <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Salsola vermiculata</EM> L., Mediterranean saltwort, a dominant perennial species in the Mediterranean arid zone. It grows on sandy—silt soils in the lowlands and the slightly saline alluvial plains. It is well known for its high palatability and range value for small ruminants and camels (Assaeed <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR4"">2001</A></SPAN>). The second genus <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Haloxylon</EM> is represented by two invasive species: <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">H. salicornicum</EM> (Moq.) <mark>Bunge</mark> in the Syrian rangelands and <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">H. schmittianum</EM> Pomel in southern Tunisia. Both species have comparable ecological requirements and range values. They are dwarf shrubs growing in hot, dry areas on shallow to deep sands or silty soils, and also found in gravel plains. Despite their relative importance as camel browse, they are of low range value and palatability for small ruminants and constitute an indicator of fair rangeland condition (Assaeed <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR3"">1996</A></SPAN>). The current distribution maps of the target species (<EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Salsola</EM> and <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Haloxylon</EM>) are extracted from those achieved within the framework of the National Forest and Pastoral Survey in Tunisia (RSNC <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR43"">2007</A></SPAN>) and the Syrian Badia (= rangelands) project (ACSAD <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR1"">2004</A></SPAN>).</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec5"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section2 RenderAsSection2""><H3 class=""Heading""><SPAN class=""HeadingNumber"">2.3 </SPAN>Environmental and socioeconomic data</H3><P class=""Para"">Environmental data included eight climatic layers, three soil property layers, plus an altitude layer. The current <mark>climate</mark> of both study areas was described by eight <mark>climate</mark> variables (mean annual temperature, minimum temperature of the coldest month, maximum temperature of the warmest month, temperature seasonal variation, mean annual precipitation, precipitation of wettest month, precipitation of driest month and precipitation seasonal variation) downloaded from the layers of the world <mark>climate</mark> database (<SPAN class=""ExternalRef""><A target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.worldclim.org/""><SPAN class=""RefSource"">www.worldclim.org</SPAN></A></SPAN>). This database also provided information on the altitude surface of the distribution of the target species in the area. The data (Shape ESRI Grid, 2.5 arcmin resolution) and altitude were downloaded from the WorldClim database (Hijmans et al<EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">.</EM><SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR18"">2005</A></SPAN>). The three soil variables included soil texture (i.e. percentage of clay, silt and sand contents), soil depth and soil salinity. In arid areas, these variables are considered critical to the spatial distribution of plant species (Floret and Pontanier <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR13"">1982</A></SPAN>). These layers were extracted from the regional agriculture map of the governorate of Medenine in Tunisia (<SPAN class=""ExternalRef""><A target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.carteagricole.agrinet.tn/""><SPAN class=""RefSource"">www.carteagricole.agrinet.tn</SPAN></A></SPAN>) and from the Syrian Badia Development Project. In both countries, the scale of these layers is 1/50,000.</P><P class=""Para"">Climatic projections, using the same eight variables as the current situation, were achieved for the years 2020 and 2050 using the average of predictions of the widely used global circulation model HADCM3, within the frame of the A2 scenario of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions (IPCC <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR21"">2000</A></SPAN>). Data (grid format, 2.5 arcmin of resolution) were downloaded from the gisweb database (<SPAN class=""ExternalRef""><A target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.gisweb.ciat.org/""><SPAN class=""RefSource"">www.gisweb.ciat.org</SPAN></A></SPAN>).</P><DIV class=""Para"">Since environmental parameters only enable assessing the sensitivity of target species to <mark>climate change</mark>, the use of socioeconomic parameters describing the human pressure is necessary to assess the species vulnerability (O’Brien et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR33"">2004</A></SPAN>). In this case grazing is the main common use in both study areas. Consequently, the socioeconomic layer was represented by a synthetic variable called the Coefficient of Overgrazing (CO), which aims to estimate the current state of the species in relation to animal pressure (i.e. species are overgrazed, moderately grazed or under grazed):<DIV id=""Equa"" class=""Equation EquationMathjax""><DIV class=""EquationContent"">$$ \mathrm{CO}\left( \% \right)=1-{{\mathrm{GC}} \left/ {\mathrm{SD}} \right.} $$</DIV></DIV></DIV><P class=""Para"">Where GC is grazing capacity and SD is stocking density.</P><P class=""Para"">The map of this variable (1/50,000 scale) was generated from the current grazing capacity (determined from the rangelands units production map) and from the stocking density map as expressed by the spatial distribution of the herds in both study areas (ACSAD <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR1"">2004</A></SPAN>, MAWR <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR30"">2004</A></SPAN>). In order to emphasize the impact of <mark>climate change</mark>, it was assumed that grazing pressure (the main land use) is kept unchanged for both 2020 and 2050. Otherwise the modeling exercise would be complicated by the interactions of biotic and abiotic factors.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec6"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section2 RenderAsSection2""><H3 class=""Heading""><SPAN class=""HeadingNumber"">2.4 </SPAN>Species spatial distribution modeling</H3><P class=""Para""><mark>Climate</mark> envelope modeling is a tool to easily assess the potential impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on species spatial distributions. This type of modeling uses geographic distributions of documented species to predict the location of its climatic niche, i.e. the possible presence of the species. Future shifts in climatic niche are then estimated based on <mark>climate</mark> projections from global circulation models.</P><P class=""Para"">To meet the study objectives, the ecological niche concept (Phillips et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR39"">2006</A></SPAN>) was applied, which emphasized the relationship between species occurrence and environmental parameters. The species distribution modeling software MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) was considered the most suitable model for this case, and was a recent implementation of a statistical approach which characterized probability distributions from incomplete information (Phillips et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR39"">2006</A></SPAN>). The latter authors enumerated many advantages of using Maxent, compared to other modeling approaches. The most important were: (1) the model requires only presence data, together with environmental information for the study area, (2) the occurrence data could represent an incomplete sample of an empirical probability distribution, (3) the unknown distribution could be most appropriately estimated as the distribution with maximum entropy as subjected to constraints imposed by environmental variables, and (4) the distribution of maximum entropy approximated the potential geographic distribution of the species. It was also indicated that Maxent was relatively insensitive to spatial errors associated with location data, requires few locations to construct useful models, and performs better than other presence-only modeling approaches (Baldwin <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR5"">2009</A></SPAN>). However, in Maxent different prior assumptions were reflected in the method of background sample selection and accounting for sampling bias. Because it is an ‘only presence’ data model, a species may be recorded as absent instead of present at a given location if it could not be detected, or the species may be absent but the habitat is suitable, or the habitat may truly be unsuitable for the species, with the former two situations leading to the possible identification of a false absence (Ortega-Huerta and Peterson <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR34"">2008</A></SPAN>). By default, when using Maxent the assumption was made that the species occurrence data were unbiased and independent samples were based on the distribution of the species (Phillips et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR39"">2006</A></SPAN>). As for other ecological or bioclimatic models, in Maxent the most important assumption was that the distribution of species was determined wholly or partly by <mark>climate</mark> (Aruju and Peterson <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR2"">2012</A></SPAN>). The selected environmental variables (climatic and soil) were considered key factors for species distribution in Maxent (assumptions). However, other factors such as interspecific interactions can also play an important role in the distribution of the species and were not considered by the model. These interactions could be either positive (e.g., mutualists such as seed dispersors, pollinators, etc.) or negative (e.g., competitors, predators, diseases). By limiting or enhancing population processes, interactions could obviously affect distributions. Moreover, this model was only capable of predicting the relative probability of occurrence. Considering this, plus the quality of the opportunistically collected occurrence data and its coarse resolution, and the remotely sensed environmental data, predictions need to be interpreted cautiously when creating range maps and when using them to answer complex ecological questions. In many cases, Maxent was best suited for hypothesis generation and for asking better questions, but not for answering them. For this case MaxEnt (Version 3.3.3a) was utilized, as it seemed the most suitable approach for modeling species spatial distributions under both current (Elith et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR10"">2006</A></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR11"">2011</A></SPAN>) and future environments (Hijmans and Graham <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR17"">2006</A></SPAN>). The model validation was conducted by comparing the maps predicting of the vulnerability of both species for the current situation with maps of the actual current distribution. Model validation was achieved by the use of a certain number of iterations or training points as it was required by the model.</P></SECTION></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec7"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1 SectionTypeResults""><H2 class=""Heading""><SPAN class=""HeadingNumber"">3 </SPAN>Results</H2><DIV class=""content""><DIV class=""Para"">In addition to the areas where <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">S. vermiculata</EM> has been recorded in the Syrian rangelands, it could potentially occupy several other sites where its ecological requirements may be met and the current environmental conditions, including <mark>climate</mark>, would be favorable for its distribution in the region (Fig. <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Fig1"">1</A></SPAN>). However in south-eastern Tunisia, the potential geographical distribution of <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">S. vermiculata</EM> was limited to the middle portion of the target area, between the coast and the mountain chain (Fig. <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Fig2"">2</A></SPAN>). In the study areas, <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">S. vermiculata</EM> was apparently highly vulnerable to ongoing <mark>climate change</mark> combined with human pressure, i.e. grazing (Figs. <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Fig1"">1</A></SPAN> and <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Fig2"">2</A></SPAN>). This was more significant at the horizon of 2050, when the geographical distribution would be restricted to small and scattered ecological niches, where the plant may meet its requirements. The contributions of environmental and socioeconomic variables in explaining these trends are presented in Table <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Tab1"">1</A></SPAN>. Among the environmental variables, the variation of temperature seasonality (32.2 and 28.5 % in Syria and Tunisia, respectively) followed by mean annual precipitation (26.2 and 28.7 %, in Syria and Tunisia, respectively) were the main variables restricting the geographical distribution of <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">S. vermiculata</EM> in both study areas. The precipitation of the wettest month (15–18 %) was the third most important variable limiting the distribution of <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">S. vermiculata</EM>. There were no important effects of the other variables on the trends of <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">S. vermiculata</EM> distribution—mainly those related to geomorphology and edaphic conditions of the site. <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">S. vermiculata</EM> is well adapted to extremes of temperature and summer drought, as confirmed by the low contributions of the related variables. However, the socioeconomic variable (i.e. CO) contributed 10 and 12 % in Syria and Tunisia, respectively, and seemed to enhance the former climatic parameters’ impact on the species’ resilience capacity.

The programme researchers, based at Oxford's Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, aim to find out which assets and sectors are most at risk and evaluate how investors, businesses and policy makers can best respond to the challenges.</P><P>To mark the launch, Rt Hon John Gummer, Lord Deben, Chairman of the Committee on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, will give a lecture at the School, highlighting the need for businesses and policy makers to adapt to the new economic landscape. He said: 'Investors continue to deploy hundreds of billions of pounds into polluting and un<mark>sustainable</mark> sectors. In many cases these investments will not be worth what investors think.</P><P>'<mark>Climate change</mark>, scarcer resources, and new disruptive technologies will reduce value and strand assets. If investors better understand the risks of investing in these assets they will be attracted to greener alternatives and see them as better business propositions and safer places for their funds. The programme is doing the further research necessary to help underpin this vital transition.'</P><P>Professor Gordon Clark, Director of the Smith School, said: 'We are looking at how changes in regulation, pricing, technology, society and <mark>climate</mark> could be a risk to a range of polluting assets and how this could be a material risk to the investors and businesses involved, as well as for policy makers and regulators. Our new programme is creating a critically important space for these issues to be understood and for appropriate responses to be developed.'</P><P>The four-year research programme aims to identify high-<mark>carbon</mark> sectors and assets that could be dramatically devalued or written off. The first project will focus on the international supply chain for the agricultural sector, examining methods of transportation and production. Other studies, to be commissioned as the programme develops, are likely to include transport, power generation, real estate and a range of commodities.</P><P>Through the programme, the researchers will better understand and inform current policy debates, particularly around issues like systemic risk and financial regulation. They aim to create new, robust tools to actively understand and manage the risks of asset stranding. They will also conduct analyses of investor portfolios to build an understanding of risk exposures and develop relevant best practice case studies to inform decision-making.</P><P>Ben Caldecott is a Visiting Fellow at the Smith School and Head of Policy at <mark>Climate Change</mark> Capital, an investment manager and advisory group specialising in the opportunities generated by the transition to a low <mark>carbon</mark> economy. He said: 'The implications of an economy-wide over-exposure to fossil fuel investments could be even more severe and wide-ranging than those of the recent financial crisis. Regulators need to figure out how to make the transition from the old high-<mark>carbon</mark> economy and carefully deflate a bubble in environmentally un<mark>sustainable</mark> assets.'</P><P>The programme is being supported by Aviva Investors, <mark>Bunge</mark> Ltd, <mark>Climate Change</mark> Capital Ltd and HSBC Holdings plc, with non-financial partners including the <mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker Initiative, Trucost and WWF-UK.</P></SPAN></DIV></DIV></SECTION><DIV class=""row""><SECTION class=""page-content-level column page-content-sidebar-first"" id=""page-content-sidebar-first""><DIV id=""block-views-latest-news-block-2"" class=""block block-views block-grey block-views-latest-news-block-2 ""><DIV class=""view-latest-news view-id-latest_news view-display-id-block_2 view-listing view-dom-id-1807cb4bc35c920765883302a8e146a4 has-feed-icon""><DIV class=""view-header""><H2 class=""title"">Latest</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

    </P><P>■ Alberto Weisser was appointed chief executive officer of <mark>Bunge</mark> in
      January 1999 and was elected chairman of the board in May 2001. He had
      joined <mark>Bunge</mark> in July 1993 as its chief financial officer and had been
      elected to the board of directors in 1995. During his years with <mark>Bunge</mark>,
      Weisser helped to expand the conservative, once family-owned agribusiness
      company through numerous key acquisitions, including its largest
      acquisition of the French agribusiness company Cereol in 2003. Though the
      name <mark>Bunge</mark> is scarcely known to the average American, its raw foods go
      into many well-known and popular brands, including products made by
      General Mills, Frito-Lay, Kellogg Company, and Nestlé.
    </P><H2>
      DUTCH FOUNDER
    </H2><P>
      In 1818 Johann Peter Gottlieb <mark>Bunge</mark>, a Dutch grain trader, founded <mark>Bunge</mark>
      in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, as a grain-trading business. The company
      grew to become a leading commodity-trading company within the
      consumer/noncyclical sector of the food-processing industry. The
      company's headquarters was eventually moved south to Rotterdam; in
      1859 it relocated still further south to Antwerp, Belgium. <mark>Bunge</mark> later
      made a major move to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and still later to Sao
      Paulo, Brazil, in both of which countries it capitalized on the rapidly
      growing grain trade.
    </P><P>
      Over the next century descendants of the <mark>Bunge</mark> founder built a thriving
      international business, expanding into North America, Asia, and Australia.
      However, the talented but oldfashioned family management team could not
      compete against the world's emerging multinational corporations.
      Also, the team could not appease the feuding factions of family
      shareholders and could not deal with the changing political <mark>climate</mark> in
      South America. To save the company, outside management was
      recruited—Alberto Weisser was a part of that influx.
    </P><H2>
      BEFORE <mark>BUNGE</mark>
    </H2><P>
      Weisser earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from
      the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil and participated in several
      postgraduate programs at the Harvard Business School in Cambridge,
      Massachusetts. He also attended the Management Development Program at
      INSEAD in Cedex, France. Before his relationship with <mark>Bunge</mark>, Weisser
      worked for 15 years, from 1979 to 1993, in various finance-related
      positions with the German petrochemicals giant BASF in Brazil, Germany,
      the United States, and Mexico.
    </P><P>
      In 1990, with the global marketplace expanding after physical and
      ideological barriers were broken down at the end of the Cold War, the
      family-owned <mark>Bunge</mark> changed its general strategies in order to have access
      to more financial capital and to end the bickering that continued between
      family members. Professional management was brought in beginning in 1992,
      and the company prepared itself to become a publicly traded company in
      order to gain access to equity markets. Weisser joined <mark>Bunge</mark> in July 1993
      as its chief financial officer.
    </P><H2>
      DIRECTING FINANCIAL CHANGE
    </H2><P>
      Weisser immediately began to focus <mark>Bunge</mark> on agribusiness and food
      production while divesting the company of noncore assets. To emphasize the
      trading of soybeans, grain, and fertilizer, Weisser directed the sale of
      all of the company's consumer food-processing firms, except <mark>Bunge</mark>
      Alimentos in Brazil, which dealt with soybeans and margarine.
    </P><P>
      In 1999 Weisser—who had become chairman of the board and chief
      executive officer—moved the company to White Plains, New York, in
      order to be closer to New York City, the center of international finance
      and trade. In August 2001 Weisser listed the now publicly traded <mark>Bunge</mark> on
      the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BG.
    </P><P>
      Weisser concentrated on three principles that he felt would best sharpen
      the company's focus within the agribusiness industry. Knowing that
      <mark>Bunge</mark> needed to grow in order to survive and prosper, he carefully
      acquired companies that matched <mark>Bunge</mark>'s strategic plan; he reduced
      expenses; and he emphasized efficiency. Weisser coordinated ocean
      shipments more concertedly to allow for intermediate pick-up and drop-off
      spots along any particular route, and he implemented the backhauling of
      cargo to its point of origination in order to save costs. Weisser also
      helped to consolidate the company into three main divisions: agribusiness,
      food products, and fertilizers. Integration across the company helped
      <mark>Bunge</mark> to take advantage of the synergies among these divisions; the
      resulting cohesion made <mark>Bunge</mark> an efficient, low-cost
      operator—Weisser's original intent.
    </P><H2>
      AGRIBUSINESS
    </H2><P>
      <mark>Bunge</mark>'s agribusiness division was its largest, accounting for about
      78 percent of sales. The division comprised three subdivisions: grain
      origination, soybean production/oilseed processing, and international
      marketing. Weisser helped <mark>Bunge</mark> to develop processes in which commodities
      such as soybeans and other oilseeds, grown primarily in North and South
      America, were processed as animal feed, food products, and vegetable oil
      in the Americas and in Europe. These operations were about equally divided
      between North America, South America, and Europe, providing a continuous
      supply of raw and processed oilseeds in all locations. <mark>Bunge</mark> Global
      Markets—the international sales and marketing subdivision within
      agribusiness—sold commodities throughout the world, including in
      the largest growth markets: the European Union, China, and India. It
      operated 21 offices in 18 countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas in
      order to provide worldwide coverage to all of the major oil consumption
      markets.
    </P><H2>
      FOOD PRODUCTS
    </H2><P>
      The production of shortenings, edible oils, mayonnaise, and baked goods
      made up the majority of operations within <mark>Bunge</mark>'s food-products
      division. Its subdivisions were origination, processing, and global
      logistics. The food-products division used raw materials and processed
      products from the agribusiness division to reduce overall external
      procurement and logistics costs. Weisser developed this ability to the
      point where almost three-quarters of the raw materials used to manufacture
      these products were sourced from within <mark>Bunge</mark>'s network.
    </P><P>
      With better quality control in place due to the company's ability
      to track foods through the entire production process, Weisser concluded
      that food retailers and food-service providers would be much more likely
      to choose <mark>Bunge</mark> over its competitors. Weisser believed that such an
      integrated process would also provide a safer and more accessible food
      supply.
    </P><H2>
      FERTILIZER
    </H2><P>
      As of 2004 <mark>Bunge</mark> was the only vertically integrated fertilizer producer in
      South America and was Brazil's leading manufacturer and seller of
      fertilizer and phosphate-based animal-feed products. Weisser expanded the
      company's ability to extend credit to farmers in the form of
      fertilizer, which was then repaid with crops, in order to guarantee
      supplies, strengthen relationships, and reduce risks. Further efficiencies
      were instituted when the same transport vehicles imported fertilizers to
      inland elevators and exported grains to ships waiting at coastal ports.
      These strategies and the company's positive relationship with
      Brazilian and Argentine farmers helped <mark>Bunge</mark> maintain a unique and
      dominant position in its South American markets.
    </P><P>
      In 2004 Brazil was the world's fastest-growing fertilizer market,
      increasing at an average rate of 7 percent during the last half of the
      1990s and into the 2000s. Unforested, arable lands were being rapidly
      cultivated for soybean and corn production. Since Brazil had the
      world's largest reserve of such lands, these two crops were
      projected to account for more than 60 percent of the country's
      fertilizer demand between 2005 and 2010. Under the direction of Weisser,
      <mark>Bunge</mark> was poised to take advantage of these future demands.
    </P><H2>
      CEREOL ACQUISITION
    </H2><P>
      The July 2002 acquisition of Cereol, the France-based company also running
      operations in North America and Europe, made <mark>Bunge</mark> the world's
      leading oilseed-processing company, principally processing soybeans,
      canola, rapeseed, and sunflower seed. Cereol was also involved in the
      integrated manufacturing, distribution, and sale of food oils, meals for
      animal nutrition, and food ingredients such as lecithins and proteins. The
      acquisition orchestrated by Weisser increased <mark>Bunge</mark>'s efficiency as
      a result of refined logistics and increased volumes. The deal also
      expanded <mark>Bunge</mark>'s global customers base, enabled the company to
      position itself to maximize its growth rate, increased employee
      opportunities, and resulted in a more stable financial profile due to a
      wider product portfolio. Weisser realized at the time of purchase that the
      Cereol acquisition would help to partially offset the volatile operating
      environment in agribusiness.
    </P><H2>
      SOLAE JOINT VENTURE
    </H2><P>
      In 2003, Weisser directed a joint venture between <mark>Bunge</mark> and DuPont: The
      Solae Company would leverage each company's respective strengths in
      soy protein isolates and concentrates.
       Anticipating the future demand for soybean-based products, Weisser helped
      develop a biotechnology alliance in order to develop enhanced soybeans.
      This technology-based partnership was expected to turn into one of the
      world's leading developers and marketers of branded, soy-based
      specialty-food ingredients.
    </P><H2>
      THE SOYBEAN AND OILSEED COMPANY
    </H2><P>
      In 2004, under the direction of Weisser, <mark>Bunge</mark> produced more bottled salad
      and cooking oils than any company in the world. It was also the leading
      soybean producer in the Americas and was either a regional or
      international producer in everything from animal feed and fertilizers to
      pie fillings and cake mixes. Through its North American subsidiary, <mark>Bunge</mark>
      was a major U.S. food processor. The company operated a variety of
      businesses throughout the world in a number of the most rapidly expanding
      markets, processed one-fifth of the world's soybeans, and
      distributed oilseeds and grains throughout five continents. The
      acquisition of Cereol in 2003 made <mark>Bunge</mark> the world's largest
      oilseed producer, with net sales of $22.165 billion in 2003 and about
      24,000 employees at over four hundred facilities in 29 countries around
      the world. With the help of Weisser, the company became the world's
      leading bottled vegetable oil seller, corn dry miller, and canola oil
      producer; North America's top supplier of edible oil and premium
      shortenings to the foodservice industry and a leading oilseed processor;
      South America's largest wheat miller and vegetable oil producer,
      largest overall exporter of agricultural products, and a leading
      fertilizer producer; Brazil's top manufacturer and seller of flours
      and mixes; Europe's leading supplier of soybean meal;
      China's leading supplier of soybean products; and India's
      leading exporter of soybean oil.
    </P><H2>
      CAPITALIZING ON WORLD DEMAND
    </H2><P>
      Under Weisser's leadership, <mark>Bunge</mark> became well positioned to
      capitalize on the world's growing demand for soybeans and other
      oilseed products. In the past, only one company—Archer Daniels
      Midland Company (ADM)—had dominated the grain-processing market;
      <mark>Bunge</mark> joined ADM in a strong position within the industry. Weisser then
      took a cautious approach in leading <mark>Bunge</mark> into processing expansion around
      the world.
    </P><P>
      The company was already operating in India and Southeast Asia and was
      making some inroads into China. These three areas contained more than 50
      percent of the world's population; Weisser acknowledged that they
      would increasingly demand more of <mark>Bunge</mark>'s products. However,
      Weisser knew that mere expansion for the sake of expansion would not be
      beneficial, so he carefully investigated each country or area to ensure
      expansion would make sense and provide the company with the correct
      opportunities.
    </P><P>
      In China, for instance, Weisser developed a large team that dealt directly
      with customers. Although no processing plants had yet been built there,
      Weisser closely assessed the market, which consisted of about two thousand
      crush factories receiving soybeans from the half billion farmers
      throughout the nation. Weisser expected that opportunities in the market,
      which had a projected annual value of $2 billion, would soon become
      apparent as economic and political factors unfolded. These opportunities
      could come through consolidation, outright purchasing of existing assets,
      or the building of new facilities. In an article with Lyle Niedens,
      Weisser referred to his careful planning of long-term strategies in
      saying, &quot;We have two hundred years of history. We plan to be in
      business another two hundred years, at least&quot; (February 11, 2004).
    </P><H2>
      OUTSIDE FUNCTIONS
    </H2><P>
      Weisser was a member of the board of directors of Ferro Corporation in
      Cleveland, Ohio, a global producer of performance materials for
      manufacturers. He was also a member of the Rabobank North American
      Agribusiness Advisory Board. The advisory board was composed of food and
      agribusiness leaders from academic and research institutions who provided
      guidance on industrial and political developments to Rabobank, a global
      company based in the Netherlands, which provided financial services to
      agribusiness organizations.

Tujivunie Mazingira Yetu Youth Group is a self-help group based in Kilifi.  It was formed in 2011; and registered by the Ministry of Gender and Social Services on 8th August 2011.<SPAN style=""font-weight:bolder;font-size:13pt;color:green;font-family:arial;text-align:left;"">Our Mission</SPAN>
The mission of TMYYG is to enhance the capacity of youths in socio economic development and governance with the vision of an empowered and environmentally aware youth society.  Our values include creativity, respect, integrity and honesty.
<SPAN style=""font-weight:bolder;font-size:13pt;color:green;font-family:arial;text-align:left;"">Our Membership</SPAN>
The group comprises of 35 members (20 female and 15 male) who are young people aged 15 to 33years.  The members are either in school, out of school or are dropouts who are reformed, organized and are focused to protect and sustain the environment</DIV></TD><TD>    </TD><TD width=""400px"" valign=""top""><SPAN style=""font-weight:bolder;font-size:13pt;color:red;font-family:arial;text-align:left;"">Current Projects:</SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight:bolder;font-size:13pt;color:green;font-family:arial;text-align:left;"">Cassava Project:</SPAN>
 The purpose of this project is to create job opportunity for the group members by growing cassava and adding value to the products made from the cassava i.e. making cassava chips and crisps.<SPAN style=""font-weight:bolder;font-size:13pt;color:green;font-family:arial;text-align:left;"">Garbage Collection:  </SPAN>
This is a project which was started in March 2014 in order to create job opportunities for the members after consultation with the Department of Health at the County Government of Kilifi.  The main objective is to reduce garbage disposed at the streets of households located within Mtaani and Kasarani areas.<SPAN style=""font-weight:bolder;font-size:13pt;color:green;font-family:arial;text-align:left;"">Future Projects:</SPAN>
In future the group plans to undertake the following projects; recycling sea weeds and other waste materials to make briquettes, keeping rabbits in order to meet the growing demand of rabbit meat.<SPAN style=""font-weight:bolder;font-size:13pt;color:green;font-family:arial;text-align:left;"">Our partners:</SPAN>

When used as a fuel, wood can come in handy in solid, gas, and liquid form. Woodfuels such as solid firewood and charcoal, wood gas, and liquid bio-oil or bio-ethanol provide one in three households worldwide with energy. That equals 2.4 billion people globally. Woodfuels' primary domestic uses are cooking, heating and boiling water.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""hideBeforeLoad""><DIV class=""teaserContentWrap""><H4>Trees: our green lungs and so much more</H4><H2>Woodfuels as renewable energy</H2><P>Good old forests and the fuels they generate are ancient, yet <mark>sustainable</mark> sources of energy. They account for approximately 40 percent of our global renewable energies. In contrast to fossil fuels, the emissions that are set free into the atmosphere when burning woodfuels are later removed again when trees are planted, because they make use of and store <mark>CO2</mark>.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""hideBeforeLoad""><DIV class=""teaserContentWrap""><H4>Trees: our green lungs and so much more</H4><H2>Smoke is the deadly downside</H2><P>About 50 percent of wood is used for energy purposes each year, mostly just burnt for fuel. This percentage rises to 60 percent in Asia and 90 percent in Africa. But the smoke causes problems, particularly for people's health. 4.3 million people die every year because of indoor air <mark>pollution</mark>. That is more than deaths from malaria, tuberculosis and HIV combined.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""hideBeforeLoad""><DIV class=""teaserContentWrap""><H4>Trees: our green lungs and so much more</H4><H2>Working with wood</H2><P>Woods are an important source of employment. In developing countries, around 883 million people base their livelihoods fully or partly on forests. With new, advanced biofuels picking up, this number could increase - also in developed countries.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""hideBeforeLoad""><DIV class=""teaserContentWrap""><H4>Trees: our green lungs and so much more</H4><H2>From chopped wood to pellets?</H2><P>The popularity of pellets and briquettes has significantly increased over the years - in 2015, 28 million tons were produced. They are not only smaller and easier to handle, they can also be produced from other feedstock, such as grasses or waste-sawdust. Another benefit of the energy carrier: compared to liquid or gas from fossil fuels, pellets are safer to transport.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""hideBeforeLoad""><DIV class=""teaserContentWrap""><H4>Trees: our green lungs and so much more</H4><H2>A shady spot in the sweaty city</H2><P>Wood is only good for heat? Not necessarily. With our planet heating up, trees can also act as coolers. In overheated cities, trees can cool their environment down by up to eight degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit). As a consequence, cooler city air requires less energy for air conditioning in buildings. The trees are working their magic again.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""hideBeforeLoad""><DIV class=""teaserContentWrap""><H4>Trees: our green lungs and so much more</H4><H2>Logging threat to planet's green lungs</H2><P>The rainforest plays a key role in sequestering <mark>CO2</mark>.

These dramatic fluctuations in temperature, and global anoxia that likely coincided with the freezing events <A href=""#pone.0000728-Hoffman2"" class=""ref-tip"">[5]</A>, must have had a pronounced effect on the evolution of biological diversity. Each event probably acted as a powerful natural selection filter, with different events selecting for exactly opposite traits. It is possible that linking the history of paleo<mark>climate</mark> to evolution of biodiversity may help to explain the present pattern of this biodiversity. We are interested in what biodiversity predictions can be made based on the paleo<mark>climate</mark> dynamics, and whether such predictions can be verified. Here we examine a link between the diversity of microbial eukaryotes and paleo<mark>climate</mark> events over the course of their evolution.</P><P>There is increasing evidence that several snowball Earth conditions occurred in the history of our planet (e.g., in the Paleoproterozoic 2.4 billion years ago <A href=""#pone.0000728-Kirschvink2"" class=""ref-tip"">[6]</A>, and more recently in the Neoproterozoic, 710 and 635 million years ago <A href=""#pone.0000728-Hoffman1"" class=""ref-tip"">[2]</A>–<A href=""#pone.0000728-Kirschvink1"" class=""ref-tip"">[3]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0000728-Hoffman2"" class=""ref-tip"">[5]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0000728-Bodiselitsch1"" class=""ref-tip"">[7]</A>), as did the ultra-greenhouse temperatures that likely followed such conditions <A href=""#pone.0000728-Hoffman1"" class=""ref-tip"">[2]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0000728-Hoffman2"" class=""ref-tip"">[5]</A>, and more moderate greenhouse events, the latest of which occurred in the Cenozoic 55 million years ago <A href=""#pone.0000728-Moran1"" class=""ref-tip"">[1]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0000728-Gingerich1"" class=""ref-tip"">[8]</A>. Regardless of when and at what temperature the eukaryotes originated, they must have survived dramatic temperature and oxygen level fluctuations. Extreme cold would obviously select for extreme psychrophiles, making all other organisms less competitive. The opposite would be expected during extreme global warming periods. We postulate that one principal factor determining what kind of biodiversity would survive a cataclysmic shift is the presence or absence of a refuge. Depending on whether or not temperature refuges persisted throughout the history of eukaryotic life, we can envision four scenarios of how paleo<mark>climate</mark> might-and in fact should–have influenced the evolution of microbial eukaryotes:</P><P>1. Refuges did not exist, and temperature extremes reached every corner of the biosphere. If so, neither psychrophiles nor thermophiles would be expected to survive an adverse temperature swing, and would have to evolve anew after each such event.</P><P>2. Only cold refuges persisted through time. If so, today's cold environments would be enriched with basal lineages with a long history of continuous evolution in the cold. Thermophilic lineages of today would be descendants of psychrophiles. Having evolved after the last global freezing event, these lineages would be expected to root within clades of psychrophilic origin.</P><P>3. Only hot refuges persisted through time. This would lead to a scenario opposite to #2: assemblages in hot environments would be enriched with basal lineages, with psychrophiles appearing as evolutionary newcomers.</P><P>4. Both types of refuges continuously existed throughout the history of eukaryotic life. In this case, today both low- and high-temperature environments would be expected to show a diversity of microeukaryotic life, each characterized by its own basal lineages. Continuous evolution of cold adaptations in thermophiles would produce evolutionarily young psychrophilic lineages within clades of thermophilic origin, and vice versa, leading to clades represented by mixes of thermo- and psychrophiles.</P><P>Two additional considerations add to the picture of predicted patterns of microeukaryotic diversity. First, since the snowball Earth was largely anoxic, the majority of survivors must have been obligate and facultative anaerobes. One would expect this to manifest today as a diversity of deeply rooted microbial eukaryotes with anaerobic life style. Second, it is reasonable to expect that older habitats would harbor larger biological richness by providing longer periods of time for this richness to evolve, especially since the diversification rate of microorganisms may have exceeded their extinction rate for billions of years <A href=""#pone.0000728-Martin1"" class=""ref-tip"">[9]</A>. This richness should be distinct from that of a quick explosive origin (<EM>e.g.</EM>, cichlid fish in Africa <A href=""#pone.0000728-Kocher1"" class=""ref-tip"">[10]</A>): the first should appear as a collection of lineages rooted deeply, whereas the second as a number of short lineages branching off from a distinct node of relatively recent origin.</P><P>The four scenarios above are not all equally plausible. The first is the least realistic, because hydrothermal environments have likely been a persistent feature of the ocean floor since the origin of our planet <A href=""#pone.0000728-Miller1"" class=""ref-tip"">[11]</A>. Though rather ephemeral at individual sites, the hydrothermal vent environment in general would still provide a safe harbor for at least a selection of thermophilic (and perhaps some mesophilic) organisms, even at the peaks of the snowball Earth events.</P><P>In contrast, there is little evidence to support the persistence of cold refuges. The paleoceanographic record constructed from a sediment core from a recent drilling expedition in the Arctic Ocean suggests that early Cenozoic was very warm, with polar waters staying above 20°C year round, and no cold deep ocean <A href=""#pone.0000728-Moran1"" class=""ref-tip"">[1]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0000728-Sluijs1"" class=""ref-tip"">[12]</A>. The mid-Cretaceous is also thought to have been exceptionally warm <A href=""#pone.0000728-Jenkyns1"" class=""ref-tip"">[13]</A>–<A href=""#pone.0000728-Wilson1"" class=""ref-tip"">[14]</A>. It appears that cold environments might have been completely–and repeatedly-wiped out during such times, making scenarios 2 and 4 rather unlikely.</P><P>This leaves case 3 as the most plausible, at least in terms of current paleo<mark>climate</mark> views. This scenario implies that microbial eukaryotes at elevated temperatures, such as in hydrothermal vent environments, should be uniquely rich in ancestral lineages, and exhibit a relatively large number of species, especially with anaerobic lifestyle. In contrast, protistan assemblages in cold environments would be expected to have lower species diversity and to be represented by lineages of recent evolutionary origin. The peak of the latest extreme greenhouse event was approximately 55 million years ago <A href=""#pone.0000728-Moran1"" class=""ref-tip"">[1]</A>, and glaciation in the northern hemisphere did not start until 6–10 million years ago <A href=""#pone.0000728-Tripati1"" class=""ref-tip"">[15]</A>. Following the logic of the “center of origin” hypothesis <A href=""#pone.0000728-Fischer1"" class=""ref-tip"">[16]</A>, it seems reasonable to expect that protists from the polar regions, having evolved over that relatively short period of time, would form few (perhaps no) “old” unique clades, and would fall into groups characterized by deeply rooted thermophiles. Here we test these predictions by comparing the 18S rRNA gene diversity in two hydrothermal vent communities (HV1 <A href=""#pone.0000728-Edgcomb1"" class=""ref-tip"">[17]</A> and HV2 <A href=""#pone.0000728-LopezGarcia1"" class=""ref-tip"">[18]</A>), to the diversity in an original dataset we obtained from a tidal flat in the Arctic (DI; Disko Island, Western Greenland). This sediment habitat represents one of the coldest tidal flats studied because it stays ice-free for only 3–4 months a year, with water temperature averaging −1.8°C <A href=""#pone.0000728-Cuny1"" class=""ref-tip"">[19]</A>, and rarely exceeding 4–6°C even on a sunny summer day. For comparative purposes, we include in our analyses the only available 18S rRNA surveys of temperate sediments (WH <A href=""#pone.0000728-Stoeck1"" class=""ref-tip"">[20]</A>, and CA1 and CA2 <A href=""#pone.0000728-Dawson1"" class=""ref-tip"">[21]</A>), as well as one of the best-studied (to date) protistan assemblages from an anoxic system (CB; Cariaco Basin in the Caribbean <A href=""#pone.0000728-Jeon1"" class=""ref-tip"">[22]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0000728-Stoeck2"" class=""ref-tip"">[23]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0000728-Stoeck3"" class=""ref-tip"">[24]</A>). We compare the results of these surveys by examining (1) their respective overall species richness; (2) the presence/absence, phylogeny, and richness of unique clades of high taxonomic order; and (3) the biology of relevant organisms.</P></DIV><DIV id=""section2"" class=""section toc-section""><H2>Results and Discussion</H2><DIV id=""section1"" class=""section toc-section""><H3>Species richness</H3><P>The rRNA surveys in question were of unequal size, and the observed numbers of individual phylotypes detected were not directly comparable. We recently developed a statistical procedure to estimate biological richness based on observed data of this type, and tested it on both prokaryotic and protistan datasets <A href=""#pone.0000728-Jeon1"" class=""ref-tip"">[22]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0000728-Hong1"" class=""ref-tip"">[25]</A>. We applied this approach here to estimate the total richness of the samples from the target communities, which allows a direct comparison between such samples (<A href=""#pone-0000728-t001"">Table 1</A>). We note that the true richness of hydrothermal vent communities may be overestimated here because some of the 18S sequences detected at the richer site (HV1) likely originated from the photic zone of the overlying water column <A href=""#pone.0000728-LopezGarcia1"" class=""ref-tip"">[18]</A>. When the uppermost layer of the sediment was excluded from analyses, the number of allochthonous sequences was reduced <A href=""#pone.0000728-LopezGarcia1"" class=""ref-tip"">[18]</A>. We note that even though this lowered the estimate of total protistan richness (compare HV1 and HV2 in <A href=""#pone-0000728-t001"">Table 1</A>), it remained higher than those for temperate tidal flat. This may appear surprising because the ultimate community food base (i.e., fixed organic material) is likely less diverse and abundant in deep sea than in shallow water environments. However, the apparently higher richness of hydrothermal vent protistan communities can be easily explained if this environment was evolutionarily old, and its inhabitants had a long uninterrupted history of diversification.</P><DIV class=""figure"" data-doi=""10.1371/journal.pone.0000728.t001""><DIV class=""figure-inline-download"">

This contrasts with the prevailing general view that Arctic cold conditions do not favor high biological diversity <A href=""#pone.0000728-Lomolino1"" class=""ref-tip"">[26]</A>, but is tentatively supported by recent findings of a latitudinal increase in eukaryotic soil richness towards the southernmost sampling points in Antarctica <A href=""#pone.0000728-Lawley1"" class=""ref-tip"">[27]</A>. Considering the small size of our sediment sample for DNA extraction (3 g), and the fact that any estimate based on the rRNA approach is conservative due to the well-known PCR and primer biases <A href=""#pone.0000728-Suzuki1"" class=""ref-tip"">[28]</A>, the 605 phylotypes predicted to co-exist in the sample tell a story of notable diversity and richness. A recently detected high diversity of planktonic protists in the Arctic <A href=""#pone.0000728-Lovejoy1"" class=""ref-tip"">[29]</A> lends additional support to our findings.</P><P>While comparing the richness estimates (<A href=""#pone-0000728-t001"">Table 1</A>), we considered several factors that could bias these estimates, thus potentially limiting the usefulness of such comparison.</P><P>1. Different sites were sampled using somewhat different methodologies. Similarly to our research, one of the two temperate tidal flat studies used both anoxic and suboxic parts of the sediment cores <A href=""#pone.0000728-Stoeck1"" class=""ref-tip"">[20]</A>, whereas the second used only the anoxic sediment zone <A href=""#pone.0000728-Dawson1"" class=""ref-tip"">[21]</A>. Nonetheless, the richness estimates are essentially the same between the latter two (<A href=""#pone-0000728-t001"">Table 1</A>), and equally low relative to the one obtained here. This indicates that the presence of aerobic protists in our samples cannot explain the large difference between their richness and that in the temperate samples. This is in line with the growing understanding that protistan diversity in anoxic environments significantly exceeds that of oxic habitats <A href=""#pone.0000728-Behnke1"" class=""ref-tip"">[30]</A>–<A href=""#pone.0000728-Zuendorf1"" class=""ref-tip"">[31]</A>.</P><P>2. Sand binds dissolved DNA <A href=""#pone.0000728-Naviaux1"" class=""ref-tip"">[32]</A>, and the rRNA gene diversity uncovered here might contain signatures of allochthonous species. While there is a good chance this might be the case, the artifact in question is probably characteristic of all sediment works. The temperate and vent sediments considered in our analyses were all micro- to mesoporal sands, and all could be enriched with DNA from nearby sources. While assessing the impact of this artifact, it is important to consider the richness of the contributing sources. Temperate sediments must be influenced by, among other factors, adjacent soils, which are known to be rich in microbial life. In contrast, the contribution of this source in the present study was minimal, as the soils immediately adjacent to the sampling site were barren stony desert, with partial snow cover. The likely higher diversity of allochthonous DNA in temperate sediments makes the observed difference between protistan diversity in temperate vs. Arctic sediments conservative.</P><P>3. The original dataset was obtained using a multiple primer approach, which could detect more protistan rRNA genes than a more traditional single primer approach. This is an important difference between this and some (but not all) published research, and therefore deserves careful analysis. In addition to predicting the DI protistan richness based on pooled clone data (<A href=""#pone-0000728-t001"">Table 1</A>), we conducted separate analyses using rRNA gene sequences obtained with individual PCR primers. Using primer sets D1, 2, and 3 (<A href=""#pone-0000728-t002"">Table 2</A>), we obtained and sequenced 192 clones for each clone library, of which 143, 170, and 138, respectively, produced protistan 18S rRNA gene sequences. We grouped these into OTUs at 99% and 98% rRNA gene sequence identity, and obtained respectively 79 and 62 OTUs for clone D2 and D1 clone libraries, and 52 and 53 OTUs for D1 and D2 clone libraries. We then reconstructed the OTU frequency distribution in the above 4 groups of OTUs, and applied to these frequency distributions the same statistical approach we used with the pooled data (<A href=""#pone-0000728-t001"">Table 1</A>) to produce estimates of total protistan richness. Because these analyses use the data obtained with single primer sets, their results are comparable with those from the majority of published reports.</P><DIV class=""figure"" data-doi=""10.1371/journal.pone.0000728.t002""><DIV class=""figure-inline-download"">

These predictions are: 225±72 (SE) OTUs at 99% level of gene identity based on primer set 3 individual dataset, and 126±42 (SE) and 132±30 (SE) OTUs at 98% level based on primer sets 1 and 2 individual datasets, respectively (the 4<SUP>th</SUP> analysis that used primer set 2 at 99% level OTUs did not produce statistically valid total richness predictions). Though these estimates are substantially lower than those based on the pooled data (<A href=""#pone-0000728-t001"">Table 1</A>), it is important to note that they are higher than an estimate of protistan richness in a temperate tidal flat community <A href=""#pone.0000728-Stoeck1"" class=""ref-tip"">[20]</A>, and twice as high as either of the two anoxic tidal flats we considered <A href=""#pone.0000728-Dawson1"" class=""ref-tip"">[21]</A>, even though the latter study employed a multiple PCR primer approach. The above estimates appear on a par with HV2 and, with sediment communities in mind, are only second to HV1 (<A href=""#pone-0000728-t001"">Table 1</A>). It should be noted, however, that the HV1 data <A href=""#pone.0000728-Edgcomb1"" class=""ref-tip"">[17]</A> contains a significant number of signatures of photosynthetic protists and is believed to be artificially enriched with allochthonous species from the overlying water column <A href=""#pone.0000728-LopezGarcia1"" class=""ref-tip"">[18]</A>. Therefore, the data obtained here, whether considered as a library based on the multiple PCR primer approach, or as a collection of libraries each based on an individual PCR primer, indicate a surprising level of protistan richness in the Arctic community.</P><P>We conclude that the evidence for this richness is not due to methodological differences between this and prior studies of 18S rRNA gene diversity in sediment communities, but rather points to the Polar environment as a “hot spot” of protistan biodiversity.

For example, apicomplexans are represented remarkably well in our Arctic clone libraries and constituted over 12% of all unique protistan rRNA gene sequences. This proportion is the highest ever recorded; it exceeds the second highest by 5-fold (2.4%; temperate intertidal community <A href=""#pone.0000728-Dawson1"" class=""ref-tip"">[21]</A>). Further statistical analyses estimated the total number of distinct apicomplexan OTUs (&gt;99% sequence identity) at the Arctic site to be 174±60, exceeding the entire protistan richness at any of the three temperate tidal flats studied to date (<A href=""#pone-0000728-t001"">Table 1</A>). Perhaps even more importantly, a number of the Arctic apicomplexan lineages are deeply rooted within the clade (<A href=""#pone-0000728-g002"">Figure 2</A>), which makes the hypothesis of their recent diversification implausible.</P><P>Similarly, chytrid fungi, absent from the hydrothermal or temperate sediment sites studied so far, were well represented in the DI data and constituted almost 5% of all unique 18S rRNA gene sequences detected there. We estimated the total number of OTUs (&gt;99% sequence identity) of all fungi to be 60±22; the data on chytrid fungi alone was insufficient for direct richness estimation, but a conservative lower bound (based on the equal-OTU-abundance or unmixed Poisson model) for the number of chytrid fungi OTUs was 14±2. Interestingly, the only other study of 18S rRNA gene diversity in a polar terrestrial environment (Antarctic soil, <A href=""#pone.0000728-Lawley1"" class=""ref-tip"">[27]</A>) also noted an elevated diversity of chytrid fungi. Similarly to apicomplexans, chytrid lineages uncovered here do not seem to be a result of recent radiation: they either form novel sister clades to the known chytrids, or appear ancestral to them (<A href=""#pone-0000728-g009"">Figure 9</A>).</P><P>Jakobid-like organisms showed a strong presence in Arctic as well, constituting over 5% of all unique 18S rRNA sequences (<A href=""#pone-0000728-g003"">Figure 3</A>). However, they are notably absent at hydrothermal sites. Also noteworthy is a substantial diversity of Labyrinthulida in the DI data, some of which appear ancestral to the Labyrinthulids detected at hydrothermal vent sites (<A href=""#pone-0000728-g004"">Figure 4</A>).</P><P>We note that those clades that appear disproportionately rich in the Arctic are also evolutionarily older. Labyrinthulids are almost certainly ancestral to one of the largest protistan clades, Stramenopiles <A href=""#pone.0000728-Leipe1"" class=""ref-tip"">[36]</A>. Chytrids are undoubtedly primitive and are thought to be ancestral to Fungi <A href=""#pone.0000728-Steenkamp1"" class=""ref-tip"">[37]</A>. Apicomplexans possess a specialized apical complex suggesting their derived nature, but other ultrastructural characteristics point to their position as ancestral to another large eukaryotic clade, the Alveolates <A href=""#pone.0000728-Kuvardina1"" class=""ref-tip"">[38]</A>–<A href=""#pone.0000728-Leander1"" class=""ref-tip"">[39]</A>. Most interestingly, Jakobids are characterized by the most bacteria-like mitochondrial genome known, and are regarded as the most ancestral mitochondria-bearing eukaryotes <A href=""#pone.0000728-Gray1"" class=""ref-tip"">[40]</A>–<A href=""#pone.0000728-OKelly1"" class=""ref-tip"">[42]</A>. Collectively, Stramenopiles, Alveolates, Fungi, and Jakobids represent a substantial part of the entire eukaryotic diversity known today, and finding an extensive richness of their ancestral lineages in one community identifies this community as an important target for future efforts, and potentially informative for reconstructing eukaryotic evolution.</P><P>This comparative phylogenetic analysis leads to an inescapable conclusion: not only does the Arctic appear to be a “hot spot” of protistan biodiversity, but it is also notably rich in lineages ancestral to several principal eukaryotic clades, if not to the eukaryotes in general. It seems unlikely that communities with such traits are evolutionarily young and derived (<EM>e.g.</EM>, from thermophiles). A simpler explanation is that communities in the cold environment of the Arctic have been evolving in this or a similar environment for a substantial period of time, possibly comparable to the age of eukaryotes. This suggests that cold refuges might have persisted even through the warmest periods of the last one to two billion years, which is in conflict with the current view on the extent of global warming episodes (<A href=""#pone.0000728-Moran1"" class=""ref-tip"">[1]</A>, but see also <A href=""#pone.0000728-Ahlberg1"" class=""ref-tip"">[43]</A>).</P></DIV><DIV id=""section3"" class=""section toc-section""><H3>Biology of Arctic microbial eukaryotes</H3><P>The four clades that are significantly–if not uniquely–rich in the Arctic sediment clone libraries are Apicomplexans, Chytrids, Labyrinthulids, and Jakobids. All these organisms are heterotrophs; many are saprophytes or parasites. Interpreting these observations meets with two difficulties.</P><P>First, the source of organic material necessary to support such a diversity of heterotrophs is not obvious. Autochthonous material is a doubtful source of organics given the uncharacteristically low number of autotrophic protists detected. Seaweeds are typically absent from Arctic tidal flats because of the action of winter ice. Diatoms and uncultured alveolates, which are ubiquitous components of the water column communities, mayrepresent a potential source of <mark>carbon</mark>, but this is hypothetical as our (sediment) dataset contains few to no signatures of these organisms. The source of allochthonous energy supply is also unclear. The sampling site is surrounded by a stony arctic desert with small patches of high latitude tundra, an unlikely supplier of organic material. By exclusion, this leads to subtidal fields of seaweeds, dominated principally by brown and red algae of substantial diversity (over 100 species in Greenland, <A href=""#pone.0000728-Jensen1"" class=""ref-tip"">[44]</A>), as potential suppliers of <mark>carbon</mark>. We hypothesize that algal biomass which has washed ashore, together with drift seaweeds, constitute an important source of “missing” energy. This would explain why so many of the protists detected belong to groups rich in saprophytes (<EM>e.g.,</EM> Chytrids, Labyrinthulids).</P><P>The second difficulty is to explain an unparalleled richness of Apicomplexans, a group with very few known free-living representatives. We hypothesize that the apicomplexan life cycle, which includes resilient cysts, makes this group particularly competitive, and thus particularly successful, in the harsh environment of the Arctic. However, this cannot expect the puzzling aspect of high apicomplexan diversity because the Arctic has a low diversity of prospective hosts (animals, primarily mammals). Benthic macrofauna is also known to decrease in diversity in the northern direction <A href=""#pone.0000728-Fischer1"" class=""ref-tip"">[16]</A>, and it is reasonable to think the diversity of their parasites would mirror the trend. If so, the diversity of parasitic apicomplexans and chytrids would be expected to be higher in the temperate zone, not in Disko Bay. Our data show a strong opposite trend. The simplest explanation is that our rRNA survey detected a diversity of previously unknown free-living Apicomplexans and chytrids. Some of them may be close to the free-living ancestor of the present day parasitic forms, which is line with our finding deeply rooted apicomplexan and chytrid lineages. This is also indirectly supported by our detection of several 18S rRNA gene sequences related to <EM>Colpodella</EM>, a rare example of free-living apicomplexan, which is thought to be ancestral to the clade <A href=""#pone.0000728-Leander2"" class=""ref-tip"">[45]</A>–<A href=""#pone.0000728-Simpson1"" class=""ref-tip"">[46]</A>.</P><P>One important common theme in the biology of species from the four clades in question is their energy metabolism. The few Apicomplexans studied in this regard rely principally on substrate level phosphorylation at least at some stages of their life cycles (cf., <EM>Plasmodium</EM>, <A href=""#pone.0000728-Cameron1"" class=""ref-tip"">[47]</A>), and some are thought to lack the full complement of the TCA cycle <A href=""#pone.0000728-LangUnnasch1"" class=""ref-tip"">[48]</A>. Chytrids are among the few eukaryotes possessing hydrogenosomes in place of mitochondria <A href=""#pone.0000728-Akhmanova1"" class=""ref-tip"">[49]</A>–<A href=""#pone.0000728-Voncken1"" class=""ref-tip"">[50]</A>, and are almost certainly anaerobes. There is virtually no information on bioenergetics of Labyrinthulids and Jakobids, but both groups are often found in anoxic environments <A href=""#pone.0000728-Edgcomb1"" class=""ref-tip"">[17]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0000728-Stoeck1"" class=""ref-tip"">[20]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0000728-Stoeck2"" class=""ref-tip"">[23]</A>–<A href=""#pone.0000728-Stoeck3"" class=""ref-tip"">[24]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0000728-Behnke1"" class=""ref-tip"">[30]</A>. This leads us to conclude that the Arctic protistan community studied exhibits an elevated richness of cold-adapted, ancestral protistan lineages with anaerobic/microaerophilic life styles. This is in line with an accepted view that snowball Earth events coincided with global anoxia <A href=""#pone.0000728-Hoffman2"" class=""ref-tip"">[5]</A>, and the idea that cold environments have been a persistent feature of our planet for at least a part of eukaryotic evolution.</P><P>In conclusion, we identified the cold environment of the Arctic as a “hot spot” of protistan biodiversity rich in evolutionarily old lineages. The communities of microbial eukaryotes in temperate habitats appear less diverse and not as rich. Polar environments therefore hold a high potential for future research on microbial discovery. To account for the observed biodiversity patterns, we postulate that cold refuges have persisted throughout the history of eukaryotic evolution, which is in conflict with some current views on the extent of past global warming events.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""section3"" class=""section toc-section""><H2>Materials and Methods</H2><DIV id=""section1"" class=""section toc-section""><H3>Study site and sampling</H3><P>Sediment samples were collected in July 2003 in Unqussivik, a small bay on Disko Island, Greenland (69°26′03″N; 54°14′13″W).

Datasets of this type typically have long right tails; we therefore fit every model to every right-truncated subset of each dataset. For each subset we compare models using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC); across subsets we compare models using an asymptotically-corrected Pearson chi-square goodness-of-fit statistic.

Globally, 366 companies worth $2.9 trillion have <A href=""http://forest-trends.org/releases/p/supply_change_2016"">committed</A> to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains, but they need better information to make good on their commitments.</P><P>The partnership will focus on building a global decision-support tool to increase transparency and traceability across supply chains.</P><P>Led by the <A href=""http://www.wri.org/"">World Resources Institute</A>’s Global Forest Watch team, partners include <mark>Bunge</mark>, Cargill, Carrefour, Conservation International, Daemeter, GIZ - Die Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, Envol Vert, IOI Group, Mars, Mondelēz International, IDH–The <mark>Sustainable</mark> Trade Initiative, the Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC/IDB), FMO–Dutch Development Bank, National Wildlife Federation, Rainforest Alliance, Proforest, The Nature Conservancy, Transitions and Walmart.  It will also contribute to achieving the zero-deforestation goals of the World Economic Forum-convened Tropical Forest Alliance 2020, Consumer Goods Forum, Banking Environmental Initiative, and more.</P><P>The tool will build on the technology and methods developed by WRI on the <A href=""http://commodities.globalforestwatch.org/"">Global Forest Watch Commodities</A> platform, which currently allows companies to evaluate supply chain risk through high-resolution maps of tree cover loss, near-real-time deforestation and fire alerts, and analysis of individual mills and farms. The new tool will not only be a source of information, but a fully operational management system.</P><P>“Walmart aspires to preserve natural resources through conservation and restoration, working with suppliers, industry forums, nonprofit organizations, farmers and governments through business and philanthropic initiatives,” said <STRONG>Kathleen McLaughlin, Senior Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc</STRONG>. “We have committed to sourcing 20 commodities more sustainably and are resolved to achieve zero net deforestation by 2020 in palm, beef, soy and pulp/paper.  The development of <mark>innovation</mark>s and technologies like the Global Forest Watch Commodities tool can help us and others achieve such goals.”</P><P>Deforestation presents a major risk to businesses, especially those with large agricultural supply chains, and investors are increasingly aware of risks to their portfolios. Agriculture accounts for <A href=""http://www.forest-trends.org/documents/files/doc_4718.pdf"">more than 70 percent</A> of tropical deforestation as forests are cleared for plantations, pastures and farmland. Deforestation can present <A href=""https://news.mongabay.com/2016/12/companies-are-underestimating-the-risks-of-deforestation-in-their-commodities-supply-chains/"">legal and reputational risks</A> for companies if they source commodities from protected areas or land with disputed ownership. Companies that effectively protect forests while supporting local communities, however, can benefit from a more secure and <mark>sustainable</mark> supply of materials while preserving ecosystem functions that underpin productive agriculture.</P><P>The new and improved tool will expand GFW Commodities to become the go-to online system to utilize the power of satellite monitoring to track and manage forest-related sustainability performance. It will incorporate functions that allow banks and financial institutions to evaluate deforestation risk in their commodity investments. The new application will enable a company or bank to plot the location of thousands of production mills, farms or municipalities; access alerts and dashboards to track issues such as tree cover loss and fires occurring in those areas; and inform decisions to mitigate or eliminate issues. Key functionality will incorporate agricultural sustainability data and tools into companies’ existing platforms, while keeping their proprietary information secure.</P><P>Through this new approach, companies and banks will be able to integrate forest monitoring into their core business strategy the same way they track commodity prices or stock markets. The partnership’s vision over the long term is to draw on its members’ wide-ranging expertise to monitor other areas of sustainability, from water stress to labor and human rights issues. Over the next year, the partners will provide input into the design of the new tool and may test it across their supply chains.</P><P>Mars, Unilever, Cargill and Mondelēz are already using GFW Commodities to assess deforestation risks in their palm oil, soy and cocoa supply chains across a collective area of land the size of Mexico. 
“Over the last year, Cargill partnered with WRI and GFW to help us establish a baseline for tree cover loss in our supply chains from which to measure our progress forward,&quot; said <STRONG>Mark Murphy, Assistant Vice President, Sustainability-Corporate Affairs, Cargill, Inc</STRONG>. “We are proud to join this new initiative to expand GFW’s leading tools and advance a common framework to help all stakeholders better measure and monitor progress to protect forests.”</P><P>Delivered through an easy-to-use design, the new platform will allow decision makers to prioritize certain geographic areas to fight deforestation where it is needed most, such as by certifying <mark>sustainable</mark> operations, partnering up with local communities or buying from producers who are sourcing from areas using <mark>sustainable</mark> practices. Such technology will also generate business opportunities by, for example, allowing trading companies to identify where their operations are geographically concentrated or enabling financial institutions to create new green credit lines.</P><P>“We already understand the need to combat deforestation in order to protect natural capital, curb <mark>climate change</mark> and sustainably feed the world. The political will is there,” said <STRONG>Andrew Steer, President and CEO, World Resources Institute.</STRONG> “Now is the time to use the power of information technology to meet those goals, while also generating <mark>sustainable</mark> business opportunities. That could really change the world.”</P><P>Companies interested in previewing or testing the tool can email <A href=""gfwcommodities@wri.org"">gfwcommodities@wri.org</A></P><P>Press Contact: James Anderson, Communications Manager, Forest Program; <A href=""janderson@wri.org"">janderson@wri.org</A>; +1 (202) 729-7608</P><P><STRONG>ADDITIONAL QUOTES</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Luiz Gabriel Azevedo, Chief, Environment, Social &amp; Governance Division, the Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC/IDB):</STRONG></P><P>&quot;Biodiversity is one of Latin America’s greatest assets and its protection is paramount for the IIC. The Global Forest Watch platform allows us and our clients to monitor forest cover change and better ensure <mark>sustainable</mark> land management, particularly among the finance and agribusiness sectors. It provides a remarkably powerful risk management tool.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Andreas Brede, Advisor to <mark>Sustainable</mark> Value Chains and Standards program, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ):</STRONG></P><P>“Transparency and traceability are essential aspects to verify deforestation-free commodity production so we welcome the new approach proposed by this partnership. Spatial data provides the foundation on which to understand the influence of sustainability efforts in agricultural production and forestry within a given jurisdiction. We believe that the proposed tool can contribute to ensuring the protection of natural forests and other highly valuable ecosystems, strengthen jurisdictional approaches and provide evidence that forest protection and agricultural supply chain development can go hand in hand.”</P><P><STRONG>Linda Broekhuizen, Chief Investment Officer, FMO:</STRONG></P><P>&quot;The new GFW tool enables not only traditional supply chain actors, but also those financing supply chains, to systematically control their exposure to deforestation, and the related risks, from behind a computer screen. This is a game changer; for FMO, nowhere more so that in Paraguay, where we are working with our financial sector clients and partners to understand, control and ideally reduce their deforestation exposure. The tool has also been adopted by one of FMO’s clients in the agricultural sector and we are planning to introduce it to banks and supply chain actors in other countries, following the positive experience in Paraguay.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>David Cleary, Director of Agriculture, The Nature Conservancy:</STRONG></P><P>“A deforestation commitment immediately raises the question of where agricultural expansion happens after forests are off the table. We see the proposed tool as an important global framework into which our ongoing work on decision-support systems at a more local level in countries like Brazil and Paraguay can fit. This new approach will help ensure that companies can address the root causes of ecosystem degradation and ensure that better protections for forests doesn’t lead to higher conversion of other important ecosystems like grasslands.”</P><P><STRONG>Thibault Gravier, Associate Director, Transitions:</STRONG></P><P>“The new GFW platform will not only allow corporates to identify and monitor the hotspots of their supply chain in real-time, it will also empower them with the corresponding leverages to promote transformation towards <mark>sustainable</mark> landscapes. Transitions is very supportive of this tool, which contributes to harmonizing complex supply chain and risk management data. We see this as a great step forward to facilitate alignment of all stakeholders on the verification and reporting on no deforestation and <mark>sustainable</mark> sourcing commitments.”</P><P><STRONG>David Pendlington, Senior Chocolate <mark>Sustainable</mark> Sourcing Manager, Mars Chocolate:</STRONG></P><P>&quot;At Mars we are committed to creating <mark>sustainable</mark> palm supply chains and transparency is crucial to help achieve this.  Global Forest Watch Commodities’ risk analysis tool has been instrumental in our supplier engagement and helped bring consistency to our tendering process. In addition the redesigned GFW platform will help us to build new collaboration opportunities with our peers and others to co-create solutions using science-based evidence.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Paulo Pianez, Sustainability Director, Carrefour Brazil:</STRONG></P><P>&quot;Biodiversity protection and <mark>climate</mark> preservation are part of Carrefour Group’s global sustainability action plan. In this context, the company has committed to zero deforestation by 2020, a 40% reduction in <mark>CO2</mark> emissions by 2025 and a 70% reduction by 2050.  Carrefour is aware that land use is an important factor in deforestation and <mark>CO2</mark> emissions and is fully mobilized with its partners and stakeholders to develop collective solutions combining production, conservation and restoration. Our new partner, GFW, is an efficient monitoring and controlling instrument, that tackles the causes of biodiversity loss, such as deforestation and <mark>CO2</mark> emissions, especially in Brazil. Fighting deforestation is a collective challenge that also involves our clients, and traceability is a key tool to leverage those solutions and to achieve real transformation.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Nigel Sizer, President, Rainforest Alliance:</STRONG></P><P>“Rainforest Alliance is proud to be part of this initiative to better harness emerging technology and real-time systems to support corporate supply chain integrity and accountability.  This is great for the companies, forests, communities and <mark>climate</mark>.”</P><P><STRONG>Daisy Tarrier, President, Envol Vert:</STRONG></P><P>&quot;Deforestation is a complex issue which leads to biodiversity loss, social impacts and <mark>climate change</mark>. After years of common concern without concrete results, we realize that we can only address it through collaboration. Agreeing to open-data sharing is just the first mandatory step before collaborative action can take place.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Daan Wensing, Global Director of Landscapes Program &amp; Deforestation Commodities, IDH:</STRONG></P><P>“This tool will potentially help banks, investors, companies and organisations around the world make better decisions, be it on making smarter investments, eliminating deforestation or procuring from <mark>sustainable</mark> sources. At IDH we work with all these private, public and financial sectors to safeguard forests while boosting Green Growth in critical areas. This requires sound data to make impactful investment possible. We believe that GFWC 2.0 will help us and our partners make investment decisions based on the most up-to-date data and monitor progress on public and private impact.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""block block--callout""><H3 class=""block-title"">Contact</H3></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The program has served as a catalyst for one million Kenyan youth, age 18 - 35, to organize themselves in 15,000 village <mark>bunge</mark>s, or youth parliaments. The Mariaini Village <mark>bunge</mark> in Central Kenya is representative of the transformative effect <mark>bunge</mark>s are having on communities across Kenya. <mark>Bunge</mark>s create livelihoods for unemployed youth, the foster community service and they help youth coalesce to find common solutions to common youth problems.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>George Ngethe, 25, is the chair of the local youth group here or <mark>bunge</mark>, Swahili for parliament.

We have influence.”</P><P>The village, Ngethe and almost 50 other youth belonging to the Mariaini Pamoja <mark>Bunge</mark> are on the brink of a major transformation by USAID’s largest youth program in the world. Since 2011, under the rallying cry “Yes Youth Can,” more than 700,000 young people from thousands of villages have come together across ethnic, linguistic, religious and cultural lines to become youth <mark>bunge</mark> members. So far, 15,000 village-level youth <mark>bunge</mark>s are officially registered with the Government of Kenya as self-help groups.

	A Youth Elixir to Election Violence</H3><P>USAID introduced the <mark>bunge</mark> model based on significant research into the causes of Kenya’s post-election violence during 2007 and 2008, where youth were both victims and perpetrators. “The research showed that youth had no confidence in civil society or in the existing public or private institutions in Kenya. They wanted to run their own organizations and to help strengthen Kenya’s post-election recovery. Simply put, they wanted to be empowered,” says Dwaine Lee, director of the Education and Youth Office at USAID/Kenya.</P><DIV class=""right-small"" style=""float: right; ""><DIV class=""ds-1col node node-image view-mode-node_embed clearfix ""><DIV class=""field field-name-field-image-credit field-type-text field-label-hidden""><DIV class=""field-items""><DIV class=""field-item even"">credit: Nichole Sobecki, USAID </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>The Kenyan Government officially defines youth as 18 to 35 years old. Out of a national population that numbered 40 million in the 2009 census, over a third are youth and the vast majority—like Ngethe and his fellow <mark>bunge</mark> members—are out of school with no regular work or income, and are vulnerable to recruitment into political campaigns and criminal gangs. Nearly 2.5 million young people are unemployed and barely 125,000 are absorbed annually into formal employment.</P></DIV><P>“Youth are critical to Kenya’s future political and economic stability. With national and local elections coming in March 2013, it is urgent for youth to coalesce around what they need and expect from Kenya’s elected leaders,” says Ahmed Issack Hassan, chairman of the Kenya Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.</P><H3>
	“We Are the Majority”</H3><P><mark>Bunge</mark>s motivate youth to improve their own communities with the resources they have in their villages and to use these assets as leverage to build new partnerships with donors, private businesses and government agencies. Youth elect their own leaders at the village level as well as individuals to represent them at the county level and to become members of the National Youth <mark>Bunge</mark> Association.</P><P>Berem Risper, 27, is the county <mark>bunge</mark> forum president from Elgeyo-Marakwet. A lecturer with a Ph.D. in economics, Risper represents the talent and leadership that the <mark>bunge</mark> movement has attracted.</P><P>“We are the majority,” she said. “I learned that we can mobilize a mass of youth and that we can solve our own problems. We have unique solutions to our unique problems. But we can also be a time-bomb …. We are tired of the same old promises from Kenyan politicians. They just keep on talking and never do anything.”</P><P>A critical part of the success of the program, which is implemented nationally by Mercy Corps, is the ability of youth to gain the support of local government officials, in particular the village chiefs. In Mariaini, Stephen Kio, the sub-location chief, is a huge fan of the local <mark>bunge</mark>.</P><DIV class=""token-img-right"" style=""float:right;""><H3>

I’ve seen that the youth have been given a future.”</P><P>Mariaini shares similar problems with many other Kenyan villages: dire poverty, serious alcohol and drug abuse and, in the current election cycle, a stream of politicians prepared to rent a crowd for their rallies and buy votes.</P><P>Since joining the <mark>bunge</mark>s and participating in discussions about their future and their role in their communities, many members are creating their own jobs. In addition to the tea seedlings they cultivate, members run a village “milk bar” in a tiny room on Mariaini’s only street. The milk bar is a source of income and provides a market that never existed before: Farmers have a place to sell their surplus milk, and families without cows have a place to purchase milk.</P><DIV class=""right-small"" style=""float: right; ""><DIV class=""ds-1col node node-image view-mode-node_embed clearfix ""><DIV class=""field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden""><DIV class=""field-items""><DIV class=""field-item even"">Anastasia Kairu, 24, feels empowered by her ability to compete with men at the <mark>bunge</mark>’s dart hall.

	The Ripple Effect</H3><P>But the youth don’t only work within their small village world. The Mariaini <mark>bunge</mark> is also participating in a Kenya-wide, youth-led campaign that is mobilizing youth across ethnic, linguistic, religious and cultural divisions. An estimated 5 million of Kenya’s 12 million youth do not have national identity cards. Without these ID cards, they cannot apply for a formal job, open a bank account, access mobile money transfer systems, enter a government building or vote. USAID, in partnership with the Government of Kenya’s National Registration Bureau, has launched My ID My Life to mobilize youth across the country to assist their peers in navigating the complex ID application world.</P><P>The campaign has become a focal activity for <mark>bunge</mark>s across Kenya. In Mariaini, Ngethe’s mobile phone number is penned in on My ID My Life posters. The posters are displayed on almost every wall on the main street—including the local latrines. The Mariaini youth coordinated with their regional district registration officer to bring a mobile ID registration unit to their village, registering over 30 youth in one afternoon. They are planning another ID drive before the voter registration period ends in October.</P><P>In the near future, <mark>bunge</mark> members will be invited to support voter registration, train as election observers and help organize community peace-building forums.</P><P>In Mariaini, one of the proudest people is the village chief.</P><P>“In the years to come, we are going to produce leaders and we’ll have a better community tomorrow,” Stephen Kio insists. “My administrative work will become easier and I’ll be sleeping very comfortably because I’ll have a better population, more informed and also more economically empowered.”</P><P>In Mariaini and across Kenya, youth now believe they can change society.</P><P>“USAID has helped us mobilize youth,” says Risper, the Elgeyo-Marakwet County Forum president. “It has had a huge impact. We have never had such a forum before.”</P><P>Mercy Corps, NCBA CLUSA, Winrock International, World Vision and Inuka implement this program in different regions of Kenya.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""supplemental-article group-frontlines-supplemental""><H3>A Green Thumb Knows No Disability  </H3><DIV class=""field field-name-field-supplemental-article-summa""><P>By Clara Kakai</P><P>John Nyanjui is 28 years old and has an intellectual disability. As the time to graduate from vocational school approached, he worried he would have nowhere to go. Having come from a poor background, jobless and living in a society that can stigmatize people who are different, Nyanjui was uncertain about his future.</P><P>Youth unemployment makes up 70 percent of total unemployment in Kenya, according to the 2012 African Economic Outlook. Nyanjui would need to compete in an already stretched job market.</P><P>Despite his disability, Nyanjui is energetic and able. Before graduating in February, he discovered a new interest that turned his fortunes around. As part of vocational training, he and some of his friends learned gardening skills by helping with a newly launched school garden. With this new skill, Nyanjui landed a permanent job on the same school farm where he received training, and is now providing vocational training to a new generation of students.</P><P>This is all thanks to the USAID-funded Nutrition Kitchen Garden Program launched in October 2011 at Maria Magdalena Catholic Parish School in Thika. The school cares for the special needs of 110 children with intellectual and developmental disabilities between ages 15 and 29 and aims to help students be independent adults by equipping them with skills like masonry, beading and tailoring.</P><P>Real Impact, the Kenyan NGO that runs the program, has helped the school start and run a full-fledged garden where Nyanjui and his colleagues have been cultivating cabbages, pumpkin, fruit trees, bananas, sweet potatoes, carrots, amaranth, bananas, onions and a variety of other vegetables.</P><P>The effort is also part of the U.S Government’s Feed the Future initiative and targets marginalized groups like women and youth to help them become self-employed and financially independent, and to curb malnutrition and the need for relief food.</P><P>Children with disabilities are particularly vulnerable; many of them experience abandonment, abuse and exclusion from society. The Kenya Government Policy Framework for Education estimates that a quarter of the over 3 million people with special needs in Kenya are school-age children. Only 12 percent of these children have been properly assessed, and only 3 percent have any access to care and rehabilitation services. As a result, they also have few prospects of learning skills that can lead to employment and self-reliance. This means that they often remain dependent with a low quality of life – which just might explain why Nyanjui cannot hide his joy.</P><P>“I am very grateful for this job because I can now prove to everyone that disability is not inability. Now I can meet my own needs and even send something back home every now and then,” he says.</P><P>Thirty-two of his peers have also found new hope through this USAID program. Through the gardening skills acquired they can now find employment or cultivate their own gardens for food and income.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P class=""last-updated""> Last updated: October 13, 2017</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""grid-6 region region-sidebar-second  omega "" id=""region-sidebar-second""><DIV class=""region-inner region-sidebar-second-inner""><DIV class=""wrapper-views""><DIV class=""block block-views block-47136209b69cbe7839614c35289b9729 block-views-47136209b69cbe7839614c35289b9729 odd"" id=""block-views-47136209b69cbe7839614c35289b9729""><DIV class=""block-inner clearfix""><H2 class=""block-title"">Back Issues</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
