The country’s investment environment is still challenging; complex regulations, economic turmoil, and the unstable political <mark>climate</mark> elevate the risk of doing business in Brazil. Nevertheless, EI expects that the combination of recent regulatory changes, the impressive size of the Brazilian pre-salt oil reserves, and their low breakevens that touch USD35/bbl will be enough to incentivize upstream operators and lead to over 2 MMb/d of pre-salt oil production by 2025 in a USD70/bbl oil world. The downstream refinery industry also has the potential to see traction, thanks to the undersupply of existing refinery capacity versus local product demand. Yet due to the risk associated with refining lead time, growth in the downstream will heavily depend on the government continuing to pursue market-friendly policies for an extended period of time.</P><H2>Upstream industry status-quo overhaul</H2><P>For upstream operators, Brazil has been a hotspot this decade. The country’s high-productivity pre-salt resources have proven to have high initial production rates, shallow decline rates, and low water breakthrough. In the last 4 years, production from pre-salt has already surpassed the 1 MMb/d mark, with wellhead breakevens resting as low as USD35/bbl. Costs have decreased as <mark>Petrobras</mark>, the preeminent pre-salt <G class=""gr_ gr_166 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_disable_anim_appear gr_inline_cards Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep"" id=""166"" data-gr-id=""166"">operator,</G> has developed a better understanding of the time, technology, and money necessary to properly develop a pre-salt field.</P><H4>Exhibit 1: Costs on pre-salt projects have been decreasing as the technology and understanding of the geological layer matures</H4><H6>Source: <mark>Petrobras</mark></H6><P>The pre-salt reserves are vast. The Santos basin, where all the major pre-salt fields are found today, was estimated by ANP to hold over 5.6 billion barrels of oil of proved reserves at the end of 2015. <mark>Petrobras</mark> alone is expected to deploy an additional 18 FPSOs in its offshore pre-salt region by 2020.</P><P>Until recently, the pre-salt story was a <mark>Petrobras</mark> story; a local law stipulated that only <mark>Petrobras</mark> could operate the pre-salt fields. Yet Brazil’s pre-salt operatorship law (Bill 131/2015) was overhauled in October, in an effort started by the previous government and finished by Michel <G class=""gr_ gr_151 gr-alert gr_spell gr_disable_anim_appear gr_inline_cards ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace"" id=""151"" data-gr-id=""151"">Temer’s</G> administration. The regulation overhaul opened up the country’s pre-salt resource through two access routes for E&amp;P companies. First, fields that <mark>Petrobras</mark> is not interested in developing become directly available to other players through an auction. Second, operators can now also directly purchase fields from <mark>Petrobras</mark> that the NOC is not interested in developing or operating anymore.</P><P>Given <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ inability to successfully develop all its pre-salt due to its mounting debt, which stood at USD126 Bn as of Q2 2016, the opening up of pre-salt to operators other than <mark>Petrobras</mark> presents a considerable number of attractive asset acquisition targets. On top of potential new fields that will be auctioned by the government, the company has laid out an ambitious divestment program. It has already sold ~USD4.6 Bn in upstream assets out of USD15.2 Bn <G class=""gr_ gr_299 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim gr_inline_cards Grammar multiReplace"" id=""299"" data-gr-id=""299"">in</G> the 15/16 plan and has announced plans to sell an additional USD19.5 Bn for the 17/18 period, although it is not specified what part would be E&amp;P.</P><H2>Downstream industry margins</H2><P>Brazil has a complicated and <G class=""gr_ gr_318 gr-alert gr_spell gr_run_anim gr_inline_cards ContextualSpelling multiReplace"" id=""318"" data-gr-id=""318"">much publicized</G> refinery industry. Theoretically, it could be called an economically promising market, as the country lacks adequate refining capacity despite its rising demand for refined products and availability of feedstock. Delays in the construction of additional refinery capacity by <mark>Petrobras</mark> have resulted in Brazil being long on crude but short on products, despite the economic recession. In 2016, the demand for light and mid-distillates surpassed available conversion capacity by more than 1.1 MMb/d, while oil and NGL production exceeded distillation capacity by 0.3 MMb/d. Yet while the market has not been regulated since 1997, the ownership of the logistic infrastructure by <mark>Petrobras</mark> had previously effectively discouraged competition. Before the recent economic crisis, it was common for <mark>Petrobras</mark> to align its product pricing with government policies, further complicating new market entries.</P><P>Nevertheless, as of October 2016, <mark>Petrobras</mark>, the owner of the vast majority of refinery capacity in Brazil, announced that it will price its fuels closer to international market rates instead of adhering to artificial prices in line with policy objectives set by the Brazilian government. The alignment with government directives has previously cost <mark>Petrobras</mark> billions per year. Even if the new pricing plan results in margin losses in the near term, a move towards market-driven pricing removes a lot of the risk associated with doing business in refining in Brazil both for <mark>Petrobras</mark> and for new entrants. In addition, it is anticipated that as pre-salt resources are further developed, the resulting high availability of feedstock will make Brazil even longer on crude and potentially improve local margins.</P><P><mark>Petrobras</mark>’ divestiture program could include refineries if there is interest, and it also includes its fuel distribution network, the largest one in Brazil. The company has also expressed interest in attracting capital from external stakeholders to finish the Comperj and <G class=""gr_ gr_301 gr-alert gr_spell gr_run_anim gr_inline_cards ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace"" id=""301"" data-gr-id=""301"">Rnest</G> refineries.</P><H2>Challenging investment and labor environment</H2><P>While investment opportunities have multiplied with policy changes and <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ divestiture program in both upstream and downstream, Brazil’s unstable political environment and regulations could make things more challenging as new players move in.</P><P>The current government was not elected by popular vote. Once the election cycle comes around, a potential new leadership could reverse the recent regulatory changes, introduce new rules or processes that may further complicate business, or the country may undergo a wave of reforms in response to the recent political upheaval, which could create an unstable investment environment. The risk is not immediate. It took the government almost 6 years to change the royalty structure even with <G class=""gr_ gr_314 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim gr_inline_cards Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep"" id=""314"" data-gr-id=""314"">voting</G> majority, and it usually takes about 2 years to introduce and approve regulations. Yet even a pause in the current effort to liberalize energy markets would be costly to future oil investment in Brazil.</P><P>Additionally, at a local level, Brazil’s regulations still tend to favor unions and obstruct profit-seeking operations—a significant setback for foreign operators. First, Brazil is an expensive location to hire foreign employees due to the fees and taxes paid to the government. While local labor is comparatively economic, any activity heating up like before 2012 could result again in capacity constraints of local personnel. On top of this, existing regulations make it complicated to hire both local and foreign workforce. Due to a system of laws that overwhelmingly protects the employee, Brazil is also home to a high number of labor claims—nearly 3 million in 2010 alone.</P><P>Lastly, the local content clause is still an active requirement for the upstream industry. Adherence to the law means operators are required to partly use local OFSE providers that will most likely not be the most cost-efficient, increasing the risk to profitability. And after the recent political scandals, many of the local suppliers and service providers formerly used by <mark>Petrobras</mark> have been blacklisted and are currently under investigation for corruption, or are already bankrupt. This lack of available cost-effective providers presents an added challenge for operators. Nevertheless, the government has announced it intends to relax minimum local content rules to assist pre-salt development so the impact of the clause is expected to be minimized.</P><H2>Does the reward outweigh the risks?</H2><H3>Upstream</H3><P>While entering Brazil independently—not as part of a joint venture with <mark>Petrobras</mark>—and adjusting to the country’s challenging rules and regulations may seem daunting, access to pre-salt resources is still a unique opportunity. The pre-salt resources have relatively low breakeven prices, long lives, and with the current budget crisis, both <mark>Petrobras</mark> and the Brazilian government are willing to share profits with external players.</P><P>It is EI’s expectation that pre-salt will end up being developed even under low prices, thanks to already sunk capital; the Lula field is already producing 700 kb/d with 2 more phases under way. In a USD 70/bbl Brent scenario, pre-salt would dominate offshore balances and help increase Brazil’s oil production by 60% by 2030; in the next 10 years, pre-salt production is expected to surpass 2 MMb/d, compared to 1 MMb/d in 2016.</P><H4>Exhibit 2: We project that this high risk, but high reward market will result in development of pre-salt, as the resource is too cheap not to be developed</H4><H6>EIA STEO, Energy Insights GLSM</H6><P>As local legacy production declines, we expect the state of Rio de Janeiro and the federal government to have an additional incentive to motivate operators to develop the pre-salt fields. Any kind of federal or regional incentives will further increase the expected profit margins for upstream operators. Overall, the government has proved it is actively seeking to help pre-salt development. For those reasons, we expect that A&amp;D activity will only increase going forward, turning Brazil’s upstream sector into an attractive, and active, investment arena.</P><P>Some companies have already decided the risk is worth it. Statoil acquired <G class=""gr_ gr_303 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim gr_inline_cards Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep"" id=""303"" data-gr-id=""303"">interest</G> in the Santos basin, including a significant part of the Carcará, for USD2.5 billion. Statoil estimates the recoverable volumes to be 700–1,300 MMboe and has already begun discussions with <mark>Petrobras</mark> regarding cooperation on future endeavors in the Campos and Espírito Santo basins. Shell has also announced that it plans to invest USD10 billion in the next five years, on top of the USD30 billion it has already invested in Brazil.</P><H3>Downstream</H3><P>The refinery industry is not as clear-cut of a potential investment target, as it is plagued more heavily by profitability uncertainty.</P><P>Even though the conditions are there to turn refining in Brazil into a profitable business in the near future, returns are more dependent on regulatory changes and the refining cycle, and thus the risk is still high. <G class=""gr_ gr_310 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim gr_inline_cards Punctuation replaceWithoutSep"" id=""310"" data-gr-id=""310"">We therefore</G> expect that the government and <mark>Petrobras</mark> will need to maintain a prolonged period of political stability and market-friendly <mark>climate</mark> before Brazil’s downstream can be considered a sought-after investment. For now, expectations are that distillation and conversion capacity will increase faster than demand, but still not fast enough to satisfy local product demand.</P><H4>Exhibit 3: Refinery Imbalance</H4><H6>Source: <mark>Petrobras</mark></H6><P>Nevertheless, we believe the regulators are moving in the right direction. Brazil downstream is a market that should be closely monitored in the upcoming years as a source of potential opportunities, especially as margins get squeezed in more mature markets.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""col""><DIV class=""wrapper quick-nav"" style=""color:#666666""><DIV class=""cta-newsletter""><H6>GET UPDATES</H6></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Key risks of interest to <mark>Petrobras</mark> include  those associated with: the production of oil and natural gas; the demand for  derivatives; the prices of various commodities; the start dates for various  operations; and changes in company capital (CAPEX) and operating (OPEX) expenditures. In performing analysis of these risks,  <mark>Petrobras</mark> looks to several key indicators: expected NPV; the standard deviation  of NPV to get a sense of the risk associated with the reward; the probability  of a negative NPV, or of losing money; and the 95% Value at Risk (VAR) of the  NPV, which is the minimum amount that <mark>Petrobras</mark> stands a 5% chance of losing. </P><P><SPAN class=""headersubsub""><mark>Petrobras</mark>’s Progride System</SPAN></P><P>To evaluate these risks, the Exploration and Production (E  &amp; P) section of <mark>Petrobras</mark> developed an in-house system for corporate-wide  use called Progride.  Progride is based  in Excel and uses customized C++ subroutines to perform it analyses.  The company uses it to model a variety of E  &amp; P applications, including: oil trends like prices and spreads; income  taxes and royalties; depreciation, residual value, and economic life of a project;  sensitivity analysis; and other internal economic indicators.  Progride also has risk analysis capabilities.</P><P>The system is capable of handling complexities such as  multiple dependent projects (i.e. a base project plus complementary projects) within  the same geographic site or “concession.”   A concession represents the right for <mark>Petrobras</mark> to drill in a specific  area, and typically carries with it obligations of rent, tax, and royalty  payments. Proglide can also manage anticipated future production projects as  well as projects that reduce operating expenses (i.e. have “negative” future  operating expense).</P><P><SPAN class=""headersubsub"">Conventional Progride Analysis</SPAN></P><P>E &amp; P analysts at <mark>Petrobras</mark> enter a variety of data to  run a conventional Progride analysis, making assumptions for what is uncertain.  These data include: discount, inflation, tax  and exchange rates; operation start dates; depreciation time; oil prices;  production curves at the site for oil, natural gas, and water as well as water  injection; capital expenditures such as drilling, surface installations, and  collection; fixed and variable operating costs; and the cost of abandonment. </P><P>From such an analysis, Progride returns the NPV, IRR, and  project return time; the best date for project abandonment; and the financial  exposure to the company.  However these  results are based on best-guess point values in the input data that are assumed  to be 100% certain.  Thus risk is not  taken into account. </P><P><SPAN class=""headersubsub"">Risk Analysis in Progride</SPAN></P><P>For a risk analysis in Progride, analysts must construct  distributions to represent ranges of possibilities for key input  variables.  These include: probabilistic production  curves at the site for oil, natural gas, and water as well as water injection; unit  production operational capacity; distributions for deviations in each CAPEX and  OPEX component; and a distribution for the operation’s start date.</P><P>From this risk analysis, Progride provides the expected NPV  of the project along with a histogram and measures of dispersion, or risk,  around the expected NPV.  It also  estimates the probability of a negative NPV, or of losing money on the project.</P><P><SPAN class=""headersubsub"">Limitations of Progride</SPAN></P><P>As useful as Progride is to <mark>Petrobras</mark>, it has a number of significant limitations that led the company to look to <A href=""../risk/""><SPAN class=""arroworange"">@RISK</SPAN></A>.  For one, Progride’s risk analysis does not  provide user access to the simulation data, preventing analysts from getting a  closer look at different probabilistic scenarios.  Furthermore, Progride cannot effectively handle  more complex projects, such as those done in partnership with other companies,  projects that share common infrastructure, or integrated projects with multiple  concessions. </P><DIV style=""margin: 0 -90px 10px 30px;

The results of these two conventional concession analyses form the  probabilistic scenario for each (e.g. production, revenue, CAPEX, OPEX, fiscal  costs, and depreciation).  See Figures 2 and 3.</P><P>These individual concession results are then summed together  to determine the probabilistic scenarios for the integrated project as a whole  (A+B).  Next, a conventional Progride  analysis is performed on the integrated project in @RISK using the combined  probabilistic scenarios as entry data.  Desired  risk indicators for the entire project are then calculated from the analysis  results.  See Figure 4.</P><P class=""headersubsub"">Easy as 3-2-1</P><P>The @RISK-Progride process can be summed up in 3 stages, 2  functions, and 1 macro. </P><P>The 3 stages of the process are:</P><OL><LI>Use @RISK to model and generate probabilistic  scenarios for the shared and independent risk factors.</LI><LI>Link the probabilistic scenarios generated in  @RISK to the input data of each concession’s conventional Progride analysis  using the Excel’s Offset and @RISK’s RiskCurrentIter functions.</LI><LI>Execute each Prograde conventional analysis  individually in @RISK, calling the macro which executes the Progride  conventional analysis after each @RISK iteration.</LI></OL><P>The two primary functions used to accomplish the integration  between @RISK and Progride are:</P><OL><LI>RiskCurrentIter(): This is an @RISK Statistics function  which returns the value of the current iteration of the simulation while  running.</LI><LI>Offset(cell ref, rows, columns): This is an Excel  function which returns the value of a cell located a specified number of rows  and columns from a particular cell reference.</LI></OL><P>Finally, there is only one macro needed in the process.  @RISK is set to run this Excel macro after  each iteration recalculation during a simulation.  The macro simply runs Progride and contains  the code: <EM>SendKeys &quot;%PX&quot;, True</EM></P><P><SPAN class=""headersubsub"">Benefits of the @RISK-Progride Solution</SPAN></P><P><mark>Petrobras</mark>’s integrated solution gives the company a number  of valuable benefits.  First, it permits  the separation of probabilistic scenarios for shared risk factors common to the  projects being analyzed.  Second, the use  of @RISK allows the analysis of projects undertaken with partners.  Similar to the above example, a separate  Progride analysis is done for each partner, treating the fiscal aspects  individually, but sharing the project risk factors.  Third, as we’ve just seen, this approach  enables the analysis of integrated projects with multiple concessions, with a  separate Progride analysis for each concession that treats the fiscal and  depreciation aspects individually while sharing project risk factors.  Similarly, projects that share infrastructure  with other, separate projects or concessions can now also be modeled in the  same manner. Lastly, @RISK helps <mark>Petrobras</mark> reduce the calculation time for  projections that used to take thousands of hours to a single day. If you multiply the saved hours by staff pay  rates, you can get a pretty good picture of some huge cost savings.</P></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Photo courtesy of Jason Dyett.</H6><P class=""p1"">With Brazil’s state oil company <mark>Petrobras</mark> engulfed in a massive corruption scandal, the government looks poised to introduce an energy sector overhaul that would reverse a trend of using state-run companies to drive economic development. While most of the details of the scheme have only recently come to light—creating a political crisis for the president just as the economy is faltering—the corruption scandal follows years of political interference in the management of <mark>Petrobras</mark> and in energy policy more broadly.</P><P class=""p2"">The bribery scandal first came to light in March 2014, when a senior executive, Paulo Roberto Costa, was arrested on charges of money-laundering. In a plea bargain, he revealed a vast kickback scheme that involved inflating <mark>Petrobras</mark> contracts and pocketing 3% of the value. Many of the company’s top executives and senior government officials, including some from the ruling Workers Party, have been implicated. </P><P class=""p2"">The scandal has reached the highest levels at the company. Jose Sergio Gabrielli, <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ chief executive from 2005 to 2012, had his assets frozen by a court order in January. Although Gabrielli’s successor appears to have had no involvement in or prior knowledge of the scheme, the appointee Maria das Graças Silva Foster—a close friend of President Rouseff—resigned under pressure on February 4, along with five other <mark>Petrobras</mark> executives. Several top executives have since received fines and prison terms.</P><P class=""p2"">The scandal’s financial repercussions are particularly painful for the world’s most indebted company, with some of the largest annual corporate investment plans globally.  For several months, <mark>Petrobras</mark> was unable to calculate its losses from the bribery scheme, preventing its auditor Price Waterhouse Cooper from approving its financial statements, originally due in November. In late April, <mark>Petrobras</mark> finally released its audited financials, dodging a technical default that could have blocked it from international capital markets. The company reported a $16.8 billion write down, or reduction in the value of its assets, including more than $2 billion from corruption. Not surprisingly, <mark>Petrobras</mark> stock has taken a hit, falling from $72 per share at its height in 2008 to around $5 per share in March, recovering slightly after its financial statements were released.</P><P class=""p2"">In a significant reversal of past policies, <mark>Petrobras</mark> is now taking steps to improve its balance sheet and restore investor confidence. It announced it will not issue any new foreign debt this year, and its latest 2015-2019 business plan, published in June, includes an aggressive 37% reduction in capital spending compared to the previous plan. <mark>Petrobras</mark> also plans to divest some $15.1 billion worth of assets. The decline in global oil prices unexpectedly has a silver lining for <mark>Petrobras</mark>. While Brazil’s government-controlled fuel prices generated losses for <mark>Petrobras</mark> in past years when international oil prices were high, retail prices in Brazil are now above international import prices, yielding a profit for the company. </P><P class=""p2"">Belt-tightening at <mark>Petrobras</mark>, while necessary under the current circumstances, could hurt the company in the long run. Its oil production has been flat over the past five years despite the discovery of some of the largest oil reserves in the world off Brazil’s shores, known as the “pre-salt.” It has repeatedly missed production targets over the years and in June announced a steep reduction in its 2020 oil output target from 4.2 million to 2.8 million barrels per day. The company has banned 23 of Brazil’s largest engineering and construction firms from future oil and gas exploration auctions because they were allegedly involved in the scandal, leaving few qualified suppliers in a country with particularly strict local content rules. For now, its divestment plan is targeting less important assets in refining and distribution, international holdings and marginal oil fields, but if the company’s weak cash position forces it to sell larger core assets in the future, its long-term growth will be compromised.</P><H4 class=""p3"">TROUBLES AT <mark>PETROBRAS</mark></H4><P class=""p2"">While the corruption scandal has revealed a new depth to the troubles at <mark>Petrobras</mark>, it comes on top of years of problems tied to political interference in strategic decision-making. Following <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ discovery in 2007 of the pre-salt reserves, then-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, also of the Workers Party, presented a bill to Congress that increased government control over <mark>Petrobras</mark>. The state oil company remained partially privatized, a legacy of reforms under his more market-oriented predecessor in the late 1990s, but the government increased its stake in the company and made <mark>Petrobras</mark> the exclusive operator with a minimum 30% stake in all pre-salt fields. </P><P class=""p2"">The new regulations put a tremendous financial and operational burden on <mark>Petrobras</mark> and restricted international oil companies’ participation in exploration and production in Brazil. Other politically motivated decisions, such as the fuel price caps, strict requirements for using Brazilian equipment and services, and the building of expensive refineries in the poor, less populated Northeast for economic development purposes, further undermined <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ finances and ability to manage its complex projects.</P><P class=""p2"">Similarly, in the power sector, un<mark>sustainable</mark> price controls were implemented in the name of economic development. In 2012, the government forced power generation plants to cut their prices in order to aid large industrial electricity consumers, weakening the finances of power companies. Last year, Brazil faced a major drought that reduced supplies of cheap hydroelectric power, forcing utilities to use more expensive natural gas. However, the government did not allow companies to raise their rates but loaned them money instead. Now, to shore up its finances, the government will have to cut subsidies and raise rates. </P><P class=""p2"">At <mark>Petrobras</mark>, politically driven decisions had frustrated the rank and file long before the corruption scandal was made public. One <mark>Petrobras</mark> project manager told me last year that Lula had “destroyed the company” and that most of his colleagues were unhappy with the top management. While they respected Foster, an engineer and industry veteran, they had been skeptical of her predecessor Gabrielli, a political appointee and co-founder of the Workers Party with little experience in the oil industry. </P><P class=""p2"">Many of the company’s employees may also have known about the corruption for years although they were not involved. When I was a journalist covering Brazil’s oil industry, a senior <mark>Petrobras</mark> manager told me in 2013—before the scandal was revealed—that inflated contracts were behind the ballooning budget for <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ Abreu e Lima refinery in northeastern Brazil. The refinery project ultimately cost $18 billion compared to an initial estimate of $2.5 billion. Costa has since admitted to inflating the contracts for Abreu e Lima as part of the kickback scheme.</P><P class=""p2"">It is unclear whether <mark>Petrobras</mark> will gain more independence from the government in strategic decision-making under its new CEO. <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ new leader, Aldemir Bendine, who was head of Banco do Brasil, the largest public bank in the country, has close personal ties to the president.  The fact that he is an outsider to the oil industry and thus safe from any allegation of involvement in the bribery scheme is certainly reassuring. But it remains unclear whether he and his new team will have sufficient freedom to manage the company.</P><H6><mark>Petrobras</mark> headquarters: if the company's weak cash position forces it to sell larger core assets in the future, its long-term growth will be compromised. Photo courtesy of Jason Dyett.</H6><H4 class=""p2"">ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FALLOUT</H4><P class=""p2"">The state-led approach undertaken by both the Lula and Rousseff administrations is not confined to the energy sector. Over the last decade, Brazil’s economy has been weighed down by increasing public spending, rising debt and protectionist trade policies, while needed investments in its failing infrastructure and weak educational system have not materialized.</P><P class=""p2"">Now, these policies have become un<mark>sustainable</mark> as the global economic environment has turned hostile for Brazil. Economic growth in China, Brazil’s largest trading partner, has slowed, and prices for Brazilian oil, minerals and agricultural products have declined. Monetary tightening in the United States is expected to restrict the flow of dollars to emerging markets. Brazil’s economy grew only 0.1% in 2014 and is expected to contract this year. Its new finance minister, Joaquim Levy, is charged with imposing unpopular austerity measures to balance the budget and safeguard Brazil’s investment grade status, such as cutting public spending, reducing pension and unemployment benefits and raising taxes. The reduction in spending by Brazil’s largest company will only further undermine economic growth. However, the corruption scandal’s effects on the construction industry could be even more far-reaching for the economy. Many major Brazilian construction firms that were expected to execute the country’s ambitious infrastructure plans have been shut out of capital markets because of alleged corruption, or face potential bankruptcy as a result of reduced demand from the oil industry. </P><P class=""p2"">Public anger over the scandal has severely weakened the administration of President Dilma Rousseff, who kicked off her second term in January.  Although the president herself was apparently not aware of the scheme, it coincided with her tenure as president of <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ board of directors. Already some opposition figures are calling for her impeachment and her approval ratings have dropped to around 10%.  Hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets across Brazil in various demonstrations over the last few months to voice their anger at the president. </P><P class=""p2"">But the political fallout from the scandal could drag on. As more people are brought up for charges of corruption and offered plea bargains in exchange for information, the list of alleged offenders will likely grow. What’s worse, another corruption scheme that may be even larger in scale is emerging. In March, police and finance ministry officials revealed that over the past decade the government had been robbed of between $1.8 billion and $6 billion in back taxes and fines from various firms.</P><P class=""p3"">REFORMS AHEAD?</P><P class=""p2"">As these problems come to a head, Brazil is moving toward implementing reforms to root out corruption, stabilize the economy and revise its energy policies. The president has given investigators unprecedented freedom to prosecute criminals on corruption charges, proposed anti-corruption legislation to Congress and reshuffled her cabinet to realign her political ties and distance herself from alleged offenders. </P><P class=""p2"">In the oil and gas sector, an opposition congressman has already introduced a bill to reverse <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ obligations as sole operator with a minimum 30% in the pre-salt. Local content requirements, which the government has already loosened, will likely be further retracted. In both the hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s and electricity sectors, the government says it will raise prices in order to cut subsidies, and some government officials are calling for allowing <mark>Petrobras</mark> to set its own pricing policy. </P><P class=""p2"">Amid all the turbulence, the future may still be bright for Brazil’s energy giant. <mark>Petrobras</mark> maintains access to gigantic reserves and will eventually reach its production targets, even if not as quickly as originally planned. The company remains a leader in deepwater drilling capabilities, meaning it has the technological ability to develop these complex projects. There have been delays in starting production from new offshore fields, but tremendous progress has been made on the operational side since the first major pre-salt discovery was made eight years ago. Pre-salt production has now surpassed 800,000 barrels per day, and <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ total oil production in Brazil rose 5% to just over 2 million barrels per day in 2014. </P><P class=""p2"">However, beyond the drilling successes and the pending legislative reforms, the most important outcome of the scandal will hopefully be a new culture of corporate governance and transparency that has clearly been lacking at <mark>Petrobras</mark>. </P><P><EM><STRONG>Lisa Viscidi</STRONG> is director of the Energy, <mark>Climate Change</mark> and Extractive Industries Program at the Inter-American Dialogue.

      today signed a memorandum of understanding regarding a strategic 
      alliance to jointly identify and evaluate potential business 
      opportunities.
    </P><P>
      The memorandum of understanding was signed in Rio de Janeiro today by 
      Pedro Parente, president of <mark>Petrobras</mark>, Brad Corson, president of 
      ExxonMobil Upstream Ventures, and Stephen Greenlee, president of 
      ExxonMobil Exploration Company.
    </P><P>
      <mark>Petrobras</mark> and ExxonMobil will evaluate areas of mutual interest that can 
      bring together their world-class experience across all sectors of the 
      oil and gas production value chain, including opportunities for 
      cooperation in exploration, production, gas and chemicals both inside 
      and outside Brazil.
    </P><P>
      For <mark>Petrobras</mark>, the formation of alliances is an important strategy in 
      the Business and Management Plan 2017-2021, bringing significant 
      potential benefits, such as risk sharing, augmented investment capacity 
      in the oil and gas chain, technology sharing and strengthening of 
      corporate governance.
    </P><P>
      This agreement both exemplifies and reinforces ExxonMobil’s strategic 
      relationship with <mark>Petrobras</mark> and continuing emphasis on growing this 
      relationship and its business in Brazil, building on its more than 100 
      years in the country.
    </P><P>
      In September, <mark>Petrobras</mark> and ExxonMobil jointly acquired six offshore

But a number of Western companies have also made considerable </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y53 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">investments in their home country, notably Exxon spent US$ 79million on local communities in</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y76 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">the United States in 2006 <SPAN class=""ff3"">(57% of the company’s social investment budget for that year).</SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y78 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">Table 2 provides an overview of community investments by 20 companies to ascertain to what </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y79 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">extent oil companies fund communitydevelopment schemes and whatspecific focus areas they </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y86 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">target. All 20 companies support education initiatives and 18 out of 20 companies support health </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y87 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">initiatives  aimed  at local  communities (in  addition to  education  or health  initiatives  for  their</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y88 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">workers). However, there is a wide variation in the scope of initiatives and the level of integration. </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y89 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">The initiatives range from occasional financial donations to schools/hospitals to the construction of </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y8a ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">new schools and otherfacilities. Some initiatives appear to have little integration with the </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h4 y8b ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">company’s activities and exhibit few signs of a “social strategy” (e.g. a single donation to a medical </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h4 y8c ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">facility), other initiatives exhibit a high level of integration with the company’s operations (e.g. </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y8d ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">skills training that may help local people to find employment in the oil and gassector). Among </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h4 y8e ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">emerging market companies, South Africa’s Sasol and Brazil’s <mark>Petrobras</mark> appear to have much more </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h4 yc0 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">sophisticated and integrated development programs than, for instance, China’s Sinopec or </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yc1 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">Hungary’s MOL.</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yc3 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">However, while there is a wealth of community investments, the current reporting on these </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yc4 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">activities is very weak. <SPAN class=""ff3"">The companies’ social and environmental reports contain only inputand no </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yc5 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">output measures for their social investment. In other words, companies provide information on how </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yc6 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">much they have spent on education or philanthropic activities or how many local stakeholders </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 ycd ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">participated in a project, but they provide no measures of how effectively the money was spent. Not </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yce ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">even the level of spending is comparable between companies because it is not clear what is included </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 ycf ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">and what is not included (e.g. Exxon’s figure includes Public Relations<SPAN class=""ff2"">-related donations to arts </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yd0 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">institutions and spending on public policy research).

Yet the author’s findings suggest that, <SPAN class=""ff2"">for all the money that oil </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y77 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">companies have spent on development initiatives, there are surprisingly few tangible benefits for </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y78 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">local stakeholders. </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h4 y86 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">The positive impact of social investments is severely constrained by the companies’ own motives</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y87 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">for community development work. Firms may embark on social investments in order to follow </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y88 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">public relations  priorities, in  order to  enhance  employee motivation  or  in order to  maintain a </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h4 y89 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">“licence to operate” (i.e. maintaining a stable working environment). These corporate priorities </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y8a ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">often constrain development efforts. They may explain the earlier observation that corporate reports </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y8b ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">do not provide any indicators of how effectively the communitydevelopment funds are spent, and </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y8c ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">that projects are often driven by short-term expediencies rather than the long-term development</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y8d ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">needs of a community.  </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yc0 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">In contrast to best development practice advocated by the World Bank and other development </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yc1 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">institutions,  CSR initiatives  have  often been  conceived  by the  ‘helpers’  in the  air<SPAN class=""ff2"">-conditioned</SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yc2 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">offices  of  oil  companies  and  consultancies  rather  than  through  ongoing  participation  with  the </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yc3 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">beneficiaries, which follows the logic of CSR serving corporate priorities. Where oil companies </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yc4 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">have consulted local communities, the consultation  exercises have often been superficial and</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yc5 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">grossly inadequate. The involvement of the beneficiaries of CSR in implementingprojects tends to </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yc6 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">be limited or non-existent and it may be limited at best to awarding contracts to locally based </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 ycd ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">companies. While the involvement of locally based companies can be beneficial as it creates local </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yce ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">employment, the author’s<SPAN class=""ff2""> experiences from Africa are that these companies are often linked to local </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 ycf ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">strongmen and the award of contracts simply serves to maintain a stable working environment.</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yd1 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">Above all, CSR initiatives are inherently flawed due to social attitudes of oil companystaff, that </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yd2 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">means, social values that guide decisions made by company staff. The people in chargewithin oil </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yd3 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">companies  (i.e.  the  company  directors,  asset  managers  etc.)  usually  have  a  managerial  and/or </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""pdf-viewer-page""><DIV id=""pfd"" class=""pf w0 h0"" data-page-no=""d""><DIV class=""pc pcd w0 h0""><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y4c ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">engineering background. They are highlycapable of dealing with technical and managerial </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">challenges, which is reflected in their approaches to CSR. As Michael Blowfield argued, “The </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y4e ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">technologies used in CSR reflect a preference for measurement, quantitative data-processing and </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y4f ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">particular means of communicat<SPAN class=""ff3"">ion (…) segmenting information into quantifiable components to </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">aid the process of management”.</DIV><DIV class=""c x7 y26 w1 h0""><DIV class=""t m0 x2 h6 yd5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls3 ws0"">31</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x3d h2 yd6 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">This preference can help to explain both the success of many</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yd7 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">environmental improvements and the failure of many social investments. When the corporate will is </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 yd8 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">present and the CSR challenge can be reduced to distinct quantifiable technical and managerial </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h4 y55 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">tasks, oilcompanies can perform CSR tasks to a high standard. As discussed earlier, BP’s target to </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y56 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">reduce <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions led by the company’s CEO John <SPAN class=""ff2"">Browne was very successful. A </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h4 y57 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">technical/managerial  challenge  such  as  <mark>carbon</mark>  dioxide  emissions  can  be  reduced  to  ‘metrics’, </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h4 y58 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">‘indicators’ or ‘guidelines’ and job performance can be quantified. Therefore, technical/managerial </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y5a ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">approaches can successfully address environmental issues, but theyare often insufficient in </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y5b ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">addressing complex social problems where soft skills, patience and inter-personal skills are much </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y5c ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">more important.  </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y5e ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">The limitations of technical/managerial approaches  can be  seen in  the manner,  in  which local </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y5f ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">communities are consulted. A consultation exercise is inherentlyqualitative and inherently </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y60 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">discursive requiring in-depth discussions and thebuilding of a good rapport with people. Treating </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y61 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">consultation from a technical/managerial perspectiveleads managers to speed up discussions with </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y62 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">local communities and to try to achieve an immediate goal (such as a written list of local demands) </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y63 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">rather than trying to build bridges with the local people and spending lengthy periods discussing the </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y65 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">causes of <SPAN class=""ff3"">problems. In the wordsof one development professional in Nigeria: ‘Shell learned fast </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y67 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">new approaches and paid lip servicebut corrupted the practice, for example, PRAs [participatory </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y68 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">rural appraisals] done in two days like an engineering exercise’.

In the words of one recent study on Azerbaija<SPAN class=""ff3"">n, ‘The main weakness of </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h4 y106 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">EITI is the lack of reporting and monitoring of the government’s spending of oilrevenues’.</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x4b h6 y123 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls3 ws0"">40</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y107 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">Indeed, the premise of  the EITI that  revenue transparency provides  benefits for  implementing </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y108 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">countries and investorsis unproven and speculative, given that existing research focuses on </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y109 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">government  spending  <SPAN class=""ff3"">–</SPAN>  not  revenue  transparency.  Studies on  transparency  that  found positive </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y10a ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">benefits of transparency focused on the transparency of spending and actual outcomes of spending. </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y10b ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">Previous  research measured the  transparency  of individual countries according  to quantitative </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y10c ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">indicators such  as macro-economic  forecasts</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x4d h6 y124 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls3 ws0"">41</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x4e h2 y10c ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">, the  publication of  International Monetary  Fund </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y10d ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">reports on the macro-economic performance of countries</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x4f h6 y125 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls3 ws0"">42</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x50 h2 y10d ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">and the quality of government budget </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y10e ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">documentation</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x3b h2 y10e ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">.

First, <SPAN class=""ff3"">the “business case for CSR” </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y61 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">(that is, the use of social initiatives for attaining corporate objectives) sets limits on what such </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y62 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">initiatives can achieve for broader society. While the business case has potential for successfully </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y63 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">addressing environmental issues, making a business case for tackling poverty or governance failures </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y65 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">is often much more difficult. Unlike development agencies, companies do not tend to prioritise </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y67 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">overall development goals such as poverty reduction. Indeed, profit-maximising motives are often </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y68 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">incompatible with good development practice </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y6c ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">Second, multinational companies often fail to acknowledge the full extent of their interactions with </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y6d ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">society and politics and they do not accept responsibility for macro-level issues <SPAN class=""ff3"">–</SPAN> issues concerning </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y6e ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">the society-wide impact of their industry. While companies clearly exercise political influence, they </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y6f ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">tend to reject the notion that theycould play a constructive role in helping to address governance </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y70 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">failures.

Yet CSR initiatives will not be able to tackle </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y72 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">some of the key social and environmental challenges in the oil and gas sector without addressing </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y73 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">governance. </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""pdf-viewer-page""><DIV id=""pf12"" class=""pf w0 h0"" data-page-no=""12""><DIV class=""pc pc12 w0 h0""><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y4c ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">The limitations of CSR do not implythat oil companies should do nothingabout societal issues. </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y4d ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">Firms are pressured to engage with the social and environmental aspects of their operations and </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x1 h2 y4e ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">they may benefit from the opportunities that CSR offers.

Trends in Building Constructive Relationships
</H3><P>
The world is changing in many dramatic ways, and so is the oil and natural gas industry. With a rising world population, economic development – including the availability of clean, affordable energy – is needed to support the global desire for a better quality of life. At the same time, the burden on the environment is increasing to the extent that in various parts of the world, natural resources that always have been renewable – fresh water, clean air, soil, forests and fisheries – are losing their ability to regenerate and sustain growing local populations. Tensions arising from economic development and environmental conservation are major contributors to social pressures and conflicts. The explosion of global electronic communication heightens public awareness of these problems, calling for greater transparency and accountability of governments as well as business.
</P><P>
In response to these pressures, the oil and natural gas industry is placing greater emphasis on understanding the varied needs and expectations of the countries and communities in which it operates. This not only translates to conducting oil &amp; gas activities in an economically, socially and environmentally responsive manner, but includes working together with stakeholder groups and affected parties to identify constructive solutions to shared problems.
</P><P>
Several emerging trends are influencing the nature of public-private partnerships.
</P><H3>
Globalization
</H3><P>
The world is becoming increasingly interconnected - economically, socially and environmentally – through technological developments. The availability of affordable, clean energy has been a fundamental driver of progress in the developed world and is becoming even more essential in helping developing countries achieve their economic, social and environmental aspirations. As the industry explores and operates in locations where extreme poverty and harsh working conditions exist, API member companies with global operations are working diligently in developing countries to create cooperative partnerships to better understand and address their unmet needs and goals.
</P><H3>
License to Operate
</H3><P>
The industry recognizes that it derives its license to operate from the public, and that companies and the industry need to work harder and more creatively to preserve that right to operate. Companies are demonstrating that they can be more than “good
neighbors” by actively working with community and other partners to protect the environment, support educational development and develop local capacity. These actions in turn help create a more stable and desirable environment in which communities
may prosper and businesses may operate in a <mark>sustainable</mark> manner.
</P><H3>
Social Investment
</H3><P>
While most companies continue to provide funds and promote sponsorships through well-established philanthropic programs, companies are also becoming more engaged as active partners in addressing community needs and making true social investments. This
represents an expanding dialogue and a deepening of involvement with stakeholders to ensure programs and activities are meaningful investments that can be tailored to the needs of the community and have <mark>sustainable</mark>, long-lasting benefits.
</P><H3>
Transparency
</H3><P>
As the world becomes more globally interconnected, there is a rising expectation that business will become more accessible and transparent about its operational values, policies, practices and performance. In response, the industry is taking action to improve the quality, quantity and consistency in reporting its performance and progress in the areas of environmental and social-economic stewardship. For example the API, IPIECA and OGP sponsored the development periodic updating of the <A href=""/~/media/Files/EHS/Environmental_Performance/voluntary-sustainability-reporting-guidance-2015.pdf"" title=""Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting"" class=""link-pdf"">Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting</A> to provide a convenient template for comparable reporting to ensure better understanding and communication
of the industry’s sustainability performance measurement and reporting practices.

It's also where the Olympic sailing competitions will be held. Athletes and residents are worried about possible health impacts.</P><DIV class=""group""><DIV class=""longText""><P>Alex Sandro dos Santos stands on the old wooden jetty that runs from the shore of the Tubiacanga settlement to the fishing boats. He has lived here, in Rio de Janeiro's north, for more than 40 years. And he's been fishing in Guanabara Bay since the age of 10.</P><P>&quot;There are still 20,000 fishermen here, and each of them has three or four children to take care of,&quot; dos Santos says. &quot;But it's no longer possible to live off fishing because of the decline in fish population.&quot;</P><P>The reason behind the shrinking fish numbers confronts anyone who dares to venture onto the dock. It stinks of sewage and rubbish. Plastic bottles, shoes, and even whole pieces of furniture float in the water. It's a fetid, filthy mass.</P><P>Across the bay, the panorama is dominated by the chimneys of oil refineries and the sprawling sea of houses making up Rio de Janeiro. Raw sewage from the metropolis flows right into the bay - at a rate of 18,000 liters per second, to be exact. &quot;Many fishermen work part time as waiters to earn some extra money,&quot; dos Santos says. He himself builds wooden crates to keep his finances afloat. </P><DIV class=""picBox	full

""><P>Fisherman Alex Sandro dos Santos laments the shrinking fish stocks in Guanabara Bay</P></DIV><P>The heavy industry nearby has also been dumping its highly toxic waste in the bay for decades. The sludge below, at a depth of 32 meters (105 feet), is contaminated with heavy metals, while the bay's water is polluted with multiresistant bacteria. A ruptured pipeline in January 2000 sent more than a million liters of oil flooding into the bay and the bioreserve of the adjacent mangrove swamp. Many residents from the area are still waiting for compensation from the state-run oil giant, <mark>Petrobras</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>Major health concerns for athletes</STRONG></P><P>Guanabara Bay serves as Rio de Janeiro's sewer, rubbish dump and waste oil storage site. Still, according to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), there's no reason why the sailing events in the upcoming Summer Games shouldn't be held here.</P><P>German sailor Erik Heil fell ill in 2015 after a test regatta in the bay. He suffered inflammation of the legs and hips, which only improved after he was given broad-spectrum antibiotics back in Berlin. Many athletes have voiced concerns about competing in the contaminated bay, vowing to take precautions to avoid skin contact with the water.</P><P>Another German sailor, Heiko Kröger, who won a gold medal at the Paralympics in 2000, has sharply criticized the IOC: &quot;I wouldn't be able to sleep if I were them,&quot; he said. Experts have also warned it's likely the bacteria in the bay could trigger worse diseases than the inflammation suffered by Heil. Marine biologist Mario Moscatelli, who has been monitoring and testing Rio's waterways, says the possibility of meningitis in the bacterial density, for example, cannot be ruled out.</P><P>&quot;Athletes should certainly be vaccinated against Hepatitis A before they compete in Rio,&quot; said the biologist, who for many years has spoken out about the appalling state of the bay.</P><DIV class=""picBox	full

Here there are all kinds of species, except whales,&quot; Ricardo says. At the same time, the sewage and 100-odd tons of rubbish that end up here each day are continuing to destroy life.</P><P>Ricardo takes a boat out across the bay to demonstrate the full extent of the damage - and to show that all efforts to clean up the bay thus far have failed. And yet it's these very measures the IOC points to in response to criticism over Rio's preparedness and the state of Guanabara.</P><DIV class=""picBox	full

""><P>Ecologist Sergio Ricardo says cleaning up the bay will take time</P></DIV><P>The federal state of Rio de Janeiro recently promised to clean up the bay for the Olympics, but little has improved. There have been several attempts to tackle the <mark>pollution</mark>. Between 1994 and 2006 the state invested more than 1 billion euros, with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank and the Japanese International Cooperation Agency, to construct sewage treatment plants.</P><P>Most of the connecting pipes were simply forgotten during construction, and they're still missing today. As a result, the bulk of the water continues to flow untreated into the bay. Meanwhile, the six built plants have been left to decay. &quot;The program hardly made an impact,&quot; says Ricardo. &quot;Instead, the government tried cosmetic measures - for example, getting boats to fish the rubbish out of the water.&quot;</P><DIV class=""picBox	full

More than 200 million euros were invested, but much of that money was gobbled up by corruption and bureaucracy. Another issue was the fact that, although households were connected to sewage systems, their waste didn't end up in a treatment plant. A number of institutions at local, regional and federal levels were involved in the project.</P><P>Experts like Sérgio Ricardo insist that cleaning up the bay is a long term project that will only begin to make a difference after around 20 years' of work. Attempts at a quick fix in time for the Olympics have achieved nothing, he says.</P><P>&quot;Canals and lagoons would need to be built,&quot; Ricardo says, adding that the disused rubbish dump near the bay must also be removed. &quot;Combined with the rubbish that comes from Rio, it's like the bay's molotov cocktail.&quot;</P><DIV class=""col2""><DIV class=""group""><DIV class=""imgTeaserM audio"" data-media-id=""19416398""><DIV class=""mediaItem"" data-media-id=""19416398""><DIV class=""teaserImg""><DIV class=""playButtonArea""><DIV class=""customPlayBtn""><SPAN class=""playBtnText"">Listen to audio </SPAN><SPAN class=""right"">04:07</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

	Auckland 31/5/12: A judge will hear legal arguments as part of a judicial review of the legality of a permit awarded to the oil company <mark>Petrobras</mark> to drill in deep water off the East Cape, in the Wellington High Court on June 5 and 6. 
</DIV></DIV><DIV><P>The application for the review was submitted on behalf of Te Whanau a Apanui and Greenpeace New Zealand.</P><P>The two parties are seeking that <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ permit be quashed, on the basis that the Government did not properly consider the environment (including the potential environmental damage that could be caused by the exploration <mark>Petrobras</mark> plans to carry out), New Zealand’s international obligations, or the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi, when it awarded the permit in 2010.</P><P>The permit is also being challenged on the basis that the Government did not adequately consult with Te Whanau a Apanui – whose rohe extends along the coastline of the East Cape – before it granted the permit.</P><P><mark>Petrobras</mark> carried out a seismic survey in the permit area in 2011.  This was the subject of protests by members of the Stop Deep Sea Oil Flotilla, of which Te Whanau a Apanui and Greenpeace were a part.</P><P>“The New Zealand Government’s permitting process around oil and gas drilling is among the weakest that I’ve ever seen,” says Rick Steiner, an independent consultant, and oil industry expert, based in Anchorage, Alaska</P><P>Steiner gave evidence in an affidavit that most well blowouts occur during the exploration phase, which is what <mark>Petrobras</mark> is currently engaged in. The Deepwater Horizon, which exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, was an exploratory well.</P><P>&quot;Astonishingly, on some matters, such as the carrying out of environmental impact assessments, New Zealand is even worse than Nigeria,&quot; Steiner says.</P><P>The Minister did not require an EIA to be carried out before oil drilling permits were granted.</P><P>“It seems that New Zealand’s Government has a dangerous laissez faire attitude to deep sea oil, that you would not see any longer in the United States or Europe. And that surprises me for a country that prides itself on its clean green reputation,&quot; Steiner says.</P><P>&quot;Even though drilling in the United  States is more tightly controlled than almost anywhere else, the Gulf of  Mexico Deepwater Horizon oil disaster was still able to occur,” says Steiner. </P><P>Te Whanau a Apanui’s Dayle Takitimu warns that the Rena oil disaster showed that deep sea drilling could easily create a disaster.</P><P>“The Rena showed that oil spills can’t be contained, if they occur in the open sea,” says Takitimu.</P><P>&quot;We have a sacred responsibility to protect and preserve our natural environment and the Government has a duty under the Treaty of Waitangi to work alongside us to achieve this. But because the Government is refusing to work with us over deep sea oil; it is putting our communities and the marine environment at risk,” she says.</P><P>After the Deepwater Horizon disaster, almost 230,000 square kilometres of ocean – an area twice the size of the North  Island – was closed to fishing. <mark>Petrobras</mark> intends to drill in waters up to twice as deep as those the Deepwater Horizon was operating in.</P><P>The Exclusive Economic Zone legislation currently before the New Zealand Parliament, is widely believed to have been intended to address the flaws that were pointed out to the Government after the <mark>Petrobras</mark> permit was awarded.</P><P>“As drafted, this legislation will not require the Government to protect the ocean, as international law requires, and its provisions on public consultation and participation are particularly weak. For instance, interested parties will not be able to challenge decisions in the Environment Court, but only challenge points of law, not facts, in the High Court,” says Vanessa Atkinson, Greenpeace New Zealand <mark>Climate</mark> Campaigner.</P><P>&quot;Greenpeace does not believe that deep sea oil exploration can ever be safe. If we are to prevent catastrophic, runaway <mark>climate change</mark>, the oil industry must not be allowed to open up its last, extreme frontiers, either in the Arctic, or in the deep waters off New Zealand,&quot; Atkinson says.</P><P>Ends</P><P>The hearing will take place at the High Court in Wellington (2 Molesworth St), at 10 am. It will be open to the media.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

But the deep Cretaceous salts which trap oil in rocks off Brazil's coast are “strong evidence”, in the words of President Dilma Rousseff, “that God is Brazilian.” It is not a new conceit, but it has rarely been a more apposite one. The <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal </EM>(“below the salt”) oilfields look set to generate wealth on a scale that could transform Brazil's economy.</P><P>Before the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM> finds, which started in 2007, the country's total proven and probable reserves were 20 billion barrels. Conservative estimates for the total recoverable <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal </EM>oil now come in at 50 billion barrels: a little less than everything in the North Sea, all in the waters of one country. Optimists expect three times as much. “In the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal </EM>area, our exploration has a success rate of 87%, compared with a world average of 20% to 25% for the industry,” says Sergio Gabrielli, the president of <mark>Petrobras</mark>, Brazil's state-controlled oil company.</P><ASIDE class=""main-content-container""><DIV class=""secondary-header grey-header size-compact"">Related items</DIV><UL class=""expanded-list white-palette typog-list-exp related-items""><LI><A href=""/node/21538175"">Correction: Brazil's oil</A><SPAN>Nov 12th 2011</SPAN></LI></UL></ASIDE><P>The first shipment of <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM> oil, 1m barrels from the Lula field (formerly known as Tupi), set sail for Chile in May. <mark>Petrobras</mark> is producing 100,000 barrels a day from the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM>, a third of it from the remarkably productive Lula test well (see map). By 2020 <mark>Petrobras</mark> expects to be pumping 4.9m barrels each day from Brazilian fields, 40% from the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM>, and exporting 1.5m: at the moment the country falls a little short of self-sufficiency. Today Brazil is the world's 11th-largest oil producer. By 2020 it should be in the top five.</P><P>Becoming an oil exporter could complete the development process that began with the conquering of hyperinflation in 1994. Because the country's previous period of economic development was brought to an end by the oil shocks of the 1970s, self-sufficiency in energy looks more than usually enticing to Brazilians. Plentiful hard currency looks good, too; it is just nine years since the country last had to borrow from the IMF to stabilise its currency. Petro-dollars will boost national saving—currently just 16% of GDP—creating room for Brazil to upgrade its decrepit infrastructure. And oil would add pleasingly to the geopolitical heft of a country keen to assert itself as a global power.</P><P>The possible missteps, though, are legion. Huge, technically challenging projects tend to run late and over budget everywhere. Last year's disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is a grim reminder of the risks in such “ultra-deep” drilling projects. And countries with big oil finds are prone to an ominous list of economic ailments: capital absorption (the diversion of funds from other worthwhile investments); Dutch disease (oil exports pushing the currency to a level that hurts other industries); and reform fatigue (governments' unwillingness to tackle structural economic problems when they can see vast wealth on the horizon).</P><P>Since the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal </EM>was discovered Brazil's politicians have talked much less about reforming burdensome tax and labour laws. The corrupting tendency of oil is worrying in a country where the president has had to sack five ministers since taking office in January over accusations of illicit enrichment. Without a lot of care, oil might block development as much as spur it on. In the 1970s, looking at what its oil reserves might mean for Venezuela's future in terms of waste, misallocated money and corruption, a former hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s minister, Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso, did not thank a providential god; the country's oil, he said, was but “the devil's excrement”.</P><P>A key to success in the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM> is <mark>Petrobras</mark>. The company's older offshore fields are deep enough that it already accounts for 22% of the world's deepwater production. The <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal </EM>should give it the know-how to become the world leader in “ultra-deep” drilling, too, opening new possibilities for it off Africa (where the geology is similar) and beyond.</P><P><STRONG>A moonshot under the ocean</STRONG></P><P>But it is an extraordinary technical challenge, and not just because of the depth, and thus the pressure, at which the drills must operate (see diagram). New seismic techniques are needed to see what's going on. The salt shifts during drilling. The oil comes out of its reservoirs very hot, and must then pass through wellheads that are only a few degrees above freezing. It is mixed with corrosive gases.</P><P>The dozens of floating production platforms required, which cost billions of dollars each, will be an uncommonly long way out to sea. Lengthy pipelines will have to be laid along the sea floor for the fields' gas (flaring it is illegal, as well as a waste). Oodles more platforms will be needed to act as way-stations for helicopters ferrying personnel out and back. The distances would also hamper the response to a disaster. Mr Gabrielli has warned that more needs to be done to prepare for such a Deepwater-Horizon-style catastrophe, not just by <mark>Petrobras</mark>, but by the government and armed forces, too.</P><P>Pedro Cordeiro of Bain &amp; Company, a consultancy, says all this makes developing the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM> a national commitment comparable to that of the Apollo programme. In terms of cost it is actually a good bit larger. Apollo cost less than $200 billion in today's dollars; the total bill was a few percent of America's annual GDP at the time. Ten years' aggressive development of the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM> could take a trillion dollars, around half of Brazil's 2010 GDP.</P><P>The lion's share of the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM> investment will come through <mark>Petrobras</mark>. Last year it raised $25 billion in cash with a share offer plus the rights to 5 billion barrels of <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal </EM>in an oil-for-shares swap with the government. It will be borrowing another $47 billion in the next few years, and plans to raise $14 billion more by selling assets. It is already engaged in nearly 700 projects costing more than $25m each, mostly to do with the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM>, and it has plans for $224 billion in capital expenditure from 2011 to 2015. This will account for a tenth of Brazil's gross fixed-capital formation over the next few years. <mark>Petrobras</mark> claims that exploiting the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM> will make it a bigger company than Exxon Mobil well within the decade.</P><P>For most of this year, though, the company's share price has been falling. There are two linked concerns: overstretch and political interference. The oil-for-shares swap means the government now owns more of <mark>Petrobras</mark> than it did before the share offering (48%, up from 40%). It has always held a majority of voting shares.</P><P>The government's role does not stop there. In the 1990s <mark>Petrobras</mark> was part-privatised and the system for allocating oil concessions was liberalised: concessions were to be sold at auctions in which any company, Brazilian or foreign, could bid equally. For the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM>, that model has been torn up. A new state enterprise, Pré-Sal Petróleo, will own all <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal </EM>deposits and can veto projects it deems not in the national interest. Future <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM> concessions will be auctioned to consortia which must include <mark>Petrobras</mark> as their operator, with a stake of at least 30%. Once a consortium has pumped enough to cover its costs, what remains must be shared with the state: winning bids will usually be those that hand over more of this “profit oil”.</P><P><STRONG>The oil is ours</STRONG></P><P>Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil's president at the time, justified these 2010 changes on the basis that “you offer risk-sharing contracts when there is risk. In the case of the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM>, we are sure.” This is a bit blithe. Mr Gabrielli has recently started emphasising the distinction between “exploration risk”, which seems low for the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM>, and “development risk”, which is high. And it is not obvious that a winning recipe needed more than tweaking. Brazil taxes oil relatively lightly. If the government felt it was underselling a close-to-sure thing it could have raised taxes on companies operating in the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM>. That would be a lot simpler than cost-plus calculations, which Norman Gall of the Fernand Braudel Institute, a São Paulo think-tank, expects to cause endless legal disputes. Adriano Pires, a Brazil-based energy consultant, says the changes to the regime have fed a perception of regulatory risk. He points to Lula's worrying resurrection of a slogan from state-monopoly days: “The oil is ours.”</P><P>Compared with lumbering state-run oil firms like Mexico's Pemex and Venezuela's PDVSA, treated as cash cows and employers of last resort, partially privatised <mark>Petrobras</mark> is fit and strong. Colombia's Ecopetrol is already following the <mark>Petrobras</mark> model, having placed some of its shares in the stockmarket, and Mexican politicians talk of similar steps. But navigating Brazil's mixed economy is never easy, for companies or their leaders. Earlier this year a posse of shareholders cobbled together by the government ousted Roger Agnelli, president of the privatised mining company Vale, who had laid off workers in the credit crunch against Lula's wishes and showed an excessive zeal for investment abroad.</P><P>So far Mr Gabrielli has handled such tensions rather niftily. But minority shareholders complain that the government is forcing the company to make uneconomic decisions. There are doubts as to whether it needs four new refineries when there is excess capacity abroad, and if so whether it makes sense to put two of them in the north-east, which pleases politicians but does not best serve markets. Then there is the purchase of supertankers from Brazilian yards with costs almost twice those of South Korea's. The government, concerned about inflation, regularly stops <mark>Petrobras</mark> from putting up petrol prices in line with rising world prices. Mr Pires calculates it has lost at least 9 billion reais ($4 billion) in the past eight years as a result.</P><P>Such tricks may end up weakening the firm's capacity to use its development expertise elsewhere. “By letting in competitors and letting <mark>Petrobras</mark> go abroad, [Brazil] created a real national champion,” says Sarah Ladislaw of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank. She thinks <mark>Petrobras</mark>'s recent decision to pull out of projects in Cuba, citing domestic commitments, may be evidence of overstretch. “Folks respect <mark>Petrobras</mark> and don't want to see it pull back internationally to be hamstrung at home.”</P><P>Perhaps the biggest challenge for <mark>Petrobras</mark> will come from the strict local-content requirements the government is imposing on <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal </EM>projects. The government intends to make these progressively more demanding, applying them to the entire supply chain. By 2017 they may reach as high as 95% for some parts of it. The oil-and-gas supply chain, broadly defined, accounts for 10% of Brazil's economy now. By 2020 its share should grow to 25%, say analysts.</P><P><STRONG>Jobs for the boys from Brazil</STRONG></P><P>The policy is meant to stop foreign suppliers from gouging <mark>Petrobras</mark> and its partners as they buy hardware by the $100 billion. It is also meant to stimulate domestic industry. “This is a very important demand pull on the Brazilian economy,” says Mr Gabrielli. “We think it will respond.” If it does, the benefits will be not only in quantity, but quality: a study by IPEA, a government-funded think-tank, found that <mark>Petrobras</mark>'s domestic suppliers were more technologically advanced and productive than the average Brazilian firm, and paid higher wages and more taxes.</P><P>New oil-and-gas service companies are already springing into being, providing everything from undersea electrical cabling to industrial quantities of popcorn (light, cheap and biodegradable, it can be thrown overboard to simulate the evolution of oil spills). A high-tech hub is forming around Cenpes, <mark>Petrobras</mark>'s research centre in Rio de Janeiro: leading service firms, including Baker Hughes, GE and Schlumberger, are building laboratories close by. The area will be the southern hemisphere's largest research complex, says <mark>Petrobras</mark>. In the state of São Paulo, the port city of Santos will be transformed into a managerial hub, with bases for fleets of helicopters and support ships.</P><P>Nevertheless, forcing <mark>Petrobras</mark> and its partners to buy Brazilian, and international companies to locate themselves there, will push up costs and cause delays. According to Booz &amp; Company, a consultancy, Brazilian suppliers to the oil and gas industry charge 10-40% more than world prices. Part of the problem is a scarcity of staff. Brazil's labour market is already so tight that employers complain about a “labour blackout”. <mark>Petrobras</mark> itself is unlikely to suffer: it gets hundreds of applicants for each job. But its suppliers will struggle.</P><P>According to a wide-ranging study of the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM>'s impact by Mr Gall, most workers starting courses at Prominp, a government-funded trainer for the oil and gas industry, needed remedial Portuguese and arithmetic lessons before they could read manuals or carry out simple calculations. Many dropped out and quite a few who finished their training were still of too low a standard to work in the industry. When Aker Solutions, a Norwegian oil-services company, explained weak results in August, it cited an overspend in Brazil caused by “too many inexperienced people”.</P><P>The attempt to stimulate supply-chain industries is in part a way to offset the Dutch-disease damage of high exchange rates. Some of the inconvenient strength of the currency is down to high real interest rates which attract footloose foreign capital. But soaring commodity exports are another factor (see chart). Brazil is the world's largest, or second-largest, exporter of iron ore, soyabeans, sugar, ethanol, coffee, poultry and beef. The commodity boom has led to a big improvement in Brazil's terms of trade—and hard times for Brazilian industry. Imports, mostly of manufactured goods, have grown even faster than exports, and the country's current-account balance is now negative. Though the economy grew by 7.5% in 2010, and is forecast to grow by more than 3% this year, industrial output, long flat, is starting to fall.</P><P>Local-content rules for the oil industry may help, but are of little comfort to, say, dressmakers, who are unlikely to become part of <mark>Petrobras</mark>'s supply chain. And they may have unintended consequences beyond reducing the oil industry's efficiency. Less spending outside Brazil by <mark>Petrobras</mark> and friends will reduce demand for foreign currency—thus pushing the real higher than it would be otherwise.</P><P>One way to counter Dutch disease is to raise productivity in the rest of the economy. Brazil is planning a fund to invest a good part of <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal </EM>revenues along these lines. Its aims, as yet ill-defined, include education, culture, science and technology, environmental sustainability and poverty eradication. Bain &amp; Company, asked by Brazil's national development bank to analyse the lessons of similar funds in Norway, Chile and elsewhere, said such spending could be worthwhile, provided clear targets were set and the money was professionally managed (not something the government's penchant for appointing placemen makes likely). It also recommended spending on the sort of infrastructure that would benefit other industries and help to lower the cost of exports, such as roads and ports. With 60% of all of Brazil's industrial investment currently in the oil and gas industry, according to the National Petroleum Industry Organisation, a trade body, that could be a welcome fillip.</P><P>But the sovereign fund may end up with little to invest in anything. A ferocious battle is being waged in Congress between the coastal states, which have in the past received most of the royalties from offshore oil, and the rest, which want a share. Until a solution is found, in the supreme court if need be, there can be no new <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM> auctions. The answer will probably involve the federal share shrinking, which will be bad for the fund and its chances of strategic investment. State revenues, whichever the state, will go straight into current spending.</P><P><STRONG>Still going Dutch</STRONG></P><DIV class=""content-image-float-290""><SPAN class=""caption"">Made in Brazil</SPAN></DIV><P>Tony Volpon of Nomura Securities, an investment bank, points to the disturbing possibility that Brazil could already be suffering from the Dutch disease associated with success in the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sa</EM><EM class=""Italic"">l</EM>—without yet enjoying any of the benefits. “Brazil's growing current-account deficit is similar to big investments in a company with present negative cashflows, but excellent earnings prospects,” he says. Most of the assets Brazilians hold abroad are low-yielding, such as treasury bonds; foreigners' assets in Brazil earn much more. For a commodity exporter like Brazil, those growth expectations can only be met by large current-account surpluses.</P><P>Running the numbers, Mr Volpon reckons that the current strength of the real implies Brazil's current account switching to surplus in a few years and its trade surplus increasing by 20% or so year on year. Only the <EM class=""Italic"">pré-sal</EM>, he thinks, can possibly justify such high expectations. If <mark>Petrobras</mark> disappoints by not producing oil quickly enough, it will find it difficult to go on attracting the foreign cash Brazil, and <mark>Petrobras</mark>, need. In consolation, though, the real would fall, providing a natural remedy for Dutch disease, and giving the rest of the economy time to breathe.</P><P>Mr Gabrielli, whose company plunges drill bits into the bowels of the Earth with a precision measured in centimetres, seems confident of steering a course that threads its way between the dangers of damaging haste and disappointing delay. For him, the providence invoked by Ms Rousseff lies not only in where the oil was found, but also when. “God hid it until Brazil was strong enough to cope,” he says with a laugh. It will soon become clear whether Mr Gabrielli is right.</P><P><STRONG>Correction</STRONG>: In our article on Brazil's new oilfields we stated incorrectly that the country now has a trade deficit. We meant to say that the current account is now in deficit. Brazil posted a trade surplus of $25.4 billion in the first ten months of the year. Apologies for the error.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

But if we drill deeper, it is clear that integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) analysis into investments – and engaging with companies – can deliver both a better financial return and a public good.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""main-text-module container-1440 ""><DIV class=""container-980""><DIV class=""text textRight""><P>Undoubtedly, oil poses more than a few headaches for ESG investors. Besides the obvious high <mark>carbon</mark> content of petroleum products, the industry as a whole has accrued a reputation as risky across a range of ESG measures. These include: environmental preservation, workers’ health and safety, executive pay and, as demonstrated by the <mark>Petrobras</mark> scandal, political corruption.</P><P>Yet in spite of – or perhaps because of – its blatant shortcomings, the oil industry attracts long-term investors who are prepared to engage on ESG matters. Despite rising sales of electric cars and the risk of fossil-fuel deposits becoming stranded assets, the oil industry is not disappearing any time soon. According to OPEC, global oil demand should increase until at least 2040. (see figure 1). That said, even if OPEC’s own growth expectations of 109m barrels of daily intake by 2040 prove to be overly optimistic, engagement on ESG factors – including <mark>climate change</mark> scenarios - will remain as important as ever.</P><P>For credit investors, oil companies are a significant presence, as they are the largest debt issuers in the global high-yield market, accounting for approximately 16% of notional debt. With so much at stake, it would be short-sighted to abandon the oil field to disengaged industry participants. And credit investors, like shareholders, need to discuss ESG concerns with oil firms if the industry is to improve. In turn, companies like <mark>Petrobras</mark> and Pemex, the Brazilian and Mexican state-owned oil majors, are heavily reliant on credit markets for financing and should be compelled to engage with bondholders.</P><P>Aware of the importance of ESG risk – to credit valuations returns and society – we assess them as part of our fundamental analysis of issuers<A href=""#footnote-1"" class=""scroll footnote""><SUP class=""footnote"">1</SUP></A>. In doing so, we draw on multiple sources of information, including Hermes’ proprietary ESG Dashboard reports on listed companies and the insights gained by the corporate engagement specialists in Hermes EOS.</P><P>When we identify a significant ESG risk within a company, we work with Hermes EOS to learn more – what actions are underway to improve the situation, and what are the implications for long-term returns? Two of our recent collaborations with Hermes EOS focused on Petrobas and Pemex, whose debt we invest in. These engagements, which we discuss in this issue of <EM>Spectrum</EM>, show that ESG factors can add demonstrable value at a time when investors are struggling to discern whether the oil barrel is half full or half empty.</P><P><STRONG>Shale puts old oil order under the pump</STRONG></P><P>Oil prices are typically volatile but the last three years have proven especially problematic for investors in the world’s most- traded commodity. From a high of $108 per barrel in June 2014, the benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price nosedived 50% to just $55 per barrel by December of that year. Following two years of dramatic volatility in oil markets, WTI had halved again by February 2016, bottoming out at $26 a barrel.</P><P>Investors belatedly attributed the unexpected collapse of the oil price to an historic shift in OPEC policy and the increasing efficiency of US shale production. Specifically, in November 2014 Saudi Arabia – the most influential OPEC member – broke with tradition by maintaining production levels in the face of falling oil prices. Its primary aim was to protect its market share from the burgeoning US shale sector.</P><P>OPEC, in collaboration with Russia, reinstituted production cuts late in 2016, which appears to have stabilised WTI prices within the range of $45-$55 per barrel. But given the standing threat of easily mobilised US shale production, oil prices are unlikely to test the $100-per-barrel mark in the short-to-medium term.</P><P>In spite of the production cuts, which have been extended to March 2018, oil has slipped towards the bottom of the forecast price range due to concerns about rising US production, with WTI trading below $47 per barrel at the time of writing.</P><P><STRONG>State-owned strength in a weak market</STRONG></P><P>Against that backdrop – and considering that most shale producers barely break even at current WTI prices – it should come as no surprise that the high-yield energy sector has underperformed the broader corporate high-yield index by about 1% in the year to early August (see graph below).</P><P>Given challenging fundamentals, we have been underweight the sector and this has benefited our year-to-date returns. Yet despite the weak outlook, we have identified robust instruments from oil companies that have also contributed positively to our performance.</P><P>As mentioned previously, both <mark>Petrobras</mark> and Pemex have attracted our attention for several reasons. <mark>Petrobras</mark> and Pemex – ranked 10th and 8th respectively in terms of global oil production – benefit from substantial scale, low costs of production and implicit government support.</P><P>Just as importantly, though, the two oil giants have boosted their performance and reputations by embarking on material strategic refurbishments. Following sustained engagements with investors, including Hermes, <mark>Petrobras</mark> and Pemex have made rapid improvements in their financial, operational, corporate governance, environmental and sustainability measures.</P><P><STRONG><mark>Petrobras</mark>: cleaning up after car wash</STRONG></P><P><mark>Petrobras</mark> ranks as Brazil’s number one corporate entity and among the largest integrated oil firms globally. The business is listed on the local and NYSE stock exchanges but remains majority-owned by the Brazilian government, which holds about 65% of the company.</P><P>Notably, <mark>Petrobras</mark> sources almost all of its oil offshore with about 80% derived from deep-water wells. The company began ramping up production from 2008 after making major oil discoveries in deep offshore fields located more than two kilometres below the geological salt layer, which formed at the time of the Gondwana landmass.</P><P>To exploit its discoveries, <mark>Petrobras</mark> more than quadrupled its borrowing levels over the next five years to a peak of about$140bn in 2014, compared to just $30bn previously. In the process, the company increased its leverage ratio from one-times to five-times.</P><P>While <mark>Petrobras</mark> has eased off the debt-pedal somewhat since 2014, its current borrowings of roughly $114bn mark it out as the largest constituent of the Global High Yield Index.</P><P>With leverage rising faster than production, mounting interest costs put extreme pressure on <mark>Petrobras</mark>’s cash flows by 2015, ahead of the $12bn in principal payments it was due to pay in 2016. Unfortunately, the <mark>Petrobras</mark> debt squeeze coincided with slumping oil prices and, to the further dismay of investors, a major corruption scandal flowing into the public domain.</P><P>An official investigation, launched in 2009, eventually uncovered a deep-seated bribery culture within <mark>Petrobras</mark>. According to the investigators, government-appointed senior executives at <mark>Petrobras</mark> had systematically squeezed about $1.9bn in bribes from suppliers and contractors, funnelling the proceeds back to politicians.</P><P>The corruption scandal, known as <EM>Lava Jato</EM> or Operation Car Wash, highlighted the Brazilian government’s conflicted role as both <mark>Petrobras</mark>’s controlling shareholder and the nation’s policy maker. For example, the Brazilian government had habitually used <mark>Petrobras</mark> to control internal inflation – directing the company to sell petrol to domestic consumers below international prices. The activity saw minority shareholders shouldering losses while putting strain on free cash flow available to pay bond- holders.</P><P>Unsurprisingly, the exposé revealed <mark>Petrobras</mark>’s lack of adequate corporate-governance mechanisms to manage these conflicting interests. However international investors have been pushing for better governance procedures within <mark>Petrobras</mark> for some time.</P><P>As far back as 2012, for instance, Hermes EOS has pressed for board changes at <mark>Petrobras</mark> that would see the independent directors take up the two seats reserved for minority shareholders that were not closely linked to the government. Historically, the Brazilian government had stacked the <mark>Petrobras</mark> board by appointing nine of the 11 seats and allowing minority shareholders – including state-controlled pension funds – to vote for the remaining two.</P><P>But in 2013, after a period of intense negotiations, Hermes EOS and a group of international investors were successful in seeing their two independent director nominees elected to the <mark>Petrobras</mark> board. By the 2015 AGM, at the height of the Car Wash scandal, the Brazilian government itself put forward independent board directors in lieu of the traditional state appointees.</P><P>Since then, <mark>Petrobras</mark> has begun to further bolster its corporate-governance framework, starting with the appointment of a chief compliance officer who, following international best practice, reported to the board rather than the chief executive. The pace of reform accelerated further in the second quarter of 2016 when new CEO, Pedro Parente, took the helm and imposed new rules that have heartened investors, including:</P><UL><LI><mark>Petrobras</mark> managers will be hired solely on merit;</LI><LI>Economic rationality will dictate commercial strategy; and, most importantly,</LI><LI>Petrol pricing will be managed independently and without state interference.</LI></UL><P>Satisfied with <mark>Petrobras</mark>’s board composition, Hermes EOS started focusing on the governance of its many subsidiaries – which facilitated much of the corruption revealed by Car Wash. There are up to 100 of these businesses, and none of them are listed and therefore required to report publicly. Hermes EOS has encouraged them to adopt the same best practices as <mark>Petrobras</mark>, such as its board nomination process.</P><P>The engagement with <mark>Petrobras</mark> has also expanded to cover its commitments to environmental sustainability. The company, which previously demurred on <mark>climate change</mark> discussions, has shown its interest in changing by inviting Hermes EOS to present its expectations of what oil companies should be doing in response to the rising global temperature.</P><P>In addition, <mark>Petrobras</mark>’s new corporate strategy, which was revealed in September 2016, emphasises debt reduction and focuses on targets that include:</P><UL><LI>Reducing leverage to 2.5-times by the end of 2018;• Selling $21bn of assets by the end of 2018;</LI><LI>Pursuing partnerships and joint ventures, which are projected to reduce capex burdens by 25% by 2021;</LI><LI>Increasing cash flows by improving efficiency and reducing headcount; and</LI><LI>Reducing accident rates.</LI></UL><P><mark>Petrobras</mark> still has some work to do but these initiatives have already struck paydirt, as demonstrated by the following achievements:</P><UL><LI>Leverage has declined from 5-times in the second quarter of 2016 to 3.15-times a year later;</LI><LI>Free cash flow has been generated for the last five consecutive quarters; and,</LI><LI>Moody’s upgrading <mark>Petrobras</mark> debt from B3 up to B1 with positive outlook.</LI></UL><P>Strategic turnaround combined with substantially strengthened corporate governance resulted in <mark>Petrobras</mark> spreads rallying despite the overall weakness in the energy sector weakness (see figure 4).</P><P><STRONG>Pemex: seeking sustainability</STRONG></P><P>North of the Brazil border, Mexico’s Pemex – or Petróleos Mexicanos – has experienced some of the same problems as <mark>Petrobras</mark>, namely: high debt levels and government interference in its commercial operations. Unlike <mark>Petrobras</mark>, it is wholly owned by the government.</P><P>Today the firm churns out about 2m barrels of oil a day, which makes it the eighth-largest producer globally. Pemex generates roughly $66bn of annual revenue but – as with <mark>Petrobras</mark> – relies heavily on international debt markets to fund its operations.</P><P>Currently, the Mexican firm has around $100bn of debt outstanding, putting it in a similar position as <mark>Petrobras</mark>. However, in contrast to its Brazilian counterpart, Pemex is experiencing a decline in production as its maturing oil fields peter out. At the same time, the Mexican producer is under pressure to reduce capex, partly to make good on its extraordinary tax obligation to the government.</P><P>In 2016, Pemex paid out about 90% of its operating profit in taxes, some of which was funded by debt. Over the last few years, too, the Mexican government has used Pemex in its initiative to constrain domestic petrol prices, resulting in operating losses for the company.</P><P>Needless to say, credit investors were not impressed. But Mexico is implementing a wide-ranging set of energy reforms that have, to a large extent, allayed the credit market’s concerns.</P><P>First, the reforms introduced a higher level of competition in the Mexican oil markets, opening up new partnership opportunities for Pemex that will help it address declining production problems and capex constraints. Second, the government has committed to gradually paring back the heavy tax burden it imposes on Pemex over 2016-2019 in a move that will significantly improve free cash flow. Third, the reforms will ensure that Mexican petrol prices are set by market forces by 2018. Pemex has already begun the process, with a national petrol-price hike of 15-20% this January.</P><P>The reforms, plus the bump in oil prices from the 2016 low, has seen Pemex achieve some significant improvements in the second quarter of 2017: dropping net leverage from 5-times to 4.0-times, and dramatically reducing its free cash flow deficit from $4.4bn a year ago to $0.4bn now.</P><P>As we assessed these developments, ESG concerns also entered the frame. They included: Pemex’s significantly below-par record on workers’ safety, and a poor environmental management history that featured numerous oil spills and leaks. To discuss these matters, we asked Hermes EOS to initiate conversations with Pemex. To its credit, the company was keen to take up the dialogue.</P><P>In particular, our discussions with the company’s sustainability team in May 2017 went some way to reassuring us about its commitment to better ESG practices. From this engagement, it was clear that Pemex was aware that it needed strong ESG performance to attract discerning investors in global debt markets. With the Mexican energy sector undergoing deregulation, Pemex can focus more on expansion and less on supporting the federal budget. Best-practice management of its operations will enable it to become more competitive.</P><P>The company has made some progress in lifting workforce health record to industry standard, citing a recent workplace safety campaign that mandated ‘zero tolerance’ for risky behaviour. And labour safety and <mark>carbon</mark>-emission-reduction targets have been published in its five-year business plan ending in 2021.</P><P>These actions to date augur well for Pemex, but we will continue to monitor the company against its stated ESG targets. We would certainly consider moving to an above-benchmark position in Pemex debt if it reduces ESG risks as planned – assuming, of course, the group’s credit profile remains stable and valuation sensible.</P><P><STRONG>The good oil</STRONG></P><P>Oil continues to be a vital resource for global society: despite the growing popularity of electric cars and the threat of fossil-fuel deposits becoming stranded assets, demand for the resource is likely to increase for the foreseeable future. For credit investors, knowledge of oil companies is essential, as they are the largest debt issuers in the high-yield market.</P><P>However, understanding their credit attributes is not enough. As demonstrated by the case studies above, the performance of both <mark>Petrobras</mark> and Pemex are driven by improving ESG dynamics, strongly supported by engagement, as well as traditional credit risks. By drilling deep into these companies, we identified non-financial aspects which could be improved to benefit the bottom line and therefore investment performance. ESG integration and engagement helped fuel the change.</P><P><A href=""https://www.hermes-investment.com/ukw/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2017/09/Hermes-Spectrum-Q3-2017.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Download the PDF version of this document.</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""footnotes-module""><DIV class=""container-980""><OL><LI><SUP class=""footnote"" id=""footnote-1"">1</SUP> To read a study by Hermes Credit and Hermes EOS about the impact of ESG risk on credit valuations, see “Pricing ESG risk in Credit Markets”, by Mitch Reznick and Dr Michael Viehs, published by Hermes Investment Management in April 2017.

The country’s investment environment is still challenging; complex regulations, economic turmoil, and the unstable political <mark>climate</mark> elevate the risk of doing business in Brazil. Nevertheless, EI expects that the combination of recent regulatory changes, the impressive size of the Brazilian pre-salt oil reserves, and their low breakevens that touch USD35/bbl will be enough to incentivize upstream operators and lead to over 2 MMb/d of pre-salt oil production by 2025 in a USD70/bbl oil world. The downstream refinery industry also has the potential to see traction, thanks to the undersupply of existing refinery capacity versus local product demand. Yet due to the risk associated with refining lead time, growth in the downstream will heavily depend on the government continuing to pursue market-friendly policies for an extended period of time.</P><H2>Upstream industry status-quo overhaul</H2><P>For upstream operators, Brazil has been a hotspot this decade. The country’s high-productivity pre-salt resources have proven to have high initial production rates, shallow decline rates, and low water breakthrough. In the last 4 years, production from pre-salt has already surpassed the 1 MMb/d mark, with wellhead breakevens resting as low as USD35/bbl. Costs have decreased as <mark>Petrobras</mark>, the preeminent pre-salt <G class=""gr_ gr_166 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_disable_anim_appear gr_inline_cards Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep"" id=""166"" data-gr-id=""166"">operator,</G> has developed a better understanding of the time, technology, and money necessary to properly develop a pre-salt field.</P><H4>Exhibit 1: Costs on pre-salt projects have been decreasing as the technology and understanding of the geological layer matures</H4><H6>Source: <mark>Petrobras</mark></H6><P>The pre-salt reserves are vast. The Santos basin, where all the major pre-salt fields are found today, was estimated by ANP to hold over 5.6 billion barrels of oil of proved reserves at the end of 2015. <mark>Petrobras</mark> alone is expected to deploy an additional 18 FPSOs in its offshore pre-salt region by 2020.</P><P>Until recently, the pre-salt story was a <mark>Petrobras</mark> story; a local law stipulated that only <mark>Petrobras</mark> could operate the pre-salt fields. Yet Brazil’s pre-salt operatorship law (Bill 131/2015) was overhauled in October, in an effort started by the previous government and finished by Michel <G class=""gr_ gr_151 gr-alert gr_spell gr_disable_anim_appear gr_inline_cards ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace"" id=""151"" data-gr-id=""151"">Temer’s</G> administration. The regulation overhaul opened up the country’s pre-salt resource through two access routes for E&amp;P companies. First, fields that <mark>Petrobras</mark> is not interested in developing become directly available to other players through an auction. Second, operators can now also directly purchase fields from <mark>Petrobras</mark> that the NOC is not interested in developing or operating anymore.</P><P>Given <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ inability to successfully develop all its pre-salt due to its mounting debt, which stood at USD126 Bn as of Q2 2016, the opening up of pre-salt to operators other than <mark>Petrobras</mark> presents a considerable number of attractive asset acquisition targets. On top of potential new fields that will be auctioned by the government, the company has laid out an ambitious divestment program. It has already sold ~USD4.6 Bn in upstream assets out of USD15.2 Bn <G class=""gr_ gr_299 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim gr_inline_cards Grammar multiReplace"" id=""299"" data-gr-id=""299"">in</G> the 15/16 plan and has announced plans to sell an additional USD19.5 Bn for the 17/18 period, although it is not specified what part would be E&amp;P.</P><H2>Downstream industry margins</H2><P>Brazil has a complicated and <G class=""gr_ gr_318 gr-alert gr_spell gr_run_anim gr_inline_cards ContextualSpelling multiReplace"" id=""318"" data-gr-id=""318"">much publicized</G> refinery industry. Theoretically, it could be called an economically promising market, as the country lacks adequate refining capacity despite its rising demand for refined products and availability of feedstock. Delays in the construction of additional refinery capacity by <mark>Petrobras</mark> have resulted in Brazil being long on crude but short on products, despite the economic recession. In 2016, the demand for light and mid-distillates surpassed available conversion capacity by more than 1.1 MMb/d, while oil and NGL production exceeded distillation capacity by 0.3 MMb/d. Yet while the market has not been regulated since 1997, the ownership of the logistic infrastructure by <mark>Petrobras</mark> had previously effectively discouraged competition. Before the recent economic crisis, it was common for <mark>Petrobras</mark> to align its product pricing with government policies, further complicating new market entries.</P><P>Nevertheless, as of October 2016, <mark>Petrobras</mark>, the owner of the vast majority of refinery capacity in Brazil, announced that it will price its fuels closer to international market rates instead of adhering to artificial prices in line with policy objectives set by the Brazilian government. The alignment with government directives has previously cost <mark>Petrobras</mark> billions per year. Even if the new pricing plan results in margin losses in the near term, a move towards market-driven pricing removes a lot of the risk associated with doing business in refining in Brazil both for <mark>Petrobras</mark> and for new entrants. In addition, it is anticipated that as pre-salt resources are further developed, the resulting high availability of feedstock will make Brazil even longer on crude and potentially improve local margins.</P><P><mark>Petrobras</mark>’ divestiture program could include refineries if there is interest, and it also includes its fuel distribution network, the largest one in Brazil. The company has also expressed interest in attracting capital from external stakeholders to finish the Comperj and <G class=""gr_ gr_301 gr-alert gr_spell gr_run_anim gr_inline_cards ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace"" id=""301"" data-gr-id=""301"">Rnest</G> refineries.</P><H2>Challenging investment and labor environment</H2><P>While investment opportunities have multiplied with policy changes and <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ divestiture program in both upstream and downstream, Brazil’s unstable political environment and regulations could make things more challenging as new players move in.</P><P>The current government was not elected by popular vote. Once the election cycle comes around, a potential new leadership could reverse the recent regulatory changes, introduce new rules or processes that may further complicate business, or the country may undergo a wave of reforms in response to the recent political upheaval, which could create an unstable investment environment. The risk is not immediate. It took the government almost 6 years to change the royalty structure even with <G class=""gr_ gr_314 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim gr_inline_cards Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep"" id=""314"" data-gr-id=""314"">voting</G> majority, and it usually takes about 2 years to introduce and approve regulations. Yet even a pause in the current effort to liberalize energy markets would be costly to future oil investment in Brazil.</P><P>Additionally, at a local level, Brazil’s regulations still tend to favor unions and obstruct profit-seeking operations—a significant setback for foreign operators. First, Brazil is an expensive location to hire foreign employees due to the fees and taxes paid to the government. While local labor is comparatively economic, any activity heating up like before 2012 could result again in capacity constraints of local personnel. On top of this, existing regulations make it complicated to hire both local and foreign workforce. Due to a system of laws that overwhelmingly protects the employee, Brazil is also home to a high number of labor claims—nearly 3 million in 2010 alone.</P><P>Lastly, the local content clause is still an active requirement for the upstream industry. Adherence to the law means operators are required to partly use local OFSE providers that will most likely not be the most cost-efficient, increasing the risk to profitability. And after the recent political scandals, many of the local suppliers and service providers formerly used by <mark>Petrobras</mark> have been blacklisted and are currently under investigation for corruption, or are already bankrupt. This lack of available cost-effective providers presents an added challenge for operators. Nevertheless, the government has announced it intends to relax minimum local content rules to assist pre-salt development so the impact of the clause is expected to be minimized.</P><H2>Does the reward outweigh the risks?</H2><H3>Upstream</H3><P>While entering Brazil independently—not as part of a joint venture with <mark>Petrobras</mark>—and adjusting to the country’s challenging rules and regulations may seem daunting, access to pre-salt resources is still a unique opportunity. The pre-salt resources have relatively low breakeven prices, long lives, and with the current budget crisis, both <mark>Petrobras</mark> and the Brazilian government are willing to share profits with external players.</P><P>It is EI’s expectation that pre-salt will end up being developed even under low prices, thanks to already sunk capital; the Lula field is already producing 700 kb/d with 2 more phases under way. In a USD 70/bbl Brent scenario, pre-salt would dominate offshore balances and help increase Brazil’s oil production by 60% by 2030; in the next 10 years, pre-salt production is expected to surpass 2 MMb/d, compared to 1 MMb/d in 2016.</P><H4>Exhibit 2: We project that this high risk, but high reward market will result in development of pre-salt, as the resource is too cheap not to be developed</H4><H6>EIA STEO, Energy Insights GLSM</H6><P>As local legacy production declines, we expect the state of Rio de Janeiro and the federal government to have an additional incentive to motivate operators to develop the pre-salt fields. Any kind of federal or regional incentives will further increase the expected profit margins for upstream operators. Overall, the government has proved it is actively seeking to help pre-salt development. For those reasons, we expect that A&amp;D activity will only increase going forward, turning Brazil’s upstream sector into an attractive, and active, investment arena.</P><P>Some companies have already decided the risk is worth it. Statoil acquired <G class=""gr_ gr_303 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim gr_inline_cards Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep"" id=""303"" data-gr-id=""303"">interest</G> in the Santos basin, including a significant part of the Carcará, for USD2.5 billion. Statoil estimates the recoverable volumes to be 700–1,300 MMboe and has already begun discussions with <mark>Petrobras</mark> regarding cooperation on future endeavors in the Campos and Espírito Santo basins. Shell has also announced that it plans to invest USD10 billion in the next five years, on top of the USD30 billion it has already invested in Brazil.</P><H3>Downstream</H3><P>The refinery industry is not as clear-cut of a potential investment target, as it is plagued more heavily by profitability uncertainty.</P><P>Even though the conditions are there to turn refining in Brazil into a profitable business in the near future, returns are more dependent on regulatory changes and the refining cycle, and thus the risk is still high. <G class=""gr_ gr_310 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim gr_inline_cards Punctuation replaceWithoutSep"" id=""310"" data-gr-id=""310"">We therefore</G> expect that the government and <mark>Petrobras</mark> will need to maintain a prolonged period of political stability and market-friendly <mark>climate</mark> before Brazil’s downstream can be considered a sought-after investment. For now, expectations are that distillation and conversion capacity will increase faster than demand, but still not fast enough to satisfy local product demand.</P><H4>Exhibit 3: Refinery Imbalance</H4><H6>Source: <mark>Petrobras</mark></H6><P>Nevertheless, we believe the regulators are moving in the right direction. Brazil downstream is a market that should be closely monitored in the upcoming years as a source of potential opportunities, especially as margins get squeezed in more mature markets.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""col""><DIV class=""wrapper quick-nav"" style=""color:#666666""><DIV class=""cta-newsletter""><H6>GET UPDATES</H6></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

			 ISSN 0103-4014.   http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/s0103-40142016.30880014.</P><P>This study examines the challenges and possibilities of the pre-salt oil reserves and the role of <mark>Petrobras</mark> to reconcile the expectations of their potential for social transformation in Brazil. Toward this end, it examines the role of the processes of social appropriation of energy in the social revolutions of humanity. It then examines the conditions and processes that led to the hegemony of oil vis-à-vis other energy alternatives and analyzes the consequences of this development. In the geopolitical and economic field, it reviews the contradictions and antagonistic interests in the dispute for control over access to oil resources and for the appropriation of oil income.</P><P>Within this geopolitical and strategic context, the essay focuses on the challenges and opportunities associated with the discovery of the Brazilian pre-salt reserves, and on the role of <mark>Petrobras</mark>, arguing for the need of critical examination of the current national strategy with regard to the identification, characterization and quantification of the oil reserves, and to establishment of the pace of production and exportation in coordination with OPEC and other exporting countries. This implies the revision of the current regulatory regime to ensure the generation of resources to be invested according to a national plan for economic and social development. Neither the concession nor the production-sharing regimes are suitable to ensure the hegemony of public interest in setting production and export control. However, the direct contracting of <mark>Petrobras</mark>, which is already authorized by applicable law, seems to be the most suitable system to allow flexibility similar to that of service contracts, where government control over production and export of oil prevails.</P><P>This work also summarizes the analysis of the expected financial results from the production of oil from the pre-salt reserves in Brazil. First, the oil production for each field is simulated. Then the expected revenue for the various stakeholders (business and government) is calculated under different scenarios of oil barrel price, investment and regulatory regimes. Results are presented for today's regulatory regimes concessions, production sharing, onerous assignment and onerous assignment with production sharing for surplus volumes), as well as for alternative regulatory frameworks, such as the service contracts system. One of the main results is an analysis of break-even prices for each oil field under each regulatory regime, indicating the minimum price per barrel that would make the production feasible from the perspective of the entrepreneur. The expected government revenues are also presented, as well as an estimate of the royalties intake that would go to health and education. Overall, the production-sharing regime is not the one that provides higher revenues to the government, at least not with the assumptions of the simulation, i.e., based on the rules and dynamics of State participation in the oil revenue defined according to the outcome of the auction of the Libra field. This seems contradictory, since the production-sharing regime was introduced in Brazil in 2010 after a national debate about the possibilities of increasing the government's share of the production in the pre-salt areas. The regime that would bring more revenue to the government was shown to be the services contract system, in which the State is the investor and owner of the reserves and of the production results. Therefore, measures that bring the current production-sharing regime now in place closer to the service contract system, as made possible by current legislation, would tend to increase government revenues. After the service contract regime system, the one that would offer the greatest government share is the concession regime, as the sum of special participations and of royalties normally exceeds the sum of the State's percentage of the surplus in oil and of royalties on a production-sharing basis, considering the assumptions adopted in the simulation (Libra field auction). Only in fields with large reserves and when the price of a barrel of oil is higher would government revenues be greater in the sharing scheme than in the concession contract scheme. We thus conclude that for the production-sharing regime to bring in more revenue for the government, there must exist mechanisms that ensure that the State's percentage of the oil surplus is higher than that of the auction of the Libra field, for example.</P><P>Last but not least, this essay analyses the two assets that comprise the public property in dispute, namely, oil reserves (substantially those of the pre-salt) and <mark>Petrobras</mark>, with its technological capacity. Other alternatives for production development and for the role of <mark>Petrobras</mark> are feasible: what differs is the potential to generate public resources to be invested in the amelioration of social liabilities. The primary contribution of this paper aims to elucidate conflicts of interest, alternative paths and potential outcomes, winners and losers.</P><P xmlns=""""><STRONG>Keywords

The deepwater fields which <mark>Petrobras</mark> and other multinational oil companies are looking to exploit hold colossal, untapped reserves described by one industry executive as <A href=""http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/07/04/brazil-galp-idUKN0433338020080704"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">“the new North Sea of the South”</A>.</P><P>The scandal – believed to be the largest in Brazil’s history – has intensified in recent weeks, <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/15/brazil-protesters-rouseff-impeachment-petrobas"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">sparking mass protests across the country</A>. President Dilma Rousseff is facing increased pressure as senior members of her ruling party are under investigation by the supreme court for their alleged role in the scandal. </P><P>Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bribes were allegedly skimmed from deliberately inflated <mark>Petrobras</mark> contracts, portions of which were paid to the president’s ruling party. Rousseff has denied knowledge of corruption despite chairing <mark>Petrobras</mark>’s board when much of the wrongdoing allegedly took place.</P><P>Witnesses have identified a raft of construction and engineering companies which allegedly paid bribes for <mark>Petrobras</mark> contracts. Two of these companies were significant beneficiaries of the UK’s package of support for the P-52 platform: Rolls Royce and a company majority owned by Singapore shipbuilder Keppel Corporation.</P><P>A former <mark>Petrobras</mark> executive, whose testimony is at the centre of the investigation, told police that a Keppel representative paid him and others – including Dilma Rousseff’s party – bribes specifically in relation to the P-52 contract.</P><P>This month, just as the scandal began to intensify, UKEF began considering a request to insure a multimillion dollar oil tanker in Brazil despite the fact its co-owners and operators, the Dutch shipbuilder SBM Offshore, and the parent company of its Brazilian joint venture partners, are under investigation.</P><P>On Wednesday SBM signed an agreement to cooperate with Brazilian authorities probing the scandal and last year two former Queiroz Galvão shareholders, the parent of SBM’s consortium partners, were arrested as part of the probe.</P><P>Over the past year, prosecutors in Brazil have heard how hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bribes were allegedly channelled to accounts at Swiss banks including HSBC Suisse, the bank at the at the heart of revelations about tax dodging and money laundering last month.</P><P>Brazilian journalists working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists have identified members of the Queiroz Galvão family and senior executives at its companies as clients of HSBC Suisse’s Geneva branch.</P><P>Asked by the Guardian whether UKEF was investigating its loans to <mark>Petrobras</mark> projects, a spokeswoman said the agency “continues to monitor developments with regard to <mark>Petrobras</mark> and will respond accordingly”. The spokeswoman added officials are undertaking due diligence in relation to insurance for the vessel and no decision has yet been made.</P><P>A spokesman for UKTI, whose representatives in Brazil have assisted UK firms in securing <mark>Petrobras</mark> contracts, said the agency had nothing to add to the UKEF statement.</P><P>Rolls Royce, who are currently facing separate bribery probes in the US and UK, said they have not received details of the allegations in Brazil. A spokesman added: “We have always been clear that we will not tolerate improper business conduct of any sort and will take all necessary action to ensure compliance.”</P><P>SBM Offshore told the Guardian that an internal investigation had raised “red flags” in Brazil but found no evidence of improper payments to government officials. A spokeswoman emphasised the company is now under a new management regime and said a settlement with Dutch prosecutors “has closed a chapter from the past”.</P><P>A spokeswoman for Keppel said the company strongly refutes allegations made regarding its Brazilian subsidiary, adding its employees comply with “applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, including anti-bribery laws”.</P><P>Responding to the Guardian’s questions, a spokeswoman for Queiroz Galvão said the group “denies any illicit payments to public officials in order to obtain contracts or benefits”, adding that the company’s contracts and activities adhere to Brazilian law. She said: “Queiroz Galvão states that any assets of company shareholders that could possibly exist in bank accounts outside Brazil have been strictly registered under Brazilian law and informed to legal authorities”. </P><P>This week marks the one-year anniversary of the sweeping investigation into the <mark>Petrobras</mark> scandal, known as “Operation Car Wash”.</P><P>Prosecutors – who are probing hundreds of companies and liaising with authorities around the world in an effort to uncover a sprawling network of bribery, money laundering, tax evasion and even drug trafficking – have said their investigation is far from complete. </P><DIV class=""submeta""><SPAN class=""submeta__label"">Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

(<mark>Petrobras</mark>) is joining the Switzerland-based Oil and Gas <mark>Climate</mark> Initiative</A>, whose member companies represent more than a quarter of the world’s oil and gas production. OGCI aims to speed and scale up initiatives taken by member companies to reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of their core oil and gas business and to explore new businesses and technologies.</P><P>But <mark>Petrobras</mark> has been selling off biofuel assets, like its biodiesel plants in Brazil and its eight sugar and ethanol assets in Brazil and Mozambique. And it has been lowering gas prices in Brazil putting pressure on ethanol demand. Is it contradictory to get rid of assets that would help GHG emissions and environmental impact while joining an initiative that aims to improve GHG emissions and environmental impact?</P><H4>OGCI details</H4><P><mark>Petrobras</mark>’ membership is pending approval of the OGCI <mark>Climate</mark> Investments Members’ Agreement by the <mark>Petrobras</mark> Board of Directors. The OGCI is the CEO-led grouping of oil and gas companies that intends to lead the industry’s response to <mark>climate change</mark>, pooling knowledge and collaborating on action to reduce greenhouse emissions. The OGCI’s existing members are BP, CNPC, Eni, Pemex, Repsol, Saudi Aramco, Shell, Statoil and Total.</P><P><mark>Petrobras</mark> CEO Pedro Parente said, “By joining OGCI, one of the industry’s leading initiatives on <mark>climate change</mark> response, <mark>Petrobras</mark> renews its commitment to reducing emissions and to a more efficient energy matrix and reinforces its strategic command to be fully prepared for a low <mark>carbon</mark> world. We are excited to join other OGCI member companies in their efforts to deliver the organisation’s ambitious goals.”</P><P>With a presence in 19 countries and about 70,000 employees, <mark>Petrobras</mark> is a large company that is pretty diverse in what it does. From exploration and production to refining and marketing, it works all along the supply chain. It also goes beyond petrochemicals and oil and into natural gas and until recently, biofuel segments.</P><P>Welcoming <mark>Petrobras</mark> to the initiative, Bob Dudley, chair of the OGCI’s CEO Steering Committee and group chief executive of BP, said, “International and national oil companies have come together in the OGCI to work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a key challenge for our industry and the world. <mark>Petrobras</mark>’s participation will increase the critical mass and momentum of our work and extends our coverage into an important new geography – South America.”</P><H4>So why is this important?</H4><P><mark>Petrobras</mark>’ involvement with OGCI signals that they are taking GHG issues seriously and taking action to lower their environmental impact. By joining other big oil companies and sharing knowledge and collaborate on action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they are trying to improve.</P><P>OGCI, launched in 2014, aims to increase the ambition, speed and scale of the initiatives they undertake as individual companies to reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of their core oil and gas business, and to explore new businesses and technologies. Its billion-dollar investment arm, OGCI <mark>Climate</mark> Investments, supports the development, deployment and scale-up of low emissions technology.</P><P>This is good news for <mark>Petrobras</mark> after several weeks of not-so-great news regarding the latest <A href=""http://www.<mark>petrobras</mark>.com.br/en/news/<mark>petrobras</mark>-signs-agreement-in-principle-to-settle-class-action-in-the-u-s.htm"">securities class action lawsuit</A> filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Under the proposed settlement, <mark>Petrobras</mark> agreed to pay $2.95 billion to resolve claims in two installments of $983 million and a last installment of $984 million – making it one of the <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-<mark>petrobras</mark>-classaction/<mark>petrobras</mark>-to-pay-2-95-billion-to-settle-u-s-corruption-lawsuit-idUSKBN1ES0L2"">largest securities class action settlements</A> in U.S. history.</P><P>According to Reuters, “With the settlement, it will <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-<mark>petrobras</mark>-classaction/<mark>petrobras</mark>-to-pay-2-95-billion-to-settle-u-s-corruption-lawsuit-idUSKBN1ES0L2"">pay out more than six times</A> what it has received so far under a Brazilian probe into bribery schemes that involved company executives and government officials. The settlement…was an important milestone for the oil firm as it tries to emerge from the scandal that has entangled two former Brazilian presidents and dozens of the country’s corporate executives.”</P><P><mark>Petrobras</mark> is quick to say in their press release, “<A href=""http://www.<mark>petrobras</mark>.com.br/en/news/<mark>petrobras</mark>-signs-agreement-in-principle-to-settle-class-action-in-the-u-s.htm"">The agreement does not constitute any admission of wrongdoing or misconduct by <mark>Petrobras</mark></A>. In the agreement, <mark>Petrobras</mark> expressly denies liability. This reflects its status as a victim of the acts uncovered by Operation Car Wash, as recognized by Brazilian authorities including the Brazilian Supreme Court. As a victim of the scheme, <mark>Petrobras</mark> has already recovered R$1.475 billion in restitution in Brazil and will continue to pursue all available legal remedies from culpable companies and individuals.”</P><P>The agreement is in the SDNY district court pending review, and if granted, the court will notify the members of the class of the terms of the proposed settlement.</P><P>This is a smart move by <mark>Petrobras</mark> – by dealing with the litigation in a settlement, it avoids trial and a jury, and the risks associated with the uncertainties and costs of long litigation.</P><H4>Is <mark>Petrobras</mark> divesting from biofuels?</H4><P>To much dismay, yes, even as <mark>Petrobras</mark> is trying to improve environmental impact by joining OGCI and figuring out ways to lower GHG emissions, <A href=""http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2017/12/18/<mark>petrobras</mark>-divesting-bsbios-in-next-step-of-asset-fire-sale/""><mark>Petrobras</mark> is continuing with its divestiture plans</A> by getting rid of its 50% stake in BSBios that owns two biodiesel plants in Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná with a total installed production capacity of 288,000 cubic meters. As reported in the Digest in December, the company’s other 50% is held by R.P. Biocombustiveis Holding who has first right to buy out the 50% or divest completely as well. Last year BSBios had gross revenues of $681 million following the sale of 413,000 cubic meters of biodiesel at auction.</P><P>Back in February 2017, as reported in The Digest, <A href=""http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2017/02/07/tereos-finalizes-purchase-of-<mark>petrobras</mark>-45-9-guarani-stake/"">Tereos purchased <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ 45.9% Guarani stake for $202 million in cash</A>. This made France-based Tereos the 100% sole owner of Guarani’s eight sugar and ethanol assets in Brazil and Mozambique. The deal was agreed in December as <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ final divestiture from the ethanol industry.</P><P>As reported in the Digest in June 2017, <A href=""http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2017/06/19/<mark>petrobras</mark>-lowers-gas-prices-for-second-time-in-a-month/""><mark>Petrobras</mark> lowered gas prices for a second time that month</A>, causing further pressures on ethanol demand. Despite hydrous ethanol prices being 68% of gasoline prices during the week ending June 10, the lowest since September last year, falling gas prices see drivers still choosing fossil fuels over ethanol. Hydrous prices have fallen 6% since the sugarcane crush started in April and by 3% during the past month.</P><P>Interesting timing, we think, as this is just months after divesting from ethanol.</P><H4>Bottom Line</H4><P><mark>Petrobras</mark>’ biofuel webpage states, “<A href=""http://www.<mark>petrobras</mark>.com.br/en/our-activities/performance-areas/biofuel-production/"">We will terminate our biofuel production activities aiming to optimize our business portfolio</A>.”</P><P>So what is <mark>Petrobras</mark> really trying to do by joining OGCI, an initiative for oil and gas companies to lower GHG emissions, just months after selling off its biodiesel plants and almost a year after selling off ethanol and sugar assets in Brazil and Mozambique? Wouldn’t biodiesel and ethanol investments and assets improve their GHG impact?</P><P>It remains to be seen how exactly <mark>Petrobras</mark> will improve its environmental impact and how it will use the OGCI initiative after selling off the assets that seem most likely to improve GHG emissions over the last year. Maybe they will re-evaluate or reconsider biofuels in the future? Maybe they will continue R&amp;D in the biofuel segment? We’ll be keeping an eye on this.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The fine, which was only made public this week, was halved to 15,000 francs following an appeal.The executive was penalized for failing to notify Swiss regulators about suspicious money transfers by former Petróleo Brasileiro executive Nestor Cerveró, who was jailed in Brazil in 2015 for corruption offenses.The Swiss court found that the Heritage executive failed to prevent Cerveró transferring almost $200,000 out of his bank account between December 2014 and January 2015 despite the fact that he was under investigation by the Brazilian authorities.This breached Swiss money-laundering regulations, the Swiss court ruled. The executive acted negligently, the court said, but it added that the offense was “mild to moderate.” It could have levied a fine of up to 150,000 Swiss francs.The bank did eventually report the issue to Swiss regulators after the Cerveró investigation was reported in Brazil’s media. The bank didn’t respond to a request for comment today.Swiss prosecutors told MLex in November they were considering bringing criminal charges against Swiss banks linked to widespread corruption allegations involving <mark>Petrobras</mark>.Swiss banks have been heavily linked to Brazil’s Lava Jato case. The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland began investigating allegations of bribery linked to <mark>Petrobras</mark> in 2014. It has seized around one billion Swiss francs linked to Brazilian corruption probes, returning 200 million francs to Brazil.The executive’s lawyer declined to comment, as did Switzerland’s Federal Department of Finance and its financial regulator Finma.</P><SECTION class=""share-links""><DIV class=""title"">Share this </DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The bill moved on to the Senate, which on 12 December approved it by 27 votes to 20. But that’s not the end of it: The text of the bill was altered in the Senate and so must go back to the Chamber of Deputies for another vote, which needs to act by this Friday, 15 December, or the legislation loses its validity and expires.</P><P>Under the original House and Senate bills, PM 795 provides huge tax breaks as incentives for offshore drilling. It eliminates for an indefinite period a government requirement for transnational oil companies to pay a social contribution on their net profits and income federal tax. The bill, if passed this week, would suspend the payment of import taxes and a tax on industrialized products. The corporate tax waiver would cost Brazil – an economically stressed nation in dire need of revenue – R$ 40 billion (about US$ 13 billion) per year, or R$ 1 trillion (US$ 300 billion) over 25 years, according to a congressional technical study.</P><P>However, under strong opposition pressure, Senator Romero Jucá presented an amendment on Tuesday reversing a portion of the text as approved by the House of Deputies that was in conflict with Brazil’s Annual Budget Law (LOA). The House deputies had originally established that the suspension of taxes would occur until 2040. But the Budget Law only allows incentives of up to five years, or until 2022, which is what led to the adjustment in PM 795 and its return for a second vote to the House.</P><P>This still didn’t eliminate Senate opposition: “This provisional measure is the official theft of national public money,” protested senator Lindbergh Farias.</P><P><A href=""http://www.<mark>petrobras</mark>.com.br/en/our-activities/performance-areas/oil-and-gas-exploration-and-production/pre-salt/"" data-wpel-link=""external"" target=""_blank"" rel=""external"">Daily oil output at the pre-salt layer</A> soared from approximately 41,000 barrels per day in 2010, to 1 million barrels per day in mid-2016, a nearly 24-fold increase, with more rapid expansion expected if PM 795 is approved. The pre-salt area encompasses 149,000 square kilometers (57,529 square miles) of ocean, an area nearly three and a half times the size of Rio de Janeiro state.</P><P>Contacted by Mongabay, the Civil House of the Presidency’s communications office referred questions concerning PM 795 to the Ministry of Mines and Energy. The MME, in turn, referred questions about oil exploration in the pre-salt layer to the Ministry of the Environment. And the Ministry of the Environment, as already mentioned maintained its commitment to the Paris Agreement.</P><FIGURE id=""attachment_202091"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Brazilian Mines and Energy Minister Fernando Coelho Filho during the October 2017 pre-salt block oil and gas auction in Rio de Janeiro.

Meanwhile, Environmental Minister José Sarney Filho is expected to leave the government in order to run for office In Brazil’s October elections.</P><P>“The Temer government has not even considered investing [significantly] in renewable sources of energy, such as solar and wind.

But according to bill supporters, individuals could use part of their FGTS to purchase solar equipment for their homes.</P><P>Meanwhile, PM 795 has a very good chance of passage by Friday in light of a resumption of major auctions for oil and gas exploration blocks in the offshore pre-salt region. Ten rounds of bids have been authorized to occur between 2017 and 2019. This year, the auctions held in September and October raised, respectively, R$ 3.84 billion (about US$ 1.28 billion) and R$ 6.15 billion (US$ 2.05 billion), money that will be used to reduce the country’s 2017 fiscal deficit.</P><P>The country’s September oil auction saw a consortium made up of Brazil’s <mark>Petrobras</mark> and Exxon Mobil as the big winners.

This perspective motivated <mark>PETROBRAS</mark>, the National Oil Major in Brazil, through its R&amp;D investments portfolio to prioritize research projects that would contribute to decreasing the technological gap in the area. The Company's periodic surveys indicated the lack of infrastructure, as well as expertise in CO<SUB>2</SUB> MMV, as two of the most critical issues at the national level. In order to bridge that gap, initial steps were taken in 2010 for the start-up and development of the first CO<SUB>2</SUB> MMV Field Lab in Brazil, fully sponsored by <mark>PETROBRAS</mark>, with a long term goal of enabling the ranking of the best, most cost- effective MMV technology alternatives to be deployed at commercial large scale CCGS sites scheduled to be installed in the country. In addition to providing basic infrastructure to carry out the CO<SUB>2</SUB> injection and controlled release experiments, the facility was designed for the simultaneous testing of multiple measuring methodologies. Additional benefits of the initiative are the creation of expertise and the acceleration of the know-how in MMV in Brazil, as well as the development of a deeper and more practical knowledge of CO<SUB>2</SUB> dynamics and impacts in a real world, open air scenario. Under the full support of the <mark>PETROBRAS</mark> R&amp;D Center (CENPES), through its <mark>Climate Change</mark> Mitigation Technological Program (PROCLIMA), the Brazilian Pilot CO<SUB>2</SUB> MMV Lab was made possible through a joint 4-year research Project, conceived and carried out by <mark>PETROBRAS</mark> and local academia in Brazil, in close cooperation with international experts. An overview of the Project and the multiple research areas encompassed will be presented, together with the preliminary results of the first CO<SUB>2</SUB> injection campaign, which took place in 2013.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><UL class=""issue-navigation"" id=""issue-navigation""><LI class=""previous""><BUTTON class=""button-alternative button-alternative-tertiary"" disabled="""" type=""button""><SPAN class=""button-alternative-text""><SPAN><STRONG>Previous </STRONG>article<SPAN class=""extra-detail""> in issue</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></BUTTON></LI></UL></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

As a result, Brazil succeeded in cutting its total GHG emissions<A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/global_warming/Brazil-s-Success-in-Reducing-Deforestation.pdf""><U>by 39 percent</U></A> during that same interval, achieving the fastest rate of emissions decline of any country in the world. Since 2013, however,<A href=""http://www.newsweek.com/2015/04/03/brazils-deforestation-rates-are-rise-again-315648.html""><U>the rate of deforestation has begun to increase again</U></A> and has nearly tripled since 2013, according to the most recent satellite data from the independent Brazilian monitoring group Imazon. Last year, 1,228 square miles of forest were cut down, according to the group, an area larger than Rhode Island.</P><P>Under President Dilma Rousseff, the rate of deforestation accelerated twice in three years, but signs of a rightward turn by Brazil’s new government under Dilma’s vice president – now acting President Temer – have alarmed conservationists and <mark>climate</mark>-change activists, who fear a further rollback of environmental laws that would spark an even sharper uptick in deforestation rates in the Amazon basin.</P><H2>Brazil’s <mark>Climate</mark> Targets and Ambition Under Rousseff</H2><P>While Rouseff’s record on environmental conservation is far from perfect, her administration did set ambitious targets for Brazil’s forestry and land sector, including a goal to ​end illegal deforestation by 2030 and a target to restore 12 million hectares of forest and restore 5 million hectares of degraded pasture land by the same year. These goals were enshrined in<A href=""http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Brazil/1/BRAZIL%20iNDC%20english%20FINAL.pdf""><U>Brazil’s INDC</U></A> to the Paris process along with commitments to:</P><UL><LI><P>cut total emission by 37% from 2005 levels by 2025; </P></LI><LI><P>step up those reductions of total emission to 42% from 2005 levels by 2030; </P></LI><LI><P>set a long-term goal for de<mark>carbon</mark>isation by 2100.</P></LI></UL><P>Additionally, Rouseff announced that Brazil will aim to scale up renewables to be 45% of total energy sources by 2030. In the power sector, Brazil set a target to scale up renewables to comprise 89% of energy sources by 2030 and derive 66% of its power from hydro energy (down from the current 68% of its power that it gets from hydro). Brazil will also scale up solar, wind and biomass (non-hydro renewables) to comprise 23% of its generative capacity by 2030; the country has also committed to improving its energy efficiency by 10% by 2030.</P><P>Under Dilma, Brazil also played a crucial role in the UN negotiations that ultimately secured the Paris Agreement on <mark>climate change</mark>. Brazil co-chaired with Singapore a working group on differentiation that was instrumental in brokering an agreeable way forward between developed and developing countries. Furthermore, Brazil was a critical member of the High Ambition Coalition (HAC) of countries that helped steer the Paris Agreement away from a lowest common denominator solution. By joining the coalition at a strategic moment in the talks, Brazil brought clout and legitimacy to the HAC and established it as an influential body in the negotiations pulling across developed, small island, and large developing nations.</P><H2>Ratifying the Paris Agreement in Brazil: Current Status and Full Process</H2><P>In mid-June 2016, Brazil greatly accelerated the process to ratify the Paris Agreement when the country’s<A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changenews.com/2016/07/14/brazil-takes-a-step-towards-ratifying-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal/""><U>House of Representatives decided that the ratification bill did not need to pass through and be approved at committee level</U></A>. Instead the Parliament’s lower house agreed to a legislative decree to ratify the Paris Agreement. The bill now advances to the Senate where <A href=""http://www.observatoriodoclima.eco.br/camara-aprova-ratificacao-do-acordo-de-paris/""><U>it is expected to be approved during the coming weeks or months</U></A>. After the bill passes the Senate, it will require the Acting President Temer’s approval in order for it to become enshrined in domestic law.</P><P>Despite the mixed executive and parliamentary process required for Brazil to join the Paris Agreement it is increasingly likely that Brazil will be able to meet these steps and ratify the Agreement before the end of the 2016 calendar year.  By ratifying the agreement in 2016, Brazil will move the world <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/jake-schmidt/paris-agreement-very-likely-enter-force-year""><U>2.6% closer</U></A> to the emissions threshold needed for the Paris Agreement to enter into force.</P><P>While Brazil is on track to join the Paris Agreement in a timely manner it is less on track to reining in its own greenhouse gas emissions and there are signs that despite the country’s ambitious <mark>climate</mark> targets its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint is likely to get worse not better.</P><H2>Economic Slowdown and Political Crisis Threaten Brazil’s <mark>Climate</mark> Record</H2><P>Brazil’s economy, which was already in dire crisis during Paris, has since sunk into its worst economic slump since the 1930s. Aggravating and aggravated by Brazil’s economic collapse and strained national budget is a corruption scandal involving kickbacks from <mark>Petrobras</mark> contracts to a range of politicians and private sector stakeholders. Nearly 50% of Brazil’s sitting parliament is implicated in a corruption investigation of some sort, with several implicated in the <mark>Petrobras</mark> probe itself. Dilma Rousseff had been the board chair of <mark>Petrobras</mark> under her predecessor Lula’s presidency while the corrupt contracts were being awarded. [AF1] Although Dilma herself has not been directly implicated in the corrupt transactions she either knew they were taking place and did nothing to stop them or she was oblivious that they were taking place under her nose, neither case is a strong testament to the integrity of her leadership and her popularity has plummeted as a result. There is also growing evidence that Dilma was ousted in an brazen seizure of power by her political opposition and with the explicit intent of impeding the investigation into the <mark>Petrobras</mark> scandal in which several sitting (and recently promoted) political office holders are implicated and which Dilma was allowing to proceed without interference. On May 12th<A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/world/americas/dilma-rousseff-brazil-impeachment.html?_r=0""><U>Brazil’s Senate voted to begin impeachment proceedings against Rousseff</U></A> triggering her suspension and the ascension to acting President of her Vice President from the more conservative competing PMDB party, Michel Temer.</P><P>Immediately Temer began openly advocating for a more business-friendly agenda to spur growth which reinvigorated longstanding tensions between Brazil’s economic development and environmental agendas. Brazil’s leadership has espoused a natural resource heavy, export-led growth model to reignite the economy.</P><P>Even under Dilma’s presidency the government was hungrily eyeing exploitation of the deep off shore oil field, known as the Pre-Salt reserves, as Brazil’s best income source. Dilma even publicly articulated<A href=""http://www.nivela.org/articles/post-election-brazil-new-conditions-old-models/en""><U>a vision of reinvesting</U></A> the revenue derived from oil export in education and other social welfare programs.  The Pre-Salt fields are so big that, if exploited, Brazil could become one of the largest oil producing nations globally.  However, the plunge in the global oil price has<A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/16/us-<mark>petrobras</mark>-brent-idUSKCN0I503620141016""><U>scuttled that plan</U></A> and Temer is turning the country’s search for development resources and revenues in a familiar direction, towards the Amazon Rainforest. Temer lost no time in appointing a new conservative-leaning cabinet whose members include figures with close ties to powerful landowners and agribusiness companies including the New Agriculture Minister, Maggi, who is the former governor of the state of Mato Grosso (afflicted by the largest increase in deforestation in recent years) and the largest soy baron in the country. The negative forcing between deforestation, soy and cattle production will become clear in the next section.</P><P>Brazilian lawmakers in the new government are considering <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazils-new-government-may-be-less-likely-to-protect-the-amazon-critics-say/2016/05/21/22cbce08-1c7d-11e6-82c2-a7dcb313287d_story.html""><U>a major overhaul of environmental laws</U></A>. This includes a controversial constitutional amendment known as <A href=""https://www25.senado.leg.br/web/atividade/materias/-/materia/109736""><U>PEC 65</U></A> that would reduce licensing requirements for development projects and limit judicial oversight of their impact. Many of these politicians answer to powerful, wealthy constituencies who fully support weak forest protection policies and make up the growing strength of the mining and agricultural lobbies in the country.</P><H2>Drivers of Deforestation in Brazil – the <mark>Carbon</mark> Hoof Print of Cattle Ranching</H2><P>Over the last four decades, Brazil has gone from being an importer to the second largest exporter of agricultural commodities in the world. During this period, the country has tripled its land productivity, becoming an agribusiness giant and the <A href=""http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/international-markets-trade/countries-regions/brazil.aspx""><U>biggest exporter of soy in the world</U></A>. Soy and the cattle ranching that much of the soy is transformed into feed to support are principal drivers of deforestation in Brazil. <A href=""http://blog.ucsusa.org/doug-boucher/whats-driving-deforestation-now""><U>70% of the deforestation in the Amazon is due to animal agriculture</U></A>– raising cattle, and soy to feed the cattle and 60% of deforested land becomes pasture.</P><P>Because of loose land laws <A href=""http://www.academia.edu/2762503/Persistance_of_cattle_ranching_in_the_Brazilian_Amazon_a_spatial_analysis_of_the_rationale_for_beef_production""><U>cattle have been used to justify land claims</U></A>, incentivizing inefficient land use and ranching practices used to grab large pieces of territory. Therefore logging, land grabbing, deforestation and cattle go hand-in-hand in the destruction of the Amazon. Once the land is cleared people can move cows onto it and claim ownership. Land ownership has always been an important store of wealth in Brazil but the draw of landholding tends to grow when other economic sectors of the country are faltering.</P><P>The <mark>carbon</mark> footprint created by meat production <A href=""https://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10568/75631/CCAFS%20Info%20Note%20GII%20Brazil%20May%2027%202016%20final.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y""><U>is huge</U></A> accounting for an estimated 50% of all greenhouse gas emissions in Brazil, equivalent to over 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover beef exports have increased about <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-beef-exports-idUSL2N0CS1GK20130405""><U>25% annually</U></A> and are now poised to <A href=""http://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/livestock_poultry.PDF""><U>rise even higher</U></A> due to a recent lift of the US’ embargo on Brazilian beef imports.</P><H2>Brazil’s Water Crisis: Deforestation, Demand and Drought</H2><P>However, a combination of changing precipitation patterns driven by loss of forest coverage and changes in the <mark>climate</mark> mixed with poor resource management are producing the <A href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-30962813""><U>most severe drought Brazil has seen in eighty years</U></A>. The drought poses a major risk to Brazil’s lucrative agricultural sector and has affected a large swath of the country.  If the drought continues it could greatly hamper the growth and damage the productivity of Brazil’s agro and ranching business.</P><P>Since Brazil’s latest mega hydro project, the Belo Monte dam, was completed the country can now source <A href=""http://about.bnef.com/content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/BNEF_RN_Renewables-targets-vs-NEO_2015-07-20_v3.pdf""><U>75% of its total generative electrical capacity</U></A> from hydropower. However, Brazil’s hydropower is currently being hit hard by a drought that many studies have attributed in part to <mark>climate change</mark> although the greater contributor has been poor resource management and exploding city populations creating rises in demand that are outpacing rises in supply.  As of 2015, seventeen of Brazil’s eighteen largest reservoirs were depleted and water rationing was in effect<A href=""http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2015/01/1574315-off-season-drought-makes-93-brazilian-cities-cut-off-water.shtml""><U>in 93 cities</U></A>.  Brazil has experienced increasingly frequent rolling blackouts and has had to turn to importing electricity from neighboring Argentina to meet its shortfall.</P><H2>Ripe conditions for infectious disease spread: the Zika pandemic</H2><P>The devastating outbreak of the vector borne disease known as Zika transmitted by the Aedes Aegypti mosquito has further strained Brazil’s coping capacity.</P><P>The virus, which can be transmitted from mother to fetus during pregnancy, has been linked to an increase in miscarriages, and deaths in newborns, and birth defects, especially a condition known as<A href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6503e2er.htm""><U>microcephaly</U></A>,in which the brain does not fully develop and babies are born with abnormally small heads. The disease has afflicted a reported <A href=""http://outbreaknewstoday.com/brazil-zika-virus-and-microcephaly-update-31559/""><U>138,108 people</U></A> across Brazil as of late June of which 48,821 are confirmed cases and just over 1500 of which are incidents of microcephaly.</P><H2>Brazil’s Energy Situation</H2><P>Brazil’s current infrastructure, especially its electricity infrastructure, is <A href=""http://trade.gov/topmarkets/pdf/Smart_Grid_Brazil.pdf""><U>insufficient to meet demand</U></A>, threatening to overload existing grids and cause critical failures, like the nearly nationwide blackout that occurred in 2009.  Brazil’s populace is increasingly aware of the <mark>climate</mark> impacts already taking place in Brazil and the unreliability of both fossil fuels and hydroelectricity to provide the energy the country needs and are increasing pressure on the country’s leadership to find new solutions.</P><P>These pressures will push Brazil to start adding new energy sources into its mix.  Brazil set a target under Dilma to scale up solar, wind and biomass (non-hydro renewables) to comprise <A href=""http://about.bnef.com/content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/BNEF_RN_Renewables-targets-vs-NEO_2015-07-20_v3.pdf""><U>20% of its electrical generative capacity by 2030</U></A>. Furthermore, the country has also committed to improving its energy efficiency ten percent by 2030. Despite these positive moves, however, Brazil will remain far too reliant on hydropower. Brazil’s target to scale up renewables to comprise 89% of energy sources by 2030 actually masks a target to derive 55% of its power from hydro energy (down from the current 75% of its power that it gets from hydro) and the remainder to be derived from non-hydro sources. Considering the problems with big hydro the intention to decrease Brazil’s reliance on hydroelectricity is a welcome move but far from ambitious enough.</P><P>If Brazil continues to dismantle and reverse its environmental protections the impacts will not only damage Brazil but will and are already having detrimental consequences far beyond the country’s borders. As global attention turns towards Brazil during the summer of 2016 as the South American giant gets set to host the Summer Olympics it is worth understanding the causes and effects of the political and economic turmoil gripping the country and its connections to patterns of environmental destruction (namely the rampant expansion of large-scale soy and beef production propelling accelerated rates of deforestation) that have outsized impacts globally.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Speaking to a crowd gathered on opening day of CERAWeek by IHS Markit, Sætre said renewable energy costs are falling amid rapid technology <mark>innovation</mark>. The company believes renewables, which is the fastest growing source of new power generation capacity, will become cost-competitive without subsidies, Sætre said.</P><P>“We all know that oil and gas will continue to be a significant mix of the energy mix for decades to come; however, we have to respond more forcibly to the challenges of <mark>climate change</mark>, reducing CO<SUB>2</SUB> and methane emissions,” he said, noting this will come with a cost but added companies who address such challenges will have a competitive advantage.</P><P>Sætre was joined on stage by <mark>Petrobras</mark> CEO Pedro Parente. The two took part in a discussion, moderated by IHS Markit Vice Chairman Daniel Yergin, on leadership. Each has served in their CEO roles for less than three years and, like many executives, both have faced challenges.</P><P>Yergin pointed out how Parente, who was appointed CEO of <mark>Petrobras</mark> in May 2016, was charged with the “urgent task of restoring confidence in the company and repairing its finances after being forced to write off billions of dollars,” the result of fallout from a corruption scandal uncovered by an investigation called Operation Car Wash.</P><P>Parente stressed that the company and most of its employees were “victims of this corruption scheme, not an agent, no benefit whatsoever,” only huge financial losses. Since the beginning of 2015, the situation has changed for <mark>Petrobras</mark>, which has worked to reduce its debt by carrying out a more than $15 billion divestment program.</P><P>“The fact that our company moved in the newspapers from the scandal page to the business page is very good, but it’s important to stress that this is just the beginning of a long work,” he said. “We appreciate the recognition but also are humbled by the responsibility and the challenges that are ahead of us. We will recover credibility as we deliver the results that we promise. That is pretty much what we are doing now.”</P><P>These challenges came along with the added obstacles of coping with a recession, fiscal imbalances and reforms, including freeing itself from requirements to serve as operator of all of the country’s presalt acreage, and then, there was the downturn.</P><P>In this regard, Sætre and Parente faced similar challenges as major oil and gas players with global assets both onshore and offshore.</P><P>Sætre became head of Statoil in mid-October 2014, just before the oil price crash changed life for the oil industry. At the time, Sætre remembered the price for a barrel of oil being $90, then the price collapsed—serving as another reminder that the industry is cyclical, he said. Although the last few years have been challenging, he recalled the saying: “You should never ever waste a good crisis.”</P><P>Statoil has reset the cost base, reworking solutions and increasing efficiency from reservoirs to the market, he said.</P><P>Breakeven costs for Statoil’s so-called next-generation portfolio—which includes projects such as the North Sea’s Johan Sverdrup and Oseberg Vestflanken, Johan Castberg in the Barents Sea, Peregrino II offshore Brazil and Trestakk in the Norwegian Sea with anticipated startups by 2022—from more than $70/bbl to less than $30/bbl.</P><P>“Turns out we are capable of both thinking and acting low-cost when we have to. However, to meet the ultimate test of our ability to learn lies not in the crisis itself but in the recovery. Now is not the time to relax and repeat our mistakes from the past. Now is the time to fundamentally change how we run this industry.”</P><P>Ways to accomplish this include:</P><UL style=""list-style-type:square""><LI>Learning from peers;</LI><LI>Introducing lean manufacturing methodologies; and</LI><LI>Embracing simplification, standardization and industrialization, he said.</LI></UL><P>The CERAWeek stage was not the first time the two companies have come together. <mark>Petrobras</mark> sold a 66% stake in the Carcara presalt oil discovery in the Santos Basin, to Statoil in a $2.5 billion deal in 2016. The deal helped <mark>Petrobras</mark> move closer to its year-end 2016 goal of selling more than $15 billion of assets. Later that year, the two agreed to work together to stop falling production at aging offshore wells.</P><P><I>Velda Addison can be reached at <A href=""mailto:vaddison@hartenergy.com"">vaddison@hartenergy.com</A> or via Twitter @VeldaAddison.</I></P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Only the PRD has remained silent on the opening of PEMEX’s monopoly, conscious of its political base among the second largest union in Mexico, after the teachers union. Polling surveys indicate that the public are comfortable with national ownership of the petroleum resource, but a clear majority is not against the transfer of PEMEX to private ownership.  As on several other issues, Mexican citizens demonstrate greater pragmatism than their political elites. </P><P>A national holiday recalls the day on which President Lázaro Cardenas nationalized the oil industry on March 18, 1938.  After 21 years of wrangling with the Standard Oil of New Jersey and Royal Dutch Shell over royalties, the revolutionary and nationalistic mood in Mexico led to the expropriation of oil interests with the payment based on the value of current revenue.  Exploration, oil rigs, refining and pipelines to urban users remained the property of the state.  The PEMEX oil workers only union has remained the guardian ever since.  Union bosses still wield excessive control over both hiring and certain management issues within the company. Corruption is rampant.  Currently, PEMEX has a debt of $56 billion.<A name=""_ftnref4"" href=""#_ftn4"" id=""_ftnref4"">[4]</A>  The reforms of 2008 have resulted in sub-contracts for technology and technical expertise, but all such contracts were preceded by intense debate with the union.  PEMEX was to remain a national treasure.</P><P>At its peak in 2003, the nation’s treasure produced 2.2 billion barrels per day (BP/d).  Cantarell, discovered in 1976 by a fisherman, Rudesindo Cantarell, is the second largest oil reservoir in the world, comprising four oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico.  For a number of years, nitrogen injection kept oil levels up, but current production has fallen to 440,000 million BP/d.<A name=""_ftnref5"" href=""#_ftn5"" id=""_ftnref5"">[5]</A>  International geologists have determined that Cantarell’s best days are over and that lower revenues must be expected in the future.  </P><P>Income from PEMEX provides one third of federal revenues and enables the distribution of social services, as well as government salaries without the need to raise taxes.  Within Mexico, there exists a reliance on PEMEX for necessary federal expenditures.  This dependency also encourages the avoidance of tax payments and the growth within the economy of the informal sector which pays minimum, if any taxation.  Also, subsidized gas prices, distributed through PEMEX stations, have kept inflation low.</P><P>The decline in Cantarell’s production has coincided with a rise in Mexico’s middle class and increased use of automobiles and industrial products.  Electricity is both sold to the U.S.A. and bought from Texan electrical generating companies.  Slowly, the recognition that PEMEX could not produce enough energy to sustain the needs of a growing Mexican state has grown.  When President Calderón proposed energy reforms in 2008, he was met with howls of protest.  Three years later, skepticism – not protest – on how to accomplish the reform met Enrique Peña’s proposal. </P><P>The catalyst for change came from Inácio Lula da Silva who addressed a Mexican business summit on October 25, 2011.   In the brusque, but charming manner that characterizes the charismatic former Brazilian president, he declared for the third time in recent months that PEMEX and <mark>PETROBRAS</mark> should become partners and together create an energy company to explore new markets. <A name=""_ftnref6"" href=""#_ftn6"" id=""_ftnref6"">[6]</A>  Instead of a joint venture, both state owned companies should create a third company which could accept private investment for further energy exploitation. If the dream company, “Petróleos Mexicanos y Brasileiros S.A.” was to drill in areas outside Mexican sovereign territory, no change to the Constitution would be needed.  It might start by drilling off the West African coast, where <mark>PETROBRAS</mark> cut its teeth in 2001 with other national and multinational oil companies. <A name=""_ftnref7"" href=""#_ftn7"" id=""_ftnref7"">[7]</A> Overtime, <mark>PETROBRAS</mark> acquired the managerial and technical expertise in pre-salt deep waters to operate with greater efficiency and profitability.  It also attracted significant foreign investment, similar to the U.S. $224 billion which <mark>PETROBRAS</mark> expects to receive in the next three years.<A name=""_ftnref8"" href=""#_ftn8"" id=""_ftnref8"">[8]</A>  The potential for a “Petróleos Mexicanos y Brasileiros S.A.” also presents opportunities for international sovereign wealth investments.  Lula’s repeated message to Mexicans was to move away from reliance on the U.S market and expand business opportunities and markets in South America. </P><P>Lula offered his Mexican hosts a Brazilian partnership in a critical industry that has been frozen in nationalistic rhetoric and a monopolistic trade union.  A leader from a newly industrialized BRIC nation, not a traditional northern Atlantic leader, has proposed a solution.  Lula’s impact is to partially de-politicize the opening of Mexico’s oil industry.  </P><P>Significant challenges exist to opening Mexican energy to private investors.  Only the party of Lázaro Cardenas, the PRI, can break the nationalistic taboo and privatize PEMEX.  The forthcoming presidential campaign and the willingness of the PRI wanna-be candidate to discuss this subject gives hope that after 73 years, Mexican citizens might get a chance to modernize their energy source.  Only then, could Mexico regain its status as an energy giant. </P><DIV><DIV id=""ftn1""><P><A name=""_ftn1"" href=""#_ftnref1"" id=""_ftn1"">[1]</A> “Diferentes mecanismos podrían ser explorador para asegurar el involucramiento del sector privado en su alianza con Pemex… Brasil es un ejemplo”, dijo Peña Nieto.

Listen to MLex's bribery and corruption team discuss the implications for multinational companies that have been named in Brazilian prosecutors' documents.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><H4>22 August 2017. By <A href=""https://mlexmarketinsight.com/expertise/contributors/russo-rodrigo"">Rodrigo Russo</A> and <A href=""https://mlexmarketinsight.com/expertise/contributors/ben-lucas"">Ben Lucas</A>.</H4><P>Greek shipping companies Aegean Group and Tsakos Group have been dragged into the Brazilian corruption scandal involving the country's state-controlled oil company, Petróleo Brasileiro, or <mark>Petrobras</mark>.The companies are alleged to have paid middlemen, who in turn bribed <mark>Petrobras</mark> officials to help secure contracts for the shipping companies.The allegations are made in a recent court filing by the Federal Prosecutors Office from the state of Paraná as part of their investigation into corruption at <mark>Petrobras</mark>, known as Operation Lava Jato.Anglo-Swiss mining giant Glencore became has also been accused of paying bribes to <mark>Petrobras</mark> officials, as the authority's probe continues to expand.Tsakos and Aegean's interests were represented by father and son Konstantinos and Georgios Kotronakis when dealing with <mark>Petrobras</mark>.Konstantinos Kotronakis was also employed as a director by Tsakos's Brazilian Unit, Tsakos Brasil Companhia de Navegacao, and he was also employed as a managing partner at a Brazilian unit of Aegean, Aegean Bunkering (Brazil) Import and Exports of Petroleum and Derivatives.Georgios Kotronakis, a 28-year-old British National, was, and still is, owner and controller of UK company Seaview Shipping &amp; Trading, which at the time was known as GB Maritime, according to the UK's company registry.Prosecutors allege that former <mark>Petrobras</mark> executive Paulo Roberto Costa gave Konstantinos and Georgios Kotronakis inside information to help the Greek shipping companies they represented secure contracts. In return, Costa would receive a commission based on the value of the contracts, and part of the bribes that went to Costa were forwarded to politicians from the Progressive Party, which controlled indications for <mark>Petrobras</mark> Supply directorate. The Kotronakis duo also received kickbacks from the deals.So far prosecutors have evidence that at least five contracts, four with Tsakos and one with Aegean, were secured through corruption.Between May 2009 and April 2013 Tsakos companies agreed to 35 contracts with <mark>Petrobras</mark> worth some $790 million and between October 2009 and March 2013 Aegean entities participated in four contracts with <mark>Petrobras</mark> worth about $31 million.— The evidence —The corruption allegations are largely based on the testimony of Costa, who was the director of supply at <mark>Petrobras</mark> at the time.He gave these confessions as part of a leniency agreement with prosecutors in 2014. In return for his information and evidence, Costa had his 128-year jail sentence suspended and was released from prison.Another key piece of the evidence was found on a pen-drive that was apprehended from a former Eletronuclear official that contained details about the corrupt scheme.Prosecutors also obtained evidence of bank transfers to corroborate Costa's plea deal statements, which were obtained with the help of authorities in Switzerland and Luxembourg.Tsakos Energy Navigation paid $686,963.75 into the accounts of Seaview and GB Maritime. Diralmar Internacional, an authorized agent of the Tsakos group, also paid $1,678,575.47 into the accounts of both companies.Aegean Petroleum Marine, Aegean Shipping management and Aegean Bunkering Services, paid $2,646,842.34 to Seaview.  Prosecutors found that a total $966,807.41 had been transferred from GB Maritime and Seaview to a Swiss bank account of &quot;OST Invest&quot; and a Luxemburg account of &quot;BS Consulting,&quot; of which Costa and his son-in-law, Humberto Sampaio de Mesquita, were the beneficiaries.  Prosecutors also found that Konstantinos and Georgios Kotronakis visited <mark>Petrobras</mark>' headquarters roughly 17 times between November 2010 and January 2014.— Next steps —Prosecutors have filed for the arrests of Konstantinos Kotronakis, along with other individuals implicated in the allegations. They didn't request the arrest of his son Georgios.But Federal Judge Sergio Moro rejected prosecutor's request for an arrest warrant for Konstantinos Kotronakis, instead seizing his passport and ordering him not to leave the country.Moro rejected the request because Kotronakis was listed as an honorary consul of Greece in Brazil. This means he was not a Greek government employee, but was officially designated to advance Greek interests in the country.But it appears that Kotronakis has already left the country, as a letter from his lawyer dated Aug. 18 filed with the court shows that Kotronakis signed it in Greece.The judge, however, did grant search warrants of Aegean and Tsakos' Brazil offices, as well as the company and residential properties of the Kotronakis duo.The judge also imposed an asset freezing order on Aegean, Tsakos, and Seaview Brazilian assets worth up to 5 million reais. But the country's central bank could only find $981.204,51 (reais) in Tsakos' bank accounts, and $3.346.426,12 (reais) in Aegean's.Tsakos and Aegean were contacted by MLex but didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</P><SECTION class=""share-links""><DIV class=""title"">Share this </DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The Stop Deep Sea Oil Flotilla protested – and successfully disrupted – that work earlier this year.</P><P>Now the company is deciding whether or not to start drilling exploratory wells, as allowed by its permit.</P><P>The joint legal action is calling for a review of that permit on the basis that the Government:</P><UL><LI>failed to properly consider the environmental impact of <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ activities, as required by New Zealand’s obligations under customary international law, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS), and the Convention for the Protection of Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region 1986 (the South Pacific Convention);</LI><LI>failed to properly consider the potential effects on marine wildlife;</LI><LI>failed to factor in the requirements of the Treaty of Waitangi, which should have included consulting with te Whānau-ā-Apanui; and</LI><LI>failed to consider the iwi’s fishing rights and customary title claims to the area.</LI></UL><P>Whether the High Court in Wellington will agree remains to be seen; but … te Whānau-ā-Apanui most certainly don’t want drilling to go ahead, and there is no doubt that a major oil spill would have a devastating effect on the seabirds, dolphins, whales, and the other wildlife on much of the East Coast of the North Island, if such a spill was to occur.</P><P>It’s also plain that major spills do happen. The Deepwater Horizon (an exploratory rig like the one that <mark>Petrobras</mark> would bring to New Zealand) disaster in the Gulf of Mexico last year put paid to any notion that they don’t. Millions of barrels of oil had poured from BP’s well, before it was finally sealed, three months after the spill began. More than 6000 ships were part of the (unsuccessful) clean up operation – New Zealand couldn’t muster a fraction of that number. And while the Deepwater Horizon was operating in 1500 metres of water, parts of <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ permit area is 3000 metres deep: a diver can only descend as far as 200 metres to fix a problem on the seafloor; the risks are amplified as the water gets deeper.</P><P>Pushing into deeper and deeper water, in the world’s most unspoilt places, like the East Cape, and the Arctic, will only make <mark>climate change</mark> worse. What’s needed is the Government to give up its obsession with fossil fuels, and start putting the handouts it gives the likes of the deep water oil industry into seed funds that will enable this country’s clean energy sector to realise its enormous potential.</P><P>We’ll keep you posted on progress.</P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><SECTION class=""article-listing page-section""><SECTION class=""article-listing page-section""><DIV class=""container""><DIV class=""row""><HEADER class=""col-md-12 article-listing-intro""><DIV class=""col-md-7 col-lg-8 col-xl-9""><H3 class=""page-section-header"">Related Articles</H3></DIV></HEADER></DIV></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

Brazilian multinational corporation <EM><mark>Petrobras</mark></EM> has developed a technology for oil extraction from oil shale mining over several decades. <mark>Petrobras</mark> seeks not only to expand oil shale mining within Brazilian territory, but also has begun to export the Brazilian technology around the planet, often is teaming up with <EM>TOTAL</EM> of France in introducing giant industrial oil shale extracting mines-- becoming a thin wedge promoting the expansion of extreme extraction.</P><P><STRONG>The details:</STRONG></P><P>Brazil has been identified as having one of the largest oil shale reserves in the world. By far the largest deposits of oil shale in Brazil occur in the southern tip of the country, close to the borders with Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina.</P><P>Estimates are of 82 billion barrels of oil in place; no estimates made of recoverable reserves (Likely current figure around ten percent, or approximately 8 billion barrels).</P><P>Pyrolosis retorting after strip mining currently used; crushed kerogen-infused shale rock is put through a conveyor and kerogen is “bled” out through an intense heating process involving externally introduced gas.

It is also being sold in a currency that, by Canadian standards, is<EM> ‘on sale’</EM>, and the current National Oil Company (NOC) owner is in the process of divesting: <STRONG>Brazilian Pre-Salt.</STRONG></P><P><EM>Never heard of it?</EM> Neither had I until spending almost a week in Rio de Janeiro attending the <A href=""http://www.energycities.org/"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>World Energy Cities Partnership </STRONG></A>(WECP) annual general meeting (AGM) and subsequent meetings arranged by the Canadian Consulate in Rio. The WECP is a partnership of 22 energy cities from around the world who come together to understand opportunities for trade and investment between their markets. It is a tangible example of how Calgary Economic Development is leveraging the strength and international reach of the energy industry to foster economic growth, a vital tactic in the <A href=""economicstrategy"" target=""_blank"">10 year Economic Strategy for Calgary</A>. WECP partner cities are engaged in best practice sharing, including an emerging, more strategic focus on economic development, renewable energy and <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>Calgary, one of the founding WECP members, is now Co-Chair of the WECP Economic Development Committee and an active committee member on both the Finance and Communications Committees. With this deepening engagement, Calgary Economic Development intends to leverage Calgary’s ‘Global Energy’ through the WECP partnership for greater trade &amp; investment opportunities, as well as share knowledge from other jurisdictions with Calgary based companies. </P><P>While in Rio for the WECP AGM, I had the opportunity to hold several meetings with international business service companies who support businesses in and from around the world. These companies were specifically interested in discussions because of their linkages between the Energy Sector in Calgary (or Canada) and Brazil. Independently, each of these businesses told me that <STRONG>Canadian Energy and Energy Services companies are missing the boat</STRONG>. With <mark>Petrobras</mark>, Brazil’s embattled National Oil Company, in the early stages of divesting a variety of assets; deals and preparation are rampant in Brazil with companies from all over the world laying the groundwork for their stake in the next concession round. Except Canada – Canadian companies, specifically Calgary energy companies are conspicuously absent. The questions is, <EM>why</EM>?</P><H4 class=""blockquote"">If the word ‘<mark>Petrobras</mark>’ sends shivers down the spine of Canadian energy companies, it’s understandable.</H4><P><mark>Petrobras</mark> has been embroiled in perhaps one of the largest, most well publicized and ugly corruption scandals of recent memory. That said, it has forced <mark>Petrobras</mark> into a position where transparency and integrity are now among its key corporate goals.  It’s also now in a position where a monopoly on these assets is not seen by Brazil as a good, strategic position. </P><P><STRONG>Canadian companies should be looking at these opportunities;</STRONG> I was told in a variety of discussions. Canadian energy companies are <STRONG>entrepreneurial </STRONG>and <STRONG>innovative </STRONG>and have the technology and ‘can do’ attitude to successfully exploit opportunities in Brazil. A good number of the opportunities are in the new offshore, pre Salt play. When suggesting most of our expertise lies in onshore, I was told that <EM><STRONG>much of our expertise can be translated into the Pre Salt plan </STRONG></EM>AND there are also assets coming available in onshore Oil &amp; Gas as well as mining (Brazil mines for “everything but rubies”) which is our wheelhouse. I was also told, in very direct terms that <STRONG>“Canadian pipeline companies should be here”</STRONG>. And, while fracking regulation is currently on the drawing board in Brazil, Canada’s expertise is being drawn on to help regulators in Brazil finalize their own regulations which will lead to significant opportunities in unconventional, shale gas in Brazil. A play that is relatively early stage.</P><P>So which countries are currently active in Brazil and poised to enter into the upcoming bidding rounds for <mark>Petrobras</mark> assets? Japan, China, Norway, and Australia to name a few. <STRONG>Canadian companies have a significant opportunity in Brazil.</STRONG> But, I was told it’s important to have a market-specific plan and do our due diligence. There is on-the-ground support in both Calgary and Rio to help Canadian energy companies enter the market. <STRONG>This isn’t an opportunity reserved for the big, global players.  An international consulting firm with a significant presence in both Calgary and Rio told me that junior, servicing companies should be looking at these opportunities and vigorously pursuing them </STRONG>(with the right support of course). And they need to start now to be ready to maximize these opportunities to ensure they don’t get left behind.</P></DIV><DIV class=""comments"" id=""block-589""><DIV class=""container-fluid""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-sm-12""><H4>Discussion</H4></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

But while Brazil’s political future hangs in the balance, <mark>Petrobras</mark> – the state oil company at the center of Brazil’s largest corruption scandal – is also facing great uncertainty. The massive corruption scandal has shaken Brazil’s political establishment, contributed to its economic downturn and damaged its already troubled state energy giant and oil industry. Though it will take time to reverse these ills, momentous changes may be on the horizon for <mark>Petrobras</mark> and the entire energy sector.</P><P>The greatest challenge facing Brazil’s energy sector is its struggling national oil company which can no longer fulfill its critical role in Brazil’s economy. <mark>Petrobras</mark> is central to every aspect of the energy sector in Brazil –from oil exploration and production to refining, retail fuel sales and gas distribution – and has stakes across other industries like power generation, petrochemicals and ethanol.</P><P>But the company is weighed down by enormous debt, with about $130 billion in obligations – the result of massive investments based on what proved to be overly optimistic production targets. <mark>Petrobras</mark> has been hit by a combination of low oil prices and the devaluation of Brazil’s currency, the real, as 80% of the company’s debts are dollar-denominated, but much of its revenue comes from domestic fuel sales in reals.</P><P>Though oil production has been rising, growth has been much lower than projected. <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ domestic oil output has risen by only 300,000 barrels per day since the first discoveries of giant oil reserves in the deepwater pre-salt region were made nearly a decade ago. The company has revised down its production target to 2.7 million barrels per day by 2020 – far short of the more than 5 million barrels per day it projected for 2020 in its 2013 business plan.</P><P>Yet, <mark>Petrobras</mark> lacks a viable plan to improve its finances and a clear vision of its future. The company has a $15 billion divestment plan for this year but has made little progress on its asset sales, shedding only small assets like its Argentine unit. Management is hoping to sell non-core assets and non-controlling stakes, but given lower oil prices and Brazil’s precarious economic and political situation, investors are reluctant to take minority stakes in <mark>Petrobras</mark>-controlled companies and it has proved difficult to sell at attractive prices. As a result, the company may have to pull out of entire market segments, such as pipelines, power generation, logistics facilities, refineries and natural gas distribution — reshaping the midstream, downstream and natural gas businesses in Brazil. <mark>Petrobras</mark> has long played a critical role in ensuring fuel supplies and distribution for Brazil and if it pulls back, it is unclear who would fill this role, what the state company’s new role would be, and whether regulatory changes would be necessary.</P><P><mark>Petrobras</mark> also plans to cut capital expenditures but is nearing the threshold necessary to maintain current production and revenues. The company’s spending cuts have been enormous – in 2015, it cut planned spending in its five-year business plan by 37% compared to 2014. <mark>Petrobras</mark> has delayed the release of its 2016-2021 business plan until June, when it may announce further reductions.</P><P>Though <mark>Petrobras</mark> is shrinking, the many barriers to private investment in Brazil’s oil sector prevent the private sector from filling the void left by the state oil company. The country has few domestic oil companies, and international companies complain of onerous local content rules and permitting delays. Many local suppliers implicated in the corruption scandal are now in disarray, with some entering bankruptcy and executives in jail. A 2010 reform under former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva requires <mark>Petrobras</mark> to be the sole operator in all pre-salt fields with a minimum 30% stake, severely limiting private investment in those areas.</P><P>However, in the longer term, there may be new opportunities for private investment and important reforms to the sector. Opposition Senator Jose Serra has proposed legislation to reverse the pre-salt reform, recognizing that <mark>Petrobras</mark> lacks the financial and operational capacity to fill this role. The bill has already been approved by the Senate and now must be passed by the Chamber of Deputies and signed by the president.  Both interim President Michael Temer and Pedro Parente, his choice for the new CEO of <mark>Petrobras</mark>, support revising <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ mandatory participation in the pre-salt, and the pre-salt bill will likely be approved quickly by the Chamber of Deputies and signed into law. The lower house has named the bill as one of its top priorities for the legislative session and Temer’s party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), will want to send a signal that it is seeking to attract investment.</P><P>If the pre-salt bill is approved, there may soon be fresh opportunities for increased foreign investment and production. The government has discussed holding an auction to sell licenses to produce oil from areas adjacent to previously awarded pre-salt blocks where the reservoir extends beyond the licensed area. These extended reservoirs could hold billions of barrels of oil.  In addition, <mark>Petrobras</mark> is hoping to farm out some of its stakes in onshore fields and sell equity stakes in some mature fields to raise capital for enhanced oil recovery. Recently, the government extended <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ contracts for some older fields awarded in 1998, creating more incentive to invest in those areas.</P><P>Major changes to Brazil’s oil and gas sector in the near future seem all but inevitable. In the coming months and years, state oil giant <mark>Petrobras</mark> will likely shrink. Brazil’s oil production will still grow, but much more gradually than was projected in recent years, and <mark>Petrobras</mark> will become a leaner company focused primarily on its core business of oil and gas production. New spaces will open up for private investment from international companies and new local companies and Brazil’s energy sector will have to undergo important reforms. But the timeline for these changes largely depends on Brazil’s uncertain political future.</P><P><EM><STRONG>T</STRONG></EM><EM><STRONG>his article was also published in <A href=""http://energyfuse.org/beyond-political-crisis-future-brazils-energy-sector/"">The Fuse</A>.</STRONG></EM></P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN><FOOTER class=""siteFooter""><DIV class=""constrained""><DIV class=""footerGroup footerGroup1""><P>The Inter-American Dialogue engages our network of global leaders to foster democratic governance, prosperity, and social equity in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Therefore, it can’t strand assets.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">2) Even if such action could affect demand and prices, the effect is so far in the future investors can safely ignore or ‘discount’ it.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">At <mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker we don’t believe either of these to be true. In this article we address the issues raised by Helm and argue that that they risk leaving investors (and corporates) blind-sided by the risk action on <mark>climate change</mark> poses to shareholder value. We will attempt to respond to each of the specific concerns Helm’s report raises with the <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>tracker.org/refs-and-resources/terms-list/#stranded-assets"" title=""Stranded Assets"">stranded asset</A> hypothesis in turn:</P><OL style=""text-align: justify;""><LI><STRONG>“…the lack of a serious <mark>carbon</mark> price now [means] <mark>climate change</mark> … is more hot air than serious action.”</STRONG></LI></OL><P style=""text-align: justify;""><mark>Carbon</mark> pricing isn’t the only way <mark>climate change</mark> can be tackled. Action on the demand side via improved efficiency has been ongoing in most of the OECD for some time – rising fuel economy vehicle standards, rising fuel duties, mandated efficiencies (LED bulbs, condensing boilers etc.). This perhaps explains why OECD <mark>carbon</mark> emissions for 2014 were back to 1998’s level. Europe’s are back to 1970’s, hardly supportive of the comment that <mark>climate change</mark> is only “hot air”.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Efficiency is likely to play a key role going forward but fuel substitution will also be important as more and more regions implement ambitious renewable energy targets. For example, <mark>climate change</mark> legislation passed in California requires 50 per cent of the state’s electricity to come from renewable energy sources by 2030. The EU’s 2030 <mark>climate</mark> &amp; energy framework sets a binding target to boost the share of renewables to at least 27 per cent of EU energy consumption by 2030. Action by governments, both co-ordinated and country-based, is likely to include efficiency mandates and continued fuel substitution, especially renewables. Fossil fuel demand in the OECD has fallen by five per cent over the past decade: EU demand has fallen by 18 per cent, equivalent to two per cent annually suggesting that the IEA’s 450 scenario is not “hot air.”</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Any industry seeing falling demand for its products, however caused, faces potential trouble. A very good example of how assets can be stranded even in the absence of <mark>carbon</mark> pricing is the European refining industry. Since the late 1990s, gasoline demand has been trending down at around 2.5 per cent annually. This was the result of high taxation at the pump and efficiency mandates (including switching to diesel). Over that period, 11 European refineries closed and a <A href=""http://abarrelfull.wikidot.com/refineries-that-are-closed-down"">further three were mothballed</A> with only the slightest hint of a <mark>carbon</mark> price.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">A more recent example of how action on <mark>climate change</mark> can affect valuations is the European power industry. Increasing renewable energy deployment has been linked to the loss of over half the market capitalisation (<A href=""http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21587782-europes-electricity-providers-face-existential-threat-how-lose-half-trillion-euros"">over €500bn</A>) of the top 20 energy utilities in Europe from peak value in 2008 to October 2013.</P><OL style=""text-align: justify;"" start=""2""><LI><STRONG>“The stranded asset argument in its simple form is all about quantities, and silent on price.”</STRONG></LI></OL><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Just because the “simple” form of stranding is quiet on price doesn’t mean all forms are. From a top-down perspective, the simple form does focus on volumes because it aims to assess the volume of reserves (and resources) that are not needed in the context of a 2C <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>tracker.org/refs-and-resources/terms-list/#<mark>carbon</mark>-budgets"" title=""<mark>Carbon</mark> Budgets""><mark>carbon</mark> budget</A>. But it is not true that all those interested in stranded assets look solely at volume, especially those interested in investments. For example, <mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker uses <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>tracker.org/refs-and-resources/terms-list/#<mark>carbon</mark>-budgets"" title=""<mark>Carbon</mark> Budgets""><mark>carbon</mark> budgets</A> together with cost curves to identify high-cost projects that would be unnecessary in a 450-style demand scenario. It is these projects that would be at risk of destroying shareholder value.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker called these projects “financially stranded” as they risk failing to earn a return above a company’s cost of capital. Price is a key metric in this analysis. Projects with breakeven prices above the marginal cost of supply needed to meet a 450 scenario risk destroying shareholder value. This concept is highly relevant to investors and corporates as it provides an early warning signal of full blown stranding. Investors in those closed and mothballed European refineries might have welcomed a study that showed that proposed efficiency measures would mean supply (refining capacity) was set to exceed demand. They would have been able to bail out well before the assets had to be written off.</P><OL style=""text-align: justify;"" start=""3""><LI><STRONG>“…the threat of price changes has very little to do with <mark>climate change</mark> in the short to medium term”</STRONG></LI></OL><P style=""text-align: justify;"">This is a risky assertion but the paper’s conclusion relies on the concept that <mark>climate change</mark> cannot affect prices and so cannot strand assets. Most economists would accept that in a perfect world, prices are determined by the relationship between supply and demand. Falling demand tends to cause falling prices. Claiming that <mark>climate change</mark> measures can’t affect prices in the short-to-medium term is therefore risky – as those European refinery owners would probably agree.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">The history of the oil market shows that even small changes in the supply demand balance can cause very large movements in oil prices. For example, the collapse in Brent from $120 in 2014 to under $35 today was caused by a two per cent move in the supply demand balance caused by Saudi Arabia putting an additional 2mb/d on to the market. That was not caused by “<mark>climate change</mark>”. However, it is certainly possible that moves to address <mark>climate change</mark> could cause a similar change in future. Mandated efficiency measures, gas substitution and increased duty on fuel helped European Union oil demand (gasoline, diesel and heavy fuel oil) fall by one per cent annually over the past two decades. This might seem modest but is slightly shy of the long term trend for global oil demand under the IEA’s 450 scenario.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">A similar demand scenario has already played out in the US coal market over the past five years. Substitution combined with tightening emission standards has seen US coal demand fall by around two per cent annually. Over that five years, the US quoted coal index has fallen by over a third in absolute terms and by nearly two-thirds relative to the S&amp;P 500 index. With China taking action on coal owing to air <mark>pollution</mark>, it is likely that thermal coal is in structural decline with seaborne prices remaining depressed due to oversupply. A potential lesson from history for the oil industry perhaps?</P><OL style=""text-align: justify;"" start=""4""><LI><STRONG>“… until recently, <mark>climate</mark> campaigners [argued] that these prices will go ever higher as peak oil (and peak gas) kick in.”</STRONG></LI></OL><P style=""text-align: justify;"">And</P><OL style=""text-align: justify;"" start=""5""><LI><STRONG>“Now note the implications. If this were true and prices were going ever upwards, the assets on the balance sheets of the oil and gas companies would be ever more valuable.”</STRONG></LI></OL><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Not all “activists” believe in ever-higher prices. <A href=""http://<mark>carbon</mark>tracker.wpengine.com/report/<mark>carbon</mark>-supply-cost-curves-evaluating-financial-risk-to-oil-capital-expenditures/""><mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker’s report in May 2014</A> – when the oil price was still $100 plus – described a transition scenario that would deliver Brent prices in the $75 area. Recent research from UCL (<A href=""http://energieclimat.hypotheses.org/23910"">January 2015</A>) showed that there is sufficient oil to meet demand well beyond 2050 (even under the IEA’s current policies scenario) at prices under $70. Neither constitutes an “ever higher” price scenario in our view. An assertion that might have more validity is that “activists” see ever-rising costs rather than prices. Assuming an efficient world, rising costs would imply rising prices as projects would be developed in order of cost. But this does not result in rising margins. And margin is a far more important driver of value than price is.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Sadly, the oil market is far from efficient because of the presence of OPEC. The world has spent much of the past 40 years developing high cost non-OPEC oil whilst leaving most of OPEC’s low cost oil in the ground. It may be that the current low level of oil prices will not endure. But what is far clearer is that the $100 plus world that formed the basis of oil industry planning over the five years running up to 2014 was far from <mark>sustainable</mark>. It assumed that OPEC, Saudi Arabia especially, was willing to lose market share in order to support prices. Events of 2014 suggest that willingness is not written in stone. The oil industry should have cast an eye over the events that led to the 1985/86 oil price crash – similar in magnitude to that of 2014. They would have seen identical behaviour by Saudi Arabia.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Philosopher <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_of_Reason"">George Santayana’s quote</A>, “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”, seems appropriate.</P><OL style=""text-align: justify;"" start=""6""><LI><STRONG>“The implications of discounting are obvious and profound: at any reasonable number, investors are not much interested in returns in even 10 years’ time, let alone in 2050”.</STRONG></LI></OL><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Analysts taking the top-down approach to stranded assets don’t need to invoke discount rates as they are interested in the volumes at risk of becoming stranded not value at risk. But there are many reports that analyse the financial risk. <mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker has looked at the financial risk for all three fossil fuels. And Goldman Sachs and Sanford Bernstein have issued similar reports looking at market risks. These reports all use discount rates – and they used discount rates close to the industry’s cost of capital (10-15 per cent). It is true that some observers have called for relatively low discount rates to illuminate the costs that future generations will have to fund in order to repair the damage caused by <mark>climate change</mark>. But the studies that focus on investment risk – such as CTI’s – are very much aligned with the metrics used by the financial and energy industries.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">But there is also a flaw in the report’s claim that discount rates mean investors are not interested in returns “in even 10 years’ time”. Of course, it is obvious that an investor will be more interested in $100 today rather than $100 in 10 years’ time. After all, the $100 in 2025 is only worth less than $40 in terms of today’s money, assuming a 10 per cent discount rate. But the report’s argument relies on a static view of a company – it assumes today’s $100 is not reinvested but returned to investors. But oil companies do re-invest and most of them re-invest far more than they return to shareholders (In 2014, ExxonMobil’s capital expenditure was around 60 per cent higher than its shareholder distributions). Oil companies invest because it adds value – as long as returns beat their cost of capital. So, for example, investing today’s $100 at a 15 per cent IRR (internal rate of return) would deliver value of around $155 in 10 years’ time (in today’s money). So $100 invested for 10 years is far more valuable than $100 in the pocket.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">It is obvious that the effect of discounting does not mean investors should not be interested in events a decade ahead. As long as the oil industry keeps investing, they should be very interested in the cash flows that will result from today’s investment.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">One reason for this is that the oil industry’s best laid plans often go awry. Cost overruns, project delays, fiscal changes, and unanticipated changes in commodity prices are common occurrences. Indeed, many of the projects sanctioned for development by oil companies in 2013 are unlikely to deliver the returns the industry originally projected due to the fall in the oil price. We suspect many will now destroy value unless oil prices recover. If, for example, our “15 per cent” project delivered only five per cent, the $100 invested today would be turned in to $60, not $155. Such financial risks are another very good reason to keep a very close eye on cash flows 10 years hence.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Of course, if companies chose to move to a ‘harvest’ strategy rather than reinvesting, Dieter Helm’s conclusion that investors have little interest in “10 years’ time” is valid. An oil company in harvest mode has less to fear from the effect of <mark>climate change</mark> as it is not rolling the risk forward by re-investing. The same is true for its shareholders as the dividends would have already been safely banked.</P><OL style=""text-align: justify;"" start=""7""><LI><STRONG>“More than 90% of oil reserves are in state not private hands.” (So it’s not a problem for quoted oil anyway)</STRONG></LI></OL><P style=""text-align: justify;"">There are two problems with this statement. First, many so-called private companies are partially quoted – including <mark>Petrobras</mark>, Statoil, many Chinese producers and most Russian producers – so the quoted universe is much larger than the 10 per cent cited. Second, quoted companies make up a far greater percentage of potential production over the next 20 years. Most quoted oil companies have proven reserve lives of 10-15 years whereas OPEC’s are in excess of 50 years.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker estimates that the major oil companies and quoted Exploration &amp; Production companies will make up around 30 per cent of production over the next 20 years leaving them more exposed to <mark>climate change</mark> than the 10 per cent reserve comment implies. Another key issue highlighted by <A href=""http://<mark>carbon</mark>tracker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CTI-Oil-Report-Oil-May-2014-13-05.pdf""><mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker in its 2014 report</A> was that private companies’ production is on average far higher cost than that of state oil companies. Another is that much of the high cost production likely to start in the next 20 years is in private hands. Around 70 per cent of production in state hands had break-even prices below $60: for private companies, the comparable figure was a little under 40 per cent. This means that private companies have more operational gearing to oil prices and so have more to lose should the oil market follow the coal industry.</P><OL style=""text-align: justify;"" start=""8""><LI><STRONG>“If nevertheless demand for oil slowly dries up as the <mark>carbon</mark> constraint bites, then these countries [State controlled companies] will conclude that oil today is worth more than oil tomorrow. They will then have every incentive to pump more and faster.”</STRONG></LI></OL><P style=""text-align: justify;"">So the paper accepts that it is possible that <mark>carbon</mark> constraints could cause lower demand possibly leading to the big reserve holders initiating a price war to protect market share. The emergence of such a price war – similar to that initiated by Saudi Arabia in 2014 and 1985/86 – is probably one of the greatest threats facing quoted oil. This is because if demand is under pressure from action on <mark>climate change</mark>, it implies a growing mismatch – rising supply and falling demand which would likely force prices lower. In extremis, prices would be pushed back to cash operating costs which could be even lower than spot prices today.</P><OL style=""text-align: justify;"" start=""9""><LI><STRONG>“…investors will find it more profitable to concentrate on the price of oil, and they can profitably ignore the stranded asset argument.”</STRONG></LI></OL><P style=""text-align: justify;"">The price of oil is an important driver of shareholder value and certainly should be concentrated on – although margin is probably more important. But that does not mean the risk of stranded assets should be ignored. Time and time again, the commodity market has shown that falling (or lower than expected) demand can cause price pressure. Such pressure can financially strand assets remarkably quickly. We could invoke the fate of Europe’s refineries again but the collapse in the US coal sector due to weak demand is a more recent and more financially painful example.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Anticipating how demand might change in response to future action on <mark>climate change</mark> might well give early warning of price trouble ahead, potentially leading to financial stranding. Ignoring stranding on the grounds that <mark>climate policy</mark> can’t affect price and hence can’t strand assets seems a rather blinkered view. In any case, stranded assets are normally the result of weak pricing so arguing that one should ignore stranding and focus on prices is disconnected thinking. One is a function of the other.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">More importantly, worrying about stranding gives you an indication of the scale of the potential risk that weak pricing could pose to your portfolio. Investors should continuously be looking for the early signs of “financial stranding”, the definition <mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker uses. Dieter Helm is correct that prices (or more importantly margins) are important but it is demand that sets prices. Investors need to monitor issues – such as action on <mark>climate</mark> – that can change the demand outlook. Assuming stranding is irrelevant because it can’t occur except in the long term is dangerous. It risks investors ending up in the same position as the last shareholders in Kodak, Polaroid, Peabody Coal and various Canadian oil sand producers.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Interestingly, Kodak re-emerged from bankruptcy in 2012 and is manufacturing specialist film. Peabody and many Canadian oil sand producers are still operating, so technically they are not stranded under Dieter Helm’s narrow definition. But we doubt that is of much comfort to their shareholders or bond holders.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><EM>Paul Spedding is an advisor to <A href=""http://<mark>carbon</mark>tracker.wpengine.com/""><mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker</A> and an ex-HSBC head of oil &amp; gas</EM></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">This article was first published in <A href=""http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/opinion/2441894/stranded-assets-a-response-myth-or-reality"">Business Green</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><SECTION class=""newsletter-section section-padding""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""large-8 tablet-10 tablet-centered columns""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""small-6 columns newsletter-section-widget widget widget_text""><H1 class=""newsletter-section__title heading-3"">Never miss a word with updates directly to your inbox</H1><DIV class=""textwidget""><P>Keep up to date with the latest news and reports as they are released.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""small-6 columns newsletter-section-widget widget widget_mc4wp_form_widget""><FORM id=""mc4wp-form-1"" class=""mc4wp-form mc4wp-form-528"" method=""post"" data-id=""528"" data-name=""Main Form""><DIV class=""mc4wp-form-fields""><P class=""footer-newsletter-section__desc"">

A cleaner and more diversified energy mix in China is another major driver of this transformation.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">       O ressurgimento na produção de petróleo e gás dos Estados Unidos, a redução profunda no custo das energias renováveis ​​e a crescente eletrificação estão mudando a cara do sistema energético global e levantando as formas tradicionais de atender à demanda de energia, de acordo com o Panorama de Energia Mundial 2017. Uma combinação de energia mais limpa e diversificada na China é outro importante impulsionador dessa transformação.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">          Over the next 25 years, the world’s growing energy needs are met first by renewables and natural gas, as fast-declining costs turn solar power into the cheapest source of new electricity generation. Global energy demand is 30% higher by 2040 — but still half as much as it would have been without efficiency improvements. The boom years for coal are over — in the absence of large-scale <mark>carbon</mark> capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) — and rising oil demand slows down but is not reversed before 2040 even as electric-car sales rise steeply.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">           Nos próximos 25 anos, as necessidades energéticas mundiais crescentes são atendidas primeiro por energias renováveis ​​e gás natural, já que os custos em declínio rápido tornam a energia solar a fonte mais barata de geração de eletricidade nova. A demanda global de energia é 30% maior em 2040 – mas ainda metade do que teria sido sem melhorias de eficiência. Os anos de auge para o carvão acabaram – na ausência de captura, utilização e armazenamento de <mark>carbon</mark>o em grange escala (CCUS) – e a crescente procura de petróleo diminui, mas não é revertida antes de 2040, mesmo quando as vendas de carros elétricos aumentam abruptamente.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">          WEO-2017, the International Energy Agency (IEA)’s flagship publication, finds that over the next two decades the global energy system is being reshaped by four major forces: the United States is set to become the undisputed global oil and gas leader; renewables are being deployed rapidly thanks to falling costs; the share of electricity in the energy mix is growing; and China’s new economic strategy takes it on a cleaner growth mode, with implications for global energy markets.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">         WEO-2017, a publicação principal da Agência Internacional de Energia (AIE), considera que, nas próximas duas décadas, o sistema energético global está sendo reformulado por quatro forças principais: os Estados Unidos devem se tornar o líder mundial incontestável de petróleo e gás; as energias renováveis ​​estão sendo implantadas rapidamente graças à queda de custos; a participação da eletricidade na combinação de energia está crescendo; e a nova estratégia econômica da China leva a um modo de crescimento mais limpo, com implicações para os mercados globais de energia.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">          Solar PV is set to lead capacity additions, pushed by deployment in China and India, meanwhile in the European Union, wind becomes the leading source of electricity soon after 2030.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">          O PV solar está configurado para liderar as adições de capacidade, promovido pela implantação na China e na Índia, enquanto isso na União Européia, o vento se torna a principal fonte de eletricidade logo após 2030.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">          “Solar is forging ahead in global power markets as it becomes the cheapest source of electricity generation in many places, including China and India,” said Dr Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director. “Electric vehicles (EVs) are in the fast lane as a result of government support and declining battery costs but it is far too early to write the obituary of oil, as growth for trucks, petrochemicals, shipping and aviation keep pushing demand higher. The US becomes the undisputed leader for oil and gas production for decades, which represents a major upheaval for international market dynamics.”</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">           “A energia Solar está avançando nos mercados de energia globais, uma vez que se torna a fonte mais econômica de geração de eletricidade em muitos lugares, incluindo China e Índia”, disse o Dr. Fatih Birol, diretor executivo da AIE. “Os veículos elétricos (EVs) estão na faixa rápida como resultado do apoio do governo e da queda dos custos da bateria, mas é muito cedo para registrar o obituário do petróleo, já que o crescimento de caminhões, petroquímicos, transporte e aviação continuam impulsionando a demanda. Os EUA se tornam o líder incontestável da produção de petróleo e gás por décadas, o que representa uma grande perturbação para a dinâmica do mercado internacional “.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">          These themes — as well as the future role of oil and gas in the energy mix, how clean-energy technologies are deploying, and the need for more investment in CCUS — were among the key topics discussed by the world’s energy leaders at the IEA’s 2017 Ministerial Meeting in Paris last week.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">          Esses temas – assim como o papel futuro do petróleo e do gás na combinação de energia, como as tecnologias de energia limpa estão sendo implantadas e a necessidade de mais investimentos na CCUS – foram alguns dos principais tópicos discutidos pelos líderes mundiais de energia na Reunião Ministerial 2017 da IEA, em Paris na semana passada.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">          This year, WEO-2017 includes a special focus on China, where economic and energy policy changes underway will have a profound impact on the country’s energy mix, and continue to shape global trends. A new phase in the country’s development results in an economy that is less reliant on heavy industry and coal.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">          Este ano, o WEO-2017 inclui um foco especial na China, onde as mudanças nas políticas econômicas e energéticas em curso terão um impacto profundo na combinação energética do país e continuarão a moldar as tendências globais. Uma nova fase no desenvolvimento do país resulta em uma economia menos dependente da indústria pesada e do carvão.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">          At the same time, a strong emphasis on cleaner energy technologies, in large part to address poor air quality, is catapulting China to a position as a world leader in wind, solar, nuclear and electric vehicles and the source of more than a quarter of projected growth in natural gas consumption. As demand growth in China slows, other countries continue to push overall global demand higher – with India accounting for almost one-third of global growth to 2040.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">         Ao mesmo tempo, uma forte ênfase nas tecnologias de energia mais limpas, em grande parte para enfrentar a má qualidade do ar, está impulsionando a China a ocupar uma posição como líder mundial em veículos eólicos, solares, nucleares e elétricos e a fonte de mais de um quarto de crescimento planejado no consumo de gás natural. À medida que o crescimento da demanda na China diminui, outros países continuam aumentando a demanda global – com a Índia sendo a responsável por quase um terço do crescimento global até 2040.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">          The shale oil and gas revolution in the United States continues thanks to the remarkable ability of producers to unlock new resources in a cost-effective way. By the mid-2020s, the United States is projected to become the world’s largest LNG exporter and a net oil exporter by the end of that decade.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">          A revolução do petróleo de xisto e gás nos Estados Unidos continua graças à notável habilidade dos produtores de liberar novos recursos de forma rentável. Em meados da década de 2020, os Estados Unidos está projetado para se tornar o maior exportador de GNL do mundo e um exportador de petróleo líquido até o final dessa década.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">         This is having a major impact on oil and gas markets, challenging incumbent suppliers and provoking a major reorientation of global trade flows, with consumers in Asia accounting for more than 70% of global oil and gas imports by 2040. LNG from the United States is also accelerating a major structural shift towards a more flexible and globalized gas market.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">          Isso está tendo um grande impacto nos mercados de petróleo e gás, desafiando os fornecedores em exercício e provocando uma grande reorientação dos fluxos de comércio global, com consumidores na Ásia representando mais de 70% das importações mundiais de petróleo e gás até 2040. O GNL dos Estados Unidos está acelerando também uma grande mudança estrutural para um mercado de gás mais flexível e globalizado.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">        WEO-2017 finds it is too early to write the obituary of oil. Global oil demand continues to grow to 2040, although at a steadily decreasing pace – while fuel efficiency and rising electrification bring a peak in oil used for passenger cars, even with a doubling of the car fleet to two billion. But other sectors – namely petrochemicals, trucks, aviation, and shipping – drive up oil demand to 105 million barrels a day by 2040.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">         A WEO-2017 considera que é muito cedo para registrar o obituário do petróleo. A demanda mundial de petróleo continua a crescendo até 2040, embora a um ritmo constantemente menor – enquanto a eficiência de combustível e a eletrificação crescente trazem um pico no petróleo usado para automóveis de passageiros, mesmo com uma duplicação da frota de carros para dois bilhões. Mas outros setores – isto é, petroquímicos, caminhões, aviação e transporte – elevam a demanda de petróleo para 105 milhões de barris por dia até 2040.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">           While <mark>carbon</mark> emissions have flattened in recente years, the report finds that global energy-related <mark>CO2</mark> emissions increase slightly by 2040, but at a slower pace than in last year’s projections. Still, this is far from enough to avoid severe impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P style=""text-align: justify"">          Embora as emissões de <mark>carbon</mark>o tenham estagnado nos últimos anos, o relatório conclui que as emissões globais de <mark>CO2</mark> relacionadas com a energia aumentam ligeiramente em 2040, mas a um ritmo mais lento do que nas projeções do ano passado.

Demand for electricity has been growing faster than production and the country’s economy, a trend expected to continue. The government has recognised the need for a new energy strategy, and emissions from coal are expected to increase due to the country's plans to install 6000MW of coal-fuelled power by 2030 (representing 2.7% of the national grid compared to 83% from renewables).</P><P>Brazil is the main exporter of several agricultural products – for example, coffee, tobacco and corn.

As a UNFCCC non-Annex I member, Brazil can access the Clean Development Mechanism.</P><P>Brazil’s GHG reduction targets announced before the UN’s COP15 meeting in 2009 – see above – led from a National Policy on <mark>Climate Change</mark> from the same year. The law behind the policy also included the Second Brazilian Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions by Sources and Removals by Sinks of Greenhouse Gases not Controlled by the Montreal Protocol, a key part of Brazil's emissions monitoring and reporting.</P><P>In order to meet its targets, the country has set up initiatives in sectors such as agriculture and energy. The country has also set ambitious goals for reducing emissions from deforestation – the country's main source of GHG emissions.</P><P>Within the energy sector, Brazil is focusing on energy efficiency and the use of alternative sources of energy. Several programmes are under way to move towards lower emissions sources, such as natural gas. Since 1984, nuclear power has generated 152TWh of electricity. Renewable energy is expected to become a more significant source of energy, including 'modern' biomass, small hydro-electric plants, wind energy, solar energy, tidal power, and geothermal power. Other measures include integrating agricultural systems and an increase in energy supply from hydroelectric.

Cleaner shipping fuels could prevent many emissions-related deaths
</DIV></A></ASIDE><P>Johan Andresen, chair of the fund’s publicly appointed Council on Ethics, said the watchdog would look at more firms in the energy, steel and concrete industries and add more sectors, including shipping and power producers.</P><P>Speaking in an interview ahead of publication of the council’s annual report on Thursday, he said: “I expect there will be more companies recommended for exclusions based on the <mark>climate</mark> criteria.”</P><P>“Shipping and power producers are among the sectors we may be looking at.”</P><P>The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund was created from the proceeds of Norway’s oil industry and operates under ethical guidelines set by parliament.</P><P>It owns shares in 9,100 companies, 1.4 per cent of the world’s listed equity, so its decisions to drop or reinstate companies from its investments carry considerable weight among investors.</P><P>Mr Andresen said a company that is a big emitter of <mark>climate</mark> gases must show what plans it has to cut emissions by 2030 to remain in the fund’s portfolio, revealing for the first time what factors the watchdog takes into account.</P><P>“If they are very big emitters of greenhouse gas on an aggregate level and they are ‘worst in class’, they will really have to move,” said the 56-year-old Norwegian, who also owns private investment vehicle Ferd.</P><P>“They will need to have very credible plans to reduce emissions, that they have said they are going to do, not only to us, but to their shareholders.”</P><P>The fund itself has proposed dropping oil and gas stocks from its benchmark index which, if accepted, would mean the fund would cut stakes in oil and gas companies over time.</P><P>The proposal is currently under review at Norway’s finance ministry and will be voted on by parliament at a later date. Even if it goes ahead, the ethics watchdog will still have plenty of high polluters to examine.</P><P>“It would reduce the number of suspects we are looking at, but I don’t think we will be out of work,” said Mr Andresen. He declined to name specific companies.</P><P><STRONG>CORRUPTION WATCH LIST</STRONG></P><P>The fund has also been looking at blacklisting companies because of corruption risks. One is Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro which is on a watch list for possible exclusion in the future if the ethics watchdog deems there is a risk of corruption.</P><P>In January, state-controlled <mark>Petrobras</mark> agreed to pay $2.95bn to settle a US class action corruption lawsuit.</P><P>The fund held a 0.68 per cent stake in <mark>Petrobras</mark> worth $436m at end-2017, according to fund data.</P><P>Andresen said that while there were parts of <mark>Petrobras</mark> that were trying to change their practice to a more <mark>sustainable</mark> one, an “inherent challenge” was the practice of changing <mark>Petrobras</mark>’ board members whenever a new government came to power.</P><P>“It is going to take some time for state-controlled companies to understand that they must adhere to these compliance practices which minority shareholders, or other shareholders, expect and which is the basis for which they are listed,” he said.</P><P>The watchdog has an ongoing evaluation under the watch list scheme, he said. “We will just have to decide what kind of risk that entails and whether it makes it (<mark>Petrobras</mark>) more or less likely to be engaged in gross corruption in the future.”</P><P><STRONG>HUMAN RIGHTS</STRONG></P><P>The fund’s ethics procedure was launched at the start of the millennium and 73 companies are presently excluded on recommendations by the Council on Ethics, on various grounds.</P><P>Another 69 companies are excluded directly by the central bank based on their dependence on thermal coal.</P><P>The fund gradually sells shares in any company it wishes to drop, before any announcement is made. The main aim is to remove the ethical risk.</P><P>The fund is forbidden by law from investing in companies that produce nuclear weapons or landmines, or are involved in human rights violations, among other criteria.</P><P>This year, Mr Andresen said the ethics panel would definitely make a recommendation for exclusion due to the risk of corruption and was working actively on recommending exclusions regarding human rights violations in the textile industry in Asia.</P><P>He also anticipated there could be more recommendations against shipping companies for the practice of “beaching” — running old vessels aground to be picked apart by manual labour.

Although the Rio de Janeiro company is is the largest multinational in South America and generates over $141.2 billion in revenues a year, it is also the <A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-17/<mark>petrobras</mark>-told-to-cut-debt-before-8-5-billion-bond-sale.html"" target=""_blank"">world's most indebted oil company with $114 billion in outstanding obligations</A>.Brazilian federal authorities arrested Costa on March 20 following a money laundering investigation named &quot;Operation Car Wash.&quot; In the hope of receiving a lighter sentence, Costa named over 60 politicians whom he says were recipients of <mark>Petrobras</mark> money between 2002 and 2012.Last week, O Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper, and Veja, a weekly magazine, <A href=""http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/brasil/exclusivo-paulo-roberto-costa-comeca-a-revelar-os-nomes-dos-beneficiarios-do-megaesquema-de-corrupcao-da-<mark>petrobras</mark>"" target=""_blank"">published the names of the politicians</A>. They included Edison LobÃ£o; the minister for energy and mines; Renan Calheiros, the Senate president; Henrique Eduardo Alves; president of the lower house of Congress; and Eduardo Campos, a former governor.The scandal has threatened to undermine Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's re-election chances when the country goes to the polls on October 5. &quot;I assure you I will take the necessary action,&quot; Roussef told reporters.&quot; But I will not act based on speculation, I want the details.&quot;&quot;<A href=""http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/09/07/uk-brazil-election-<mark>petrobras</mark>-idUKKBN0H20QL20140907"" target=""_blank""><mark>Petrobras</mark> is being destroyed through political interference, patronage and corruption</A>,&quot; opposition candidate Marina Silva told the media. Silva, who worked closely with Campos, remains untainted by the scandal and is now tipped to win the election, in some part because Campos was killed in a plane accident last month.The scandal has pitted <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/world/americas/challenger-marina-silva-upends-brazilian-race-for-presidency-against-dilma-rousseff.html"" target=""_blank"">the two women - who both have claims to radical political backgrounds</A> - against each other. Silva is a committed environmentalist while Roussef - a former urban guerilla who was arrested and tortured by a previous military dictatorship - calls herself a &quot;developmentalist&quot; promoting policies to exploit Brazil's vast natural resources.This is not the first time this year that Roussef has come under fire over <mark>Petrobras</mark>. In March O. Estado de S. Paulo revealed that <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/11/us-<mark>petrobras</mark>-refinery-analysis-idUSBREA3A0RY20140411"" target=""_blank"">Roussef has personally championed a 2006 deal, under which <mark>Petrobras</mark> paid $1.2 billion to buy Pasadena Refining Systems Inc.</A> in Texas. This was despite the fact that the same facility had been purchased by a Transcor Astra Group SA, Belgian commodities trader, for just $42 5 million in 2005.For her part Roussef blamed Nestor CerverÃ³, a <mark>Petrobras</mark> executive whom she says wrote a flawed report on the refinery. It appears that <A href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303802104579449783792397504"" target=""_blank"">Astra took advantage of a special clause in the contract that forced the Brazilian company to pay more</A> than it had expected. The two went to arbitration in the U.S. but <mark>Petrobras</mark> lost, and was forced to pay an even higher bill.The company is attempting to stay out of the political brouhaha by deflecting blame on to its employees.&quot;It is in the<A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-08/<mark>petrobras</mark>-seeking-access-to-former-executive-s-testimony.html"" target=""_blank""> best interests of the company's management to see the completion of all ongoing investigations</A>,&quot; <mark>Petrobras</mark> said in a statement released to the media. &quot;Any irregular acts that may have been committed by a person or group of people, whether or not they are company employees, do not represent the conduct of the <mark>Petrobras</mark> institution and its workforce.&quot;But <mark>Petrobras</mark> has been caught in a bribery scandals before. In 2008, <A href=""/article.php?id=15110"" target=""_blank"">company executives were accused of accepting almost a million dollars from Alstom,</A> a French engineering group. The money was allegedly funelled from an Alstom subsidiary in Switzerland to an account in Uruguay in 2002 in order to win a contract to supply turbines worth $550 million dollars at the time.</P><DIV class=""amp amp-pri-tag""><SPAN class=""amp-pri-tag-label"">AMP Section Name:</SPAN><SPAN class=""amp-pri-tag-value"">Energy</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Recent market-oriented energy reforms in countries like Brazil and Mexico have increased investment pledges, but the region is still seeing an overall oil production decline.</P><P>The upcoming presidential elections could be decisive in advancing policies to maintain oil revenues. However, in the current <mark>climate</mark> of growing polarization and deeply unpopular incumbents in Latin America, the elections are generating tremendous political uncertainty. Several left-leaning candidates are against current oil policy but not for the same reasons. Some oppose investor-friendly policies based on oil nationalism; others contest the exploitation of energy resources on environmental grounds.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>2018 will be a pivotal year for energy in Latin America, as the region’s top oil producers are set to hold presidential elections that could lead to sweeping policy changes.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>In Mexico, independent candidates are allowed to run for the first time in the July presidential election, opening the way for a broad field of contenders. The front-runner, leftist nationalist Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), has made opposition to Mexico’s 2013 energy reform a cornerstone of his campaign. President Enrique Peña Nieto of the PRI party, who led the reform, is hugely unpopular. The business-friendly PAN party, which provided the critical votes to pass the reform in congress, is divided. Polls show AMLO with over 30 percentof votes, a sizable lead over the PRI and PAN candidates who are polling at about 17% each. Mexico has no second round of elections, so a candidate can win with a relatively small percentage of votes.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>The energy reform eliminated Pemex’s decades-long monopoly on oil production, and dozens of private companies have since won contracts in bid rounds that will bring an estimated $59 billion in investment.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The energy reform eliminated Pemex’s decades-long monopoly on oil production, and dozens of private companies have since won contracts in bid rounds that will bring an estimated $59 billion in investment. But this is only a fraction of the capital needed to return to Mexico’s 2004 peak oil production of 3.4 million barrels per day (mbd) compared to 2 mbd today. The government’s best-case projections see production rising only in 2019, meaning Mexicans will cast their vote before the reform starts to bear fruit.</P><P>AMLO has seized on weak oil production as proof that the sector’s opening is not delivering as promised and pledged to hold a public referendum to overturn the reform. Only a two-thirds congressional majority – which AMLO is unlikely to secure – can undo the constitutional reform, and it would be legally difficult to change existing contracts. And, despite his provocative stance, AMLO could choose to support private investment once in office in a bid to generate more oil revenue for his government. However, the president has broad powers to halt the opening of the sector. The energy ministry designs oil auctions and their timelines, selects the contract type for each oil block and can hand any field to Pemex. Many investors fear that an AMLO administration would make terms less attractive or cease holding the auctions that have allowed private firms to enter the country altogether.</P><P>In Brazil, the October presidential elections will also be a bellwether for the energy sector. President Michel Temer introduced energy policies making terms more attractive for international investors. He removed onerous local content requirements from bidding criteria, set a regular pre-salt bid round schedule and signed a law allowing companies other than state oil giant <mark>Petrobras</mark> to operate Brazil’s high-cost offshore pre-salt fields. The results have already been visible; in an October pre-salt auction, six of eight blocks on offer received bids, and signing bonuses totaled $1.9 billion.</P><P>While it is too early for formal candidacy announcements, former President Luis Inácio Lula da Silva is currently the clear front-runner despite having been convicted in July on charges of corruption, which he is appealing. If elected, Lula would likely reinstate his previous nationalist oil sector policies. In recent rallies with supporters, he has criticized Temer’s government for selling off Brazil’s wealth to foreign corporations and said <mark>Petrobras</mark> should be used as an instrument of development and job creation. If Lula is behind bars, he will likely throw his support behind another Worker’s Party candidate with a similar platform. Following Lula in the polls is right-wing nationalist Congressman João Bolsonaro. He has so far focused on security and social issues, and his positions on energy are unclear. Probable centrist candidates Geraldo Alckmin and João Doria – governor and mayor of São Paulo, respectively – favor investment-friendly policy. But both trail Lula and Bolsonaro in polls.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>In Colombia, a crowded field of candidates with a broad spectrum of economic and energy policy platforms are competing for the presidency.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>In Colombia, a crowded field of candidates with a broad spectrum of economic and energy policy platforms are competing for the presidency. Colombia has seen a steep decline in oil investment and revenue since the 2014 oil price collapse. Crude production has fallen since 2015. Less drilling has led to fewer discoveries, and at its current production rate, Colombia will run out of oil reserves in about five years. This is due to lower oil prices coupled with widespread local opposition to the oil and mining sectors, as some communities are demanding additional economic benefits and others oppose drilling based on environmental concerns.</P><P>Whether or not the sector will return to its former role as a primary driver of Colombia’s economy depends largely on whether the government can generate local community support for oil projects or chooses to prioritize other economic sectors. The field of potential candidates includes conservatives who want to promote oil investment through market-friendly reforms and leftist candidates who say Colombia should wean its economy off of oil, which causes environmental damage and is not a viable long-term driver of growth in a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy. With the crowded field and deep divisions over the controversial peace deal with the FARC, no candidate will likely secure a majority in May, and a second round in June is almost inevitable.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>In contrast to the other countries, Venezuela is unlikely to elect a new president or substantially change energy policy.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>In contrast to the other countries, Venezuela is unlikely to elect a new president or substantially change energy policy. Its constitution calls for elections next year – and President Nicolás Maduro has promised to hold them – but with the National Electoral Council stacked with Maduro allies and the president’s penchant for circumventing the democratic process, analysts predict he will rig the election to remain in power.</P><P>Venezuela’s oil industry – responsible for 96 percent of exports – is on the decline. The global oil price collapse exposed long-standing issues at state oil company PDVSA like underinvestment, lack of maintenance and un<mark>sustainable</mark> payments to support government programs. Production has plummeted, and with massive payments due to international creditors and much of the country’s oil output being used to pay off oil-backed loans, PDVSA cannot make the necessary investments to turn production around. But rather than introduce the reforms necessary to put Venezuela’s economy and oil sector back on track, Maduro has doubled down on failed policies like exchange rate controls and energy subsidies in a desperate effort to retain power.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Many Latin American presidents are hugely unpopular and voters are looking for change.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Many Latin American presidents are hugely unpopular and voters are looking for change. This landscape creates tremendous uncertainty for investors and companies in oil and other economic sectors. Energy has long been a politically charged issue in Latin America, leading to erratic approaches between one government and another and politically driven policies that have ultimately resulted in oil production declines. Rather than taking divisive positions on energy policy, the candidates should seek to build consensus and take a sober look at how to maximize productivity and deliver the greatest revenues for the state or prepare for diminished economic returns from the sector.</P></DIV><DIV class=""widget recommended fixes border inside-content""><H2>Recommended</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Photo by . Shell.</P></DIV><P dir=""ltr"">While a debate continues about the future of biofuels, Brazil is currently facing an important decision for its own future. Ethanol from sugar cane emerged in the years 2000 as a potential alternative to fossil fuels and possibly a game-changer for Brazil’s national economy. The production of flex-fuel vehicles able to run on a blend of ethanol and gasoline increased considerably in the same years. But the situation as it stands today is not <mark>sustainable</mark>, due to low production: Brazil is not capable of exporting ethanol, and flex-fuel vehicles now predominantly run on gasoline without a drop of ethanol in the fuel.</P><P dir=""ltr"">A lack of long term planning, petrol-dominated fuel markets, production decline resulting from the economic downturn, and global <mark>climate</mark> issues, have led Brazil into an ethanol crisis. However, a promising solution lies in delivering a package of incentives to the ethanol sector, which includes tax cuts and subsidized credit lines.</P><P dir=""ltr""><STRONG>1. A lack of long-term planning</STRONG></P><P dir=""ltr"">Experts interviewed by <A href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/portuguese/noticias/2013/05/130424_etanol_mdb.shtml"">BBC Brazil</A> agree that the growth and consolidation of the Brazilian ethanol industry will only occur when the government puts in place a policy with long-term focus. “The lack of government planning is the main cause for the ethanol crisis,” says bioenergy professor Luis Augusto Barbosa Cortez from The University of Campinas in the state of São Paulo. “This industry has existed in the country for over 40 years and, even now, there is no consolidated policy. The government takes action only sporadically, which does not solve the problem.”</P><P dir=""ltr"">Manufacturers prefer to produce sugar, rather than ethanol, due to more attractive prices. And since the discovery of the oil-rich geological layer off Brazil’s coast, the global market for biofuels is no longer a priority. Brazil’s state-controlled oil giant <mark>Petrobras</mark> was the first company in the world to find and produce oil and gas under the salt layer at depths of up to 7,000 meters under the water line. New oil fields discoveries make <mark>Petrobras</mark> and Brazil top players on global oil and gas market. With the focus back on fossil fuels, ethanol remains in the backdrop.</P><P dir=""ltr""><STRONG>2. The pervasive role of gasoline in the economy</STRONG></P><P dir=""ltr"">A <A href=""http://sugarcane.org/resource-library/books/Ethanol%20and%20Bioelectricity%20book.pdf"">survey</A> developed by Itaú Bank Investments, the publicly traded bank headquartered in São Paulo, showed that in January of 2009, 80% of flex-fuel vehicles primarily consumed ethanol; but that number dropped to 27% by October 2012. Ethanol has also been lagging behind in the ranks because of government interference in the price of gasoline.</P><P dir=""ltr"">From 2009 to 2012, ethanol consumption in Brazil declined from 17.9 billion liters to 11.3 billion liters annually; gasoline consumption, on the other hand, has only increased — rising from 25.4 billion liters to 39.7 billion liters consumed over the same time interval.</P><P dir=""ltr""><STRONG>3. International economic downturn and production decline</STRONG></P><P dir=""ltr"">The international financial crisis of 2008 also hit Brazil’s sugar mills hard. The crisis reduced credits and expanded planting costs, making sugarcane production more expensive.  The crisis also reduced investments in the sector, including the investments from foreign capital, through companies such as BP, Shell, and Bunge, that started investing during the 2008 “peak” of the ethanol market.</P><P dir=""ltr"">The sector has witnessed a systematic closure of sugar-mills.  According to the <A href=""http://www.unica.com.br/"">Brazilian Sugar Cane Industry Association</A> (UNICA), more than 40 sugar mills <A href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/portuguese/noticias/2013/05/130424_etanol_mdb.shtml"">shut down</A> from 2008 to 2012, 30 of which closed between 2011 and 2012 alone. Given this scenario, the Brazilian government released a package of measures last month to boost the sugarcane industry, which experts deemed an important encouragement yet too feeble to boost the sector.</P><P dir=""ltr"">On the positive side, however, Brazil is looking forward to the opening of <A href=""http://www.epe.gov.br/Petroleo/Documents/An%C3%A1lise%20de%20Conjuntura%20dos%20Biocombust%C3%ADveis%20-%20boletins%20peri%C3%B3dicos/An%C3%A1lise%20de%20Conjuntura%20dos%20Biocombust%C3%ADveis%20%E2%80%93%20Ano%202012.pdf"" target=""_blank"">nin</A><A href=""http://www.epe.gov.br/Petroleo/Documents/An%C3%A1lise%20de%20Conjuntura%20dos%20Biocombust%C3%ADveis%20-%20boletins%20peri%C3%B3dicos/An%C3%A1lise%20de%20Conjuntura%20dos%20Biocombust%C3%ADveis%20%E2%80%93%20Ano%202012.pdf"" target=""_blank"">e new ethanol plants</A> in the next three years.</P><P dir=""ltr""><STRONG>4) <mark>Climate</mark> issues and extreme weather conditions</STRONG></P><P dir=""ltr"">Extreme weather conditions damaged the latest harvests of sugarcane over several years: one year was too dry; another, very rainy; and the third, in 2012, brought a frost that hit several plantations. Conditions such as these contributed to the rising cost of ethanol. Extreme weather events, sometimes downplayed, actually catalyzed the vicious cycle of the ethanol crisis.</P><P dir=""ltr""><STRONG>Economic incentives to revive the ethanol industry</STRONG></P><P dir=""ltr"">Aiming to increase the supply of ethanol in the country, the government announced in April a package of incentives to the sector, which included tax cuts and subsidized credit lines. The purpose of this package is to encourage producers to opt for the manufacture of fuel over sugar, whose prices in international markets are currently more attractive.</P><P dir=""ltr"">With an increase in demand this year, the Brazilian government also expects a reduction in ethanol prices charged at the pump, which would enable ethanol to rise to a level playing field in the competition with gasoline. In addition, on May 1, the government implemented a mandatory increase in the proportion of ethanol in gasoline, from 20% to 25%. The increased proportion of ethanol in gasoline is not seen as an incentive for the industry, but as a benefit to <mark>Petrobras</mark>, which will need to import less gasoline to supply the domestic market.</P><P dir=""ltr"">The outlook for the ethanol industry in Brazil is slowly improving, but the market still depends on the implementation of a consolidated national policy that prioritizes and stimulates the production and commercialization of ethanol and other biofuels currently manufactured in the country. As long as there remains no strong policy, ethanol will be treated with sporadic actions and will remain in the shadow of the oil industry.</P><UL><LI><EM style=""font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"">Where do you stand on the biofuels debate? </EM></LI><LI><EM style=""font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"">Should we be concerned about ethanol’s overall environmental impact? </EM></LI><LI><EM style=""font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"">Considering recent technological advances in diesel emissions reductions and second generation ethanol production, does Brazil have better alternatives?</EM></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class=""related-posts""><DIV id=""related-posts-MRP_all"" class=""related-posts-type""><H2>Related Posts</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
