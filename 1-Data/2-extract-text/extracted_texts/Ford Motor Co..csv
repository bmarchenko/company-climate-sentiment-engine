CEOs at Ford, Goldman Sachs, Nike, and Starbucks spoke out against them.</P><P>When Indiana and North Carolina curbed anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, leaders of big companies strongly objected. PayPal <A href=""http://hrc-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com//files/assets/resources/NC_CEO_Letter_%283%29.pdf"">canceled plans</A> to expand in North Carolina, and the NBA moved its all-star game out of Charlotte.</P><P>But as President Trump prepares to back away from the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement, roll back the Obama administration’s signature <mark>climate change</mark> initiatives, and appoint an Environmental Protection Agency administrator who has repeatedly fought the agency, the leaders of corporate America have for the most part been muted or silent.</P><P>This poses a problem for environmentalists and their allies in Congress, particularly on the <mark>climate</mark> issue. </P><P>U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and a persistent advocate for <mark>climate change</mark> action, puts it this way: “One of the dirty secrets that we have to live with is that even the good-guy corporations don’t show up in Congress to lobby for doing something about <mark>climate change</mark>. Collectively, they do zero or less than zero to support <mark>climate</mark> legislation… That leaves the field to the bad guys.” </P><P>Without support from business, the environmental movement will struggle to defend itself against what David Goldston, director of government affairs for the Natural Resources Defense Council, calls an “incredible onslaught from both Congress and the administration.” What’s more, if environmentalists are to have any chance of convincing the federal government to enact stronger laws or regulations to curb <mark>climate change</mark> — a long shot, admittedly, for now — they will need big companies to use their political clout to turn around the Republicans who control Congress and the White House.</P><P>The reluctance of Fortune 500 companies to speak up on behalf of environmental protection is striking because it comes after decades of efforts by environmental nonprofits, ranging from The Nature Conservancy to Greenpeace, to develop partnerships with business. This work has paid off: Many companies have pledged to reduce their own <mark>carbon</mark> footprints, curb waste, and buy renewable energy. But few are willing to spend political capital on behalf of the environment.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">Why aren’t companies “speaking out more against the Trump administration’s ‘alternative facts’ on <mark>climate</mark>?”</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>The nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA is a case in point. “He’s not just bad on one thing,” says Fred Krupp, president of the business-friendly Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). “He’s bad on everything.” It’s the first time that EDF has campaigned against an EPA nominee, but the group has few business allies in the battle.</P><P>Tom Murray, an EDF vice president who works closely with business, says he hopes that “pragmatic business voices” will eventually step up to influence the Trump administration. “At this point, however, companies are hanging back on engaging in policy and politics,” he says. “Companies are trying to make sense of the new political landscape, concerned about becoming the president’s next social media target, and enticed by the potential of regulatory and tax reform.”</P><P>A business affiliate of the Natural Resources Defense Council called E2 (it stands for “environmental entrepreneurs”) did put together a letter from “<A href=""https://members.e2.org/jsp/controller?docName=petition(AlertPruittNomEPA)"">500 business leaders</A>” who oppose Pruitt, but the signatories include a registered nurse, a physical therapist, and not a single big-company CEO. </P><P>Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director, says big business needs to step up. “It simply makes no sense that big companies like Coke, Microsoft, Google, and other companies that care about and are doing great things with clean energy and sustainability aren’t speaking out more against the Trump administration’s ‘alternative facts’ on <mark>climate change</mark> and a national energy plan that will only increase our dependence on fossil fuels,” he says.</P><P>Worse, at least for environmentalists, some companies are actively turning against their erstwhile allies. Two days after Trump was elected, the Alliance of American Automobile Manufacturers, which represents Ford and General Motors, among others, urged the president’s transition team to roll back stringent fuel economy rules that were agreed to by the carmakers early in the Obama years. Environmentalists were stunned.</P><P>Says Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a nonprofit alliance of environmentalists and investors: “General Motors is doing a lot of good things on waste, they’re committed to 100 percent renewables, they’re supportive of the Paris talks. But on fuel economy standards, they like this new administration.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">In 2016, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google all donated more money to Republicans than Democrats.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>Meantime, as the political winds have shifted rightwards, so have campaign contributions from corporate political action committees (PACs). In 2016, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google — all of which had previously favored Democratic congressional candidates over Republicans — donated more money to Republicans than Democrats. Congressional Republicans have united to oppose plans to regulate the greenhouse gases that cause <mark>climate change</mark> since 2008.</P><P>All of this means that, when it comes to <mark>climate change</mark>, the loudest business voices in Washington belong to the fossil fuel industry and powerful trade associations, notably the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, that have staunchly opposed <mark>climate</mark> regulation. The chamber’s board includes executives from Accenture, Allstate Insurance, AT&amp;T, Caterpillar, Dow Chemical, FedEx, Florida Power &amp; Light, and Pfizer, all of which have pledged to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions. Public pension funds and so-called socially responsible investors have <A href=""http://www.ott.ct.gov/PolicyAndEducation/LettertoCompaniesAddressing<mark>Climate</mark>Change.pdf"">called on chamber members</A> to “address any misalignment between their own positions and actions on <mark>climate change</mark> and their funding of the chamber’s actions,” to little apparent effect.</P><P>To be sure, some big companies have backed up their <mark>climate change</mark> rhetoric with action in Washington. In 2009, Apple left the U.S. chamber over its <mark>climate change</mark> position and Nike resigned from the chamber board, citing the <mark>climate</mark> issue. Last year, Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft filed a legal brief in federal court supporting the EPA’s Clean Power Plan. General Mills, Mars, and Starbucks have lobbied side-by-side with Ceres on <mark>climate</mark> issues. </P><P>Since the election, Ceres, World Wildlife Fund, and a group called We Mean Business recruited a large number of small companies and a small number of large ones — Campbell Soup, DuPont, Gap, General Mills, HP, Intel, Kellogg, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mars, Mondelez, Monsanto, Staples, Starbucks, and Unilever, among them — to <A href=""http://www.low<mark>carbon</mark>usa.org/"">sign a letter</A> asking the new administration to affirm its commitment to the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement. Yet without further action at the state or federal level, the U.S. will probably fall short of meeting the <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> target that it agreed to in Paris, <A href=""https://phys.org/news/2016-09-track-<mark>carbon</mark>-<mark>pollution</mark>-goal.html"">experts say</A>.</P><P>Companies contacted by <EM>Yale Environment 360</EM> declined to discuss their Washington lobbying, campaign contributions, or trade association memberships. In a statement, Google explained its donations to Republican <mark>climate</mark> skeptics by saying: “Google engages on a wide variety of public policy issues and we work with policymakers and advocacy groups across the political spectrum. We’re never going to agree 100% with every organization or policymaker on every issue.” </P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">Corporations do not want to become a target of a president who is willing to call out individual companies by name.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>Gary Garfield, who recently retired as CEO of Bridgestone Tire, is one chief executive who did step up, wrangling senior executives in the tire industry to call for strong <mark>climate</mark> action. But he says environmental issues aren’t a priority for many CEOs because, unlike immigration or gay rights, they do not directly affect company employees. CEOs don’t want to unnecessarily aggravate political allies, shareholders, or employees over an issue that “doesn’t really directly affect their business,” he notes.
  </P><P>The Trump presidency complicates the calculus for businesses that need to manage an array of Washington issues, insiders say. “Companies absolutely care about <mark>climate change</mark>, but they care about other things too,” says Ceres’ Lubber. “They are balancing and juggling.” Corporations want Trump and the Republican Congress to support corporate tax cuts and infrastructure spending, and they do not want to become a target of a president who has been willing to call out individual companies by name. 
  </P><P>“Companies see a bully in the schoolyard, and they are off in the corner, doing their homework, and hoping the bully picks on someone else,” says Aron Cramer, the president and CEO of BSR, a network of businesses dedicated to sustainability. But, he says, business leaders understand the importance of <mark>climate policy</mark>, and they will speak up: “The underlying fundamentals will cause business to sustain their <mark>climate</mark> commitments and ultimately to be more vocal about those commitments.”

Washington and Boston</SPAN><SPAN class=""pubdata separator"">—</SPAN>The Trump administration’s latest move on environmental policy may sound like a familiar tussle: Green activists want to retain ambitious standards to reduce tailpipe emissions, while free-market advocates say automakers are saddled with onerous and unnecessary regulations.</P><P>Both those elements are there in the story line.

		</SPAN></A></H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Meanwhile, the environmentalist side of this debate has some hard facts to face up to. Even if former President Barack Obama's fuel efficiency target – an average of 54.5 miles per gallon for US car fleets by 2025 – were to remain in place, a rapid transition toward electric or “zero-emission” vehicles is far from guaranteed.</P><P>Sales of those vehicles are rising but still very small. The major US producer of those all-electric cars, Tesla, has stumbled out of the gate with a model aimed at a mass audience. And the path toward any true “de<mark>carbon</mark>ization” of the transportation sector is fraught with hurdles, such as making electric vehicles convenient to use, producing electric power increasingly without fossil fuels, and figuring out how to decouple economic prosperity from ever-rising miles traveled.</P><P>&quot;This [2025 target] is one point along a long trajectory. Even if we did hit the 2025 target, we can't slow down beyond that point,&quot; says Dave Cooke, an automotive expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group urging action to address <mark>climate change</mark>. From charging stations to power-grid enhancements to &quot;smart growth&quot; aimed at more walkable communities, &quot;there's got to be a much more fundamental shift on the infrastructure side of things.&quot;</P><P>This doesn't mean that corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards are unimportant. Many experts say the industry is capable of hitting the target finalized at the very end of the Obama administration, thanks to things like lighter materials and more efficient gas-powered engines.</P><H2>Slipping to 36 m.p.g.? </H2><P>The standards also help promote zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), such as electric cars. But those standards alone won’t answer the challenge posed by <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>In fact, under the complex CAFE system in which carmakers can get credits for things like more efficient air conditioning, even keeping the Obama administration rules in place wouldn’t mean new-car fleets would actually average 54.5 m.p.g. by 2025.</P><P>“We're actually on track to have 36 miles per gallon,” says Varun Sivaram, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of “Taming the Sun,” a new book on renewable energy.</P><P>On Monday, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said current CAFE standards are “too high,” and charged the Obama administration with “politically charged expediency” when it cut an evaluation process short in a bid to lock in its standards ahead of the change in administrations.</P><P>He also said he would reexamine the waiver that for years has allowed California to set its own alternative standard (which other states can voluntarily follow).</P><P>“Cooperative federalism doesn’t mean that one state can dictate standards for the rest of the country,” he said <A href=""https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-administrator-pruitt-ghg-emissions-standards-cars-and-light-trucks-should-be"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">in a statement Monday</A>. “EPA will set a national standard for greenhouse gas emissions that allows auto manufacturers to make cars that people both want and can afford — while still expanding environmental and safety benefits of newer cars.”</P><P>The waiver arose because California was pursuing its own air-quality regulation years before the federal Clean Air Act. Today, roughly one-third of Americans live in states that opted for California’s stringent standards.</P><H2>World weighs in </H2><P>The rise of ZEVs has some global momentum, thanks in part to the 2015 Paris Agreement on <mark>climate change</mark>, in which the vast majority of nations agreed to step up efforts to curb <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.</P><P>It’s not just environmental groups calling for concerted action. At Ford, CEO Jim Hackett and executive chairman Bill Ford don’t have a problem with a regulatory nudge toward cleaner cars. “Today, our planet faces increasing challenges [including] <mark>climate change</mark>,” <A href=""https://medium.com/cityoftomorrow/a-measure-of-progress-bc34ad2b0ed"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">they wrote</A> on March 27.</P><P>They asked not for a rollback of standards but “for one set of standards nationally, along with additional flexibility to help us provide more affordable options for our customers.”</P><P>Although improving fuel economy costs carmakers some money (adding modestly to the price of new cars), it also saves consumers money in lower gas-pump prices – or by substituting electric power for gasoline.</P><P>“The stringent standards still provide benefits in excess of costs” for the whole economy, even when oil prices are low, Mr. Sivaram says, <A href=""https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/07/dont-weaken-obamas-fuel-standards-000173"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">citing research he did</A> in 2015 with colleague Michael Levi.</P><P>Legally, the administration may face a legal test over the standards – one that gets steeper the more it attempts to roll back the rules.</P><P>“This is certain to go to the courts; it will be a significant legal battle,” says Cara Horowitz, co-executive director of the Emmett Institute on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the Environment at UCLA School of Law. And “the more aggressive the EPA is in reducing the stringency of the existing federal standards, the more difficult it will be for the EPA to justify that evaluation.”</P><H2>Uncertainty rising</H2><P>Court challenges could come along two fronts. Opponents could sue to stop any loosening of the rules, possibly citing the EPA’s own finding that greenhouse gases threaten the <mark>climate</mark>. Also, California could sue if the EPA tries to take away its waiver.</P><P>The risk of a years-long legal battle is unsettling for carmakers, leaving them to decide how much to back away from efforts to develop and sell cleaner cars.</P><P>“If this doesn’t get resolved for a while, then that really creates a lot of uncertainty,” says David Gerard, a professor of economics at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis. “If they had a choice between the current rules and not finding out for 10 years, they’d probably choose the current rules.”</P><P>Of course, the industry isn’t monolithic and thus strategies vary. Tesla is betting solely on the future of electric cars – but has been challenged in trying to ramp up production of its newest sedans. Toyota has met a good many of the emissions goals with its Prius hybrid strategy.</P><P>Some other major car companies are rushing out electric models simply to comply with federal rules, says Bruce Belzowski, managing director of the automotive Futures group of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Even Nissan, an early innovator with its all-electric Leaf, seems to have fallen back from cutting-edge <mark>innovation</mark>, he adds. “It makes you wonder about what their strategy is.”</P><P>The rise of self-driving cars throws an added wild card into the mix, says Mr. Cooke at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington. It’s not clear if it’ll reduce or expand the overall number of miles traveled – a distinction that matters a lot for total vehicle emissions.</P><DIV class=""injection""><DIV id=""ezve-inbody-newsletter-widget"" class=""eznid-1057286""><DIV id=""ezve-inbody-newsletter-widget-block"" class=""ezc-csm_html_block ezn-weekender_newsletter ""><DIV class=""newsletter-email-signup newsletter_signup_box sfmc_newsletter""><H2 class=""text-center"">Follow Stories Like This</H2><P>Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>It’s an example he says, of how fuel-economy rules are only one piece of a larger puzzle.</P><P>“The industry is global in nature at this point ... but so is the problem of <mark>climate change</mark>,” Cooke says.  And “we are a culture built around the automobile in large respects.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""story-foot""><DIV class=""rating feedback-widget""><DIV class=""question""><SPAN>Did this story deliver on A shift in thought?</SPAN>  </DIV><DIV class=""feedback down stash"">

Rockefeller Brothers Fund President Steven Heintz invoked the family's moral responsibility, then summoned up founding father John D., <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2014/9/24/rockefeller_foundation_divests_from_fossil_fuels"" target=""_hplink"">saying</A>, &quot;I'm convinced that if he were alive today -- he was an innovative, forward-looking businessman -- he would recognize that the opportunity in the future is clean energy technology, and he'd be leading the business charge to get us to that economy.&quot;</P><P>Family influence isn't new.

The longitudinal and multi-dimensional analysis investigates the dynamics of the <mark>climate change</mark> problem in terms of socio-political mobilization by social movements, scientists, wider publics and policymakers.

The paper not only applies the DILC-model, but also proposes three elaborations: (a) the continued diversity of technical solutions, and ‘ups and downs’ in future expectations, creates uncertainty which delays strategic reorientation; (b) firms may develop radical <mark>innovation</mark>s for political and social purposes in early phases of the model; (c) issue lifecycles are also shaped by external influences from other problems and contexts.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><UL class=""issue-navigation"" id=""issue-navigation""><LI class=""previous""><BUTTON class=""button-alternative button-alternative-tertiary"" disabled="""" type=""button""><SPAN class=""button-alternative-text""><SPAN><STRONG>Previous </STRONG>article<SPAN class=""extra-detail""> in issue</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></BUTTON></LI></UL></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

To understand and address this challenge, <mark>Ford Motor Com</mark>pany and the University of Michigan School of Natural Resources and Environment student team developed a strategy for managing greenhouse gas emissions in the vehicle supply chain. Since December 2008, the team has supported the engagement of suppliers through the development and administration of a survey to collect allocated greenhouse gas data and environmental management practices information. The student team also advanced industry-wide participation through collaboration with the Automotive Industry Action Group to standardize greenhouse gas reporting requests provided to suppliers. Additionally, the student team evaluated public reporting options, specifically by engaging Ford as tester of the new Scope 3 Greenhouse Gas <mark>Carbon</mark> Accounting Standard drafted by the World Resource Institute and the World Business Council for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development.

Taking a second look this year, however, CDP found the picture is changing, as more companies are mapping out a low-<mark>carbon</mark> future. While some politicians continue to stubbornly ignore <mark>climate change</mark>, businesses are, nonetheless, getting down to work.</P><P>The CDP is a major source of company <mark>carbon</mark> emission data for more than 800 investors managing assets of over $100 trillion. It tracks corporations’ environmental behavior, including their transparency, philosophies, and actions. The non-profit organization also measures companies’ efforts to protect water and forests. Over 6,200 companies disclose environmental data to the CDP.</P><P>The first encouraging sign in this year’s CDP findings is that 58% of the high-impact combines responded to CDP’s requests for information. These companies frepresent the entire global economy, weighted towards higher <mark>carbon</mark> emitters and big companies.

This past April, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed the Paris Agreement on <mark>climate change</mark> at a United Nations ceremony in New York City, promising Canada would seek out solutions in harnessing the power of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Two main strategies were proposed in the Paris Agreement to achieve meeting <mark>CO2</mark> reduction targets. The first underscores the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions; the second stresses the reduction of fossil fuel consumption.</SPAN></P><P class=""title"" align=""justify""><SPAN style=""color: #000000;"">The Transformative Research to Combat <mark>Climate Change</mark> Challenge Workshop focused <STRONG>on a third paradigm, specifically using approaches for converting <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide to value-added chemicals and fuels.</STRONG> Such strategies could enable energy security, environmental protection and <mark>climate</mark> control. The vision of an energy transition to an economy founded on <mark>CO2</mark> as a chemical feed-stock presents a credible science and engineering model with a calculable cost, assessable risk, and a definable benefit over a quantifiable development time period.</SPAN></P><P class=""title"" align=""justify""><SPAN style=""color: #000000;"">One of the goals of the workshop was to showcase transformative research approaches to renewable chemicals such as dimethyl ether, poly<mark>carbon</mark>ates and <mark>carbon</mark> fibers, and transportation fuels using <mark>CO2</mark> as a precursor. Plenary speaker Professor Peter Styring of the University of Sheffield, a world-renowned expert in the field of WHAT, delivered a pragmatic approach in European contrast for CCU.</SPAN></P><P class=""title"" align=""justify""><SPAN style=""color: #000000;"">Other invited industry speakers included Emmanuel Varenne of Volvo Group Trucks Technology, Dr. Rebecca

The company is grappling with low oil prices and investigations from attorneys general into allegations that it downplayed the economic threat of <mark>climate change</mark>—and today will face a raft of resolutions demanding that it acknowledge and tackle rising temperatures.</P><P>“Folks perceive them to be a leader in the fight against addressing <mark>climate change</mark>,” said Danielle Fugere, president of the As You Sow nonprofit group, one of several that submitted resolutions to Exxon.</P><P>“They are the face of the anti-<mark>climate</mark> movement. And I think that’s why we see so many resolutions against Exxon,” Fugere said.</P><P>“They’re such an easy target, but they make themselves an easy target,” added W. Andrew Mims of the Sustainability Group, a division within Boston-based investment house Loring, Wolcott &amp; Coolidge.</P><P>Of the 14 resolutions before Exxon, eight deal with global warming or environmental controversies, such as hydraulic fracturing. They prod the oil giant to acknowledge that insurgent energy sources and <mark>climate</mark> regulations—namely those agreed to by most of the world’s nations under the Paris Agreement—threaten its existence.</P><P>Boards of directors typically oppose shareholder resolutions, which rarely pass without support from the board. Exxon opposes all the resolutions slated to be voted on today and petitioned the Securities and Exchange Commission to keep one <mark>climate</mark> resolution off the ballot.</P><P>As of last night, environmental demonstrators protesting Exxon’s track record on <mark>climate change</mark> and calling for the sale of company stock were preparing for a rally this morning outside the symphony hall. Nearby they made room for an ice block to be carved with the phrase “#ExxonKnew,” a reference to the revelation that company scientists warned Exxon management of <mark>climate change</mark> risks decades ago.</P><P>Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said in an interview that there are more resolutions than are typical for annual meetings.</P><P>He said Exxon addressed questions from shareholders about <mark>climate</mark> policies, their possible effect on business, changes in energy demand and “<mark>carbon</mark> asset risk” in a <A href=""http://cdn.exxonmobil.com/~/media/global/files/energy-and-environment/report---energy-and-<mark>carbon</mark>---managing-the-risks.pdf"" target=""_blank"">report</A> issued in 2014.</P><P>“The risk of <mark>climate change</mark> is clear and the risk warrants action,” reads one of Exxon’s statements on <mark>climate change</mark>. “We have the same concerns as people everywhere—and that is how to provide the world with the energy it needs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.”</P><H2>Past may be prologue, but shareholders are optimistic</H2><P>In the wake of the international accord on <mark>climate change</mark> struck in Paris in December, the number of <mark>climate</mark>-related shareholder resolutions worldwide hit an all-time high.</P><P>The strategy behind such advocacy is simple: to use one’s financial stake within a company to raise an issue and lobby for changes.</P><P>Though resolutions are typically nonbinding, the variety of proposals filed in a given year and the amount of support they receive provide good indications of investor sentiment.</P><P>Shareholders at BP PLC, Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Statoil ASA last year approved resolutions to disclose how the companies view the financial risks associated with <mark>climate change</mark> by nearly unanimous votes. Glencore PLC, the international commodity and coal firm, passed a comparable measure Thursday with 98 percent support.</P><P>“They’re really just sensible risk management,” Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at the Church Commissioners for England, said of those past policies.</P><P>For its part, Exxon projects oil demand worldwide will continue to grow, expanding by more than 13 percent from today’s figures by 2040.</P><P>Yet one of the International Energy Agency’s forecasts—a circumstance in which governments cap greenhouse gas emissions—estimates oil demand could fall by more than 20 percent by 2040.</P><P>While Exxon has never passed a resolution related to <mark>climate change</mark>, shareholders worried about global warming are optimistic that today will be different.</P><P>“The world is changing; the world is starting to adapt,” said Andrew Logan of Ceres, the <mark>sustainable</mark> investment advocacy group. What investors are asking for, he said, “seems astonishingly modest.”</P><H2>CalPERS tries to wield its $1B in influence</H2><P>Among today’s eight environmental resolutions are several asking Exxon to publish reports with long-term planning and outlooks, omitting commercially sensitive information.</P><P>To meet the goals reached in Paris to limit warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius beyond preindustrial temperatures, <mark>carbon</mark> fuels will have to remain untapped, said Anne Simpson of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), which invests about $300 billion.</P><P>“You can’t burn everything that’s on these companies’ balance sheets,” Simpson said.</P><P>As the biggest U.S public pension fund, CalPERS owns about $1 billion in Exxon stock and is backing a resolution that would compel the company to commission a report on the long-term “impacts of public <mark>climate change</mark> policies” on its business.</P><P>CalPERS is also backing a proposal for “proxy access”—authored by New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, the fiduciary for the city’s five public pension funds, worth more than $150 billion—that would allow shareholders to nominate candidates to the Exxon board.</P><P>Stringer’s office has targeted dozens of fossil fuel companies this year and last with this strategy, specifically citing <mark>climate</mark> concerns.</P><P>“Investors would benefit from an assessment of ExxonMobil’s oil and gas reserves under a scenario consistent with the global emissions reduction target defined in the Paris Agreement,” Simpson and Stringer told Exxon shareholders in a letter.</P><P>Other <mark>climate</mark> resolutions on the table call for Exxon to have a <mark>climate change</mark> expert on its board and to finalize a policy “acknowledging the imperative to limit global average temperature increases to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels.”</P><P>In an attempt to encourage markets to value oil suppliers like Exxon and “think outside the barrel,” Fugere submitted a proposal that would require the oil giant to report its energy reserves in units of energy—British thermal units—instead of barrels of crude.</P><P>“They have actually been at least slightly supportive of the concept,” said Fugere, who called that reaction surprising.</P><H2>Please leave your name with the secretary</H2><P>Investors who have filed resolutions with Exxon for years described the oil giant as a savvy, well-run company whose leaders understand the financial and reputational risks of <mark>climate change</mark> and who are willing to meet to discuss shareholder proposals but often disagree.</P><P>They also describe Exxon as a difficult but rewarding hurdle—a company whose support of <mark>climate</mark> policies could trigger broader acceptance and awareness throughout the energy industry and among investors of the financial risks that <mark>climate change</mark> poses. The challenge and the potential payoff, they said, are what motivates them to turn in resolutions year after year.</P><P>Tim Smith is a director of shareholder engagement at Walden Asset Management, a Boston investment firm, who has been working on shareholder advocacy since the 1970s. He said that in the last few years, Exxon officials have met for the better part of a day in New York with 25 to 30 shareholders to talk about <mark>climate</mark> issues. “Not just a dog-and-pony show,” he said.</P><P>But four stockholders said Exxon does not allow them to talk with board members directly, a practice they find frustrating.</P><P>“That’s not normal. Usually you can have access in some way to the board,” said Mike Crosby, a Franciscan friar from Milwaukee who began his corporate engagement career in 1973 at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR).</P><P>Sister Patricia Daly, a nun from New Jersey who is famous within shareholder advocacy circles and is a colleague of Crosby’s, agreed.</P><P>“They get really angry if we attempt to communicate with a board member outside the corporate secretaries,” Daly said.</P><P>Jeffers said the board set that policy. “It’s inaccurate to say the company has a policy,” he said.</P><H2>A priest and a nun walk into a shareholders meeting</H2><P>The shareholder advocacy world is small and traces much of its history back to groups like the ICCR, a group of several hundred religious institutions that together oversee $100 billion in assets.</P><P>While they each direct small sums of company stocks compared to Wall Street firms or mainstream asset managers, Father Crosby, Sister Daly and Smith are widely known by name and history.</P><P>The trio are perennials at corporate meetings, each with decades of experience filing proposals and working on matters of the environment, human trafficking, health, water use and other subjects.</P><P>“We regularly engage with them and look forward to that,” Exxon’s Jeffers said of Crosby and Daly.</P><P>“She’s been a visionary leader in identifying issues of social and environmental concern,” <mark>Ford Motor Co.</mark> Executive Chairman Bill Ford said of Daly in 2014. They worked together on environmental sustainability at the automaker.</P><P>“Pat is my candidate for sainthood,” said Stephen Viederman, a shareholder engagement expert in New York.</P><P>“Pat was identified as an RN at one point. A ‘radical nun,’” he said, before chiming in again: “Oh! Father Mike is great. He, too, could be saint.”</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>wire with permission from Environment &amp; Energy Publishing, LLC. <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/"" target=""_blank"">www.eenews.net</A>, 202-628-6500</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The Obama administration issued a version of the rules in 2012 that would reduce emissions around 6 billion tons by 2025. By 2016, after three years in place, the latest standards had increased average fuel economy by two miles per gallon. The EPA said that car manufacturers were easily meeting the requirement.</P><P>But automakers have argued since the regulations were put in place that the standards should get a midterm reevaluation to reconsider what should happen for cars in model years 2022-2025. After the 2016 presidential election, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the most powerful auto trade group, argued that the reevaluation should wait until the new administration took office. But in the last days of the Obama administration, the EPA said that the standard shouldn’t change.</P><P>After inauguration, CEOs from GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler met with Trump and reportedly discussed the standards; on February 10, CEOs from 18 global car companies sent a letter to Trump opposing the standards. Later in February, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and Global Automakers, another trade group, wrote to the new EPA head Scott Pruitt asking him to repeal finalization of the standards. Shortly after that–and a legal petition from the groups–the EPA announced that it would withdraw finalization of the standards. The trade groups also pushed for California to “harmonize” its more stringent standards with federal standards, and advocated against Obama-era emissions standards for light-duty vehicles.</P><P>Some automakers have also individually advocated for weaker fuel economy standards, at the same time that they voice public support for <mark>climate</mark> action. Ford argued that the standards would reduce the affordability of new vehicles. But at the same time, after Trump announced his intent to withdraw from the Paris agreement on <mark>climate change</mark>, Ford chairman Bill Ford <A href=""http://www.wri.org/blog/2017/06/global-leaders-deliver-message-resolve-following-trump%E2%80%99s-decision-abandon-paris-0"">said</A> that the company believes “<mark>climate change</mark> is real, and remains deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_1""><DIV class=""ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap""><DIV class=""ad-wrapper__ad-slug"">advertisement</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV><P>Ford also has a new dedicated electric vehicle team, and has committed to reduce spending on internal combustion engine cars by one third and redirect that money into developing electric cars. In a statement to <EM>Fast Company, </EM>Ford reiterated its commitment to reducing emissions and said, at the same time, that the auto industry’s “collective support for tough fuel economy rules that were 13 years into the future was predicated on a sensible notion–check halfway through to make sure the data and targets matched up.”</P><P>The trade group lobbying is “really counter to what a lot of these companies, like Toyota and Volkswagen, have been kind of posturing on their websites,” says Tanner. “Toyota Prius really benefited from California’s electric vehicle regulations a decade ago, and enabled it, really. To now stand by while their two key trade groups push this agenda is startling.”</P><P>Toyota tells <EM>Fast Company</EM> that it “believes deeply in the benefits of improvements in fuel economy and the reduction of greenhouse gases” but that fuel economy standards should be reviewed to “help ensure they help grow our economy, reduce the impact on the environment and serve the best interest of our customers.”</P><P>Like Ford, Toyota argues that the standards need to protect affordability for customers, though a Consumers Union <A href=""http://consumersunion.org/news/cu-car-affordability-report/"">report</A> found that as cars have become more efficient over the past two decades, they haven’t become much more expensive. And with better fuel economy, consumers ultimately save money on gas.</P><P>Toyota didn’t respond before publication when asked why stronger fuel economy standards wouldn’t be to its advantage, given that it already makes more efficient cars than some competitors. Volkswagen and Volvo also didn’t respond to a request for comment. But it’s somewhat surprising that as the companies shift to more electric cars they wouldn’t also support regulations that could increase sales of those cars.</P><P>“If [Volkswagen] wants to go all-electric, it should push for the regulations in order to make itself more competitive when it does so,” says Tanner. “Silence while your trade groups are taking the opposite position–or stay within the trade group–is something that needs to be called out.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE><FOOTER class=""post__footer""><DIV class=""author author--post""><H4 class=""author__title"">About the author</H4><P class=""author__description"">Adele Peters is a staff writer at Fast Company who focuses on solutions to some of the world's largest problems, from <mark>climate change</mark> to homelessness.

</SPAN></DIV><P>President Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris international <mark>climate</mark> treaty hasn't shaken automakers' resolve to continue developing cleaner, more fuel-efficient vehicles.</P><P>General Motors, Ford Motor and industry groups didn't condemn Trump's decision last week, but told<EM> Automotive News</EM> that their sustainability plans remain unchanged.</P><P>&quot;GM will not waver from our commitment to the environment, and our position on <mark>climate change</mark> has not changed,&quot; the company said in a statement. &quot;International agreements aside, we remain committed to creating a better environment.&quot;</P><P>Ford affirmed its position that &quot;<mark>climate change</mark> is real,&quot; saying it remains &quot;deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities.&quot;</P><P>Most outspoken was Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who wrote in a Twitter message that Trump's decision would prompt him to resign from two presidential advisory panels on which he serves.</P><P>&quot;<mark>Climate change</mark> is real,&quot; <STRONG><A href=""/apps/pbcsedit.dll/"" target=""_blank"">wrote Musk</A></STRONG>, who has touted his electric-vehicle and solar-energy businesses as direct responses to the dangers of <mark>climate change</mark>. &quot;Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.&quot;</P><P>Prior to Trump's announcement, Musk said he had done all he could to persuade Trump on the matter.</P><P>GM CEO Mary Barra, a member of the White House's top business advisory council along with Musk, has no plans to quit that group.</P><H13>Barra's plans</H13><P>&quot;Mary Barra's participation on the President's Strategy and Policy Forum provides GM a seat at an important table to contribute to a constructive dialogue about key policy issues,&quot; the company said. &quot;The Forum continues to provide an opportunity to work with the administration and other corporate leaders on policies that support a strong and competitive economy and automotive industry.&quot;</P><P>Trump's announcement came the same day that GM <A href=""/apps/pbcsedit.dll/"" target=""_blank"">released its annual sustainability report</A> in which it outlined its environmental accomplishments and initiatives. In it, Barra said, &quot;Environmental stewardship and sustainability are part of our business model and core to our operations.&quot;</P><P>The 2015 Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreements encompassed nearly all the world's nations in a commitment to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and accelerate the shift to renewable energy resources.</P><P>Supporters of the U.S. withdrawal said the pact would impose unfair environmental standards on the U.S. and endanger jobs in the fossil-fuel sector and other industries. In a speech last week, Trump called the decision &quot;a reassertion of America's sovereignty,&quot; saying he was &quot;elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.&quot; (Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduta issued an executive order affirming the city's commitment to the accord and denounced Trump's &quot;imprudent announcements.&quot;)</P><P>Trump said he wanted to negotiate a better deal for the U.S. But several world leaders said the deal is not open for renegotiation.</P><H13>Impact on industry</H13><P>Trump cited the negative impact of the treaty on the U.S. auto industry, among many others.

At the center of this shift – the rapidly changing automobile industry – has been a crucial part of the solution to developing <mark>sustainable</mark> and smart technologies to address these key societal and economic trends.  As the automotive industry experiences the most fundamental shift in 100 years, Bill Ford is challenging the status quo, overturning a century of conventional wisdom in the auto industry. In a 2011 TED talk, he told the audience and the world that the goal of having everyone own a car was no longer a good idea and called for smart mobility instead. Under Bill Ford’s visionary leadership, <mark>Ford Motor Com</mark>pany has been a trailblazer in adapting its business model to create transportation <mark>innovation</mark>s that are good for the world and that make people’s lives better.As an avid environmentalist, Bill’s commitment to sustainability has played a significant role in reducing the environmental footprint of Ford’s manufacturing operations and setting an example for other industries, while expanding the company’s investment in small-car, electric, or high-efficiency hybrid vehicles. </DIV>On Twitter?

In a victory for automakers, the Trump administration has reversed an Obama administration decision to finalize the rules for the model years between 2022 and 2025, reopening a review that was scheduled to take place in 2018.</P><P class=""p-text"">Dan Becker, director of the Safe <mark>Climate</mark> Campaign, said Ford “hypocritically declares its concern for the environment” at the same time it is “colluding with Donald Trump” to roll back the mpg rules. He also noted that Ford and other automakers agreed to the gas mileage rules in 2012.</P><P class=""p-text"">“Bill Ford has proclaimed himself a conservationist, and the company declared to its shareholders that quote ‘we know <mark>climate change</mark> is real and a critical threat and we will continue to work leaders around the world in support of ambitious global greenhouse gas reduction targets,’ ” Becker said. “Ford is capable of making clean cars. They should just get on with it and stop fighting it.”</P><P class=""p-text"">Margie Alt, executive director of Environment America, added: “As the best-selling car brand in the U.S., and one of our most historic auto manufacturers, <mark>Ford Motor Co.</mark> should be a leader, not a laggard, when it comes to getting zero-emission vehicles on the road.”</P><P class=""p-text"">The complaints about Ford are at the center of a new campaign called “Forward, Not Backward” that was launched Wednesday by the Sierra Club, Public Citizen, Greenpeace, Safe <mark>Climate</mark> Campaign and Environment America. The groups say their aim is to convince Ford and other automakers to “stop working behind the scenes with the Trump administration to roll back the popular standards.”</P><P class=""p-text"">Becker accused Ford of dragging its feet on boosting the fuel performance of its vehicles, in addition to lobbying the Trump administration to roll back the gas stringent mileage rules.</P><P class=""p-text"">“Ford lags near the bottom of the heap on fuel efficiency and <mark>pollution</mark>,” he said. “It’s the third worst among the 12 major automakers. Ford fails to use the best technology on the bulk of its vehicles. It’s at the back of the pack on four of the six key efficiency technologies highlighted by EPA in its trends report.”</P><P class=""p-text"">John Viera, global director of sustainability and vehicle environmental matters for Ford, vehemently disputed the allegation that his company is acting hypocritically when it comes to the gas mileage rules.</P><P class=""p-text"">“If you go back to 2012, we didn’t commit to a 2025 number,” he said. “What we committed to was having a mid-term review to determine what the number was going to be for 2025. We’re not working behind the scenes to get (the rules) rolled back. We’re working to get all parties at the table, like we did in 2012.”</P><P class=""p-text"">Viera pointed to announcements from Ford in recent years about plans to spend $4.5 billion on “electrified vehicle solutions” by 2020 and introduce 13 new electric or hybrid vehicles globally in the next five years as evidence of the company’s commitment to fuel efficiency.</P><P class=""p-text"">“Our company has shown a lot of leadership and initiative when it comes to fuel efficiency,” he said.</P><P class=""p-text"">The gas mileage rules, which Ford and other automakers have said could be too ambitious, requires automakers to go from an average of over 35 miles per gallon for 2017 models to producing car and truck fleets that average more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025.</P><P class=""p-text"">The environmental attack on Ford comes as green groups have released new polling showing drivers in Michigan and other states are in favor of keeping the gas mileage rules in place. The poll, conducted on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council, NextGen America and the Sierra Club, showed 73 percent of registered voters in Michigan are in favor of enforcing the gas mileage rules.</P><P class=""p-text"">Industry observers say fuel economy appears to matter mostly on the margin in car purchasing decisions — drivers who are in the market for an SUV might compare mileage notes on various models, but not switch to smaller vehicle — but it has not historically been a tipping point.</P><P class=""p-text"">Rebecca Lindland, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, said fuel economy typically ranks behind factors like durability, reliability and cargo space for most car buyers.</P><P class=""p-text"">“It’s typically in the lower part of the top 10 reasons, especially when gas prices are low,” she said. “When gas prices increase, people are more concerned, but at the end of the day, things like utility, safety and cargo room still out rank fuel economy. What people want is a fuel efficient version of what they already want to buy.”</P><P class=""p-text"">Environmentalists argue their new polling shows that research is out-of-date.</P><P class=""p-text"">“Michiganders want cleaner, more efficient cars, not more air <mark>pollution</mark> and increased costs at the pump,” said Andrew Linhardt, deputy legislative director for transportation at the Sierra Club. “These rules are driving technological <mark>innovation</mark>, cutting dangerous <mark>pollution</mark>, saving families money, and reducing America’s reliance on oil.”</P><P class=""p-text"">The mileage rules at issue call for automakers to achieve a fleetwide average mileage rate of more than 36 miles per gallon for cars and trucks in 2018. The standard then increases to more than 37 miles per gallon in 2019 and nearly 39 miles per gallon in 2020, which is the last year before automakers will have a chance to weigh in on the need for any course corrections.</P><P class=""p-text"">The rules for mileage years 2022 and 2025 were by law originally set to be reviewed for their feasibility by April 2018, but the Trump administration has said it is also looking at the feasibility of the rules for the 2021 model year, by which automakers will be required to hit a combined average of 41 miles per gallon for their cars and trucks.</P><P class=""p-text"">Under the current rules, automakers will face fines of $5.50 for each one-tenth of a mile-per-gallon their average fuel economy falls short of the standard for a model year, multiplied by the total volume of vehicles sold under the new regulations.</P><P class=""p-text"">Viera, the Ford sustainability director, said the Dearborn automaker and other manufacturers are just asking for the review of the mileage rules that they were promised in 2012, arguing that the Obama administration rushed to finalize the rules ahead of schedule.</P><P class=""p-text"">“All we’re asking from the new administration was for them to reinstate the original timeline so we can have a data-driven review,” he said. “We’ve taken the position that other auto manufacturers have taken, so we’re not unique in that sense.”</P><P class=""p-text"">klaing@detroitnews.com</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Global <mark>climate change</mark> is exacerbating existing challenges for the marginalized in our society, such as food and water security, migration and global health.</P><P>Companies in these three industries make up some of the largest contributors to global emissions while also facing the greatest <mark>climate</mark>-related risks due to business models that rely on fossil fuels. Investors have come a long way since these engagements began in the 1990s; Companies that once denied that <mark>climate change</mark> was real are beginning to look at <mark>climate change</mark> as a material financial risk. When the Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016, the goal to limit warming to below 2 degrees Celsius set a global standard for the GHG emissions reductions required to prevent further irreparable harm to our planet. Despite this progress, corporations have to make significant business model shifts to prepare for the low-<mark>carbon</mark> transition, and investors will continue to hold companies to the targets set by the Paris goals in future engagements as well as to do their part to address <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals 7 (Energy Access) and 13 (<mark>Climate</mark> Action).</P><P>We continue to press companies to adopt science-based greenhouse gas reduction goals, engage constructively on <mark>climate policy</mark>, conduct scenario planning which includes low-<mark>carbon</mark> scenarios, and invest in clean energy research, development and deployment. This work is complemented by efforts in <A href=""http://tricri.org/<mark>climate</mark>-finance/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><mark>Climate</mark> Finance</A> to assess how we might direct more investment dollars toward the energy transition.</P><P>We are also inspired in our work by faith leaders who have highlighted the moral dimensions of <mark>climate change</mark>, most prominently with Pope Francis’ encyclical Laudato Si’. As the Pope wrote, “The <mark>climate</mark> is a common good, belonging to all and meant for all.”  This concern for the common good, especially for those most vulnerable to the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>, is the basis of our work and informs our approach in our corporate engagements.</P><H4><STRONG>2017-2018 Engagement Priorities</STRONG></H4><H4>Oil and Gas</H4><P>Focus Companies – <EM>ExxonMobil, Chevron, Apache</EM></P><P>During the 2017 shareholder season, investors pushed companies in the oil and gas sector for greater disclosure of <mark>climate</mark>-related risks, in the form of resolutions asking for a 2 degree scenario analysis or business plan. Many Tri-CRI members co-filed the ExxonMobil resolution, led by the NY State Common Retirement Fund and the Church of England, which received majority investor support – 62.10% – at the annual meeting. Investors will continue to engage the company on what a robust 2 degree scenario analysis should include. Members also co-filed a resolution at Chevron, led by As You Sow, with a more robust “Low-<mark>Carbon</mark> Transition” ask, which also received 27% support. The Coalition will continue to support engagements with these companies as co-filers and encourage robust understanding of <mark>climate</mark> risks and disclosure aligned with the transformation called for in the Paris Agreement.</P><H4>Utilities</H4><P>Focus Company – <EM>Southern Company</EM></P><P>Southern Company is the second largest GHG emitter in the country and is exposed to significant <mark>climate</mark> related risks, but lacks public-facing disclosure of business plans for resiliency in a <mark>carbon</mark>-constrained future. The Dominican Sisters of Caldwell re-filed the “Business Plan for 2C Warming Scenario” resolution with Southern Company in 2017 after the company failed to improve its <mark>climate</mark>-related disclosures this past year. The resolution gained support from investors representing 45.71% of shares, an impressive increase from 34% the prior year. Investors will continue to engage the company on expectations for a strong 2 degree business plan in the coming year. The framework established by the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement and IEA 2˚C scenario will likely involve significant shifts to lower <mark>carbon</mark> electricity generation to achieve the needed emissions reductions.  Given the long-term planning horizons in the utility sector, investors urged Southern to disclose its business plan for achieving a competitive return on capital and addressing the opportunities of transitioning to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy while providing safe, reliable, and affordable energy. Investors are seeking increased disclosure that includes goals for reducing emissions, plans to integrate technological, regulatory, and business model <mark>innovation</mark>s; and alignment of incentives, research and development, and public policy positions with this strategy.</P><H4>Automotive</H4><P>Focus Companies – <EM>Ford, General Motors</EM></P><P>The Tri-State Coalition leads engagements with Ford and General Motors on developing robust electrification strategies in line with the Paris goals as well as aligning public policy positions (on the CAFE Standards and EPA GHG Emissions Midterm Review) to the company’s objectives. These are longstanding dialogues with broad participation from ICCR members. This shareholder season, investors will continue to engage both companies on public policy as well as their strategies for business model alignment to the 2 degrees warming scenario by monitoring how companies are maintaining commitments to doubling fleet-wide average fuel economy to 54.5 mpg by the 2025 model year.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><H5>Statements of Faith Leaders on <mark>Climate Change</mark>:</H5><P>This list of <A href=""http://www.interfaithpowerandlight.org/religious-statements-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Religious Statements on <mark>Climate Change</mark></A> composed by Interfaith Power &amp; Light demonstrates the potential for interfaith collaboration to address <mark>climate change</mark>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><H5>Resources:</H5></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

Executives often urge shareholders to vote down such resolutions, and there are concerns this year that the administration's positions could lead to even more complacency, by both companies and their investors.</P><P>Perhaps the most susceptible to ripples of the administration's assault on <mark>climate</mark> and environment policies this year are the nearly two dozen resolutions focused on methane emissions and on the impact of measures limiting global temperature rise caused by burning fossil fuels.</P><H3>Limiting Methane Emissions – or Not</H3><P>At least six oil, gas and electric utility companies, including Chevron, are facing shareholder resolutions calling on executives to explain the steps they're taking to minimize <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/16022018/methane-leaks-oil-natural-gas-data-global-warming-pennsylvania-edf-study"">emissions of methane</A>, a <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/tags/short-lived-<mark>climate</mark>-pollutants"">short-lived <mark>climate</mark> pollutant</A> that's one of the most potent greenhouse gases.</P><P>While investor groups raise concerns, however, the Trump administration has embarked on a mission—cheered on by organizations like the <A href=""http://www.api.org/"">American Petroleum Institute</A>—to roll back most of the Obama-era requirements for reducing emissions of methane from oil and gas drilling on federal land.</P><P>Companies that might be tempted to see the current administration's behavior as an excuse to delay acting on <mark>climate</mark> risks should be cautious—administrations change, and the oil and gas industry in particular is built on investments that require weighting risks decades into the future, said Danielle Fugere, president of <A href=""https://www.asyousow.org/"">As You Sow</A>, a non-profit shareholder advocacy organization. </P><P>&quot;Investors today are becoming more and more sophisticated when they think about a company's <mark>sustainable</mark> future and what that means to their investments,&quot; said <A href=""https://www.asyousow.org/staff/danielle-fugere"">Fugere</A>, whose group <A href=""https://www.proxypreview.org/"">released a report</A> on Thursday with <mark>Sustainable</mark> Investments Institute and Proxy Impact tracking this year's <mark>climate</mark>-related shareholder resolutions. </P><P>&quot;Investments will be made with companies that have a plan for the future; a plan that accounts for a de<mark>carbon</mark>izing economy where companies are making adjustments to remain competitive,&quot; she said.</P><H3>Assessing Risk in a 2-Degree World</H3><P>A block of shareholders led by the Presbyterian Church filed the resolution asking <A href=""https://www.nblenergy.com/"">Noble </A>for an assessment of the impact its portfolios would face from policies and technologies that keep warming under 2 degrees Celsius.</P><P>It's one of at least 18 shareholder resolutions this year calling on oil, gas and electric utility companies to conduct a 2-degree scenario analysis.</P><P>&quot;A 2-degree scenario analysis of Noble Energy's future plans will generate a more complete picture of current and future risks and opportunities than business-as-usual planning,&quot; <A href=""https://tools.ceres.org/resources/tools/resolutions/noble-energy-2-degree-scenario-analysis-2018/@@s3_view"">the church's resolution</A> states. &quot;This report will help Noble identify both vulnerabilities and opportunities for its business and reassure investors that Noble is poised to manage and take advantage of future regulatory, technological and market changes.&quot;</P><P>It would be shortsighted of Noble to make decisions based on the Trump Administration's devotion to fossil fuels, said Rob Fohr, director of <A href=""https://www.presbyterianmission.org/ministries/mrti/"">Faith-Based Investing and Corporate Engagement </A>for the Presbyterian Church.</P><P>&quot;In the short term, I can see where the company has a lot to be excited about,&quot; Fohr said. &quot;But for the long term, it's not prudent to make plans based on the activities of one administration.&quot;</P><P>Shareholders in Kinder Morgan, the largest pipeline and petroleum storage company in North America, are similarly pressing the company for answers about how it is planning for the risks and opportunities presented by goals established by the Paris Agreement.</P><P>The company acknowledged in a <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1506307/000150630717000008/kmi-2016x10k.htm"">2016 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</A> that &quot;greenhouse gas regulations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.&quot; An investor group led by Zevin Asset Management wants to know what <A href=""https://www.kindermorgan.com/"">Kinder Morgan</A> is doing about it.</P><P>&quot;Currently, our company only provides business-as-usual planning and risk analysis, which is not sufficient to prepare for a set of risks as large and complex as <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; <A href=""https://tools.ceres.org/resources/tools/resolutions/kinder-morgan-disclose-direct-and-indirect-lobbying/@@s3_view"">the shareholder resolution</A> states. &quot;The requested report will reassure investors that KMI is poised to manage and take advantage of future regulatory, technological, and market changes.&quot;</P><H3>More Investors – and Companies – Respond</H3><P>Last year, investors in Exxon and Occidental Petroleum Corp. broke through with successful shareholder votes on resolutions seeking annual disclosures that take into account what part of a company's oil and gas portfolio remains economically viable in the face of global efforts to limit global warming. Exxon's shareholders, who had voted down similar resolutions in the past, tipped to <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/31052017/exxon-shareholder-<mark>climate</mark>-change-disclosure-resolution-approved"">62 percent in favor</A> of disclosure.</P><P>&quot;Shareholder engagement has ratcheted up to a new level with enhanced collaborations and strategies, even as some corporate leaders determined to undercut basic shareholder rights have a sympathetic ear in Washington,&quot; Andrew Behar, CEO of As You Sow, wrote in the <A href=""https://www.proxypreview.org/"">report on 2018 shareholder resolutions</A>.</P><P>Under the mounting pressure, <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/05022018/exxon-<mark>climate</mark>-risk-report-oil-reserves-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-goals-electric-vehicles"">Exxon released a report</A> earlier this year addressing the risks the company faces from <mark>climate change</mark> and from government efforts to rein in <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions from fossil fuels, though some shareholders believe it fell short.</P><P>In a presentation to investment analysts Wednesday, Exxon officials discussed their projection for modest efficiency gains and shifts to lower-<mark>carbon</mark> sources over the next two decades—and for continued strong global demand for fossil fuel. &quot;Why keep investing in the oil and gas business?&quot; asked Pete Trelenberg, the company's manager of environmental policy and planning. &quot;Well, because there's demand.&quot;</P><P>Occidental has <A href=""https://www.thestreet.com/story/14421477/1/occidental-to-produce-<mark>climate</mark>-risk-report-in-2018.html"">pledged</A> to also to issue a report on the risks that <mark>climate change</mark> poses to its business no later than June. And other companies, including ConocoPhillips, have voluntarily agreed to perform such assessments.</P><P>In the face of pending resolutions this year, <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/midwestern-utilities-agree-to-<mark>climate</mark>-assessments-949976dd2a68/"">two coal-reliant electric</A> <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/midwestern-utilities-agree-to-<mark>climate</mark>-assessments-949976dd2a68/"">utilities</A> in the Midwest—WEC Energy Group and CMS Energy Corp.—agreed to publish assessments of the long-term business impacts on their companies of limiting global warming to under 2 degrees</P><P>Oil and gas companies in particular face tremendous pressure to accurately identify long-term capital projects that are essential to the growth and prosperity of the business, Fohr said. An oil company that banks on future projects—new oil fields, new refineries—without fully calculating all risk factors puts itself and its investors in jeopardy.</P><P>&quot;A wrong assumption about the future because of one administration's friendly oil and gas position that leads to misallocation of capital puts the company at risk for stranded assets in the future,&quot; Fohr said.</P><H3>Another Worry: Where's the Lobbying Money Going?</H3><P>One of the biggest shareholders demands outside of direct <mark>climate</mark> impact is for more information about companies' political lobbying. Shareholders in at least 11 oil and gas companies and electric utilities want to know how company money is being spent to influence public policy—including on <mark>climate</mark>-related issues, according to the new report and shareholder resolution tracking by <A href=""https://www.ceres.org/"">Ceres</A>.</P><P>The resolutions cite millions of dollars spent by the companies to flex their public policy muscle. <A href=""https://tools.ceres.org/resources/tools/resolutions/disclose-direct-and-indirect-lobbying-2/@@s3_view"">Exxon</A> and <A href=""https://tools.ceres.org/resources/tools/resolutions/disclose-direct-and-indirect-lobbying-1/@@s3_view"">Chevron</A>, for example, spent more than $94 million and $70 million respectively since 2010 on federal lobbying to influence political thinking and public perception, according to the resolutions.</P><P>Some of the resolutions call out companies for financially supporting organization such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the American Petroleum Institute and Koch Groups—all with a history of fighting <mark>climate</mark> policies. The shareholders argue that associating with anti-<mark>climate</mark> organizations damages a company's reputation and could adversely affect stock value.</P><P>If money is spent to purchase influence, it should pay for efforts to promote policies that call for mitigating and adapting to <mark>climate change</mark>, reduce the use of fossil fuels and focus on renewable energy, shareholders wrote in a <A href=""https://tools.ceres.org/resources/tools/resolutions/report-on-public-policy-advocacy-related-to-energy-policy-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change/@@s3_view"">resolution filed with Devon Energy</A>.</P><P>Last year, Devon executives <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090012/000119312517137053/d335277ddef14a.htm#toc335277_70"">told shareholders</A> in recommending a &quot;no&quot; vote on a similar resolution that the company was &quot;committed to conducting our business lawfully, ethically and in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. ... We also believe that participation in the political, legislative and regulatory processes—at all levels of government—is vital to our business.&quot;</P><P>Exxon, in urging a &quot;no&quot; vote on a political spending disclosure resolution last year, <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000119312517122538/d182248ddef14a.htm#toc182248_21"">wrote</A> that its activities &quot;comply fully with the spirit and letter of all federal and state lobby disclosure requirements.&quot;</P><H3>'They Can't Ignore Investors'</H3><P>This year's shareholder resolutions addressing global warming go well beyond fossil fuel companies, cutting across a broad spectrum of businesses that include Apple Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., Lowe's Companies Inc., JP Morgan Chase and Company, and <mark>Ford Motor Com</mark>pany.</P><P>Investors will be paying attention to how much companies drag their feet on <mark>climate</mark> issues, Fugere said.</P><P>&quot;These are sophisticated shareholders who have an interest in a <mark>sustainable</mark> world and investments in companies with stable business models that will protect their investments—and understand that they are related,&quot; she said.</P><P>Natasha Lamb, an executive with Arjuna Capital, which has filed several resolutions on behalf of shareholders in recent years, said investors increasingly recognize the risks. &quot;Now that the broader investment community has taken notice, it's time for companies to accept,&quot; she said.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""tagged-with""><LABEL>Published Under:</LABEL></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

He said, &quot;I do respect this decision but I do think it is an actual mistake both for the U.S. and for our planet.&quot;</P><P>&quot;Wherever we live, whoever we are, we all share the same responsibility: make our planet great again,&quot; Macron added.</P><P>The European Union's top <mark>climate change</mark> official, Miguel Arias Canente, said in a statement that Trump's decision to leave the Paris accord made it &quot;a sad day for the global community,&quot; adding that the bloc &quot;deeply regrets the unilateral decision.&quot;</P><P>Canete also predicted that the EU would seek new alliances from the world's largest economies to the most vulnerable island states, as well as U.S. businesses and individuals supportive of the accord.</P><P>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement &quot;a major disappointment&quot; and said it was &quot;crucial that the United States remains a leader on environmental issues,&quot; according to his spokesman.</P><P>Norway's largest pension fund with 53 billion euro ($59.5 billion) in assets under its management said it would continue to invest in renewable energy despite the American president's decision, saying in a statement that &quot;Donald Trump is jumping off a train that has already left the station.&quot;</P><P>Chief executive Odd Arild Grefstad cited the growth of renewable energy in U.S. states such as Texas, New York and California as signs that &quot;the world has started the transition from fossil to a renewable economy.&quot;</P><P>In Mexico, former President Vicente Fox criticized Trump's move, saying on Twitter: &quot;He's declaring war on the planet itself.&quot;</P><P>Fox, who has clashed with Trump since last year's presidential campaign, said the U.S. leader's decision &quot;condemns this generation and those to come&quot; and would leave &quot;a dark legacy just to satisfy your greediness.&quot;</P><P>Bill Ford, chairman of the <mark>Ford Motor Co.</mark>, also weighed in, saying: &quot;We believe <mark>climate change</mark> is real, and remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities.&quot;</P><P>Before Trump announced his decision Thursday afternoon, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters during a visit to Berlin that fighting global warming was a &quot;global consensus&quot; and an &quot;international responsibility.&quot;</P><P>Without mentioning the U.S. specifically, Li said that &quot;China in recent years has stayed true to its commitment&quot; and pointed out that his was one of the first countries to ratify the 2015 Paris Agreement.</P><P>While traveling abroad last week, Trump was repeatedly pressed to stay in the deal by European leaders and Pope Francis.</P><P>Withdrawing would leave the United States as one of just three countries outside the agreement.

ALEC consists of corporate representatives and over 2,000 state legislators who come together to draft laws that serve conservative political motives and corporate interests at the expense of the public. In essence, ALEC functions as a powerful mega lobby by bringing together multiple corporations and lawmakers in an effort to revise existing laws and propose new legislation through private funding.</P><P>The organization labels itself as non-partisan; however, ALEC’s work on the ground sings a rather different tune than partisan neutrality. Need proof?  Just <A href=""http://www.alec.org"" target=""_blank"" data-wpel-link=""external"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">visit their website</A>. Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson is scheduled as the keynote for their winter meeting in a few weeks. Enough said.</P><P>Among their laundry list of conservative reforms, ALEC has been <A href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gabe-elsner/alec-<mark>climate</mark>-change-denial-attacks-on-<mark>climate</mark>-regulations-and-clean-energy-solutions_b_7012454.html"" target=""_blank"" data-wpel-link=""external"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">actively involved in <mark>climate</mark> denial</A>. <mark>Climate</mark> denial goes above and beyond eschewing the internationally held scientific consensus of the existence of human-induced <mark>climate change</mark>. <mark>Climate</mark> denial encompasses the active blockading and weakening of policy implementations that address the threat of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>ALEC has promoted a number of <mark>climate</mark> denial initiatives including efforts to stop Environmental Protection Agency <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide regulations and the approval of the “Environmental Literacy Improvement Act” which urges states to adopt a “teach both sides” approach to environmental education despite the overwhelming scientific data and generally held consensus of the existence of <mark>climate change</mark>: “Non-partisan” legislation at its finest.</P><P>ALEC also claims that it is “run by and for state legislators.” However, the organization receives 98% of its funding through private entities including global corporations, corporate trade groups, and corporate foundations. A number of corporations have cut ties to ALEC over the past few years due to their conservative agenda and anti-<mark>climate change</mark> position. Google, Coca Cola Company, Yahoo, Walmart, and even Shell Oil have recently rescinded their membership and support of ALEC</P><P>Ford Motors, however, continues to subsidize ALEC through financial grants. Ford spokesperson Christin Baker confirmed that Ford has supported ALEC through grant titles, further explaining that Ford does not intend for those funds be used in favor of ALEC’s platform on <mark>climate</mark> denial. Ford has touted a <A href=""http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2013-14/environment.html"" target=""_blank"" data-wpel-link=""external"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"">company philosophy</A> in favor of a reduced <mark>carbon</mark> footprint—speaking to the seriousness of the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>. They claim to promote both products and operations that offer “green” solutions such as improved vehicle fuel efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions from their manufacturing facilities.</P><P>But is Ford’s enthusiasm for environmental sustainability a sincere company policy or just a crafty marketing strategy? Through Ford’s continued support of ALEC, it seems there is, at the very least, a misalignment of interests. If the car company is to have continued credibility as a corporate proponent of the environment, they should reevaluate their continued funding of ALEC.</P><P>It is time for Ford to put their money where their mouth is.</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><SECTION id=""comment-wrap""><P class=""note""><STRONG> Note: </STRONG><EM> Please keep comments peaceful and family friendly. </EM></P><DIV id=""respond"" class=""comment-respond""><H3 id=""reply-title"" class=""comment-reply-title""><SPAN>Leave a reply</SPAN></H3><FORM action=""https://ladyfreethinker.org/wp-comments-post.php"" method=""post"" id=""commentform"" class=""comment-form""><P class=""comment-notes""><SPAN id=""email-notes"">Your email address will not be published.</SPAN> Required fields are marked <SPAN class=""required"">*</SPAN></P><P class=""comment-form-comment""><LABEL for=""comment"">COMMENT</LABEL></P></FORM></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

			Tell Bill Ford and <mark>Ford Motor Com</mark>pany:
			No U-Turn on Emissions Standards</H3><DIV class=""fordplea""><P>
				It’s simple: If you clean up vehicle emissions, you cut down on <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>. (In a big way!)
			</P><P>
				Transportation is the <EM>largest</EM> source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US. In fact, cars and trucks alone account for over one-quarter of all US emissions. It’s got to change.
			</P><P>
				Americans want it to change. Nearly 90 percent of Americans want automakers to continue to improve fuel economy – leading to less emissions – and support strict government standards, <A href=""https://www.consumerreports.org/fuel-economy-efficiency/survey-finds-consumers-want-better-gas-mileage-stricter-mpg-standards/"" style=""color:#00b3fa;"">according to a recent Consumer Reports survey</A>.
			</P><P>
				The Obama Administration listened and worked with automakers like <mark>Ford Motor Com</mark>pany to develop ambitious but achievable fuel efficiency standards for new cars and trucks that would have prevented 6 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Even better, the standards would have saved American families $1.7 trillion in fuel costs.
			</P><P>
				Ford was part of the solution. But now the company is pulling a U-turn. Ford worked with President Trump and his cabinet of Big Oil insiders to roll back these critical standards.
			</P><P>
				We say no way.
			</P><P><STRONG>Add your name to ask Ford and other automakers to support strong vehicle emissions standards and keep us moving forward in the fight against the <mark>climate</mark> crisis.</STRONG></P></DIV><DIV class=""fordsignup"" style=""color:#ffffff;""><P>

Chicago, Cleveland. We are the last one,&quot; said Guy Williams, CEO of Detroiters Working for Environmental Justice, who introduced six speakers at a presentation of the report at the Northend Christian CDC Campus in Detroit.</P><P>For years Williams has sought business and community support to address the negative impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on Detroit's residents, especially the young, old and poor who are most vulnerable and at risk.</P><P>But it wasn't until 2011, when Williams and Kimberly Hill Knott, the project's director for the Detroit <mark>Climate</mark> Action Collaborative, put together an alliance of scientists that they were able to gather the baseline data and identify the city's environmental and public health issues.</P><P>Scientific collaborators include various departments and agencies within the University of Michigan, Wayne State University and Michigan State University. Business supporters include <mark>Ford Motor Co.</mark>, General Motors Corp., DTE Energy Co., Detroit Salt Co. and Data Driven Detroit.</P><P>&quot;We had so many other distractions in Detroit with the bankruptcy filing and financial problems that slowed us down,&quot; said Williams, who has been working on issues of environmental justice for 22 years. &quot;In the mid-'90s, Mayor Archer was hostile to our movement. He led other mayors nationally to approve a resultion that was a denouncement of environmental justice.&quot;</P><P>In 2017, Mayor Mike Duggan joined 350 other mayors to agree to the principles of the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Accord that call for major reductions in <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and other harmful gases that worsen global warming. Duggan already had created the city's first office of sustainability, focused on improving the economic, social and environmental well-being of city residents and neighborhoods.</P><P>&quot;Detroit has a <mark>climate</mark> action plan,&quot; said Joel Howrani Heeres, Detroit's director of sustainability, adding that the report &quot;lays out an important foundation for the sustainability office&quot; to follow.</P><P>Heeres said goals listed by the Detroit <mark>climate</mark> action report engage residents and businesses to take steps individually and organizationally to improve the environment.</P><P><IFRAME height=""450px"" src=""http://www.crainsdetroit.com/assets/PDF/CD1128591026.PDF"" width=""100%"">This browser does not support PDFs.

Rainfall has steadily increased the past 100 years with the most increases in the fall, he said.</P><P>&quot;It will increase in frequency in Detroit,&quot; Gates said. &quot;We hope to make Detroit a leader in <mark>climate</mark> adaptability and <mark>innovation</mark>.&quot;</P><P>Natalie Sampson, a member of the collaborative and assistant professor of public health at UM-Dearborn, said there is a public health crisis in Detroit with asthma rates up 29 percent.</P><P>&quot;Everyone would benefit from us achieving these recommendations, particularly those most vulnerable. For example, knowing that the mortality rate among senior citizens increases by nearly 18 percent during extreme heat days should motivate us all to act,&quot; Sampson said.</P><P>Dominic DiCicco, a member of the collaborative and Ford's manager of environmental policy, said Ford has been moving for several years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at its manufacturing operations and products.</P><P>&quot;Contributing to a better world has always been a core value at Ford, and our commitment to sustainability is a key part of who we are.

Since 2011, the regulatory targets have applied not to an automaker’s fleet as a whole but to vehicle size, or “footprint.” So the mandates affect size classes rather than entire fleets. The column’s general points still stand. Some of the perverse effects specific to the adjusted mandate are discussed in this <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-14/don-t-just-roll-back-back-fuel-standards-end-them"" target=""_blank"">March 2017 column</A>.</EM></P><P><mark>Ford Motor Co.</mark> plans to largely <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-26/what-would-henry-think-ford-is-about-to-abandon-american-sedans"" target=""_blank"">give up selling cars</A> in North America, focusing instead on trucks and SUVs. The only sedans in its <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/fords-profit-rises-as-auto-maker-reports-progress-on-cost-cuts-1524688854"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">future lineup</A> will be the Mustang and a crossover version of the Focus.</P></DIV></DIV><P>Meanwhile, the Donald Trump administration looks likely to roll back the Corporate Average Fuel Economy targets set by its predecessor’s Environmental Protection Agency. The Barack Obama administration’s CAFE standards require each automaker’s fleet to average 54.5 miles a gallon by 2025. (Carmakers can lower their targets by earning — or buying from their competitors — credits for adopting EPA-approved technologies such as energy-conserving air conditioning or making electric cars.) Environmentalists, and states like California that love them, are up in arms.</P><P>But the administration has a point — if not the courage to do better. CAFE standards are an absurdly indirect way to regulate emissions. And Ford’s decision demonstrates why.</P><P>Consider another energy-sucking invention that Americans love even more than their cars: mobile phones. In an <A href=""https://www.tomsguide.com/us/smartphones-best-battery-life,review-2857.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">independent trial</A> conducted by consumer site Tom’s Guide, the Apple iPhone 8’s battery held its charge for 11 hours, 16 minutes, making it the longest-lasting in the Apple lineup. By contrast, the Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom topped the list at 16 hours, 46 minutes. The iPhone X, which Tom’s Guide has rated the “best phone overall,” scored a <A href=""https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-smartphones,review-2223.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">mere 10 hours, 49 minutes.</A></P><P>Different phones aimed at different consumers offer different features. Different companies pursue different strategies. They make different trade-offs between performance, battery life and cost. A company can offer a full line of phones or specialize. It can sell feature phones with batteries that last for days or souped-up smartphones with fancy screens that gobble power. None of this is controversial. There is no federal law mandating that every company’s lineup of phones average an 18-hour battery life by 2025. That would be ridiculous. Why should Apple change its iPhone designs or sell feature phones just to hit an arbitrary average?</P><P>But that’s exactly what happens with automobiles.</P><P><A href=""https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/corporate-average-fuel-economy"" itemprop=""StoryLink"" itemscope=""itemscope"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">CAFE regulations</A> implicitly assume that every carmaker offers a full assortment of vehicles. Higher average requirements distort corporate strategies and encourage companies that are good at making trucks to make compact cars as well, even if their customers don’t want them. This artificially induced competition, often at giveaway prices, hurts manufacturers that are good at making small cars. The credit system ameliorates this effect by allowing small-car specialists to sell their credits to competitors who produce larger vehicles, but only in a roundabout way.</P><P>In the real world, on real streets, emissions depend not on car dealers’ full offerings but on individual vehicles and the people who drive them. One drawback of CAFE standards is that they apply only to new cars, a tiny fraction of those on the road. So they take a long time to reduce actual emissions. The rest of us happily go on driving our out-of-date vehicles, using just as much gasoline as ever.</P><P>That gets to the second behavioral problem: Better gas mileage encourages people to drive more. CAFE targets are not, in fact, emissions standards. They were established as a response to the oil shocks of the 1970s, not to global warming. They were designed to conserve fuel. In a new, CAFE-approved gas-sipping car, you can go farther for the same amount of money.</P><P>The rules survive because the costs are hidden in corporate income statements rather than being made explicit at the gas pump. CAFE standards tell drivers that emissions are someone else’s problem. But that’s also why they fall short. They give the real decision makers — drivers — no reason to change their behavior.</P><P>It makes perfect sense for Ford to make trucks rather than cars, just as it does for Toyota Motor Corp. to make hybrids. Whether the target is cars or smartphones, however, it makes no sense to dictate a company’s product offering in order to pretend to fight <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><DIV class=""trashline"">(<SPAN itemprop=""description"">Several readers have pointed out that this article, published April 27, uses an outdated description of CAFE standards. Since 2011, the regulatory targets have applied not to an automaker’s fleet as a whole but to vehicle size, or “footprint.” So the mandates affect size classes rather than entire fleets. The column’s general points still stand. Some of the perverse effects specific to the adjusted mandate are discussed in this <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-14/don-t-just-roll-back-back-fuel-standards-end-them"" target=""_blank"">March 2017 column</A>.

The hybrid Prius was a legitimate business home run (2 million sold), and it helped both differentiate Toyota’s brand as the market innovator and propel Toyota to unprecedented profits. But now the company faces renewed competition for the title of green auto leader.</P><P>In the last couple of years, every auto giant has launched alternative vehicles, which they’ve been touting aggressively <A href=""http://gigaom.com/cleantech/detroit-auto-show-7-green-moves-to-watch/"">at the current Detroit Auto Show</A> (see my <A href=""http://<mark>sustainable</mark>lifemedia.com/content/column/strategy/how_the_auto_giants_are_managing_a_paradigm_shift"">newsletter</A> on the different strategies the big companies are pursuing). GM’s “extended range” Chevy Volt and Nissan’s all-electric LEAF are potential blockbusters, with strong early sales and <A href=""http://www.ecogeek.org/automobiles/3398-chevy-volt-is-2011-north-american-car-of-year?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+EcoGeek+%28EcoGeek%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter"">serious buzz</A>.</P><P><STRONG>But I want to focus on Ford.</STRONG> The company <A href=""http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/1935542/ford-unveils-electric-focus-consumer-electronics"">announced its own electric vehicle, the Ford Focus EV</A>, at the recent Consumer Electronics Show.</P><P>Buried beneath the pizzaz of high-profile PR announcements, Ford has developed what appears to be a broad, well-thought-out sustainability strategy.</P><P>As I explored Ford’s <A href=""http://corporate.ford.com/about-ford/sustainability/corporate-sustainability"">fascinating sustainability report</A> (and how often do those words go together?) from last year, I noticed a number of unusual things. So I reached out to Ford’s Director of Sustainability and Environmental policy, John Viera to help me better understand the company’s approach.</P><P>Three key aspects of Ford’s sustainability strategy strike me as critical, and show the company’s real leadership:</P><OL><LI><P><STRONG>It’s based on hard science.</STRONG> Ford’s in-house <mark>climate</mark> scientists – yes, you heard that right — have bought into an important global scientific consensus: humanity must keep <mark>CO2</mark> levels in the atmosphere below 450 parts per million to reduce the odds of catastrophic, species-threatening <mark>climate change</mark> (many leading scientists have since <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>progress.org/2008/03/17/hansen-et-al-must-read-back-to-350-ppm-or-risk-an-ice-free-planet/"">lowered the goal to 350 ppm</A> — and we’ve already hit <A href=""http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/"">390 ppm</A>).</P><P>Ford then worked back from this necessary future reality, determined the share of global emissions coming from Ford products (around 2%), and mapped out the fuel-efficiency levels required to meet the scientific mandate. As Viera said, “I can tell you 5, 10, 20 years from now, where we need to be.” Relying on hard <mark>climate</mark> science to map out non-negotiable boundaries for your products is, to say the least, very unusual.</P></LI><LI><P><STRONG>It tackles both long-term <EM>and</EM> short-term sustainability challenges.</STRONG> Given those science-based plans, Ford is investing in the long-term — the sexy, new EV market that everyone is going after — and rolling out a series of efficiency technologies in the existing, combustion-engine fleet. The 2011 Ford Explorer, for example, is using <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_EcoBoost_engine"">EcoBoost engine</A> technology to <A href=""http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/daily-news/101208-2011-Ford-Explorer-Gets-25-MPG-Ups-Fuel-Economy-25-/"">improve fuel efficiency by 25%</A>. Viera points out that the world may save more fuel between now and 2020 through these incremental improvements than through nascent sales of cleaner cars. “It’s not as glamorous,” Viera says, “but it makes sense number-wise.”</P></LI><LI><P><STRONG>It’s <A href=""http://www.andrewwinston.com/blog/2009/02/whats_your_heresy.php"">heretical</A>.</STRONG> In Ford’s sustainability report, one statement stopped me in my tracks: “By 2050, there will be nine billion people on Earth…Putting nine billion people into private automobiles is neither practical nor desirable.” This is an auto company saying that going after market saturation is not ideal for the company or the world (since cities would cease to function with that much traffic).</P><P>To explore the larger topic of “<mark>sustainable</mark> mobility,” Ford worked on a pilot program in Toronto that encouraged people to use more public transit. Suggesting that people might — and should — use <EM>less</EM> of your product is an aggressive, tight-rope walk of a sustainability strategy. It’s not easy, but it can drive real <mark>innovation</mark> and new thinking, as well as build customer loyalty that maintains or grows market share. (I discussed this idea, and give some examples of companies using this strategy to great advantage, such as Xerox, in my last book, <A href=""http://www.andrewwinston.com/books/"">Green Recovery</A>.)</P></LI></OL><P>Even as they look at mobility more broadly, Ford is still pushing hard on cars of the future. The company is not missing the electric wave. Car guru <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Sexton"">Chelsea Sexton</A>, who knows more about the market for EVs than nearly anyone, says the Focus EV demo seriously impressed her and other influencers. As Sexton told me, “It’s the first time in my life that I’ve lusted after a Ford!”</P><P>In sum, Ford’s sustainability strategy is to pursue a broad portfolio approach, making multiple bets on the future — a stark contrast to competitors that have really bet the farm on one technology. Improving the environmental profile of the current product portfolio while launching new leapfrog products is no doubt a tough balancing act. But it’s very smart. The world is nothing if not uncertain; who can know whether policy, technology, and consumer whims will continue to drive adoption of electric cars?</P><P>Of course, as Sexton reminds me, strategy is one thing, but execution is another. She believes Ford is doing things for all the right reasons, but wonders how well they’ll translate all that smart thinking into market success. In her opinion, the company has been late to the party on communications around electric vehicles (all the heat has been around the Volt and LEAF).</P><P>So will Ford develop — and build great brand stories around — the efficient or electric cars that people want? That’s the billion-dollar question, and it’s where, in this industry, the rubber really does meet the road.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""authors mvl"" js-target=""authors-section""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""content-area--article column""><DIV class=""is-inline-block width-100pct""><P class=""mbn description-text space-for-headshot""><A href=""/search?term=andrew+winston"" class=""font-size-xlarge line-height-tight"">Andrew Winston</A> is the author, most recently, of <A href=""http://www.amazon.com/Big-Pivot-Radically-Practical-Strategies/dp/142216781X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1386963390&amp;sr=1-2""><EM>The Big Pivot</EM>.</A> He is also the co-author of the best-seller <EM><A href=""http://www.amazon.com/Green-Gold-Companies-Environmental-Competitive/dp/0470393742/ref=ed_oe_p"">Green to Gold</A></EM> and the author of <EM><A href=""http://hbr.org/product/green-recovery-get-lean-get-smart-and-emerge-from-/an/13188-HBK-ENG"">Green Recovery</A></EM>.

But is that really what the automaker will be doing in five years? A closer examination of Ford’s discussion with <EM>Fortune</EM> editor Alan Murray provides a few more clues.</P><P><STRONG>A push towards partnerships</STRONG></P><P>The interest in mobility—all the different ways people get around urban and rural areas—has never been higher, particularly around finding ways to reduce traffic congestion. But, as Ford points out, eventually the company will have to monetize and make a business out of these ideas. It’s why he believes there will be more startups working with companies “like ours.”</P><P>“That’s going to be incumbent upon us,” he reflected. “That’s a muscle we haven’t used in many, many years, and we have to be accessible to young companies and know how to work with them.”</P><P><EM><A href=""http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/"">Subscribe to Data Sheet</A>, </EM>Fortune<EM>’s daily newsletter about technology.</EM></P><P>This could mean more cooperation with startups—like its own 2011 partnership with Zipcar—or even an acquisition, such as GM’s recent <A href=""http://fortune.com/2016/03/11/gm-buying-self-driving-tech-startup-for-more-than-1-billion/"">$1 billion purchase of Cruise Automation</A>. Ford is in a position to tap into startup talent. The company backs a startup accelerator called Techstars Mobility, and it has an research and <mark>innovation</mark> lab in Silicon Valley.</P><P><STRONG>A bet on plug-in hybrid electrics</STRONG></P><P>Earlier this year, Ford Motor announced plans to spend $4.5 billion to produce 13 electrified vehicles models. Yet, as the executive chairman noted, there isn’t a great pull for electrification from the customer right now. One look at the numbers, and the challenge to convert to electric is clear. Ford sold 780,354 F-150 trucks in 2015, compared to less than 1,600 Ford Focus electric vehicles.</P><P>So while the company is investing in all-electric vehicles, Ford sees more short-term promise in plug-in hybrid cars, which run on a combination of gas and electric.</P><P>“As a transitional technology plug-in hybrids make a lot of sense,” Ford said. “If you drive in a daily commute, let’s say in San Francisco all week, you could be on your electric battery and never tap into your internal combustion engine.

A 2016 technical assessment by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the California Air Resources Board showed that automakers already were meeting the Obama-era standards faster and more affordably than predicted.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Around the world, in fact, more forward-thinking automakers and countries are pledging to be all-electric within the next dozen years. The days of the internal combustion engine clearly are numbered. Nonetheless, employing the time horizon of fruit flies, the U.S. auto industry refuses to look beyond its short-term profits. Automakers are doing this for one reason only: They know they can make more money by selling gas-guzzling vehicles, and they want to grab all they can, right now.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">They certainly aren’t doing it to satisfy their customers because the standards they previously endorsed are wildly popular with consumers. It’s easy to see why. Once enacted, these standards would save hundreds of billions of dollars at the gas pump while preventing six billion tons of dangerous <mark>climate</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>.

</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P>Yet the big businesses he claims to champion are increasingly choosing to ignore the US president’s sceptical stance on <mark>climate change</mark> and press ahead towards their own environmental goals without him.</P><P>Several of the country’s corporate giants, including Walmart, General Motors, Ford and Mars, appeared this week at the second annual <A href=""http://usa.solve<mark>climate</mark>change.com/index.php"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Companies v <mark>Climate Change</mark></A> conference in Miami to showcase their progress and reinforce their belief that sustainability and other green targets can be achieved irrespective of the policies and purpose of the White House. </P><P>“We were disappointed [the] US pulled out of Paris, but what’s so great is what companies can do to make a difference,” said Zach Freeze, senior director for strategic initiatives in sustainability at Walmart, the first retailer to announce <A draggable=""true"" href=""http://sciencebasedtargets.org/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">science-based targets</A> for emissions reductions and a key signatory to the <A draggable=""true"" href=""https://www.wearestillin.com/us-action-<mark>climate</mark>-change-irreversible"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">We Are Still In</A> declaration that followed Trump’s Paris withdrawal.</P><P>“We all have a lot we can do and should do, it’s becoming more and more of an imperative. We’ve been working on this for a long time, prior to this administration [and] we’re thinking about 10 years from now where we’re going to be. Regardless of what’s happening, this is something we believe in. If we do it the right way we will see progress.”</P><P>Walmart, which claims 260 million customers per week worldwide, and employs 1.4 million workers in the US alone, earlier this year announced its <A href=""https://www.walmartsustainabilityhub.com/project-gigaton"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Project Gigaton</A> initiative that aims to reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions globally by one billion metric tons before 2050.</P><P>Other companies at the conference in Miami – a poignant venue following <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/10/record-storm-surges-and-flooding-feared-in-florida-as-hurricane-irma-hits"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">flooding from Hurricane Irma in September</A> and the threat of <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2017/nov/03/three-degree-world-cities-drowned-global-warming"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">obliteration from sea-level rise</A> within the next century – touted their own achievements in defiance of Trump’s <mark>climate</mark> stance. For example, General Motors’ <A href=""http://www.gm.com/mol/GM-renewable-energy-by-2018.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">purchase of 200 megawatts of wind energy</A> for its Ohio and Illinois plants achieves 20% of its target to use only renewable energy sources by 2050. Confectionery giant Mars, meanwhile, has launched a <A draggable=""true"" href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/06/mars-counters-trumps-<mark>climate</mark>-stance-with-1bn-sustainability-plan"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">$1bn sustainability plan</A>, targeting a 70% reduction in greenhouse gases.</P><P>For Jason Youner, chief executive and founder of Companies v <mark>Climate Change</mark>, it is further proof that green-thinking American businesses are filling the environmental void created by the Trump administration’s cynicism.</P><P>“The corporate sector is not paying heed to the president’s agenda. They’re making all kinds of commitments and they’re putting all kinds of policies in place and changing the way they operate and do business and making a lot of improvements,” he said.</P><P>“The message is one of optimism and hope. The president can only do so much, he’s full of bluster and likes to talk a lot and kind of exaggerates his influence. The companies are seeing they can take the lead and influence what happens on the ground, so there’s hope and optimism. Companies around the world are moving forward and not letting this one rogue administration hold them back.”</P><P>Alana Libow, director of <mark>sustainable</mark> development for Danone, a signatory to We Are Still In and whose Evian bottled water brand business in North America has been certified <mark>carbon</mark> neutral by the <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>trust.com/home/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""><mark>Carbon</mark> Trust</A>, believes companies can turn the political debate to their advantage as their customers and shareholders demand more environmentally friendly practices.</P><P>“It’s an incredible opportunity in an ironic sense, because business always plays a tremendous role in the actions we all take in our social responsibility,” she said. “It only highlights the opportunity and importance for business. Danone was founded on a dual commitment to our shareholders and society, way before we got into the worlds of <mark>sustainable</mark> development, corporate responsibility, being green. It’s a moment of highlight, nothing has changed in our business and we continue moving along and being a leader in the space.”</P><P>Still more can be done by the corporate world, some conference attendees believe. Nicole Labutong, technical manager at CDP, a disclosure and advisory group for businesses, pointed out that only 325 companies from tens of thousands with stated environmental goals had set science-based targets.</P><P>“Science is true whether you believe it or not. It’s up to non-state actors to do their part, say you’re ‘still in’ and make up for governments that might not believe in science,” she said.</P><UL><LI>This article was amended on 1 December 2017 to clarify that Walmart was the first retailer, rather than the first company, to announce science-based targets for emissions reductions.</LI></UL><DIV class=""submeta""><SPAN class=""submeta__label"">Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In doing so, professionals say, those secretaries need to answer questions about how to approach those issues and what kind of filter to apply.
Susan Mac Cormac, partner with Morrison &amp; Foerster and co-chair of the company’s energy and clean technology groups, tells <EM>Corporate Secretary</EM> she thinks of sustainability issues in three ways. The first is as an extension of CSR – a kind of philanthropy involving activities that are not part of a company’s core business but that can be of benefit to the environment or the community. Such activities seldom have board involvement, unless they entail significant expenditures.
The second strand involves the law that has developed over the last five years requiring compliance around supply chains, conflict minerals and – increasingly – ‘integrated reporting’, Mac Cormac observes. This strand of sustainability involves issues on which a company is required to report because they are material to operations and therefore are within the purview of the corporate secretary.
The third area involves how the company’s operations are impacted by ESG issues. ‘And that is core to how the company operates, not the extension of philanthropy and not compliance,’ Mac Cormac points out. In this area – which she calls ‘the meat of the matter’ – the role of the corporate secretary is to determine whether management is focused on the issue, because some aspects of it are operational. The corporate secretary should help the board decide whether it has only an oversight role, or if it needs to take a more active role, Mac Cormac points out: ‘And then you reach the question: if the board has oversight, or active involvement, what does that look like?’
At some firms, management is very active, so the board has an oversight role. But at ‘most companies, management doesn’t fully understand the impacts, and one of the biggest is obviously <mark>climate</mark> risk,’ Mac Cormac notes. <mark>Carbon</mark> emissions are only one part of assessing that risk. For example, some boards need to look at where the company is sourcing materials, and what the odds are that its suppliers will be literally under water or subject to civil unrest in the next 10 years due to <mark>climate change</mark>.
Perhaps counterintuitively, companies that are heavily involved in extraction industries, such as oil, gas and mining firms, are often the most forward thinking in this third area, because sustainability issues are most material to their performance. ‘They see the future,’ Mac Cormac says. ‘And for a lot of them the environmental risks – and also the social risks – associated with their business are real economic risks. So they are some of the most forward thinking in terms of evaluating and making decisions on these risks.’<STRONG>Board engagement</STRONG>
Given these issues, what does good governance look like around sustainability? Veena Ramani, program director of capital market systems at Ceres, writes in a paper for the organization that there are a number of steps boards can take to engage seriously. They can create committees with formal oversight of <mark>climate change</mark> issues to ensure these are properly integrated into decision-making. They can also recruit directors who have expertise and offer training to the members of relevant committees – if not to all board members – and conduct shareholder outreach that focuses on investors. Directors are, after all, fiduciaries to investors, Ramani notes.
By creating <mark>climate</mark> committees, companies can ‘ensure boards oversee how <mark>climate</mark> risks are integrated into operations and decision-making on an ongoing basis,’ Ramani writes, noting that Citigroup, <mark>Ford Motor Com</mark>pany and PG&amp;E have all made <mark>climate change</mark> a focus in their public affairs or sustainability committee charters.
Likewise, in the guidance they offer to companies, both Calpers and Calstrs have encouraged the recruitment of sustainability experts. ‘Companies have to do a better job of disclosing how <mark>climate</mark> trends are affecting corporate strategies and risks that are relevant to investors,’ Ramani writes. ‘We need to know whether boards are prioritizing <mark>climate change</mark> as a material issue.
She tells <EM>Corporate Secretary</EM> that the attitude toward <mark>climate change</mark> and sustainability is comparable with the attitude companies had toward cyber-security a few years ago. Some were proactive in dealing with it, some less so, but there was a dawning realization that industries faced serious disruption to  their business from cyber-threats.
Similarly, companies are now recognizing that <mark>climate</mark> and other sustainability issues can materially impact their performance in both the short and the long term, and this is ‘foreshadowed in a clear and present way’ to shareholders, Ramani says. ‘Disclosure on environmental and social performance is increasingly the expectation rather than the exception.’<STRONG>Director expertise</STRONG>
Mac Cormac, who has worked with Ramani, says board committees can be valuable, but should not give the board a sense of complacency. <mark>Climate</mark> and sustainability issues are so intertwined with the basic operations of some companies that they should be part of board-wide decision-making, she adds. Both Mac Cormac and Ramani say it is crucial for firms to recruit board members who have significant <mark>climate</mark> expertise, pointing to ExxonMobil’s election to its board this year of Susan Avery, a former president and director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. But companies also need to create a structure so the right people and expertise can be heard, Ramani notes.
Mac Cormac says she is starting to see board recruitment aimed at directors who can not only see problems in the sustainability context but also conduct economic analyses to see how these might affect the company, identify factors material to operations and include them in a Form 10K or Form 10Q. The major accounting firms are geared up for this kind of analysis, and companies are hiring them so they can figure out how to measure, benchmark and report on these questions, she adds.
Investor pressure is mounting over sustainability issues. State Street and BlackRock have told corporations in which they have investments that sustainability is a priority. In addition, Ramani says more than 400 shareholder resolutions on <mark>climate change</mark> were filed during the 2016 proxy season. But investor pressure depends to  an extent on transparency.<STRONG>Board engagement</STRONG>
In December 2015 the Financial Stability Board created the Task Force on <mark>Climate</mark>-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which a year later published a consultation paper outlining recommendations for such reporting. Writing in the Guardian last December, Bank of England governor Mark Carney and former New York mayor and TCFD chair Michael Bloomberg said of <mark>climate change</mark>: ‘The challenge is that investors currently don’t have the information they need to respond to these developments… Without the necessary information, market adjustments to <mark>climate change</mark> will be incomplete, late and potentially destabilizing.’
In its paper, the TCFD says companies should identify and disclose the information investors need to price the <mark>climate</mark> risks. Existing standards focus on <mark>climate</mark> information, but they frequently fail to give adequate information on how that information impacts business, it said. President Donald Trump has pulled the US out of the landmark Paris environmental agreement. Tellingly, however, more than 600 firms and investors in January signed a letter urging him to fight <mark>climate change</mark>.
Mac Cormac and Ramani say a rollback of environmental regulation under the Trump administration will only put the onus on boards to act as responsible fiduciaries. ‘The fact that there’s a new administration in town doesn’t mean the risks have gone away,’ Ramani says. ‘In many ways, it means the risks are worse because you don’t have regulation to help manage some of them, and in a situation like this I would actually say the role of the board is more important than ever.’ </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Forward-thinking companies are starting to draw links between <mark>climate change</mark> and other major trends that impact business. <EM><A href=""http://www.wri.org/publication/adapting-for-a-green-economy"">Adapting for a Green Economy</A></EM>, a report released in June 2011 by <A href=""http://www.wri.org/"">WRI</A>, the <A href=""http://www.unglobalcompact.org/"">UN Global Compact</A>, <A href=""http://www.oxfamamerica.org/"">Oxfam</A> and the <A href=""http://www.unep.org/"">UN Environment Programme</A>, showed that many companies recognize <mark>climate change</mark> as a major strategic threat, as well as an opportunity. However, few have been able to design a strategic response or even fully explore how long-term <mark>climate</mark> risks will affect their markets.</P><P>Another recent report, the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project’s <A href=""http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/<mark>climate</mark>/documents/cdp-adaptation-report.pdf"">analysis of FTSE 100 companies</A>, found that nearly 80 percent view <mark>climate change</mark> as a substantive risk to their business. However, less than half of the companies surveyed had incorporated adaptive measures into their overall strategies so far.</P><P>For example, <A href=""http://ophelia.sdsu.edu:8080/ford/03-03-2012/microsites/sustainability-report-2010-11/issues-sustaining-future.html""><mark>Ford Motor Com</mark>pany</A> highlights <mark>climate change</mark> among the big trends shaping its strategy for future markets:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>
Global temperatures may continue to rise unless we stabilize greenhouse gases. Erratic weather patterns may impact water availability. And increasing global populations, coupled with improved standards of living worldwide, will put added strains on natural resources.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>WRI’s work with companies on <mark>climate change</mark> has highlighted a need to turn information and awareness into strategic action and <mark>innovation</mark> (see below). Leading companies recognize that they will need new strategies and partners to effectively respond to <mark>climate change</mark> and other “sustainability megaforces.&quot;</P><H4>Up to the challenge? Contact Us</H4><P>In partnership with companies in the <A href=""http://www.wri.org/nextpractice"">Next Practice Collaborative</A>, WRI is developing a strategic analysis tool to find actionable opportunities to address big trends and environmental challenges. It is designed to help companies recognize links between trends, synthesize insights and find valuable partners.</P><P><STRONG>A new tool will be available for companies to “road test” in early summer 2012.  For more information, contact <A href=""mailto:emetzger@wri.org"">Eliot Metzger</A> at emetzger@wri.org</STRONG>.
</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><H4>Key steps to consider in creating those strategies</H4><H4>Step 1</H4><P><STRONG>Gather and synthesize information.</STRONG> There is a lot of data out there – new reports seem to come out each day with compelling insights about how trends are shaping future markets. Companies need ways to monitor and integrate this information, gathering input from various internal and external experts. Shared insights can inform more robust, long-term, adaptive strategies for <mark>climate change</mark> and other sustainability priorities.</P><P>For example, a business unit in a pharmaceutical company may be thinking about future market needs. It would be valuable to have a means of gathering input from a diverse set colleagues. The business can then benefit from insights not just on basic health trends, but also the implications of growing cities, information technology and logistics, <mark>climate change</mark> (e.g., increasing temperatures, air quality impacts), and related natural resource constraints (e.g., fuel costs, water availability).</P><H4>Step 2</H4><P><STRONG>Recognize threats, opportunities, and uncertainties.</STRONG> <mark>Climate change</mark> affects companies’ long-term business interests through both physical impacts (e.g., sea level rise, increased flood risk) and market impacts (e.g., growing demand for clean energy). As KPMG’s report emphasizes, companies need to think broadly about the external changes and identify <mark>climate</mark> impacts that directly or indirectly shape business risks and opportunities.</P><P>Consider the implications of increasing <mark>climate</mark> variability and <A href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/manishbapna/2012/04/17/3-things-businesses-need-to-know-about-extreme-weather-risks/"">weather extremes</A>. Flooding in Thailand last year shut down production facilities for companies like Western Digital, a manufacturer of disk drives for computers. Other companies like <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/21/us-thailand-floods-tech-idUSTRE79K76Z20111021"">Apple, Dell, and Intel</A>, far removed from the flooding, felt the impacts as shortages and costs rippled through the global supply chain. In addition to risks, companies may also find opportunities to provide or invest in <mark>climate</mark>-resilient infrastructure solutions <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/19/thailand-flood-idUSL3E8CD2U920120119"">to help the region manage future flood risks</A>.</P><P>Similarly, a company may not manufacture solar panels or wind turbines, but it can still find business opportunities with a growing demand for clean energy. Companies like <A href=""http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2012/02/01/why-google-invests-clean-energy"">Google</A> are investing heavily to accelerate <mark>innovation</mark> and deployment of renewable energy, which helps reduce uncertainty for long-term energy supplies (and can provide a healthy return).</P><H4>Step 3</H4><P><STRONG>Find new partners and new ways to collaborate.</STRONG> <mark>Climate change</mark> and other sustainability “megaforces” are bigger than any one company, which means that finding both traditional and non-traditional partners is essential.</P><P>Companies like Ford make efforts to gather input from outside stakeholders and incorporate them into a <A href=""http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2010-11/issues-materiality-matrix"">materiality matrix</A>. Ford is also working with a range of partners that include companies like <A href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/01/07/best-buy-to-sell-fords-electric-charging-stations/"">Best Buy</A> and experts at the <A href=""http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2010-11/issues-sustaining-mobility-partners"">University of Michigan and Georgia Tech</A>. These partnerships have helped the company understand how <mark>climate change</mark> can shape future products, facilities, supply chains and customer needs.</P><P>Creative collaborations like this allow companies to identify and develop actionable strategies to address the long-term threats, opportunities and uncertainties.</P><P>If KPMG’s report is any indication, “sustainability megaforces” will shape how companies build and protect business value for years to come. Companies with innovative strategies and partnerships to tackle the challenges associated with <mark>climate change</mark> will be more resilient and can find opportunities to lead tomorrow’s markets.</P></DIV><DIV class=""field field--field-tags field--supplement""><LABEL class=""field__label"">Tags: </LABEL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The Obama-era regulations would have resulted in the largest U.S. reduction in global warming emissions from a single policy, bringing America’s average fuel economy to 40 mpg by 2020 and 50 mpg by 2025.

                      senior vehicles analyst                        | March 19, 2018, 3:49 pm EDT                    </DIV><DIV class=""article-content""><P>Last month, the Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers <A href=""https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=NHTSA-2017-0069-0176"">submitted a report</A> to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration/Department of Transportation calling into question impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> and tailpipe pollutants in an effort to undercut the need for fuel economy regulation.  <A href=""https://autoalliance.org/"">The Alliance</A> is the trade group for Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, and Toyota, among others.  The report funded by the Alliance was written by industry shills with ties to <A href=""https://www.heartland.org/about-us/who-we-are/joseph-daleo"">the Heartland Institute</A> and <A href=""http://www.airimprovement.com/personnel/dr_george_t_wolff_principal.html"">General Motors</A>, and it flies in the face of automaker claims by the likes of <A href=""https://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2016-17/strategy-governance/strategy/science.html"">Ford</A> and <A href=""https://blog.ucsusa.org/josh-goldman/toyota-cries-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change-while-their-trade-groups-cry-over-<mark>climate</mark>-policy"">Toyota</A> that they are taking <mark>climate change</mark> seriously.</P><H3>Taking a page straight out of the Disinformation Playbook</H3><P>The group the Alliance funded to put together the report has a long history of working against environmental regulations—that’s pretty much their schtick.  <A href=""http://www.airimprovement.com/clients.html"">Past clients</A> include the American Petroleum Institute, the American Coal Council, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Monsanto, the American Enterprise Institute, and, of course, the Alliance.</P><P>The report follows a familiar pattern, generally calling into question the science behind the health impacts of [insert pollutant here], frequently based on a convoluted and biased modeling effort masquerading as science.</P><P>If you’re familiar with the <A href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/center-science-and-democracy/disinformation-playbook"">Disinformation Playbook</A>, then what’s in the Alliance’s paid-for report will sound familiar:</P><DIV style=""max-width: 250px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Automakers are running plays straight out of the Disinformation Playbook in order to try to weaken consumer and environmental protections.</P></DIV><UL><LI><A href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/center-science-and-democracy/disinformation-playbook#playbook-tactic-1"">“The Fake”</A>—The papers cited to support weakening environmental protections are often paid for by industry and/or published in journals with weak peer-review standards and disclosure policies. For example, the Alliance report cites studies by Tony Cox which were directly funded by the American Petroleum Institute in order to cast doubt on the <A href=""https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/risk/recordisplay.cfm?deid=216546"">proven</A> health impacts of soot.  Furthermore, the journals in which the articles were published are known homes for questionable industry-funded research, such as <A href=""https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/02/18/19307/brokers-junk-science"">Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology</A>.</LI><LI><A href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/center-science-and-democracy/disinformation-playbook#playbook-tactic-5"">“The Fix”</A>—Two authors cited by the Alliance (Stanley Young and Tony Cox) are now <A href=""https://www.desmogblog.com/2017/09/01/multiple-industry-funded-nominations-epa-clean-air-advisory-committee"">in advisory roles for the EPA</A> as part of the administration’s move toward <A href=""https://blog.ucsusa.org/elliott-negin/pruitt-scientists-key-advisory-panel"">soliciting their advice from industry-funded scientists</A>. And the Alliance already has strong support within the Department of Transportation for its pitch—Deputy Secretary Jeff Rosen defended GM in liability litigation and <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/stories/67066/print"">fought the EPA’s regulation of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide</A> while at the Office of Management and Budget, and his previous employer (Kirkland and Ellis) <A href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/19/nation/na-preempt19/4"">was employed at least twice</A> by the Alliance in suits to prevent California from regulating global warming emissions from vehicles.</LI><LI><A href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/center-science-and-democracy/disinformation-playbook#playbook-tactic-3"">“The Diversion”</A>—Rather than summarizing the most recent body of research on <A href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/global-warming/science-and-impacts/global-warming-impacts""><mark>climate</mark> impacts</A>, as would be done by anyone genuinely interested in ensuring policy is based on the best science, the report cherry-picks studies to weaken the case for acting on <mark>climate</mark> and reducing emissions from vehicles, either by selecting outliers or misconstruing the findings of the research. For example, the Alliance selected “key points” from a paper on drought variation that seem to diminish the role of <mark>climate change</mark> on drought and flood, ignoring <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/101/12/4136"">the paper’s other findings</A> related to increasing temperatures and a “substantial intensification of the global hydrologic cycle [that] is likely in a warming world.” <A href=""https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2014GL060973"">More recent studies</A> citing this work build upon these ignored findings based on the most current data and find evidence for the increasing role of this temperature trend, including work by <A href=""https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00066.1"">the authors of the cited study</A>.</LI></UL><H3>History repeating itself</H3><P>Part of me is not surprised that the automakers have adopted this strategy to mislead on the science, because it’s a tactic they’ve used in the past time and time again, as I outlined in the UCS report <EM><A href=""http://ucsusa.org/automaker-uturn"">Time for a U-turn</A></EM>:</P><DIV style=""max-width: 250px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">These tactics are par for the course for the Alliance – our report Time for a U-Turn details more than six decades of industry interference with state and federal safeguards, encompassing all facets of protections: fuel economy, safety, and air quality.</P></DIV><UL><LI>1950s: Automakers denied that smog was a problem and colluded to delay deployment of <mark>pollution</mark> controls in an effort to forestall regulation.  They also ran the same play on seatbelts, claiming that “nobody knows” if they save lives despite a decade of definitive research.</LI><LI>1980s: Automakers claimed that there would be no health benefits for stronger <mark>pollution</mark> standards under the Clean Air Act.  This delay of course eventually led to state action and amendments to the Act in 1990 because of the nationwide problem with smog that finally even Congress couldn’t ignore.</LI><LI>1990s: The lead voice for the automakers on revisions to “soot and smog” air quality requirements claimed that a temporary 20 to 30 percent reduction in lung function wasn’t a health effect.  It was also in the 1990s that automakers began their <mark>climate</mark> skepticism, claiming that <mark>climate</mark> models were too uncertain to act upon.  Chrysler CEO Robert Eaton even penned a Washington Post op-ed opposing ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, claiming action on <mark>climate</mark> was “unwise and unnecessary.”</LI></UL><P><A href=""http://ucsusa.org/automaker-uturn"">In our report</A>, we called for the industry to make a U-turn on its behavior, but the sad fact of the matter is that the auto industry does not seem to want to change, and this most recent submission to the government shows us just how much they are still mired in their questionable tactics of old.</P><H3>It’s time for automakers to lead</H3><P>The vehicle efficiency standards set back in 2012 were the result of support from the automakers, who worked closely with regulators to design the regulations.  For an industry with a decades-long history of fighting regulation, this about-face was the result of a harsh confrontation with reality.</P><P>Just before the Great Recession, the Detroit Three had fallen on hard times as a result of neglecting to invest in the efficiency of their passenger car fleet.  When gas prices rose, the companies’ sales and profits dropped like a rock, requiring massive loans.  <A href=""https://usa.streetsblog.org/2011/08/02/after-years-of-resistance-auto-industry-agrees-to-new-mileage-standards/"">In this context</A>, the industry seemed to finally recognize the value in industry-wide efficiency standards that hadn’t been raised in decades.</P><P>Today, however, that leadership is nowhere to be found.  Automakers are urging he current administration to weaken standards, and Pruitt’s EPA and Chao’s DOT seem dead-set to do exactly that.  While <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/greenwire/2018/03/01/stories/1060075183"">suppliers recognize the harm</A> that pulling back on these standards will do to the industry, automakers are stuck in the same mindset that cost the country, and our environment, so deeply in the past.</P><P>Now, not only are automakers trying to weaken the standards—they are calling into question the need for regulations at all.  NHTSA would do well to ignore this rubbish in order to make sure its decisions are best on the best available science, but if automakers like Ford and Toyota truly think that <mark>climate change</mark> needs to be addressed, then it is incumbent upon them to keep their trade association from putting out this kind of anti-science drivel.</P><P>Automakers need to stand up for science and call out this nonsense, or they stand complicit on the side of rhetoric and lies in weakening our environmental protections just to pad their profits.</P><DIV class=""credits-overlay"" data-target="".wp-image-56027""><DIV class=""image-credits""> iStockphoto.com/mccaig</DIV></DIV><P

It is easy to visualize safely cruising down the highway while reading for pleasure or writing a work email—rather than watching the road. Vehicle automation promises to transform how people get to work, run errands, and generally travel through the nation’s streets and highway systems. Children could commute to school alone, without relying on a parent. One can also imagine a sight-impaired person traveling alone to a doctor’s appointment. In cities, someone could hail an autonomous vehicle with a ride-sharing app and ride with other passengers going a similar direction. The idea of driverless robot cars has captured the public’s imagination as automakers and technology companies promote the potential leisure, safety, and environmental benefits of AVs.</P><DIV class=""shortcode newsletter-short col-md-4"" style=""float:right!important; margin-left: 75px;""><H3>Get the Latest on Energy and the Environment</H3></DIV><P>Today, automakers are already adding features to new vehicle models that assist drivers, such as parking assistance, lane centering, and automatic braking. As these features become standard in cars, automakers have set their sights on creating autonomous vehicles that do not need drivers at all. Silicon Valley and ride- and car-sharing companies are investing in technology and betting on the transportation sector’s shift toward autonomous vehicles.</P><P>In the midst of these advances in vehicle technology, the international community is working to address one of the greatest challenges of our time: <mark>climate change</mark>. The United States has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 and to achieving greater emissions reductions in the future.<SUP class=""footnote""><A href=""#fn-292588-1"" id=""fnref-292588-1"" onclick=""return fdfootnote_show(292588)"">1</A></SUP> To meet that goal, the United States will need to cut emissions from the transportation sector, which accounted for 26 percent of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. Of these transportation sector emissions, 61 percent came from light-duty vehicles, such as passenger cars.<SUP class=""footnote""><A href=""#fn-292588-2"" id=""fnref-292588-2"" onclick=""return fdfootnote_show(292588)"">2</A></SUP></P><P>Autonomous vehicles—particularly those that are passenger cars—could significantly affect the country’s ability to cut greenhouse gas emissions and move toward a <mark>carbon</mark>-free economy. Existing studies suggest that three main factors will determine whether putting more AVs on the road increases or decreases tailpipe <mark>carbon</mark> emissions: effect on the total vehicle-miles traveled in the United States; impacts on congestion; and AVs’ fuel efficiency and fossil fuel consumption. As such, autonomous vehicles must be assessed not only for their safety but also for their effect on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions levels.</P><P>To that end, the Center for American Progress reviewed the existing literature on the environmental impacts of automation in the light-duty vehicle sector. We found that existing research does not draw clear and consistent conclusions about the impact of autonomous vehicles on the environment generally and <mark>climate</mark> specifically. In particular, the research reviewed shows that:</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Vehicle miles traveled, or VMT—the </STRONG><STRONG>aggregate number of miles driven by vehicles in a given year—could increase because automation lowers the opportunity cost of driving.</STRONG> This could encourage people to take more car trips or accept longer commutes, since drivers would be able to multitask in vehicles rather than focusing on the road. Additionally, autonomous vehicle technology could allow groups of people currently unable to drive—such as the elderly, young, and people with disabilities—to travel alone in autonomous vehicles, putting more people on the road.</LI><LI><STRONG>VMT could decrease if autonomous vehicle technology is paired with ride- and car-sharing services.</STRONG> A system of shared autonomous vehicles could discourage individual car ownership and use technology to plan efficient routes to transport people from point to point. At the same time, however, shared autonomous vehicles could increase overall VMT if they make frequent passengerless trips to pick up their next client. Specialized software programs could mitigate this effect by planning the most efficient routes.</LI><LI><STRONG>Automation could reduce congestion and make each mile traveled more efficient.</STRONG> Autonomous vehicles that communicate with each other and their surroundings may drive more smoothly, without needing to frequently brake and accelerate. Fully autonomous and connected vehicles could reduce the number of traffic accidents and, therefore, unnecessary idling on roads.</LI><LI><STRONG>Drivers may not realize the congestion benefits of automation for years, until a large share of vehicles on the road are equipped with autonomous technology.</STRONG> In the shorter term, VMT and congestion could worsen as autonomous vehicles join the fleet without displacing traditional vehicles.</LI></UL><P>Automakers and boosters of autonomous vehicle technology argue that autonomous vehicles have the potential to transform the U.S. transportation sector and make it more efficient.

The Center for American Progress offers the following recommendations for additional research on vehicle-miles traveled, travel patterns, and gasoline use in AVs.</P><H4>Impact of gradual adoption on emissions</H4><P>Studies of environmental benefits often assume that every car is fully automated and shared and do not take into account a transition period in which humans still drive some of the vehicles on the road. A transportation system that is fully automated and dominated by car- and ride-sharing services is unlikely to occur for decades. Until that time, the number of vehicles and drivers on the road may increase along with emissions at precisely the time that the United States needs to be bending the emissions curve downward. More research is needed to study the impacts of incremental introduction of AVs to the country’s roadways; how gradual adoption of this technology might affect <mark>carbon</mark> emissions levels from the transportation sector; and how this relates to the country’s need to significantly cut emissions in the short term.</P><H4>Systems-based research</H4><P>More research is needed to understand how AVs will fit within the whole transportation and infrastructure system. In particular, researchers should examine the relative benefits and costs of investment in AVs compared with similar investment in public transit—another option for reducing vehicles on the road and cutting emissions from the transportation sector. Automakers and tech companies are driving the transition to a transportation system reliant on autonomous vehicles, but it is unclear whether that is the most efficient choice from an emissions-reduction perspective. Policymakers need a better understanding of how AVs and public transportation can work together to cut <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> from light-duty vehicles and how policymakers should direct transportation investment in order to achieve the maximum environmental benefit.</P><H4>Travel patterns and driver behavior</H4><P>One major area of uncertainty is the total effect of AVs on VMT. The existing research shows conflicting conclusions about whether AV deployment will reduce or induce travel demand. The challenge lies in the number of assumptions that factor into whether AVs will be a net positive or detriment to the <mark>climate</mark>: whether AVs will add new classes of drivers to the road, remove cars from the road through car-sharing, encourage people to commute from farther distances, or make vehicle-based transportation more efficient. Researchers need to compile more information about how automation would affect the social cost of driving if the driver can do other things, such as work, while traveling and how that would change driver behavior and choices. Overall, researchers do not appear to have the analytical tools needed to model this complex array of assumptions and identify the range of potential outcomes.</P><P>Experts should invest in new modeling capabilities to predict how these factors would interact; this would give policymakers a window into how to avoid potential pitfalls during the transition to an automated transportation system.</P><H4>Electrification of AVs</H4><P>Electrifying the autonomous vehicle fleet would alleviate concerns about new emissions from the transportation sector, assuming that the electricity sector continues to de<mark>carbon</mark>ize. Policymakers and stakeholders would benefit from a deeper understanding of how the electrification of the transportation system—which must happen to achieve the nation’s <mark>climate</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> reduction goals—can proceed in tandem with the automation of vehicles.</P><P>Electrification and automation of the transportation sector could require significant investment in infrastructure to support the new technologies. Further research should uncover what this infrastructure buildout would entail and how policymakers can ensure that it proceeds systematically and efficiently. Technological questions remain as well. For example, additional research may be necessary to examine how combining automation with electrification could affect vehicle performance, including battery life and driving range of EVs.</P><P>Additional consumer research should shed light on how automation supports electrification and vice versa. Researchers, for example, could build on existing studies suggesting that consumers may be more accepting of electric vehicles if they are autonomous—and therefore able to fuel themselves. This could give policymakers new insight into how to design better incentives to expedite the electrification of the transportation sector.</P><H4>Data collection and sharing</H4><P>The National Association of City Transportation Officials, or NACTO, has recommended some areas of analysis needed to improve the quality, quantity, and sharing of traffic data. They suggest directing federal and state funds to research on city operations of shared autonomous electric vehicles, as city streets require algorithms to address the most complex problems inhibiting smooth driving. Research in this arena should focus on what city infrastructure is needed to facilitate driving with traits that would enhance car-sharing, as well as efficient driving to reduce emissions.<SUP class=""footnote""><A href=""#fn-292588-94"" id=""fnref-292588-94"" onclick=""return fdfootnote_show(292588)"">94</A></SUP></P><P>NACTO also recommends implementing a modeling exercise similar to a study performed in Lisbon, Portugal, by the International Transport Forum in 2015.

                            <mark>Ford Motor Co.</mark> has announced that it will invest $11bn (£8bn) in developing electric and hybrid cars over the next five years.
                        </P><DIV class=""body-content""><P>The announcement was made by Bill Ford, Ford chairman, at the Detroit Motor Show.</P><P>“This $11bn you’re seeing, that means we’re all in now,” he said at the event. “We’re taking our mainstream vehicles, our most iconic vehicles, and we’re electrifying them. If we want to be successful with electrification, we have to do it with vehicles that are already popular.”</P><P>“The only question is: will the customers be there with us? And we think they will.”</P><P>Ford aims to have 40 new electric and hybrid models on the market by 2022, including 16 fully electric cars, and at least one high-performance SUV, nicknamed the ‘Mach 1’. The company also aims to introduce a hybrid version of its iconic F-150 truck by 2020.</P><P>Last year, Ford replaced Mark Fields as president and CEO with Jim Hackett. During his time at Ford, Hackett oversaw the creation of Ford Smart Mobility, self-ventures, and other forward-facing projects which could help the well-established automaker compete with Tesla, Uber and other younger companies breaking into the automotive industry with electric and self-driving ventures.</P><P>In October 2017, Hackett announced that Ford would shift investment towards trucks and electric and hybrid cars and away from the development of new internal combustion engines and sedans.</P><P>Previously, the company has stated that it intended to invest $4.5bn (£3.3bn) by 2020. This announcement approximately doubles its planned investment, although the investment is significantly smaller than Volkswagen’s planned $40bn (£29bn) investment in cleaner models.</P><P>Government and companies around the world are searching for means to cut down their <mark>carbon</mark> emissions as the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> – such as more frequent instances of extreme weather – demonstrate the necessity for mitigation. The 2015 Paris Agreement – whose signatories include every country in the world <A href=""/content/articles/2017/06/trump-exits-paris-agreement-musk-leaves-advisory-board-mixed-response-from-us-companies/"">except the US</A> – aims to limit average global temperature increases to 2°C, which could help avoid the most devastating effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>A shift away from petrol and diesel vehicles to electric and hybrid vehicles could significantly help limit <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. The French and <A href=""/content/articles/2017/07/petrol-and-diesel-cars-to-be-banned-in-the-uk-from-2040/"">UK governments</A> have announced their intentions to ban sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2040.

<BODY><MAIN id=""wb-cont"" role=""main"" property=""mainContentOfPage"" class=""container""><OL><LI>Smart Grids; and,</LI><LI><mark>Carbon</mark> Capture.</LI></OL><P>CCMT technologies related to Transport are designed primarily to help reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions.  Technologies related to electric vehicles are a typical example of CCMT technologies related to Transport.  Renewable Energy includes technologies in areas such as hydro energy, wind energy, solar energy and geothermal energy.  In Buildings, emission reductions are gained through better lighting, heating, ventilation systems as well as better elevators, escalators and increased thermal performance in general.    Traditional Energy includes improvements in fossil-fuel technologies and alternatives such as nuclear energy.  Clean Energy Enablers are technologies related to energy conversion or management systems that are also designed to reduce greenhouse gases.  Technologies related to batteries are example of technologies that would fall under this category as batteries are considered an alternative to using other types of energies that are more polluting.  Smart Grids are related to the imporvement of technologies related to an electrical supply network using digital communication technology.  Using communication technologies to optimize electricity usage ultimately empowers consumers to more effictiently control energy use thereby reducing the likelihood of outages. <SUP id=""fn13-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn13""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>13</A></SUP> Finally, <mark>Carbon</mark> Capture related technologies are designed to capture waste CO<SUB>2</SUB> and other greenhouse gases and inject it into deep underground rock formations for permanent storage. <SUP id=""fn14-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn14""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>14</A></SUP></P><P>The Canadian researcher data used in this report was obtained from Antoine Dechezleprêtre, Associate Professorial Research Fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the Environment at the London School of Economics, and co-author of the UNEP and EPO report.  The analysis focuses on patent applications filed between January 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2012.  The dataset consists of 7,873 high-value invention (HVI) patent applications with at least one Canadian researcher filed over the time span translating into 2,184 HVI patent families.  A patent family represents one or more published patents related to the same invention with a shared priority.  This report uses the same fractional counting approach as in the UNEP and EPO report for assigning patented inventions to inventors in cases where multiple inventors from various countries jointly filed a patent.  Using the fractional counting approach, the 2,184 HVI patent families equates to 608 HVI patent families.  This approach uses information on the inventor's country of residence or origin to determine in which country a patented invention has been developed.  For example,  in the case where a patent is filed by a Canadian, an American, and a Japanese inventor, Canada would be assigned one third of the ownership of the patent, the United States would also retain one third of the ownership, and Japan would retain the final third of the ownership.</P><P>In addition to examining CCMT patenting activity by researchers, this report examines the CCMT patent data from the perspective of business inventive activity.  The Derwent <mark>Innovation</mark> database was used to extract patent families that were filed in more than one country and where the basic patent, or the first member of the patent family, was filed between 2008 and 2012.  We refer to these patent families as high-value inventions.  The dataset consists of 99,935 high-value inventions in CCMT.  The Canadian businesses dataset represents approximately 1%, or 1,140 high-value inventions, of the total number of patent families worlwide involved in CCMT.  This is approximately half the size of the Canadian researcher dataset.  Similar to the researcher data, the business data is limited to patent filed between January 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2012.  An absolute counting approach is used to assess the patented inventions to businesses.  The reason for not using the fractional counting approach for the business analysis is because the IP is associated with the company's country of origin based on its headquarter's location.</P><P>Time was spent treating the data to ensure that proper country codes were attributed to businesses. This is due to cases of missing address information as reported by the office where the basic patent was applied. Treatment included creating a database of business names from the dataset and attributing a country code to those businesses that were without a country code but that have already appeared somewhere in the dataset with one.  In doing so, the percentage of businesses without an address dropped from 5% to less than 1%.</P><H2 id=""toc-5"">Methodology</H2><H3>Patent analytics</H3><P>The development and adoption of new technologies are required to meet current and future environmental challenges. <SUP id=""fn15-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn15""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>15</A></SUP> Patent data is a good starting point for analysis of the development of new technologies as it provides important information on the specific <mark>innovation</mark> in the invention and who the inventors and applicant are.  Like any data source patent data has its strengths and weaknesses and if used in the wrong way it can lead to erroneous conclusions and poor policy.  The following provides context on the use of patents in understanding <mark>innovation</mark>.</P><P>While patents measure the flow of new ideas, it has been argued that patents may not measure <mark>innovation</mark> for three important reasons: patents do not include non-patented <mark>innovation</mark>s, not all patents result in commercialization, and many patents are strategic in nature. <SUP id=""fn16-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn16""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>16</A></SUP> For this reason the analysis is based on patent families that include applications in at least two jurisdictions.  This makes it more likely that these patent families will be a higher-valued invention and that the firm expects to commercialize the invention. <SUP id=""fn17-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn17""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>17</A></SUP></P><P>Another challenge presented is that many <mark>innovation</mark>s or inventions remain hidden as trade secrets.  These <mark>innovation</mark>s will be missed in a measure that includes only patents.  However, a 2008 study indicates that world-first innovators patent more frequently. Conversely, firms that patent infrequently tend to be imitators. <SUP id=""fn18-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn18""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>18</A></SUP> In addition, the study finds that firms that protect their intellectual property are more likely to increase their profits than those that do not.  In addition, SMEs that patent are more likely to be high-growth firms, which is important for success. <SUP id=""fn19-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn19""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>19</A></SUP> These conclusions are reinforced by a Canadian study that noted that firms that are aggressive innovators, introducing radically new products that involve patent protection, have higher profits. <SUP id=""fn20-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn20""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>20</A></SUP> Finally, while some inventions are not patented, patents are obtained for almost all economically significant inventions. <SUP id=""fn21-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn21""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>21</A></SUP></P><P>Below are the primary ways to view or interpret patent data:</P><DL><DT><STRONG>Market Reach</STRONG></DT><DD>Patent filings in foreign markets are a good indicator of firms accessing those markets.  Surveys have shown that firms that hold patents are more likely to be exporters <SUP id=""fn22-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn22""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>22</A></SUP> .</DD><DT><STRONG>Innovative Activity</STRONG></DT><DD>When we do not account for filings in multiple jurisdictions we are double and triple counting the number of patented inventions or innovative activities.  In order to address this patent data allows for the formation of patent families where by each family includes all related or similar patents in all jurisdictions.</DD><DT><STRONG>Scientific Strength</STRONG></DT><DD>It is possible to identify the researchers or scientists, rather than the company or applicant.  While these can be the same, they are often different.  In this way we can see the inventive activity of Canadian researchers working in other countries or for non-Canadian companies.</DD><DT><STRONG>Relative Advantage</STRONG></DT><DD>Canada is a small open-economy.  For this reason it is unlikely that our industries or innovators would have an absolute advantage in a particular area, be the most prolific IP users or have the largest global market share.  However, there are areas where we have a comparative or relative advantage.  Much work has been done in the creation of metrics of relative technological advantage and relative specialization.</DD></DL><H3>Patent families</H3><P>The analysis of businesses and institutions is based on Derwent <mark>Innovation</mark>'s patent family data. These families are defined as drawing together patents covering the same invention and their relationship is defined by the priority or application details claimed by each document.  A patent family can be tagged to multiple classifications.  For this reason, it is important to note that when we say patent, we actually mean a patent linked to the specific classification regardless of if it was tagged to another one.</P><P>Similar to the EPO report, the patent family data in this report was used to construct statistics for &quot;high-value&quot; inventions.  High-value inventions are defined as patent families that are filed in more than one jurisdiction.  Although it can be said that patents are not all of high-value, it is rare to find that a successful invention was not patented.  This idea along with our methodology for using only patent families filed in more than one jurisdiction justifies our assumption that the patents in our datasets are high-value inventions.  Although it is very difficult to quickly identify the value of patents within a large dataset, it is a safe assumption that patents filed in multiple jurisdictions are likely to be of higher value than patents filed in only one jurisdiction.  By omitting patents filed in only one jurisdiction from the dataset, it was possible to limit the dataset to high-value inventions.</P><H3>Revealed technological advantage</H3><P>In order to gain a better understanding of Canada's strengths in CCMT research, we use the Revealed Technological Advantage (RTA) index, which was developed by the OECD and uses patenting intensity to allow for industries to be compared between countries of different sizes on a relative basis.  The index is calculated as a correction for the absolute numbers of HVI patent families in order to account for the fact that some countries file more patent applications than others in all fields of technology.  In this report the RTA index is used to determine where Canadians have a comparative advantage over competitors.  This report compares Canada's RTA index for each CCMT category to that of the G7 countries along with four other countries, China, Korea, Australia and Denmark.  China and Korea are included in the comparison because they are two prolific patenting countries.   Australia is also included because of its IPO's similarities with the Canadian IPO in terms of size and activity levels.  Finally, Denmark is included because of its specialization in the area of CCMT.</P><P>The formula used to calculate the RTA is as follows:</P><DL><DT><STRONG>Numerator</STRONG></DT><DD>The sum of HVI patent families for a category (or subgroup) in Canada divided by the sum of HVI patent families for the category (or subgroup) in the world</DD><DT><STRONG>Denominator</STRONG></DT><DD>The sum of HVI patent families in Canada divided by the sum of HVI patent families in the world

The weather cooperated, not to make the marchers more comfortable, but to make a point. It was 100 degrees, a sign of what we might to expect in the future. Weavers Way’s Environment Committee was well represented with half a dozen of us plus three family members. It felt good to know that so many people cared enough to walk in the sun on a very hot day to let the world know <mark>climate change</mark> is real. We hoped some of the world was listening. The next day, there was a photo in the New York Times, but no story.</P><P>The march was preceded by a rally City Hall Courtyard. The first speaker was City Councilwoman Helen Gym, who declared, “Our cities and our elected officials can no longer continue to sleepwalk their way through a <mark>climate</mark> crisis of gargantuan proportions that threatens not only our future, but our current way of life.”</P><P>Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food &amp; Water Watch, also spoke, noting that when the organization first called for a ban on fracking, “it was viewed as a really marginal issue, but our movement has expanded dramatically and has become mainstream. . . . Today, more Americans oppose fracking than support it.” The final speaker at City Hall was Laura Zuniga Cáceres, the daughter of murdered Honduran activist Berta Cáceres. Sharing a quote from her mother, Cáceres exhorted in Spanish, “Wake up, humanity! Time is running out!”</P><P>The marchers then slowly made their way toward Independence Hall, armed with colorful and dramatic signs, banners and costumes. Food &amp; Water Watch provided large containers of water at two locations. A small group of police on bicycles were riding next to us. I asked each officer if he or she needed water. Each smiled and declined but seemed appreciative.</P><P>The march paused in front of the Marriott Hotel, probably to catch the attention of DNC delegates who might be staying there. We wanted our presence known.</P><P>Most of the signs referred to <mark>climate change</mark>, banning fracking and promoting <mark>sustainable</mark> energy. Attention was drawn to the impact of fossil-fuel extraction on rural and poorer communities. A group of indigenous people walked together and sprinkled the crowd with healing herbs, and at Independence Hall, members of the Ramapo Lenape Nation from North Jersey, who have battled Ford Motors over the toxic Ringwood Mines landfill, led a prayer. </P><P>Activist and Cornell biology professor Sandra Steingraber was another speaker at Independence Hall. She is the author of “Living Downstream,” about toxins in her community in Illinois and her resulting cancer, and “Raising Elijah: Protecting Children in an Age of Environmental Crisis.” I highly recommend both books. </P><P>Afterward, those of us from the Environment Committee walked back to the train station to return home. None of us drove to the march, of course! </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Ford, he pledged, would <A href=""http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06EFD7163DF93BA15754C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1"" target=""_blank"">boost</A> the fuel economy of its <FONT class=""acronym_smallcaps"">suv</FONT>s by 25 percent within five years. Reporters scribbled furiously as Nasser spoke; this was not the sort of thing anyone in Detroit went around promising, least of all America’s most iconic automaker, flush with profits from its big trucks and <FONT class=""acronym_smallcaps"">suv</FONT>s and a recent victory putting the kibosh on tougher federal mileage standards.</P></DIV><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">Then again, no other company had a chairman quite like William Clay Ford Jr. A self-described environmentalist, Bill Ford was fighting a dramatic battle to transform his great-grandfather’s company into a model of sustainability. (Full disclosure: I was a Ford media liaison for six months in 2000.) Unlike other auto execs, he acknowledged the problem of global <mark>climate change</mark> and his industry’s role in it. He drove an electric Ford Ranger truck and successfully launched a $2 billion renovation that made the company’s <A href=""http://www.hfmgv.org/rouge/index.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Rouge</A> assembly plant one of the industry’s greenest. He talked up fuel efficiency and promised to expand hybrid production. “There is a rising tide of environmental awareness and activism among consumers that is going to swell to undreamed-of heights in the 21st century,” Ford told <A href=""http://www.automobilemag.com/index.html"" target=""_blank""><EM>Automotive News</EM></A> after being named chairman-elect in September 1998. “Smart companies will get ahead of that wave, and ride it to success and prosperity. Those that don’t are headed for a wipeout.”</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">But if outsiders were impressed with Nasser’s “25 by 5” announcement, many within the company saw the project as <FONT class=""acronym_smallcaps"">doa</FONT>. Jim Schroer, then Ford’s global marketing chief, had first heard about it two months earlier at an executive test-drive of a prototype tricked out for fuel efficiency. “I’m sitting there, and I think, ‘Oh boy, that’s not going to happen,'” he recalls. Sure, Ford knew what it would take—the necessary technologies, such as ultralight <mark>carbon</mark>-fiber parts and advanced electronics, had all been tested by its labs—but adding those features would cost more, and Schroer didn’t think American consumers would put up with that. “By anybody’s financial present-value calculation, you’d be crazy to do it,” he says.</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">In hindsight, of course, it seems Ford was crazy not to. As Schroer predicted, Nasser’s pledge fizzled due to its price tag, and despite a decade of environmental prophesying by its chairman, the <mark>Ford Motor Com</mark>pany is only now beginning to view matters like fuel efficiency as business imperatives. In July, battered by soaring gas prices and plummeting sales, Ford announced that it would slash production of the trucks that have been its lifeblood—from half of its vehicles today (and 70 percent in 2005) to about one-third by 2012. To replace them, it will adopt a number of its small European models, some to be assembled in plants that once built the F-Series trucks, until recently the nation’s top-selling vehicles. Alan Mulally, Ford’s current <FONT class=""acronym_smallcaps"">ceo</FONT>, will also speed up launch of the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrids, and double overall hybrid production to 50,000 units in 2009—impressive until you consider that it represents less than 2 percent of Ford’s 2007 US sales.</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">Is it too little, too late? “They did squander an opportunity,” says Mindy Lubber, president of <A href=""http://www.ceres.org/"" target=""_blank"">Ceres</A>, a green-business coalition of which Ford is a member. “If the company had followed what [Bill Ford] wanted they wouldn’t have had to make these changes in the 11th hour. They could have been out there in front. They could have gained market share.”</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">But what happened at Ford is more than just a Wall Street campfire story. Perhaps no other company so embodies the difficulties America faces as we confront a growing energy crisis and the urgent reality of <mark>climate change</mark>. If a well-intentioned leader whose family owns 40 percent of the company’s voting stock can’t make lasting changes, then who can? Change is an easy sell when a company is in free fall, but overcoming marketplace myopia during better times requires long-term vision, a strategic business plan, and the ability to sell them both—not only to consumers, but to corporate stakeholders, whether gas costs $5 a gallon or 89 cents.</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;""><FONT class=""acronym_smallcaps"" style=""color: #990000;"">A gallon of regular</FONT>, in fact, was retailing for less than a buck when Bill Ford began his term as chairman in January 1999. Ford trucks were selling like mad, and the company was on an acquisition binge. During the chairman’s first year, Ford hauled in more money than any car company ever had: a $7.2 billion profit on sales of $163 billion. Its 25 percent US market share put Ford within reach of <A href=""http://www.gm.com/"" target=""_blank"">General Motors</A>, the world’s top vehicle manufacturer. (Earlier this year, Ford’s market share fell to around 15 percent, putting it well behind Toyota.)</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">In theory, the gangbuster sales should have given executives leeway to experiment. Bill Ford also had Nasser, a president and <FONT class=""acronym_smallcaps"">ceo</FONT> 10 years his senior with the clout to implement his vision. Former company executives say there’s a reason Nasser, not Ford, announced the fuel-economy initiative: “Nobody dared defy him,” one of them recalls. “Nobody was afraid of Bill Ford.”</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">Indeed, nearly everyone I spoke with—from auto executives and industry analysts to environmentalists and activist shareholders—agreed that no matter his personal convictions, Bill Ford had neither the operational skills nor the management talent to make his green aspirations a reality. Instead, the chairman tried to tack environmental changes onto a business model focused obsessively on bigger, badder trucks—Built Ford Tough. “Bill is a very idealistic guy, very principled,” says David Cole, chair of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and a longtime informal adviser to Ford and other automakers. “But he was relatively young and he had never been in the trenches. Now all of a sudden he is captain of a ship and he hadn’t been in the engine room…Ultimately, that kept his wish from being fulfilled.”</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">The company also had serious organizational problems. Many of its plants were inflexible, designed to make just one type of vehicle. And Ford <FONT class=""acronym_smallcaps"">usa</FONT>, while still profitable, was an island in an increasingly globalized world. Toyota and other rivals were able to build vehicles that sold anywhere, but Ford operations in North America, Europe, Asia, and South America shared little more than a logo. Even that was contentious, Schroer recalls. “It took two years to agree that we should use the same Ford oval for the planet. That’s how separatist it was.”</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">To compete, the company needed to collapse its far-flung operations into a single, global company. This would have allowed Ford to bring fuel-efficient models to the US market far more quickly and spread efficiency technologies across its product lines, reducing the unit cost and giving its chairman a better business case for his vision. But it didn’t happen.</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">Nasser and Ford (both men declined to be interviewed for this article) treated one another respectfully, according to those who worked with them, but they clashed over the company’s direction. Nasser saw himself as a corporate change maker on the order of GE’s Jack Welch. He wanted a Ford built on brands and responsive to consumer desires, which in his world meant nifty electronics like navigation systems and satellite radio, and a hip aesthetic; he promoted J Mays, designer of Volkswagen’s popular Beetle remake, to give new life to the brand. (Slogan for Ford’s new Flex, an <FONT class=""acronym_smallcaps"">suv</FONT>-like seven-seater: “For people in search of stimulation.”) Far from integrating Ford’s global operations, Nasser further balkanized them, buying up Sweden’s Volvo and the British Land Rover. On his watch, the company even branched out into e-commerce, junkyards, and auto-repair shops.</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">As Nasser barreled ahead, Bill Ford neither constrained him nor did he put forward his own viable business plan. “He didn’t have their respect,” one former executive says of Ford. “He’s the name on the building…He never had the business credibility with the decision makers for them to ever take him seriously.”</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;""><FONT class=""acronym_smallcaps"" style=""color: #990000;"">Bill ford’s</FONT>—indeed, the company’s—greatest environmental accomplishment has been the Rouge factory overhaul. The rebuilt plant has one of the world’s <A href=""http://www.hfmgv.org/rouge/leedlivingroof.aspx"" target=""_blank"">largest living roofs</A>, plus solar cells and skylights to reduce lighting costs. Rouge now serves as a benchmark for Ford’s other factories; overall the automaker has reduced energy use by 30 percent and trimmed emissions from its manufacturing facilities by 39 percent since 2000, boasts John Viera, the company’s director of <mark>sustainable</mark> business strategies. However, as Jennifer Krill of the <A href=""http://ran.org/"" target=""_blank"">Rainforest Action Network</A> points out, “They are still building F-150s under that green roof.” Indeed, on the product end, top executives viewed their chairman’s vision as a “nice thing to do,” according to one insider—not as a must-have for the company’s future.</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">“The premise of what Bill Ford did, and it tends to be the premise that a lot of corporate environmentalists take, comes from a kind of noblesse oblige approach. It’s about what we will deign to do,” says John DeCicco, a senior fellow with the <A href=""http://www.edf.org/"" target=""_blank"">Environmental Defense Fund</A> who has long been involved with automotive issues. “The ’25 by 5′ pledge is a very instructive story because it really points out the inability of the individual corporate actor to go in a different direction from where the competitive marketplace wants to go.”</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">In fact, when Nasser announced Ford’s fuel-economy plan, environmentalists wondered whether the company had even considered how it would pull it off. “What they always said to me is, ‘Look, we chose a goal somewhat arbitrarily in order to please people like you,'” says Dan Becker, former director of the Sierra Club’s <A href=""http://www.sierraclub.org/energy/"" target=""_blank"">global warming program</A>, who attended Nasser’s National Press Club speech.</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">“Bottom line,” says Viera, who back then was a chief engineer on Ford’s Ranger pickup, “the cost of the technologies at that point wasn’t aligned with the price the customer was willing to pay. So we didn’t have any business case at all.”</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">There was indeed a business case. It just happened to be a long-term one. But even if top executives had been listening, a series of crises kept them distracted, allowing competitors to take the lead in fuel efficiency and global strategy alike. First came the <A href=""/news/outfront/2001/05/firestone.html"" target=""_blank"">Firestone</A> tire fiasco of 2000; next was 9/11, which hit the industry hard. Seven weeks later, with Ford on track to lose $5.5 billion, the board fired Nasser. Bill Ford himself took over as chief executive just as Nasser’s late-1990s acquisitions and the company’s global shortcomings began to cause major problems. “Fires were raging everywhere,” Ford later told <A href=""http://www.newsweek.com/id/56058"" target=""_blank""><EM>Newsweek</EM></A>.</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">Lacking clear direction, Ford <FONT class=""acronym_smallcaps"">usa</FONT> reverted to what it knew best: making and selling powerful trucks, which made the company profitable for a couple more years. But the writing was on the wall. Ford’s Escape Hybrid <FONT class=""acronym_smallcaps"">suv</FONT> didn’t hit the market until 2004, five years after Honda’s Insight first appeared on US dealers’ lots. And while Toyota has been selling hybrid cars in the US for almost a decade, Ford won’t have its first one on the market until 2009. Ford didn’t even have much of a conventional small-car business to fall back on when US consumers pulled a U-turn.</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">By 2006, Bill Ford was desperate, admitting to auto consultant Cole that “I’m over my head.” And he was. The company lost $12.7 billion that year, its biggest hit ever, and Ford was looking to cut tens of thousands of workers.</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">That September, Ford reached outside the company to hire Alan Mulally, then a top Boeing exec, as the new <FONT class=""acronym_smallcaps"">ceo</FONT>. Since coming on board, Mulally has overhauled corporate structure, integrated global operations, and accelerated plans to bring over small cars from Europe. The Fiesta and five other models, some smaller than the Ford Focus, will hit US roads by the end of 2012; in the interim, the company expects to bleed more cash, adding to its nearly $23 billion in losses over the past two years. Ford doesn’t predict a return to profitability until after the small cars start rolling out in America.</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;""><FONT class=""acronym_smallcaps"" style=""color: #990000;"">Publicly</FONT>, Bill Ford pinned his failure on consumer behavior. The market had demanded bigger and bigger vehicles despite his warnings, so that’s what Ford provided. “Gasoline prices were cheap,” he recently told a columnist for <A href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_32/b4095018293942.htm"" target=""_blank""><EM>Business Week</EM></A>, “and customers were buying many more of our big F-150s than they were of our Escape hybrids. Now everyone’s aligned behind this [fuel-efficiency] vision.”</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">The subtext, of course, is that public companies are slaves to short-term consumer demand. “The conventional wisdom of financials never, ever directs you to investments that pay off in years five through ten,” notes Schroer, Ford’s former marketing chief. “Would it be the economically rational thing to bring small cars here years ago? Hell no, not when every one you bring over here is less profitable than selling a big truck.”</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">Indeed, selling Priuses in the US was a money-losing proposition for Toyota at first—but now the Japanese carmaker is reaping the benefits. “I don’t see any evidence that any of the companies are motivated by environmental goals,” says Dan Becker, who now runs the Safe <mark>Climate</mark> Campaign. “I don’t see it in Honda, and I don’t think Toyota does it either.” But when these companies look at their bottom lines, Becker adds, they see the need to invest for the long term.</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">Mulally has given sustainability top billing in the Ford hierarchy, promoting a senior vice president to oversee it, and Viera leads a four-person corporate sustainability team. That Ford plucked him, a truck guy, to handle the new push, Viera says, shows that the company is getting serious. “My previous 22-plus years were all on the product-development side, from trucks [to] large <FONT class=""acronym_smallcaps"">suv</FONT>s,” he says. “I’ve had a lot of experience driving concepts into production and into reality.” He’s also well aware of the pitfalls.</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">Ford’s most recent sustainability report lays out a blueprint for reducing its new cars’ CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions by 30 percent in Europe and the US by 2020. This will require increasing fuel economy by 40 percent to 35 mpg, a target identical to the one Congress mandated last year. Viera insists that Ford set its goals before the bill was passed. “<mark>Climate</mark> stabilization: That is how we set our target,” he says. Environmentalists, burned by Ford’s past broken promises, remain skeptical. “Why should we believe anything Ford tells us?” asks Becker, summarizing the attitude of green groups in the wake of the “25 by 5” debacle.</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">Ford’s blueprint did quiet activist shareholders who were demanding that the company disclose how it planned to reach the congressional mandate. They wanted more than just promises, Viera notes as he flips through charts outlining Ford’s goals for the short term (fewer trucks, smaller engines, better transmissions), medium term (plug-in hybrids), and long term (fuel-cell vehicles and other experimental technologies).</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">Viera says the rapid changes in consumer demand have already put the blueprint on a fast track; “<A href=""http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=27455"" target=""_blank"">EcoBoost</A>,” Ford’s <A href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgilKUwMl2A"" target=""_blank"">new fuel-efficiency package</A>, will be available on more than 80 percent of all vehicles by 2012. Will the company stand by its latest promise regardless of marketplace fluctuations? Viera says yes, but he admits that “we are not all there yet” on making sustainability a core part of the business model. Perhaps most telling, though, is that EcoBoost is being introduced as a nonstandard option that costs extra. When I asked Mulally about this at a crowded luncheon in September, the <FONT class=""acronym_smallcaps"">ceo</FONT> seemed surprised, and had to turn to his PR staff for confirmation.</P><P style=""background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"">Given Ford’s painful lessons, it’s worrisome that the company is now depending on optional technologies to reduce fuel consumption. Analysts like David Cole point out that as gas prices rise and fall within their new, higher range, consumers are already becoming more comfortable with them—and that comfort could push some of them back toward trucks and <FONT class=""acronym_smallcaps"">suv</FONT>s. If consumers, politicians, and business leaders can’t plan for a more efficient future regardless of the price of oil, steep declines in shareholder value will be the least of our worries.</P></ARTICLE><FOOTER class=""entry-footer""><SECTION id=""mj-article-bottom-membership-widget-3"" class=""widget mj-article-bottom-membership-widget""><H3>FIGHT DISINFORMATION:</H3><P><STRONG>Disinformation is one of the biggest threats our democracy faces.</STRONG> Like our reporting on dark money, it is one of those stories behind all the other stories.</P><P><STRONG>So we want to build a team dedicated to tracking and exposing the forces behind disinformation as a new reporting priority before this fall's midterms.</STRONG> But to do it, we need to raise $100,000 that we didn't plan on before June 30.
