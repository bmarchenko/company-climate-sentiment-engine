The city also notes that each defendant knew of the harms and risks associating with the production of fossil fuels such as GHG's remaining in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, which allegedly lead to <mark>climate change</mark> or global warning. </P><P>The city alleges they have suffered damages from these productions through inundation, erosion, and regular tidal flooding.

(Craig Ruttle/AP)</DIV></DIV><P data-elm-loc=""1"">The New York City government is suing the world’s five largest publicly traded oil companies, seeking to hold them responsible for present and future damage to the city from <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P data-elm-loc=""2"">The suit, filed Tuesday against BP, Chevron, Conoco-Phillips, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, claims the companies together produced 11 percent of all of global-warming gases through the oil and gas products they have sold over the years. It also charges that the companies and the industry they are part of have known for some time about the consequences but sought to obscure them.</P><P data-elm-loc=""3"">“In this litigation, the City seeks to shift the costs of protecting the City from <mark>climate change</mark> impacts back onto the companies that have done nearly all they could to create this existential threat,” reads the lawsuit, brought by New York corporation counsel Zachary Carter and filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.</P><P data-elm-loc=""4"">The legal strategy has already been embraced by several California cities and counties, but prior lawsuits seeking to blame companies for their role in causing <mark>climate change</mark> have foundered.</P><P data-elm-loc=""5"">It remains unclear whether a new wave of litigation — propelled by stronger <mark>climate</mark> science, reports about how much some companies knew about <mark>climate change</mark> decades ago, and somewhat divergent legal strategies — will succeed where those efforts failed.</P><P data-elm-loc=""6"">In California last year, Marin County, San Mateo County and the city of Imperial Beach similarly <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/07/20/this-could-be-the-next-big-strategy-for-suing-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">sued</A> a group of fossil fuel companies over damage related to <mark>climate change</mark> — citing a theory called “public nuisance,” which basically argues that companies are causing an injury to the localities under common law. The cities of San Francisco and Oakland and the city and county of Santa Cruz have also filed suit.</P><P data-elm-loc=""7"">“I think the significant development here is that this is the first of these cases in this last year that’s filed outside of California,” said Michael Burger, who directs the Sabin Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Law at Columbia University. If more and more localities sue, “we might be able to see adequate pressure applied to these companies to inspire action on <mark>climate change</mark>,” he said.</P><P data-elm-loc=""8"">So far, that has not been the response. ExxonMobil has instead <A href=""http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/09/investing/exxon-<mark>climate</mark>-change-california-san-francisco-oakland/index.html"" target=""_blank"">reacted strongly</A> to the claims, <A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4345487-Exxon-Texas-Petition-Jan-2018.html"" target=""_blank"">seeking in Texas court</A> to depose California state officials and others involved in bringing the cases for “potential claims of abuse of process, civil conspiracy, and violation of ExxonMobil’s civil rights.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""9""><mark>Climate change</mark> “is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-<mark>carbon</mark> choices for businesses and consumers,” Curtis Smith, head of U.S. media relations for Shell, wrote by email, “not by the courts.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""10"">BP and ConocoPhillips, two other defendants named in the lawsuit, declined to comment.</P><P data-elm-loc=""11"">Exxon <A href=""https://energyfactor.exxonmobil.com/perspectives/better-approach-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" target=""_blank"">responded</A> to New York’s lawsuit on its blog, where the firm has also challenged investigative reports from Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News and the Los Angeles Times that showed the company was an early pioneer in <mark>climate</mark>-change science in the 1980s, reports that were cited in the suit.</P><P data-elm-loc=""12"">“ExxonMobil welcomes any well-meaning and good faith attempt to address the risks of <mark>climate change</mark>,” wrote Suzanne McCarron, Exxon’s vice president of public and government affairs. “Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions. Lawsuits of this kind — filed by trial attorneys against an industry that provides products we all rely upon to power the economy and enable our domestic life — simply do not do that.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""13"">Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall said in an email: “This lawsuit is factually and legally meritless, and will do nothing to address the serious issue of <mark>climate change</mark>. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue that requires global engagement. Should this litigation proceed, it will only serve special interests at the expense of broader policy, regulatory and economic priorities.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""14"" class=""interstitial-link ""><I>[<A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/01/10/beaches-line-the-coast-like-pearls-other-states-ask-why-floridas-are-more-special"">Beaches line the coast like pearls.

And what a horrible, disgusting way to profit — the way it puts so many people’s lives in danger.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""23"">“It’s time that they are held accountable,” de Blasio said. “It’s time that things change in the way we do business.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""24"" class=""interstitial-link ""><I>[<A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/01/08/hurricanes-wildfires-made-2017-the-most-costly-u-s-disaster-year-on-record"">Extreme hurricanes and wildfires made 2017 the most costly U.S. disaster year on record</A>]</I></P><P data-elm-loc=""25"">In addition to the litigation, officials said they expect to divest up to $5 billion in investments from as many as 190 companies with fossil fuel ties, even as they promised to maintain their fiduciary duty to New York’s pensioners.</P><P data-elm-loc=""26"">“We’re using this moment to send a message to the world,” said New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer. “We believe a green economy is a thriving economy.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""27"">Bill McKibben, an author and co-founder of the <mark>climate</mark> advocacy group 350.org, praised the city’s actions Wednesday.</P><P data-elm-loc=""28"">“I’ve been watching the <mark>climate</mark> fight for the last 30 years,” McKibben told reporters. “This is one of the handful of most important moments in that 30-year fight.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""29"">But the oil and gas lobby said that by not investing in their industry, New York was doing city workers a disservice.</P><P data-elm-loc=""30"">“Today Mayor de Blasio turned his back on millions of first responders, police officers and public employees who depend on their pensions to provide for themselves and their families in retirement,” said Karen Moreau, New York executive director for the American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. oil and gas lobbying group. “Government pension managers have a responsibility by law to seek the greatest return for their investors and pensions that invest in oil and natural gas companies have historically delivered a stronger return than other investments.”</P><P data-elm-loc=""31""><EM>Brady Dennis contributed to this report.</EM></P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""moat-trackable pb-f-theme-normal pb-f-dehydrate-false pb-f-async-false full pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-article-article-author-bio"" moat-id=""article/article-author-bio"" data-chain-name=""no-name"" data-feature-name=""no-name"" data-feature-id=""article/article-author-bio"" data-pb-fingerprint=""0f7Y1cjOKqD"" id=""fUpLQ61uzH1kSq""><DIV class=""pb-bottom-author-wrapper border-bottom-hairline border-bottom-100-pct""><DIV class=""pb-bottom-author ""><DIV class=""pb-author-info ""><DIV class=""pb-author-bio"">Chris Mooney covers <mark>climate change</mark>, energy, and the environment.

In December, Rep. Jerry McNerney, a California Democrat, introduced an unprecedented <A href=""https://mcnerney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-mcnerney-introduces-groundbreaking-geoengineering-bill"" target=""_blank"">bill</A> seeking funds for geoengineering research and development. In February, Trump signed a budget that includes <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2018/02/09/the-energy-202-budget-deal-picks-winners-and-losers-in-energy-industry/5a7c914b30fb041c3c7d76f7/?utm_term=.f099a77d7ba1"" target=""_blank"">first-ever tax breaks</A>, with bipartisan support, for using new technologies to <A href=""http://www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk/what-is-geoengineering/what-is-geoengineering/"" target=""_blank"">capture <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide</A> from the atmosphere, a strategy many experts consider to be a kind of geoengineering.</P><P>“The future is bright for geoengineering,” Republican Rep. Randy Weber of Texas, chairman of the Energy Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, said at a <A href=""https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-environment-and-subcommittee-energy-hearing-geoengineering"" target=""_blank"">hearing</A> in November.</P><P>In the past, Weber has <A href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/26/house-science-committee-c_n_5533992.html"" target=""_blank"">grilled scientists</A> on “global cooling” and rejected a <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> tax as “<A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/apr/04/inconceivable-the-latest-theatrical-house-science-committee-hearing"" target=""_blank"">blasphemy</A>.” Yet at the hearing, he claimed that specific, yet-untested proposals such as “placement of mirrors in space” and “brightening the clouds overhead … could have a cooling effect on our lower atmosphere.”</P><H3>‘Hacking the planet’</H3><P>Trump himself has not publicly addressed geoengineering, his budget proposals make no mention of it, and none of his cabinet members has publicly endorsed it. Neither Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt nor Paul Dabbar, the Energy Department’s undersecretary for science, responded to requests for comment.</P><P>Nevertheless, said Harvard University physics professor David Keith, “there’s much more broad support for this than there was just two years ago.”</P><P>Keith, who wrote a 2013 book, “A Case for <mark>Climate</mark> Engineering,” leads one of the world’s most advanced and closely watched geoengineering research projects. Later this year, his <A href=""https://keith.seas.harvard.edu/david-keith-and-solar-geoengineering"" target=""_blank"">team</A> plans to conduct its first outdoor trial, launching a slow-moving balloon over Tucson, Arizona, to disperse substances such as calcium <mark>carbon</mark>ate dust or sulfur dioxide to reflect the sun’s rays back into space. The scientists believe this approach, known as solar radiation management, could mimic the <mark>climate</mark>-cooling effect of a volcano such as the Philippines’ Mount Pinatubo, whose eruption in 1991 caused a temporary global drop in temperatures of about 1 degree Fahrenheit. Keith <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/magazine/is-it-ok-to-engineer-the-environment-to-fight-<mark>climate</mark>-change.html"" target=""_blank"">estimates</A> full-scale deployment would cost about $1 billion a year.</P><P>The increasing interest in geoengineering, including from <mark>climate change</mark> skeptics, owes partly to growing <A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/<mark>climate</mark>-may-be-15-warmer-than-previously-thought-by-2100-2017-12"" target=""_blank"">pessimism</A> about humanity’s capacity—and political will—to ward off the worst effects of <mark>climate change</mark> without some major technological breakthrough. Microsoft Corp. founder <A href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2010/01/bill-gates-funding-geoengineering-research"" target=""_blank"">Bill Gates</A> has invested both in Keith’s research and in a for-profit <A href=""http://<mark>carbon</mark>engineering.com/"" target=""_blank"">company</A> Keith founded to try to capture <mark>carbon</mark> from the atmosphere. In 2015, two major US environmental groups, the <A href=""https://www.edf.org/<mark>climate</mark>/our-position-geoengineering"" target=""_blank"">Environmental Defense Fund</A> and the <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/media/2015/150210"" target=""_blank"">Natural Resources Defense Council</A>, supported small-scale research into projects that one writer has dubbed “<A href=""https://www.npr.org/books/titles/138090460/hack-the-planet-sciences-best-hope-or-worst-nightmare-for-averting-<mark>climate</mark>-catas"" target=""_blank"">hacking the planet</A>.”</P><P>Several Trump allies are considerably more gung-ho, with some explicitly portraying geoengineering as a cheap alternative to radically transforming a US economy that is still about <A href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=21912"" target=""_blank"">80 percent dependent</A> on fossil fuels.</P><P>“Instead of forcing unworkable and costly government mandates on the American people, we should look to technology and <mark>innovation</mark> to lead the way to address <mark>climate change</mark>,” Rep. Lamar Smith chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, said at last fall’s hearing.</P><P>Smith, a Texas Republican and Trump stalwart heavily <A href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/industries?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00001811&amp;type=I"" target=""_blank"">backed</A> by the fossil fuel industry, has been one of the most aggressive <mark>climate</mark> science skeptics in Congress. Yet at the hearing, he called for more research into geoengineering, saying, “Some scientists believe it could achieve substantial environmental benefits at a cheaper cost than regulations.”</P><P>Likewise, former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a devoted ally of Trump’s who has portrayed <mark>climate change</mark> as the left wing’s “<A href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2011/05/gingrich-recalls-global-cooling-055848"" target=""_blank"">newest excuse to take control of lives</A>,” has also praised <A href=""http://humanevents.com/2008/06/03/stop-the-green-pig-defeat-the-boxerwarnerlieberman-green-pork-bill-capping-american-jobs-and-trading-americas-future/"" target=""_blank"">geoengineering</A> for its “promise of addressing global warming concerns for just a few billion dollars a year.”</P><P>Attorney David Schnare, a Trump transition appointee at the EPA who has since left the administration, has challenged mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science and <A href=""https://www.buzzfeed.com/danvergano/trump-transition-lawyer-has-spent-years-suing-for-<mark>climate</mark>-em?utm_term=.gwZV3mj5L#.vwM6v5YRA"" target=""_blank"">filed lawsuits</A> seeking access to <mark>climate</mark> scientists’ emails, while championing <A href=""http://www.academia.edu/9864788/<mark>Climate</mark>_Change_and_the_Uncomfortable_Middle_Ground_The_Geoengineering_and_No_Regrets_Policy_Alternative"" target=""_blank"">geoengineering</A> as “a means to put off the most catastrophic potential effects” of global warming.</P><P>For several years, conservative think tanks, including the American Enterprise Institute, the Hoover Institution and The Heartland Institute, have taken a similarly paradoxical position, challenging established <mark>climate</mark> science while promoting geoengineering. Scholars working for the American Enterprise Institute’s Geoengineering Project have <A href=""http://www.aei.org/events/geoengineering-a-revolutionary-approach-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" target=""_blank"">touted the strategy</A> as “a revolutionary approach to <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><H3>‘Howlingly barking mad’</H3><P>Over the past several years, scientists and entrepreneurs throughout the world have proposed more than a dozen different kinds of geoengineering projects. One would send 16 trillion <A href=""http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160425-how-a-giant-space-umbrella-could-stop-global-warming"" target=""_blank"">tiny robots into space</A> to deflect the sun’s rays from the Earth. Another would build <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/12/plan-to-refreeze-arctic-before-ice-goes-for-good-<mark>climate</mark>-change"" target=""_blank"">millions of wind-powered pumps</A> in Arctic waters to push freezing water over the ice to thicken it. The “<A href=""http://www.mcbproject.org/"" target=""_blank"">cloud-brightening</A>” scheme praised by Weber last fall envisions shooting salt water into marine clouds to improve their reflective power.</P><P>These aren’t even the most radical ideas. Back in 1993, an Indian physicist considered whether the Earth could be cooled by somehow increasing the <A href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=6RoK8Xh_mHAC&amp;pg=PA1994&amp;lpg=PA1994&amp;dq=indian%20physicist%20<mark>climate</mark>%20change%20change%20earth%27s%20orbit%20jain&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CzWd9S-vbp&amp;sig=qW9-xkqthdVVjTzrL-n2t85AEZU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji57WPtbrZAhVF9WMKHexbD8gQ6AEIWzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=indian%20physicist%20<mark>climate</mark>%20change%20change%20earth%27s%20orbit%20jain&amp;f=false"" target=""_blank"">radius of the planet’s orbit</A> around the sun. And in a widely condemned operation in 2012, a rogue California businessman conducted the world’s <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/15/pacific-iron-fertilisation-geoengineering"" target=""_blank"">largest geoengineering project</A> to date by dumping 100 tons of iron dust into the Pacific Ocean. His goal was to fertilize plankton to absorb <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and then sell “credits” to fossil fuel firms.</P><P>Solar radiation management proposals, such as the cloud-brightening strategy and the Harvard aerosol-spraying plan, have attracted the most interest from US politicians, even as they’ve caused alarm among leading <mark>climate</mark> scientists.</P><P>“The idea of ‘fixing’ the <mark>climate</mark> by hacking the Earth’s reflection of sunlight is wildly, utterly, howlingly barking mad,” Oxford University physics professor Raymond Pierrehumbert <A href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/02/nrc_geoengineering_report_<mark>climate</mark>_hacking_is_dangerous_and_barking_mad.html"" target=""_blank"">wrote</A> in a 2015 Slate article. He was a lead author of the Nobel Prize-winning Third Assessment Report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>.</P><P>In an interview, Pierrehumbert compared such strategies with “jumping off the Washington Monument and hoping somebody invents anti-gravity before you hit the ground.”</P><P>He and other scientists say large-scale spraying of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, as envisioned by Harvard’s Keith, could deplete the ozone layer, harm some plants and animals, and benefit some countries while causing droughts in others, stirring <A href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/522676/the-geopolitics-of-geoengineering/"" target=""_blank"">global conflict</A> akin to nuclear rivalries. Furthermore, barring radical cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, such projects, once begun, might have to be continued indefinitely to prevent worse warming than before, a phenomenon known as the termination effect.</P><P>An additional danger, which Keith himself has <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/10/30/david-keith-explains-why-geoengineering-isnt-as-crazy-as-it-sounds/?utm_term=.65c487c547fd"" target=""_blank"">cited</A>, stems from geoengineering’s potential “moral hazard,” an insurance industry term that refers to how people behave more recklessly when they know they have a fallback. In other words, the promise of geoengineering might convince politicians that they need not worry about reforming our energy economy.</P><P>“If we don’t cut emissions, we’re sunk, and it would be criminal if people use this as an excuse to avoid that,” Keith said in an interview with Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting.</P><P>This is precisely what worries Janos Pasztor, former UN assistant secretary-general for <mark>climate change</mark>, who has been leading a <A href=""https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/programs/ccgg"" target=""_blank"">new global effort</A> to improve public discussion and governance of geoengineering proposals. He said the House hearing last fall “sent the wrong signal to the world,” noting that it took place just as world leaders were meeting at the UN’s annual <mark>climate change</mark> conference to discuss ways to lower greenhouse gases.</P><P>“At the very same time, US politicians were talking about stopping all these activities that could make a difference and talking about geoengineering, as if it’s some sort of a plan B,” Pasztor said. “It’s not a plan B. Maybe it could give us some time, but it’s not a solution.”</P><H3>Boots on the ice</H3><P>Field, the Ice911 founder, says she’s also concerned that the promise of a geoengineering fix might sap political will to cut emissions. Yet that hasn’t deterred her from joining other scientists and entrepreneurs rushing into the leadership vacuum.</P><P>“I don’t want Ice911 to be an excuse for building another coal mine,” she said. “But we have to do something. Our backs are up against the wall.”</P><P>Field, an inventor with 53 patents, began her research with buckets of cold water on the front deck of her home in Portola Valley, California, where she tested a variety of materials, including hay and daisies, to see how well they could prevent the sun’s rays from raising water temperatures. After settling on silica, she scaled up her experiments with trials on ice in California’s Sierra Nevada and on Canada’s Miquelon Lake.</P><P>Along the way, she raised funds from private donors, the largest contribution being a three-year, $1.3 million grant from a family foundation she heard about from a wealthy friend with whom she volunteered at her sons’ school. The money has helped pay for land-use permits and logistical support from <A href=""http://uicalaska.com/our-lands/science-support/"" target=""_blank"">Ukpeaġvik Iñupiat Corp.</A>, an indigenous-run organization in Barrow, Alaska. In May, Field and a small group of volunteers used an agricultural spreader, dragged by a snowmobile, to cover an area of ice the size of three football fields on an inland lake in Alaska.</P><P>Next week, Field plans to dispatch a buoy into the Arctic Ocean to monitor sea ice, and then return next month to try dispersing more sand on lake ice. She has not yet secured permits to perform tests on sea ice.</P><P>“Ice911 is the boots on the ground solution acting now to ease <mark>climate change</mark> by restoring Arctic ice,” reads Field’s fundraising pamphlet, what she conceded in an interview was an overstatement. Ice911 has yet to have any impact on <mark>climate change</mark>. Before that can happen, she said, she needs to build credibility for her approach, which has yet to win respect from the so-called <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/05/clique-geoengineering-debate"" target=""_blank"">geo-clique</A>—a small group of North American scientists who advise politicians and large funders.</P><P>Among Field’s harshest critics is Ken Caldeira, an atmospheric scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science’s Department of Global Ecology at Stanford University, who has collaborated with Keith and <A href=""https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Year-in-Review-2016"" target=""_blank"">worked with Bill Gates</A>. Caldeira dismissed Ice911 as unrealistic.</P><P>“This isn’t anything anyone is going to do,” Caldeira said. “It’s hard to do, not that effective, and you’d have to do it over millions of acres.”</P><P>Field disputes this. She said she recently hired <mark>climate</mark> modelers who she said assured her that Ice911 could lower Arctic temperatures by placing her sand in limited, strategic locations, such as the Fram Strait between Greenland and Svalbard.</P><P>“We’re working to simply restore an ecosystem that has a profound effect on the planet’s weather patterns,” she said. “That’s a lot better than putting a known pollutant into our one and only atmosphere.”</P><P>Harvard’s Keith, whom Time magazine honored in 2009 as a “<A href=""http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1924149_1924154_1924428,00.html"" target=""_blank"">hero of the environment</A>,” gives voice, often simultaneously, to the world’s fears and hopes for geoengineering. In the span of a single conversation with comedian and TV host <A href=""https://www.metabunk.org/david-keith-on-colbert-discussing-geoengineering.t2798/"" target=""_blank"">Stephen Colbert</A> in 2013, he called geoengineering “ugly” and “horrifying” but also said, “It might actually save people and be useful.”</P><P>Many scientists warn that the longer politicians ignore other strategies, the more likely society eventually will need to make the hard choice to try geoengineering. Still, Keith said he is unnerved by <mark>climate change</mark> skeptics’ recent embrace of geoengineering.</P><P>“In some ways,” Keith said <A href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609379/why-this-geoengineering-pioneers-worst-nightmare-is-a-trump-tweet/"" target=""_blank"">at a conference last fall</A>, “the thing we fear the most is a tweet from Trump, saying, ‘Solar geoengineering solves everything! It’s great! We don’t need to bother to cut emissions.’”</P></DIV><DIV class=""related-cne-video-component""><H4 class=""related-cne-video-component__brow""> Related Video</H4><DIV class=""related-cne-video-component__info""><SPAN class=""related-cne-video-component__cat"">Science</SPAN><H5 class=""related-cne-video-component__hed"">How <mark>Climate Change</mark> Is Already Affecting Earth</H5><P class=""related-cne-video-component__dek"">Though the planet has only warmed by one-degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution, <mark>climate change</mark>'s effect on earth has been anything but subtle.

Attorneys seek an order requiring defendants to abate the global warming-induced sea level rise by funding an abatement program to build sea walls and other infrastructure. Attorneys for the cities say this abatement fund will be in the billions.
The two complaints, filed Sept. 19, 2017, in California Superior Court in San Francisco and Alameda counties name as defendant five fossil fuel corporations that have produced more fossil fuels than any other investor-owned companies in the world and seeks to hold them accountable for past, ongoing and future-planned development of fossil fuels, which is directly impacting the cities’ risk of rising sea levels, the suit says. “This case is, fundamentally, about shifting the costs of abating sea level rise harm – one of global warming’s gravest harms – back onto the companies,” the suit reads.
The suits state that the defendants knowingly continue their environmentally destructive behavior, seeking to shroud it with a sophisticated campaign to sway public opinion on fossil fuel use and that defendants have misleadingly downplayed the risks of global warming with a campaign of denial that was intended to promote their fossil fuels products. &quot;This egregious state of affairs is no accident. Rather, it is an unlawful public nuisance of the first order.”
The suits detail a history of flagrant disregard from Big Oil as the impacts of fossil fuel usage on the environment became more and more clear and that the management of these corporations were warned by their own scientists and trade association scientists in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The suits state that the defendants knew that “massive fossil fuel usage would cause dangerous global warming.”
These actions carry on into the present, as the risk of rising sea levels intensifies, especially for coastal cities. “Defendants took these stark warnings and proceeded to double-down on fossil fuels,” the complaint states. “Even at this time, with the global warming danger level at a critical phase, defendants continue to engage in massive fossil fuel production and execute long-term business plans to continue and even expand their fossil fuel production for decades into the future.”</P></SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

But in a broken political system dominated by tit for tat Twitter attacks, it might be the only place left in America where actual adults can address these issues calmly and maturely. The cities of San Francisco and Oakland have sued 5 major oil companies — Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Shell, and BP — claiming they knew decades ago that their operations were causing average global temperatures to increase, and that they kept their knowledge private, putting millions of people at risk. In particular, those who live in the San Francisco Bay Area are likely to suffer damages as a result of rising ocean levels that threaten to put large swaths of land adjacent to the Bay underwater.</P><H3 style=""text-align: center;"">8 Questions</H3><DIV id=""attachment_142874"" style=""width: 580px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Judge William Alsup Credit: Sacramento Bee</P></DIV><P>One of the adults in the room is judge William Alsup.

He applauded Judge Alsup for his unique approach to the proceedings in his courtroom. “Obviously, I wish these issues were not still being debated in court, since they’re not being debated in the scientific community, but I also appreciate the deliberate approach the judge seems to be taking,” he said in a written comment to <EM><A href=""https://grist.org/article/a-federal-judge-has-<mark>climate</mark>-science-questions-here-are-the-answers/"">Grist</A>.</EM></P><H3 style=""text-align: center;"">Chevron Will Not Contest That <mark>Climate Change</mark> Is Real</H3><P>Lawyers for Chevron say they will not contest that <mark>climate change</mark> is real. Instead, they say they will accept the findings set forth in the <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/"">Fifth Assessment report</A> of the <A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/"">Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark></A>. “Chevron’s neither going to overstate nor understate degrees of confidence. Chevron’s simply going to present the conclusions of the IPCC because Chevron thinks that’s the best and the most accurate way of responding to the court’s tutorial request,” Avi Garbow, co-chair of the environmental litigation group at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, the law firm representing Chevron. Garbow once worked in the Obama administration and defended the Clean Power Plan in court when he was general counsel to Gina McCarthy, who headed the EPA at the time, according to <EM><A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chevron-will-stick-to-ipcc-findings-in-landmark-<mark>climate</mark>-change-trial/"">Scientific American</A>.</EM></P><P>Even though the defendants have not sought to make the reality of <mark>climate change</mark> an issue in the case, they are still seeking to dismiss the case on the grounds that only the EPA has the legal authority to regulate <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions under current US law. That’s an interesting strategy, since the fossil fuel companies, via their highly paid shills at the American Petroleum Institute and other industry trade groups, screamed bloody murder when the EPA first proposed to regulate <mark>carbon</mark> emissions as a pollutant. Which only proves once again that hypocrisy is the best friend of those looking to make a buck while jeopardizing the health of the planet and all the species who live on it.</P><P>“This is not the first (or even the second or third) time a plaintiff has tried to plead global warming-related tort claims,” Chevron said in its motion to dismiss. “Similar claims have been considered, and dismissed, by the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit, and district courts around the country.”</P><P><mark>Climate</mark> scientists are distressed that the Fifth Assessment report will become the measuring stick for this litigation.  The <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2018/02/26/keeping-global-temperature-increase-1-5-degrees-celsius-unlikely-says-ipcc-draft-report/"">Sixth Assessment</A> report is now being prepared and will be issued in 2019. Early drafts paint a much darker picture than the current report. Because of the rigorous process that goes into preparing each report (a process that is waved away by <mark>climate</mark> deniers as mere “junk science”), each report is necessarily several years behind the most up-to-date <mark>climate</mark> science.</P><P>Will this lawsuit be the final nail in the coffin of the oil companies? Probably not. Even if Judge Alsup finds in favor of the plaintiffs, his decision will have to withstand scrutiny from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and a hostile majority of committed <mark>climate</mark> deniers on the US Supreme Court. But the suit could have important implications nonetheless.</P><P>Daniel Farber, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, says “Most or all of the major oil corporations have now acknowledged the reality of <mark>climate change</mark> and the need for government action (though who knows how serious they are about that). So it would be hard for them to take a contrary view in this litigation. Getting them to say the same thing in court will be kind of a victory for the plaintiffs even if nothing else goes their way,” according to the <EM>Scientific American</EM> story. Maybe baby steps are the best we can hope for at this juncture.</P><P><CENTER><EM><STRONG><SPAN style=""font-size: large;"">Support CleanTechnica’s work via donations on <A href=""https://www.patreon.com/CleanTechnica/overview"" rel=""nofollow""><STRONG><SPAN style=""color: #339966;"">Patreon</SPAN></STRONG></A> or <A href=""https://www.paypal.me/ImportantMedia"" rel=""nofollow""><STRONG><SPAN style=""color: #339966;"">PayPal</SPAN></STRONG></A>!</SPAN></STRONG></EM></CENTER></P></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Circuit Said FERC Needed to Provide More Information on Pipelines’ Downstream Greenhouse Gas Emissions—Or Explain Why It Couldn’t</STRONG></P><P>In a split opinion, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the environmental impact statement (EIS) prepared by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for the Southeast Market Pipelines Project did not contain enough information on the greenhouse gas emissions that would result from combustion of the gas that the project would carry. When completed, the project—which comprises three interstate natural-gas pipelines in the southeastern United States—would be able to carry one billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. The D.C. Circuit concluded that “at a minimum, FERC should have estimated the amount of power-plant <mark>carbon</mark> emissions that the pipelines will make possible” because it was reasonably foreseeable that the transported gas would be burned in Florida power plants. The court distinguished its conclusion in earlier cases that FERC had no legal authority to consider the environmental effects of natural gas that would be exported from the liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities it authorized. The D.C. Circuit said that while FERC was forbidden from relying on the environmental effects of gas exports as a justification for denying an upgrade license for an LNG facility, FERC’s authority over pipelines permitted FERC to deny a pipeline certificate on the ground that it would be too harmful to the environment. The D.C. Circuit also was not persuaded by FERC’s “practical objection” regarding the impossibility of knowing “exactly what quantity of greenhouse gases will be emitted as a result of this project being approved.” The court said FERC should have either made a quantitative estimate of downstream greenhouse gas emissions or “explained more specifically” why it could not do so. The court also indicated that the fact that downstream emissions might be offset by reductions elsewhere (from the retirement of coal-fired plants, for example) did not excuse FERC from making emissions estimates. In response to petitioner Sierra Club’s argument that FERC should use the Social Cost of <mark>Carbon</mark> to convert emissions estimates to concrete harms, the D.C. Circuit directed FERC to explain in the EIS whether it would adopt the position it took in the EIS for an LNG terminal that the Social Cost of <mark>Carbon</mark> was not useful for purposes of environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act. In addition to its holdings regarding FERC’s greenhouse gas emissions analysis, the D.C. Circuit also determined as a threshold matter that the petitioners had standing to challenge all three segments of the pipeline project, not just the segment alleged to have caused an injury-in-fact and upheld other aspects of FERC’s environmental review. Judge Janice Rogers Brown dissented on the issue of downstream emissions, writing that in her view such emissions did not need to be considered because FERC did not control whether the greenhouse gas emissions would occur. <EM><A href=""http://columbia.us13.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=9906c7202590aac6a8bdbb7b9&amp;id=374d89de0f&amp;e=c70ad85e80"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Sierra Club v.

The court found that OSM failed to take a hard look at indirect and cumulative effects of coal transportation and combustion and at foreseeable greenhouse gas emissions. Although OSM calculated the greenhouse gas emissions associated with coal transportation, the court found that it had not considered other reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts for which analysis would be “possible and not merely speculative.” With respect to greenhouse gas emissions from coal combustion, the court found that OSM’s quantification of such emissions was not sufficient, and that OSM should also have quantified the economic costs associated with emissions since it had quantified the modification’s economic benefits. The Court also found that OSM should have considered non-greenhouse gas <mark>pollution</mark> associated with combustion. In addition, the court said OSM had improperly decided not to prepare an EIS despite “significant uncertainty about the critical issues,” citing OSM’s failure to adequately evaluate the plan modification’s “context” beyond the local and regional levels and its failure to consider the plan modification’s coal transportation and air <mark>pollution</mark> effects in its “intensity” analysis. <EM><A href=""http://columbia.us13.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=9906c7202590aac6a8bdbb7b9&amp;id=347eca3c5e&amp;e=c70ad85e80"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Montana Environmental Information Center v.

Circuit Upheld Department of Energy’s Environmental Review for Authorization of LNG Exports from Texas Terminal</STRONG></P><P>The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) authorization of the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Freeport Terminal on Quintana Island in Texas, rejecting claims that DOE had not sufficiently examined environmental impacts under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) or fulfilled its obligations under the Natural Gas Act. The court ruled that DOE had provided a “reasoned explanation as to why it believed the indirect effects pertaining to increased gas production were not reasonably foreseeable” and had not failed to comply with NEPA “by declining to make specific projections about environmental impacts stemming from specific levels” of increased production. Similarly, the court found that DOE was not required to make specific projections about the indirect effects of a potential switch in the U.S. power sector from gas to coal in response to higher gas prices due to increased exports. The court also found that DOE had adequately considered the potential greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the indirect effects of exports, noting that DOE had evaluated the upstream and downstream emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and methane from producing, transporting, and exporting LNG in a “Life Cycle Report” commissioned by DOE to supplement the EIS prepared by FERC. (The D.C. Circuit said DOE “plainly relie[d]” on the Life Cycle Report and another supplemental report to justify its hard look. The D.C. Circuit therefore considered both supplemental reports to be part of DOE’s environmental review even though DOE argued that it complied with NEPA by adopting FERC’s EIS.) The court was not persuaded that DOE was required to consider the cumulative impacts of other pending and anticipated LNG export approvals. The court also upheld DOE’s “public interest,” finding under the Natural Gas Act, rejecting contentions that DOE had failed to thoroughly consider environmental concerns. <EM><A href=""http://columbia.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9906c7202590aac6a8bdbb7b9&amp;id=d263015976&amp;e=c70ad85e80"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Sierra Club v.

The Ninth Circuit held that the FWS had reasonably concluded that though the unusual characteristics of the desert eagle population segment satisfied the “persistence” factor for significance, those characteristics did not necessarily require a conclusion that the population segment was ecologically or biologically significant for the bald eagle taxon as a whole. The Ninth Circuit also held that the FWS had reasonably found that extirpation of the desert eagle population segment would not create a significant gap in the range of the taxon. The Ninth Circuit also rejected the argument that the FWS had ignored <mark>climate change</mark> as a factor for determining the desert eagles’ significance to the taxon, finding that the FWS “directly addressed <mark>climate change</mark>” and concluded that the best information available indicated that <mark>climate change</mark> was not a significant threat to the bald eagle.  <EM><A href=""http://columbia.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9906c7202590aac6a8bdbb7b9&amp;id=c28625ae7e&amp;e=c70ad85e80"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Center for Biological Diversity v.

Pruitt</A></EM>, No. 17-1145 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 10, 2017).</P><P><STRONG>D.C. Circuit Vacated EPA Requirement to Replace HFCs</STRONG></P><P>In a split opinion, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that EPA lacked authority to issue a 2015 rule restricting manufacturers from making certain products containing hydrofluoro<mark>carbon</mark>s (HFCs). Because HFCs were greenhouse gases that contribute to <mark>climate change</mark>, EPA removed certain HFCs from a list of safe substitutes created pursuant to Section 612 of the Clean Air Act, which requires manufacturers to replace ozone-depleting substances with safe substitutes. EPA added the HFCs, which are not ozone-depleting substances, to a list of prohibited substitutes. EPA said Section 612 gave EPA authority to prohibit manufacturers that had replaced ozone-depleting substances with HFCs previously on the safe substitutes list from making products containing the now-prohibited HFCs. The D.C. Circuit found that EPA’s “novel reading” of Section 612 was “inconsistent with the statute as written” because it stretched the meaning of “replace” beyond its ordinary meaning. The D.C. Circuit said manufacturers “replace” an ozone-depleting substance only once—when they transition to making the same product with a substitute substance. The court said EPA’s reading of “replace,” in which manufacturers continue to “replace” the ozone-depleting substance every time the substitute is used, would render EPA’s authority “boundless” and that such an interpretation “borders on the absurd.”  The D.C. Circuit did, however, uphold EPA’s decision to remove the HFCs from the list of safe substitutes. The court also said EPA did not “squarely articulate” an alternative “retroactive disapproval” rationale for requiring manufacturers to replace HFCs, and said that EPA would have to justify such an approach on remand if it chose to rely on it. Judge Robert L. Wilkins dissented from the conclusion that Section 612 unambiguously prohibited EPA from requiring replacement of the HFCs. In his view, the statutory provision was ambiguous and EPA’s interpretation of the statutory scheme was reasonable. <EM><A href=""http://columbia.us13.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=9906c7202590aac6a8bdbb7b9&amp;id=938cadca02&amp;e=c70ad85e80"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Mexichem Fluor, Inc. v.

Circuit ordered—on its own motion—that challenges to the Clean Power Plan continue to be held in abeyance for 60 more days and that EPA continue filing status reports at 30-day intervals. Five days earlier, public health and environmental organizations that had intervened as respondents asked the court to decide the case on the merits or terminate it by remanding the case to EPA. They said EPA’s classification of its Clean Power Plan review as a “Long Term Action” in the Trump administration’s Current Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions indicated a proposed rule might be delayed for at least another year. On August 10, the D.C. Circuit ordered—again on its own motion—that the cases challenging the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide standards for new, modified, and reconstructed power plants (NSPS) remain held in abeyance pending further order of the court, with status reports to be filed at 90-day intervals. <EM><A href=""http://columbia.us13.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=9906c7202590aac6a8bdbb7b9&amp;id=c82402a8f3&amp;e=c70ad85e80"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">West Virginia v.

The court’s decision addressed one plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment challenging redactions in 10 documents produced by the State Department and the State Department’s cross-motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff contended that the 10 documents were a small sample of unjustified redactions and partial withholdings representing improper application of FOIA Exemptions 1 (for classified material), 5 (for predecisional intra- or inter-agency documents), and 6 (for personnel and medical files that would constitute an invasion of privacy). The court found that the State Department had provided sufficient information about documents withheld pursuant to Exemption 1 to demonstrate that they were properly encompassed by the exemption and that the timing of the State Department’s classification of the information as confidential was not automatically invalid based on its timing. The court also rejected challenges to redactions based on Exemption 5. The redacted information in one document related to formulating a response to a foreign official and to internal discussions about possible topics for a future meeting; redacted information in a second document was a draft list of names of “possible validators of … <mark>climate change</mark> work.” A third document redacted discussions of potential State Department engagement with congressional staff. The court also concluded that documents were properly redacted based on Exemption 6 to exclude private and personal conversation between two individuals concerning career matters, the draft <mark>climate change</mark> “validators” list, and a summary of  conversations between a private individual and Indian officials. The court also ruled that the second plaintiff could not file an additional motion for summary judgment and that this opinion therefore concluded the case. <EM><A href=""http://columbia.us13.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=9906c7202590aac6a8bdbb7b9&amp;id=8c7b98afd2&amp;e=c70ad85e80"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Energy &amp; Environment Legal Institute v.

The court found that BLM adequately considered <mark>climate change</mark> impacts by generally considering global <mark>climate change</mark> and regional <mark>climate change</mark> trends. The court rejected the plaintiffs’ contention that BLM’s assessment should have included specific <mark>climate change</mark> data, finding that the plaintiffs had failed to point to any “hard data” that BLM should have included in its analysis. The court also agreed with BLM that new <mark>climate change</mark> studies indicating an increased risk of drought in the Southwest did not warrant preparation of a supplemental EIS. The court concluded that the studies provided “no new, raw data about how <mark>climate change</mark> might affect the pipeline’s environmental impact” and that BLM had already qualitatively considered the studies’ conclusions in its EIS. <EM><A href=""http://columbia.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9906c7202590aac6a8bdbb7b9&amp;id=1f224d9239&amp;e=c70ad85e80"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Center for Biological Diversity v.

Federal Court Upheld NOAA’s Withholding of Predecisional Documents Related to “Hiatus Study”</STRONG></P><P>The federal district court for the District of Columbia granted summary judgment to the U.S. Department of Commerce in a FOIA lawsuit seeking documents in the possession of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) related to a study by several NOAA scientists known as the “Hiatus Paper.” The Hiatus Paper found that recent ocean surface temperature increases were greater than other studies had indicated, and that there had been no “hiatus” in ocean warming as some had argued. The court’s decision concerned three sets of documents withheld by NOAA under FOIA’s Exemption 5 for inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters—drafts of the Hiatus Paper, internal correspondence among NOAA scientists about the Hiatus Paper, and outside peer reviewer comments. The court rejected the plaintiff’s contention that the withheld documents were not within Exemption 5’s scope because they concerned science, not policy. The district court said D.C. Circuit precedent resolved this question in NOAA’s favor. The court also found that the plaintiff had not presented evidence “sufficient to raise the specter of such nefarious government misconduct” as would be required to override Exemption 5. (The court also noted that the D.C. Circuit had never held that government misconduct could abrogate Exemption 5.) The district court also found that the Department of Commerce had adequately alleged that it had released all reasonably segregable material and that the plaintiff had provided no evidence to contradict those allegations. <EM><A href=""http://columbia.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9906c7202590aac6a8bdbb7b9&amp;id=36cbbe0d1b&amp;e=c70ad85e80"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their argument that the sea walls interfered with the nesting activities of endangered sea turtles and that the state authorization of the sea walls constituted a “take” under the Endangered Species Act. The court also found that the plaintiffs had established irreparable harm; that the balance of the equities tipped in their favor (here, the court said it was skeptical that the sea walls effectively prevented erosion); and that an injunction would be in the public interest. The court also denied a motion to dismiss, finding that dismissal on <EM>Burford</EM> abstention grounds due to ongoing state administrative proceedings was not justified. The court said that although “protecting coastal real estate from sea level rise and extreme <mark>climate</mark> events such as hurricanes is an important state policy,” abstention was not required merely because resolution of the federal question would result in overturning state policy. The court found that the defendants’ attempt to frame the issue as a local matter fell short since protection of endangered species was a matter of national concern. <EM><A href=""http://columbia.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9906c7202590aac6a8bdbb7b9&amp;id=1b7961b27f&amp;e=c70ad85e80"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Sierra Club v.

The court rejected an argument by the Province of Manitoba that a supplemental EIS prepared by the Bureau in 2015 did not adequately consider a <mark>climate change</mark>-induced increase in turbidity in the waters of Lake Sakakawea. The court said this argument arose from a “scientific disagreement as to the nature and impact” of the turbidity in the environment, not from a failure by the Bureau to consider the issue. <EM><A href=""http://columbia.us13.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=9906c7202590aac6a8bdbb7b9&amp;id=7a9eecfd48&amp;e=c70ad85e80"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Government of Province of Manitoba v.

Murray, the founder, chairman, president, and chief executive officer of Murray Energy; and affiliated companies of which Mr. Murray was the president, CEO, and sole director (the affiliated companies). The other defendants included Home Box Office, Inc. (HBO), a Delaware corporation, which broadcasts <EM>Last Week <SPAN class=""aBn""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">Tonight</SPAN></SPAN></EM>. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants were “persons and organizations fundamentally opposed to any revitalization of the coal industry, having described coal as ‘environmentally catastrophic.’” The plaintiffs further alleged that in a June 2017 episode of <EM>Last Week Night </EM>the defendants knowingly broadcast malicious statements that they knew to be false based on information provided by the plaintiffs. The statements that the plaintiffs alleged were defamatory included statements indicating that Mr. Murray had no evidence to support his assertion that an earthquake caused a mine collapse that killed nine people; a statement that Mr. Murray and Murray Energy “appear to be on the same side as black lung” and that their position on a coal dust regulation was the equivalent of rooting for bees to kill a child; and a description of Mr. Murray as looking “like a geriatric Dr. Evil.” The plaintiffs also asserted that the allegedly defamatory statements constituted false light invasion of privacy and that defendants intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon Mr. Murray. After the defendants removed the action to federal court on diversity jurisdiction grounds, the federal court remanded, rejecting the defendants’ argument that the affiliated companies—which, like HBO, are Delaware corporations—had been fraudulently joined to defeat diversity jurisdiction. The court found that defamatory statements made about an executive of a business could be sufficient to defame the business where the statements were made about the executive in his professional capacity and reflected negatively on the operation of the business. The court therefore found that there existed “a glimmer of hope” that the affiliated companies would establish a cause of action and that diversity jurisdiction therefore was destroyed. <EM><A href=""http://columbia.us13.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=9906c7202590aac6a8bdbb7b9&amp;id=b3bab00499&amp;e=c70ad85e80"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Marshall County Coal Co. v.

Alaska Oil and Gas Association (AOGA) and American Petroleum Institute (API) filed a separate petition. The petitioners identified the question presented as whether a species could be listed as threatened when the government determined that the species “is not presently endangered” but “will lose its habitat due to <mark>climate change</mark> by the end of the century.” The State of Alaska petitioners argued that the case isolated a single legal issue of “critical importance regarding the reach of the ESA” and that the case provided “an ideal vehicle” for reviewing the issue because the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) “based its listing decision entirely on the speculative, long-term effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on a healthy species,” the listing decision would take “a substantial, immediate toll on the State and its local population,” and the listing lacked positive conservation effects because NMFS “disclaimed any power to address the threat it purported to identify. The Alaska petitioners argued that NMFS had disregarded the statutory text and structure,” and that the agencies charged with implementing the ESA should not be allowed to “manhandle” the statute “to fit the square peg of <mark>climate change</mark> into the round hole of ESA regulation.” The Alaska petitioners said immediate review was necessary because neither the Ninth Circuit nor the D.C. Circuit was “likely to impose any effective limit on the listing of cold-weather species.”  In their petition, AOGA and API argued that the Ninth Circuit’s interpretation of the ESA allowing such a listing was incompatible with standards established by the Supreme Court and the D.C. Circuit and contrary to the statute’s plain language. The petitioners said certiorari should be granted to address the “palpable consequences for both public and private entities” that the Ninth Circuit’s “lax standard” would have and that the bearded seal listing presented “the perfect vehicle to set the Ninth Circuit’s erroneous standard straight” because the National Marine Fisheries Service had “conceded that it has <EM>no data</EM> to make a concrete inference about how the bearded seal will react to <mark>climate change</mark> and proceeded to list as threatened a highly abundant species that has shown no population decline despite observed sea ice declines.” The Alaska Federal of Natives, Resource Development Council for Alaska, Alaska Chamber, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and 18 states filed amicus briefs in support of the petitioners.<EM> <A href=""http://columbia.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9906c7202590aac6a8bdbb7b9&amp;id=7fd080ae39&amp;e=c70ad85e80"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Alaska v.

The Humane Society of the United States and the Fund for Animals alleged in their complaint that the FWS had ignored best available science showing that <mark>climate change</mark> was and would continue to threaten the survival of grizzly bears in the Yellowstone area, including by posing threats to grizzly bears’ food sources and forcing grizzly bears to migrate outside their primary conservation area and to face “cascading threats.” <EM><A href=""http://columbia.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9906c7202590aac6a8bdbb7b9&amp;id=fe94dba811&amp;e=c70ad85e80"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Humane Society of the United States v.

The complaint alleged numerous misrepresentations regarding the pipeline project, citing the campaign’s charges that the project was a “<mark>climate</mark> destroying project” that would ensure “guaranteed destruction of the planet,” which the complaint called “a sensational lie.” The complaint asserted that the enterprise had exploited “legitimate concerns about mitigating <mark>climate change</mark> to dupe the public into supporting a campaign that does the opposite” and that the exploitation “lays bare that [the enterprise] is motivated entirely by money, not its proclaimed concerns about environmental impacts.” Energy Transfer alleged that the “scheme’s dissemination of negative misinformation devastated the market reputation of Energy Transfer as well as the business relationships vital to its operations and growth.” In addition to racketeering and conspiracy counts under RICO, Energy Transfer also asserted claims of state law racketeering, defamation, tortious interference with business, and common law civil conspiracy. <EM><A href=""http://columbia.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9906c7202590aac6a8bdbb7b9&amp;id=e4ca003acd&amp;e=c70ad85e80"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. v.

In the 15 years before 2000, there were just six <mark>climate</mark>-related lawsuits filed in the United States. Since 2000, there have been <A href=""http://wordpress2.ei.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/us-<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">more than 1,000</A>. And this trend isn’t limited to the US. As of 2014, <mark>climate change</mark> cases had been filed in 12 countries, and by March 2017, <A href=""http://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/20767/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">that number had doubled</A>. Experts expect this upward trend to continue globally, especially as the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> increase.</P><P>Lawsuits have been an effective tactic in getting the federal government to address environmental issues for years. For example, in a landmark 2007 case the US Supreme Court sided with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in holding that the US Environmental Protection Agency is required to regulate CO<SUB>2</SUB>
 under the Clean Air Act.</P><P>“The courts I think are a traditional vehicle for litigants who aren’t getting relief through the [other] democratic branches of government,” says Steven Schwinn, a professor at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago. “My guess is the plaintiffs in these cases are not expecting a friendly reception in Congress or the White House, and so are turning to the courts.”</P><P>Government entities are the defendants in most <mark>climate change</mark> cases, but fossil fuel companies are increasingly being sued in “public nuisance” lawsuits like the California case. (New York City has also filed <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/01/10/new-york-city-sues-shell-exxonmobil-and-other-oil-majors-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change/?utm_term=.4aed8526925b"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">a similar high-profile suit</A>, as have other cities and counties around the country.)</P><P>While nuisance lawsuits are common cases for courts to handle, it is unusual for them to be applied to a threat as global and protracted as <mark>climate change</mark>. These cases are difficult to win, but they tend to bring public attention to the discussion in a way that serves <mark>climate</mark> activist goals, regardless of the verdict.</P><P>One long-shot case that has brought considerable media attention revolves around 21 young people who are suing federal agencies for failing to protect them. They’re claiming that federal policies ignored and exacerbated <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently <A href=""http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/377219-court-denies-trump-admins-plea-to-stop-kids-<mark>climate</mark>-lawsuit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">rejected a Trump administration motion</A> to dismiss the lawsuit, allowing discovery in the case (Juliana vs. United States) to continue.</P><P>By trying to legally force the federal government to take more action on <mark>climate change</mark>, the young plaintiffs may be asking the court to exceed its powers, experts say. But headlines highlighting “<mark>climate</mark> kids” suing the federal government have sparked interest among Americans who may not otherwise be interested in <mark>climate</mark>-related trials.</P><H2>A matter of tone</H2><P>Some experts caution that the inherently adversarial nature of courtroom discussions could deepen divisions around the already polarizing topic of <mark>climate change</mark>. “I’m afraid these lawsuits have become a vehicle for participating in polarized politics,” says Ernest Young, a professor at the Duke University School of Law in Durham, N.C.</P><P>But others see the courtroom as a more neutral forum where parties can set aside partisan rhetoric and communicate with each other in an orderly fashion.</P><P>Trial participants are “bound by procedural rules, by evidentiary rules, and there’s a neutral arbiter sitting in the front of the room, or on the side if it’s a trial by jury,” says Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Law at Columbia University in New York.</P><P>In such a formal setting, off-the-cuff theories, distractions, and distortions are less likely to gain traction. “Courts do hold the parties to higher standards of how they use science and evidence than [a legislature] certainly is held to,” agrees Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law. “If the science is relevant to the legal claims ... the judge will take it into account.”</P><P>As a result, all parties are more likely to agree about the basic science. That was already evident in the Bay Area-vs-oil companies courtroom tutorial, as Chevron's attorney, Mr. Boutrous, heavily cited the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) report. </P><P>All Boutrous did, essentially, was agree to play basketball on the same size court as his opponents. The two sides will still likely try to beat each other as the case continues. But that admission alone was a break from a long-held industry position casting doubt on human effects on the <mark>climate</mark>. Establishing consensus for even some the ground rules for discussion could set the case up to be a more productive and clarifying debate.</P><P>And it’s not just the explicit rules of a courtroom that could encourage more reasoned conversations, Mr. Burger says. “There’s something also about norms,” he says. “When you’re in a courtroom, as a lawyer, you want to convey to the judge that you’re a reliable narrator, that you can be trusted, that you are an honest participant in the judicial system. And when wild theories come to play in the courtroom, you run the risk of ruining any credibility you have.”</P><P>The courtroom discovery process can be an avenue to introduce new information into the public record, as happened during a series of lawsuits against tobacco companies in the 1980s and ’90s. In the tobacco cases, these revelations played a key role in shifting public opinion, which was followed by the widespread prohibition of smoking in public spaces. </P><P>Edward Maibach, director of George Mason University’s Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Communication, suggests the airing of facts during <mark>climate</mark> trials could have similar effects.</P><H2>'People want somebody to take responsibility'</H2><P>Court cases could also bring a sense of urgency to the topic of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Although the majority (69 percent) of Americans don’t dispute that <mark>climate change</mark> is happening, according to <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>communication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016/?est=happening&amp;type=value&amp;geo=county"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">survey data</A> compiled by the Yale Program on <mark>Climate Change</mark> Communication in New Haven, they also largely see it as a distant problem (38 percent do not expect <mark>climate change</mark> will harm them personally). But recent nuisance cases highlight immediate effects that feel close to home for many Americans.</P><P>“They’re suing on the basis of costs incurred now, damages already accrued,” Professor Maibach says. “By its very nature, that is basically saying, ‘No, this isn’t a distant problem in space and time. This is a problem that’s creating problems and costing us money here in our town now.’ ”</P><P>GW's Dr. McCormick, who has researched trends within these <mark>climate change</mark> cases, says the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> already experienced, especially extreme weather events, may be a significant driver behind the increase in such cases. Natural disasters cost the US an estimated $306 billion in 2017, the <A href=""https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2018/0208/Natural-disasters-2017-costliest-year"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">most expensive year</A> on record.</P><P>“These impacts are incredibly costly, both economically and in terms of our lived experience in the world, in terms of our lives. People are dying. There’s nothing more serious. So we want someone to stop it,” she says. “People want somebody to take responsibility.”</P><P>During the courtroom tutorial last month in San Francisco, the lecture given by University of California, Santa Cruz, <mark>climate</mark> scientist Gary Griggs was underscored by a coincidence. Just as Professor Griggs was explaining recent studies on changing flood frequencies, an alarm sounded. Judge Alsup knew just what it was.</P><P>“Coastal flood alert,” he said. It was a monthly test of the system.</P><P>[<B>Editor’s note: </B><I>This story has been updated to clarify the full extent of allegations in the case </I>Juliana vs. United States.]</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV id=""story-bottom""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""content-bound small-centered small-11 medium-9 large-8 columns""><DIV id=""related-stories"" class=""eza-related_external_links""><H2>Next Up</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

</FIGURE><P>SAN FRANCISCO — Lawyers for some of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, and attorneys representing two Bay Area cities are set to descend on San Francisco Wednesday for what’s expected to be a courtroom first: A daylong lesson on the latest science on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>U.S. District Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California is overseeing a public nuisance lawsuit that the cities of Oakland and San Francisco <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/403/12194/<mark>Climate</mark>-Change-Complaint.pdf"" target=""_blank"">filed last fall</A> against six fossil fuel giants: BP plc, <mark>Chevron Corp.</mark>, ConocoPhillips Co., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell plc. The two waterfront cities are seeking to hold the oil companies liable for the cost of infrastructure upgrades and remediation expected as they deal with effects of rising sea levels.</P><P>In much the same way the judge does in complex technology cases, Alsup has <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/403/documents/403/12194/2018.02.27-135-Notice-re-Tutorial.pdf"">asked the parties</A> for a tutorial. Alsup held a similar session on the laser science underpinning Waymo’s autonomous vehicle trade secret lawsuit against Uber Technologies Inc. and even asked the lawyers handling the litigation challenging the Trump administration’s rollback of the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals to bring him up to speed on the program.</P><P>In the global warming case, Alsup has asked both sides to “trace the history of scientific study of <mark>climate change</mark>” and fill him in on “the best science now available.” Since his initial order asking for the tutorial late last month, Alsup has proposed some <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/403/documents/403/12194/2018.02.27-135-Notice-re-Tutorial.pdf"" target=""_blank"">more specific questions</A>. For example: “Apart from <mark>CO2</mark>, what happens to the collective heat from tail pipe exhausts, engine radiators, and all other heat from combustion of fossil fuels? How, if at all, does this collective heat contribute to warming of the atmosphere?”</P><P>The oil companies’ lengthy line-up of defense counsel filed <A href=""https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/403/documents/403/12194/AS-FILED-Motion-to-Dismiss-and-Memo-2018.03.20.pdf"" target=""_blank"">a motion to dismiss</A> on Tuesday on the eve of the hearing, which argues a lawsuit is the wrong venue to address global issues like <mark>climate change</mark>. They also argued the emission of greenhouse gasses at the root of the plaintiffs claims are the sort of issue Congress has delegated to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</P><P>“At bottom, plaintiffs are trying to regulate the nationwide—indeed, worldwide—activity of companies that play a key role in virtually every sector of the global economy by supplying the fuels that enable production and <mark>innovation</mark>, literally keep the lights and heat on, power nearly every form of transportation, and form the basic materials from which innumerable consumer, technological, and medical devices are fashioned,” the companies’ lawyers wrote. “The complaints contradict numerous federal statutes and raise myriad constitutional issues.”</P><P>Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, Susman Godfrey and Stern Kilcullen &amp; Rufolo represent Chevron, Arnold &amp; Porter Kaye Scholer represent BP, King &amp; Spalding represents ConocoPhillips, O’Melveny &amp; Myers and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison represent Exxon, and Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson represent Royal Dutch Shell.</P><P>Despite the forceful arguments in the motion to dismiss, the company’s aren’t expected to quibble with the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark> and its human causes.</P><P>Gibson Dunn’s Avi Garbow, who was the EPA’s general counsel during the Obama administration, said Chevron plans to point Alsup to conclusions from the 2013 “Fifth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>,” which formed the scientific underpinning for the Paris Agreement. That includes, Garbow said, the report’s conclusion that it is “extremely likely” human influence has been the dominant cause of warming since the middle of the 20th century. Garbow said that Chevron is ”neither going to understate or overstate” the degree of confidence scientists have on their conclusions about the earth’s changing <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>Matthew Pawa, one of the cities’ outside lawyers at Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, forwarded a request for comment to the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office. In an emailed statement, City Attorney Dennis Herrera said San Francisco looks forward to presenting the science and making its case.</P><P>“We’ll see whether Big Oil acknowledges the scientific consensus and its role in causing <mark>climate change</mark> or doubles down, once again, on deception,” Herrera said. “These companies knew their products were causing sea level rise, and they deceived people about it. Now, that bill has come due.”</P></DIV><BUTTON class=""load_more_shelf btn"">Load More </BUTTON><DIV id=""share-tools-btm"" class=""col-lg-12""><DIV id=""bottom-share"" class=""share-tools text-center""><BUTTON class=""btn tw""> share on twitter</BUTTON></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""author-bio"" id=""about_the_author""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12""><H2 class=""section-title"">Ross Todd</H2></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12""><P>Ross Todd is bureau chief of The Recorder in San Francisco.

Plaintiffs claimed these actions created a public nuisance and sought both injunctive relief and damages.</P><P><STRONG>Looking Ahead</STRONG>: There is now a lack of consensus as to whether these global warming cases should be in federal or state court.</P><P>In direct contradiction to the court's opinion in <EM>The People of the State of California v. BP P.L.C.</EM> a month earlier, a different court in the Northern District of California remanded three &quot;global warming&quot; actions back to California state court. <EM>County of San Mateo v. <mark>Chevron Corp.</mark></EM>, <EM>City of Imperial Beach v. <mark>Chevron Corp.</mark></EM>, <EM>County of Marin v. <mark>Chevron Corp<</mark>/EM>.</P><P>The County of San Mateo, the County of Marin, and the City of Imperial Beach filed suits in California state court against many of the top producers and sellers of fossil fuels worldwide claiming that the defendants knew that emissions from the fuels they produced and marketed created greenhouse gas <mark>pollution</mark> that has caused and will cause serious environmental impacts on the people of California, including flooding events and severe storms. Plaintiffs in these suits brought causes of action for public nuisance and strict liability. The defendants removed the cases to federal court.</P><P>In its remand opinion, the court granted the plaintiffs' motions to remand the proceedings back to state court because it found that removal based on the application of federal common law was not warranted. This court disagreed with the court in <EM>The People of the State of California v. BP P.L.C.</EM> and found that the Ninth Circuit decision in <EM>Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp.</EM> was directly applicable to the case. The court noted significant similarities between <EM>Kivalina</EM> and the instant matter, including the types of claims brought, types of damages sought, and the defendants named.</P><P>Based on these similarities, the court interpreted <EM>Kivalina</EM> to stand for the proposition that the federal common law is displaced by the federal Clean Air Act for both global warming related claims against direct emitters and energy producers. As a result, the court held that the plaintiffs' claims were not governed by federal common law and that federal common law did not preclude plaintiffs from asserting their state law claims.</P><P>The court then held that removal was also not warranted because: (i) the state claims were not completely preempted by any federal law; (ii) there was no actual, disputed, substantial federal issue requiring <EM>Grable</EM> jurisdiction; and (iii) no specialized statutory removal provision was applicable.</P><P>After determining that removal was not appropriate, the court stayed the matter for 42 days to allow the parties to consider whether the matter should be certified for interlocutory appeal or whether the remand order should be stayed pending appeal of the earlier remand order. The court requested a briefing schedule from the parties within seven days of the ruling.</P><P>The result of this ruling is that there is now no consensus, at least within the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as to whether these suits brought by cities and counties in California against fossil fuel producers for global warming impacts should be in federal or state court. There are now rulings on each side of the issue that could be used by defendants and plaintiffs in other similar suits.</P><P><STRONG>Key Takeaway</STRONG></P><OL><LI>There is no consensus, at least within the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as to whether suits brought by cities and counties in California against fossil fuel producers for global warming impacts should be in federal or state court.</LI></OL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

They just don’t think they can be <A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/20/17031676/<mark>climate</mark>-change-lawsuits-fossil-fuel-new-york-santa-cruz"">sued for it</A>. </P><P id=""OTQQJg"">“Chevron accepts what the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>] has reached consensus on concerning science and <mark>climate change</mark>,” said <A href=""https://www.chambersandpartners.com/USA/person/196823/theodore-j-boutrous-jr"">Theodore Boutrous</A>, who represents Chevron and is heading up the assorted legal team for the five oil companies that are defendants in this lawsuit. But, he said, that didn’t mean that a civil lawsuit was the right way to address <mark>climate change</mark>. “It’s a global issue that requires global action,” he said.</P><P id=""bQDMpU"">Over the course of two hours, Boutrous ran through the findings of <A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/"">the most recent IPCC report (released in 2013)</A>, acknowledging that global temperatures were rising due to <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide caused by human activity, that other factors were negligible, and that as a result, sea levels were rising. No time was given to any denials of <mark>climate</mark> science, with Boutrous sticking closely to the substance of the IPCC report. Even his attempt at implying that his client was not at fault was framed within the substance of the IPCC report; he said that the report never said “extraction or production” of oil was the cause of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions, but rather the “economic activity” that burned fossil fuels. </P><DIV class=""c-float-right c-float-hang""><ASIDE id=""XdkpXa""><Q>Major oil companies went on the record to say that human-caused <mark>climate change</mark> is real</Q></ASIDE></DIV><P id=""AlPob4""><A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber"">Judge William Alsup</A>, who is presiding over the lawsuit, is giving the other oil companies — ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell, and BP — a week to quibble with anything Boutrous said in court about <mark>climate change</mark>. “Chevron welcomes meaningful efforts to address the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>, but litigation is not an appropriate tool for accomplishing that objective,” Sean Comey, a spokesperson for Chevron, said in an emailed statement to <EM>The Verge</EM>. “Chevron provided a neutral assessment of the science based on the most recent comprehensive scientific assessment.” The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </P><P id=""YbIuy5"">Wednesday’s session was not a trial, or really even a hearing in the typical sense of the word. It was, in Judge Alsup’s terminology, a “tutorial” — a session in which the legal teams for both sides present background facts for his edification. It’s not discovery, it’s not evidence, and just because it was presented Wednesday, it’s not necessarily admissible for a jury in the future should this case go to trial. Nonetheless, the hearing marked a moment in which major oil companies went on the record to say that human-caused <mark>climate change</mark> is real. At this point, the science is so undeniable that it no longer makes sense for oil companies to try and refute it. </P><DIV class=""c-float-left c-float-hang""><ASIDE id=""twRP59""><Q>“Rhetorical claims don’t cut the mustard.”</Q></ASIDE></DIV><P id=""PHD2SI"">This is the first time Judge Alsup — or any judge, really — has held a <mark>climate change</mark> tutorial. These types of sessions are not typical in the legal system, but Alsup has requested tutorials in other cases in the past, including tutorials on immigration for a <A href=""https://www.vox.com/2018/1/10/16872766/daca-trump-court-ruling-renew"">DACA case</A> and LIDAR for the <EM>Waymo v. Uber</EM> case. Alsup’s approach to science has not gone unappreciated in this case. <A href=""http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/people/mallen.html"">Myles Allen</A>, a <mark>climate</mark> scientist from the University of Oxford, who presented before the judge on Wednesday, says, “The court is evidently taking our science as seriously as they’re taking the science involved in patent law cases, where the court really does have to understand the technicalities and where rhetorical claims don’t cut the mustard.” </P><P id=""0iXJ6b"">At the start of the tutorial, Alsup warned the press, “You will probably find this boring,” reiterating that this was all so “the poor judge can learn some science.” (Judge Alsup was previously an engineering major at Mississippi State, ultimately graduating with a math degree.) Although Alsup promised that “if you get bored, you can just leave,” the throng of observers that packed the gallery and an additional overflow room barely thinned through a five-hour session that started early in the morning. </P><P id=""BbGKAN"">Lawyers for the cities of San Francisco and Oakland were largely silent at the tutorial, with <A href=""https://www.hbsslaw.com/attorneys/managing-partner/steve-w-berman-managing-partner"">Steve Berman</A>, representing the San Francisco city attorney’s office, stepping up to the podium only to introduce <mark>climate</mark> scientist after <mark>climate</mark> scientist. </P><P id=""sUzHkg"">Only Boutrous spoke on the defendants’ side, not bothering to bring on any scientists to speak for the oil companies. Boutrous appeared to have studied the IPCC’s 2013 AR5 report from start to finish, and he stuck closely to what he characterized as the scientific consensus. (When it was his turn, <A href=""https://www.atmos.illinois.edu/cms/One.aspx?siteId=127458&amp;pageId=151986"">Don Weubbles</A> of the University of Illinois sniped at the limited scope of Boutrous’ presentation, saying pointedly that “science did not stop” after 2013.)</P><P id=""9mZVIz"">It became swiftly apparent that the judge was taking the opportunity to satisfy his curiosity on absolutely anything that had occurred to him, prompting Allen at one point to spread his arms out in a wobbling motion to describe the motion of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide molecules when they absorb infrared radiation. At another point, Judge Alsup and Allen went on a long, wandering detour about whether the relationship between two variables was logarithmic or linear. </P><P id=""9CiSTP"">The wide range of questions put Boutrous at a disadvantage. At one point, the judge interrupted him with a question about undersea lava flows and ocean temperatures, citing an interesting “geology show” he had seen on television a few weeks ago. Because this fell far outside the scope of any of the presentations or the IPCC report, his question went unanswered.</P><P id=""Hgl65f"">The unnamed geology show wasn’t the only kind of preparation that Alsup had made. He also mentioned that he had rewatched <EM>An Inconvenient Truth</EM>, and acknowledged that he had been reading several books on <mark>climate</mark> science and its history, even challenging Boutrous at one point about a scientist that he had left out in his rundown of the history of <mark>climate</mark> science. </P><P id=""RZzoTc"">“You jumped over 1938. Who was in 1938?” he asked the lawyer. </P><P id=""RClF1W"">“... 1938?” Boutrous asked. </P><P id=""lei3kE"">“There was a guy named <A href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-22283372"">Callendar</A>,” Alsup prompted. “The <A href=""https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springer.com%2Fla%2Fbook%2F9781935704041"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Callendar effect</A> is named after him.” </P><P id=""oA3D2w"">The science experts didn’t seem used to lecturing to a single student who is completely unabashed about asking any question that pops into his head. They occasionally had trouble indulging or recovering from tangential lines of questions, but still, they had a wider range of knowledge to draw from when put on the spot. Although Boutrous — a noted Supreme Court litigator — couldn’t answer questions about undersea lava flows or why the rise of sea water is inconsistent across the planet, he was at least at ease with a judicial style of questioning, and his strategy was clear: if the oil companies were going to go on the record with a vocal acceptance of <mark>climate</mark> science, they would take the opportunity to have a professional rhetorician sow doubt about where oil companies fit into the blame game. </P><P id=""9ZzoWG"">The thrust of Boutrous’ presentation wasn’t that <mark>climate</mark> science was wrong — he, too, took a turn running through graphs showing the precipitous rise in global temperatures and sea levels — but he also took care to show the rate of emissions in China and India, lingering particularly on a graph that said that China’s emissions currently exceed the United States. He said that this was largely due to the burning of coal, which is being reduced in the US. In fact, Boutrous even credited hydraulic fracking with reducing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions in the US. </P><P id=""7kWay5"">Boutrous seemed to say that fossil fuel companies aren’t responsible for how people use their products. “IPCC doesn’t say that the extraction or production of fossil fuels leads to emissions,” Boutrous said. “It’s energy use, the economic activity, that drives the demand for fuel that leads to emissions.” </P><DIV class=""c-float-right c-float-hang""><ASIDE id=""jaBI15""><Q>“We’re just making the cigarettes, people are choosing to smoke.”</Q></ASIDE></DIV><P id=""1nRNEu"">It’s an argument we’ve heard before from tobacco companies, says <A href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/about/staff/staff/peter-frumhoff.html#.WrL1eJPwZE4"">Peter Frumhoff</A>, chief <mark>climate</mark> scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Tobacco companies for years said that ‘We’re just making the cigarettes; people are choosing to smoke,’” Frumhoff says. And for years, courts sided with the companies, he says — until public opinion began to change. “It was the consequence of their efforts to disinform that led juries and judges — who are members of the public — to say, ‘Wait a minute,’” Frumhoff says. The lawsuit itself says bluntly that the defendants “borrowed the Big Tobacco playbook in order to promote their products.” The complaint accuses the oil companies of “promoting massive use of fossil fuels by misleading the public about global warming by emphasizing the uncertainties of <mark>climate</mark> science.” </P><P id=""xwPvRW"">In response, Boutrous’ presentation on the history of <mark>climate</mark> science focused on the controversy around the theory that <mark>climate change</mark> was caused by humans. Chevron may be willing to say <EM>now </EM>that <mark>climate change</mark> was caused by humans, but surely it wasn’t wrong to say otherwise <EM>then</EM>. For example, both Boutrous and Allen mentioned Swedish chemist <A href=""https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Arrhenius/"">Svante Arrhenius</A> who, at the turn of the 20th century, grew increasingly concerned that anthropogenic <mark>carbon</mark> emissions could increase global temperatures. </P><P id=""uVBCze"">But Boutrous took time to emphasize that, until about the 1960s, most scientists didn’t believe him. This isn’t strictly <EM>wrong</EM> — although Judge Alsup himself noted that in 1938, <A href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-22283372"">Guy Callendar</A> linked <mark>climate change</mark> to anthropogenic <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions. Even <A href=""https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Arrhenius/"">NASA’s Earth Observatory</A> agrees that Arrhenius was largely disregarded until the second half of the century. “It’s trial and error. Scientists debating each other,” Boutrous said in court. “Questioning other scientists’ views is part of the scientific process.” (Boutrous did not call any scientific experts on behalf of the oil companies to speak before Judge Alsup Wednesday about how the scientific process is conducted or anything else.) </P><DIV class=""c-float-left c-float-hang""><ASIDE id=""nxGjzN""><Q>“What’s actually said is not nearly as important as what the evidence is to support it.” </Q></ASIDE></DIV><P id=""ItbI3K"">Boutrous drew quotes from IPCC reports across the years, showing the increasingly strong language that was used to characterize its conclusions about <mark>climate change</mark>. In 1995, the IPCC said that “the balance of evidence suggests” human-caused <mark>climate change</mark>, the 2007 report goes with the phrase “very likely,” and by 2013, it becomes “extremely likely.”In other words, the oil companies are emphasizing that it’s taken time for scientists to reach a consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>. It’s a strategy that <mark>climate</mark> law expert <A href=""http://columbia<mark>climate</mark>law.com/about-us/our-team/jessica-wentz/"">Jessica Wentz</A> at Columbia Law School was expecting. “Not directly attacking the science, but undermining it by emphasizing uncertainty,” she says.</P><P id=""NFNz7E"">The legalistic reading of the IPCC’s statements was frustrating to Allen, he said in an interview with <EM>The Verge </EM>after the tutorial concluded, because to scientists, the evidence and context are more important than the language. “The question of whether somebody writing a scientific paper uses the word ‘likely’ or ‘very likely’ is kind of neither here nor there,” Allen says. “What’s actually said is not nearly as important as what the evidence is to support it.” </P><P id=""q72IlX"">Still, on the basic facts, the two sides agreed more than they disagreed — which kept arguments over whether or not <mark>climate change</mark> was real from derailing the hearing. This wasn’t for lack of trying on the part of the deniers: academics <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/15/trump-science-adviser-william-happer-<mark>climate</mark>-change-cult"">William Happer</A>, <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/06032017/<mark>climate</mark>-change-denial-scientists-richard-lindzen-mit-donald-trump"">Richard S.

RELEASE</STRONG><STRONG>Media Contact: </STRONG><A href=""mailto:cnemati@asyousow.org"">Cyrus Nemati,</A> (510) 735-8157</P><P>Today, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released a crucial decision holding that <mark>Chevron Corp.</mark> must respond to shareholders’ <mark>climate</mark> risk related shareholder proposals and cannot exclude them from the ballot at the company’s annual meeting.  The first proposal asks Chevron to report how it plans to transition its business model to remain successful in a rapidly de<mark>carbon</mark>izing energy economy. The low <mark>carbon</mark> business model resolution was filed by shareholder representatives <EM>As You Sow </EM>andArjuna Capital along with co-filers American Baptist Home Mission Society and Zevin Asset Management<EM>. </EM></P><P>The SEC further upheld a shareholder proposal asking the company to report on its actions to reduce fugitive methane emissions. Methane is 86 times more <mark>climate</mark> intensive than <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide over a 20-year period, so reducing emissions from oil and gas operations is crucial to maintaining global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. <EM>As You Sow </EM>filed the methane proposal along with co-filers Dominican Sisters of Hope, Congregation of St. Joseph, Adrian Dominican Sisters, and Dignity Health.</P><P>Chevron argued to the SEC that global warming lawsuits -- filed against the company by cities, states, children, and other groups harmed by global warming -- should preclude any <mark>climate change</mark> inquiry from shareholders, claiming that such inquiry would strategically harm their legal case.</P><P>“Had Chevron prevailed in its argument, shareholder inquiries about one of the most important issues of the century would be excluded from consideration,” said Danielle Fugere, President of <EM>As You Sow.</EM> “The SEC rightfully declined to allow Chevron to muzzle shareholders.”</P><P>Natasha Lamb, managing partner, Arjuna Capital, said, “The clock is ticking on how Big Oil will respond to <mark>climate change</mark> and Chevron can’t choose to hide behind a stack of litigation.  Investors have the right to know how the company will adapt its business to <mark>climate</mark> risks.” </P><P>The low <mark>carbon</mark> business model resolution and methane resolution are expected to go to a vote at Chevron’s annual meeting in late May.</P><P style=""text-align:center"">###</P><P><EM><A href=""https://www.asyousow.org/""><EM>As You Sow</EM></A></EM><EM> is a nonprofit organization that promotes environmental and social corporate responsibility through shareholder advocacy, coalition building, and innovative legal strategies.

The scale of historical emissions associated with these fossil fuel producers is large enough to have contributed significantly to <mark>climate change</mark>, according to the report.</P><P> ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron are identified as among the highest emitting investor-owned companies since 1988. If fossil fuels continue to be extracted at the same rate over the next 28 years as they were between 1988 and 2017, says the report, global average temperatures would be on course to rise by 4C by the end of the century. This is likely to have <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/31/planet-will-warm-4c-2100-<mark>climate</mark>"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">catastrophic consequences</A> including substantial species extinction and global food scarcity risks.</P><P>While companies have a huge role to play in driving <mark>climate change</mark>, says Faria, the barrier is the “absolute tension” between short-term profitability and the urgent need to reduce emissions.</P><P>A <A href=""http://www.<mark>carbon</mark>tracker.org/report/stranded-assets-danger-zone/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""><mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker study</A> in 2015 found that fossil fuel companies risked wasting <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/25/fossil-fuel-companies-risk-wasting-2tn-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">more than $2tn</A> over the coming decade by pursuing coal, oil and gas projects that could be worthless in the face of international action on <mark>climate change</mark> and advances in renewables – in turn posing substantial threats to investor returns.</P><P>CDP says its aims with the <mark>carbon</mark> majors project are both to improve transparency among fossil fuel producers and to help investors understand the emissions associated with their fossil fuel holdings. </P><P>A fifth of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions are backed by public investment, according to the report. “That puts a significant responsibility on those investors to engage with <mark>carbon</mark> majors and urge them to disclose <mark>climate</mark> risk,” says Faria.</P><P>Investors should move out of fossil fuels, says Michael Brune, executive director of US environmental organisation the Sierra Club. “Not only is it morally risky, it’s economically risky. The world is moving away from fossil fuels towards clean energy and is doing so at an accelerated pace. Those left holding investments in fossil fuel companies will find their investments becoming more and more risky over time.”</P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-2 | 2""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">G20 public finance for fossil fuels 'is four times more than renewables'</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P>There is a “growing wave of companies that are acting in the opposite manner to the companies in this report,” says Brune. Nearly 100 companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Ikea have committed to 100% renewable power under the <A href=""http://re100.org/companies"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">RE100 initiative</A>. <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/05/volvo-cars-electric-hybrid-2019"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Volvo recently announced</A> that all its cars would be electric or hybrid from 2019. </P><P>And oil and gas companies are also embarking on green investments.

A BP spokesperson says its “determined to be part of the solution” for <mark>climate change</mark> and is “investing in renewables and low-<mark>carbon</mark> <mark>innovation</mark>.” And ExxonMobil, which has faced <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-<mark>climate</mark>-change-1981-<mark>climate</mark>-denier-funding"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">heavy criticism</A> for its environmental record, has been <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/21/oil-majors-investments-renewable-energy-solar-wind"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">exploring <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage</A>.</P><P>But for many the sums involved and pace of change are nowhere near enough. A research paper published last year by Paul Stevens, an academic at think tank Chatham House, said international oil companies were no longer fit for purpose and warned these multinationals that they faced a <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/oil-firms-environment-energy-<mark>climate</mark>-change"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">“nasty, brutish and short” end</A> within the next 10 years if they did not completely change their business models. </P><P>Investors now have a choice, according to Charlie Kronick, senior programme advisor at Greenpeace UK. “The future of the oil industry has already been written: the choice is will its decline be managed, returning capital to shareholders to be reinvested in the genuine industries of the future, or will they hold on, hoping not be the last one standing when the music stops?”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Executives often urge shareholders to vote down such resolutions, and there are concerns this year that the administration's positions could lead to even more complacency, by both companies and their investors.</P><P>Perhaps the most susceptible to ripples of the administration's assault on <mark>climate</mark> and environment policies this year are the nearly two dozen resolutions focused on methane emissions and on the impact of measures limiting global temperature rise caused by burning fossil fuels.</P><H3>Limiting Methane Emissions – or Not</H3><P>At least six oil, gas and electric utility companies, including Chevron, are facing shareholder resolutions calling on executives to explain the steps they're taking to minimize <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/16022018/methane-leaks-oil-natural-gas-data-global-warming-pennsylvania-edf-study"">emissions of methane</A>, a <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/tags/short-lived-<mark>climate</mark>-pollutants"">short-lived <mark>climate</mark> pollutant</A> that's one of the most potent greenhouse gases.</P><P>While investor groups raise concerns, however, the Trump administration has embarked on a mission—cheered on by organizations like the <A href=""http://www.api.org/"">American Petroleum Institute</A>—to roll back most of the Obama-era requirements for reducing emissions of methane from oil and gas drilling on federal land.</P><P>Companies that might be tempted to see the current administration's behavior as an excuse to delay acting on <mark>climate</mark> risks should be cautious—administrations change, and the oil and gas industry in particular is built on investments that require weighting risks decades into the future, said Danielle Fugere, president of <A href=""https://www.asyousow.org/"">As You Sow</A>, a non-profit shareholder advocacy organization. </P><P>&quot;Investors today are becoming more and more sophisticated when they think about a company's <mark>sustainable</mark> future and what that means to their investments,&quot; said <A href=""https://www.asyousow.org/staff/danielle-fugere"">Fugere</A>, whose group <A href=""https://www.proxypreview.org/"">released a report</A> on Thursday with <mark>Sustainable</mark> Investments Institute and Proxy Impact tracking this year's <mark>climate</mark>-related shareholder resolutions. </P><P>&quot;Investments will be made with companies that have a plan for the future; a plan that accounts for a de<mark>carbon</mark>izing economy where companies are making adjustments to remain competitive,&quot; she said.</P><H3>Assessing Risk in a 2-Degree World</H3><P>A block of shareholders led by the Presbyterian Church filed the resolution asking <A href=""https://www.nblenergy.com/"">Noble </A>for an assessment of the impact its portfolios would face from policies and technologies that keep warming under 2 degrees Celsius.</P><P>It's one of at least 18 shareholder resolutions this year calling on oil, gas and electric utility companies to conduct a 2-degree scenario analysis.</P><P>&quot;A 2-degree scenario analysis of Noble Energy's future plans will generate a more complete picture of current and future risks and opportunities than business-as-usual planning,&quot; <A href=""https://tools.ceres.org/resources/tools/resolutions/noble-energy-2-degree-scenario-analysis-2018/@@s3_view"">the church's resolution</A> states. &quot;This report will help Noble identify both vulnerabilities and opportunities for its business and reassure investors that Noble is poised to manage and take advantage of future regulatory, technological and market changes.&quot;</P><P>It would be shortsighted of Noble to make decisions based on the Trump Administration's devotion to fossil fuels, said Rob Fohr, director of <A href=""https://www.presbyterianmission.org/ministries/mrti/"">Faith-Based Investing and Corporate Engagement </A>for the Presbyterian Church.</P><P>&quot;In the short term, I can see where the company has a lot to be excited about,&quot; Fohr said. &quot;But for the long term, it's not prudent to make plans based on the activities of one administration.&quot;</P><P>Shareholders in Kinder Morgan, the largest pipeline and petroleum storage company in North America, are similarly pressing the company for answers about how it is planning for the risks and opportunities presented by goals established by the Paris Agreement.</P><P>The company acknowledged in a <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1506307/000150630717000008/kmi-2016x10k.htm"">2016 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</A> that &quot;greenhouse gas regulations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.&quot; An investor group led by Zevin Asset Management wants to know what <A href=""https://www.kindermorgan.com/"">Kinder Morgan</A> is doing about it.</P><P>&quot;Currently, our company only provides business-as-usual planning and risk analysis, which is not sufficient to prepare for a set of risks as large and complex as <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; <A href=""https://tools.ceres.org/resources/tools/resolutions/kinder-morgan-disclose-direct-and-indirect-lobbying/@@s3_view"">the shareholder resolution</A> states. &quot;The requested report will reassure investors that KMI is poised to manage and take advantage of future regulatory, technological, and market changes.&quot;</P><H3>More Investors – and Companies – Respond</H3><P>Last year, investors in Exxon and Occidental Petroleum Corp. broke through with successful shareholder votes on resolutions seeking annual disclosures that take into account what part of a company's oil and gas portfolio remains economically viable in the face of global efforts to limit global warming. Exxon's shareholders, who had voted down similar resolutions in the past, tipped to <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/31052017/exxon-shareholder-<mark>climate</mark>-change-disclosure-resolution-approved"">62 percent in favor</A> of disclosure.</P><P>&quot;Shareholder engagement has ratcheted up to a new level with enhanced collaborations and strategies, even as some corporate leaders determined to undercut basic shareholder rights have a sympathetic ear in Washington,&quot; Andrew Behar, CEO of As You Sow, wrote in the <A href=""https://www.proxypreview.org/"">report on 2018 shareholder resolutions</A>.</P><P>Under the mounting pressure, <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/05022018/exxon-<mark>climate</mark>-risk-report-oil-reserves-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-goals-electric-vehicles"">Exxon released a report</A> earlier this year addressing the risks the company faces from <mark>climate change</mark> and from government efforts to rein in <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions from fossil fuels, though some shareholders believe it fell short.</P><P>In a presentation to investment analysts Wednesday, Exxon officials discussed their projection for modest efficiency gains and shifts to lower-<mark>carbon</mark> sources over the next two decades—and for continued strong global demand for fossil fuel. &quot;Why keep investing in the oil and gas business?&quot; asked Pete Trelenberg, the company's manager of environmental policy and planning. &quot;Well, because there's demand.&quot;</P><P>Occidental has <A href=""https://www.thestreet.com/story/14421477/1/occidental-to-produce-<mark>climate</mark>-risk-report-in-2018.html"">pledged</A> to also to issue a report on the risks that <mark>climate change</mark> poses to its business no later than June. And other companies, including ConocoPhillips, have voluntarily agreed to perform such assessments.</P><P>In the face of pending resolutions this year, <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/midwestern-utilities-agree-to-<mark>climate</mark>-assessments-949976dd2a68/"">two coal-reliant electric</A> <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/midwestern-utilities-agree-to-<mark>climate</mark>-assessments-949976dd2a68/"">utilities</A> in the Midwest—WEC Energy Group and CMS Energy Corp.—agreed to publish assessments of the long-term business impacts on their companies of limiting global warming to under 2 degrees</P><P>Oil and gas companies in particular face tremendous pressure to accurately identify long-term capital projects that are essential to the growth and prosperity of the business, Fohr said. An oil company that banks on future projects—new oil fields, new refineries—without fully calculating all risk factors puts itself and its investors in jeopardy.</P><P>&quot;A wrong assumption about the future because of one administration's friendly oil and gas position that leads to misallocation of capital puts the company at risk for stranded assets in the future,&quot; Fohr said.</P><H3>Another Worry: Where's the Lobbying Money Going?</H3><P>One of the biggest shareholders demands outside of direct <mark>climate</mark> impact is for more information about companies' political lobbying. Shareholders in at least 11 oil and gas companies and electric utilities want to know how company money is being spent to influence public policy—including on <mark>climate</mark>-related issues, according to the new report and shareholder resolution tracking by <A href=""https://www.ceres.org/"">Ceres</A>.</P><P>The resolutions cite millions of dollars spent by the companies to flex their public policy muscle. <A href=""https://tools.ceres.org/resources/tools/resolutions/disclose-direct-and-indirect-lobbying-2/@@s3_view"">Exxon</A> and <A href=""https://tools.ceres.org/resources/tools/resolutions/disclose-direct-and-indirect-lobbying-1/@@s3_view"">Chevron</A>, for example, spent more than $94 million and $70 million respectively since 2010 on federal lobbying to influence political thinking and public perception, according to the resolutions.</P><P>Some of the resolutions call out companies for financially supporting organization such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the American Petroleum Institute and Koch Groups—all with a history of fighting <mark>climate</mark> policies. The shareholders argue that associating with anti-<mark>climate</mark> organizations damages a company's reputation and could adversely affect stock value.</P><P>If money is spent to purchase influence, it should pay for efforts to promote policies that call for mitigating and adapting to <mark>climate change</mark>, reduce the use of fossil fuels and focus on renewable energy, shareholders wrote in a <A href=""https://tools.ceres.org/resources/tools/resolutions/report-on-public-policy-advocacy-related-to-energy-policy-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change/@@s3_view"">resolution filed with Devon Energy</A>.</P><P>Last year, Devon executives <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090012/000119312517137053/d335277ddef14a.htm#toc335277_70"">told shareholders</A> in recommending a &quot;no&quot; vote on a similar resolution that the company was &quot;committed to conducting our business lawfully, ethically and in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. ... We also believe that participation in the political, legislative and regulatory processes—at all levels of government—is vital to our business.&quot;</P><P>Exxon, in urging a &quot;no&quot; vote on a political spending disclosure resolution last year, <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000119312517122538/d182248ddef14a.htm#toc182248_21"">wrote</A> that its activities &quot;comply fully with the spirit and letter of all federal and state lobby disclosure requirements.&quot;</P><H3>'They Can't Ignore Investors'</H3><P>This year's shareholder resolutions addressing global warming go well beyond fossil fuel companies, cutting across a broad spectrum of businesses that include Apple Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., Lowe's Companies Inc., JP Morgan Chase and Company, and Ford Motor Company.</P><P>Investors will be paying attention to how much companies drag their feet on <mark>climate</mark> issues, Fugere said.</P><P>&quot;These are sophisticated shareholders who have an interest in a <mark>sustainable</mark> world and investments in companies with stable business models that will protect their investments—and understand that they are related,&quot; she said.</P><P>Natasha Lamb, an executive with Arjuna Capital, which has filed several resolutions on behalf of shareholders in recent years, said investors increasingly recognize the risks. &quot;Now that the broader investment community has taken notice, it's time for companies to accept,&quot; she said.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""tagged-with""><LABEL>Published Under:</LABEL></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The cities claim these companies are responsible for <mark>climate change</mark>, and are demanding compensation for environmental damage caused by their products.</P><P>The suits, filed separately in Alameda and San Francisco counties on September 19, say Chevron, which operates a refinery in Richmond, and four other defendants—BP, the ConocoPhillips Company, the Exxon Mobil Corporation, and Royal Dutch Shell—not only produce the bulk of the fossil fuels responsible for <mark>climate change</mark>, but also that the companies know their products cause “catastrophic” and “severe” impacts on the global <mark>climate</mark>. The cities accused the companies of creating a public nuisance.</P><P>Each lawsuit seeks a court order requiring the five oil and gas companies to pay into an abatement fund, which would help finance the building of sea walls and other infrastructure needed to deal with rising water levels in the Bay Area.</P><P>Although the suits do not ask for a specific dollar amount, San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera estimated the damage to public and private property from bigger storm surges and higher tides could be more than $40 billion.</P><P>A <A href=""http://www.opc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/docs/rising-seas-in-california-an-update-on-sea-level-rise-science.pdf"">report</A> published in April by the state’s California Ocean Protection Council Science Advisory Team projects .3 to .8 feet of sea-level rise by 2030 if fossil-fuel use goes unchecked. By 2100, sea level along San Francisco’s coast could rise up to 10 feet.</P><P>“As a city surrounded by water on three sides, San Francisco would be devastated by this increase,” Herrera said during a <A href=""https://www.sfcityattorney.org/2017/09/19/san-francisco-oakland-sue-top-five-oil-gas-companies-costs-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">press conference</A> to announce the suits.</P><P>In Oakland, sea level rise of that degree would threaten to put large parts of the city’s flatlands, including Jack London Square and the airport, under water, City Attorney Barbara Parker said during the press conference.</P><P>“It is past time to question the reality of global warming,” Parker said. “We are bearing witness every day as we are shocked and, in fact, traumatized, by catastrophe after catastrophe.”</P><P>The five companies are also accused of funding a million-dollar campaign to mislead the public about global warming. This effort, the suit reads, bears “a striking resemblance to Big Tobacco’s propaganda campaign to deceive the public about the adverse health effects of smoking.”</P><P>The suits cite a 2015 report published by <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/15092015/Exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming"">Inside <mark>Climate</mark> News</A> that revealed Exxon’s own scientific researchers confirmed fossil fuels’ role in <mark>climate change</mark> four decades ago, well before most of the world had heard of the looming environmental crisis.</P><P>It’s not clear whether the four additional companies named as defendants had similar in-house knowledge. But the suits cite a 1968 report by the American Petroleum Institute (API), a trade association that represents the country’s oil and gas industry, that warned members <mark>carbon</mark>-dioxide emissions could cause “major changes in the earth’s environment” and a “rise in sea levels.”</P><P>“There seems to be no doubt that the potential damage to our environment could be severe,” the API report concluded.</P><P>Yet, each defendant decided to continue its conduct and commit itself to massive fossil fuel production, the suits read.</P><P>“This was a deliberate decision to place company profits ahead of human safety and well-being and property, and to foist onto the public the costs of abating and adapting to the public nuisance of global warming,” the suits read.</P><P>Spokespersons for Chevron and Shell would not discuss specifics of the lawsuits, but said the cities’ efforts were not constructive.</P><P>“Chevron welcomes serious attempts to address the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>, but these suits do not do that,” Chevron spokeswoman Melissa Ritchie wrote in an email.</P><P>“We strongly support the agreement in Paris to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius or less,” Ray Fisher, a spokesperson for Shell, wrote in an email, “but we believe <mark>climate change</mark> is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change … not by the courts.”</P><P>Daren Beaudo, a spokesman for ConocoPhillips, declined to comment, and representatives from BP and Exxon could not be reached.</P><P>The Bay Area suits are the latest efforts to hold fossil-fuel companies accountable for damages wrought by rising seas. In July, <A href=""http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Marin-San-Mateo-County-sue-big-oil-over-<mark>climate</mark>-11294549.php"">Marin and San Mateo counties</A>, along with the city of Imperial Beach in San Diego County, filed similar lawsuits against 37 oil and coal companies, including Chevron, ExxonMobil, BP and Shell.</P><P>Most attempts to litigate against oil and gas companies have been unsuccessful. In 2008, the Alaskan village of Kivalina, which needs to be relocated because of flooding, sued five oil companies, one coal company and 14 electric utilities. The case failed, though, when a district court <A href=""http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2012/09/25/09-17490.pdf"">ruled</A> it was politically motivated and did not belong in the courts. Another, brought by California against <A href=""http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/cms06/06-082_0a.pdf"">six automakers</A>, had a similar outcome.</P><P>Herrera and Parker said their lawsuits’ simplicity makes them different.</P><P>“Clearly, it is right and just that these defendants be liable for these costs,” Parker said. “When you know your product will create a public nuisance, in this case a product with potentially disastrous and catastrophic consequences, and when you continue to market that product and promote that product as safe, you are liable, period.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The defendants — BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, and ConocoPhillips — sent one lawyer, from Chevron. And when it was his turn to present, the Chevron attorney agreed that human activity is changing the <mark>climate</mark> and that it warrants action.</P><P id=""lvwhiV"">This is a seismic shift from years past, when “<A href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/publications/catalyst/su15-documenting-fossil-fuel-companies-<mark>climate</mark>-deception"">uncertainties</A>” about <mark>climate change</mark> were the party line for oil companies. Humanity’s role in rising temperatures has now been established in court, and future legal wrangling will have to build on this foundation. </P><P id=""XwYDWm"">But the agreement to the fundamental mechanisms behind <mark>climate change</mark> now will give way to the thornier legal debate of establishing blame.</P><P id=""3b33Im"">The suits are part of a suite of litigation filed by nine American cities against big oil to pay for current and future damages to some of the most expensive real estate in the country caused by rising seas and hotter weather. </P><P id=""T366ja"">The cities are arguing that oil companies promoted the use of fossil fuels while denying or downplaying their harmful effects, and so should help cities pay for infrastructure like coastal barriers to protect them. </P><P id=""3SDCAk"">But the judge presiding over the suits, William Alsup, wanted to get the science straight first, and he invited the cities and the oil companies to present the history of <mark>climate change</mark> research and the best available findings in a kind of unusual hearing that he’s become <A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber"">known</A> for.

And what we learned from the tutorial is that these companies are likely to use the agreed-upon science to make the case that they shouldn’t have to pay for the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P id=""JNGS92"">If the cities’ lawsuit survives a barrage of motions to dismiss, they will still have to show that oil majors deliberately sowed confusion on <mark>climate change</mark> in bad faith.Let’s walk through what we know about the various arguments so far. </P><H3 id=""9FFvBv"">Oil companies agree on the science but not the politics</H3><P id=""AWIkgM"">The fundamental argument from the oil companies is that <mark>climate change</mark> is a global problem that needs a political solution, and you can’t solve a political problem in court and you certainly can’t blame the oil companies for selling a product that everyone wants to buy. </P><P id=""BDk4p1"">Theodore Boutrous, a <A href=""https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/boutrous-jr-theodore-j/"">seasoned litigator</A> who’s argued cases before the US Supreme Court, presented on behalf of Chevron. “Chevron accepts the consensus in the scientific communities on <mark>climate change</mark>,” he said last week. “There’s no debate about <mark>climate</mark> science.”</P><P id=""hZydq0"">He built his presentation around the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>’s <A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/"">fifth assessment report</A>, published in 2013, which has more than 800 authors and cites more than 9,200 scientific papers (he also rewatched <A href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/""><EM>An Inconvenient Truth</EM></A>). The report states that the IPCC is “95 percent certain that humans are the main cause of current global warming” and remains one of the most robust works in <mark>climate</mark> science. </P><P id=""VqGdix"">But as Boutrous detailed the history of how <mark>climate</mark> scientists like Svante Arrhenius and John Tyndall developed their theories, he also noted that previous IPCC reports weren’t always so certain. The 1990 report said that “the observed increase could be largely due to natural variability.” The 1995 report said that signals were emerging that there is human influence on the <mark>climate</mark>. The 2001 report said that warming was “very unlikely” due to natural causes alone. </P><P id=""biLlp4"">The point he was making was that the consensus took time to build, and as the science got better, Chevron moved with it. Past rhetoric from oil companies reflected this uncertainty in the science, and Chevron now has a <A href=""https://www.chevron.com/corporate-responsibility/<mark>climate</mark>-change"">comprehensive strategy</A> for managing <mark>climate</mark> risks, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions. </P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>Chevron’s El Segundo Refinery covers approximately 1,000 acres with more than 1,100 miles of pipelines and is capable of refining nearly 270,000 barrels of crude oil per day.</FIGCAPTION><CITE>David McNew/Getty Images</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""H1Zi51"">Another key point Boutrous made was that these human-sourced greenhouse gas emissions are due to growing wealth and development, of which fossil fuel combustion is a symptom, not a cause. “Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever,” the IPCC reported in <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/news_and_events/docs/ar5/ar5_syr_headlines_en.pdf"">2014</A>. </P><P id=""X2JhZ3"">“It’s just a facet of human existence,” Boutrous told Vox. “It’s an issue for policymakers to address.”</P><P id=""Hx9n7I"">And looking toward the future, it’s unclear how <mark>climate change</mark> will impact San Francisco and Oakland in particular. San Francisco, in its complaint, included a map showing water inundation for the city with 66 inches of sea level rise plus 42 inches of flooding from a <A href=""https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/28/16211392/100-500-year-flood-meaning"">100-year storm</A>, a scenario they called “unlikely, but possible.”</P><P id=""XkjoUu"">Boutrous pointed out that while global sea levels are rising on average, some evidence shows that sea levels have fallen in specific regions, and coastal flooding in places like the San Francisco Bay Area is also a function of local conditions like <A href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180307141411.htm"">land subsidence</A>. </P><P id=""6ChfQj"">So for San Francisco and Oakland to build a claim on harms from future sea level rise is a stretch when there is so much uncertainty as to what will happen, the argument goes.</P><P id=""ke9AHk"">Boutrous noted that when the judge asked the scientists in the room if they disagreed with what he presented, they didn’t question his reading of the facts. </P><P id=""JqqmAq"">That signals that progress in these lawsuits isn’t going to hinge on the science so much as an untested legal theory, and that’s where the plaintiffs are on weak footing, according to Boutrous. Holding oil companies liable for producing fossil fuels would also open up cities to liability for building roads and facilitating travel with vehicles that burn those fuels. </P><P id=""0SeikJ"">“Focusing resources on a novel, never-accepted theory just isn’t the way to have a productive chance at really addressing global warming,” Boutrous said. “No tort theory has ever been developed that comes close to covering these issues.” </P><H3 id=""1FjVuh"">The <mark>climate</mark> models have gotten better; the news has gotten worse </H3><P id=""x1ezhd"">But Donald Wuebbles, an author of the 2013 IPCC report as well as the 2017 <A href=""https://science2017.globalchange.gov/"">National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment</A> produced by 13 US federal agencies, noted that while the last IPCC report may be the biggest work in <mark>climate</mark> science, it only incorporated research published as of 2012. </P><P id=""FQVBDN"">“I started up my talk saying that the science didn’t stop in 2012,” Wuebbles, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois, told Vox. “The reality is these assessments are very conservative in their statements.”</P><P id=""bLVr1X"">His end of the tutorial focused on the changes we can anticipate as average temperatures go up around the world, noting that models have become more robust and that scientists are zeroing in on the harms that will be caused by unmitigated changes to the global <mark>climate</mark>. Judge Alsup also asked him about policy questions like which energy sources the United States can use if it gives up coal, oil, and natural gas.</P><P id=""RZz3ub"">The other four defendants had representatives in the room but declined to present, which San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera read as a signal that the other oil companies did not even want to recognize that the court has jurisdiction in such a case. </P><P id=""WstLvp"">But Alsup didn’t let the other oil companies off the hook, as Debra Kahn of <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/2018/03/22/stories/1060077139"">E&amp;E News</A> noted:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P id=""ak4Jix"">Alsup ordered the other defendants in the suit — BP PLC, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, all of which had representatives at the hearing — to submit briefs within two weeks detailing any points of disagreement with Chevron. “Otherwise, I’m going to assume you’re in agreement,” he said. “You can’t get away with sitting there in silence and then later say, ‘He wasn’t speaking for us.’”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P id=""BtoyKV"">For its part, San Francisco counted the tutorial as a win.</P><P id=""ZOYPmx"">“What we saw today was one oil company begrudgingly accept the scientific consensus while trying to overemphasize the extent of scientific uncertainty,” Herrera said in a statement. “It’s time for them to pay for the seawalls and other infrastructure needed to protect San Francisco and Oakland.”</P><P id=""57ak9s"">The legal maneuvering in this case will continue, and the litigation will likely take <A href=""https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Should-oil-companies-pay-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change-Yes-12768553.php"">years</A> to resolve. Yet the fact that the lawsuits were allowed to proceed this far and that the judge has cemented the science in the courtroom means that the foundation for <mark>climate change</mark> litigation is the strongest it’s ever been. The question for the court is whether it’s strong enough to bill an oil company for a levee.</P><P id=""UOaJ2N"">UCLA’s Carlson said that the defendants will continue to file motions to dismiss the case citing different arguments — that the court doesn’t have jurisdiction in such a case, for instance, or that the defendants don’t have standing, or that federal law doesn’t provide any recourse in such a lawsuit. If none of those motions finds traction in the court, then four to six months from now, the cases move to the discovery phase, where the defendants will have to start producing documents and providing evidence. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In a California courtroom on Wednesday, Chevron’s attorneys didn’t dispute the science that suggested humans, and by extension oil companies, were at least contributing to adverse <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Chevron stock holders need not hit the panic button just yet. Chevron didn’t exactly admit guilt as it pertains to its role in <mark>climate change</mark>. And, the legal argument being levied against “Big Oil” in this particular case is a bit confusing in its goal. Every little bit helps, or hurts, though, depending on which side of the table you’re sitting on.</P><H3>It’s Complicated</H3><P>The pre-trial hearing, which took place in San Francisco, didn’t determine innocence or guilt. The hearing was simply an unconventional way for litigants to decide which weapons would be allowed to be wielded in an upcoming legal battle between the five most prominent oil names and the coastal cities of San Francisco and Oakland.</P><P>They’re suing the five Big Oil icons not to stop spewing <mark>CO2</mark> into the earth’s atmosphere, but rather, to demand these energy companies <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-<mark>climate</mark>change-hearing/chevron-says-it-will-not-dispute-<mark>climate</mark>-science-in-u-s-lawsuit-idUSKBN1GX185"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">help fund the construction of a wall</A> that will keep rising ocean waters from creeping into their cities.</P><P>Chevron’s lawyers, along with attorneys representing the other top four oil names, are asking for a dismissal of the pending case. In the meantime though, none of them are denying that the plaintiff’s evidence of global warming is untrue.</P><P>The defendants are, however, still going to argue they can’t be held liable for the outcome of higher global temperatures. They all agree that only Congress (via the EPA) has jurisdiction over the fossil fuel emissions.	</P><P>The defendants added for good measure that they only provided what was being used by consumers, and that unchecked population growth exacerbated the issue.</P><H3>The Case for Chevron Stock</H3><P>It’s not a bad legal argument, truth be told. As Chevron’s written request for a dismissal <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chevron-will-stick-to-ipcc-findings-in-landmark-<mark>climate</mark>-change-trial/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">noted</A>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“This is not the first (or even the second or third) time a plaintiff has tried to plead global warming-related tort claims. Similar claims have been considered, and dismissed, by the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit, and district courts around the country.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Also weakening the plaintiff’s case is the nature of the suit itself.</P><P>It’s being filed as a nuisance suit, which generally call for the closure of a business or the removal of an annoying eyesore or noise. Not this nuisance suit though. This one is gunning for money. Richard Faulk, public-nuisance experts and counsel with Davis Wright Tremaine, commented on the matter “what we have here is a typical tort lawsuit for damages.”</P><P>The plaintiff’s attorneys aren’t exactly shooting blanks though. Along with Big Oil’s concession that <mark>climate change</mark> is real, even if their role in it has not yet been determined, the suit also claims that the likes of Exxon Mobil, BP and Chevron all funded <mark>climate change</mark> research that was ultimately intended to mislead the public about fossil fuel’s role in damage to the environment.</P><P>As San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said it, “These companies knew their products were causing sea-level rise, and they deceived people about it. Now, that bill has come due.”</P><H3>Bottom Line for Chevron Stock</H3><P>From a pure letter of the law perspective, owners of Chevron stock don’t have a great deal to worry about. At worst it would share a modest amount of liability with the rest of the oil industry, as sole causation has yet to be pegged to oil companies. And, even if it is determined, this really is an EPA matter.</P><P>The deception claims (suggesting that Big Oil paid to deceive… everyone) haven’t worked in other similar cases.</P><P>On the flipside, U.S. courtrooms are increasingly moving away from ruling based on the strictest letter of the law, and <A href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2010/08/in_defense_of_the_new_judicial_activists.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">instead making decisions grounded in a sense of fairness</A>. On the wrong day at the wrong time with a judge and jury in the wrong mood, this could end up being a blow to Big Oil.</P><P>The real risk to Chevron stock, however, goes beyond this one case. By forcing oil companies to take the small step of acknowledging that <mark>climate change</mark> science is valid now, the next step to energy companies conceding fossil fuels are a leading cause of <mark>climate change</mark> is a small one.</P><P>The <mark>climate</mark> activists’ war won’t be won with a decisive victory, but dozens and dozens of successful, progressive skirmishes.</P><P><EM>As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The plaintiffs alleged that Peabody (and a number of other fossil fuel companies) caused greenhouse gas emissions that resulted in sea level rise and damage to their property. Peabody,  a coal company, filed for bankruptcy in April 2016 and emerged from bankruptcy under a plan that became effective on April 3, 2017. As an initial matter, the bankruptcy court said the plaintiffs had not established any basis for a claim because the complaints’ only Peabody-specific allegations were that Peabody had exported coal from terminals or ports in several California counties and was a member of organizations that plaintiffs said denied <mark>climate change</mark>. The court further concluded, however, that even assuming claims did exist, the claims were pre-bankruptcy petition claims that had been discharged under the bankruptcy plan because the plaintiffs had not filed proofs of claim. The court determined, moreover, that even if the plaintiffs’ claims could be construed as post-effective date claims (i.e., claims concerning conduct and harm after Peabody emerged from bankruptcy), the claims did not fall within the scope of a settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other governmental entities to allow continued enforcement of environmental laws related to ongoing mining operations. The bankruptcy court also rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that one of their nuisance claims did not constitute a “Claim” or “Liability” pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code and Peabody’s bankruptcy plan and therefore could not be discharged and enjoined.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>09/26/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20170926_docket-16-42529-399_opposition.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Objection filed to Peabody motion.</TD><TD><STRONG>California Counties and City Argued for Keeping Peabody in <mark>Climate</mark> Case.</STRONG> San Mateo and Marin Counties and the City of Imperial Beach (the plaintiffs) opposed Peabody Energy Corporation’s (Peabody) motion in federal bankruptcy court in Missouri to enjoin them from pursuing their public nuisance and tort law claims against Peabody.

Peabody argued that the discharge and injunction contained in its plan for reorganization barred the claims. The plaintiffs argued that multiple carve-outs in the injunction allowed them to proceed with their claims against Peabody. They contended that they were governmental plaintiffs exercising their police powers, that their statutory public nuisance cause of action did not constitute a “claim” subject to the injunction, and that their claims fell within a carve-out for governmental claims brought under “Environmental Law.”</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>08/28/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20170828_docket-16-42529-399_motion.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Motion filed by Peabody Energy Corporation for entry of order enforcing the discharge and injunction set forth in the confirmation order and plan.</TD><TD><STRONG>Peabody Energy Sought Dismissal of California County and City Lawsuits Against Fossil Fuel Companies.</STRONG> On August 28, 2017, Peabody Energy Corporation (Peabody) asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri to order San Mateo County, Marin County, and the City of Imperial Beach to dismiss complaints against Peabody filed in California Superior Court in July 2017.

The unusual hearing was required by Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing lawsuits filed by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland claiming that five oil giants are contributing to damages related to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>In the hours before the tutorial, which Alsup is using to gather historical observations about climatic conditions that can go back thousands of years, Chevron said it wouldn’t question the facts around rising temperatures.</P><P>“Chevron is not going to be engaging in a debate on <mark>climate change</mark> science,” said Avi Garbow, co-chairman of the Environmental Litigation and Mass Tort Practice Group at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP and a Chevron lawyer. He’s also a former official in the Obama administration who defended the Clean Power Plan as general counsel to then-U.S. EPA chief Gina McCarthy.</P><P>The company will “anchor its presentation” on the Fifth Assessment Report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC), issued in 2014, he said on a call with reporters Monday.</P><P>“Chevron’s neither going to overstate nor understate degrees of confidence. Chevron’s simply going to present the conclusions of the IPCC because Chevron thinks that’s the best and the most accurate way of responding to the court’s tutorial request,” Garbow said.</P><P>San Francisco and Oakland, along with several counties in California, are suing Chevron, BP PLC, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC for allegedly downplaying the threat of <mark>climate change</mark>. The local governments claim that the oil majors knew years ago that the emissions related to their products could cause sea-level rise and contribute to other damages.</P><P>Earlier this month, Alsup asked the cities and oil companies to answer nine questions, including “What are the main sources of <mark>CO2</mark> that account for the incremental buildup of <mark>CO2</mark> in the atmosphere?” and “What are the main sources of heat that account for the incremental rise in temperature on Earth?”</P><P>He also asked the cities to produce documents referred to in their suits that deal with the extent to which the oil companies knew about the risks of <mark>climate change</mark>. Those documents have been submitted to the court.</P><P>Despite its open approach to the science hearing, Chevron yesterday filed a <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/assets/2018/03/20/document_gw_20.pdf"">motion</A> to dismiss the suits. So did ConocoPhillips, which claimed that the cases lack jurisdiction because it’s a Delaware company headquartered in Houston.</P><P>Chevron said claims that are similar to those filed by San Francisco and Oakland have been dismissed by other courts. Its key argument is that U.S. EPA has oversight over greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>“This is not the first (or even the second or third) time a plaintiff has tried to plead global warming-related tort claims,” Chevron’s motion said. “Similar claims have been considered, and dismissed, by the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit, and district courts around the country.”</P><P>Oil companies beyond Chevron declined to say if they would make presentations at today’s hearing or defer to Chevron. A spokesman for Exxon Mobil criticized the lawsuits.</P><P>“Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions,” Scott Silvestri said in an email. “Lawsuits of this kind—filed by trial attorneys against an industry that provides products we all rely upon to power the economy and enable our domestic life—simply do not do that.”</P><P>The cities’ attorneys declined to reveal their strategies for the hearing. San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said he “looks forward to providing the objective history of <mark>climate change</mark> science and the consensus science on future impacts. It’s time for <mark>climate</mark> science to have its day in court.”</P><P>“These companies knew their products were causing sea-level rise, and they deceived people about it,” Herrera added. “Now, that bill has come due.”</P><H2>On the record</H2><P>The oil companies have no real choice but to acknowledge <mark>climate</mark> science, legal experts said.</P><P>“They realize that the science behind <mark>climate change</mark> is so well understood and accepted that it isn’t in their interest to be seen as deniers,” Ann Carlson, co-director of the Emmett Institute on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the Environment, said in an email. “Moreover, their own internal documents and research accept the validity of <mark>climate change</mark> and for several of them they’ve made public statements acknowledging the human contribution to <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>She added, “They’re really hedging their bets, instead, on the large number of contributors to <mark>climate change</mark>, the causation questions, the global nature of the problem, and the hope that they can get courts to find that federal common law (at least) displaces nuisance claims.”</P><P>On the call with reporters, Chevron attorneys said it’s not possible to pin the cause of warming on a handful of oil companies. The cities in their suits say that the consumption of fossil fuels has created harms, said Joshua Lipshutz, a partner at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher and a Chevron lawyer.</P><P>“If that’s the allegation, then really anyone in the world could be brought in in the case, including the plaintiffs themselves,” he said. “San Francisco and Oakland are large consumers of fossil fuels and large emitters of greenhouse gas emissions.”</P><P>The Chevron lawyers discounted research attempting to pinpoint sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Garbow said it’s not emphasized in the IPCC report, which is considered scientific consensus.</P><P>“It is, as far as I’m aware, a line of, if you will, scientific study or inquiry that is not very developed, and certainly not at this juncture widely accepted by any stretch,” Garbow said.</P><P>Daniel Farber, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an email that the oil companies may try to show that there was “more uncertainty until recently” in terms of <mark>climate</mark> science.</P><P>Garbow, the Chevron lawyer, noted “that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-20th century.”</P><P>Farber said showing that uncertainty existed years ago might help the companies fight accusations that they knew the risks and “were simply lying in their public statements or were completely irresponsible to oppose regulation at earlier points in time—whether it helps them enough isn’t clear to me.”</P><P>Farber said it’s noteworthy that the oil companies plan to acknowledge that <mark>climate</mark> science is accurate.</P><P>“Most or all of the major oil corporations have now acknowledged the reality of <mark>climate change</mark> and the need for government action (though who knows how serious they are about that),” he said. “So it would be hard for them to take a contrary view in this litigation. Getting them to say the same thing in court will be kind of a victory for the plaintiffs even if nothing else goes their way.”</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>wire with permission from E&amp;E News.

However, Boutrous also said earlier IPCC reports were not as certain. </P><P>The judge asked Boutrous if the other four companies agreed with his presentation, and Boutrous said he was only speaking for Chevron.  </P><P>No attorneys for the other four companies answered questions at the hearing, though all generally acknowledge the reality of <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>“I’m going to ask them at some point if they agree with everything you said,” Alsup said. </P><P>All five companies argued in court papers on Tuesday that they should not be held liable for warming, which is caused by “billions” of parties and “complex environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades.”</P><DIV class=""container_28wm1""><DIV class=""attribution_o4ojT""><P class=""content_27_rw"">Reporting by Dan Levine; editing by Grant McCool</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The Chevron complaint cites Statoil’s production numbers, including approximately 251,000 barrels of oil per day just in its U.S. business. Statoil did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Chevron argues that since Statoil also produces and sells large amounts of petroleum, it should be held to the same standard of liability in these lawsuits. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Basically, when you have multiple parties potentially liable for damages and not all of them have been named in the lawsuit defendants can and will file these types of third party complaints against others,” said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Law at Columbia University. “ It is one way of attempting to bring them into the case.”</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Indeed, Chevron indicates in its filing that its attempt to shift the blame goes beyond Statoil, stating, “this third-party complaint is one of many that Chevron expects to file should this case proceed past motions to dismiss.” </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ann Carlson, environmental law professor and co-direct of the Emmett Institute on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the Environment at UCLA School of Law, said Chevron appears to be appealing to the global nature of <mark>climate change</mark> in trying to implicate other fossil producers. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I don’t view the move as demonstrating a fear of actual liability so much as a strategic move to paint a more complicated picture about global contributors to <mark>climate change</mark>,” she said. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Such legal maneuverings are expected in a complex liability case.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I expect there is already wrangling over insurance coverage and other related issues as well,” said Sean Hecht, professor of policy and practice and co-executive director of the Emmett Institute at UCLA. “It’s normal to see concerns about indemnification arise early in a case of this complexity and scope, regardless of a defendant’s view of its ultimate litigation risk.”</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Norway is viewed as a <mark>climate</mark> leader and impressively green,” Carlson added. “But much of its wealth comes, of course, from oil production in the North Sea, and is a key part of its generous welfare state. Bringing Statoil in as a defendant is meant to show that the good guys are also responsible for a significant percentage of global emissions.”</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Attribution science, however, shows that Chevron bears more responsibility for historical emissions than Statoil. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">A </SPAN><A href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-013-0986-y""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">study</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> by Richard Heede in 2013 identified 90 companies responsible for nearly two-thirds of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions since the Industrial Revolution. These “<mark>carbon</mark> majors” include investor-owned corporations, state-owned companies, and government-run operations in countries like China and the former Soviet Union. For state-owned and investor-owned companies, Chevron tops the list. According to Heede’s research, it contributed 3.52 percent of global emissions from 1751-2010. Statoil is a <mark>carbon</mark> major but it doesn’t make the top 20, with its calculated share of emissions at 0.30 percent. The top five in Heede’s study are Chevron, ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, BP and Gazprom. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">“It’s up to the courts to apportion liability, not Chevron. Chevron’s attempt to draw in another oil company is a tactic to shield itself from liability,” said Kristin Casper, Greenpeace Canada’s litigation counsel for the global <mark>climate</mark> justice and liability campaign. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">“The move is just another fancy way of muddying the water by repeating the tired industry mantra that ‘everyone is responsible for <mark>climate change</mark>, so no one can be held accountable, especially not us,’” she added. “Chevron is trying to intimidate the court and delay the legal actions from going forward with this cynical tactic. It’s time to talk about the insane profits the oil industry and executives have made for decades while misleading the public about the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> and leaving cities to foot the bill for adapting to the <mark>climate</mark> crisis.” </SPAN></P><P> </P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Rather, he said, humanity's larger economic decisions are to blame.</P><SECTION class=""ad medium""><P class=""label"">Advertisement</P></SECTION><P>&quot;The IPCC does not say it's the extraction and production of oil that is driving these emissions,&quot; he said. &quot;It's economic activity that creates the demand for energy, and that leads to emissions.&quot;</P><P>The unusual five-hour hearing was required by Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, who is overseeing the cities' lawsuits seeking damages related to sea-level rise and other effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Earlier this month, Alsup asked the cities and oil companies to answer nine questions, including &quot;What are the main sources of <mark>CO2</mark> that account for the incremental buildup of <mark>CO2</mark> in the atmosphere?&quot; and &quot;What are the main sources of heat that account for the incremental rise in temperature on Earth?&quot;</P><P>In answering those questions, Boutrous hewed to the Fifth Assessment Report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC), issued in 2014. His presentation and the cities' presentation overlapped significantly, acknowledging the historic contributions of scientists including Joseph Fourier, John Tyndall, Svante Arrhenius, Gilbert Plass and Roger Revelle.</P><P>But where Boutrous relied nearly exclusively on the U.N. report, which draws on science from 2012 and earlier, the plaintiffs cited more-recent and more-specific findings, like the National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment and the state of California's Ocean Protection Council <A href=""http://www.opc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/docs/rising-seas-in-california-an-update-on-sea-level-rise-science.pdf"">guidance</A> on sea-level rise, both released last year.</P><P>Under active questioning from Alsup, Oxford University physicist Myles Allen explained the details of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide's role in preventing infrared radiation from leaving the atmosphere, how various parts of the Earth absorb the molecules, and how the greenhouse effect works on other planets. He only got through about one-third of his material before he had exhausted his allotted hour.</P><P>&quot;I didn't know that U.S. courts did this kind of thing,&quot; he said in an interview afterward. &quot;I think it's great.&quot;</P><P>Another scientist called by the plaintiffs, Gary Griggs, an oceanographer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who led the state report on sea-level rise, said that sea levels have been rising an average of 1.1 millimeters annually and warned of the possibility that polar ice sheets could melt and cause catastrophic rises.</P><P>Boutrous used the IPCC data to point to decreases in sea surface height off the West Coast from 1993 to 2012 and highlight the uncertainties of future projections of sea-level rise. &quot;Even his own study is saying there's a 0.1 percent chance&quot; of a 10-foot sea-level rise off San Francisco by 2100, he said of Griggs' research.</P><P>Alsup asked the plaintiffs where they differed from Chevron's positions.</P><P>&quot;They do agree that humans are putting <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into the air, that does in fact cause warming, that does in fact cause sea-level rise,&quot; Alsup said. &quot;What critique would you make of what I just heard from the other side? They seem to be largely agreeing.&quot;</P><P>&quot;That's not what you see at all in the media, and that's why these points are emphasized,&quot; said Don Wuebbles, a University of Illinois atmospheric scientist who led a special science report for the most recent National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment and was assistant director at the Office of Science and Technology Policy under former President Obama. Wuebbles pointed out that over the past century, sea levels off San Francisco have risen 7.7 inches, according to tide gauges.</P><P>&quot;If you look at the time period since 2012, you actually go back to seeing an increase in the region,&quot; he said. &quot;That is a little different than the picture he [Boutrous] was trying to paint in his presentation. Again, the science does not stop in 2012.&quot;</P><P>The San Francisco and Oakland cases are among numerous lawsuits from California municipalities against oil companies for <mark>climate</mark> damages. Federal court Judge Vince Chhabria — located in the same building as Alsup — last week ruled that lawsuits from Imperial Beach, San Mateo and Marin County should not have been moved to federal court and sent them back to state court. He said that federal common law does not govern their claims. He's also handling suits from Richmond, Santa Cruz and Santa Cruz County but hasn't ruled yet on whether those should go back to state court. Chevron and ConocoPhillips are appealing Chhabria's decision.</P><P>&quot;As the defendants note, these state law claims raise national and perhaps global questions,&quot; Chhabria said in the order affecting Imperial Beach, San Mateo and Marin County. &quot;It may even be that these local actions are federally preempted. But to justify removal from state court to federal court, a defendant must be able to show that the case being removed fits within one of a small handful of small boxes. Because these lawsuits do not fit within any of those boxes, they were properly filed in state court and improperly removed to federal court.&quot;</P><P>Alsup ordered the other defendants in the suit — BP PLC, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, all of which had representatives at the hearing — to submit briefs within two weeks detailing any points of disagreement with Chevron. &quot;Otherwise, I'm going to assume you're in agreement,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't get away with sitting there in silence and then later say, 'He wasn't speaking for us.'&quot;</P><P>Plaintiffs criticized Chevron and the other companies' approach.</P><P>&quot;What we saw today was one oil company begrudgingly accept the scientific consensus while trying to overemphasize the extent of scientific uncertainty,&quot; San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement. &quot;The other four major oil companies refused to even participate or recognize the court has jurisdiction over them. Apparently they think they're above the law.&quot;</P><P>Other observers said that it was notable that Chevron acknowledged mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science, but that it could be years before the case is resolved. The companies have all filed motions to dismiss both suits; presuming the suits continue, both courts would need to reach decisions before an appeal could be heard.</P><P>&quot;The sea-rise evidence and the sea-rise data is so much stronger than it was six years ago that they can kind of use the IPCC as a conservative approach, whereas the plaintiffs are taking the current, state-of-the-art approach,&quot; said Bill Rossbach, a trial lawyer consulting for the Center for <mark>Climate</mark> Integrity.</P><P>&quot;I'm sure they have other bases for thinking that they are not liable, and those are all going to be put forth in legal arguments to have the court throw the case out,&quot; he said. &quot;There's a long way from here to them writing a check.&quot;</P><P><EM>Reporter Anne C.

In the proxy statement, the company’s Board attempts to convince shareholders that Chevron’s political activities—which include support for groups that spread <mark>climate</mark> disinformation—are in shareholders’ long-term interests.</P><P>Pressure continues to mount on major fossil fuel companies like Chevron to renounce disinformation on <mark>climate</mark> science and policy and begin to plan for a world free from <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>. Here’s a preview of some of the key <mark>climate</mark>-related issues on the agenda at Chevron’s annual meeting on May 31 in Midland, Texas.</P><H3>Systemic economic risks</H3><P>There is substantial backing in the business and investor communities for strengthening and harmonizing <mark>climate</mark>-related financial disclosures by companies in all sectors. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. Recognizing the potential systemic risks posed by <mark>climate change</mark> to the global economy and economic system, the FSB set up a Task Force on <mark>Climate</mark>-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) chaired by former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.</P><P>In December 2016, the TCFD released its <A href=""https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/publications/recommendations-report/"" target=""_blank"">Recommendations Report</A>. The TCFD recommended disclosure of <mark>climate</mark>-related financial risks in mainstream (i.e., public) financial filings. Specifically, the TCFD recommended that companies disclose what a 2° Celsius scenario would mean for their businesses, strategies, and financial planning.</P><P>The Union of Concerned Scientists and other stakeholders have provided comments on the TCFD’s Recommendations Report, which is expected to be taken up by the leaders of G20 countries this year.</P><P>Now is a good time to consider how Chevron’s 2017 financial filings measure up to these mainstream recommendations and expectations.</P><H3>2°C scenario planning</H3><P>Increasingly, shareowners of major fossil energy companies are <A href=""http://blog.ucsusa.org/kathy-mulvey/chevron-exxonmobil-shareholder-meetings"" target=""_blank"">calling for </A>annual reporting on how <mark>climate</mark> policies may affect their business in light of the globally agreed target to limit global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. This year, Chevron shareholders have put forward a resolution calling for annual planning on <A href=""https://www.ceres.org/investor-network/resolutions/publish-annual-assessment-of-2-degree-scenario-2017"" target=""_blank"">2°C scenarios</A>, along with a proposal on <A href=""https://www.ceres.org/investor-network/resolutions/report-on-transition-to-low-<mark>carbon</mark>-economy-2017"" target=""_blank"">transition to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy</A>. In 2016, the 2°C scenario planning <A href=""https://www.ceres.org/investor-network/resolutions/chevron-ghg-goals-2016-1"" target=""_blank"">resolution</A> won the support of more than 40% of Chevron shareholders.</P><P>In our inaugural <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/<mark>climate</mark>scorecard"" target=""_blank""><EM><mark>Climate</mark> Accountability Scorecard</EM></A> released last October, UCS assessed how <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2016/10/<mark>climate</mark>-accountability-scorecard-chevron-fact-sheet.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Chevron</A> is planning for a world free from <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>—and scored the company “poor.” We recommended that Chevron:</P><UL><LI>Publicly acknowledge the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement’s long-term goal and its implications for the swift transition to global net-zero emissions;</LI><LI>Disclose emissions resulting from the company’s operations and the use of its products;</LI><LI>Set and disclose initial near-term company-wide targets to reduce emissions from its operations and the use of its products;</LI><LI>Develop and publicly communicate a clear plan and timeline to deepen emissions reductions consistent with the Paris agreement’s long-term goal.</LI></UL><P>In the 2017 proxy statement, Chevron’s board recommends a “no” vote on both the 2°C scenario planning and transition to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy proposals. The Board asserts that Chevron’s report “<A href=""https://www.chevron.com/-/media/chevron/shared/documents/<mark>climate</mark>-risk-perspective.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Managing <mark>Climate Change</mark> Risks: A Perspective for Investors</A>,” released last month, substantially addresses the issues raised by its shareowners in these resolutions, despite a lack of such disclosures in the company’s U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting.</P><P>This report comes to some extraordinary conclusions, including:</P><UL><LI>“…Chevron’s current risk management and business planning processes are sufficient to mitigate the risks associated with <mark>climate change</mark>.”</LI><LI>“…the current risk exposure to the Company even in a restricted GHG [greenhouse gas] scenario is minimal.”</LI></UL><P>Yet “Managing <mark>Climate Change</mark> Risks” is not a robust analysis of the potential business, strategic, and financial implications of <mark>climate</mark>-related risks and opportunities for Chevron. It fails to meet the expectations of shareholders or align with the TCFD recommendations. Among its shortcomings, the report:</P><UL><LI>Provides no description of how 2°C scenario analysis is integrated into Chevron’s investment decision making or strategic business planning;</LI><LI>Includes limited discussion of market and technological risks to Chevron’s business model and provides no detail on its current or projected low-<mark>carbon</mark> investments;</LI><LI>Does not acknowledge <mark>climate</mark>-related risks to Chevron’s reputation;</LI><LI>Provides some information about Chevron’s assessment of <mark>climate</mark>-related physical risks, but does not disclose how it determines their materiality or how it plans to manage these risks in the future.</LI></UL><H3>Potential investigations and litigation</H3><P>In contrast to the rosy outlook presented in “Managing <mark>Climate Change</mark> Risks,” Chevron’s annual <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93410/000009341017000013/cvx-123116x10kdoc.htm"" target=""_blank"">10-K report</A> for 2016 (filed in February 2017) acknowledged that “Increasing attention to <mark>climate change</mark> risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and, potentially, private litigation against the company.” This is an extraordinary admission, for several reasons:</P><UL><LI>Companies only have to disclose to investors risks that could have a “material adverse effect” on them—that is, risks to their bottom lines. Most companies resist identifying a risk as material until they have no choice but to do so.</LI><LI>To date, only ExxonMobil is known to be under investigation by governmental authorities—specifically, the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts and the SEC. Chevron is apparently concerned that it, too, could face scrutiny for misleading investors and consumers about <mark>climate change</mark>.</LI><LI>Up until recently, Chevron has been limited in its <mark>climate</mark>-related risk disclosure to the SEC. After pressure from UCS and investors, the company did expand its disclosure of physical risk at its refineries, but <A href=""http://blog.ucsusa.org/gretchen-goldman/chevron-exxon-phillips-66-react-to-ucs-stormy-seas-rising-risks-report-698"" target=""_blank"">didn’t explicitly mention</A> <mark>climate change</mark> like this year’s disclosure does.</LI></UL><P>In last year’s <EM><mark>Climate</mark> Accountability Scorecard</EM>, <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2016/10/<mark>climate</mark>-accountability-scorecard-chevron-fact-sheet.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Chevron</A> scored only “fair” on fully disclosing <mark>climate</mark> risks to its shareholders. It remains to be seen whether these additional disclosures will improve Chevron’s score in this area.</P><H3>Direct and indirect lobbying</H3><P>Growing numbers of investors are also seeking more information to assess whether lobbying by major oil and gas companies is consistent with the companies’ expressed goals and in the best interests of shareholders. Chevron again faces a proposal from shareholders requesting annual reporting on direct and indirect lobbying activities and expenditures.</P><P>In 2016, 27% of Chevron shareholders voted for such a <A href=""https://www.ceres.org/investor-network/resolutions/annually-disclose-direct-and-indirect-lobbying-2016"" target=""_blank"">proposal</A>, and the company has not taken any steps that are likely to reduce shareholder concerns in this area.</P><P>This year’s resolution cites Chevron’s lack of transparency about its membership in and contributions to trade associations and industry groups such as the <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/images/2015/07/gw-minigraphic-<mark>climate</mark>-deception-dossier-2-API-roadmap-memo.jpg"" target=""_blank"">American Petroleum Institute (API)</A>, <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/images/2015/07/gw-minigraphic-<mark>climate</mark>-deception-dossier-3-WSPA-ppt.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA)</A>, Business Roundtable, <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/fight-misinformation/whos-fighting-clean-power-plan-and-epa-action-<mark>climate</mark>#bf-toc-6"" target=""_blank"">US Chamber of Commerce (US Chamber)</A>, and <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/images/2015/07/gw-minigraphic-<mark>climate</mark>-deception-dossier-6-ALEC.jpg"" target=""_blank"">American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)</A>.</P><P>UCS’s <EM><mark>Climate</mark> Accountability Scorecard</EM> rated <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2016/10/<mark>climate</mark>-accountability-scorecard-chevron-fact-sheet.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Chevron</A> “egregious” in the area of Renouncing disinformation on <mark>climate</mark> science and policy, due largely to its affiliation with groups like API, WSPA, the US Chamber, and ALEC that spread disinformation on <mark>climate</mark> science and policy.</P><P>Shareholders should not tolerate Chevron’s efforts to dismiss and deny the very real risks posed by <mark>climate change</mark> to our planet, to the company’s business model, and to their investments.

He asked each side to discuss the history of <mark>climate</mark> science and answer eight specific questions, such as: “What are the main sources of heat that account for the incremental rise in temperature on Earth?”</P><P>Boutrous denied that oil companies are responsible for sea-level rise or any associated property damages in California. Based on news reports, he argued from authority, invoking the  U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>’s (IPCC) and its Fifth Assessment Report, published in 2013.</P><P>Specifically, Boutrous cited IPCC data showing decreases in sea level off the West Coast during 1993-2012, highlighted uncertainties in IPCC projections of future sea-level rise, and denied that the IPCC holds any company or group of companies responsible for <mark>climate change</mark>: “The IPCC does not say it’s the extraction and production of oil that is driving these emissions,” he explained. “It’s economic activity that creates the demand for energy, and that leads to emissions.”</P><P>The last point is a good one. Global emission levels reflect the purchasing decisions of billions of customers, who include city officials in San Francisco and Oakland, not the machinations of energy company executives. Consumption and therefore emissions tend to increase when energy prices fall, and decrease when prices rise. If <mark>climate</mark> scolds were consistent, they would applaud high gasoline prices. Instead, they <A href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2006/05/ftc-releases-report-its-investigation-gasoline-price-manipulation"">falsely accuse</A> oil companies of colluding to “<A href=""https://nypost.com/2017/09/17/schumer-urges-feds-to-watch-price-gouging-on-big-oil/"">gouge</A>” consumer.</P><P>Nonetheless, touting the IPCC is not a winning strategy. When it suits their convenience, as was the case at the tutorial, eco-litigants can always cherry pick more recent studies to claim <mark>climate change</mark> is “worse than we [i.e., the IPCC] thought.”</P><P>More importantly, despite acknowledging uncertainties, IPCC reports project severe <mark>climate change</mark> impacts by the late 21<SUP>st</SUP> century. The core IPCC narrative supports the <mark>climate</mark> litigators rather than Chevron.</P><P>In addition, if the oil companies are going to argue from authority, then they should retain credentialed scientists to present their case. That’s what Oakland and San Francisco did. Instead, the oil companies sent a lawyer. Also, if they accept “consensus” as evidentiary, then at least present a united front. Instead, representatives from BP, Conoco Phillips, ExxonMobil, and Royal Dutch Shell said not a word, arousing suspicions that their views may differ from Chevron’s.</P><P>Judge Alsup gave the other defendants two weeks to submit details on any points of disagreement with Chevron. “Otherwise, I'm going to assume you're in agreement,” he said. “You can't get away with sitting there in silence and then later say, ‘He wasn't speaking for us.’”</P><P>Rather than endorse a “consensus” that everybody knows fuels <mark>climate</mark> litigation, Chevron and the other defendants should challenge the scientific bona fides of mainstream climatology. No, I am not suggesting they deny the reality of man-made global warming or speculate about what percentage of recent warming is natural rather than anthropogenic.</P><P>The key point, as explained by Cato Institute scientist <A href=""http://go.cei.org/e/287682/ational-<mark>climate</mark>-assessment-pdf/c9xtf/141452670"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Michaels</A>, is that the IPCC and other self-appointed <mark>climate</mark> authorities use an unscientific methodology. The vast majority of <mark>climate</mark> models “hind-cast” <A href=""http://go.cei.org/e/287682/Y-WState-JChristy-20170329-pdf/c9xth/141452670"" target=""_blank"">two-to-three times</A> as much global warming as has actually occurred in recent decades. Only one model, known as INM-CM4, accurately tracks warming trends both at the surface and in the bulk atmosphere. Instead of using that model to project future warming and <mark>climate change</mark> impacts, the IPCC takes the average of all models, nearly all of which are overheated.</P><P>Compounding the error, mainstream assessment reports typically run the ensemble of overheated models with a “baseline” scenario, called <A href=""https://www.cato.org/blog/time-cool-it-uns-moribund-high-end-global-warming-emissions-scenario"">RCP8.5</A>, in which coal remains the dominant electricity fuel through the end of the century. Just about every energy expert expects natural gas to continue replacing coal as the world’s major electricity fuel. </P><P>When the INM-CM4 model is run with a realistic emission scenario, projected 21<SUP>st</SUP> century warming drops to about 1.5°C. In other words, the world meets the most “ambitious” goal of the <A href=""https://cei.org/expert/marlo-lewis-jr"">Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement</A> but without any punitive <mark>climate</mark> regulations or taxes.</P><P>Michaels, in comments submitted on the U.S. government’s Fourth National Assessment (NA4) report, summarizes the argument energy freedom advocates should make to win in the California litigation and, indeed, in the court of public opinion:</P><P style=""margin-left: 40px;"">NA4 suffers from a fundamental methodological flaw in assuming that models making large bulk errors are representative of a range of future warming. . . . NA4 also pays inadequate attention to the implications of an ongoing seismic shift in world energy towards natural gas. Warming predicted by the one model that does not suffer the bulk errors, coupled with a slightly lower concentration pathway because of forecast switching from coal to natural gas, becomes a net benefit rather than a social cost.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""golden-two-region golden-two-region--second sidebar-region""><DIV class=""contents-container contents-container-pane-blog-by-issues-panel-pane-4""><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-views-panes pane-blog-by-issues-panel-pane-4""><DIV class=""panel-pane-title-container""><H2 class=""pane-title"">More OpenMarket</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

That is double the average expenditure between 2000 and 2008.</P><P>Advocacy groups lobbied independently of, and in partnership with, like-minded corporations. Industry leaders — the <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Nature+Conservancy&amp;year=2009"">Nature Conservancy</A>, <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Environmental+Defense+Fund&amp;year=2009"">Environmental Defense Fund</A> and <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=World+Wildlife+Fund&amp;year=2009"">World Wildlife Fund</A>— hit hardest, investing more than $6 million. The <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=US+<mark>Climate</mark>+Action+Partnership&amp;year=2009"">US <mark>Climate</mark> Action Partnership</A>, an unprecedented conglomeration of leading advocacy groups, energy businesses and some of the U.S. largest producers, spent $1 million independently.</P><P>Yet even as pro-environment groups seemed poised to capitalize on favorable trends, moneyed opponents girded for a fight with more financial capital than ever before. </P><P>Clients in the <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/indusclient.php?year=2009&amp;lname=E01&amp;id="">oil and gas industry</A> unleashed a fury of lobbying expenditures in 2009, spending $175 million — easily an industry record — and outpacing the pro-environmental groups by nearly eight-fold, according to a Center for Responsive Politics analysis. </P><P>Some of the largest petroleum companies in the world together spent hundreds of millions of dollars in various attempts to influence politics during the past 18 months </P><P><A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Exxon+Mobil&amp;year=2009"">ExxonMobil</A>, the industry leader in 2009, spent $27.4 million in lobbying expenditures that year — more than the entire pro-environment lobby. </P><P>And in July, congressional debate on global warming stopped cold. </P><P>In other words, Goliath whipped David.</P><P>“The way it turned out was a huge disappointment, to put it mildly,” Nathan Wilcox, the Federal Global Warming Program Director for <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Environment+America&amp;year=2009"">Environment America</A>, one group that lobbied heavily on comprehensive <mark>climate change</mark> legislation, told <I><A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/blog"">OpenSecrets Blog</A></I>. </P><P>“The opposition outspent us, and they took it to a new level this time.” </P><P><STRONG>MOMENTUM GIVES WAY TO DEFEAT</STRONG></P><P>Though only recently coming to a head, the battle over <mark>climate change</mark> policy — and subsequent dramatic increase in political spending — began a few years earlier for both of these groups.</P><P>Energy and <mark>climate change</mark> became major issues for both groups following the Democratic sweep of the congressional mid-year elections in 2006. Environmental groups scored major victories in the 2008 election cycle, betting heavily on a Democratic majority and the presidential candidacy of <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/summary.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00009638"">Barack Obama</A>. </P><P>Individuals and political action committees <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/totals.php?cycle=2010&amp;ind=Q11"">contributed</A> nearly $5.6 million to political candidates in 2007 and 2008. Ninety-four percent of the total went to Democrats. </P><P>These same groups favored Obama, who campaigned on a promise to aggressively tackle global warming, if elected. Pro-environment groups poured more than $1.2 million into his campaign, <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=Q11&amp;cycle=2008&amp;recipdetail=P&amp;mem=N&amp;sortorder=U"">donating</A> to his campaign over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton’s by a seven-to-one margin.</P><P>Oil and gas groups again <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/totals.php?cycle=2010&amp;ind=E01"">outspent</A> pro-environmental groups considerably, and with their own partisan slant. With more than $35.6 million, individuals and political action committees contributed far more, at a more than six-to-one rate. Seventy-seven percent of contributions from this industry went to Republicans during the 2008 cycle.</P><P>Still, it was pro-environmental groups that backed the winning candidates. And it was pro-environmental groups who carried the political momentum into 2009 and the first legislative battleground in the House of Representatives.</P><P>Advocacy groups pushed hard for a bill that would tackle global warming by placing an economy-wide cap on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. Major industry players lobbied heavily in the first half of the year.  Established leaders favoring the legislation — the <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Environmental+Defense+Fund&amp;year=2009"">Environmental Defense Fund</A>, the <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Natural+Resources+Defense+Council&amp;year=2009"">Natural Resource Defense Council</A>, the <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Sierra+Club&amp;year=2009"">Sierra Club</A>— all lobbied heavily, bringing the industry to more than $4.7 million during the first quarter. </P><P>In the <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/billsum.php?id=107281&amp;lname=H.R.2454"">American Security and Clean Energy Act</A> (H.R. 2454), which passed the House of Representatives in June 2009, most saw a serious victory.</P><P>Wesley Warren, director of programs for the <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Natural+Resources+Defense+Council&amp;year=2009"">Natural Resources Defense Council</A>, today calls the House’s passage of H.R. 2452 “proof” that money isn’t the final arbiter in legislative matters.  </P><P>“It’s not only about the money,” he told <I>OpenSecrets Blog</I>. “Having money helps, but the other side will always have more and they don’t always win.” </P><P>Far from united on the issue, however, many environmental activist groups cried foul over perceived carve-outs for special interests, citing massive amounts of <mark>carbon</mark> offsets given to energy and coal companies, which would exempt large parts of the industries from a cap on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.</P><P><A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Greenpeace&amp;year=2009"">Greenpeace</A>, a group that is well-known for its environmental activism and which also lobbied on the bill in 2009, went on <A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/media-center/news-releases/greenpeace-opposes-waxman-mark/"">record</A> as not supporting the legislation. It called H.R. 2454 a “victory” for lobbyists from industries of oil, coal and others. </P><P>Indeed, looming over the negotiations throughout the first half of the year was the oil and gas industry’s influential shadow.</P><P>During the first half of the year, oil and gas groups spent more than $86.5 million on legislative influence. Some of the largest oil companies in the world — who double as industry spending leaders — lobbied heavily on H.R. 2454. <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=ConocoPhillips&amp;year=2009"">ConocoPhillips</A>, <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=ConocoPhillips&amp;year=2009""><mark>Chevron Corp<</mark>/A>, <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Exxon+Mobil&amp;year=2009"">ExxonMobil</A> and U.S. petroleum conglomerate <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Koch+Industries&amp;year=2009"">Koch Industries</A> each individually spent millions of dollars lobbying Congress that quarter . Each listed H.R. 2454 repeatedly on their federally mandated lobbying reports in 2009.</P><P>“It was a major job-killer,” Bill Bush, a spokesperson for the <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=American+Petroleum+Institute&amp;year=2009"">American Petroleum Institute</A>, a trade association that represents oil and gas interests, told <I>OpenSecrets Blog</I>. “It wasn’t an efficient way to go about the problem of <mark>climate change</mark> — it would have placed a great burden on those Americans who use and are employed by oil and natural gas companies.”</P><P>The fight between pro-environmental and oil and gas groups would only grow more bitter as the fight shifted to the notoriously slow-moving Senate.</P><P><I>Center for Responsive Politics Researcher Matthias Jaime contributed to this report.</I></P><P>Negotiations over legislation to reform the nation’s health care system had inflamed an already deep partisan divide between Democrats and Republicans. It was the perfect situation for opponents of <mark>climate change</mark> legislation: As Democrats wrangled with the moderate factions of their party over health care, oil and gas groups hammered away in the background. </P><P>In the year following the House’s initial passage of H.R. 2454, the oil and gas industry lobbed about $163 million at Congress, bringing their 18 month total to nearly $250 million.  Many of the same leading oil and gas interests lobbying on H.R. 2454 also focused on the Senate versions of the legislation — the <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/billsum.php?id=111838&amp;lname=S.1733"">Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act</A> (S.1733), sponsored by Senators <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00000245&amp;cycle=2010"">John Kerry</A> (Mass.) and <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00006692&amp;cycle=2010"">Barbara Boxer</A> (Calif.), and which later became known as the American Power Act. </P><P>By the time it was over in July of this year, with legislation stalling out in the Senate, the oil and gas industry had outspent environmental interests more than seven-to-one.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS REFLECT</STRONG></P><P>What’s next for environmental groups isn’t completely clear. </P><P>Some of the largest groups, such as the <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Natural+Resources+Defense+Council&amp;year=2009"">Natural Resources Defense Council</A> and the <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Sierra+Club&amp;year=2009"">Sierra Club</A>, are turning their attention to the oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico and the fight to hold oil giant BP responsible for the incident.</P><P>On the fight for comprehensive <mark>climate change</mark> legislation, opinions are mixed as to what it will take to move legislation forward, but many groups argued they’ve already made progress.</P><P>Nathan Wilcox at <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Environment+America&amp;year=2009"">Environment America</A> said he believes environmental groups will “undoubtedly” have to spend more money.  But he also notes that in the process of a long debate, pro-environmental groups succeeded in bringing together many organizations that don’t always agree with one another — something that he thinks helped move legislation forward to some degree.</P><P>“An unprecedented number of groups [came] together in support of <mark>climate</mark>,” he said, including the renewable energy and national security fields. “We really raised the profile of the issue.”</P><P>Such partnerships, notes Bob Bendick, government relations director at the <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Nature+Conservancy&amp;year=2009"">Nature Conservancy</A>, can also help break a standard narrative in the <mark>climate change</mark> debate: that the issue pits jobs against the environment.  </P><P>Bendick cited Nature Conservancy’s work with the <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=US+<mark>Climate</mark>+Action+Partnership&amp;year=2009"">US <mark>Climate</mark> Action Partnership</A> as one example: USCAP, he said, “presented to the American people that this isn’t about: ‘Jobs versus <mark>Climate</mark>’, but that <mark>climate</mark> can be a very important part of the future of our economy.”</P><P>Another advantage groups cited was an ability to bypass Congress and take its message directly to the American people.</P><P>Joe Smyth, a spokesperson for <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Greenpeace&amp;year=2009"">Greenpeace</A>, said environmental groups need to pressure Congress from the bottom-up, rather than relying on buying a seat at a committee room through federal lobbying.</P><P>“We as a community are not going to be able to out-lobby [oil and gas], or other industries,” he said. “We need to take our fight elsewhere. There needs to be grassroots pressure on members of Congress.”</P><P>And grassroots pressure is one thing that advocacy groups do particularly well. With millions of members among them, such an effort may help them outflank oil and gas interests in the next debate.</P><P>As Smyth puts it: “It’s the only way that we are going to break out of the stranglehold they have over the issue.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Also, top proxy advisers recommended votes in favor of a third such resolution set for Exxon Mobil Corp’s (<SPAN id=""”symbol_XOM.N_2”""><A href=""/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=XOM.N"">XOM.N</A></SPAN>) annual meeting on May 31.     </P><P>Activists say the developments suggest they are at an inflection point after years of seeking support from big institutional investors like BlackRock Inc. (<SPAN id=""”symbol_BLK.N_3”""><A href=""/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=BLK.N"">BLK.N</A></SPAN>) The giant New York asset manager switched sides in this year’s vote at Occidental, citing concerns about the company’s pace of disclosures to date.  </P><P>The reports the activists have sought through the advisory shareholder resolutions are sometimes known as “2 degree scenario analysis” reports after the goal of the 2015 Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from preindustrial levels by phasing out fossil fuels. </P><P>The limits could hit companies’ bottom lines such as by reducing the revenue they can expect from extracting fossil fuel reserves. Activists hope that having the companies lay out plans for dealing with future regulatory, technology and market changes will smooth their transition to cleaner energy.  </P><P>Edward Kamonjoh, executive director of the 50/50 <mark>Climate</mark> Project in Washington, which supports the resolutions, said actions by U.S. President Donald Trump like the dismantling of Obama-era <mark>climate</mark> policies may have moved big investors to take on a more active role.  </P><P>While Trump has not so far followed through on a campaign promise to take the United States out of the Paris deal, investors cannot count on strong environmental regulations in the future, he said. </P><P>“Investors who feel that <mark>climate</mark> is a risk now realize they just have themselves to manage this risk in the next few years,” Kamonjoh said. </P><H3>MOOD TEST </H3><P>Most energy company and utility boards have urged their investors to oppose the measures, some arguing they already take <mark>climate change</mark> seriously.  </P><P>A key test of investors’ mood will come at the end of May at Exxon. The largest U.S. oil &amp; gas producer argues a <mark>climate</mark> report is unnecessary because it already conducts reviews that sufficiently test its business for impacts from changing technology and energy demand. </P><P>Exxon has offered other arguments including that it supports the Paris agreement, Exxon Secretary Jeffrey Woodbury told investors in a May 18 letter, and that it has invested nearly $7 billion since 2000 on emissions-reduction technology. </P><P>At PPL, spokesman Ryan Hill said via e-mail that its board “will carefully consider the results and determine the best path forward.” PPL is committed to <mark>sustainable</mark> energy, he said, noting steps it has taken such as retiring coal plants and building Kentucky’s largest solar power facility. </P><P>Some companies have made changes even without votes. Activists including Wespath on May 2 said they withdrew a call for a <mark>climate</mark>-change report from <mark>Chevron Corp,</mark> (<SPAN id=""”symbol_CVX.N_4”""><A href=""/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=CVX.N"">CVX.N</A></SPAN>) citing an 18-page document Chevron issued in March titled “Managing <mark>Climate</mark> Risks” as a good first step.  </P><P>While it did not analyze all the scenarios sought by activists, the report went further than past efforts to outline how <mark>climate change</mark> could affect its profitability.  </P><P>Chevron CEO John Watson said in the report he “shares the concerns of governments and the public about <mark>climate change</mark> risks.”</P><P>Also, Danielle Fugure, president of California nonprofit As You Sow, said last month it withdrew a shareholder resolution calling for a <mark>climate</mark> risk report from Anadarko Petroleum Corp.(<SPAN id=""”symbol_APC.N_5”""><A href=""/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=APC.N"">APC.N</A></SPAN>). In return, she said, the Texas company agreed to continue to work with her group and others to develop methods for reporting on <mark>climate</mark> risks that would be practical for the company but still convey to investors the full extent of the risks it could face. </P><P>Anadarko spokesman John Christiansen confirmed the agreement. “We are consistently looking for ways to further enhance sustainability in our operations, as well as improve transparency regarding these efforts,” he said via e-mail.     </P><P>Fugure said the high vote totals such as at Occidental show how <mark>climate change</mark> is becoming an accepted business issue. “The market itself is moving to take <mark>carbon</mark> risk into account, and the market itself will be pricing <mark>carbon</mark> risk into the value of companies,” she said. </P><DIV class=""container_28wm1""><DIV class=""attribution_o4ojT""><P class=""content_27_rw"">Additional reporting by Gary McWilliams and Ernest Scheyder in Houston; Editing by Cynthia Osterman</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

      </A></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden""><DIV class=""field-items""><DIV class=""field-item even""><P>This week saw two oil companies take two very different approaches to <mark>climate change</mark>. One has recognised the impact that global efforts to cut emissions will have on its bottom line while the other denies <mark>climate</mark> action will have any adverse impact.
	I’m talking about Shell and Chevron. Both behemoths in the energy world but with drastically opposite views sitting on either side of the Atlantic.
	This week <A href=""http://www.shell.com/investors/financial-reporting/annual-publications.html#vanity-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zaGVsbC5jb20vYW5udWFscmVwb3J0"">Shell released its latest annual report</A> for the year up to December 2015. Reading through it, it quickly becomes clear that the company has started joining the dots on <mark>climate change</mark> following the <A href=""//www.desmog.co.uk/2015/12/12/historic-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-major-leap-mankind"">Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement</A> and mounting shareholder pressure.</P><P>The risk of <mark>climate change</mark> to the company is disclosed in-depth: “Rising <mark>climate change</mark> concerns have led and could lead to additional legal and/or regulatory measures which could result in project delays or cancellations, a decrease in demand for fossil fuels and additional compliance obligations, and therefore could adversely impact our costs and/or revenue.”
	It then goes on to talk about the impact increased attention to <mark>climate change</mark> across society will have on its operations, recognising that regulations on greenhouse gas emissions “will focus more on suppressing demand for fossil fuels. This could result in lower revenue.”
	This is a much clearer recognition of the risks posed by <mark>climate change</mark> to a fossil fuel company than Shell had disclosed in the past.<A href=""http://reports.shell.com/annual-report/2014/servicepages/welcome.php"">Last year</A> it stated things more simply: “Rising <mark>climate change</mark> concerns could lead to additional regulatory measures that may result in project delays and higher costs.” There was no mention of the legal risks or direct impact to the company’s profits.<STRONG>Risk Disclosure</STRONG>
	This shift in public risk disclosure is a clear recognition from Shell that policy action and legal risks are mounting. And after the past year Shell’s experienced, it’s a wise move.
	Last May, the oil company’s <A href=""//www.desmog.co.uk/2015/05/19/shell-faces-shareholder-backlash-over-arctic-drilling"">shareholders voted unanimously</A> in favour of a resolution that forced Shell to consider the possibility of a 2C world in its forecasting. Until that time Shell had been <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/17/shell-accused-of-strategy-risking-catastrophic-<mark>climate</mark>-change?CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2"">using a 4C to 6C global warming scenario</A> to guide future business operations (twice the level of warming considered safe for the planet).
	Then, in September Shell was forced to <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/28/shell-ceases-alaska-arctic-drilling-exploratory-well-oil-gas-disappoints"">abandon its plans to drill for Arctic oil</A> off the coast of Alaska citing high costs, uncertain regulatory environment, and the failure to find enough oil and gas to drill. After months of protests against Shell’s Arctic drilling, green campaigners declared this a victory for the environment.
	Finally, it’s hard to ignore the impact of the ‘Exxon knew’ campaign. Last September it was revealed that <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken"">Exxon knew that <mark>climate change</mark> was caused by humans</A> burning fossil fuels long before it went on to promote <mark>climate</mark> science denial and misinformation campaigns. Based on this, New York and California have launched investigations into the oil giant.
	And now, <A href=""http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-congress-shell-<mark>climate</mark>-change-20160218-story.html"">calls have come for a similar investigation</A> to be launched into Shell – did it also deceive the public on <mark>climate change</mark>?
	You can see how this all might push a company into acknowledging the very real financial, regulatory, and legal risks posed to it by <mark>climate change</mark>.<STRONG>Chevron's Position</STRONG>
	Meanwhile, at the other end of the spectrum Chevron is singing a different tune.
	It <A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e34575d6-e603-11e5-a09b-1f8b0d268c39.html#axzz42UQ9czMH"">told the <EM>Financial Times</EM></A> this week that the world will always need Big Oil. Rather than taking a more humble, forward-thinking approach, Chevron’s <SPAN class=""caps"">CEO</SPAN> John Watson boasted that “arguably, we’ve never been more advantaged than right now.”
	As the <EM><SPAN class=""caps"">FT</SPAN></EM>writes: “The idea that curbs on greenhouse gas emissions put the long-term viability of the oil industry at risk has been gaining ground among investors, but John Watson doubts that <mark>climate</mark> policies will be a threat to Chevron.”
	Do a quick search through <A href=""http://www.chevron.com/annualreport/2014/documents/pdf/Chevron2014AnnualReport.pdf"">Chevron’s most recent annual report for 2014</A> (presumably this year’s report for 2015 is in the works) and you’ll find that the company only mentions the words ‘<mark>climate change</mark>’ once <SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;"">–</SPAN> in the context of increased regulations on greenhouse gas emissions.
	Chevron, along with Exxon, has a reputation for not engaging on <mark>climate change</mark>. While European oil majors including Shell signed a joint declaration supporting action on <mark>climate change</mark> ahead of the Paris <SPAN class=""caps"">COP21</SPAN> <mark>climate</mark> conference in December, the two American companies were noticeable in their absence. <STRONG>Public Pressure</STRONG>
	Of course, Shell still has room for improvement – I won’t be letting it off the hook that easy.
	The joint <mark>climate</mark> declaration was <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/oil-companies-deny-that-joint-<mark>climate</mark>-pledge-is-lip-service"">criticised for being little more than hot air</A> given the industry's history of actively lobbying against <mark>climate</mark> action. <SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;"">Last April </SPAN><A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/27/shell-lobbied-to-undermine-eu-renewables-targets-documents-reveal"" style=""line-height: 17.6px;"">it was revealed</A><SPAN style=""line-height: 17.6px;""> that Shell successfully lobbied to undermine European renewable energy targets. Instead, it argued that Europe’s transition to a low <mark>carbon</mark> energy system should focus on gas expansion.</SPAN>
	And as Shell's annual report states, its own internal forecasting assumes an average global temperature increase of 2-3C by 2100 – this is higher than the internationally agreed target of limiting warming to “well below 2C” with the aim of achieving 1.5C. 
	In fact, at <SPAN class=""caps"">COP21</SPAN> David Hone, Shell's head of <mark>climate change</mark>, <A href=""https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/adam-ramsay/gate-crashing-inner-sanctum-of-elite-at-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-talks"">told Adam Ramsay of openDemocracy</A> that oil companies don't see holding warming of the planet to two degrees as “a given”. This view is confirmed in its report, which reads: “Based on the above analysis, we believe current oil, gas and <SPAN class=""caps""><mark>CO2</mark></SPAN> prices are too low to stimulate the fossil fuel substitution necessary to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the average global temperature increase to well below 2°C.”
	But what Shell’s recent admission does is it recognises that public pressure for action on <mark>climate change</mark> is only going to keep increasing. And, it shows that this pressure is starting to be felt at the very heart of the fossil fuel industry.

The New York attorney general is investigating Exxon and it has complained of being unfairly targeted by special interest groups.</P><P>The raft of proposals up for vote at the two companies more than doubled to 11 this year, the latest sign that environmental concerns once considered peripheral by many investors have become mainstream. Even the most traditional shareholder groups are now urging companies to detail how they will plan for the future after 195 governments agreed in December to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) through combined national pledges to cut <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from fossil fuels.</P><P>“Companies like Exxon and Chevron, they’re clinging to bygone assumptions,” said Anne Simpson of CalPERS, which holds Exxon shares worth about $1 billion and has supported some of the measures. “This is their Kodak moment. If they want to still be in business in 30 years, they have to understand the changes that are taking place.”</P><P>Though “Kodak moment” was originally an advertising slogan for film and cameras, it can now refer to Eastman Kodak’s plunge into bankruptcy in 2012 after it failed to capitalize on the digital camera revolution. Simpson said Exxon and Chevron should ramp up investments in clean energy to avoid being caught by sudden technology shifts.</P><P>While BP Plc <A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""BP"">(BP)</A>, Statoil ASA <A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""stohf"">(stohf)</A> and other European oil companies including <A href=""http://fortune.com/2016/05/16/shell-new-energies-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">Royal Dutch Shell</A><A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""rdsa"">(rdsa)</A> have begun releasing myriad data points on how their businesses will respond to <mark>climate change</mark>, Chevron and Exxon have lagged them, critics say.</P><P>Success of any one of the <mark>climate</mark>-related votes at Wednesday’s meetings is not certain.</P><P>Exxon shareholders have never approved a <mark>climate change</mark>-related proposal, and last year they rejected by 79 percent a request that a <mark>climate</mark> expert be appointed to the company’s board.</P><P>Another measure, which would have the companies increase payouts to shareholders and stop investing in oil and gas deposits, appears doomed to fail.</P><P>Still, environmentalists and some investors, sensing the tide turning in their favor, hope to notch at least some victories.</P><P>Already, proxy advisory firm ISS has recommended shareholders of both companies support the resolutions, a key voice of support.</P><P>Exxon lost a public battle with New York State’s comptroller earlier this year when the U.S. <A href=""http://fortune.com/2016/03/23/exxon-mobil-<mark>climate</mark>-change-vote/"">Securities and Exchange Commission ruled it must let shareholders vote</A> on a proposal that would require it to detail how its business will be hurt as governments crack down on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.</P><P>“We believe it’s incumbent upon us as owners to find out what they’re doing (on <mark>climate</mark> research) and how that will affect their long-term business plan,” said Pete Trannis of New York State’s comptroller’s office. “It’s almost impossible to imagine they haven’t been doing some of this already.”</P><P>The so-called proxy access measure, which says minority shareholders with a 3 percent stake should be able to nominate directors to the company’s board, could pass this year after winning support from mutual fund behemoth Vanguard.</P><P>More than a dozen oil companies have passed proxy access, though Exxon’s board has opposed it. Insiders at oil companies worry proxy access could lead to <mark>climate</mark> activists opposed to oil drilling being voted on to company boards.</P><P>Though both Exxon and Chevron say their <mark>climate</mark> disclosures are plenty robust, shareholders are demanding more at annual meetings, partly because the SEC has declined their requests to tighten its 2010 rule requiring all U.S. companies to address potential <mark>climate change</mark> impacts.</P><P>“For the most part the SEC has not been too responsive, so investors have had to turn to other methods,” said Jim Coburn of Ceres, a sustainability group that has advocated at the SEC for tougher <mark>climate</mark> standards as far back as 2007 with CalPERS, the New York attorney general’s office and numerous state treasurers.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""bottom-recirc padded-mobile "" data-tracking-zone=""bottom-recirc""><DIV class=""component lead-gen clearfix bottom-recirc"" data-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-mobile-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-partial=""sponsored-tile"" data-variation=""bottom-recirc"" data-title=""SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT"" data-provider=""dianomi"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-bottom-recirc"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-right-rail"" data-logo=""http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png"" data-logo_url=""https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&amp;utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank"" data-native_ad=""%7B%22dimensions%22%3A%22482x100%22%2C%22placement%22%3A%22footer%22%2C%22priority%22%3A6%7D"" data-nativekey=""wAcSQW5rUVzGCkuf6AZTLmdV""><DIV class=""title-wrapper""><H3 class=""subtitle"">SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It is about whether a court like this one is  the right way to deal with it.&quot;</P><P>Tutorial sessions are occasionally used by judges to gain  background on scientifically or technologically complex cases. For this  session, Alsup asked for information about the history of scientific study of  <mark>climate change</mark> and current science on global warming and sea level rise. He  gave each side two hours.</P><P>Boutrous said Chevron is relying on a 2013 report by the  Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, an international agency that  synthesizes research by hundreds of scientists.</P><P>He said Chevron accepts the report's conclusion that &quot;It is  extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the  observed warming since the mid-20th century.&quot;</P><P>But Boutrous sought to emphasize parts of the IPCC report and  other reports that showed uncertainty in predicting the extent of future  temperature and sea-level increases.</P><P>In one example, Boutrous showed a 2017 state of California report  that showed a 96 percent chance of a rise of one foot in the sea level at the  Golden Gate entrance to San Francisco Bay by 2100, a 70 percent chance of a  2-foot rise and a 28 percent chance of a 3-foot rise.</P><P>But Alsup commented, &quot;In other words, there's a 50-50 chance of  something between two and three feet. That's still a lot of water, isn't it?&quot;</P><P>In addition to Chevron, the other companies sued are BP PLC,  ConocoPhillips Co., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC. The other  companies did not make presentations today, but Alsup instructed them to tell  him within two weeks of any Chevron statements they disagree with. Otherwise,  they will be deemed to agree, he said.</P><P>While Chevron chose a lawyer for its tutorial, San Francisco and  Oakland selected three scientists.</P><P>Gary Griggs, an earth sciences professor at the University of  California at Santa Cruz, noted that the 2017 California report said the rate  of ice melting in Antarctica and Greenland has increased and that &quot;waiting  for absolute certainty is not an option.&quot;</P><P>Griggs said the effects of sea level rises are worsened by other  phenomena such as king tides and El Nino events.</P><P>He showed pictures of the San Francisco Embarcadero flooded during  a king tide and a hypothetical map showing that more than half of Oakland  International Airport would be submerged if the sea level rises by 3 feet.</P><P>University of Illinois atmospheric science professor Don Wuebbles,  who contributed to the 2013 IPCC report, said, &quot;The science did not stop at  2012. There is a lot we have learned in the past five years.&quot;</P><P>Wuebbles said predictions are now more certain and the rate of  increase in sea level is higher than at any time in the last 2,800 years.</P><P>&quot;Our projections are a rise of one to 4 feet by the end of the  century, but it could be as high as 8 feet,&quot; he said.</P><P>Alsup has set a briefing schedule for the companies' motion to  dismiss that could extend to the end of April, meaning that a hearing would  not be held until May.</P><P>San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement  today, &quot;What we saw today was one oil company begrudgingly accepting the  scientific consensus while trying to overemphasize the extent of scientific  uncertainty.</P><P>&quot;These companies have made enormous profits while putting our  cities in harm's way. Now the bill has come due. It's time for them to pay  for the seawalls and other infrastructure needed to protect San Francisco and  Oakland,&quot; Herrera said.</P><P>###</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></BODY></HTML>"

<A href=""http://www.sfexaminer.com/author/bcn_sfex/"" title=""Posts by Bay City News"" class=""author url fn"" rel=""author"">Bay City News</A> on March 21, 2018 5:40 pm</DIV><P>A lawyer for <mark>Chevron Corp.</mark> told a federal judge in San Francisco Wednesday that the company “accepts the consensus of the scientific community” that <mark>climate change</mark> is real and is caused primarily by human activity.</P><P>“That has been Chevron’s position for a decade,” attorney Theodore Boutrous told U.S. District Judge William Alsup.</P><P>Boutrous spoke at an unusual tutorial session scheduled by Alsup in connection with two lawsuits filed against San Ramon-based Chevron and four other oil and gas companies by San Francisco and Oakland.</P><P>The cities claim the corporations created a public nuisance by promoting the use of oil and natural gas while knowing that the fuels lead to the “grave danger” of global warming and rising sea levels. </P><P>They also claim the companies engaged in public relations campaigns to downplay the risks in the 1990s and early 2000s.</P><P>The suits ask for financial compensation, possibly in the billions of dollars, to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to protect people and property against rising sea levels and global warming.</P><P>Alsup did not issue any rulings during the session, but is expected to schedule a hearing later this spring on a bid by the five companies for dismissal of the case.</P><P>The companies claim in a motion filed Tuesday that the case doesn’t belong in federal court.</P><P>“There’s no doubt that warming is a global issue that requires global debate and engagement,” Boutrous told Alsup. “This is not a case about whether global warming exists. It is about whether a court like this one is the right way to deal with it.”</P><P>Tutorial sessions are occasionally used by judges to gain background on scientifically or technologically complex cases. For this session, Alsup asked for information about the history of scientific study of <mark>climate change</mark> and current science on global warming and sea level rise. He gave each side two hours. </P><P>Boutrous said Chevron is relying on a 2013 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, an international agency that synthesizes research by hundreds of scientists.</P><P>He said Chevron accepts the report’s conclusion that “It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.”</P><P>But Boutrous sought to emphasize parts of the IPCC report and other reports that showed uncertainty in predicting the extent of future temperature and sea-level increases.</P><P>In one example, Boutrous showed a 2017 state of California report that showed a 96 percent chance of a rise of one foot in the sea level at the Golden Gate entrance to San Francisco Bay by 2100, a 70 percent chance of a 2-foot rise and a 28 percent chance of a 3-foot rise. </P><P>But Alsup commented, “In other words, there’s a 50-50 chance of something between two and three feet. That’s still a lot of water, isn’t it?”</P><P>In addition to Chevron, the other companies sued are BP PLC, ConocoPhillips Co., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC. The other companies did not make presentations today, but Alsup instructed them to tell him within two weeks of any Chevron statements they disagree with. Otherwise, they will be deemed to agree, he said. </P><P>While Chevron chose a lawyer for its tutorial, San Francisco and Oakland selected three scientists.</P><P>Gary Griggs, an earth sciences professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz, noted that the 2017 California report said the rate of ice melting in Antarctica and Greenland has increased and that “waiting for absolute certainty is not an option.”</P><P>Griggs said the effects of sea level rises are worsened by other phenomena such as king tides and El Nino events.</P><P>He showed pictures of the San Francisco Embarcadero flooded during a king tide and a hypothetical map showing that more than half of Oakland International Airport would be submerged if the sea level rises by 3 feet.</P><P>University of Illinois atmospheric science professor Don Wuebbles, who contributed to the 2013 IPCC report, said, “The science did not stop at 2012. There is a lot we have learned in the past five years.”</P><P>Wuebbles said predictions are now more certain and the rate of increase in sea level is higher than at any time in the last 2,800 years.</P><P>“Our projections are a rise of one to 4 feet by the end of the century, but it could be as high as 8 feet,” he said.</P><P>Alsup has set a briefing schedule for the companies’ motion to dismiss that could extend to the end of April, meaning that a hearing would not be held until May.</P><P>San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement, “What we saw today was one oil company begrudgingly accepting the scientific consensus while trying to overemphasize the extent of scientific uncertainty.</P><P>“These companies have made enormous profits while putting our cities in harm’s way. Now the bill has come due. It’s time for them to pay for the seawalls and other infrastructure needed to protect San Francisco and Oakland,” Herrera said. </P><P><EM>-Julia Cheever, Bay City News</EM></P><H2><A href=""#disqus_comments"">Click here</A> or scroll down to comment</H2><DIV class=""extras-mobile""><H3>Trending Articles</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The willingness of Chevron's legal counsel to openly say as much in federal court was viewed as a sign by some in the media that the company has opted to employ the same ill-fated defense that several large tobacco companies used in response to the <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Philip_Morris#Outcome"" rel=""nofollow"">famous 1990s federal RICO case</A>, <EM>United States vs. Philip Morris</EM> (<A href=""https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PM"" title=""Philip Morris International Inc."">PM</A>), and subsequent lawsuits brought by individuals. A column in <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/23/in-court-big-oil-rejected-<mark>climate</mark>-denial"" rel=""nofollow""><EM>The Guardian</EM></A> was quick to point out the similarities:</P><BLOCKQUOTE itemprop=""citation"" class=""p p2""><P><EM>Although they accept the expert <mark>climate</mark> consensus, the oil companies obviously don't want to be held liable for the costs of the <mark>climate</mark> damages their products cause. In addition to emphasizing and exaggerating <mark>climate</mark> science uncertainties, Chevron's lawyer noted that the IPCC states that <mark>climate change</mark> is caused &quot;largely by economic and population growth,&quot; not fossil fuel extraction. In other words, the oil industry's strategy is to argue that individual <mark>climate</mark> impacts are difficult to pin down, and in any case, the blame lies not with the producers, but with the consumers of their products.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p p2"">No less of a figure than the actor and former Republican governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is planning lawsuits on the same grounds against major oil and gas producers for &quot;knowingly killing people all over the world&quot; via <mark>climate change</mark>. <A href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2018/03/13/arnold-schwarzenegger-sue-oil-companies-first-degree-murder/419368002/"" rel=""nofollow"">As reported</A> by <EM>USA Today</EM>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE itemprop=""citation"" class=""p p2""><P><EM>In the podcast, Schwarzenegger compares the issue to the tobacco industry.</EM></P><P><EM>&quot;This is no different from the smoking issue. The tobacco industry knew for years and years and years and decades, that smoking would kill people, would harm people and create cancer, and were hiding that fact from the people and denied it,&quot; Schwarzenegger said. &quot;Then eventually they were taken to court and had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars because of that...&quot;</EM></P><P><EM>&quot;We're going to go after them, and we're going to be in there like an Alabama tick. Because to me it's absolutely irresponsible to know that your product is killing people and not have a warning label on it, like tobacco,&quot; he said.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p p2"">Like <EM>The Guardian</EM> and Schwarzenegger, supporters of the California lawsuits are quick to draw similarities between the Big Tobacco lawsuits of the 1990s and the more recent Big Oil lawsuits, not least because of the vast damages that were imposed on the former (although tobacco companies remain very valuable, suggesting that NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio's <A href=""https://seekingalpha.com/article/4155870-new-threat-exxon-mobil"">stated intention</A> of using the lawsuits to drive fossil fuel producers out of business is unlikely to succeed). Likewise, investors in Chevron and its peers are wary of the comparison for the same reason. The fact that the lawsuit brought by the California municipalities has yet to be dismissed despite being <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kivalina_v._ExxonMobil_Corp."" rel=""nofollow"">unsupported by precedent</A> provides oil and gas investors with at least some cause for concern.</P><P class=""p p3"">That said, the comparison between the <mark>climate change</mark> lawsuits and those against tobacco firms is legally specious for a few different reasons. First, the lawsuits against the latter frequently revolved around allegations of fraudulent activity in which the tobacco companies privately knew about the dangers of smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption but publicly denied them to their customers. These dangers were very easy to establish due to the fact that tobacco consumption has a number of well-established negative impacts on human health (lung disease, various forms of cancer, heart disease, etc.) and welfare (expense, immobility, nicotine addiction, etc.), whereas the benefits are virtually non-existent (satisfying an addiction doesn't count when the addiction is first created by the activity in question).</P><P class=""p p3"">Fossil fuel consumption and, by extension, combustion, are characterized by a very different cost-benefit analysis. The dangers of fossil fuel combustion have been well-established, of course: fuels such as coal and petroleum cause localized health impacts not dissimilar to those caused by tobacco consumption, and all fossil fuel combustion at present contributes to <mark>climate change</mark>, with all that it entails, via a rising atmospheric <mark>CO2</mark> concentration.</P><P class=""p p3"">That said, fossil fuel consumption also results in a large number of benefits to both human health and welfare. It is no coincidence that the average human life expectancy was the same in 1900 as it was during the Paleolithic, but then <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"" rel=""nofollow"">more than doubled</A> between 1900 and 2014 as fossil fuel consumption became widespread. The tremendous energy density and efficiency of those fuels allowed humans to move away from subsistence agrarian economies in which the large majority of the population was involved in food production towards more modern economies characterized by high education levels and the resulting advances in science, medicine, engineering, and technology. A reliance on primitive renewable sources of energy due to an absence of fossil fuel availability in the world's poorest countries today continues to harm human health on a daily basis. While these benefits are mitigated by the harm wrought by fossil fuel consumption, they cannot be ignored.</P><P class=""p p4"">The second reason that I consider the comparison between the Big Tobacco and Big Oil lawsuits to be specious is because of how blame is apportioned. There is a direct link between a person's human health and tobacco consumption: specifically, tobacco consumption places a person at much greater risk of suffering from often-fatal medical complications. If someone consumes a company's tobacco products over an extended period of time and then develops lung cancer, it is reasonable to conclude that the latter was caused by the former.</P><P class=""p p4"">Apportioning blame for greenhouse gas emissions is vastly more difficult due to the tremendous volume of emissions that has occurred in the 200 years since the Industrial Revolution began. As Stanford University's Richard Epstein put it:</P><BLOCKQUOTE itemprop=""citation"" class=""p p4""><P><EM>These five oil companies are responsible at most for a tiny fraction of the global total of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions...vast amounts of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide are released from a similar range of human activities all across the globe.</EM></P><P><EM>Here are some numbers: As of 2015, all</EM><A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_<mark>carbon</mark>_dioxide_emissions"" rel=""nofollow""><EM><mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions</EM></A><EM>from the United States comprised 14.34 percent of the global total, while China's emissions stood at 29.51 percent. Even if the five oil companies were somehow responsible for, say, 10 percent of the United States' <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions, that would be less than one percent of the total human releases. Under standard tort rules, the liability of each defendant must be limited to its own pro rata share of the total harm given that under</EM><A href=""https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I82ca8d9adc1611e2ac56d4437d510c12/View/FullText.html?transitionType=UniqueDocItem&amp;contextData=%28sc.Search%29&amp;userEnteredCitation=Restatement+SEcond+of+Torts+Section+433A"" rel=""nofollow""><EM>Section 433A</EM></A><EM>of the Restatement of Torts, there is a &quot;reasonable basis for determining the contribution of each cause to a single harm,&quot; in this instance measured by market shares.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p p4"">Even this ignores the nature of the negative externality created by fossil fuel consumption. Unlike tobacco consumption, which only benefits the tobacco company, fossil fuel consumption benefits both the fossil fuel producer <EM>and</EM> the individual who creates the emissions by burning that fossil fuel (by commuting to work with an internal combustion engine, by flying on a jet plane over vacation, by heating their home with natural gas, etc.). While the aforementioned column in <EM>The Guardian</EM> categorizes this approach as &quot;blame the consumer&quot;, the comparisons with the nominally-similar defense used by tobacco firms in the 1990s are unconvincing because of the very real benefits provided to consumers of fossil fuels by their use that are not made available to tobacco consumers.</P><P class=""p p5"">It is not my intention to downplay what happened in court last week: legal counsel for Chevron, a major fossil fuel producer, openly and unambiguously admitted that the use of its products is contributing to <mark>climate change</mark>. The fact that the lawsuit in question even made it far enough to cause this to happen means that there is at least some chance (albeit a remote one) that the federal district court in question will rule against the company. That said, given the reasons outlined above I am not surprised that the company's share price responded to the news by outperforming the S&amp;P 500 last week by almost three percentage points (see figure). Put simply, the comparison to the Big Tobacco lawsuits is unconvincing on both the merits and likely outcome.</P><P class=""p p5""><FIGURE class=""sa-widget sa-ycharts"" data-id=""null"" data-name=""null""><A href=""http://ycharts.com/companies/CVX/intraday_price"" rel=""nofollow""><EM>CVX Price</EM></A><EM> data by </EM><A href=""http://ycharts.com"" rel=""nofollow""><EM>YCharts</EM></A></FIGURE></P><P id=""a-disclosure"" class=""p p5""><B>Disclosure:</B><SPAN>I am/we are long XLE.</SPAN></P><P class=""p p5"">I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

                  ive oil companies including Chevron and ExxonMobil argued that because the heating of the planet is a “collective” problem, legal efforts by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland to wring billions of dollars in damages from fossil-fuel firms for coastal flooding are misguided.</P><P>U.S. District Judge William Alsup ordered the unusual <mark>climate</mark> “tutorial” to better understand a pair of lawsuits that the cities have filed against the companies.

He <A href=""https://hbsslaw.com/cases/jack-in-the-box"" target=""_blank"">forced</A> Jack-in-the-Box to pay $12 million for causing an <I>E. coli</I> outbreak that killed four children. He won a $215 million settlement <A href=""https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/enron"" target=""_blank"">against</A> Enron for defrauding investors and wiping out employee retirement accounts. He <A href=""https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/vw-franchise-dealerships"" target=""_blank"">represented</A> auto dealers in a $1.6 billion lawsuit against Volkswagen for cheating on diesel emissions. </P><P>Berman is best known, though, for suing big tobacco in the 1990s. At the end of that fight, he <A href=""https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/state-tobacco-litigation"" target=""_blank"">helped negotiate</A> a $206 billion settlement from cigarette makers like Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and Brown &amp; Williamson for causing cancer. It remains the largest legal settlement of its kind in history. </P><P>But Berman is now working on a lawsuit that could be even bigger: He is suing five of the world’s most powerful oil companies for causing <mark>climate change</mark>. He represents Oakland and San Francisco in a lawsuit filed last September demanding that Exxon, Shell, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and BP pay billions for sea walls and other defenses against ocean rise.</P><P>Just like with tobacco, the case could hinge on whether these companies lied to the public about the dangers of their business model. Berman has evidence that companies like Exxon knew burning oil causes <mark>climate change</mark> as early as the 1950s. Internally, oil companies <A href=""http://graphics.latimes.com/oil-operations/"" target=""_blank"">took steps</A> to protect their offshore oil rigs and Arctic pipelines from global warming while publicly they denied the science—the same way cigarette makers did research into cancer while denying their product was harmful. “Defendants stole a page from the Big Tobacco playbook,” the lawsuit <A href=""https://www.hbsslaw.com/uploads/case_downloads/<mark>climate</mark>_change/2017-09-19complaintforpublicnuisance.pdf"" target=""_blank"">alleges</A>.</P><P>Legally speaking, that argument might not be such a stretch. “The parallels to tobacco are quite clear,” Carroll Muffett, the president of the Washington, DC–based Center for International Environmental Law, told me. </P><P>Still, nobody has won a lawsuit like this and the oil companies I contacted didn’t seem to think Berman’s would be any different. “Should this litigation proceed,” a spokesperson for Chevron wrote in an email, “it will only serve special interests at the expense of broader policy, regulatory, and economic priorities.” Other, less biased observers also have doubts. “I’m not that sure actually,” said Martin Olszynski, a University of Calgary law professor <A href=""https://ablawg.ca/2017/04/26/do-comparisons-between-tobacco-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change-liability-withstand-scrutiny/"" target=""_blank"">who has researched</A> the parallels between oil and tobacco. “It seems obvious that at some point the defendants will say, ‘But look, there was demand for our product.’” </P><P>Berman himself failed to win a similar lawsuit in 2012, when a court <A href=""http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>change/2012/09/26/9th-circuit-affirms-dismissal-in-kivalina-v-exxonmobil/"" target=""_blank"">dismissed</A> his attempt to hold Exxon and about two dozen other fossil fuel producers responsible for the sea rise swallowing an Alaskan village. But a lot has changed since then. Science linking individual corporations to <mark>climate change</mark> is more sophisticated. Incriminating oil company documents are surfacing. New court decisions—especially a <A href=""http://beta.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-lead-paint-ruling-20171115-story.html"" target=""_blank"">recent ruling</A> against lead paint companies—are removing legal barriers. Suing big oil could be one way to win real environmental gains in the Trump era. “We have the federal government claiming there’s no <mark>climate change</mark>, we have the EPA rolling back,” Berman told me in an interview from his office on the 33rd floor of a Seattle high-rise. “[We can] use the law to accomplish what politicians won’t do.”</P><P>The reason not to dismiss Berman is that he has a history of proving doubters wrong. When he entered the legal fight against tobacco companies in the 1990s, mainstream opinion was that he would be unsuccessful. The owners of brands like Marlboro and Camel had crushed hundreds of lawsuits attempting to link cigarettes to cancer and emphysema. “No one had ever won a tobacco case,” Berman said. His own law partner was wary of getting involved. But in late 1998, the industry surrendered and agreed <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB911777383137557500"" target=""_blank"">to pay out</A> hundreds of billions of dollars. <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/mollenkamp-tobacco.html"" target=""_blank""><I>The People Vs. Big Tobacco</I></A>, a book about the case, described Berman as one of the “crucial players.”</P><P>The stakes are even higher in his big oil lawsuit. Berman is not just trying to get oil companies to pay for seawalls in the Bay Area. In a broader sense he’s attempting to hold them responsible for endangering all human life on earth. “This is different in kind from anything else,” Timothy Crosland, the director of a UK-based <mark>climate</mark> law group called Plan B, told me. “Once you get started, you get one case that goes through, this is an avalanche. It’s got the potential really to bring down the fossil fuel companies.” </P><P class=""article__text--dropcap"">For insight into Berman’s worldview it helps to go back to his 1960s upbringing in Highland Park, a Chicago suburb. “It was a really evolutionary time,” he said. “I grew up with a mother who was one of the first women to burn her bra.” His dad wanted to be a career Army officer but grew disillusioned by the Vietnam War and ended up running an insurance company. “He kind of became liberal himself,” Berman said. </P><P>Others he knew evolved from progressive to militant. They set off bombs and ran from the law. “They were elder brothers of some of my close friends and I’ve never seen them again,” Berman said. Though he’s not sure if they officially belonged to the <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground"" target=""_blank"">Weather Underground</A>, the left-wing organization that bombed US government buildings and banks in the 1970s and broke Timothy Leary out of jail, “they were in that genre of people out there doing radical stuff.” Berman chose to embrace the law. “The way to make change is to get trained in what the establishment does and make change through the process,” <A href=""https://www.superlawyers.com/washington/article/keep-it-simple-stupid/89fccc82-840a-4a05-8b25-3e8dc951a1c8.html"" target=""_blank"">he later told</A> the publication Super Lawyers.</P><P>Berman went to law school and moved out to Seattle, where he got hired by a firm that mostly did defense work for companies in industries like insurance. Berman was part of a smaller team at the firm that sued companies instead. In 1993, he met with a parent whose child had lost a kidney after eating at Jack in the Box and getting food poisoning. “I remember sitting in the room thinking, ‘This could have been my kid,’” he said. “I was so choked up I could barely talk.” His superiors at the firm didn’t want to take the case. “So I said, ‘I’m out of here.” </P><P>Berman and a colleague Carl Hagens <A href=""https://www.superlawyers.com/washington/article/keep-it-simple-stupid/89fccc82-840a-4a05-8b25-3e8dc951a1c8.html"" target=""_blank"">formed</A> their own firm, Hagens Berman. He’d wanted to set out on his own for some time and here was the perfect excuse. Two years later <A href=""https://hbsslaw.com/cases/jack-in-the-box"" target=""_blank"">they settled</A> with Jack in the Box for $12 million. </P><P>That case was tiny compared to what came next. In 1996, Washington’s attorney general hired Berman’s new firm to represent the state in a wave of public health lawsuits against tobacco companies. Soon Berman <A href=""https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/state-tobacco-litigation"" target=""_blank"">represented</A> 13 states. “The quiet youthful [lawyer] worked brutal hours to make up for his firm’s small size, arriving at his office at six AM and staying until nine or ten PM six days a week,” reads the book <A href=""https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-385-31935-5"" target=""_blank""><I>Civil Warriors: The Legal Siege on the Tobacco Industry</I></A>. His law partner was skeptical, according to Berman. “He was afraid we would lose the case,” he said. “If we devoted all our time to a losing effort and we didn’t have any income we could go under.”</P><P>It was a legitimate concern. By then hundreds of tobacco lawsuits had failed. Cigarette makers argued smoking was a personal choice. They pointed to research—often funded by the tobacco industry —<A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/15/us/tobacco-chiefs-say-cigarettes-aren-t-addictive.html?pagewanted=all"" target=""_blank"">casting doubt</A> on the link between cigarettes and cancer. But several factors aligned to make the industry vulnerable to litigation. A series of whistleblowers <A href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1996/05/wigand199605"" target=""_blank"">revealed</A> that tobacco companies knew smoking is addictive and causes cancer. Secret corporate documents showed companies did market research on how to <A href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/tobacco/stories/memos1.htm"" target=""_blank"">target children</A> with ads and branding. Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore filed a lawsuit <A href=""https://www.npr.org/2017/10/17/558390569/after-taking-on-big-tobacco-20-years-ago-former-mississippi-ag-is-trying-again-w"" target=""_blank"">demanding</A> tobacco companies pay the healthcare costs of smokers who’d become sick. And by 1998, 46 states were demanding the same.</P><P>Berman gave the opening statement at the trial in Washington in front of hundreds of people who had crowded into a Seattle courthouse. “I had a big poster that said, ‘The Industry’s Five Big Lies,’ and I went through each one,” he recalled. By then the industry was ready to surrender. Berman, Moore and others had been holding meetings with its leaders to negotiate the terms. On November, 1998, Big tobacco <A href=""http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Tobacco-Suit-Settled-for-206-Billion-46-states-2976948.php"" target=""_blank"">officially agreed</A> to pay $206 billion to 46 states. It received immunity from lawsuits similar to the ones led by Moore and Berman. Yet it was still a massive victory. “We were pretty damn happy,” he said.</P><P class=""article__pull-quote"">How can you prove that oil dug out of the ground by Exxon is causing a tiny Alaskan village to disappear?</P><P class=""article__text--dropcap"">Berman now had a game plan for defeating powerful industries: Accuse them of misleading the public to protect revenues, then find plaintiffs who are suffering the consequences. In the late 2000s, he heard about a coastal village in Alaska called Kivalina that would have to be relocated because of rising oceans. The move could <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/20090615/alaskas-soon-be-<mark>climate</mark>-refugees-sue-energy-companies-relocation"" target=""_blank"">cost up to $400 million</A>, according to his lawsuit, and the Army Corps of Engineers said <mark>climate change</mark> is to blame. Berman sued Exxon, Chevron, BP, ConocoPhillips, and 20 other fossil fuel producers on behalf of the villagers, arguing these companies spread doubt and confusion about <mark>climate change</mark> knowing communities such as Kivalina are in danger. Exxon, for instance, <A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/705605-xom-nyt-2000-3-23-unsettledscience.html"" target=""_blank"">had run</A> full-page <I>New York Times </I>ads about “unsettled science.”</P><P>“You’re not asking the court to evaluate the reasonableness of the conduct… You’re asking a court to evaluate if somebody conspired to lie,” Berman <A href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/06/conspiracy-theory/306812/"" target=""_blank"">told </A><A href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/06/conspiracy-theory/306812/"" target=""_blank""><I>The Atlantic</I></A> at the time. </P><P>Berman flew to Kivalina at one point. The village is built on an island off the west coast of Alaska. Its 400 or so indigenous residents had watched helplessly as shoreline disappeared, winter storms got fiercer, and waves lapped closer to the school. There was a pervasive feeling of despair. “The island is sad, sad that it’s going away,” he said. The magnitude of <mark>climate change</mark> hit him on the flight home. “You could see acres of dying trees from the pine bark beetle,” he said. “That was really striking.” A federal court <A href=""http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>change/2012/09/26/9th-circuit-affirms-dismissal-in-kivalina-v-exxonmobil/"" target=""_blank"">dismissed</A> the lawsuit, deciding that who’s to blame for <mark>climate change</mark> is a job best left to entities like Congress or the White House. But the real issue was causation. How can you prove that oil dug out of the ground by Exxon is causing a tiny Alaskan village to disappear? </P><P>“There is no realistic possibility of tracing any particular alleged effect of global warming to any particular emissions by any specific person, entity, group at any particular point in time,” <A href=""https://www.informea.org/sites/default/files/court-decisions/COU-158012.pdf"" target=""_blank"">wrote</A> US District Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong. It’s a tough obstacle to surmount. “In <mark>climate change</mark> there’s a lot of diffuse actors,” said the University of Calgary’s Olszynski. “It’s not just the oil companies.”</P><P>But there are several reasons Berman’s new lawsuit against big oil could be more successful. Whereas Kivalina was filed in federal court, he wants to represent the cities of San Francisco and Oakland in California state court, which he thinks may be less likely to decide the case raises political questions outside of its jurisdiction. And, he added, “Some people believe that there are more conservative judges on the federal bench.” The defense team for big oil is fighting to get the suit heard federally. The case was “going to be mired down for the next three or four months in a procedural battle,” Berman predicted. </P><P>There have also been big leaps in <mark>climate</mark> science. Researchers like Richard Heede <A href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/08/just-90-companies-are-blame-most-<mark>climate</mark>-change-<mark>carbon</mark>-accountant-says"" target=""_blank"">have calculated</A> that close to two-thirds of greenhouse gases emitted over the last 150 years can be traced back to just 90 companies. Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell and ConocoPhillips <A href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-013-0986-y"" target=""_blank"">are in the top ten</A>. “We have better science,” Berman argued. “We think causation will be easier to prove.”</P><P>Financial damages from <mark>climate change</mark> are also more quantifiable. San Francisco estimates sea-level rise <A href=""https://www.hbsslaw.com/uploads/case_downloads/<mark>climate</mark>_change/2017-09-19complaintforpublicnuisance.pdf"" target=""_blank"">could threaten</A> $49 billion in property. “The major coastal cities in America and abroad have people worried about this,” he said. “That’s a big advancement since the Kivalina case.”</P><P>Incriminating oil industry documents, meanwhile, continue to surface. A report released in mid-November by the Center for International Environmental Law has new evidence that big oil was warned about the risks of global temperature rise nearly 50 years ago. “There seems to be no doubt that the potential damage to our environment could be severe,” <A href=""http://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Smoke-Fumes-FINAL.pdf"" target=""_blank"">explains</A> a 1969 study prepared for the American Petroleum Institute by two Stanford scientists. This wasn’t a one-off thing. “From the late 1960s onwards up into the 80s those warnings from their own scientists grew more and more urgent,” Muffett, the November report’s co-author, told me. An internal Exxon memo from 1981 <A href=""https://www.nationalobserver.com/2015/11/06/news/exxon-under-investigation-ny-historic-<mark>climate</mark>-denial"" target=""_blank"">states that</A> <mark>carbon</mark> emissions could “produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic—at least for a substantial fraction of the earth’s population.” By then the company had calculated that reducing its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint would hurt revenues. Internally, the industry <A href=""http://graphics.latimes.com/oil-operations/"" target=""_blank"">began to protect itself</A> from <mark>climate change</mark>. Companies designed taller offshore oilrigs and pipelines able to withstand melting permafrost. “[They] had a responsibility to warn the public,” Muffett said. Instead, Exxon, BP, Chevron and Shell formed a group known as the Global <mark>Climate</mark> Coalition <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/science/earth/24deny.html"" target=""_blank"">that argued</A> <mark>climate</mark> science “is not well understood” into the 90s. </P><P>These are clear parallels to the cancer-denying days of big tobacco. But in recent years the comparison has become harder to make. Big oil now publicly admits the existence of <mark>climate change</mark>. “Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue that requires global engagement and action,” a Chevron spokesperson wrote to me. Berman must convince a court that earlier industry denial campaigns created lasting damage. Even with better science, questions of responsibility still loom. “In the case of global <mark>climate change</mark>, a molecule of <mark>carbon</mark> is literally around the world in seven days,” Scott Segal, an attorney who defends energy companies, <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/07/20/this-could-be-the-next-big-strategy-for-suing-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change/?utm_term=.4d86a9dd3d58"" target=""_blank"">told the </A><A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/07/20/this-could-be-the-next-big-strategy-for-suing-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change/?utm_term=.4d86a9dd3d58"" target=""_blank""><I> Washington Post</I></A> in July. “The requisite causation needed for nuisance suits is missing and unprovable.” </P><P>That’s how the law has traditionally viewed things. Yet a recent ruling in California against lead paint companies suggests the law’s view on causation is evolving. “This may not sound like it has anything to do with <mark>climate change</mark>,” Olszynski told me, “but it does.” For 17 years, three paint companies—ConAgra, NL Industries, and Sherwin-Williams—argued in court that the lead paint they manufactured couldn’t be linked to specific houses where people got sick. But last month the California Court of Appeals <A href=""http://beta.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-lead-paint-ruling-20171115-story.html"" target=""_blank"">ruled that</A> their marketing “implied lead paint was safe,” even though the companies knew it was not. “That’s a really important point,” Olszynski explained. It could mean there’s a stronger case that oil companies are legally responsible for sea-rise damage in San Francisco and Oakland. They marketed and sold a product that they knew is causing <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>You could make the same argument about the coal industry. Or carmakers such as General Motors. “If the oil company took the barrel of oil out of the ground but it was consumed in the car, how do you apportion liability?” Olszynski asked. But he thinks that the legal fight against tobacco companies provides a case study for how these types of challenges can be beaten. “Guys like Steve were like visionaries,” he argued. “That’s an important story because it talks about the speed to which the legal system can change.” </P><P>As far as Berman is concerned the story isn’t over. On <mark>climate change</mark> he thinks it’s just getting started. If a judge decides his case can be heard—a big <I> if</I>, considering that no lawsuit against big oil has made it to that stage—then Berman can call on Exxon, BP, Shell, ConocoPhillips and Chevron to make internal reports and research into <mark>climate change</mark> available. “[I’m] dying to get to those documents,” he said. “I’m convinced they’re going to be smoking hot.” </P><P>As our interview came to a close I asked Berman to describe the best-case scenario for all this. “Imagine if I could get ten or 15 cities to all sue and put the same pressure on the oil companies that we did with tobacco companies and create some kind of massive settlement,” he said. He acted as if it was the first time he’d thought of the idea. But I got the feeling it wasn’t.</P><P><I> Geoff Dembicki is the author of Are We Screwed?

While the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) is currently seeking public comment in connection with its Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative on whether it should “increase or reduce the environmental disclosure required” in Regulation S-K, it is unclear whether any sustainability-related disclosures will be mandated. In the absence of an SEC rule requiring sustainability disclosures, shareholders seeking to influence corporate action on sustainability reporting, as well as on <mark>climate change</mark> and other environmental issues, have increasingly turned to shareholder proposals in an effort to achieve their goals. These proposals have come in various forms; while some proposals seek increased disclosure, other proposals target companies’ corporate governance regime by requesting the nomination of directors with expertise in environmental matters or linking executive compensation with sustainability criteria.</P><P>Shareholder proposals pertaining to environmental issues have become increasingly prevalent over the past five years. As of June 30, 2016, 90 environment-related proposals had been submitted to a vote at Russell 3000 companies this year, compared to 84 proposals in 2015 and 58 proposals in 2014. Despite this steady increase, however, environmental proposals have been overwhelmingly unsuccessful. Of the 90 proposals that have been voted on so far this year, only one proposal (or 0.1%) passed, while 89 proposals (or 99.9%) failed. This outcome is consistent with voting results in previous years; over the past five years, only two out of a total of 324 environmental proposals that reached a vote at Russell 3000 companies (or 0.6%) have passed. Additionally, thus far this year, shareholder proposals submitted to a vote at Russell 3000 companies received average shareholder support of 21.9%. This result is in line with the average support of 19.9% and 20.1% garnered by environmental shareholder proposals in 2015 and 2014, respectively.</P><P>Nonetheless, these proposals appear to be getting more traction, as companies seem to be more inclined to negotiate with proponents as compared to previous years.</P><H1 id=""i.-positions-of-the-proxy-advisory-firms"">I.

Policies</H3><P>As a general matter, ISS recommends a vote case-by-case on proposals addressing social or environmental issues, with the “overall principle” guiding its vote recommendations focusing on “whether the implementation of the proposals is likely to enhance or protect shareholder value.” In reaching its vote recommendations on social or environmental proposals, ISS also considers several enumerated factors, namely:</P><UL><LI>whether “the issues presented in the proposal are more appropriately or effectively dealt with through legislation or government regulation”;</LI><LI>whether “the company has already responded in an appropriate and sufficient manner to the issue(s) raised in the proposal”;</LI><LI>whether the request in the proposal is “unduly burdensome” in its scope or timeframe or is “overly prescriptive”;</LI><LI>how the company’s approach compares to “any industry standard practices for addressing the issue(s) raised by the proposal”; and</LI><LI>in cases where the proposal requests “increased disclosure or greater transparency, whether or not reasonable and sufficient information” is available to the company’s shareholders and “whether or not implementation would reveal proprietary or confidential information that could place the company at a competitive disadvantage.”</LI></UL><P>ISS also has distinct voting policies on various specific environmental issues.

ISS recommends voting case-by-case on “proposals that establish or amend director qualifications,” considering “the reasonableness of the criteria and the degree to which they may preclude dissident nominees from joining the board.” ISS also recommends voting case-by-case on “resolutions seeking a director nominee who possesses a particular subject matter expertise, considering:</P><UL><LI>“the company’s board committee structure, existing subject matter expertise, and board nomination provisions relative to that of its peers;</LI><LI>the company’s existing board and management oversight mechanisms regarding the issue for which board oversight is sought;</LI><LI>the company’s disclosure and performance relating to the issue for which board oversight is sought and any significant related controversies;</LI><LI style=""list-style: none;"">and</LI><LI>the scope and structure of the proposal.”</LI></UL><P>In addition, ISS generally recommends voting against “proposals to establish a new board committee,” considering:</P><UL><LI>“existing oversight mechanisms,” “level of disclosure” and “company performance related to the issue for which board oversight is sought”;</LI><LI>“[b]oard committee structure compared to that of other companies in its industry sector; and</LI><LI>the scope and structure of the proposal.”</LI></UL><H4 id=""hydraulic-fracturing."">Hydraulic Fracturing.</H4><P>ISS generally recommends voting for proposals “requesting greater disclosure of a company’s (natural gas) hydraulic fracturing operations, including measures the company has taken to manage and mitigate the potential community and environmental impacts of those operations.” In determining its vote recommendation, ISS considers:</P><UL><LI>the company’s “current level of disclosure of relevant policies and oversight mechanisms” and how it compares to that of industry peers;</LI><LI>“potential relevant local, state, or national regulatory developments”;</LI><LI style=""list-style: none;"">and</LI><LI>“controversies, fines, or litigation related to the company’s hydraulic fracturing operations.”</LI></UL><H4 id=""recycling."">Recycling.</H4><P>ISS recommends voting case-by-case on “proposals to report on an existing recycling program, or adopt a new recycling program,” considering:</P><UL><LI>“the nature of the company’s business;</LI><LI>the current level of disclosure of the company’s existing related programs;</LI><LI>the timetable and methods of program implementation prescribed by the proposal;</LI><LI>the company’s ability to address the issues raised in the proposal; and</LI><LI>how the company’s recycling programs compare to similar programs of its industry peers.”</LI></UL><H3 id=""practice"">2.

Glass Lewis</H2><P>Glass Lewis’s proxy voting guidelines recognize that “day-to-day management and policy decisions, including those related to social, environmental or political issues, are best left to management and the board as they in almost all cases have more and better information about company strategy and risk.”</P><P>Glass Lewis will, however, favor “reasonable, well-crafted” shareholder proposals “when there is a clear link between the subject [of the proposal] and value enhancement or risk mitigation,” and, in Glass Lewis’s estimation, the company has not successfully addressed the issue. While discouraging the use of shareholder initiatives to “attempt to micromanage a company, its businesses or its executives,” Glass Lewis recognizes that, in some cases, these initiatives may serve to “protect shareholder value.”</P><P>Accordingly, Glass Lewis evaluates environment-related proposals “in the context of risk, on a case-by-case basis,” considering the following types of risk:</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Direct environmental and social risk,</STRONG> including “financial exposure to direct environmental risks associated with [the company’s] operations”;</LI><LI><STRONG>Risk due to legislation and regulation,</STRONG> i.e. “exposure to changes or potential changes in regulation that affect current and planned operations”;</LI><LI><STRONG>Legal and reputational risk,</STRONG> i.e., “the risk of damaging negative publicity and potentially costly legislation” resulting from “[f]ailure to take action on important environmental or social issues”; and</LI><LI><STRONG>Governance risk</STRONG>, i.e., the risk resulting from leadership that is ineffective or fails to thoroughly consider potential risks from environmental or social issues, which could ultimately lead to loss of shareholder value.</LI></UL><P>Glass Lewis also includes, in its proxy voting guidelines, policies regarding specific categories of environmental proposals. The most notable of these are discussed below.</P><H3 id=""<mark>climate</mark>-changeghg-emissions.""><mark>Climate Change</mark>/GHG Emissions.</H3><P>Glass Lewis considers recommending a vote in favor of “reasonably crafted proposals that request disclosure of a company’s <mark>climate change</mark> and/or [GHG] emission strategies” when:</P><UL><LI>the company “has suffered material financial impact from reputational damage, lawsuits or government investigations”;</LI><LI>“there is a strong link between <mark>climate change</mark> and its resultant regulation and shareholder value at the firm”;</LI><LI>the company “lags its peers regarding the requested disclosure or actions”; and/or</LI><LI>the company “has inadequately disclosed how it has addressed <mark>climate change</mark> risks.”</LI></UL><P>In addition, Glass Lewis considers supporting, on a case-by-case basis, “well-crafted proposals requesting that companies report their GHG emissions and adopt a reduction goal for these emissions[,] [p]articularly for companies operating in <mark>carbon</mark>- or energy-intensive industries.” In evaluating such proposals, Glass Lewis considers:</P><UL><LI>“the industry in which the company operates;</LI><LI>a lack of robust risk management of environmental issues as evidenced by material fines, lawsuits or reputational damage; and</LI><LI>whether a company’s peers have provided disclosure concerning their GHG emissions and future reduction goals.”</LI></UL><H3 id=""sustainability-and-environmentally-related-reports."">Sustainability and Environmentally-Related Reports.</H3><P>In its evaluation of proposals requesting that the company produce a sustainability or other “environmentally-related” report, Glass Lewis considers, among other factors:</P><UL><LI>the “financial risk to the company from its business operations”;</LI><LI>“the company’s current level of relevant disclosure;</LI><LI>the quality and comprehensiveness of sustainability information disclosed by the company’s peers;</LI><LI>the industry in which the company operates;</LI><LI>the company’s oversight of sustainability issues;</LI><LI>the level and type of sustainability concerns and controversies at the company;</LI><LI>the time frame within which the relevant report is to be produced; and</LI><LI>the level of flexibility granted to the board in implementing the proposal.”</LI></UL><P>Glass Lewis will consider recommending voting for “reasonably crafted proposals” requesting that companies “with significant exposure to sustainability-related risks,” such as those in extractive industries, produce “reports regarding the risks presented by their environmental and adverse effects on stakeholders that reduce shareholder value.” Glass Lewis will nonetheless evaluate these proposals, like all other environmental proposals, on a case-by-case basis.</P><H3 id=""renewable-energy.-1"">Renewable Energy.</H3><P>When evaluating “proposals requesting an action or disclosure related to renewable energy or energy efficiency,” Glass Lewis will take into account:</P><UL><LI>“current energy regulations facing the company and their attendant risks to its operations; o the company’s responsiveness to issues related to energy efficiency and renewable energy; o the company’s current disclosure on this issue; and</LI><LI>whether the company’s actions and disclosure are aligned with that of its peers.”</LI></UL><P>Glass Lewis may consider recommending a vote in favor of “well-crafted” proposals that seek “increased disclosure of renewable energy strategies or efforts toward increased energy efficiency,” where:</P><UL><LI>“there is credible evidence of egregious or illegal behavior regarding the company’s energy strategy or actions in this regard;</LI><LI>the company has been largely unresponsive to shifting regulatory changes related to energy policies; or</LI><LI>adoption of the requested disclosure will clearly lead to an increase in or the protection of shareholder value.”</LI></UL><P>Glass Lewis, however, is “not inclined to support proposals requesting the adoption of renewable energy goals or proposals seeking the implementation of prescriptive policies related to energy efficiency or renewable energy.”</P><H3 id=""executive-compensation."">Executive Compensation.</H3><P>With regard to proposals that request tying executive compensation to environmental or social practices, Glass Lewis will:</P><UL><LI>“review the target firm’s compliance with (or contravention of) applicable laws and regulations”;</LI><LI>“examine any history of environmentally and socially related concerns, including those resulting in material investigations, lawsuits, fines and settlements”; and</LI><LI>“review the firm’s current compensation policies and practices.”</LI></UL><P>As a general matter, however, Glass Lewis believes that “the selection of performance metric for executive compensation … should be left to the compensation committee.”</P><H1 id=""ii.-positions-of-large-institutional-shareholders"">II. Positions of Large Institutional Shareholders</H1><P>Large institutional shareholders have not uniformly provided explicit guidance as to their voting policies on environment-related proposals. The voting guidelines of Fidelity, Vanguard and BlackRock, for example, do not reference environmental proposals. Additionally, institutional investors’ policies on environmental proposals are usually broad in scope and do not necessarily address how a specific proposal will be evaluated. Because environmental proposals tend to be specific, it can be difficult to discern how these institutional investors will respond to any given proposal. State Street Global Advisors, for example, addresses environmental proposals in its voting guidelines, indicating that it is chiefly concerned the financial and economic implications of environmental issues. According to its voting principles, State Street “encourages companies to be transparent about the environmental and social risks and opportunities they face and adopt robust policies and processes to manage such issues.” State Street evaluates shareholder proposals related to environmental and social risks on an issuer by issuer basis, with the understanding that “environmental and social risks can vary widely depending on a company, its industry, operations, and geographic footprint.”</P><H1 id=""iii.-environmental-proposals-trends"">III.

A total of 11 requests were granted and 13 were denied on substantive grounds. The no-action requests granted on substantive grounds were decided based on one of the following exclusionary rules:</P><UL><LI>Rule 14a-8(i)(1)—The proposal is not a proper subject for action by shareholders under the laws of the jurisdiction of the company’s organization (one no-action letter granted).</LI><LI>Rule 14a-8(i)(7)—The proposal relates to the company’s ordinary business operations (seven no-action letters granted).</LI><LI>Rule 14a-8(i)(10)—The company has already substantially implemented the proposal (one no-action letter granted).</LI><LI>Rule 14a-8(i)(12)—The proposal is substantially similar to a proposal submitted in prior years which did not receive sufficient shareholder support for resubmission (two no-action letters granted).</LI></UL><P>In 2014, Glass Lewis recommended a vote against the proposal, explaining, among other things, that although it “would like to see more specific disclosure regarding the Company’s sustainability initiatives,” it “[did] not believe that proponent ha[d] sufficiently demonstrated that the Company’s current practices [at the time] present[ed] a threat to shareholder value.” Furthermore, the Company did not have any “recent high-profile environmental and social controversies,” and it relatively “align[ed] with its peers regarding disclosure.” Glass Lewis repeated its recommendation in 2015, noting that though a similar proposal received “significant shareholder support” of 40% in 2014, it was still “not convinced that adoption of this proposal [was] necessary at [the] time or that shareholders would derive significant benefit from the production of the requested report.” In 2016, however, Glass Lewis recommended a vote in favor of the proposal because “it would signal responsiveness to shareholders” and “would be in the best long-term interest of the Company and its shareholders.” In addition to noting that “there is room for improvement” in the company’s current disclosure, Glass Lewis explained that although 40% and 45.2% of shareholders supported this proposal in 2014 and 2015, respectively, “the Company made no meaningful improvements to its report or disclosure over the last year.” Glass Lewis expressed concern that this might “indicate a level of unresponsiveness to shareholder concerns.”</P><H2 id=""a.-improper-under-state-law-under-rule-14a-8i1-nextera-energy"">A. Improper Under State Law under Rule 14a-8(i)(1): NextEra Energy</H2><P>During the 2016 proxy season, one company submitted a no-action request to the SEC arguing that the shareholder proposal it had received was not a proper subject for action by shareholders under state law. The shareholder proposal at issue, which was submitted to NextEra Energy, Inc., requested that the company “report material risks and costs of sea level rise to company operations, facilities, and markets based on a range of [sea level rise] scenarios projecting forward to 2100, according to best available science.” In its no-action request, NextEra argued that the proposal was not a proper subject for action by shareholders under Florida law because the proposal “is not cast as a recommendation or request but as a mandatory proposal that would be binding upon the Company if approved,” in contravention of the discretionary power of the board under state law. The Staff concurred but noted that “this defect could be cured … if the proposal were recast as a recommendation or request to the board of directors.” Accordingly, the Staff concluded that it would not recommend enforcement action unless the proponent revised the proposal within seven days.</P><H2 id=""b.-ordinary-business-operations-under-rule-14a-8i7-general-electric-ball-corporation-dunkin-brands-group-amazon.com-the-tjx-companies-cvs-health-corporation-and-duke-energy-corporation"">B. Ordinary Business Operations under Rule 14a-8(i)(7): General Electric, Ball Corporation, Dunkin’ Brands Group, Amazon.com, The TJX Companies, CVS Health Corporation and Duke Energy Corporation</H2><P>By far, the most popular ground on which issuers requested no-action relief from the Staff with regard to environmental proposals this year was Rule 14a-8(i)(7), which permits the exclusion of shareholder proposals that deal with “a matter relating to the company’s ordinary business operations.” Fifteen companies faced with environmental shareholder proposals submitted seventeen no-action requests to the SEC on this basis, seven of which were successful. Notably, the Staff appears to consider <mark>climate change</mark> and GHG emissions to be “significant policy issues,” thereby precluding no-action relief under Rule 14a-8(i)(7) for proposals relating to GHG emissions or requesting <mark>climate change</mark> reports or action.</P><P>Accordingly, the Staff did not grant no-action relief this year with regard to any such proposals under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</P><H3 id=""general-electric-company-ge."">General Electric Company (GE).</H3><P>GE received a shareholder proposal requesting that the company “undertake an independent evaluation and prepare an independent report by October 2016, demonstrating that the company has assessed all potential sources of liability related to [Polychlorinated Biphenyl] discharges in the Hudson River … and offering conclusions on the most responsible and cost-effective way to address them.” In its no-action request, GE asserted that this proposal relates to the company’s ordinary business operations because it would substitute the board’s judgment with that of the shareholders on decisions involving litigation strategy with regard to an ongoing litigation and because it interferes with the company’s legal compliance program by putting shareholders in a position to evaluate its effectiveness. The SEC granted no-action relief, specifically noting that the proposal would “affect the conduct of ongoing litigation to which the company is a party.”</P><H3 id=""ball-corporation."">Ball Corporation.</H3><P>The shareholder proposal submitted to Ball Corporation requested that the company “issue a report (by October 2016, at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information) reviewing the Company’s policies, actions, and plans to reduce [bisphenol-A (‘BPA’)] use in its products and set quantitative targets to phase out the use of BPA, in light of reputational and regulatory risks.” In its request for no-action relief, Ball Corporation argued that this proposal deals with matters relating to the company’s ordinary business operations because it “seeks to influence the Company’s development, manufacture and sale of its packaging products, which comprise the core of the Company’s packaging business.” The SEC concurred, noting that the proposal “relates to Ball’s product development.”</P><H3 id=""dunkin-brands-group-inc."">Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc.</H3><P>The shareholder proposal received by Dunkin’ Brands requested that the company “issue a public report describing the company’s short- and long-term strategies on water use management specifically related to toilets in the retail facilities.” In its no-action request, Dunkin’ argued that this proposal is excludable pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(7), among other exclusionary provisions. The company asserted that the proposal would involve a “direct interjection into the Company’s relationship with its customers, the franchisees, which is a crucial component of [its] day-to-day business operations.” The company took the position that the proposal seeks to micro-manage this relationship and, in particular, the company’s ongoing efforts to “assist its franchisees in building more <mark>sustainable</mark> restaurants” through the DD Green Achievement Program, a certification program for franchisees. Furthermore, the company claimed that the proposal “focuses on the specific issue of water consumption by toilets, which is not a significant policy issue that transcends the company’s day-to-day business operations.” The Staff granted no-action relief pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</P><H3 id=""amazon.com-inc."">Amazon.com, Inc.</H3><P>Amazon received a shareholder proposal seeking a report “on the company’s policy options to reduce potential <mark>pollution</mark> and public health problems from electronic waste generated as a result of its sales to consumers, and to increase the safe recycling of such wastes.” The company argued that this proposal is excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(7) because it requests that Amazon.com “offer a specific service (to assist in recycling customers’ discarded electronics” and that it “revise its policies regarding products it sells.” The company further asserted that the proposal “relates to [its] customer relations efforts.” The Staff concurred that “the proposal relates to the company’s products and services and does not focus on a significant policy issue.”</P><H3 id=""the-tjx-companies-and-cvs-health-corporation."">The TJX Companies and CVS Health Corporation.</H3><P>The proposals received by The TJX Companies and CVS Health Corporation requested that senior management “set company-wide quantitative targets by November 2016 to increase renewable energy sourcing and/or production.”</P><P>The TJX Companies argued that the proposal is excludable because it “concerns the Company’s management of energy expenses” and establishes a deadline of five months, which is “unjustifiably short, arbitrary and inappropriately seeks to dictate the allocation of the Company’s human and financial resources.” Similarly, CVS maintained that the proposal relates to its ordinary business operations by: “(1) focusing on cost-saving measures and the day-to-day financial management of the Company and (2) micro-managing (a) the deadline … and (b) the manner in which the Company chooses to pursue … environmentally-friendly initiatives.” In both cases, the Staff agreed that the proposal may properly be excluded under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</P><H3 id=""duke-energy-corporation."">Duke Energy Corporation.</H3><P>The proposal submitted to Duke Energy requested that “a committee of the Board of Directors oversee a study of the potential future impact of changes in the electric utility industry, and prepare a report on how to meet these challenges and protect shareholder value” by September 2016. The company argued that the proposal concerns its ordinary business decisions of products and services offered, since it focuses on Duke’s “consideration of which alternative energy sources to offer” and “choice of technologies,” therefore attempting to impermissibly micro-manage its business. The Staff granted no-action relief pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</P><H2 id=""c.-substantial-implementation-under-rule-14a-8i10-dominion-resources"">C. Substantial Implementation under Rule 14a-8(i)(10): Dominion Resources</H2><P>Eight companies sought to exclude ten environmental shareholder proposals this year pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(10), which permits the exclusion of a proposal if the company had already substantially implemented it. Only one such company, Dominion Resources, Inc., was successful.</P><P>The proposal received by Dominion Resources requested that the company’s board publish a report on how the company is “measuring, mitigating, setting reduction targets, and disclosing methane emissions.” In its no-action request, Dominion Resources took the position that it had substantially implemented the proposal through its publicly available <EM>Methane Management Report 2015</EM>, which describes the company’s practices related to methane emissions and thus “compares favorably with the guidelines in the Proposal.” The company further asserted that, in addition to mandatory disclosures, it makes various voluntary disclosures that address its GHG emissions, including in its 2014 Greenhouse Gas Report. The SEC agreed that the company’s actions “compare favorably with the guidelines of the proposal” and thus granted no-action relief under Rule 14a-8(i)(10).</P><H2 id=""d.-resubmission-under-rule-14a-8i12-wal-mart-stores-inc.-and-chevron-corporation"">D. Resubmission under Rule 14a-8(i)(12): Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and <mark>Chevron Corpo</mark>ration</H2><P>During the 2016 proxy season, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and <mark>Chevron Corpo</mark>ration requested three no-action letters on the ground that an environmental shareholder proposal they had received was substantially similar to a previous shareholder proposal that was submitted to a vote at the company but did not receive the requisite shareholder support for resubmission under Rule 14a-8(i)(12). Two of these requests were successful.</P><P>The shareholder proposal submitted to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. urged the company to “set quantitative goals, based on current technologies, for reducing total greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions produced by the international marine shipping of products sold in Walmart’s stores and clubs” and “to report to shareholders by December 31, 2016 … regarding the goals and steps Walmart plans to take to achieve them.” In its no-action request, Wal-Mart explained that the proposal was nearly identical to a proposal that was included in its 2015 proxy materials. The company indicated that the proposal submitted to a vote in 2015 received a mere 1.75% of the vote. Accordingly, the company asserted, the proposal “did not receive the support necessary for resubmission” under rule 14a-8(i)(12)(i), which permits exclusion where the proposal deals with substantially the same subject as another proposal in the preceding five years and received less than 3% of the vote. Concurring that the 2015 proposal “deal[t] with substantially the same subject matter,” and the Staff granted the company no-action relief.</P><P><mark>Chevron Corpo</mark>ration similarly requested no-action relief under Rule 14a-8(i)(12), though under a separate provision thereof, which permits the exclusion of a proposal dealing with substantially the same subject matter as a proposal that received “[l]ess than 10% of the vote on its last submission to shareholders if proposed three times or more previously within the preceding 5 calendar years.” The proposal submitted to <mark>Chevron Corpo</mark>ration in 2016 requested that the company prepare a report that includes:</P><P>“a) The numbers of all offshore oil wells… that <mark>Chevron Corpo</mark>ration owns or has a partnership in
b) Current and projected expenditures for remedial maintenance and inspection of out-of-production wells
c) Cost of research to find effective containment and reclamation following marine oil spills.”</P><P>Chevron argued that this proposal deals with “substantially the same subject matter” as at least three previous shareholder proposals submitted to a vote at the company in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and that, on its last submission, the proposal “did not receive the support necessary for resubmission.” Given that the previously submitted proposals were virtually identical, the Staff found that “proposals dealing with substantially the same subject matter were included in Chevron’s proxy materials for meetings held in 2013, 2012 and 2011.” Indicating that “the 2013 proposal received only 7.25 percent” support during its last submission to shareholders in 2013, the Staff concurred that Chevron may exclude the proposal under Rule 14a-8(i)(12)(iii).</P><H1 id=""v.-takeaways"">V. Takeaways</H1><P>Although environmental shareholder proposals are increasingly prevalent, they are rarely successful. If faced with a shareholder proposal related to <mark>climate change</mark>, sustainability or other environmental issues, management should consider whether it is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders to attempt to negotiate exclusion of the proposal through the substantial implementation of the proposal’s request or to submit the proposal to a shareholder vote. If management determines not to negotiate with the proponent (or if negotiations are unsuccessful), and if no-action relief is either unlikely to be granted or is denied, management should bear in mind that proposals of this nature are unlikely to receive majority support.</P><P>The complete publication, including footnotes, is available <A href=""http://www.stblaw.com/docs/default-source/memos/firmmemo_08_08_16_environmental-proposals.pdf"" target=""_blank"" class=""external"" rel=""nofollow"">here</A>.</P><DIV class=""hatom-extra"" style=""display:none;visibility:hidden;""><SPAN class=""entry-title""><mark>Climate Change</mark>, Sustainability and Other Environmental Proposals</SPAN><SPAN class=""published""> 2016-09-06T09:52:37-04:00</SPAN><SPAN class=""updated""> 2016-09-06T09:52:37-04:00</SPAN><SPAN class=""author vcard""><SPAN class=""fn"">Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation</SPAN></SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

				Waves crash against a seawall along the Embarcadero in San Francisco in 2010.									<P class=""credits"">Eric Risberg / AP</P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class=""entry-content single-post-content""><P>SAN FRANCISCO — Outside a courtroom where a much-anticipated court hearing on <mark>climate</mark> science took place on Wednesday is an old photo of San Francisco’s coastline. Dated 1865, it features an area of the city known as North Beach, which back then was covered in ramshackle wooden houses on a sandy slope nuzzled up against the shore. Since then, the coastline has been extended, filled in with sand (<A href=""https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/making-up-ground/"">and most likely boats and other strange things</A>) to stretch several blocks farther into the brackish waters of the San Francisco Bay. A sea wall, <A href=""http://abc7news.com/politics/san-franciscos-cracking-seawall-needs-$250m-makeover/3235921/"">badly in need of repair</A>, keeps the bay at bay.</P><P>That very sea wall is at the heart of the court case — The People of the State of California v. BP P.L.C. et al. — that was the reason for Wednesday’s spectacle. The cities of Oakland and San Francisco are suing the five biggest fossil fuel companies on the planet — BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell — for <A href=""http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/environment/article206025399.html"">billions of dollars</A> for past damages and to prevent future flooding from sea level rise. Since the companies extracted fuel that altered the planet, the argument goes, they should pay for the consequences. It’s a modern version of “you break it, you buy it.” The oil companies have filed to dismiss the lawsuit on many grounds, including that it’s the government’s job to set and enforce <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels — not theirs.</P><P>On Wednesday, no one was yet on trial. <A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber"">U.S. District Judge William Alsup</A> made that very clear to the throng of spectators who filled the chambers, a spillover courtroom and the halls outside. Instead, we were there to see a tutorial, an effort to help this self-described “poor judge” learn the science behind the case. It was going to be a boring morning full of numbers and diagrams, he warned the audience.</P><P>But in this polarized moment, a public tussling over the basics of <mark>climate</mark> science, however cursory, is anything but boring. And as each side in the case presented a history of <mark>climate change</mark> science, it was striking just how much the two sides agreed on: <mark>Climate change</mark> is happening, and humans are in large part responsible. But that’s not really what this court case is about. Rather, it’s about who knew what and when, how much uncertainty there is around future predictions and who should be held responsible (and liable) for a future with higher seas and more extreme weather events. That’s where the cities’ and corporations’ use of evidence diverged.</P><P>First up: the scientists.</P><P>At a big rectangular table in the center of the room, the cities were represented by Steve Berman, a lawyer known for his ability to <A href=""https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43qw3j/meet-the-lawyer-trying-to-make-big-oil-pay-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">get big settlements out of big corporations</A>, as well as some of their own lawyers. But aside from a few introductory remarks, Berman left the talking to a few of the world’s leading experts on <mark>climate change</mark>. First, he called Myles Allen, who is a professor of geosystem science at Oxford University and was tasked with providing a historiography of <mark>climate change</mark> research.</P><P>In true scientist fashion, the talk was filled with jargon and complicated scientific concepts. Alsup, who made clear that he would call out confusing charts or unclear explanations, asked Allen what made <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, which is emitted from burning fossil fuels and have led to a warming planet, special. Allen, equal to the task, began to pantomime his answer. Arms stretched out to the side, fists in a ball, he shimmied left and right, showing how the charge on a <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide molecule could be unevenly distributed, absorbing the infrared waves that are naturally emitted from Earth, unlike oxygen and nitrogen, whose charge is symmetric. That infrared gets trapped within Earth’s atmosphere, instead of escaping, causing the planet to warm.</P><P>After walking through key figures and research from the last century of <mark>climate</mark> science, Allen concluded by saying that we’ve known that the planet was warming since the 1970s. And crucially, he said, we knew back then that we might not know how bad <mark>climate change</mark> would be, or be able to feel and see the effects of that warming, until it was already too late.</P><P>The next speaker, Gary Griggs, an oceanographer who works at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was deep into an explanation of sea level rise when a loud, piercing alarm went off. “Coastal flood alert,” Alsup quipped as soon as it finished. The room broke out in laughter. It wasn’t clear whether it was real or a drill, but nature has a way of making itself known.</P><P>Next up: the lawyers.</P><P>While the cities relied on scientists, the energy companies relied on lawyers. One in particular: Theodore Boutrous, a lawyer for Chevron (which is headquartered in the Bay Area) did all of the talking. And he got straight to the point, answering the question on everyone’s mind: Yes, Chevron accepts the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>. And in honor of that consensus, he’d be relying almost entirely on the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, a United Nations-backed consortium meant to provide a scientific view of what <mark>climate change</mark> is doing to the planet, to lay out his understanding of the science and the history.</P><P>He kicked off by quoting from the IPCC’s <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/"">most recent report</A>, from 2013, citing population growth and economic changes as the most important drivers of <mark>climate change</mark>. The report, he noted, says nothing about fossil-fuel extraction as a driver of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Boutrous offered a history lesson that had a lot in common with Allen’s, but with a much greater focus on the uncertainty around both the science and the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on the Bay Area. He illustrated that uncertainty in various ways, describing how theories that posited alternative roles of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere held sway through at least the 1950s. Boutros also showed how actual temperatures hadn’t been as extreme as many <mark>climate</mark> forecasts predicted in the years leading up to the report. Alsup asked if his point was that the models exaggerated the impact of humans on the <mark>climate</mark>. “Instead of doom and gloom, it’s just gloom?” he asked the lawyer. Boutrous chuckled and moved on.</P><P>Boutrous concluded by showing a map of sea level rise, saying that sea levels had fallen around San Francisco in the years leading up to the 2013 IPCC report. There’s a lot of uncertainty about the future, he concluded, noting that San Francisco and Oakland had reported that <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-municipalities-debt-disclosures-contrast-with-<mark>climate</mark>-warnings-1515456551"">exact message to bond investors</A> in 2017, when the cities said they couldn’t predict whether major flooding or storms might have a major, adverse impact on the local economy.</P><P>Finally, the tutorial pivoted back to the cities, so it pivoted back to the scientists. Don Wuebbles, who is a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois and co-wrote the 2007 IPCC report that helped the organization win the Nobel Peace Prize, was the final scientist called by the cities. He began by pointing out that he’d also led the writing of the first chapter in the 2013 IPCC report that Boutrous had so carefully recounted. “I think it’s important to recognize that science did not stop; there’s a lot we’ve learned in the last five years,” Wuebbles said. That’s why he’d be using <A href=""https://science2017.globalchange.gov/"">data from the U.S. Global Change Research Program</A>, which produces more frequent, national reports on <mark>climate change</mark> to make his presentation.</P><P>The year after the most recent IPCC report was published was the hottest on record, Wuebbles told the court. Then 2015 topped 2014, and 2016 topped 2015. Temperatures are going up, precipitation is increasing, extreme events are more frequent. Looking at a broader set of years, sea level has risen around the San Francisco Bay. Alsup asked Wuebbles whether he disagreed with Boutrous’s recounting of the science.</P><P>Not really, since the lawyer had based his presentation on the IPCC, and a report that Wuebbles was heavily involved with. But Wuebbles’s point was that the IPCC report doesn’t tell all of what we know in 2018. The IPCC report might not be wrong, but that doesn’t mean that it gives the best picture of what’s right.</P><P>As the tutorial concluded, Alsup had a few final remarks. “I wore my science tie today,” he said, pointing to the solar system hanging around his neck before standing up to leave. “I hope someone takes note of that.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV class=""mini-bio""><P>Anna Maria Barry-Jester reports on public health, food and culture for FiveThirtyEight.  <SPAN class=""twitter""><A href=""https://twitter.com/annabarryjester"" target=""_blank""><SPAN class=""twitter-username"">@annabarryjester</SPAN></A></SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class=""tags""><P class=""filed-under"">Filed under</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

	Big Oil majors BP plc, <mark>Chevron Corp.</mark>, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell plc are being sued by San Francisco and Oakland to force the operators to pay for the cost of protecting Northern California from rising sea levels and the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>
	The separate lawsuits, which do not seek specific financial compensation, were filed Tuesday in state court in San Francisco and Alameda counties. San Francisco’s lawsuit projected that long-term improvements to the city’s seawall would cost an estimated $5 billion.</P><P>“These fossil fuel companies profited handsomely for decades while knowing they were putting the fate of our cities at risk,” said San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera. “Instead of owning up to it, they copied a page from the Big Tobacco playbook. They launched a multi-million dollar disinformation campaign to deny and discredit what was clear even to their own scientists: global warming is real, and their product is a huge part of the problem.”</P><P>
	Oakland City Attorney Barbara J. Parker, whose city sits across from San Francisco on the East Bay, said the laws were “clear that the defendants are responsible for the consequences of their reckless and disastrous actions. The harm to our cities has commenced and will only get worse.”</P><P>
	The attorneys cited documents they claim show that the producers knew about the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> caused by fossil fuel emissions but chose to sow doubts publicly about it.</P><P>
	Chevron, headquartered in Northern California in San Ramon, said the litigation would not help address <mark>climate change</mark>.
	A spokesman for Chevron, Melissa Ritchie, said the lawsuits would not help address <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue that requires global engagement and action,&quot; Chevron spokeswoman Melissa Ritchie said. &quot;Should this litigation proceed, it will only serve special interests at the expense of broader policy, regulatory, and economic priorities.&quot;</P><P>
	Chevron welcomes opportunities to fight <mark>climate change</mark>, but the lawsuits are not constructive, it said.</P><P>“Chevron welcomes serious attempts to address the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>, but these suits do not do that,” the company stated. &quot;Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue that requires global engagement and action. Should this litigation proceed, it will only serve special interests at the expense of broader policy, regulatory and economic priorities.”</P><P>
	ExxonMobil, which is in the midst of a <A href=""http://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/111724-exxonmobil-loses-bid-in-fraud-lawsuit-to-keep-auditor-records-private"">federal lawsuit and related litigation</A> initially spearheaded by New York’s attorney general about how its operations may impact <mark>climate change</mark>, called into question the validity of the California lawsuits.</P><P>“The claims in these lawsuits are without merit,” said an ExxonMobil spokesman. “We will vigorously defend ourselves against them.”</P><P>
	The plaintiffs in these lawsuits “may have overplayed their hand by moving their fight against <mark>climate change</mark> from the court of public opinion to a court of law,” said attorney Nicholas S. Preservati of Spilman Thomas &amp; Battle in Charleston, WV. “The plaintiffs must now actually substantiate their claims that manmade <mark>carbon</mark> emissions are the root cause of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“Contrary to the allegations in the lawsuit, sea levels are lower now than they were in September 2015 according to NASA,” he said. “In addition, the plaintiffs will have a difficult time proving damages from rising sea levels, since NASA records show less than a 3.5-inch increase in sea levels over the past 25 years.”</P><P>
	In addition, the plaintiffs may have to prove “the Arctic ice melt is the result of manmade <mark>carbon</mark> emissions instead of the 1,100 mile string of volcanoes (Gakkel Ridge) that are releasing heat and methane beneath the Arctic Ocean,” Preservati said. “While there are many hurdles facing the plaintiffs, this lawsuit may ultimately fall under its own weight as the plaintiffs should be required to join all emitters of <mark>carbon</mark> as indispensable parties.”</P><P>
	A related case is underway against ExxonMobil. In a <A href=""http://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/107933-exxonmobil-failed-to-prepare-massachusetts-terminal-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change-impact-lawsuit-claims"">first of its kind lawsuit</A> filed against the company last year, Judge Mark L. Wolf of the U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, earlier this month dismissed in part claims by the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) concerning <mark>climate change</mark> impacts.</P><P>
	CLF’s lawsuit asserts several things, including that ExxonMobil’s Everett oil transfer and storage facility in Boston Harbor has failed to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit and the U.S. Clean Water Act. The lawsuit also claims the marine terminal has not been sufficiently upgraded to handle <mark>climate change</mark> impacts. The lawsuit is <EM>Conservation Law Foundation v. ExxonMobil</EM>, No. CV-16:11950.</P><P>
	Wolf allowed the lawsuit to continue, but CLF was ordered to remove the <mark>climate change</mark> references. The judge wrote that he wanted to avoid the “Scopes Monkey Trial of the 21st Century,” referring to the famous 1925 trial about whether evolution should be taught in Tennessee schools. The trial devolved into a debate about human origin.</P><P>
	References have to stripped out regarding harm caused by <mark>climate change</mark> that would occur in 2050 or later. Material to the case is whether there is a foreseeable risk of substantial change in sea level, Wolf said. However, it is not important whether the cause of the sea level change is because of “warming of the atmosphere or a Noah’s Ark phenomenon.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""likes social-networking""><A href=""https://twitter.com/share"" class=""twitter-share-button"" data-lang=""en"" data-size=""medium"">Tweet</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""box3 article author-biography""><DIV class=""article-author-bio""><DIV class=""records""><DIV class=""record""><DIV class=""author_bio noimage""><DIV style=""width:575px;height:auto;margin:0 auto;""><DIV style=""width:100%;height:auto;padding:0 0 0 0;margin:0 auto;""><P style=""font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:16px;""><B>Managing Editor</B> | <B>Houston, TX</B><SPAN style=""font-family:Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-size:11pt;"">Carolyn Davis joined the editorial staff of Intelligence Press Inc. in Houston in May, 2000.

The first piece is a leaked list of official talking points EPA officials are expected to promote on the subject of <mark>climate change</mark>. The second is a kind of surprising admission from a Chevron attorney in court that <mark>climate change</mark> is not only real, but that it’s caused by man and requires serious intervention.</P><P>Starting on the political side, it appears that EPA staffers have been unsure how they are expected to answer questions about <mark>climate change</mark> given that the current administration has such radically different views on the science compared to previous leadership.</P><P>To guide staffers, the EPA’s Office of Public Affairs sent out some talking points they can use, which leaked to the <A href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/epa-<mark>climate</mark>-adaptation_us_5abbb5e3e4b04a59a31387d7?ux"" target=""_blank"">Huffington Post</A>. Included on that list are statements such as:</P><UL><LI>“While there has been extensive research and a host of published reports on <mark>climate change</mark>, clear gaps remain, including our understanding of the role of human activity and what we can do about it.”</LI><LI>“The ability to measure with precision the degree and extent of [human] impact and what to do about it are subject to continuing debate and dialogue.”</LI></UL><P>These statements mirror EPA director Scott Pruitt’s overall strategy of portraying <mark>climate change</mark> as an ongoing debate where the science isn’t settled, even though the scientific community is abundantly clear where it stands on this critical environmental issue. Essentially, the EPA is being instructed to shrug at <mark>climate change</mark> rather than address it.</P><P>Meanwhile, in court last week, five of the world’s largest oil companies were dragged into federal court to explain their role in our <mark>climate change</mark> crisis. Oil companies have traditionally denied or downplayed global warming, but <A href=""https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/3/28/17152804/<mark>climate</mark>-change-federal-court-chevron"" target=""_blank"">Chevron’s lawyer took a refreshingly different route</A>.</P><P>“Chevron accepts the consensus in the scientific communities on <mark>climate change</mark>,” Theodore Boutrous, a legal representative of Chevron, said. “There’s no debate about <mark>climate change</mark>.” He also acknowledged “it’s an issue for policymakers to address.”</P><P>Let’s be clear that Boutrous was careful not to seriously throw his client under the bus. He argued that Chevron had previously been resistant to <mark>climate</mark> alarmism because the science was not nearly as strong as it currently is. He also portrayed the oil giant as a “symptom” of booming industrialization and should not shoulder the blame for the environmental destruction because the entire world participates in this system.</P><P>Nevertheless, it’s clear that we live in a time where even a company like Chevron realizes that there’s no longer a benefit to questioning <mark>climate</mark> science. The fact that even the damned EPA can’t get on board with that messaging is distressing. Who are they protecting if not the oil companies?</P><P>In a fictional universe, this situation might seem comical, but the consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> are very much an ongoing threat for all inhabitants on this planet. At a point where we either need to take serious or concede defeat, we don’t have time to carefully equivocate with nonsense, anti-science talking points.</P><P>I never thought I’d say this, but why can’t the EPA be more like Chevron?</P><P><I>Photo credit: Thinkstock</I></P></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV id=""in_article""><DIV id=""wp_newsletter"" class=""blog-newsletter""><DIV class=""not_subscribed blog-not-subscribed"" style=""display:none""><P>Get fact-based insights about newsworthy causes delivered daily to your inbox.</P></DIV><DIV class=""already_subscribed blog-subscribed"" style=""display:none;""><H3>Thanks for subscribing!</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

These subpoenas seek documents related to Exxon's internal understanding of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and <mark>climate change</mark>, and any alleged efforts Exxon took to promote contradictory studies and information with the purpose of misleading the public.</P><P>One common thread to the various <mark>climate change</mark> investigations and litigations over the last few years is that they are being pursued in &quot;blue states&quot; such as California, New York and Massachusetts, at the same time that President Trump and the Republican controlled Congress have taken, or explored taking, various steps to roll-back <mark>climate change</mark> initiatives championed by the Obama Administration. These federal rollbacks include President Trump's stated intention to withdraw US participation from the Paris Agreement, the current EPA decision to review (and possibly scale back) the enforcement of the Clean Air Act as it relates to certain <mark>climate change</mark> issues, and a general lack of enthusiasm by federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, to pursue litigation or more aggressive regulation relating to the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><H3>Will these recent California tort claims succeed or fail?</H3><P>In our view, they will fail and fail early on at the motion to dismiss stage of the litigation. In fact, no US lawsuit asserting nuisance or other tort claims predicated on <mark>climate change</mark> theories of liability and entitlement to remedial relief has proceeded beyond the motion to dismiss phase, and there is little reason to think that <EM>Oakland/San Francisco</EM> and the <EM>San Mateo</EM> complaints will fare any better. The <EM>San Mateo</EM> defendants have removed the complaint to federal court, where they will move to dismiss; the defendants in the <EM>Oakland/San Francisco </EM>litigations will likely do the same. The defendants in these cases will be able to assert a number of compelling defenses, which we generally describe and identify below. In our view, the following defenses, alone or in tandem, likely will prove fatal to these California claims.</P><H4>Lack of standing</H4><P>As a prerequisite to asserting a cause of action in federal court, a plaintiff must show that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury, that this injury is fairly traceable to the defendant's alleged conduct, and that the injury can be redressed by a favorable decision by the court. Several prior attempts seeking to hold fossil fuel companies liable for the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> have foundered on this ground. For example, in <EM>Washington Environmental Council v. Bellon</EM>, 732 F.3d 1131 (9th Cir. 2013) (&quot;<EM>Bellon</EM>&quot;), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring suit to compel a state agency to regulate the emissions linked to five oil refineries. The court held that there was an insufficient causal nexus between the defendants' emissions and any injuries that might occur in Washington state as a result of <mark>climate change</mark>. Similarly, the same court held in <EM>Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil</EM>, 696 F.3d 849 (9th Cir. 2012) (&quot;<EM>Kivalina</EM>&quot;), that the plaintiffs – natives of a coastal town in Alaska that was allegedly facing higher risk of storm damage as a result of <mark>climate change</mark> – lacked standing to bring a nuisance suit arising from Exxon's <mark>carbon</mark> emissions because <mark>climate change</mark> has been going on for at least decades and is caused by <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from a multitude of sources. In other words, because <mark>climate change</mark> is a sprawling phenomenon with multiple potential causes and effects, in order to prove standing a plaintiff needs to allege concrete and particularized injuries that directly flow from a particular defendant or defendants' alleged tortious conduct and emissions. Without such a causal nexus, plaintiffs lack standing to pursue <mark>climate change</mark> claims.</P><P>Courts have also dismissed claims for lack of standing on the grounds that the alleged injuries (which can include prospective or anticipated rises in sea levels and storm intensity as is being alleged in the recent California filings) are not sufficiently concrete and particularized. In <EM>Kivalina</EM>, for example, the court held that the plaintiff's claimed injuries (allegedly caused by rising sea levels) could not support standing because they were not bounded in time and not linked to any specific conduct by the defendant in the litigation.</P><P>Other federal courts have also held that plaintiffs do not have standing to assert claims against fossil fuel companies on the basis of future injuries that may be caused by <mark>climate change</mark>. In <EM>Conservation Law Foundation v. ExxonMobil</EM>, No. 16-11950-MLW (D. Mass.), an enforcement suit under the Clean Water Act and Solid Waste Disposal Act, a trial court in the District of Massachusetts recently held that while the plaintiffs did have standing to assert that the defendants were not in current compliance with their environmental permits, plaintiffs did not have standing to assert injuries that could be caused by rising sea levels and other effects of <mark>climate change</mark> that would occur &quot;far in the future.&quot;</P><H4>Federal preemption based on federal common law and Clean Air Act</H4><P>One of the grounds for removal to federal court asserted by the defendants in the San Mateo case is that the plaintiffs' claims are preempted by federal law. This argument is supported by the Supreme Court's 2011 decision in <EM>American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut</EM>, 564 U.S. 410 (2011) (&quot;<EM>AEP</EM>&quot;), where the court held that federal nuisance claims that seek to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions are displaced by the Federal Clean Air Act. The Ninth Circuit in Kivalina followed AEP to reach the same conclusion. <EM>See</EM> 696 F.3d at 857-58.</P><P>While the Supreme Court has yet to extend this federal displacement ruling to bar on preemption grounds claims brought under state nuisance laws, such as <EM>San Mateo</EM> and <EM>Oakland/San Francisco</EM>, a district opinion relied on AEP to conclude that such state law claims are also preempted by federal law. <EM>See Comer v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc.</EM> 839 F.Supp.2d 849, 865 (S.D. Miss. 2012). This conclusion is in line with the federal, or, more accurately – the global scope of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Indeed, as the <EM>San Mateo</EM> defendants argued in their removal petition, the plaintiffs' attribution theory of causation would necessarily require an over-arching analysis of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions across the United States, as well as all other nations across the world. The preeminence of federal law over such questions of interstate and foreign commerce and policy suggests that federal law preempts federal common law and state law nuisance claims that seek to abate <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and address any injuries caused by <mark>climate change</mark>. This is so that <mark>climate change</mark> policy can be developed by the democratically accountable branches of government in a coordinated way at the federal level, rather than via individual tort claims pursued under various theories of state tort law.</P><P>The <EM>San Mateo</EM> defendants also argue that the complaint implicates a number of federal questions that cannot be resolved under state law, including nationwide <mark>climate change</mark> and <mark>carbon</mark> emission policies and the federal regulatory framework governing <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. The removal petitions also raise numerous constitutional questions, such as whether state law can hold corporations liable for promoting an allegedly deceptive campaign to mislead the public as to <mark>climate change</mark>; whether the state nuisance claims will regulate interstate and foreign commerce; and whether due process permits plaintiffs to use state law to hold the defendants liable for the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, given that it is the combustion of fossil fuels, rather than the extraction and marketing of those fuels, that creates the <mark>carbon</mark> emissions that cause <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><H4>Political question doctrine</H4><P>The defendants in <EM>San Mateo</EM> and <EM>Oakland/San Francisco</EM> also may assert as a related defense the political question doctrine, which requires federal courts to abstain from deciding a case in a way that would impinge on the authority of another branch of government. The political question doctrine is rarely invoked, especially when a plaintiff has adequately shown that it has standing to sue. As such, the doctrine is not often discussed in the context of <mark>climate change</mark> litigation.</P><P>In the few cases in which the doctrine has been asserted as a defense, however, at least one district court has held that claims arising from alleged injuries caused by <mark>climate change</mark> are precluded by the political question doctrine because resolution of the claims would require the court to make an initial policy decision to <mark>climate change</mark>. <EM>See People of the State of Calif. v. General Motors, Corp.</EM>, No. C06–05755 MJJ, 2007 WL 2726871 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 17, 2007). Conversely, the Second Circuit, <EM>Connecticut v. American Electric Power Co.</EM>, 582 F.3d 309 (2d Cir. 2009), and Fifth Circuit, <EM>Comer v. Murphy Oil USA</EM>, 585 F.3d 855 (5th Cir. 2009), have reached the opposite conclusion, with the Fifth Circuit holding that tort claims rarely present political questions because the common law of torts provides sufficient rules for the adjudication of a case without interfering with the prerogatives of the other branches of government.</P><H4>Lack of proximate causation</H4><P>If these recent California complaints were to survive the above arguments for their dismissal at the motion to dismiss stage (an outcome we see as unlikely), it will be extremely difficult for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendants caused, or will cause, the alleged injuries. As in any tort suit, plaintiffs seeking to hold fossil fuel companies liable for the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> must show that the defendants' conduct was a proximate cause of the alleged injuries. The problem these plaintiffs will face in proving causation is similar to the problems faced by the plaintiffs in <EM>Kivalina</EM> and <EM>Bellon</EM>, where courts dismissed claims for lack of standing due to the fact that <mark>climate change</mark> is a process that has been occurring for decades as the result of countless emission sources. Indeed, given the inherently indefinite nature of the causal mechanism between <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from countless sources over a multi-decade period and particular issues alleged by a particular plaintiff that are quite localized in nature (<EM>e.g</EM>., rising sea levels off the coast of Northern California), how can a plaintiff show that the emissions of a group of fossil fuel companies selected as defendants in a particular litigation were the reasonably foreseeable cause of any particular plaintiff's alleged injury?</P><P>The plaintiffs in <EM>San Mateo</EM> appear to have attempted to solve this causation problem by alleging that the named defendants are &quot;directly responsible&quot; for approximately 20% of global emissions between 1965 and 2015, by virtue of their &quot;extraction, promotion, marketing, and sale of fossil fuel products.&quot; However, this theory raises several questions such as the following:</P><UL><LI>Does proving that the defendants were responsible for 20% of the global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions mean that the defendants should be fully liable (or 20% liable) to the plaintiffs for the plaintiff's alleged injuries caused by <mark>climate change</mark>?</LI><LI>Why are the defendants &quot;directly responsible&quot; for these emissions while the end users of their fossil fuels bear no responsibility for <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, including private and commercial drivers of cars and trucks; the automobile and airline industries; coal and natural gas power plants; and various other individuals, companies and governments who use fossil fuels to meet their energy needs?</LI><LI>Exactly what is the tortious conduct of these defendants plaintiffs are alleging that caused plaintiffs' injuries? Was it the extraction and sale of fossil fuels, their promotion, or defendants' alleged denials or failures to disclose the effects of fossil fuel production on <mark>climate change</mark>?</LI><LI>Are the plaintiffs arguing that regulators would have banned or severely curtailed the sale of fossil fuels – the energy foundation of our economy since the industrial revolution – had defendants not allegedly denied the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>?</LI><LI>Are plaintiffs arguing that regulators and the scientific community at large did not also know for decades about the potential links between <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and <mark>climate change</mark>?</LI><LI>Can the plaintiffs prove that the defendants' conduct, including their alleged deception as to the causes and effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, led to higher emissions than otherwise would have been the case?</LI><LI>For example, if the defendants had curtailed, or even halted altogether, their efforts to extract, promote, market and sell fossil fuels, what effect would that cessation have had on global emission levels, if any? Would various other private and government entities that are also providers of fossil fuels (not named as defendants in these cases) have increased their own sales as a result?</LI><LI>With respect to the particular injuries being alleged of rising sea levels in California coastal communities, how will plaintiffs demonstrate that these rising sea levels are due to <mark>climate change</mark> in general, let alone the particular emissions of the defendants named in these lawsuits, as opposed to other geological factors?</LI></UL><P>Plaintiffs will have to satisfactorily answer difficult causation questions such as the above in order to prove tort liability and entitlement to remedial relief if the cases were to proceed past the motion to dismiss stage of the litigation. Moreover, many of these same causal questions, as explained above, will merit consideration as part of the analysis of more threshold legal issues to be decided at the motion to dismiss stage, such as lack of standing and federal preemption.</P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><H3>Conclusion</H3><P>The <EM>San Mateo</EM> and <EM>Oakland/San Francisco</EM> complaints face major stumbling blocks at the motion to dismiss phase, and are likely to suffer similar fates as did the plaintiffs in <EM>Bellon</EM> and <EM>Kivalina</EM>.</P><P>While courts have generally been inhospitable territory for <mark>climate change</mark>-related litigation, these cases will be monitored by all sides to see if they can survive into the discovery or judgment phases. Any success by the plaintiffs would increase the prospects of similar suits by other coastal cities and municipalities in California and in other US states. By contrast, the failure of these California claims to proceed past the motion to dismiss stage of litigation could temper enthusiasm for additional lawsuits in this area, at least if the primary goal of these suits is to obtain remedial relief.</P><P>On the other hand, if a principal goal is to use litigation as an instrument of promoting the political and public policy agenda of those funding or pursuing these lawsuits (<EM>e.g.</EM>, by looking to raise public awareness and galvanize public support for stronger <mark>climate change</mark> regulation), then future <mark>climate change</mark>-related claims may still be brought, even if the prospects of winning these cases in the litigations themselves remain extremely remote.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-views pane-our-people-node pane--borderBottom paneTitle--caption""><DIV class=""widthContain""><H2 class=""pane-title"">Key Contacts</H2><DIV class=""view view-our-people-node view-id-our_people_node view-display-id-block_2 profileListing profileListing--carousel view-dom-id-64341feebf5d1fc258f8a6f9deb3d2c3""><DIV class=""view-header""><P>If you have any questions, or would like to know how this might affect your business, phone, or email these key contacts.</P></DIV><DIV class=""view-content""><DIV class=""views-row views-row-1 views-row-odd views-row-first""><DIV class=""views-field views-field-rendered-entity""><SPAN class=""field-content""><DIV about=""/our-people/benjamin-rubinstein"" typeof=""sioc:Item foaf:Document"" class=""ds-2col-stacked node node--contact view-mode-contact_display_block  node--contact-display-block node--contact--contact-display-block clearfix""><BUTTON class=""contactCard-buttonWrapper""><DIV class=""group-left""><DIV class=""field field--name-field-contact-title field--type-text field--label-hidden lang-en""><DIV class=""field-items""><DIV class=""field-item even"">

      <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""mailto:avittorio@bna.com"">Andrea Vittorio</A></I></P><P>Pressure by pension funds, endowments and other large investors for corporate action
   on <mark>climate change</mark> is expected to become even more prevalent this proxy season. 
</P><P>“We can assume we’re not going to see government leadership on <mark>climate change</mark>” under
   the next administration, Edward Kamonjoh, former head of U.S. strategic research and
   analysis at Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., told Bloomberg BNA. 
</P><P>Given President-elect Donald Trump’s skepticism of established <mark>climate</mark> science, it
   will be up to shareholders to push companies such as <mark>Chevron Corp.</mark> and Exxon Mobil
   Corp. to assess and address business risks from <mark>climate change</mark>, he said. 
</P><P>Last proxy season, there were about 175 <mark>climate</mark>-related shareholder resolutions, according
   to a tally by the sustainability advocacy group Ceres. This season, the total could
   climb even higher. 
</P><H5>Targeting Boards</H5><P>If investors aren’t satisfied with companies’
   response to the resolutions and engagement, Kamonjoh said their boards could later
   be targeted with a director-nomination mechanism called proxy access. Proxy access
   typically allows a group of up to 20 investors who have collectively held at least
   3 percent of outstanding stock for at least three years to nominate a portion of the
   board.
</P><P>After decades of corporate resistance to the idea, more than a third of S&amp;P 500 companies
   have adopted proxy access provisions over the past two years, according to a 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://www.ey.com/gl/en/issues/governance-and-reporting/ey-four-takeaways-from-proxy-season-2016"">tally</A> by Ernst &amp; Young LLP. So far, a shareholder has tried only once to nominate a board
   candidate via proxy access. Gamco Asset Management Inc. withdrew its nominee after
   its eligibility to use the process was challenged by National Fuel Gas Co.
</P><P>“Most investors view proxy access as a last resort, if all engagement fails,” Jamie
   Smith, of EY’s Center for Board Matters, said. 
</P><P>In the past, shareholders have tried using resolutions to add an environmental expert
   to the boards of oil and gas companies, mining companies and electric utilities. Among
   the top 25 investor-owned utilities in the U.S. by revenue, only three have a board
   member with discernible <mark>climate change</mark> expertise, based on an April 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://irrcinstitute.org/reports/the-top-25-u-s-electric-utilities-<mark>climate</mark>-change-corporate-governance-and-politics/"">analysis</A> of board biographies by the <mark>Sustainable</mark> Investments Institute. Additional research
   is planned for release in January. 
</P><H5>‘<mark>Climate</mark> Competency.’ </H5><P>“Board accountability is the key to corporate transformation and proxy access is expected
   to help lessen the inertia by firms, especially in the energy sector, to account for
   <mark>climate change</mark>,” said Kamonjoh. He was recently named executive director of a resource
   and action center called the 50/50 <mark>Climate</mark> Project that is working with 50 large investors
   that collectively manage $13 trillion in assets to improve the “<mark>climate</mark> competency”
   of boards at 50 <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive companies. 
</P><P>Getting the right to nominate their own directors on the corporate ballot was one
   of the 50/50 <mark>Climate</mark> Project’s first priorities when it formed in the fall of 2014.
   New York City’s pension funds led the push, 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""http://comptroller.nyc.gov/services/financial-matters/boardroom-accountability-project/overview/"">filing</A> 75 shareholder resolutions for proxy access at once. Among the companies targeted
   were those considered by the city’s comptroller to be vulnerable to long-term business
   risks from <mark>climate change</mark>, including Chevron and Exxon Mobil. 
</P><P>The 50/50 project is now readying a bench of potential board candidates who are independent
   and understand <mark>climate</mark> science.
</P><P>Proxy access “puts owners into a much more powerful position,” said Anne Simpson,
   investment director of sustainability at the $300-billion California Public Employees’
   Retirement System. CalPERS, another one of the investors involved in the project,
   recently updated its 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/board-agendas/201603/invest/item05a-02.pdf"">governance principles</A> to include an expectation for <mark>climate</mark> expertise on the boards of companies in its
   stock portfolio.

		</FIGCAPTION></SOURCE><P>But such comments mask the fact that oil and gas companies are approaching a crossroads. Exxon continues to behave as though economic growth and <mark>carbon</mark> emissions are one and the same—the company predicts that 60 percent of the world’s energy needs will still be met by oil and gas by 2040. But <A href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601415/<mark>carbon</mark>-dioxide-emissions-keep-falling-in-the-us/"" target=""_blank""><mark>carbon</mark> emissions have decoupled from economic productivity</A>. And the <A href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/544896/our-energy-transformation-in-2015/"" target=""_blank"">Paris <mark>climate</mark> accords</A> could significantly impact demand for fossil if the signatory countries follow through on their promises.</P><P>Other oil companies seem to be getting the message. Shell recently announced <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/15/shell-creates-green-energy-division-to-invest-in-wind-power"" target=""_blank"">the creation of a green energy arm</A> that will be funded with $1.7 billion in investments. And French oil giant Total pledged to push 20 percent of its assets into low-<mark>carbon</mark> investments over the next 20 years. In a <A href=""http://www.total.com/sites/default/files/atoms/files/integrating_<mark>climate</mark>_into_our_strategy_eng.pdf"" target=""_blank"">strategy paper</A> (PDF) released Tuesday, Total’s CEO Patrick Pouyanne said that the Paris accords made it clear that there was a global mandate to try to limit global warming to that 2 °C threshold.</P><P>“COP21 was definitely a watershed,” he said, using the acronym for the Paris meeting. “Despite the current instability worldwide, 195 countries managed to unite around an ambitious <mark>climate</mark> agreement. That sends a strong message.”</P><P>In this light, Chevron and Exxon Mobil are looking more and more like holdouts—<A href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601471/big-oil-companies-have-already-become-dinosaurs/"" target=""_blank"">slow-moving dinosaurs who are behind on <mark>innovation</mark></A>, even. They appear to be banking on a business model that, while profitable for now, is unlikely to sustain them for much longer as the rest of the industry gets serious about transitioning away from fossil fuels.</P></SOURCE></SOURCE></SOURCE></PICTURE></FIGURE></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

Seven resolutions have already been withdrawn after negotiations with the target companies, according to Ceres' database.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">The November 2017 SEC bulletin said the agency would take no action against companies that toss proxies because they either deal with the &quot;day to day business&quot; of a firm or, in contrast, have little direct connection to the business.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">The opinion has already resulted in new 2018 proxy proposals at Exxon Mobil Corp. and EOG Resources Inc. being thrown out as being too close to &quot;micromanaging&quot; by shareholders. </P><P class=""MsoNormal"">Similar resolutions in 2017 drew votes from the big index funds, and a recent study indicated that those funds will swing even more votes against oil and gas managers who do not acknowledge a low-<mark>carbon</mark> future. <SPAN>While the <mark>climate change</mark> proposals differ slightly, most ask oil and gas companies to either analyze of the impact of operating in a world where <mark>carbon</mark> emissions are reduced to keep global temperatures from rising by 2 degrees C or report on plans to reduce methane emissions. </SPAN></P><P class=""MsoNormal"">Arjuna Capital LLC investment manager Natasha Lamb called the SEC's Exxon decision &quot;disturbing, a threat to shareholders' rights&quot; that worries managers of funds oriented toward environmental, social and governance goals.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">Exxon's most recent <mark>climate change</mark> report, issued only after 62% of Exxon shareholders overruled the board at the 2017 annual meeting, disappointed Lamb, but she said April 3 that she was not surprised. &quot;Exxon left the risks out of its risk report,&quot; Lamb said. &quot;This company is not going to change.&quot;</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">While Exxon did not return a call for comment, the industry's top trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, said its companies make every effort to work with shareholders. &quot;<SPAN>Oil and natural gas companies regularly conduct outreach, engagement and respond to their shareholders,&quot; spokesman Reid Porter said in a statement April 3. &quot;On <mark>climate change</mark> specifically, companies place considerable resources and priority in <mark>innovation</mark>s to produce and deliver energy safely and with a smaller and smaller environmental footprint. In fact, the development, transportation and use of U.S. natural gas is the main driver of a steady drop in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to near 25-year lows today.&quot;</SPAN></P><P class=""MsoNormal"">Arjuna and the As You Sow Foundation pushed again this year for Exxon to detail at this year's shareholder meeting how it would change its asset mix in a world emitting less and less <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. The SEC quashed that proposal, saying those questions were answered in the February <mark>climate</mark> report, in which Exxon said the world would keep using hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s for the foreseeable future and Exxon stood little risk of having assets stranded by reduced demand from a lower-<mark>carbon</mark> economy.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">In contrast, the SEC on March 28 denied <mark>Chevron Corp.</mark>'s request that an almost identical proposal, also sponsored by Arjuna and As You Sow, be removed from its annual ballot. Chevron's reasoning differed from Exxon's: Chevron said disclosing how it might change its asset mix to counter <mark>carbon</mark> emission restrictions could hurt its chances in ongoing court cases. </P><P class=""MsoNormal"">Unless the SEC steps in, shareholders in oil and gas companies including independent producers Devon Energy Corp. and Chesapeake Energy Corp. and pipeline giant Kinder Morgan Inc. are all proposing their companies report on plans for business in a world where <mark>carbon</mark> is limited.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">&quot;About oil and gas companies, I have my greatest skepticism,&quot; Tom Sanzillo, director of finance for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and a former manager of New York state's $150 billion pension fund, said in an interview. Sanzillo said the world economy is in a fundamental shift away from fossil fuels and advises investors to drop oil and gas companies from their portfolios as poor performers, having trailed the benchmark S&amp;P 500 for most of the past five years. &quot;[Oil and gas companies] used to lead the world economy. Now they are last. An effective fiduciary would drop fossil fuels from their index.&quot;</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">Moreover, Sanzillo said, the SEC is helping pave the way by ruling out fundamental business questions as micromanagement. &quot;The SEC proxy rules are designed to squeeze the meaning out of shareholder rights,&quot; he said. &quot;Simple question for shareholders: What remedial strategies are the companies now taking that allows them to conclude that more drilling is the answer to company financial problems when they just destroyed some $200 billion plus of share value by increasing drilling? This would probably be ruled out of order.&quot;</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">&quot;Shareholder dialogue with companies only works if there is a real potential for change,&quot; he said.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article__details--desktop""><UL class=""article__details-list""><LI class=""article__details-list-title"">Author</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

And as the Trump administration seeks to play down <mark>climate change</mark>, some states are pushing back. Now, two California cities have brought a lawsuit against the <mark>Chevron Corpo</mark>ration and other big oil companies, looking to find them responsible for their role in <mark>climate change</mark>. And because the federal judge in the case felt he wasn’t quite up on his <mark>climate</mark> science, he asked each side to teach him how they view the state of the research.</P><P>Molly Peterson was in that courtroom and is here to fill us in on that story. She’s a reporter for KQED Science out there in San Francisco. Thanks for joining us this hour.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah, my pleasure.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So each side had a different tactic for presenting the <mark>climate</mark> data. Tell us. Chevron was the only company, though, representing all the oil companies.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah, that day, he was. So for both sides, the judge wanted both the current state of the science and a kind of history of what they knew, what scientists knew, when they knew it. Each side had two hours to present. The cities turned it over to scientists. The City Attorney was there to introduce scientists to give this story. And Chevron used a lawyer to convey its information.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So what was his argument?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Well, I mean, he went on the record saying, it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the 20th century. So Chevron says, it has been its position for 10 years that it accepts the findings of the IPCC report. But at the same time, Chevron was also pointing out and casting doubt wherever it could on how certain scientists were about the influence of humans on <mark>climate change</mark> over this time.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: And so San Francisco and Oakland are the two cities involved in this case. And so they presented their side.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: And their side focused a lot on sea level rise, because obviously, that’s a major concern in California. And I should say that this is part of this growing body of cases, not just San Francisco and Oakland, but the city of Richmond, San Mateo County, Imperial, Beach in Southern California, these other cities are also suing using different legal strategies that one historian of science kind of told me reminded him of the tobacco lawsuits.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Yeah. And so, they’re upset, of course, that if the oceans are rising, they’re going to be underwater. And they can show, then, that there is actual money damages that are going to occur to their cities.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: That’s right. I mean, in San Francisco in particular, they’re talking about billions of dollars, including, I think, a $350 million bond that might be on the ballot there later this year. The city’s got engineers and consultants out there, trying to figure out what would happen to the Embarcadero along San Francisco. So yeah, they are connecting it to that.</P><P>And so, the presence of IPCC science and scientists was interesting and important, because the most recent IPCC was 2013, 2014. The end of the data for that report was 2012. And a lot has happened in sea level rise science since then.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Now, I understand this isn’t the first time that this judge has done research for a court case.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: No, it’s not. And he doesn’t do it exclusively in science. But he did it for LIDAR in a case involving self-driving cars. He did it for DACA recently. He’s famous for having taught himself how to program in Basic, and for learning a few lines of Java for a case involving Oracle.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Wow. So where does this head? This is not the actual court case itself, right?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: It’s not. In fact, Chevron was kind of subtly trying to make this argument that it is also filed with the court a motion to dismiss. Chevron says, this is a global problem. It needs a global solution. So even though they’re saying that human activity contributed to this, they say that they’re beyond the reach of this court. So the judge still has to rule on that.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So do all of the oil companies agree with what Chevron is saying?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Well, at the of the hearing, the judge looked at the other oil companies and said, do you agree with everything this guy said? And they all kind of sat there. And he said, well, you can have two weeks, which is up just about now, for them to weigh in on every single word that was said. So he said to them, his message was clear, you can’t get away sitting here in silence.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So there’s going to be a lot more we’re going to hear about this, as it moves forward.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah. I mean, it is interesting that the judge is trying to figure out how to use this science as evidence, if the case goes forward. Yeah,</P><P>IRA FLATOW: And how, then, to turn it into damages, if you’re going to penalize somebody. What’s your role or your part in it?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah. I mean, with the tobacco cases, I think we’re talking about $250 billion so far that tobacco companies have paid as settlements.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Well, we’ll see. Thank you, Molly, for taking time to be with us today. We’ll check in later as it’s necessary.

They also allege the companies mounted campaigns to downplay the risks of global warming and discredit research that human activity was to blame.</P><P>The companies have asked Alsup to dismiss the lawsuits. Federal law controls fossil fuel production, and Congress has encouraged oil and gas development, they said in court documents. They added that the harm the cities claim is &quot;speculative&quot; and part of a complex chain of events that includes billions of oil and gas users and &quot;environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades.&quot;</P><P>&quot;The relief that plaintiffs seek would require a single judge sitting in San Francisco to unilaterally change the nation's energy and environmental policies,&quot; Joshua Lipshutz, an attorney for Chevron, said on a call with reporters.</P><P>The lawsuits say the companies have created a public nuisance and should pay for sea walls and other infrastructure to protect against the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> — construction that could cost billions of dollars.</P><P>New York City, several California counties and another California city have filed similar suits.</P><P>San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said the city looks forward to providing the &quot;objective history of <mark>climate change</mark> science.&quot;</P><P>&quot;We'll see whether big oil acknowledges the scientific consensus and its role in causing <mark>climate change</mark> or doubles down, once again, on deception,&quot; he said in a statement.</P><P>Chevron will not engage in a debate about <mark>climate change</mark>, but instead present the conclusion of an international panel of scientists which said it is extremely likely that humans are the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-1900s, said Avi Garbow, another attorney for Chevron.</P><P>Alsup said in a court filing about Wednesday's tutorial that he wants to know whether the collective heat from burning fossil fuels contributes to warming and if so, how. He also wants to know the main sources of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide that account for the buildup of the gas in the atmosphere.</P><P>Deciding the lawsuits in favour of Oakland and San Francisco would be &quot;revolutionary&quot; and open the door to myriad similar lawsuits, so Alsup may want to establish a strong base of scientific knowledge on <mark>climate change</mark>, said David Takacs, a professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law who studies <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;He has to dot his i's and cross his t's,&quot; he said. &quot;It has to be a long public display that 'The science is making me rule on behalf of the plaintiffs.'&quot;</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-subscribe-callout article__bottom-content paywall-showonloggedout""><H2 class=""pane-title"">

Evidence from history strongly suggests that a heightened societal focus on their <mark>climate</mark> responsibilities will be needed to hasten such a transition.</P></SECTION><DIV class=""KeywordGroup"" lang=""en""><H2 class=""Heading"">Keywords</H2><SPAN class=""Keyword"">Chevron </SPAN><SPAN class=""Keyword"">Anthropogenic <mark>Climate Change</mark> </SPAN><SPAN class=""Keyword"">American Petroleum Institute </SPAN><SPAN class=""Keyword"">Social License </SPAN><SPAN class=""Keyword"">Shareholder Resolution </SPAN><DIV id=""test-keyword-message"" class=""u-interface u-italic"">

The concept of responsibility is central to the United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (UNFCCC), adopted at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. Parties to that convention agreed that the industrialized nations—which had produced the lion’s share of greenhouse gas emissions—should take the lead in combating <mark>climate change</mark> “on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities” (United Nations <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR65"">1992</A></SPAN>).</P><P id=""Par3"" class=""Para"">The concept of “differentiated” responsibility signaled the recognition both that industrialized (Annex I) nations had produced most of the emissions, and that their wealth was intimately linked to the economic activities that produced those emissions (Shue <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR61"">1999</A></SPAN>). The Kyoto Protocol thus focused attention on emission cuts by Annex I nations.</P><DIV id=""Par4"" class=""Para"">This focus was consistent with the general ethical principle, as well as the common sense of daily life, that responsibility for a problem is assumed to fall on those who create it, particularly if they do so knowingly (Rawls <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR55"">1971</A></SPAN>). Definitions of responsibility become intricate as people have divergent interpretations of what exactly the problem is, how to assess its costs, how to identify the responsible party or parties (particularly if many individuals or groups contributed), how fully they apprehended the consequences of their actions, and whether reasonable alternative actions were available to them. In the context of <mark>climate change</mark>, several competing views have been put forward about the allocation of responsibilities. The Brazilian Proposal, for example, analyzed by the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technical Advice (SBSTA), suggested that the burden of addressing <mark>climate change</mark> should be apportioned on the basis of cumulative historic emissions (Rive et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR56"">2006</A></SPAN>), rather than annual ones, because it is the former that drive global <mark>climate change</mark>. Differing allocation schemes dramatically alter the ranking of the most responsible nations (Fig. <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Fig1"">1a–d</A></SPAN>).<FIGURE class=""Figure"" id=""Fig1""><DIV class=""MediaObject"" id=""MO1""><A href=""https://media.springernature.com/original/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10584-015-1472-5/MediaObjects/10584_2015_1472_Fig1_HTML.gif"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><SPAN class=""u-screenreader-only"">Open image in new window</SPAN></A></DIV><FIGCAPTION class=""Caption"" lang=""en""><DIV class=""CaptionContent""><SPAN class=""CaptionNumber"">Fig. 1</SPAN><P class=""SimplePara"">Under allocation schemes based on current annual CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from fossil fuels and cement production, China leads the pack, followed by the U.S. and India (<STRONG class=""EmphasisTypeBold "">a</STRONG>).

One option is to focus on individuals. Noting that nations with similar total emissions (e.g., USA and China) may have very different <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">per capita</EM> emissions (Baer et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR5"">2000</A></SPAN>), some commentators have proposed the concept of equal <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">per capita</EM> allocation over time, with convergence toward a common per capita emission rate (Höhne et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR28"">2006</A></SPAN>). Others have suggested that the wealthiest individuals in the world, regardless of nationality, should bear a larger share of the burden (Chakravarty et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR13"">2009</A></SPAN>).</P><P id=""Par6"" class=""Para"">Another option is to focus on industry. Recent lawsuits have drawn attention to the responsibilities of major emitting industries, particularly in transportation and electric power generation (Osofsky <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR51"">2012</A></SPAN>). Shareholder resolutions and calls for institutional and individual divestment from the primary producers of coal, oil, and natural gas are giving rise to growing public discourse on the <mark>climate</mark> responsibilities of these fossil fuels companies (Lubber <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR37"">2012</A></SPAN>; Oreskes <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR49"">2013</A></SPAN>; Rockefeller Brothers Fund <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR57"">2014</A></SPAN>).</P><P id=""Par7"" class=""Para"">This paper focuses on the distinctive responsibilities of the investor-owned fossil fuel producers. First, we explore the conceptual territory of responsibility and the historical evidence that social change has resulted when notions of corporate responsibility have shifted in response to changing social values. We then present empirical evidence for the role of specific fossil fuel corporations, including many of the 90 largest industrial <mark>carbon</mark> producers whose products are responsible for nearly two-thirds of all known industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1751 (Heede <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR27"">2014</A></SPAN>). We emphasize that more than half of all industrial emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide have occurred since 1988: after the establishment of the IPCC, after leading scientists had stated publicly that anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> was underway, and after a vigorous and visible public discussion of its causes and risks had begun.</P><P id=""Par8"" class=""Para"">We highlight producers for five reasons. First, a relatively small number of corporations have produced the fossil energy that has contributed a large proportion of the total historic emissions that drive disruptive <mark>climate change</mark>. Second, as major corporations with a high level of internal scientific and technical expertise, they were aware of and in a position to understand the available scientific data. Third, an alternative was available to them: they could have adjusted their business models to anticipate policies motivating a transition to low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy by substantially investing in low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy technologies, constructively engaging in policy design, and taking other steps to reduce the adverse impact of their products. But they did not. Even today, they continue to explore for new and increasingly more <mark>carbon</mark>-polluting sources of fossil fuels, encouraging the expanded use of the products that they know to be responsible for disruptive <mark>climate change</mark>. Fourth, fossil fuel producers, particularly in the United States but also in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, have sought to discredit and disparage the scientific evidence, and to deny, diminish, or discount the reality and significance of <mark>climate change</mark> as a problem (Gelbspan <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR22"">2005</A></SPAN>; Ward <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR67"">2006</A></SPAN>; Oreskes and Conway <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR50"">2010</A></SPAN>). Many companies lobbied to prevent policies that would encourage the transition to low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy and continue to do so today, including through the influential industry trade associations on whose boards of directors many of the largest companies sit (Wieners <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR68"">2014</A></SPAN>).</P><P id=""Par9"" class=""Para"">Finally, we focus on producers because there has been strikingly little attention paid in academic and policy spheres to their <mark>climate</mark> responsibilities. Society at large has been unaware of, or perhaps unwilling to confront, this issue. This paper seeks to open up the question of their responsibilities to academic and policy analysis.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec2"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1""><H2 class=""Heading""><SPAN class=""HeadingNumber"">2 </SPAN>What is responsibility?</H2><DIV class=""content""><P id=""Par10"" class=""Para"">The concept of responsibility is central to the question of obligation to act. One familiar notion of responsibility involves damages: individuals and groups can sue for damages if they believe another party has injured them. But there are many other ways in which society holds both individuals and institutions accountable for the consequences of their actions. In the private sector, shareholders may divest from a corporation that has engaged in inappropriate business practices or behavior; consumers may decline to buy products. When parties are found responsible for engaging in illegal activities, they may be subject to governmental sanction, through restrictions on the sale or marketing of harmful products, civil fines, or criminal penalties. Ultimately, if consumers, regulators, legislatures, shareholders, or the public at large disapprove sufficiently of an activity, it may become impossible for a firm to remain in business, or at least to continue business as usual.</P><P id=""Par11"" class=""Para"">Changing notions of corporate responsibility have played an important role in social change (Gunningham et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR25"">2004</A></SPAN>). The most well-documented example involves tobacco. For decades, the tobacco industry argued—with considerable success—that responsibility for the ills of smoking rested with the smoker: individuals made a choice to smoke, and any resulting illness was their responsibility. However, as the evidence of the harms of tobacco became known, this argument was increasingly rejected by a society that concluded that manufacturing a product that killed people, even if legal, was morally problematic. In 1995 the U.S. Department of Justice concluded that the industry was legally culpable for knowingly spreading disinformation, bringing charges against the industry under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) act (Eubanks and Glantz <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR17"">2012</A></SPAN>).</P><P id=""Par12"" class=""Para"">The story of tobacco is not unique: history is replete with examples of products and activities that were once accepted but later rejected. Often this shift has hinged on scientific knowledge. Asbestos for example, was a legal product, viewed by many as a miracle material that saved lives. But when the scientific evidence became clear that asbestos caused asbestosis and mesothelioma, both its primary producers and the manufacturers of products containing it found themselves facing tens of thousands of lawsuits (Bowker <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR7"">2003</A></SPAN>; Michaels <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR41"">2008</A></SPAN>). Plaintiffs won many suits, particularly if their exposure occurred after the scientific evidence of the risks was established (Castleman <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR12"">2005</A></SPAN>). The fact that asbestos was a legal product did not absolve corporations of their responsibility to protect workers and consumers from its adverse effects. A parallel story has been told about lead. While lead in paint was a legal product, companies have nevertheless been held liable for the damage it has caused (Markowitz and Rosner <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR39"">2013</A></SPAN>).</P><P id=""Par13"" class=""Para"">Changing notions of corporate responsibility within civil society gain traction through shareholder resolutions, consumer boycotts, protests, lawsuits, and media (including social media) and divestment campaigns; these, in turn, can drive changes in regulation (Gunningham et al <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR25"">2004</A></SPAN>). Corporations engaged in mining, pulp and paper manufacturing and the marketing of soy, beef and palm oil have responded to such pressures to go beyond compliance with legal standards for environmental and social sustainability (Gunningham et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR25"">2004</A></SPAN>; Prno and Slocombe <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR54"">2012</A></SPAN>; Nepstad et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR45"">2014</A></SPAN>). In effect, these companies have recognized that they must have a social license to operate.</P><P id=""Par14"" class=""Para"">Turning to fossil fuels, some producers acknowledge that their ability to conduct business also requires a social license. Royal Dutch Shell, for example, has recently affirmed that “<EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">real or perceived failures of governance or regulatory compliance could harm our reputation. This could impact our licence to operate</EM>, <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">damage our brand</EM>, <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">harm our ability to secure new resources and limit our ability to access the capital market</EM>.” Shell has also claimed to embrace the principle of <mark>sustainable</mark> development, which, they suggest “<EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">is a licence to operate imperative</EM>” (Royal Dutch Shell plc <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR58"">2010</A></SPAN>, <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR60"">2014</A></SPAN>). Shell implicitly acknowledges that the fiduciary requirement of returning value to shareholders does not absolve corporations of broader ethical responsibilities. History affirms that conclusion. A corporation’s abilit<EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">y</EM> to return value to shareholders is influenced by, and in the long run depends upon, social license.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec3"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1""><H2 class=""Heading""><SPAN class=""HeadingNumber"">3 </SPAN>Quantifying the responsibility of industrial <mark>carbon</mark> producers</H2><DIV class=""content""><DIV id=""Par15"" class=""Para"">An enormous quantity of emissions can be traced to a relatively small number of fossil fuel producers.

In 1988, <mark>climate change</mark> went from a prediction to an observation, when NASA scientist James Hansen testified in the U.S. Congress that the human signal in <mark>climate change</mark> had been detected (Hansen et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR26"">1988</A></SPAN>). Hansen’s testimony was reported on the front page of <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">The New York Times</EM>, which concluded that the “issue of an overheating world had suddenly moved to the forefront of public opinion” (Wilford <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR69"">1988</A></SPAN>). Members of the U.S. Congress introduced H.R. 5380, The National Energy Policy Act of 1988, intended to “establish a national energy policy that will quickly reduce the generation of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and [other] trace gases as quickly as is feasible in order to slow the pace and degree of atmospheric warming…to protect the global environment.” Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush ran for president of the United States pledging to combat the “greenhouse effect with the White House effect” (New York Times Editorial Board <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR46"">1990</A></SPAN>). 1988 was also the year in which the world nations joined together to create the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) to provide a scientific basis for policy action. Fossil fuel corporations might have begun to take steps to limit the damages their products caused to the global environment.</P><P id=""Par17"" class=""Para"">Instead, leading investor-owned fossil fuel corporations, including ExxonMobil, Shell, and British Petroleum, created the Global <mark>Climate</mark> Coalition (GCC) to oppose greenhouse gas emission reduction policies. From 1989 to 2002, the GCC led an aggressive lobbying and advertising campaign aimed at achieving these goals by sowing doubt about the integrity of the IPCC and the scientific evidence that heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels drive global warming. They worked successfully to prevent the United States from signing the Kyoto Protocol after it was negotiated in 1997. When the GCC disbanded, they stated that they had achieved their goals (Mooney <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR42"">2005</A></SPAN>). A similar pattern of activities was undertaken in the early 1990s by a group known as the “Greening Earth Society,” funded by a consortium of U.S. coal corporations (Oreskes <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR48"">2010</A></SPAN>).</P><DIV id=""Par18"" class=""Para"">An alternative was possible. In 1997, British Petroleum CEO John (later Lord) Browne gave a major speech at Stanford University pledging to move BP to a new business model that went “beyond petroleum.” Invoking the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark> described in the IPCC Second Assessment report (Houghton et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR29"">1995</A></SPAN>), he said:<BLOCKQUOTE class=""BlockQuote""><P id=""Par19"" class=""Para"">“[W]e are all citizens of one world, and we must take shared responsibility for its future and for its <mark>sustainable</mark> development…[T]here is now an effective consensus among the world’s leading scientists and serious and well-informed people outside the scientific community that there is a discernible human influence on the <mark>climate</mark> and a link between the concentration of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and the increase in temperature .[I]t would be unwise and potentially dangerous to ignore the mounting concern. We in BP… alone could not resolve the problem. But that does not mean we should do nothing. …We have a responsibility to act [and] BP accepts that responsibility…” (Browne <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR10"">1997</A></SPAN>)</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><P id=""Par20"" class=""Para"">Browne’s speech was a major departure from the prevailing industry pattern. The <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Los Angeles Times</EM> concluded it was akin to the Liggett Group’s acknowledgment earlier that year that smoking caused cancer and heart disease, the first major tobacco company to do so (Gerstenzang <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR23"">1997</A></SPAN>). It was met with public praise and anticipation of action. The <EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Financial Times</EM> reported that “BP’s stance sets a higher standard against which to judge other companies’ readiness to cooperate with governments to fight <mark>climate change</mark>” (Allen and Bach <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR1"">2011</A></SPAN>).</P><P id=""Par21"" class=""Para"">Following the speech, BP and several other companies took steps in the direction that Browne envisaged (Kolk and Levy <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR35"">2001</A></SPAN>). In 1997, BP became the first company to leave the Global <mark>Climate</mark> Coalition; Shell Oil (U.S.) left the following year. In 1998, BP established an internal cap-and-trade system reducing internal emissions by ten percent over the next 4 years, and began to invest in solar energy, forming BP Solar in 1999. These measures were touted in a major advertising campaign launched in 2000 to rebrand BP as “Beyond Petroleum.” Shell and Chevron also made targeted investments in renewable energy, totaling as much as 2.5 % of each company’s annual expenditures during the past decade (Juhasz <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR34"">2013</A></SPAN>). In 2007, BP, ConocoPhillips, and Shell became charter members of the U.S. <mark>Climate</mark> Action Partnership (USCAP), a coalition of business and environmental groups seeking to shape U.S. federal legislation to reduce greenhouse gases.

Instead, many of the largest fossil energy companies pursued a business model that coupled doubt-mongering about <mark>climate</mark> science with political advocacy against <mark>carbon</mark> regulations and in support of aggressive development of new sources of fossil fuels. Industry lobbying factored heavily in the 2001 rejection of the Kyoto Protocol by the U.S. administration under President George W Bush (Vidal <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR66"">2005</A></SPAN>) and in the failure of the U.S. Senate to take up federal <mark>climate</mark> legislation after a comprehensive cap on emissions passed the U.S. House of Representatives in 2009 (Mackinder <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR38"">2010</A></SPAN>; Grandia <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR24"">2009</A></SPAN>; Oreskes <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR48"">2010</A></SPAN>). In effect, the industry created a self-fulfilling prophecy: The absence of <mark>carbon</mark> regulation would ensure that fossil fuels would continue to be a good investment, and the companies would maximize profits for their shareholders to the detriment of the world at large by continuing to expand fossil fuel discovery and development.</P><P id=""Par26"" class=""Para"">Between 1988 and 2005, ExxonMobil invested over $16 million in a network of front groups that spread misleading claims about <mark>climate</mark> science (leading to strong public condemnation from the British Royal Society: Ward <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR67"">2006</A></SPAN>). It also exploited its close relationship with the administration of President George W.

They use <mark>climate</mark> projections to identify new opportunities to exploit fossil resources that are becoming accessible as a result of melting sea ice and other consequences of global warming.

On the contrary, they argue that the world needs more fossil fuels rather than less. ExxonMobil (<SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR19"">2014b</A></SPAN>), for example, in its 2014 energy outlook, insists that oil and gas will continue to be our major energy sources for the foreseeable future; the terms “<mark>climate change</mark>” or “global warming” are nowhere to be found.</P><DIV id=""Par36"" class=""Para"">BP, Shell, and ExxonMobil have each developed detailed projections of future energy use.
