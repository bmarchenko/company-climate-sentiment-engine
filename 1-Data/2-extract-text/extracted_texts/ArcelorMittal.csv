This year, Amazon launched the Kindle Fire, the latest and boldest move in a drive to transform Amazon from a retail company into a technology conglomerate that can challenge the likes of Apple and Google for pre-eminence in the market for digital videos, music and books. This represents a complete reinvention of the company under Jeff Bezos, who made huge early bets on eReaders and the back-end infrastructure of cloud computing.</P><P>Under Paul Polman, <STRONG>Unilever</STRONG> launched its <mark>Sustainable</mark> Living Plan late in 2010. The plan is considered similar in significance to M&amp;S’s Plan A. Now the company has been rolling out the plan across its divisions. The company also opted out of quarterly earnings reports in order to focus on building the business.</P><P>Research firm <STRONG>Muddy Waters Research</STRONG> has made a business out of carrying out due diligence on Chinese companies listed in North America, and claimed success this year by exposing problems at Sino-Forest, the Chinese forestry group listed in Toronto. Muddy Waters has forced a big downward rerating of Chinese-linked stocks in the US by challenging the accuracy and honesty of their accounts.</P><P><STRONG>Helveta</STRONG> supplies technology that maps timber supply chains, tracking wood from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon and other countries to furniture makers across the world. The Oxfordshire company, launched in 2004,uses satellite mapping technology, radio tags and barcodes to track teak and other hardwood in line with laws designed to stop illegal logging. This year, Helveta won a multimillion-dollar contract to provide a national traceability system for Congo Brazzaville – a sign of the international drive against illegal logging and the desire by timber producers to obtain premium<STRONG> </STRONG>prices by proving their timber is legal.</P><P>The story of Olivia Lum’s journey from her childhood home – an illegally built house with a leaky tin roof in Malaysia – to the modern offices of <STRONG>Hyflux</STRONG>, is both long and inspiring. The company she founded is now a world leader in membrane-based water treatment. Hyflux floated in Singapore in 2001. The number of Hyflux employees has increased from 30 to 2,300 in the past 10 years. Ms Lum won the 2011 Ernst &amp; Young World Entrepreneur of the Year award – the first woman to do so in its 11 year history.</P><P><STRONG>Samsung Electronics</STRONG> certainly ruffled a few feathers in 2011.The South Korean company is locked in roughly 20 legal disputes in nine countries with its biggest rival and key customer, Apple. In October, it overtook Apple to become the world’s largest seller of smartphones as shipments rose 40 per cent in the third quarter. Sales of its smartphones, which use Google’s Android software, have quadrupled in the past year, and Samsung is now a serious competitor to the iPhone maker.</P><P>Only a few weeks after becoming one of the few Europeans to reach the top of a large Japanese company, <STRONG>Michael Woodford, Former chief executive, Olympus</STRONG> sent shockwaves through the Japanese business world by publicly questioning more than $1bn of payments made by Olympus for a string of takeovers. He was summarily sacked by the board of Olympus. But his claims triggered a massive fall in the company’s share price and, in early November, the camera maker admitted it had used acquisition fees to conceal losses on securities investments dating back to the 1990s. By standing up for corporate standards Woodford deserves the greatest of respect.</P><H4>Judges Biographies</H4><P><STRONG>Lionel Barber</STRONG> has been editor of the Financial Times since November 2005. Previously, he was US managing editor, editor of the European edition and news editor. He has also been Brussels bureau chief and Washington correspondent.</P><P><STRONG>Lakshmi</STRONG> <STRONG>Mittal</STRONG> is chairman and chief executive of <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>. Mr Mittal founded Mittal Steel in 1976 and built it through a series of high-profile acquisitions, culminating in the takeover of Arcelor in 2006, creating the world’s largest steelmaker. He is a member of the Indian Prime Minister’s Global Advisory Council and the World Economic Forum’s International Business Council.</P><P><STRONG>Dipak Jain</STRONG> is Dean of INSEAD, the international business school based in Fontainebleau (France), Singapore and Abu Dhabi.  He is also the INSEAD Chaired Professor of Marketing. Professor Jain’s enduring and illustrious career spans nearly three decades both as an educator and as a business school administrator.</P><P><STRONG>John Authers</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG>is the FT’s senior investment columnist. He was previously global head of the Lex column and has held a number of other positions during his 20-year career at the Financial Times. Auther’s latest book is <EM>The Fearful Rise of Markets</EM>.</P><P><STRONG>Luke Johnson</STRONG> is chairman of Risk Capital Partners, a private equity firm he founded in 2001 and plays a leading role in the operations of all the company’s investments which include the Giraffe restaurant chain, Patisserie Valerie and Signature Restaurants.  He writes a weekly column for the Financial Times.</P><P><STRONG>Anne Méaux</STRONG> is president and founder of Image Sept a Paris-based public affairs and media relations consultancy. She was communications adviser to Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, the former president of France, and communications adviser to the cabinet of Alain Madelin, French minister of industry.</P><P><STRONG>Terry Smith</STRONG> is a veteran stockbroker who began his long association with the City in 1974.

Collectively, they consume the equivalent energy of more than 1.2 million U.S. households annually.</P><P>Under the program run by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and its counterparts in Canada and Mexico, the participants receive training and technical assistance to achieve an energy performance standard known as <A href=""http://www.energy.gov/eere/amo/iso-50001-frequently-asked-questions"">ISO 50001</A> and, upon demonstrating sustained energy savings, earn <A href=""http://www.energy.gov/eere/amo/superior-energy-performance"">Superior Energy Performance</A> (SEP) certification. I have been working with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) on developing and improving 50001, and its associated guidance standards, since 2009. </P><P>The voluntary ISO 5001standard provides a framework for organizations to better manage and continually improve their energy performance, including increasing the energy efficiency of their operations. Facilities in the U.S. Department of Energy-managed SEP program have met the ISO standard and improved their energy performance <A href=""http://www.energy.gov/eere/amo/superior-energy-performance"">up to 30 percent</A> over three years. For example, nine SEP-certified facilities have already saved, on average, <A href=""http://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/04/f21/superior_energy_performance_factsheet_0.pdf"">more than $500,000 a year</A> from improvements with little or no capital costs.</P><P>Business participation in the cross-border energy-saving program highlights the kind of international cooperation that is critically needed to combat global <mark>climate change</mark>.  </P><H3>The economic benefits</H3><P>It also underscores business' understanding of the significant economic benefits from smarter energy use and the potential economic costs of failing to respond to <mark>climate</mark> danger. The bipartisan business-focused <A href=""http://riskybusiness.org/"">Risky Business</A> Project warned of the potential costs to the U.S. economy from lower crop yields in the Midwest to massive property losses from rising sea levels on the East and Gulf Coasts.</P><P>The international standards are important to business, as the standards-setting <A href=""http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/benefitsofstandards.htm"">International Organization for Standardization</A> has noted, because they &quot;ensure that business operations are as efficient as possible, increase productivity and help companies access new markets.&quot;</P><P>The <A href=""http://www.ansi.org/"">American National Standards Institute</A> (ANSI) has called standards &quot;essential tools helping today's businesses stay innovative, reduce costs, improve quality and market their products or services.&quot;</P><P> &quot;They help break down barriers to trade, provide industry stability and encourage commerce,&quot; ANSI noted.</P><P>Earlier this year, I co-authored an op-ed with ANSI's Jason Knopes with the title: &quot;<A href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/265929-energy-efficiency-standards-help-businesses-thrive-and-consumers-save""><EM>Energy efficiency standards help businesses thrive and consumers save</EM></A>&quot; that reaffirmed the point that when specific standards are analyzed for their effects on the environment, jobs, and on economic benefits versus costs, it's apparent that standards overcome failures of the market and enhance economic growth.</P><H3>Successful savings</H3><P>The <A href=""http://www.cec.org/energy-program"">North American Energy Management Pilot Program</A>'s benefits have been demonstrated. For example,<A href=""http://www.cleanenergyministerial.org/Portals/2/pdfs/GSEP_EMWG_Case_Study_Cummins.pdf""> Cummins, Inc.</A>, which implemented an energy management system at its Rocky Mount, N.C. engine manufacturing facility, improved energy performance by 12.6 percent, saving the company $716,000 annually. (In joining the pilot program, Cummins will now participate with three of its Mexico manufacturing facilities.)</P><P><A href=""http://www.energy.gov/eere/amo/articles/us-manufacturer-going-above-and-beyond-superior-energy-performance"">General Dynamics</A> improved the energy performance at an ammunition plant in Scranton, Pa. by about 12 percent for a projected annual energy cost savings of $956,000, using the ISO energy management standard.</P><P>And <A href=""http://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/09/f18/GSEP_EMWG-Nissan_casestudy.pdf"">Nissan</A> improved the energy performance of its vehicle assembly plant in Smyrna, Tenn., by about 7.2 percent. Its annual energy bill as a result is projected to drop $938,000.</P><P>Other success stories can be found on the <A href=""http://www.energy.gov/eere/amo/business-case-sep#case-studies"">DOE</A> website.</P><P>Since publication of the ISO 50001 standard in 2011, more than 15,000 facilities worldwide are realizing average energy-performance improvements of 10 percent or more, according to the <A href=""http://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/north-american-governments-announce-pilot-program-accelerate-regional-adoption-energy"">U.S. Energy Department</A>. Success through 50001 is not a onetime deal.

Québec: A leader in the fight against <mark>climate change</mark>!</H1><P>The Government of Québec views the fight against <mark>climate change</mark> as a fundamental and top priority issue for Québec’s future. Working proactively with its partners, Québec will continue to move forward on the basis of progress that has already been accomplished. 
</P><P>With income derived mainly from the <A href=""marche-<mark>carbon</mark>e_en.asp""><mark>carbon</mark> market</A>, the Government of Québec supports companies, Québec municipalities and private citizens in the transition to a low <mark>carbon</mark> world. By 2020, Québec will have invested more than 3.3 billion dollars to implement the measures set out in the 
	<A href=""plan-action-fonds-vert-en.asp"">2013-2020 <mark>Climate Change</mark> Action Plan</A>, measures that will enable us to reduce GHG emissions and better adapt to the consequences of <mark>climate change</mark>. 
</P><P>These measures call upon innovative solutions from our scientists and entrepreneurs and open the door to developing Québec expertise in cutting-edge niche markets that will enable Québec to accelerate its shift to a <mark>sustainable</mark>, prosperous and competitive economy. The fight against <mark>climate change</mark> is a promising pathway towards developing an economy that is both robust and low <mark>carbon</mark>. 
</P><P>Working together, we can fight <mark>climate change</mark> and ensure a better quality of life for our children. Let’s do it for them!

Moctezuma was regarded as a semi- divine figure by his subjects charged with the task of interceding with the gods. As a battle-hardened general he was appointed supreme military commander and headed the two most prestigious warriors orders: the eagle and jaguar warriors.  He was elected as Ruling Lord (<EM>huey tlatoani</EM>) in 1502, built a new palace in the heart of Tenochtitlan (modern day Mexico City) and restructured the court. The arrival of the Spanish, during Moctezuma’s reign, witnessed the collapse of the native world order and the imposition of a new civilization that gave birth to modern Mexico.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">Uniquely, the exhibition will present a biographical narrative of Moctezuma II and reveal the dual nature of his reputation. On the one hand, he is recognised as a successful and cunning warrior but he is also widely perceived as a tragic figure who ceded his empire to foreigners. Divergent interpretations of his mysterious death will be re-examined in the exhibition.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">The exhibition will present masterpieces of Aztec culture including the impressive stone monument known as the Teocalli of Sacred Warfare, amongst other works commissioned by Moctezuma himself which bear his image and his name glyph.  An exquisite turquoise mask and goldwork will showcase the consummate craftsmanship of artisans employed in the Aztec court and masterly paintings known as “Enconchados” (oil paintings on wooden panels with inlaid Mother of Pearl detail) portray the events of the conquest in vivid detail. Idealized European portraits of Moctezuma and stunning colonial Codices have helped shape our interpretations of Moctezuma and his world.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">The exhibition is supported by <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> and has been conceived in partnership with the National Institute for Anthropology and History (INAH), Mexico City. Additional support has been given by the airline partner, Mexicana.</P><P>To book tickets phone +44 (0)20 7323 8181 or <A href=""default.aspx?page=26717"">book online</A></P><P>For further information or images please contact Esme Wilson on +44 (0)20 7323 8394 or <A href=""mailto:ewilson@britishmuseum.org"">ewilson@britishmuseum.org</A></P><H3>About the exhibition</H3><P>The exhibition tells the story of Moctezuma II, the last elected ruler of the Aztecs, more correctly known now as the Mexica. From 1502 until 1520 he presided over a large empire embracing much of what is today central Mexico. This exhibition examines his life, reign and controversial death during the Spanish conquest.  The Spanish arrived on Mexican shores in 1519, led by Hernan Cortes. They were initially well received in the Aztec capital, but distrust and violence ensued. Moctezuma was captured and met his death shortly afterwards. Overcoming resistance, the Spanish went on to conquer his empire. Moctezuma’s life and dramatic death are explained through objects ranging, from sculpture, gold and mosaic items to codices and European paintings. The objects are drawn from Mexican, European, US collections and the British Museum’s own collection.</P><H4>Introduction</H4><P>According to myth, the ‘Aztecs’ were the ruling lords in the land of ‘Aztlan’. One subject group managed to escape their rule and began a long migration, adopting the name ‘Mexica’. The Mexica settled in the Basin of Mexico, founding their capital Tenochtitlan in about 1200. They spoke Nahuatl, one of many indigenous languages. ‘Aztec’ has been popularly but incorrectly used to describe the Mexica civilisation since the 1800s. The name ‘Mexica’ (pronounced ‘Mesheeka’) was recognised by the conquering Spanish, hence the name for modern Mexico.</P><P>Moctezuma’s fame is more celebrated in Europe than in Mexico itself. The exhibition opens with an idealised European portrait of Moctezuma from the 1600s. It is accompanied by a stone box that was owned by Moctezuma. This bears his identifying name-glyph, which will be encountered again in later sections. The exhibition will reveal what we know of Moctezuma’s life before the arrival of the Spanish. </P><H4>The Aztecs (Mexica)</H4><P>The Mexica capital city, Tenochtitlan, was located on an island set in Lake Tetzcoco in the Basin of Mexico. The first section of the exhibition looks at the foundation myth and features objects relating to this mythology, including a greenstone heart and a large eagle sculpture. From its beginnings in about 1300, Tenochtitlan rapidly grew to become a thriving metropolis. Moctezuma was the last in a long line of Aztec rulers and lived in a palace adjacent to the main ceremonial precinct in the heart of Tenochtitlan. His immediate predecessor was his uncle Ahuitzotl.</P><H4>Moctezuma as ruler</H4><P>Moctezuma is introduced through his coronation stone. We will explain how, once nominated to succeed his uncle, he had to prove himself through military campaign before being formally invested. At his coronation in 1502 he was given the insignia of office including treasured turquoise and gold items of personal adornment. Moctezuma built a new palace to administer the empire and lived there with his wives, children and the courtly entourage. A number of architectural fragments from the palace excavations will be on display.</P><H4>Religion and the gods</H4><P>Moctezuma was a vital intermediary with the Mexica gods and was himself regarded by his subjects as a semi-divine figure. He worshipped at the Great Temple, a huge stepped pyramid in the heart of the ritual centre of Tenochtitlan. We will display a model that will show the Temple and other ritual buildings. Moctezuma would have carried out blood-letting rituals, and ordered the sacrifice of captives. We will examine the most important gods, including Quetzalcoatl. It is a popularly held belief that Moctezuma considered Cortes to be a personification of the returning deity Quetzalcoatl, although this has been challenged by recent scholarship. The end of the section focuses on the New Fire Ceremony. This marked the end of a 52-year period in the Mexica calendrical cycle that occurred during Moctezuma’s reign and can be dated to 1508.</P><H4>Warfare and empire</H4><P>Moctezuma was a formidable warrior and head of the Mexica army. We will display a range of ceremonial weaponry as well as an imposing monument sculpted with Mexica warriors. Particularly important was the site of Malinalco, where the elite Jaguar and Eagle warriors were based. Moctezuma consolidated the Mexica empire and secured tribute, or taxes, that poured into Tenochtitlan. Exacting tribute in the form of raw materials or crafted goods contributed to the opulence of the court but meant that Moctezuma was feared and resented among subject towns.</P><H4>Conquest</H4><P>The Spaniard Hernan Cortes landed on the coast in 1519 along with a few hundred men. At the same time, the Mexica are said to have witnessed strange omens and signs that are later depicted in the codices. Moctezuma sent emissaries to the coast with gifts for Cortes. Cortes forged alliances with bitter rival of the Mexica in the course of his march to Tenochtitlan. Moctezuma greeted Cortes but made the fatal mistake of allowing the Spanish into Tenochtitlan and housing them in a palace. The Spanish captured Moctezuma and unrest broke out in the city following a massacre of Mexica nobles by the Spanish. Shortly afterwards Moctezuma died – and it is widely believed that he was stoned to death by his own people. However, other sources claim that he was in fact secretly murdered by the Spanish. The main events of the conquest are documented by a series of colonial paintings.</P><H4>Moctezuma in history</H4><P>After Moctezuma’s death, the Spanish conquered the Mexica empire with assistance from Moctezuma’s enemies. We will display items that were later repurposed by the Spanish, such as a serpent sculpture that was inverted to form a baptismal font. Moctezuma’s daughters Isabel and Mariana and son Pedro survived the conquest. Codices show how they went to Spain and intermarried with the nobility there. Moctezuma has an ambivalent reputation within Mexico today, but his fame lived on as a figure of fascination within Europe. The exhibition ends with European portraits of Moctezuma. There depict him as a once-proud warrior and tragic figure who surrendered his empire but whose fame live on.</P><H3>Notes to Editors</H3><P class=""MsoNormal"">Tickets are now available to book, telephone 020 7323 8181 or <A href=""default.aspx?page=26717"">book online</A></P><P class=""MsoNormal"">To coincide with the exhibition there will be a free related display in our Prints and Drawings gallery (Room 90) looking at modern Mexican prints called <STRONG><EM>Revolution on Paper: Mexican Prints 1910-1960</EM></STRONG> (22 October 2009 - 28 February 2010).</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">The exhibition will be the first ever in Europe focusing on the great age of Mexican printmaking in the first half of the twentieth century. Between 1910 and 1920 the country was convulsed by the first socialist revolution, from which emerged a strong left-wing government that laid great stress on art as a vehicle for promoting the values of the revolution. This led to a pioneering programme to cover the walls of public buildings with vast murals, and later to setting up print workshops to produce works for mass distribution and education. Some of the finest of these prints were produced by the three great men of Mexican art of the period: Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. The exhibition will also include earlier works around the turn of the century by the popular engraver, José Guadalupe Posada, who was adopted by the revolutionaries as the archetypal printmaker who worked for the people, and whose macabre dances of skeletons have always fascinated Europeans. Supported by The Monument Trust and the Mexico Tourism Board.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">A full public programme will accompany the exhibition. More information is available from the press office.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">An accompanying catalogue will be published by British Museum Press. <EM>‘Moctezuma: Aztec Ruler’</EM> edited by Colin McEwan and Leonardo López Luján costs £40 (hardback) and £25(paperback) and will be available from August 2009.</P><H4><STRONG>About <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark></STRONG></H4><P class=""MsoNormal""><mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> is the world's leading steel company, with operations in more than 60 countries and approximately 10% of global steel manufacturing capacity.

This included, best quality services from efficient staff and the provisuion of new, modern furniture. The project aims at improving mother and child bonding, reducing child abandonment at nursery level, making pregnancy and maternity safer and improving parental skills.</P><P>“We are proud to take part in helping the new generation have a proper start in life and we thank our partners from UNICEF for making this project a reality”, stated Augustine Kochuparampil, C.E.O. <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> Galati. “We are committed to continue our support for the young generation despite the difficult conditions the steel industry is facing, as we see ourselves as long term partner for the local community of Galati”. </P><P>The babies who will be born at the Maternity from Saint Andrei County Emergency Hospital will get the best start in life. They will be together with their mothers from the first moments of life, which is the first step for their healthy emotional development. Being all the time with the mother, the children will be breastfed when they are hungry, and not according to a rigid schedule. The mothers will get essential information from the nurses on the benefits of breastfeeding, on how to breastfeed correctly and how to properly take care of their babies.  </P><P>“Breastfeeding is the first right of a baby and we want this right to be respected in all maternities in Romania. In Galati, this was possible with the contribution of <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>, which offered more than financial support. UNICEF appreciates the efforts of the personnel from the Galati Nursery to change detrimental practices and mentalities of feeding and taking care of babies. It is an investment in the wellbeing of thousands of children born each year in Galati, in their families and the community they enter into”, said Edmond McLoughney, UNICEF Representative in Romania.</P><P>The first part of the two years project involved completely refurnishing 25 rooms with beds and mattresses and room furniture for mothers and babies. </P><P>UNICEF Romania and <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> Galati volunteers brought 105 beds and mattresses for mothers, 86 for babies, 105 nightstands, 47 swaddle tables and mattresses, 53 tables and chairs for the rooms, 24 tables and 90 chairs for the canteen. </P><P>Also, the entire maternity personnel – 15 doctors and 57 nurses – were instructed to promote breastfeeding and to offer mothers special attention. This translated into counselling on proper baby feeding and into advice on proper care of the children. Mothers at risk of abandoning their babies are counselled and supported to keep and care for their children. The programme also aims at increasing the quality of services offered by the Maternity staff, and is part of the National Strategy to promote breastfeeding, implemented by the Health Ministry. </P><P>The programme is managed by UNICEF and consists of 10 steps the hospital has to take representing the standards of quality and good practice that the entire Maternity personnel use in their relationship with the mother and child. By the end of this year, the Maternity will be evaluated and certificated as “Baby-Friendly Hospital”. </P><P> </P><P><STRONG>About Arcelor Mittal</STRONG><mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> is the world's leading steel company, with operations in more than 60 countries.<mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> is the leader in all major global steel markets, including automotive, construction, household appliances and packaging, with leading R&amp;D and technology, as well as sizeable captive supplies of raw materials and outstanding distribution networks.

Reduce <mark>CO2</mark> emissions by 8% per tonne of steel produced by 2020 based on 2007 baseline.
 

 

<DIV id=""subHeadline"">Implementation methodologies</DIV>


Our target is to reduce our <mark>CO2</mark> emissions by 170kg per tonne of steel by 2020. This is equivalent to an 8% reduction in normalised emissions from the 2007 baseline. This group target was set in 2008 based on analysis of 2007 <mark>CO2</mark> emissions data, identifying the potential <mark>CO2</mark> savings across the sites.
Reducing our energy footprint is one of our top priorities. Based on our energy policy published in 2008, we have developed internal energy management good practices, compatible with energy management standard ISO 50001, aiming to speed up the detection and implementation of all energy saving opportunities.
We will achieve these savings mainly by improving the process management, implementing energy management systems and using better technologies. We are implementing our good practices at all our major sites and several smaller ones.
Progress Description:
<mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>'s <mark>CO2</mark> emissions per tonne of steel have reduced from 2.184 in 2008 to 2.13 in 2012. The rate of reduction has been slower since the financial crisis started in 2008 as steel production has reduced significantly. Lower production of steel typically leads to reduced energy efficiency, and higher <mark>CO2</mark>/tonne of steel.  If steel demand rises sufficiently in 2013 to improve the utilisation of our plants, and especially of these Africa and CIS sites, we expect our <mark>CO2</mark> emissions per tonne of steel to drop and to contribute to the long-term trend of reduced emissions. In addition, <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> continues to make investments in <mark>CO2</mark>/energy  saving equipment which will continue to support our 2020 target.

	For better or worse, corporations have a major influence on <A href=""https://www.ecowatch.com/<mark>climate</mark>-change/""><mark>climate change</mark></A> policy. Just look at <A href=""https://www.ecowatch.com/tag/koch-brothers"" target=""_blank"">Koch</A> Industries, a multinational conglomerate owned by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch that has <A href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=d000000186&amp;cycle=A"" target=""_blank"">contributed</A> hundreds of millions to federal candidates and lobbying over the last 25 years.

	The &quot;Corporate <mark>Carbon</mark> Policy Footprint,&quot; a new analysis from U.K. nonprofit <A href=""http://influencemap.org/"" target=""_blank"">InfluenceMap</A>, now ranks Koch Industries as the company with the strongest opposition to the <A href=""https://www.ecowatch.com/tag/paris-agreement"">Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement</A> and most intensely lobbies  against policies in line with the landmark global accord.
</P><P style="""">
	The InfluenceMap <A href=""http://influencemap.org/page/About-our-Scores"" target=""_blank"">scoring system</A> does not measure a company's actual greenhouse gas emissions. Rather, it measures &quot;the extent to which a corporation is supporting or obstructing the <mark>climate policy</mark> process.&quot;
</P><P>For the InfluenceMap report, researchers analyzed more than &quot;<A href=""https://influencemap.org/filter/List-of-Companies-and-Influencers"" target=""_blank"">30,000 pieces of evidence</A>&quot; on 250 global companies and 50 major trade associations on their lobbying records, advertising, public relations and sponsored research, according to <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-12/these-companies-are-most-influential-in-<mark>climate</mark>-policy-debates"" target=""_blank"">Bloomberg</A>.

</P><P style=""margin-left: 20px;"">
	&quot;Koch Industries appears to be actively opposing almost all areas of <mark>climate</mark> legislation. In 2014 in the US, they were <A href=""https://influencemap.org/evidence/Not-supporting-<mark>carbon</mark>-tax-9a8bc27ae8008a57e3beae9f2d1b4aba"" target=""_blank"">reportedly active</A> in their opposition to a <mark>carbon</mark> tax, funding <A href=""https://influencemap.org/evidence/Opposing-<mark>carbon</mark>-tax-a53c1bbc8a94c65d01d385d012a92078"" target=""_blank"">politicians</A> and <A href=""https://influencemap.org/evidence/Opposing-<mark>carbon</mark>-tax-62622d6b179ce88903699c10a29eac0a"" target=""_blank"">campaigns</A> to oppose the tax. Similarly, in 2014 they appear to have opposed the U.S. EPA Clean Power Plan in <A href=""https://influencemap.org/evidence/Opposing-GHG-emissions-standards-5f0a1cd5fcc94df4266d414a3bfc16be"" target=""_blank"">consultation</A> and through <A href=""https://influencemap.org/score/Koch-Industries-Q11-D5"" target=""_blank"">direct engagement with policy makers</A>, and boasted about <A href=""https://influencemap.org/evidence/Opposing-emissions-trading-2732ce23d80fde2f613b75d57f89a96e"" target=""_blank"">their success</A> in blocking the US Cap and Trade Scheme in 2010. Additionally, they appear to be opposing measures to transition to a low <mark>carbon</mark> economy, advocating against <A href=""https://influencemap.org/score/Koch-Industries-Q9-D2"" target=""_blank"">renewable energy subsidies</A>, and funding groups that have opposed <A href=""https://influencemap.org/evidence/Not-supporting-energy-efficiency-standards-175c9a8f15d95e4fc4270f7908b94bf2"" target=""_blank"">energy efficiency standards</A>, the <A href=""https://influencemap.org/score/Koch-Industries-Q10-D5"" target=""_blank"">repeal of fossil fuel subsidies</A> and <A href=""https://influencemap.org/score/Koch-Industries-Q2-D5"" target=""_blank"">the need for action on <mark>climate change</mark></A>. They seem to be <A href=""https://influencemap.org/score/Koch-Industries-Q9-D5"" target=""_blank"">exceptionally active in opposing renewable energy standards</A> across the U.S. Both <A href=""https://influencemap.org/score/Koch-Industries-Q1-D2"" target=""_blank"">the organization</A> and its CEO, <A href=""https://influencemap.org/evidence/Supporting-<mark>climate</mark>-change-denial-89f9d5305e3f442e407aba0007783fb5"" target=""_blank"">Charles Koch</A>, appear to have questioned <mark>climate change</mark> science, and have reportedly <A href=""https://influencemap.org/evidence/Supporting-<mark>climate</mark>-change-denial-f9955585659cd26f237341f69aa793f9"" target=""_blank"">funded <mark>climate</mark> denial</A>.

	On the opposite end of the spectrum, Silicon Valley tech giant Apple was ranked highest on the list and <A href=""https://influencemap.org/company/Apple-385f398538b2e6145dcb8afdc945c263"" target=""_blank"">has an A+</A> for its support of <mark>climate change</mark> action and its positive engagement with a number of <mark>climate change</mark> policy areas.
</P><P>
	Here are the report's key findings:
	
</P><UL class=""ee-ul""><LI>35 of the 50 most influential are actively lobbying against <mark>climate policy</mark>. They include
companies in the fossil fuel value chain (ExxonMobil, Valero Energy, Chevron), energy intensive
companies (BASF, <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>, Bayer, Dow Chemical and Solvay) and electric utilities with large
amounts of coal generating capacity (Southern Company, Duke Energy and American Electric
Power).
	</LI><LI>Also in this group of 35 influential companies holding back <mark>climate policy</mark> are four powerful
automotive manufacturers (Fiat Chrysler, Ford, BMW and Daimler). The research found the
companies lobbying to delay or dilute efficiency and <mark>CO2</mark> emissions standards and procedures
both in Europe and North America. Depending on region, passenger vehicle emissions account
for 12% or more of all greenhouse gas emissions. 
	</LI><LI>
	On the other side, 15 of the 50 most influential are pushing for an ambitious <mark>climate policy</mark> agenda, favoring renewable power and electric vehicles. They include signatories to the RE100 initiative committing to buying 100% renewable power (Apple, Ikea, Unilever, Coca Cola and Nestle) as well as power sector companies (SSE, Enel, EDF, Iberdrola and National Grid) who are shifting their business models towards low <mark>carbon</mark> electricity generation. </LI></UL><P>
	&quot;The data shows the <mark>climate policy</mark> agenda, in terms of corporate influencing, is being driven by a small number of massive global corporations,&quot; Dylan Tanner, InfluenceMap executive director, said in a statement. &quot;It also shows a group of powerful of companies in the tech, consumer goods and utilities sectors increasingly pushing for policy to implement the Paris Agreement.&quot;
</P><P>
	InfluenceMap also ranked &quot;<A href=""https://influencemap.org/filter/List-of-Companies-and-Influencers"" target=""_blank"">influencers</A>&quot; or powerful trade associations that actively lobby against <mark>climate</mark> policies. A number of trade associations received an &quot;F&quot; grade, but here are the bottom five: U.S. Chamber of Commerce; American Petroleum Institute; American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity; National Mining Association; and the American Legislative Exchange Council.

Over the next few decades this is expected to grow with output. The process of making steel from iron ore involves heating the ore with <mark>carbon</mark>. <mark>Carbon</mark> dioxide is produced as a by-product of this process.</P><P>Source: <A href=""http://www.cleanenergyministerial.org/Portals/2/pdfs/GlobalActiontoAdvanceCCS.pdf"">http://www.cleanenergyministerial.org/Portals/2/pdfs/GlobalActiontoAdvanceCCS.pdf</A></P><P><mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> is the world’s largest steel producer, with annual production capacity of approximately 114 million tonnes of crude steel. Steel shipments in 2015 totaled 84.6 million tonnes. It has steelmaking facilities in 19 countries, and is the leader in all the main steel markets. A large number production sites for <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> are present in Europe.[1]</P><P><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline""><STRONG>Regulations</STRONG></SPAN></P><P>The European Union uses the emissions trading system (EU ETS) as a primary tool to limit <mark>climate change</mark>. A cap is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted by installations covered by the system. Companies can receive or buy emission allowances which they can trade with one another as needed. They can also buy limited amounts of international credits from emission-saving projects around the world. After each year, a company must surrender enough allowances to cover all its emissions, otherwise heavy fines are imposed. If a company reduces its emissions, it can keep the spare allowances to cover its future needs or else sell them.[2] While the steel industry has not been impacted by specific stringent regulations, there is a chance that in the future they will be asked to comply to emission norms which are tighter than the current norms.</P><P>The implications of ETS and future regulations are multi- fold for European steel companies like <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>.</P><UL><LI>They must find innovative ways to cut down on emission to avoid getting on the wrong side of regulations.</LI><LI>They must compete in an economy where the playing field is not level since steel producers in Asia are not yet subject to the same types of regulations. This means that efficiency in processes becomes imperative.</LI><LI>Demand for steel is affected by EU regulations related to automobiles. Automobile manufacturers are veering towards aluminum and manganese alloys to producer lighter and more efficient vehicles.[3]</LI></UL><P><STRONG> </STRONG><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline""><STRONG>What has <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> done?  </STRONG></SPAN></P><P><mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> has recognized the need to become more energy efficient and has invested in researching newer and more efficient methods to produce steel. The company is also designing products which have a lower <mark>carbon</mark> footprint during their lifetimes rather than just focusing on the production processes. It is partnering with customers to ensure that its products will help reduce global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions over a longer time. <mark>Carbon</mark> footprint can also be reduced indirectly by using de<mark>carbon</mark>ized electricity(hydroelectric power, nuclear power plants or power from renewable energy sources).[4]</P><P><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline""><STRONG>The future for <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark></STRONG></SPAN></P><P>The steel industry in Europe has managed to cut down its emissions by about 14 percent from 1990 to 2010.  There is however a limit to how much efficiency can be increased with current technology. There is need for either a major disruption in the production technology or to find ways to remove <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide produced. A couple of measures in this regard are listed below:</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Technology disruption</STRONG>: In 2013, a process developed at MIT produced only oxygen as a by-product. It does away with the blast furnace. While this process’s scalability is low, it does highlight the potential to change an industry which will need it desperately once the <mark>carbon</mark> emission norms are tightened.[5] The project at MIT was funded by NASA which was looking at methods to synthesize oxygen. <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> needs to invest in studies out of the traditional realm if it wants to be ahead of the curve in steel production.</LI></UL><UL><LI><STRONG><mark>Carbon</mark> sequestration: </STRONG>A lot of research has been happening over the last decade in <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration. <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> needs to actively locate processes which are more cost efficient and partner with the companies that can help them reduce their CO<SUB>2</SUB> An interesting company which has made great strides in this arena is <mark>Carbon</mark> Clean Solutions(CCS) which patented a process in 2009 for <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration. CCS has product designed for the steel industry which can help companies like <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> footprint.[6]</LI></UL><P>The future of the steel industry is contingent on how countries around the world react to <mark>climate change</mark> and what regulations are put into place. In addition, the demand for steel is also susceptible to different materials that can potentially disrupt dependent industries. Companies can <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> need to be aware of the challenges ahead and start working proactively to counter these effects.</P><P>Word Count: 798</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Based on this assessment, the Board has decided to proceed with the spin-off of the stainless steel business which it believes will maximise value for shareholders. Subject to shareholder approval, shares in the stainless steel business will be distributed to shareholders in the first quarter of 2011.</P><P>Shareholders will receive one stainless steel business share for every twenty <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> shares held on the record date. Stainless steel business shares will be listed on Euronext Paris, Amsterdam and in Luxembourg. In the United States, they will trade on the over-the-counter market in the form of NY Registry Shares. A prospectus describing the stainless steel business and transaction will be published later this month.</P><P>The spinoff is expected to result in a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $ 800 million as the stainless steel business will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 applicable to assets held for distribution. The final impairment charge will be assessed by <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> and reviewed by its auditors as at year end. Currency fluctuations and change in working capital are the main factors that between now and year end may influence the final impairment amount. No such impairment charge would be expected had the stainless steel segment remained in the scope of activities of <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>.</P><P>Following the spin-off, the stainless steel business will have approximately $1bn of net financial debt which will comprise a combination of existing <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> debt transferring with the stainless steel business and new debt raised by this business. As a result, the transaction is expected to be broadly neutral to <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>’s net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio.</P><P>The Stainless steel business shares have not been and will not be registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission or listed on any national securities exchange in the United States.</P><P>This document contains forward-looking information and statements about <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> and its subsidiaries. These statements include financial projections and estimates, including non-cash impairment charges, net financial debt and net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio, statements regarding plans, objectives and expectations with respect to future operations and statements regarding future performance generally. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the words “will,” “believe,” “expect” or similar expressions. Although <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>’s management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors and holders of <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>’s securities are cautioned that forward-looking information and statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>, that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially and adversely from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. These risks and uncertainties include those discussed or identified in the filings with the Luxembourg Stock Market Authority for the Financial Markets (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier) and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) made or to be made by <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>, including <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2009 filed with the SEC. <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> undertakes no obligation to publicly update its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</P><H2>About <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark></H2><P><mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> is the world's leading steel company, with operations in more than 60 countries. <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> is the leader in all major global steel markets, including automotive, construction, household appliances and packaging, with leading R&amp;D and technology, as well as sizeable captive supplies of raw materials and outstanding distribution networks.

It is the only steelmaking facility in the U.S. that is bordered on two sides by a national park. The plant operates two blast furnaces and is capable of producing 5 million tons of raw steel annually.</SPAN></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>One of the parts of the tour we got most excited about was the Hot Roll process, where slabs of steel 10 inches thick are heated to 2300°F and then reduced to a coil of steel 2000 feet long. Then they are rolled as you'll see in the photo below.</P><P>We all agreed we could stand around watching the process happen all day. It looked like a car wash, in a way: steel slabs on a long, long, long set of rollers, passing through periodic blasts of water from above that flatten them out, little by little. The steel is so hot that from over 50 feet away the temperature is still near 120 degrees. As the steel passed by on its roller-powered conveyor belt, we could feel the heat wash over us like a wave. Then the steel would pass and the temperature would drop back down to normal. It was just one piece of a pretty cool day for all of us.</P><P>Here's what staff members had to say about our outing:</P><H3><A href=""http://www.metroplanning.org/people/staff-member/?id=17"">Josh Ellis, program director</A>:</H3><P>I took away two things from the visit, and neither was really about steel. First, I personally have worked with the team from <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> on issues of land conservation and economic development in and around the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, which is just up the beach… and down for that matter. <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> is literally surrounded by federal and state protected land. I have always been impressed by their commitment to that landscape and waterscape and introducing it to the world. They are in constant dialogue with the National Lakeshore about land use and land holdings, and constantly engaging in stewardship activities.</P><P>Some of that may stem from the second thing I took away: Everybody seems to live right down the street. I asked several employees how far their commute was, and almost everyone said between 10 and 20 minutes, which means all their homes are in close proximity to Lake Michigan and the National Lakeshore as well. I recognize the tension inherent in being a steel mill in the middle of conservation lands, and the relationship isn’t perfect, but the combination of the work, the people and the place was striking. That’s the potential of place-based anchor institutions. It just so happens that these guys make the raw materials for actual anchors too.</P><H3><A href=""http://www.metroplanning.org/people/staff-member/?id=67"">Yonah Freemark, project manager</A>:</H3><P>&quot;Since the Burns Harbor plant produces an enormous share of the nation’s steel, the operations are contingent on a highly developed, well-organized logistics operation—particularly for rail freight. But the staff with whom we spoke noted that the Chicago rail hub, even with recent CREATE improvements, remains a significant obstacle to timely delivery of steel to customers. It is clear that more investment in the hub is necessary to guarantee efficient freight transportation in the region for many of the area’s largest employers, including companies like <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>.&quot;</P><H3><A href=""http://www.metroplanning.org/people/staff-member/?id=57"">Christina Harris, assistant development director</A>:</H3><P>Often, people do not think about how involved the process is to make seemingly simple everyday items we use on a daily basis, like our steel frying pans. But during the first part of our Arcelor Mittal field trip to Arcelor Mittal, I was struck by how intricate and complex steel making is. Think about it.  Through heating, Arcelor Mittal transforms rusty, brown iron ore into shiny, silvery steel. Before we can even get to the steel making, though, first the company transforms metallurgical coal into coke—driving off impurities through <STRONG>heating to 2,300°F degrees</STRONG> to produce almost pure <mark>carbon</mark>. Coke is considered essential to steelmaking given its ability to burn steadily and reliably, producing less smoke than coal. </P><DIV class=""call-r""><P>From left to right: William Steers, <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> with MPC staffers Nancy Firfer, Christina Harris, Yonah Freemark, Abby Crisostomo, Josh Ellis and Ariel Ranieri</P></DIV><H3><A href=""http://www.metroplanning.org/people/staff-member/?id=52"">Abby Crisostomo, project manager</A>:</H3><P>Before going to see a steel plant, I knew industries were major users of water, but it was amazing to see just how much clean water is integrated into every step of the manufacturing process—<STRONG>515 million gallons a day</STRONG> are used at <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>, though <STRONG>approximately 80 percent is returned back to Lake Michigan cleaner than it started.</STRONG> Everything from cooling hot slabs of metal to cutting slabs to the right size to even shipping the raw and finished goods to and from Burns Harbor—it’s no wonder <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> invests in water policy and research through funds like <A href=""http://www.sustainourgreatlakes.org/"">Sustain our Great Lakes</A> and the <A href=""http://www.nfwf.org/chi-cal"">Chi-Cal Rivers Fund</A> (<A href=""http://www.nfwf.org/chi-cal/Documents/2014Chi-CalRiversFundRFP.pdf"" target=""_blank"">RFP came out last week!</A>).</P><P>With the <A href=""http://blog.chicagolandh2o.org/2012/03/29/from-plumbing-codes-to-the-water-energy-nexus-what-can-illinois-do/"">water-energy nexus</A> in mind, it was nice to see, too, how they’ve invested in energy efficiency, acknowledging that it’s the little improvements—such as replacing light bulbs and installing variable switches—that have provided them major energy savings.

For example, <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> almost had to shut off their blast furnaces at Burns Harbor this winter because the weather was so bad for so long. Because iron ore, the main ingredient in steel, can only be efficiently transported by boat, they stockpile it during the warmer months and then hope they have enough for the winter.

The case goes back to 2012 when <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> closed its Schifflange site in Luxembourg but still <A href=""https://<mark>carbon</mark>marketwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/<mark>Carbon</mark>-leakage-myth-buster-Luxembourg_Nov_Final.pdf"">received</A> almost 81,000 <mark>carbon</mark> permits for free in that year, because it was late in notifying the Luxembourg authorities about the plant’s upcoming closure.</P><P>Meanwhile, <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> has made more than €500 million from the EU ETS since 2009 according to its own <A href=""http://corporate.<mark>arcelormittal</mark>.com/investors/financial-reports/annual-reports"">financial reports</A>, by receiving too many free permits and selling them on.</P><P><STRONG>What happened to ‘polluter pays’?</STRONG></P><P>Following another ruling by the Court last year that <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive industries have received too many free <mark>pollution</mark> permits, the European Commission <A href=""/?p=25090"">decided</A> to reduce the number of free <mark>pollution</mark> permits in the period 1 March 2017 to 2020 by up to 37 million allowances.</P><P>All this comes at a time when EU policymakers are revising the emissions trading rules. To retain at least a trace of the polluter-pays principle, these talks should result in the curtailment of the handouts of free <mark>pollution</mark> permits to the industry after 2020. Regrettably, a majority of the environment ministers and the European Parliament want to give heavy industry an additional 300 up to 775 million free <mark>pollution</mark> permits, on top of the already assigned 6.3 billion. The trialogue negotiations are hence likely to result in the continuation of subsidies for Europe’s worst polluters.</P><P><STRONG>Industry doubles down on earlier gains </STRONG></P><P>Steel companies have been particularly successful in their lobby for more <mark>pollution</mark> freebies, managing to convince Members of the European Parliament that they should receive over-compensation for waste gases in the future.

It also contradicts another recent <A href=""http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&amp;num=C-180/15"">ruling</A> by the Court of Justice on over-compensation for waste gases.</P><P>More auctioning of <mark>pollution</mark> permits and less free handouts will be key to bringing the Emissions Trading System back on track. Encouragingly, Lakschmi Mittal, CEO of <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>, has recently <A href=""https://www.ft.com/content/d104fdc4-f2b4-11e6-95ee-f14e55513608"">suggested</A> introducing a <mark>carbon</mark> tax “as the best answer on <mark>climate change</mark>”.</P><P>Making also importers to pay for their emissions would ensure that <mark>carbon</mark> costs are reflected in material prices and generate more public money that can be invested in making European industry the most innovative in the world.</P><P>In the absence of a robust EU ETS <A href=""https://act.wemove.eu/campaigns/ETS"">called</A> for by <mark>Carbon</mark> Market Watch and others, the EU needs to prepare the way for a variety of adjacent measures that help drive European industries towards a low <mark>carbon</mark> future.</P><P>Discussions between the European Parliament and the EU Member States are set to start on 4 April.</P><P><EM>by Dr. Agnes Brandt</EM> and <EM>Kaisa</EM><EM>Amaral</EM></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""col-md-3 col-md-pull-9 col-sm-4 col-sm-pull-8""><DIV class=""sidebar""><H3 class=""heading""><SPAN>Author</SPAN></H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

When that happens officials pour the metal from what are called torpedoes into slag beds. When the beds are wet or the molten iron seeps through the slag into the wet ground after a rain storm, significant emissions are released. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN>“It was a bit of a perfect storm for us,” Roger Tang-Poy, general manager of primary manufacturing for <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> Dofasco, told members of the Community Liaison Committee at its quarterly meeting Nov. 9.  </SPAN></P><P><SPAN>He said the reason for the coffining was because the crane that helps pours the steel lost electricity at about 5 a.m. on Oct. 8.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Jim Stirling, the company’s general manager of environment, said the giant emission was contained over Dofasco’s property and dissipated after about 75 seconds. He based it on photographs taken by company cameras. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN>But some members of the CLC, including Lukasik and Jochen Bezner, disputed that idea. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Lukasik, who is a member of the CLC, called the company’s statement to the media that the emission was contained to its property and therefore had no health impact to the community, “misleading,” even though data has shown that coffining emissions do contain particulate matter that can cause health problems for people.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""div1786"" style=""width:100%;float: left;"" class=""asset-body-part2"" loaded=""true"" lpos=""asset-body-part2""><DIV article="""" page="""" text=""""><P><SPAN>“We probably made a mistake when saying it didn’t have a health impact,” said Stirling, who announced that he was retiring from the company.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Matthew Lawson, Hamilton's program manager for public health, said despite the concern within the neighbourhood about the coffining plume, there should be more concern about the emissions from the company’s daily operations.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Lawson said public health officials have examined the air quality data from coffining and found “there is no compelling evidence on the community when coffining occurs.”</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>He said the city’s public health officials did not receive any indication from hospitals or residents about the impact of the emission after the Thanksgiving event.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Stephen Burt, Ministry of the Environment and <mark>Climate Change</mark> supervisor for the Hamilton office, agreed the emission shouldn’t have happened.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>But the company has already submitted a plan to reduce the impact of emissions on its property and meet its environmental order, including how to deal with unexpected emissions caused by coffining.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>“We want things to get better,” said Burt. “We do not want to see this happen.

According to the lawsuit, the plant committed over 226 violations of the facility’s <mark>pollution</mark> limits for the hazardous gas hydrogen sulfide, failed to install required monitoring equipment, and operated for weeks at a time while a key air <mark>pollution</mark> controls were out of service.</P><P>The company <A href=""http://corporate.<mark>arcelormittal</mark>.com/news-and-media/press-releases/archive/2008/aug/04-08-2008?lang=english"">bought the plant</A> in 2008 from Koppers.

Maroz lives downwind of the plant, and says the odors were so bad, she couldn’t sleep.</P><P>“There were times where I would call the plant and complain in the middle of the night and complain about the odors,” she said. “I would call them directly.”</P><P>She also got in touch with DEP, and the agency’s field staff put an air monitoring device at her house, she said. Maroz said she was hopeful the settlement would mean that the plant would clean up, but said she has yet to see any improvement.</P><P>In an emailed statement, the DEP said inspectors had documented more than 120 violations, including for opacity, fugitive dust, bad odor, and other violations.</P><P>PennEnvironment was joined in the settlement by the DEP, EPA and U.S. Department of Justice. The agreement calls for the company to pay a $1.5 million penalty, split between the DEP and EPA.</P><P>In addition, the plant will install <mark>pollution</mark> controls and air monitors. One key part of the plan is the installation of a backup desulfurization unit, which will run while the main desulfurization is off-line for maintenance, Masur said .</P><P>Masur said the age of the plant — it was built in the 1940s — was part of the problem.</P><P>“Because of the old technology and problems at the facility that come with an aged system, and not using best available technology today, they had chronic air <mark>pollution</mark> problems,” Masur said.</P><P>He said the plant had emitted levels of <mark>pollution</mark> as much as eight times the federal limit, leading to Clean Air Act Violations.</P><P>“Those violations add up, there were hundreds and hundreds of them, and it took a lawsuit like this to rein them in,” Masur said.</P><P>On top of the penalty, the company will pay $300,000 to the Community Foundation of Westmoreland County for local air improvements. Phil Koch, executive director of the foundation, said that money will go to initiatives like upgrading the emissions systems of diesel school buses to make them run cleaner.</P><P>The settlement, which is filed with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, will be open for public comment for 30 days.</P><P><I>StateImpact Pennsylvania is a <A href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2017/12/20/coke-plant-agrees-to-1-5-million-penalty-for-air-<mark>pollution</mark>-in-western-pa-community/#more-53073"">collaboration</A> between WESA, Allegheny Front, WITF, and WHYY to cover the commonwealth’s energy economy.

Both were operated by the South African Iron and Steel Corporation (ISCOR) before they were bought up in 2004 by <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>, a company created by the merger of Mittal Steel from India with Arcelor - itself a merger of three companies from France, Luxembourg and Spain.</P><TABLE cellspacing=""5"" cellpadding=""5"" border=""0"" bgcolor=""#99ccff"" align=""right"" vspace=""4"" hspace=""4"" style=""width: 292px;""><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG><SPAN>

The harbour had been subject to the impacts of intensive industrial and urban development around its shores for many years which resulted in nine of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement's ten beneficial use indicators of environmental quality being deemed as impaired. Historically, the economy of the area surrounding Hamilton Harbour was dominated by the steel and iron industry. Today, the harbour remains a major shipping centre and supports one of the largest concentrations of heavy industry in Canada. It also receives the discharge from three wastewater treatments plants, as well as urban runoff from the cities of Hamilton and Burlington. Some sediment in the harbour are contaminated by metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s (PAHs) which were released into the environment by past industrial practices, stretching back over more than a century.</P></DIV><DIV class=""mwsbodytext text parbase section""><H2>What has been accomplished?</H2><P>The Randle Reef cleanup project is a major step in the process to remediate Hamilton Harbour and remove it from the list of AOCs. Randle Reef is an area of highly contaminated sediment located in the southwest corner of Hamilton Harbour. Construction of the Randle Reef Contaminated Sediment Remediation began in 2015. This project will improve water quality, remove current restrictions on navigation and generate economic returns through the creation of valuable port lands. The project will cost $138.9 Million and take seven years to complete. Environment and <mark>Climate Change</mark> Canada, and the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and <mark>Climate Change</mark>, have each committed $46.3 Million, with the final third of funding coming from the City of Hamilton, City of Burlington, Halton Region, Hamilton Port Authority, and U.S. Steel Canada. The cleanup will remediate approximately 695,000 cubic metres of contaminated sediment which will significantly reduce harmful contaminant levels and improve water quality in Hamilton Harbour. The project is currently in Stage One, which involves the construction of the Engineered Containment Facility (ECF) into which the dredged contaminated sediment will be placed.</P><P>An upgrade to the Woodward Avenue Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and the construction of combined sewer overflow tanks have reduced the amount of raw sewage and surface debris entering the harbour and allowed for the opening of local beaches.</P><P>A project to upgrade the Skyway Wastewater Treatment Plant to tertiary treatment was completed in early 2016. The tertiary treatment upgrades to the Woodward and Skyway WWTPs were designed to achieve Hamilton Harbour Remedial Action Plan target for nutrient loading. With 50% of the flows into Hamilton Harbour coming from WWTPs, this work is important to reduce future algae blooms and improve overall water quality.</P><P>Programs have been implemented to return aquatic vegetation to Cootes Paradise Marsh. These include measures to control carp, improve water quality and water clarity. Similar programs are in place for the Grindstone Marsh ecosystem. In addition, fish habitat has been constructed along the western shoreline of the harbour, Bayfront Park, LaSalle Park and the northeastern shoreline. In total, approximately 376 hectares of fish and wildlife habitat and 12 kilometres of shoreline habitat have been restored.</P><P>A shoal has been constructed in the northeast corner of Hamilton Harbour to provide spawning habitat for walleye and smallmouth bass, and to encourage species such as lake herring and whitefish to return to Hamilton Harbour.</P><P>Islands for the nesting of colonial waterbirds have been constructed in the harbour and a 15-hectare wetland has been constructed in Windermere Basin, which includes islands for common tern nesting.</P></DIV><DIV class=""mwsbodytext text parbase section""><H2>What’s left to do?</H2><P>Once the Randle Reef ECF has been constructed, dredging of priority 1 and 2 contaminated sediments (the most highly contaminated sediment) will begin and the dredgate placed into the ECF. After dredging has been completed, the ECF will be capped, and in-situ capping of the lesser contaminated sediment will be undertaken.</P><P>Additional remediation of contaminated sediment at the <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark> Dofasco Boat Slip and the Strathearne boat slip is being investigated, to mitigate high levels of PCBs, PAHs and heavy metals that are a legacy of past industrial processes around the bay.</P><P>Federal, provincial and municipal funding has been secured for further upgrading of the Woodward plant to advanced tertiary treatment and project design engineering is underway with construction targeted for completion by 2021. This will significantly reduce the amount of phosphorus and sediment entering Hamilton Harbour by providing three levels of treatment to wastewater.  </P></DIV><DIV class=""mwsbodytext text parbase section""><H2>Outlook</H2><P>Under the Canada-Ontario Agreement on Great Lakes Water Quality and Ecosystem Health, Canada and Ontario will continue to make significant progress towards remedial action implementation, environmental recovery and restoration of beneficial uses in the Hamilton Harbour AOC. It is anticipated that actions will be completed beyond 2020.</P></DIV><DIV class=""mwsbodytext text parbase section""><H2>Where can you find more information?</H2><UL><LI><A href=""http://www.hamiltonharbour.ca/index.php?page=index&amp;p=about_the_rap"" title=""Link to a resource that is not part of a Government of Canada Web site.

That gas is <mark>CO2</mark>, and when it reacts with peridotite, a rock abundant in the Earth's mantle, it's soaked up, forming a solid <mark>carbon</mark>ate similar to limestone.
                                </P></DIV><P>The Omani peridotite currently absorbs an estimated 10,000 to 100,000 tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide per year, but scientists say that with a little human intervention, it could be sped up to absorb one-eighth of the 38 billion tons of <mark>CO2</mark> emitted through the burning of <A href=""https://phys.org/tags/fossil+fuels/"" rel=""tag"" class=""textTag"">fossil fuels</A> around the world. A greenhouse gas, <mark>CO2</mark> accumulates in the Earth's atmosphere, where it traps heat and raises the global average temperature, fueling extreme weather such as hotter heat waves, more frequent droughts, and more powerful hurricanes. The current concentration of <mark>CO2</mark> is around 400 ppm, the highest it's been in at least the last 800,000 years.</P><P>Although it's just one of the rock types with <mark>CO2</mark>-absorbing properties, and just one method of reducing the impact of <mark>CO2</mark> emissions, peridotite could help mitigate the impending risks posed by <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The pioneers behind the peridotite research, Peter Kelemen and Juerg Matter, geologists at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, discovered peridotite's affinity for consuming <mark>CO2</mark> when they brought it into the lab to determine its age. Realizing that the peridotite had reacted with <mark>CO2</mark> relatively recently, they began to conceptualize what scaling the reaction might look like.</P><P>Although it would be too expensive to move the rock close to power stations where it could soak up emissions, the researchers suggest that <mark>CO2</mark> could be funneled into the Earth's peridotite-laden mantle through a process similar to hydraulic fracturing. This could open up a giant repository for the gas that wouldn't depend on location, but carries with it environmental implications that would need to be taken into careful consideration.</P><P><B>Nature-Driven Solutions</B></P><P>Geologists have long understood that rocks are an important <mark>carbon</mark> sink. Rock weathering happens when <mark>CO2</mark> dissolves in droplets of rainwater, adding the acidity necessary to dissolve the minerals that make up the rock. Rock weathering pulls an estimated one billion tons of <mark>CO2</mark> out of the atmosphere annually.</P><P>&quot;Understanding these natural chemical processes can lead to breakthroughs that allow us to use and expedite processes that reduce <mark>CO2</mark> in the atmosphere,&quot; says Bradley Sageman, professor and chair of earth and planetary sciences at Northwestern. &quot;Methods like these that are standard tech today were considered science fiction in the past. Take the Omani peridotite example. If we could harness that reaction, we've got a potentially transformative mechanism to absorb <mark>CO2</mark> at scale.&quot;</P><P>Some of Sageman's colleagues study the kinetics of weathering reactions to gain a fundamental understanding of the <mark>carbon</mark> cycle—the circular transformation of <mark>carbon</mark> between living things and the environment. Natural users of <mark>CO2</mark> include forests, wetlands, and peat bogs. Scientists have studied these and other <mark>carbon</mark> sinks to develop many artificial processes that produce similar effects.</P><P>Two commonly discussed types of artificial sequestration are ocean storage—pumping <mark>CO2</mark> deep into the ocean—and geologic sequestration—injecting <mark>CO2</mark> deep into depleted oil and gas reservoirs or coal beds that can't be mined. Scientists hesitate to pursue either of these solutions aggressively out of concerns about the stability of disturbed natural systems and the potential effects on ocean life.</P><P>To better understand the dynamics of storage solutions, Sageman and his team look to periods in Earth's history characterized by high levels of atmospheric <mark>CO2</mark> and warming. &quot;A lot of the work we do is to improve our understanding of how the Earth's system behaved during past events of global warming. This should lead to a better framework for discerning what may happen in a future warming world,&quot; he says.</P><P>While the capture and long-term storage of <mark>CO2</mark> suggest some viable solutions to mitigating <mark>CO2</mark>, scientists are also looking at the gas as a resource for creating clean <A href=""https://phys.org/tags/energy/"" rel=""tag"" class=""textTag"">energy</A>. All around the world, researchers are demonstrating that <mark>CO2</mark> can be a key ingredient in many technologies that produce clean, <mark>carbon</mark>-neutral energy.</P><P>Such technologies could complement current fossil <A href=""https://phys.org/tags/fuel/"" rel=""tag"" class=""textTag"">fuel</A>-based systems to lower emissions, and eventually capture <mark>CO2</mark> from the atmosphere to help mitigate <mark>climate change</mark>. Companies big and small—across industries that range from energy to airlines to automotive—are taking notice.</P><P><B>Industrial Strength Solutions</B></P><P>Industry strategists across the board, from small startups to multi-national companies, are looking to define their roles and opportunities in a clean energy future. They're looking for complementary skills, technologies, or technologists who are in the process of developing <mark>innovation</mark>s that are technically feasible, but lack a view towards the market. They know that with risk comes reward, and the pioneers aren't waiting around for the perfect solution to their energy needs; they're working with the brightest technologists to create it.</P><P>Compared to companies in many other industries, utilities are not known to invest heavily in research and development, instead relying on a relatively static knowledge base. Disrupting that status quo, Exelon, the largest regulated utility in the country serving 10 million consumers, is aggressively investing in technologies it can shape into customer-facing products.</P><P>Exelon is investing in many early- and middle-stage projects that complement its services while also reducing its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, including investments in solar energy, fuel cells, and batteries. One example, a company called NetPower, uses <mark>CO2</mark> as a working fluid  to drive a combustion turbine that generates electricity without producing any emissions. The system also produces pipeline-quality <mark>CO2</mark> that can be stored or used in industrial processes, including an enhanced oil recovery process where <mark>CO2</mark> is injected into an oil reservoir to boost output.</P><P>In March 2016, NetPower broke ground on a 50-megawatt demonstration plant in La Porte, Texas, with the goal of operating as efficiently as the best <A href=""https://phys.org/tags/natural+gas+plants/"" rel=""tag"" class=""textTag"">natural gas plants</A> today. Part of a $140 million program, the plant will include ongoing technology advancement,  a full testing and operations program, and commercial product development. Toshiba will provide a supercritical <mark>CO2</mark> turbine and combustor for the project.</P><P>&quot;A lot of people say natural gas is a bridge fuel to lower emissions in the electricity sector, but because most natural gas plants are powered by turbines that rely on a traditional steam cycle, they cannot produce high quality <mark>CO2</mark> that can be repurposed for other things,&quot; says Gould. &quot;On top of that, since NetPower plants don't require steam to drive their turbines, it eliminates water usage as well.&quot;</P><P><B>Fueling Value Creation</B></P><P>Like NetPower, many technology companies have developed processes to help industries reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, and in some cases, make new products in the process. One such company, LanzaTech, is making waves in <mark>carbon</mark> recycling with a proprietary biological process that uses a microbe to convert industrial emissions to useful fuels and chemicals.</P><FIGURE class=""image-block""><FIGCAPTION class=""image-block-caption"">

    </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>&quot;We convert emissions into a variety of new valuable products that would otherwise come from commodity feedstocks,&quot; says Prabhakar Nair, LanzaTech's vice president for business development.</P><P>LanzaTech's process works with a variety of microbes, allowing a customer to specify the desired output—currently either ethanol or butanediol—and take advantage of market conditions.</P><P>After opening two pre-production plants in China, LanzaTech plans to open its first scaled commercial plant in Shanghai in late 2017. The company is also working with the world's largest steel producer, <mark>ArcelorMittal</mark>, to implement a commercial-scale project at its flagship steel mill in Belgium.</P><P>The key to the company's success, according to Nair, lies in the synergy between the technology, industry partners, and product off-takers. Full service at a demo-scale facility includes linking industry partners with buyers for the byproduct that's produced there. For example, LanzaTech has linked steel producers to local refineries that are required by regulation to mix ethanol into their fuel blends.</P><P>&quot;By serving as the bridge between industries that have a feedstock supply and those that have a need, and by doing that with waste emissions, we are putting the circular economy in motion,&quot; says Nair.</P><P>The company recently received $4 million from the US Department of Energy's Bioenergy Technologies Office to design and plan a demonstration-scale facility using industrial off-gases from steel manufacturing to produce three million gallons of low-<mark>carbon</mark> jet and diesel fuels a year. This comes on the heels of a partnership with Virgin Atlantic, which plans a test flight in 2017 using jet fuel made from LanzaTech's proprietary low-<mark>carbon</mark> ethanol. LanzaTech estimates that its technology is compatible with 65 percent of steel mills, and if implemented could produce 15 billion gallons of jet fuel a year, or one-fifth of aviation fuel used around the world.</P><P><B>The Race to the Solar Refinery</B></P><P>Imagine pulling up to the gas station tomorrow, but instead of choosing between unleaded, plus, or diesel, you reach for a highly efficient fuel made only from sunlight, water, and <mark>CO2</mark>.</P><P>These very components that make up this &quot;solar fuel&quot; are the same three things that living plants convert into food. Dubbed &quot;artificial photosynthesis,&quot; at scale this process could jump major hurdles in reducing dependency on fossil fuels.</P><P>With its advantages, it's no wonder that <A href=""https://phys.org/tags/solar+fuels/"" rel=""tag"" class=""textTag"">solar fuels</A> research has taken off around the world—from hubs in Japan and Sweden to the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP) in California, founded by the US Department of Energy in 2010. With a budget of $122 million over five years, JCAP's mission is to build a prototype of a solar fuels system.</P><P>The components of the system envisioned at JCAP are fairly basic. The system requires a photovoltaic material to absorb light energy from the sun, which is then directed at two separate catalysts to lower the energetic hurdle for a reaction. One catalyst splits water into protons and oxygen and the other converts <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and protons into hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s, the main components of fuels. While these processes are currently possible, they still present challenges.</P><P>One is economic. The materials used in both the photovoltaics and catalysts are expensive, including rare materials such as iridium or platinum, which presents a scalability challenge. The other is efficiency. Although ten times more efficient than natural photosynthesis at capturing and converting the sun's energy, the highest recorded efficiency for <A href=""https://phys.org/tags/artificial+photosynthesis/"" rel=""tag"" class=""textTag"">artificial photosynthesis</A> is still only 10 percent. That's less than half the efficiency of silicon panels on the market today.</P><P>So why all the fuss to make energy-dense fuels when we have more efficient renewable technologies available today? Sources of renewable energy, including solar and wind, can only be generated intermittently—when the sun shines or wind blows. Fuels present a viable option for grid-scale energy storage that could compensate for that intermittency and be easily transported to where they're needed.</P><P>The energy density of fuels is also around 100 times greater than that of the highest performing batteries, and many methods of transportation—including cars, ships, and airplanes—already have the infrastructure to run on fuels. And when it comes to mitigating the effects of <A href=""https://phys.org/tags/<mark>climate</mark>+change/"" rel=""tag"" class=""textTag""><mark>climate change</mark></A>, if these fuels were made from <A href=""https://phys.org/tags/<mark>carbon</mark>+dioxide/"" rel=""tag"" class=""textTag""><mark>carbon</mark> dioxide</A> captured from the air, the process would be <mark>carbon</mark>-neutral and would not emit new greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</P><P><B>Collaboration on a Global Scale</B></P><P>Because many questions remain unanswered, JCAP has modified its goal of creating a solar fuels system, instead focusing on getting the fundamentals right. Meanwhile, other scientists carry on a whole system approach.</P><P>That approach will take collaboration and systems engineering, says Michael R. Wasielewski, Clare Hamilton Hall Professor of Chemistry and director of the Argonne-Northwestern Solar Energy Research (ANSER) Center. &quot;Researchers have subsystems that can perform on some baseline level, but when you try to integrate them, it's not seamless and therefore not commercially viable. You need scientists collaborating with engineers to work out the bugs and create a complete working system,&quot; Wasielewski says.</P><P>At ANSER, an Energy Frontier Research Center of the US Department of Energy, Wasielewski works with more than 60 researchers to develop a fundamental understanding of the molecules, materials, and methods required to create significantly more efficient technologies for solar fuels and solar electricity production. In 2013, Wasielewski also founded the Solar Fuels Institute (SOFI).</P><P>SOFI launched a six-phase demonstration project in 2016 with sights set on taking a systems approach to developing solar fuels. At the end of last year, SOFI scientists had successfully produced methanol in the lab at Northwestern. &quot;The SOFI demo project was viewed as a system from the outset,&quot; says Wasielewski. &quot;We're going to need to make this work from one end to the other. But we can't do it alone.&quot;</P><P>As a global consortium, SOFI has university and industry partners from around the world—from academic institutions that span three continents to major multinationals like Shell and Total. Still, SOFI is seeking collaborations from wide-ranging fields, including economics and policy, to work on implementation strategies.</P><P>&quot;Generally speaking,&quot; Wasielewski says, &quot;scientists and engineers can come up with more than one solution to a problem. We can fine-tune a process to be that much more efficient, but we can't know what the priorities are for real-world customers if we don't involve them early on. That's what constitutes a breakthrough technology.&quot;

A steel processing plant with a smaller environmental footprint</H2>
When it acquired a site in São Francisco do Sul in southern Brazil during the early 2000s, Arcelor Mittal – the world’s largest steel producer – was hoping not only to expand its production capacity but also to build a plant that would serve as a model in terms of respect for the environment. The group’s aim was to continue focusing on its chosen field of excellence, steel processing, while joining forces with an international expert in environmental solutions. For this, it chose Veolia.  <H2>A unique approach</H2>
Veolia created CLE Brasil, an ad hoc subsidiary that brings together its full range of expertise in waste, water and energy management, and hired a workforce of 60 employees from the local community to handle its aray of services for Arcelor Mittal. The name CLE is in honor of the first French ship to visit São Francisco do Sul, the Consortium L’Espoir, which landed in 1504. 
Veolia managed the project’s financing and construction and currently operates all of the site’s multi-utility installations (complete water cycle, waste treatment, wastewater treatment, industrial gas, electricity and more) on behalf of Arcelor Mittal. The facility boasts ISO 9001, 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certification. Security issues are also at the heart of Veolia’s operations and the CLE has not reported any accidents since its creation.<STRONG>Régis Hahn, </STRONG>
