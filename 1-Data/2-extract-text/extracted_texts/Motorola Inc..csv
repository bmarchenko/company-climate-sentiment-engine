As <A href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/jim-inhofe-112757.html"">Sen. James Inhofe</A> (R–Okla.) said at that time, in December 2009, he came to Copenhagen to &quot;make sure that nobody is laboring under the misconception that the U.S. Senate is going to do something&quot; about <mark>climate change</mark>. His thinking likely will not change by 2015; in fact, Inhofe has already decried the new U.S.–China <mark>climate</mark> agreement as a &quot;<A href=""http://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-us-china-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-a-non-binding-charade"">nonbinding charade</A>.&quot; 
Even though the U.S. is responsible for the largest share of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the country will not be able to take national legislative action on <mark>climate change</mark> anytime soon. Despite a president who avers that &quot;those who are already feeling the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> don't have time to deny it —they're busy dealing with it,&quot; the U.S. Congress seems content to let <mark>climate change</mark> languish as a priority. National <mark>climate</mark> action is already devolving into a <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/oil-sands-may-irrevocably-tar-the-<mark>climate</mark>/"">fight over approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline</A> that would enable more oil to flow from Canada's tar sands and implementation of the Clean Power Plan, known to some as the “<A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-win-the-war-on-coal-<mark>carbon</mark>-capture-and-storage/"">war on coal</A>.” In fact, the likely new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R–Ky.) was reelected in part based on a platform reduced to a bumper sticker: &quot;Coal. Guns. Freedom.&quot; 
As a result of similar complacency or intransigence around the globe, greenhouse gas <mark>pollution</mark> continues to rise and atmospheric concentrations have now touched <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/report/400-ppm-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">400 parts per million</A>. Australia elected a <mark>climate</mark> skeptic as prime minister who promptly repealed its <mark>carbon</mark> tax—and <mark>pollution</mark> has promptly soared this year. In fact, the world has dawdled long enough that the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> now suggests that technologies to <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/prospects-for-direct-air-capture-of-<mark>carbon</mark>-dioxide/"">remove <mark>CO2</mark> from the atmosphere</A> will be required to prevent too much global warming this century. 
But, believe it or not, action on <mark>climate change</mark> is taking place in the U.S. “We don't have <A href=""https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2013/06/26/obama-has-a-plan-for-<mark>climate</mark>-what-if-it-involves-tar-sands/"">time for a meeting of the Flat Earth Society</A>,&quot; Pres. Barack Obama noted back in June 2013. So his administration has moved forward without Congress as a result, through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan and the new agreement to reduce <mark>pollution</mark> with China. 
Here are seven <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/10-solutions-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">solutions to global warming</A> that are advancing and gathering steam in the U.S.—and around the world. <STRONG>1. Clean Power Plants—</STRONG>More than 20 percent of <A href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=15751"">new, large power plants</A> built in the U.S. in 2013 employ sunlight to generate electricity. And that does not include solar panels on people's rooftops, which alone added nearly two gigawatts of capacity last year. In addition, natural gas replaced coal as the largest source of new electricity generation. The shale revolution enabled the U.S. to reduce its <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions “while maintaining economic growth by switching from coal to gas,&quot; notes Nobuo Tanaka, former head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) and a now a visiting fellow at Columbia University. 
Of the two coal-fired power plants that were completed last year, one was the coal gasification facility in Edwardsport, Ind., which could one day <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-fast-can-<mark>carbon</mark>-capture-and-storage-fix-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">incorporate technology to capture its <mark>CO2</mark></A> emissions. Per megawatt-hour, the new power plant also spews half the <mark>CO2</mark> as the old coal-fired power plant it replaced. 
Although the U.S. is currently <A href=""https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2013/02/05/is-nuclear-power-doomed-to-dwindle/"">retiring more nuclear reactors</A> than it is building, the same is <A href=""http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-A-F/China--Nuclear-Power/"">not true in China</A>. In addition to its 22 operating reactors, it has 26 under construction and plans for even more. That's because the Chinese leadership sees nuclear power as one of the key ways—besides solar, wind and hydropower—to <A href=""https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2013/02/05/is-nuclear-power-doomed-to-dwindle/"">cut down on the country's coal burning</A>, which is responsible both for its choking air <mark>pollution</mark> and swelling greenhouse gas emissions. 
Without nuclear power the IEA and other energy experts suggest that curtailing <mark>climate change</mark> may prove impossible. Regardless, nuclear power today, along with <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/damming-the-yangtze/"">hydropower</A>, provides the bulk of low-<mark>CO2</mark> electricity production. &quot;We need everything,&quot; Tanaka says. &quot;We need CCS [<mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage]. We need nuclear. We need renewables.&quot; <STRONG>2. Local Action—</STRONG>In 2008 six states in the northeastern U.S. launched a <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/<mark>carbon</mark>-dioxide-auction/"">regional effort to cap <mark>CO2</mark></A> <mark>pollution</mark> from power plants in the region via the use of alternative sources and energy-efficiency programs. By 2014, the effort had grown to include nine states and had helped cut such greenhouse gas emissions in nearly half. In fact, the program has been so successful that the states agreed to <A href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=14851"">lower the overall cap</A> by an additional 45 percent starting this year. 
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, aka RGGI, or &quot;Reggie&quot; for short, is not the only <mark>climate</mark> action in the U.S. in the absence of a federal effort. California has launched its own cap-and-trade market, and it has, along with 34 other states, some form of mandate for electricity generated from less polluting sources, such as the wind, sun and Earth's geothermal heat. Cities large (New York) and small (Dubuque, Iowa) have set targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, cities around the world are <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/<mark>climate</mark>-change-will-be-solved-in-cities-or-not-at-all/"">reducing <mark>CO2</mark> in a bid for self-preservation</A>, and some, such as Copenhagen and Melbourne, are aiming to cancel out any <mark>CO2</mark> emitted with <mark>CO2</mark> absorbed or otherwise avoided. 
As a result of these actions—and the surge in generation from cleaner power sources—U.S. greenhouse gas <mark>pollution</mark> has <A href=""http://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/<mark>carbon</mark>/"">dropped by 10 percent since 2005</A>. And the recent election holds out the prospect that RGGI may gain another member state—Pennsylvania. <STRONG>3. Control of Methane Leaks—</STRONG>Colorado has become the first state in the nation to <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fracking-threatens-to-crack-politics/"">try to address methane</A>—a greenhouse gas even more potent than <mark>CO2</mark>. Leaks in pipelines, storage tanks and other infrastructure will have to be fixed within weeks after their discovery, among other new regulations administered by the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission. The Rocky Mountain state is unlikely to remain the only place to act to control such <mark>pollution</mark>. 
In this case even the federal government is taking action. The Obama administration has implemented <A href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/strategy_to_reduce_methane_emissions_2014-03-28_final.pdf"">new rules to capture the methane</A> leaking from garbage dumps, coal mines and the manure piles created by large animal farms. And both the EPA and U.S. Bureau of Land Management are considering rules around methane for the oil and gas industry. At the local level Google has partnered with environmental groups and cities to sniff out leaks in aging gas infrastructure. 
Methane currently accounts for <A href=""http://epa.gov/<mark>climate</mark>change/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html"">9 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas <mark>pollution</mark></A>—and growing because of fracking for oil and the gas itself. In fact, that number does not include all the methane that is flared—that is, burned off as a precaution to prevent explosions but in the process releasing <mark>CO2</mark>. So action against methane can buy more time to address the problem of rising <mark>CO2</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>. <STRONG>4. Tougher Emissions and Efficiency Standards—</STRONG>New standards for cars are becoming a global phenomenon, whether it’s more stringent rules in China, the European Union or the U.S. As the world heads toward <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/china-driving-to-the-future-of-two-billon-cars/"">two billion vehicles</A>, making sure that these cars emit less <mark>pollution</mark>—both smog-forming nitrogen oxides and heat-trapping <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide—will be crucial, whether it is accomplished via more efficient internal combustion engines or better hybrids. Electric cars, including the Chevy Volt, Nissan LEAF or <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tesla-electric-cars-face-challenges-like-fires/"">Tesla Model S</A>, can help, too, provided the electricity does not come from burning fossil fuels. 
At the same time, power plants face ever-tighter requirements for air <mark>pollution</mark>. As a result, U.S. <mark>pollution</mark> is already 10 percent below 2005 levels and will drop lower. &quot;You can't build a coal plant in the U.S. unless it complies with high emission reductions,&quot; says Ethan Zindler, head of policy analysis at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. &quot;People do the low-cost option for compliance, which is to build a new gas plant.&quot; One day <A href=""https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2013/08/27/all-of-the-above-energy-means-more-fracking-renewables-nukes-and-clean-coal/"">even natural gas–fired power plants may have to employ <mark>CO2</mark> capture and storage</A>, much like new coal-fired power plants in Mississippi and Texas do today. 
And new efficiency standards for appliances, from air conditioners to washing machines, have helped keep electricity demand from growing, paired with improvements in basic technology, such as light-emitting diodes, or <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/led-there-be-light/"">LEDs, replacing</A> less efficient incandescent bulbs. <STRONG>5. Greener Farming—</STRONG>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is helping farmers adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>, even if they <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-farmers-do-not-believe-in-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">don't believe in global warming</A>. Regional <mark>climate</mark> hubs now provide extension agents with technical support on best practices to deal with a changing <mark>climate</mark>, including preserving buffer wetlands to cut down on both erosion and flooding. National forests and grasslands will now be managed with the goal of storing <mark>CO2</mark>, among other aims. Already farmers have begun adopting various techniques to reduce greenhouse emissions, including precision agriculture to grow crops efficiently, cover crops to reduce soil erosion and biodigesters to reduce animal waste. 
Ultimately, farms may even help address <mark>climate change</mark> by providing <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/grass-makes-better-ethanol-than-corn/"">energy crops for biofuels</A>. Such fuel from plants paired with the kind of CCS used on coal-fired power plants could even begin to draw down the amount of <mark>CO2</mark> already in the atmosphere. And the regrowth of U.S. forests as less land is devoted to farming is already helping restrain global warming. <STRONG>6. Private Sector Action—</STRONG>It's not just that tech giants like Apple and Google are powering data centers with wind and solar. It's not just big food brands like General Mills and PepsiCo preparing their businesses for the crop and water scarcity predicted by <mark>climate change</mark>. It's not even the internal <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gaming-<mark>carbon</mark>-must-end-to-solve-global-warming/?mobileFormat=true""><mark>carbon</mark> prices</A> employed at oil companies like Shell and even <A href=""http://oilandglory.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/05/01/book_review_steve_colls_private_empire"">ExxonMobil</A>. It's the fact that—outside of coal companies, a few coal-burning utilities and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce—it's hard to find businesses that do not accept the science on global warming or have plans to deal with it. 
The simple fact is that <mark>climate change</mark> also means changes to business models, whether the company is an insurance giant like Swiss Re facing extreme weather risk or a utility, like NRG Energy, facing new regulations as well as customers desirous of a new relationship with power production and producers. And for those in the energy business like Alstom, General Electric, Siemens, Toshiba or Westinghouse, fortunes will be made—or lost—as China and other fast-developing countries build out cleaner energy options. <STRONG>7. New Kinds of Geopolitical Consensus—</STRONG>On November 12 China and the U.S., the world's two most polluting countries, signed an <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-u-s-china-<mark>climate</mark>-change-agreement/"">agreement to combat <mark>climate change</mark></A>. China will cap its <mark>CO2</mark> emissions by 2030 and plan to get 20 percent of its electricity from the wind, sun, dams and fission. The U.S. will ratchet up its <mark>pollution</mark> reduction trajectory aiming for a doubling of the annual rate of decline from just over 1 percent per year to more than 2 percent per year. Combined with the pledge of 28 countries of the European Union to reduce <mark>CO2</mark> as well in the same time frame, more than half of global <mark>pollution</mark> is now set to decline in coming decades. &quot;The politics in both countries are easier if both countries move forward together,&quot; notes Jennifer Morgan, global director of the <mark>climate</mark> program at the World Resources Institute (WRI). &quot;If both are acting together, others cannot hide behind them and they can inspire greater ambition.&quot; 
Nor is the U.S.–China deal the only bright spot, internationally. Brazil and <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/peat-and-repeat-rewetting-<mark>carbon</mark>-sinks/"">Indonesia</A>—the two countries where deforestation is fastest—are both attempting to reverse course. 
At the same time, developing countries are aiming to skip fossil fuels in their drive for prosperity. Kenya has become the world's <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fracking-for-renewable-power-geothermal/"">hotspot for geothermal power</A>, thanks to the Rift Valley, where geology brings hot rocks close to the surface. Both Brazil and India have made big pushes for more solar power. And a recent <A href=""http://global-<mark>climate</mark>scope.org/en/"">survey by Bloomberg New Energy Finance</A> found that 55 developing countries installed nearly twice as much renewable power as developed countries between 2008 and 2013. &quot;If you're burning diesel to light your home, that isn't great,&quot; says Bloomberg's Zindler. &quot;You can now displace that with PV,&quot; or photovoltaics, thanks to the price drop in these cleaner technologies in recent years. 
That's one thing individuals can do: join the <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fight-over-rooftop-solar-forecasts-a-bright-future-for-cleaner-energy/"">growing ranks of solar homeowners</A>. But, at least in the U.S., there is another action that is probably more important to the fight against <mark>climate change</mark> in the long run: voting for politicians and policies that promise <mark>climate</mark> action. As WRI's Morgan notes, to keep the global average temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius by 2100, “the pace and scale of change just needs to increase dramatically.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3><SECTION class=""article-author""><DIV class=""article-author__main""><P class=""article-author__name t_body t_body--article"">David Biello</P><P class=""article-author__desc t_body t_body--article"">David Biello is a contributing editor at <EM>Scientific American</EM>.

But just as ecologist Stephen Pacala and physicist Robert Socolow, both at Princeton University, came up with 15 so-called &quot;<A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;colID=1&amp;articleID=0009E49D-D132-14E5-913283414B7F0000"">wedges</A>&quot; for nations to utilize toward this goal—each of which is challenging but feasible and, in some combination, could <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=3E0F9160-E7F2-99DF-358998AA3C1A910F"">reduce greenhouse gas emissions to safer levels</A>—there are personal lifestyle changes that you can make too that, in some combination, can help reduce your <mark>carbon</mark> impact. Not all are right for everybody. Some you may already be doing or absolutely abhor. But implementing just a few of them could make a difference.</P><P><STRONG>Forego Fossil Fuels</STRONG>—The first challenge is eliminating the <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=BA48EB93-9DCD-A060-1C5154F52D5D2D18"">burning of coal</A>, oil and, eventually, natural gas. This is perhaps the most daunting challenge as denizens of richer nations literally eat, wear, work, play and even sleep on the products made from such fossilized sunshine. And citizens of developing nations want and arguably deserve the same comforts, which are largely thanks to the energy stored in such fuels.</P><P>Oil is the lubricant of the global economy, hidden inside such ubiquitous items as plastic and corn, and fundamental to the transportation of both consumers and goods. Coal is the substrate, <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=6DB6EF35-E7F2-99DF-3EC5491903FC2A34"">supplying roughly half of the electricity</A> used in the U.S. and nearly that much worldwide—a percentage that is likely to grow, according to the International Energy Agency. There are no perfect solutions for reducing dependence on fossil fuels (for example, <mark>carbon</mark> neutral biofuels can drive up the price of food and lead to forest destruction, and while <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=43D0C499-E7F2-99DF-30F52701AD131FD0"">nuclear power</A> does not emit greenhouse gases, it does produce radioactive waste), but every bit counts.</P><P>So try to employ alternatives when possible—plant-derived plastics, biodiesel, wind power—and to invest in the change, be it by divesting from oil stocks or investing in companies practicing <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage.</P><P><STRONG>Infrastructure Upgrade</STRONG>—Buildings worldwide contribute around one third of all greenhouse gas emissions (43 percent in the U.S. alone), even though <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=A0671BA9-E7F2-99DF-35F0BAD21FF6E5CE"">investing in thicker insulation</A> and other cost-effective, temperature-regulating steps can save money in the long run. Electric grids are at capacity or overloaded, but power demands continue to rise. And bad roads can lower the fuel economy of even the most efficient vehicle. Investing in new infrastructure, or radically upgrading existing highways and transmission lines, would help cut greenhouse gas emissions and drive economic growth in developing countries.</P><P>Of course, it takes a lot of cement, a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, to construct new buildings and roads. The U.S. alone contributed 50.7 million metric tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide to the atmosphere in 2005 from cement production, which requires heating limestone and other ingredients to 1,450 degrees Celsius (2,642 degrees Fahrenheit). Mining copper and other elements needed for electrical wiring and transmission also causes globe-warming <mark>pollution</mark>.</P><P>But energy-efficient buildings and <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=7D0F7914-E7F2-99DF-324A350B33629F97"">improved cement-making processes</A> (such as using alternative fuels to fire up the kiln) could reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the developed world and prevent them in the developing world.</P><P><STRONG>Move Closer to Work</STRONG>—Transportation is the second leading source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. (burning a single gallon of gasoline produces 20 pounds of CO<SUB>2</SUB>). But it doesn't have to be that way.</P><P>One way to dramatically curtail transportation fuel needs is to move closer to work, use mass transit, or switch to walking, <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleid=778EF0AB-E7F2-99DF-3594A60E4D9A76B2"">cycling</A> or some other mode of transport that does not require anything other than human energy. There is also the option of working from home and telecommuting several days a week.</P><P>Cutting down on long-distance travel would also help, most notably airplane flights, which are one of the fastest growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions and a source that arguably releases such emissions in the worst possible spot (higher in the atmosphere). Flights are also one of the few sources of globe-warming <mark>pollution</mark> for which there isn't already a viable alternative: jets rely on kerosene, because it packs the most energy per pound, allowing them to travel far and fast, yet it takes roughly 10 gallons of oil to make one gallon of JetA fuel. Restricting flying to only critical, long-distance trips—in many parts of the world, trains can replace planes for short- to medium-distance trips—would help curb airplane emissions.</P><P><STRONG>Consume Less</STRONG>—The easiest way to cut back on greenhouse gas emissions is simply to buy less stuff. Whether by forgoing an automobile or employing a reusable grocery sack, cutting back on consumption results in fewer fossil fuels being burned to extract, produce and ship products around the globe.</P><P>Think green when making purchases. For instance, if you are in the market for a new car, buy one that will last the longest and have the least impact on the environment. Thus, a used vehicle with a hybrid engine offers superior fuel efficiency over the long haul while saving the environmental impact of new car manufacture.</P><P>Paradoxically, when purchasing essentials, such as groceries, buying in bulk can reduce the amount of packaging—plastic wrapping, cardboard boxes and other unnecessary materials. Sometimes buying more means consuming less.</P><P><STRONG>Be Efficient</STRONG>—A potentially simpler and even bigger impact can be made by doing more with less. Citizens of many developed countries are profligate wasters of energy, whether by speeding in a gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicle or leaving the lights on when not in a room.</P><P>Good driving—and good car maintenance, such as making sure tires are properly inflated—can limit the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from a vehicle and, perhaps more importantly, lower the frequency of payment at the pump.</P><P>Similarly, employing more efficient refrigerators, air conditioners and other appliances, such as those rated highly under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star program, can cut electric bills while something as simple as weatherproofing the windows of a home can reduce heating and cooling bills. Such efforts can also be usefully employed at work, whether that means installing more efficient turbines at the power plant or <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=AFA9164F-E7F2-99DF-30014E56F3AC8BD9"">turning the lights off when you leave the office</A>.</P><P><STRONG>Eat Smart, Go Vegetarian?</STRONG>—Corn grown in the U.S. requires barrels of oil for the fertilizer to grow it and the diesel fuel to harvest and transport it. Some grocery stores stock organic produce that do not require such fertilizers, but it is often shipped from halfway across the globe. And meat, whether beef, chicken or pork, requires pounds of feed to produce a pound of protein.</P><P>Choosing food items that balance nutrition, taste and ecological impact is no easy task. Foodstuffs often bear some nutritional information, but there is little to reveal how far a head of lettuce, for example, has traveled.</P><P>University of Chicago researchers estimate that each meat-eating American produces 1.5 tons more greenhouse gases through their food choice than do their vegetarian peers. It would also take <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=C4B62D71-E7F2-99DF-3C3B53587E1B5AC2"">far less land to grow the crops</A> necessary to feed humans than livestock, allowing more room for planting trees.</P><P><STRONG>Stop Cutting Down Trees</STRONG>—Every year, 33 million <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=C4B62D71-E7F2-99DF-3C3B53587E1B5AC2"">acres of forests are cut down</A>. Timber harvesting in the tropics alone contributes 1.5 billion metric tons of <mark>carbon</mark> to the atmosphere. That represents 20 percent of human-made greenhouse gas emissions and a source that could be avoided relatively easily.</P><P>Improved agricultural practices along with paper recycling and forest management—balancing the amount of wood taken out with the amount of new trees growing—could quickly eliminate this significant chunk of emissions.</P><P>And when purchasing wood products, such as furniture or flooring, buy used goods or, failing that, wood certified to have been sustainably harvested. The Amazon and other forests are not just the lungs of the earth, they may also be humanity's best short-term hope for limiting <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>Unplug</STRONG>—Believe it or not, U.S. citizens spend more money on electricity to power devices when off than when on. Televisions, stereo equipment, computers, battery chargers and a host of other gadgets and appliances consume more energy when seemingly switched off, so unplug them instead.</P><P>Purchasing energy-efficient gadgets can also save both energy and money—and thus prevent more greenhouse gas emissions. To take but one example, efficient battery chargers could save more than one billion kilowatt-hours of electricity—$100 million at today's electricity prices—and thus prevent the release of more than one million metric tons of greenhouse gases.</P><P>Swapping old incandescent lightbulbs for more efficient replacements, such as compact fluorescents (warning: these lightbulbs contain mercury and must be properly disposed of at the end of their long life), would save billions of kilowatt-hours. In fact, according to the EPA, replacing just one incandescent lightbulb in every American home would save enough energy to provide electricity to three million American homes.</P><P><STRONG>One Child</STRONG>—There are at least 6.6 billion people living today, a number that is predicted by the United Nations to grow to at least nine billion by mid-century. The U.N. Environmental Program estimates that it requires <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=DEAF205F-E7F2-99DF-35C3B60FE3CC788B"">54 acres to sustain an average human being</A> today—food, clothing and other resources extracted from the planet. Continuing such population growth seems un<mark>sustainable</mark>.</P><P>Falling birth rates in some developed and developing countries (a significant portion of which are due to government-imposed limits on the number of children a couple can have) have begun to reduce or reverse the population explosion. It remains unclear how many people the planet can comfortably sustain, but it is clear that per capita energy consumption must go down if <mark>climate change</mark> is to be controlled.</P><P>Ultimately, a one child per couple rule is not <mark>sustainable</mark> either and there is no perfect number for human population. But it is clear that more humans means more greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P><STRONG>Future Fuels</STRONG>—Replacing fossil fuels may prove the great challenge of the 21st century. Many contenders exist, ranging from <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=07520EDF-E7F2-99DF-3F39F759D467DFCD"">ethanol derived from crops</A> to hydrogen electrolyzed out of water, but all of them have some drawbacks, too, and none are immediately available at the scale needed.</P><P>Biofuels can have a host of negative impacts, from driving up food prices to sucking up more energy than they produce. Hydrogen must be created, requiring either reforming natural gas or electricity to crack water molecules. Biodiesel hybrid <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=EE568144-E7F2-99DF-313C5C52D14CAD32"">electric vehicles</A> (that can plug into the grid overnight) may offer the best transportation solution in the short term, given the energy density of diesel and the <mark>carbon</mark> neutral ramifications of fuel from plants as well as the emissions of electric engines. A recent study found that the present amount of electricity generation in the U.S. could provide enough energy for the country's entire fleet of automobiles to <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleID=7DAAAE1A-E7F2-99DF-3C7E9BECAAA68E5F"">switch to plug-in hybrids</A>, reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the process.</P><P>But plug-in hybrids would still rely on electricity, now predominantly generated by burning dirty coal. Massive investment in low-emission energy generation, whether <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=1FC8E87E-E7F2-99DF-3253ADDFDBEC8D41"">solar-thermal power</A> or <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=43D0C499-E7F2-99DF-30F52701AD131FD0"">nuclear fission</A>, would be required to radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And even more speculative energy sources—hyperefficient photovoltaic cells, solar energy stations in orbit or even fusion—may ultimately be required.</P><P>The solutions above offer the outline of a plan to personally avoid contributing to global warming. But should such individual and national efforts fail, there is another, potentially desperate solution:</P><P><STRONG>Experiment Earth</STRONG>—<mark>Climate change</mark> represents humanity's first planetwide experiment. But, if all else fails, it may not be the last. So-called <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=FCF8F6B9-E7F2-99DF-33CA7D5B2579D36C"">geoengineering</A>, radical interventions to either block sunlight or reduce greenhouse gases, is a potential last resort for addressing the challenge of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Among the ideas: releasing sulfate particles in the air to mimic the cooling effects of a massive volcanic eruption; placing millions of small mirrors or lenses in space to deflect sunlight; covering portions of the planet with reflective films to bounce sunlight back into space; <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=FAF364ED-E7F2-99DF-345948AA1B72AEFF"">fertilizing the oceans with iron</A> or other nutrients to enable plankton to absorb more <mark>carbon</mark>; and increasing cloud cover or the reflectivity of clouds that already form.</P><P>All may have unintended consequences, making the solution worse than the original problem. But it is clear that at least some form of geoengineering will likely be required: <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleId=4D9BFC3D-E7F2-99DF-3E6E1A60C23D44E6"">capturing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide</A> before it is released and storing it in some fashion, either deep beneath the earth, at the bottom of the ocean or in <mark>carbon</mark>ate minerals. Such <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage is critical to any serious effort to combat <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P><EM>Additional reporting by Larry Greenemeier and Nikhil Swaminathan</EM>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3><SECTION class=""article-author""><DIV class=""article-author__main""><P class=""article-author__name t_body t_body--article"">David Biello</P><P class=""article-author__desc t_body t_body--article"">David Biello is a contributing editor at <EM>Scientific American</EM>.

Coats North America Consolidated, Inc.</EM> (Connecticut Superior Court 2005-present).  Since the early 1980s, Moore &amp; Van Allen has represented the former owner of one of the earliest textile mills in the United States in a series of administrative proceedings and litigation involving groundwater contamination and other environmental issues at a textile mill complex in Willamantic, Connecticut.  In 1987, on behalf of our client, we obtained a release from further environmental liability from the Commonwealth of Connecticut.  The current owner of the property is now seeking damages for the effect of the remaining contamination on the value of the property.  We obtained summary judgment on behalf of our client from the trial court and the decision was appealed.  The case was argued by Peter McGrath before the Connecticut Supreme Court on September 7, 2007. </LI><LI><EM>USRP v. Langston</EM> ( U.S. District Court, Eastern District of North Carolina 2004-2007).  Represented the owner of property leased to a convenience store operator.  We obtained summary judgment for our client for the cost of cleaning up the UST contamination and the judgment was upheld by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in an unpublished per curium decision (No. 06-1528).</LI><LI><EM>U.S.</EM><EM> v. Martin Marietta Materials, et al.</EM>  ( U. S. District Court, Eastern District of North Carolina, 2005-2006).  Defended Martin Marietta Materials in CERCLA cost recovery action relating to the Reasor Chemical Site.</LI><LI><EM>South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control v. Western Atlas, Inc. et al.</EM> (United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, Columbia Division, 2000-2005).  Represented a supplier and recycler of industrial solvents and a transporter of hazardous wastes that has allegedly contributed to groundwater contamination.  This is a CERCLA enforcement action that seeks to hold five defendants jointly and severally liable for past and future government-incurred response costs and natural resources damages.</LI><LI><EM>Shalub, et al. v. Amoco, et al. </EM> (Rebozo Trust case) ( United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida 2000-2001).  Represented BP in a groundwater contamination case brought by the trustees of the Rebozo trust for cleanup costs and property damages resulting from releases from USTs at former Amoco service station on Key Biscayne. </LI><LI><EM>Sherrill, et al. v. Amerada Hess, et al.</EM> (N.C. Superior Court 1995-2005).  Peter McGrath and others defended twelve oil company defendants in a putative class action litigation filed by residents located within two miles of the Paw Creek petroleum terminals.  The plaintiffs alleged that they had incurred medical problems and property devaluation as a result of air emissions (primarily benzene), discharges to creeks, and groundwater contamination.  Class certification was defeated and the case was ultimately resolved with approximately 450 local residents.  </LI><LI><EM>Maynard, et al. v. Amerada Hess, et al. </EM>(N.C. Superior Court 1999-2002).  David Fox and Peter McGrath represented several petroleum company defendants in putative MTBE class action litigation.  The putative class consisted of approximately 900,000 well owners.  Class certification was defeated and the case was settled.  </LI><LI><EM>United States and States of Alabama, Arkansas, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas and Utah v. Nucor Corporation</EM> (U. S. District Court, District of South Carolina, July 1, 2001).  Represented Nucor Corporation in negotiating comprehensive consent decree to resolve alleged violations of Clean Air Act, RCRA, Clean Water Act and EPCRA at eight steel mills and six other operating facilities in eight states.</LI><LI><EM>B.F. Goodrich, et al. v. PMC, Inc., et al. </EM>(United States District Court for the District of South Carolina 1999-2001).  Private party groundwater litigation to recover cleanup costs at a chemical manufacturing site in South Carolina.  Represented one of the former operators of the business and our client settled on the eve of trial for less than the cost of taking the case through trial.</LI><LI><EM>Lord Corporation v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Company, Marathon Oil Company and Ashland Oil Company</EM> (U.S. District Court, District of Kentucky, Bowling Green Division, 1998).  Represented plaintiff in CERCLA contribution action against prior owners of real estate.</LI><LI><EM>Castles Auto &amp; Truck Service, Inc. v. Exxon</EM> (U.S. District Court, Western District of North Carolina 1990-1998).  Represented Exxon in litigation relating to alleged groundwater contamination at its Paw Creek terminal.  The case was tried before a jury, a defense judgment was entered by the court, the case was appealed to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, and ultimately the case was settled.</LI><LI><EM>Ashcraft, et al v. Conoco </EM>(United States District Court, Eastern District of North Carolina 1994-1997).  The case involved the claims of about 177 plaintiffs for damages (including health injuries, medical monitoring and property devaluation) relating to alleged contamination from a former service station.  The case was tried for five weeks to a jury in August of 1997, but was settled before the jury reached a verdict.</LI><LI><EM>Diane Lofgren, et al. v. Motorola, et al.</EM> (Arizona Superior Court 1993-1997), and Melody L. Baker, et al. v. Motorola, et al. (Arizona Superior Court 1992-1997).  David Fox represented an industrial defendant that was alleged to have contributed to groundwater contamination at one of several sites at issue in the litigation.  Damages sought against the firm’s client were in the $100's of millions.  That client’s liability was resolved in five-week arbitration.</LI><LI><EM>Little v. Petroleum World </EM>(N.C. Superior Court 1994-1995).  Represented a petroleum jobber that was the owner of underground storage tanks at a convenience store near Hickory, North Carolina.  The plaintiff sought to recover property devaluation damages and cleanup costs.  The court granted summary judgment in favor of our client.</LI><LI><EM>Culbertson v. Coats American</EM> (United States District Court, Northern District of Georgia, 1994-1995).  Peter McGrath successfully defended a citizen suit against our client.</LI><LI><EM>Strum v. Exxon</EM> (United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina 1992-1994).  Represented Exxon against claims of groundwater contamination from a former service station site.  We obtained summary judgment on a novel theory of law, and the decision was ultimately upheld by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. <EM>Strum v. Exxon</EM>, 15 F.3d 327 (4th Cir. 1994).</LI><LI><EM>Palant v. Exxon</EM> (United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida 1991-1994).  Represented Exxon in an action for alleged property devaluation and cleanup costs for a former gas station in Broward County, Florida.  The case was resolved after entry of partial summary judgment.</LI><LI><EM>U.S.</EM><EM> v. Abbott Laboratories </EM>(Aquatech Environmental Superfund Site) (United States District Court, Western Division of  South Carolina 1989-1995).  In this CERCLA cost recovery action, we represented several of the major PRPs and served on the PRP Steering Committee for the site.  The case was ultimately settled.</LI><LI><EM>Southern Bell</EM><EM> v. City of </EM><EM>Charlotte</EM> (N.C. Superior Court, 1986-1987).  We filed an action against the City of Charlotte of contamination of an underground fiber optic conduit by a former landfill operated by the City.  The City ultimately paid all of Southern Bell’s costs after discovery produced information that would have allowed Southern Bell to defeat claims of sovereign immunity and possibly recover punitive damages.</LI><LI><EM>Pipkin, et al. v. Union Oil Company, et al. </EM> (N.C. Superior Court 1984-1988).  Represented Union Oil Company in one of the first (if not the first) UST mass tort actions in North Carolina.  The case was brought as a putative class action relating to alleged contamination of a minority community located near a former truck stop in eastern North Carolina.  The case involved what would later be referred to as environmental justice claims.  Class certification was defeated, and the case was settled.</LI></UL><H3 class=""defaultHeader"">news</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

But, we'd been building phones for years and years in cars, and we [Motorola] thought the time was ready for personal communication, 'cause people are just naturally mobile. </P><P>For 100 years, people wanting to talk on the phone have been constrained by being tied to their desks or their homes with a wire, and now we're going to trap them in their cars? That's not good. </P><P>So we decided to take on AT&amp;T. By 1973, we decided to put on a dazzling presentation, and I decided the best way to do that was to build a phone and have someone actually have the experience of talking on a real personal handheld telephone. And that was the genesis of that phone that we built.</P><P><B>When did you make that first phone call? Who was it to?</B></P><P>I thought everybody knew the answer to that question! The first public call was made out on the streets of New York. It was to [Joel S. Engel], the head of the cellular program at AT&amp;T. I called and told him, &quot;Joel, I'm calling you from a cellular phone, a real cellular phone, a handheld, portable, real cellular phone.&quot;</P><P>I don't remember exactly what he said, but it was really quiet for a while. My assumption was that he was grinding his teeth. He was very polite and ended the call. When asked about it, he says he has no recollection of this moment.</P><P><B>What were the reactions to the cell phone like? Did people think it was unbelievable, impossible, unnecessary?</B></P><P>Well, people were dazzled by the concept! It was beyond imagination that more than half the people in the world would have these phones. But people were absolutely amazed by the fact that you could hold the phone up to your ear, walk around and make a phone call.</P><P>Remember, there were not even any cordless phones at that time. We had a press conference [in 1973], and I handed the phone to this young lady journalist and told her to make a phone call. And she said, &quot;Can I call my mother in Australia?&quot; and I said, &quot;Sure!&quot; And she did that. </P><P>This woman was just spellbound, she couldn't imagine how this little phone could reach more than halfway around the world, and talk to her mother who actually answered the phone. Sophisticated New Yorkers were standing there with their mouths open.</P><P>The reception was quite extraordinary.The chairman of our company happened to be in Washington the time we did the next demonstration [in the early 1980s]. He visited with the vice president ... [George H.W. Bush] ... and showed him this new phone, and he was so taken by the phone.</P><P>He said, &quot;Well, I have to show this to Ron.&quot; And the next thing you know he was showing it to Ronald Reagan. And Reagan asks, &quot;What's keeping us from having this?&quot;</P><P><B>What did the phone look like? How much did it cost and who actually bought it?</B></P><P>The phone [was] about 10 or 11 inches high, about 1 1/2 inches across, and about 4 inches deep. It weighed about 2 1/2 pounds.</P><P><B>How much did it cost?</B></P><P>If you think about it, this is not a commercial product and if you had to build one it would cost about a million dollars. By the time we built a commercial product, it was 10 years later. We didn't sell that product until October of 1983, and the phone then cost $3,900. So that would be like buying a phone today for $10,000. </P><P><B>That's quite a lot of money. Who actually bought these phones?</B></P><P>Well, I wouldn't say it was large number of people; in fact it was a very small number. In the beginning it was wealthy people, but also people who had to be on the move. It was for people like real estate agents and doctors, who were already more accustomed to technology because they were using pagers.</P><P>Cell phones didn't really get to be a big deal til about another seven or eight years later. Everybody thinks that the cell phone has always been here and that it's always been popular, but it wasn't until 1990 -- before there were as few as a million cell phones in the world -- that's where it started to really explode.</P><P><B>Did you ever think the phone would ever be available to everyone?</B></P><P>Well, we knew that someday everybody would have a [cell] phone, but it was hard to imagine that that would happen in my lifetime. And now we've got almost five billion phones in the world. Wow.</P><P><B>How do you feel about the advancements cell phones have made, especially with features like apps and cameras, etc.?</B></P><P>I must tell you as much as we were dreamers, we never imagined that all these things could be combined into one, and I'm really not so sure that it's a great thing. Phones have gotten so complicated, so hard to use, that you wonder if this is designed for real people or for engineers. </P><P>I think what's really going to happen is we're going to have a lot of different kinds of phones when our industry grows up -- some that are just plain, simple telephones. In fact, my wife and I started a company, and she designed the Jitterbug, which is just a simple telephone.</P><P><B>What kind of phone do you have now?</B></P><P>I'm sitting here looking at all of my phones. I'm talking to you on a phone I'm trying out for a company in Europe. It's called the Vertu, and this phone starts at $5,000. And that's for the very cheap model. You could buy a solid-gold version of this phone.</P><P><B>So this phone, even with inflation, costs about half as much as your first cell phone.</B></P><P>Yep, and really this phone is not a really complicated phone. It does have a phonebook in it, it does reach certain parts of the Web, but it's not a PDA. You can't read e-mail on it; it doesn't have a camera on it. It really is a basic telephone.</P><P class=""cnnInline"">I also have a Droid. I got a Motorola Droid that I use. I also have a Jitterbug. I'm always trying whatever the latest telephone is. I had an iPhone for a while, I gave that to my grandson. Kids are really caught up in that. But I think that the Android phones are catching up now, and the latest version of the Android phones are every bit as good, if not better, than the iPhone.</P><DIV class=""cnn_strybtntoolsbttm""><DIV class=""cnn_strybtntools""><DIV class=""cnn_strybtntoolsBot""><DIV class=""cnnOverlayMenuContainer""><DIV id=""cnnShareThisStory456"" class=""cnnOverlayMenu""><DIV class=""cnnShareThisBox""><DIV class=""cnnShareBoxContent""><DIV class=""cnnShareContent""><DIV id=""cnnShareThisContent""><DIV class=""cnnShareThisTitle""><H6>Share this on:</H6></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
