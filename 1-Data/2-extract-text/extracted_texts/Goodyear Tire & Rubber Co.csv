Cisco’s Global Center for Digital Business Transformation in a 2015 survey of nearly 1,000 executives found 15 percent said digital disruption was already occurring in their respective industries. At the same time, a scant one in 250 of those surveyed said digital trends would have a transformative impact on their industry.

In 2015, a quarter of those surveyed said they were “actively responding” to digital disruption. That number rose to just 31 percent this year.</P><P>“That is a dangerous game to play,” Aston said.</P><FIGURE id=""attachment_2162"" style=""width: 300px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Drive Capital’s Mark Kvamme</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>While the media/entertainment trades and Cisco’s own technology products and services niche are easily most vulnerable to disruption, few – if any – parts of the economy are immune to companies born in today’s digital-first world. Speaker Mark Kvamme, a former Ohio economic development official and partner at venture capital investment firm Drive Capital, shared a dynamic portrait of “born digital” companies in Drive’s investment portfolio. One of them, Columbus-based startup <A href=""https://crosschx.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">CrossChx</A>, has launched an artificial intelligence-enabled tool for the health-care industry that synthesizes and automates high-volume, repetitive tasks — prior authorizations, appointment reminders — outside the scope of patient care. On the analytics front, Columbus-based FactGem — run by Megan Kvamme — is helping companies translate hordes of data from far-flung sources into actionable intelligence.</P><P>All these <mark>innovation</mark>s, Kvamme said, point to an unavoidable truth: “The amount of change we’re going to see in the next five to 10 years is going to spin everybody’s heads.”</P><P>A world of opportunity, however, also means a world of risk. Professor Dennis Hirsch, who runs the <A href=""http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/data-and-governance/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Program on Data and Governance</A> at Ohio State’s Moritz College of Law, closed out the session with a look at the tricky terrain of data analytics in technology, which already has destroyed some players (student data repository InBloom) and led to serious brand damage for others (Uber).</P><P>“Big data is a crystal ball,” Hirsch said, “and that means it can be used for good — and for bad.”</P><P>As companies move forward, Hirsch said, it’ll be incumbent upon them to establish processes and guiding values that protect customers and treat them fairly. Technology and its innovative uses for data, in fact, are outrunning the law itself.</P><P>“The law hasn’t caught up, and to some extent it never will,” Hirsch said. “We need to be asking, ‘What does it mean to be responsible beyond just compliance?’”</P><P>A key tool companies can use as they make decisions on these issues, and the broader world of digital transformation, is a decidedly non-technological notion at heart: process. From a legal and ethical perspective, that means establishing them on the front end to mitigate the risks of leveraging big data. From a business agility standpoint, Aston of Cisco said in opening the day, that means having a perspective that extends beyond the flashy <mark>innovation</mark> itself.</P><P>“We have to make thoughtful decisions,” Aston said, “and we can’t just be focused on technological outcomes. What’s the business outcome you need to drive?”</P></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

A new type of cotton grew on a sun-drenched field in the Gila Indian Community. Outstandingly durable, this cotton would dominate Arizona’s economy during World War I and change the cotton industry forever.</P><H3>Cotton Quality</H3><P>In many ways, cotton is truly the fabric of our lives. This fiber, used to make jeans, underwear, dresses, towels, and bed linen, once reinforced tires, airplane wing covers, and industrial machinery. </P><P>Not all cotton is created equal. The length of the fibers of the fluffy bud of the cotton plant determine the quality of the finished product. A cotton bud with fibers about one inch long is short staple cotton—fine for all purpose use. The last decades of the 1800s saw the rise of Egyptian long staple cotton. Grown in the hot, dry <mark>climate</mark>s of Egypt, its longer fibers added durability and a soft, silky feel to fabrics. High end manufacturers coveted Egyptian cotton’s long fibers over the homegrown short staple varieties, and in a short time, Egyptian cotton had made a name for itself. Industry, too, favored Egyptian cotton for the durability its long fibers provided. American growers tried to domestically cultivate several versions of long staple cotton. Pima cotton is a result of these efforts.</P><P>Pima cotton is extra long staple (ELS) cotton. By law, ELS cotton fibers at least 3/8 inch longer than short staple cotton. Today’s Pima cotton crop can top out somewhere around an inch and a half, making it the longest cotton in the world. It can make a material more closely resembling satin than denim. A material made with Supima cotton, the brand name for premium Pima cotton, in outstanding in its silky smoothness.</P><H3>A Genetic Breakthrough</H3><P>In the late 1800s, American crop growers formed a hybrid crop from American and Egyptian cotton varieties. It did well enough among pockets of experienced cotton growers of Georgia’s Sea Islands—until the boll weevil decimated the industry to the point where it virtually disappeared around 1920.</P><P>Meanwhile, growers turned to the hot, dry southwest, theorizing that the <mark>climate</mark> mirrored Egypt’s and hybrid plants would grow better. Smack in the center of the Arizona Territory, federal agricultural engineers began tinkering to produce a cotton unseen by the world.  At an experimental farm in Sacaton, Pima Indians cultivated cotton hybrids until ideal traits were achieved. In the early 1900s, the scientist Thomas Kearney created a plant that grew well in <A href=""/land/az-habitats"">hot <mark>climate</mark>s with cool nights</A> and produced long, silky fibers for a soft, dense cloth. This long staple cotton was named Pima after the Pima Indians who grew it, and released into the market in 1910.</P><H3>Goodyear and the Cotton Boom</H3><P>Back then, long staple cotton wasn’t needed for sheets or luxury blouses. It was grown for its toughness—tough enough for industrial use in airplane wing covers and tires. In fact, cotton was a primary component of tires. That’s why Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company purchased 16,000 acres of Salt River Valley land in 1917, the same year mine bosses <A href=""/remember/featured-exhibit-minerals#quicktabs-featured_exhibit_100_years_of_ar=3"">arrested striking miners</A> in Bisbee and Jerome.</P><P>World War I was escalating, and Goodyear’s foreign suppliers could not meet demand. Meanwhile, Goodyear needed that cotton to make airplane tires for airships. So Goodyear junior executive Paul Litchfield purchased land and the company moved to the Arizona Territory to cultivate Pima cotton. It opened a factory next to the farms. Other manufacturers, like Firestone and Dunlop, followed suit, and by 1920 cotton was by far Arizona’s most popular crop. Alfalfa fields were sewn with cotton seed and <A href=""/land/cattle-ranching"">rangelands</A> cultivated. The crop covered about 800,000 acres.</P><P>Shortly after the war, demand dried up. Government contracts for cotton airplane wing covers evaporated, and tire production dropped. Many of Arizona’s independent cotton farmers were left high and dry. Some weathered the market drought, and some didn’t. But Arizona has never again grown that much cotton.</P><H3>The Supima Brand</H3><P>As rubbers and petroleum products replaced industrial cotton, overall demand for Pima cotton fell. In 1954, its farmers branded it with the term Supima (a combination the words of “Superior” and “Pima”) and formed the Supima Association to cultivate its market as a luxury good. Its obvious quality won the hearts of several prominent clothing designers, especially those interested in using a product grown on U.S. soil. Slowly, Supima cotton is fighting its way into the public’s mind as the best cotton money can buy.</P><P>By 1980, total cotton production in Arizona (both Pima and short staple) had floated back up to cover 600,000 acres of <A href=""/land/farming-and-ranching"">agricultural land</A>. In 1987, Arizona was supplying 66% of the nation’s Pima cotton.</P><P>But Pima cotton is not simple to cultivate. One crop takes about nine months to grow. In a volatile market, that much of a time investment is always a risk. Pima cotton also seems hard hit by a changing <mark>climate</mark>. The concrete jungles of Maricopa and Pinal counties are holding heat that disagrees with the temperamental crop.</P><P>Today, Arizona supplies just 2% of the nation’s Pima cotton. Supima cotton is only grown in America, and primarily in the southwest. A purchase of clothes or linens labeled with Supima cotton supports the national economy, because the product is likely to be domestically produced.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""group-right color-bg""><DIV class=""field field-name-field-related-content-by-theme field-type-viewfield field-label-hidden""><DIV class=""field-items""><DIV class=""field-item even""><DIV class=""view view-related-content-lists view-id-related_content_lists view-display-id-entity_view_1 hide-related view-dom-id-70f13d8100c9de74e71d41fa85b77b5e""><DIV class=""view-header""><H4 style=""margin-left:5px; margin-bottom:10px; padding-bottom:0px;"">Most Popular Related Articles</H4></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Every year, there are roughly 11,000 tire-related vehicle crashes in the U.S. Many of these crashes can be prevented through proper tire maintenance—including tire inflation, balance, alignment, and rotation—and understanding tire labels, aging, recalls and complaints. Meanwhile, 232 million passenger cars and light trucks in the U.S. consume about 134 billion gallons of fuel each year.</P><P>Making smart consumer choices when purchasing tires and maintaining tires properly can cut fuel use and save money at the pump, reducing the <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> that causes <mark>climate change</mark>.  In fact, by enabling a driver to travel farther on a gallon of fuel, proper tire maintenance combined with the use of low rolling resistance tires could save a driver up to $80 per year, and avoid up to 560 pounds of annual <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide <mark>pollution</mark>, equivalent to nearly 600 miles of emission-free driving.</P><P>Keeping tires properly inflated and choosing low-rolling resistant tires can have a national impact. If 10 million drivers kept their tires properly inflated, they could save nearly $500 million dollars and 1.6 million metric tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide <mark>pollution</mark> a year. And if just 10 percent of consumers buying aftermarket tires bought tires that were 10 percent more efficient, the annual savings would be more than $200 million and 690,000 metric tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide <mark>pollution</mark>.</P><P>To minimize the number of tire-related crashes, reduce <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> and save drivers on fuel costs, the Department of Transportation is taking the following actions:</P><UL><LI>

Work on this rule will supplement the work that DOT is completing, in collaboration with EPA and the White House, to implement historic fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks -- including an aggressive effort to meet the President's mandate of completing a second round of standards for medium and heavy duty trucks by 2016.  The tire fuel efficiency consumer information program targets consumers who are driving on the estimated 141 million tires sold annually that do not already have good rolling resistance. The program is focused on replacement tires because, although automobile manufacturers often equip new passenger cars and light trucks with low rolling resistance tires that are fuel efficient, consumers often replace a vehicle’s original tires with higher rolling resistance tires. A key component of the program will be to finalize a rule establishing a tire fuel efficiency consumer information program that will provide consumers with the information necessary to identify which tires are the most efficient. In fact, NHTSA estimates that if just 10 percent of aftermarket passenger car tires were upgraded to tires with a 10 percent improvement in rolling resistance, the annual savings would be more than $200 million from 72 million gallons of fuel and 690,000 metric tons of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, equivalent to the emissions from more than 1.6 billion miles of emission-free driving. </P><P><STRONG>Driving for Safety:</STRONG> For more than 10 years, NASCAR and NHTSA have worked together to promote positive traffic safety messages, including the importance of tire safety. This longstanding partnership is fueling the “Drive for Safety” campaign, which aims to promote messages that will keep drivers safe on the road.  NHTSA and NASCAR will announce new opportunities to expand their collaboration in the 2015 driving season. </P><P><STRONG>Kicking Off Tire Safety Month:</STRONG> Over the course of the next month, the Administration will initiate an enhanced effort to raise consumer awareness about the common-sense measures we can take to maintain our tires and save money, increase efficiency, and protect drivers across the country.  Building on the TireWise campaign, the following manufacturers, retailers, oil and gas companies have committed to partner with DOT to offer free inspections and tire inflation and to raise driver awareness through a number of activities:</P><UL style=""list-style-type: circle;""><LI><P><STRONG><U>Bridgestone Americas</U></STRONG> commits to supporting Tire Safety Month with free tire inspections at more than 2,200 Bridgestone Retail Operations stores under the brand names of Firestone Complete Auto Care, Tires Plus and Wheels Works; maintaining a website to inform consumers about tire safety and regular tire inspections; and promoting Teens Drive Smart, a hands-on program dedicated to equipping young drivers with knowledge and skills, including proper tire care.</P></LI><LI><P><STRONG><U>The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company</U></STRONG> commits to supporting Tire Safety Month with tire care education on its website; offering free inflation pressure services at its more than 600 company-owned retail stores and making tire care information available to new car buyers and when consumers purchase tires at Goodyear dealer and retail locations.</P></LI><LI><P><STRONG><U>Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Company</U></STRONG> commits to supporting Tire Safety Month with information prominently on their website, providing drivers with safety education and maintenance information with every tire purchased, providing a free tire safety kit to those who buy Cooper tires.  On social media, Cooper Tire will promote tire care messages targeted to younger drivers and to the blogging community that focuses on assuring that women --and particularly moms--have critical tire safety information.</P></LI><LI><P><STRONG><U>Michelin North America</U></STRONG> commits to supporting Tire Safety Month through &quot;Beyond the Driving Test,&quot; an initiative designed to increase the awareness among teen drivers of the importance of tire maintenance and safety in all the driver's education instruction programs across the nation.

Both NACS and its members will also conduct outreach to the media to further enhance the visibility of the initiative.  This effort will include working to identify flagship locations to help encourage other service stations to, over the coming months, find additional opportunities to educate consumers about the importance of tire maintenance, for example, through using pumptoppers, hosetags, or other visible media.</P></LI><LI><P><STRONG><U>ExxonMobil</U></STRONG> will increase the visibility of a :30 TV commercial, called “Tires.” in national network and cable rotation.  The spot communicates the fact that “if every driver in the US kept their tires properly inflated, the US would save up to 4 billion gallons of fuel.”  In addition to TV, the tire inflation message will be promoted via ExxonMobil social media channels, like Twitter and LinkedIn, to quickly and simply convey the tie between tire inflation and fuel efficiency.</P></LI><LI><P><STRONG><U>BP</U></STRONG>, in conjunction with Tire Safety Month, will work to promote safety, savings to consumers and increased energy efficiency.  Over the coming months, BP will expand messaging through its retailer website and through its periodic newsletter sent to a database of some 1.8 million consumer-members of the &quot;Driver Rewards&quot; program. </P></LI><LI><P><STRONG><U>Discount Tire</U></STRONG> is committing to improving tire safety awareness and fuel efficiency nationwide through several integrated campaigns with national industry partners. Discount Tire will integrate TireWise campaign materials into a public service announcement (PSA) kit including targeted press releases, blogs and other special messaging events; utilize its website to highlight partnership and distribute downloadable PSA kit documents; activate social media around the awareness campaign; utilize in-store locations by displaying awareness information and providing campaign packets including free air gauges and TireWise materials to customers.</P></LI><LI><P><STRONG><U>TireRack.com</U></STRONG> commits to supporting Tire Safety Month with information prominently on its website, and providing all drivers who visit with safety education and tire maintenance information.  On social media, Tire Rack will promote tire care messages targeted to drivers of all ages and to the blogging community.</P></LI></UL><P><U>Today’s actions build on substantial progress to improve fuel economy and increase driver safety, through the following actions:</U></P><P><STRONG>Launching TireWise:</STRONG> In May 2014, NHTSA launched its TireWise campaign, which provides consumers and retailers with essential information about choosing and caring for tires. The TireWise web site has pages for Tire Buying, Maintenance, Aging, Labeling, and Fuel Efficiency as well as a page for Tire Retailers. The Fuel Efficiency page highlights the benefits of proper tire inflation pressure and low rolling resistance tires.</P><P><STRONG>Accelerating the Use of Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems: </STRONG>All new light vehicles beginning with model year 2008 are required to be equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), which provides a warning to drivers when one or more of a vehicle’s tires become significantly underinflated (25% or more below the recommended inflation pressure).  Underinflation of tires increases the likelihood of many different types of crashes, including those involving skidding loss of control of the vehicle, and blowouts.  NHTSA estimates that TPMS saves about 120 lives each year.</P><P><STRONG>Supporting the Development of Efficient Tire Technology: </STRONG>The Department of Energy’s Vehicle Technologies Office (VTO) is currently supporting five tire research and development projects focused on improving the fuel economy of cars and trucks up to 4%.  These projects total $12M, including a government share of $6M, and support new tire designs with reduced rolling resistance, while maintaining or improving the safety and handling performance of current, state-of-the-art tire designs.  Projects include the development of improved tread materials, improved structural designs for lower weight, and tires that maintain proper inflation through decreased leakage or automatic inflation technology.</P><P><STRONG>Highlighting the Benefits of Efficient Tires: </STRONG>EPA's SmartWay Technology program has conducted and published research findings that demonstrate the significant fuel savings achieved by using low rolling resistance tires in heavy-duty trucks. EPA verifies the performance of commercially available low rolling resistance tires for tractor trailer applications as well as other fuel saving technologies. EPA has demonstrated that over three percent fuel savings can be achieved in long haul trucks with low rolling resistance tires compared to ‎other popular tires. These savings can even be as high as seven to ten percent when compared to higher rolling resistance tires. EPA also estimates trucks can achieve up to one percent fuel savings benefit by using automatic tire inflation systems. EPA includes information about these technologies as well as other fuel saving information at <A href=""http://www.epa.gov/smartway/about/outreach.htm"">www.epa.gov/smartway/about/outreach.htm</A></P><P><STRONG>Working on the Next Round of Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium and Heavy-Duty Vehicles:</STRONG> Earlier this year, the President directed the EPA and the DOT’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to develop and issue the next phase of medium- and heavy-duty vehicle fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards by March 2016. Under this timeline, the agencies are expected to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by March 2015. This second round of fuel efficiency standards will build on the first-ever standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (model years 2014 through 2018), which were proposed and finalized by these agencies and will save vehicle owners and operators an estimated $50 billion in fuel costs and save a projected 530 million barrels of oil. The agencies expect that new standards will encourage medium- and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers to employ lower rolling resistance tires in multiple segments of the next generation of commercial vehicles, from large pickups and vans all the way up to big-rig tractors and trailers.</P><P><STRONG>Leading by Example: </STRONG>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), which acquires and leases vehicles for Federal fleets, issued guidance in 2008 on tire pressure maintenance. In fact, due to continued efforts to implement measures such as rightsizing the fleet, utilizing alternative fuel vehicles, and ensuring proper tire pressure maintenance, <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> from the entire Federal fleet has decreased by 7.8 percent since 2008. The Department of Defense, with one of the largest Federal fleets requires users to maintain tires at the maximum pressure recommended by the vehicles’ manufacturers. For example, the Air Force requires vehicle operators to document tire pressure inspections each month at a minimum. The Navy requires vehicle operators to check tire pressure before using a vehicle and conduct preventive maintenance on vehicles, including tire pressure and tread checks, at least every 3 months, 5,000 miles, or 200 hours of use. Similarly, the Defense Logistics Agency requires vehicle operators to check vehicle equipment, including tire pressure, daily.</P><P><STRONG>Issuing Historic Standards for Passenger Vehicles: </STRONG>In President Obama’s first term, he called on the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation to take action to double fuel economy standards by 2025 and cut vehicle greenhouse gas emissions in half. These actions combat <mark>climate change</mark> and help American families save money – more than $8,000 in fuel costs for each car by 2025. In fact, over the duration of the program, Americans will save a total of $1.7 trillion in fuel costs and reduce oil consumption by more than 2 million barrels per day. And we are on track to roughly double fuel economy by 2025, proving once again that addressing <mark>climate change</mark> can go hand in hand with strong economic growth.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In this 1997 photo Sandia researchers, clockwise from bottom left, Roger Assink, Mike Malone, Gary Jones, and Ken Gillen, all now retired, discuss samples in a project that looked at how tires age. The Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between Sandia and Goodyear has been renewed repeatedly since 1993 and Goodyear continues to produce innovative products developed in collaboration with the Labs. “So many good things have come out of this enduring partnership,” says Mary Monson, senior manager of Technology Partnerships Dept. 1180. “It has worked both ways. We were able to apply our codes to a real-world problem, and improve our codes. And Goodyear was able to develop revolutionary products.”  (Photo by Randy Montoya)</P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>In a partnership almost as old as technology transfer itself, Sandia Labs and Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company have worked together for 25 years to create better vehicle tires, more advanced computational mechanics, and keep Goodyear competitive in a tough business environment. “You might wonder how national defense systems and nuclear stockpile management relate to tire science,” says Mary Monson, senior manager of Technology Partnerships Dept. 1180. “But a tire is a complex system, and that’s something Sandia knows well. The partnership allows Sandia to enhance our software toolkits and improve our capabilities for mission applications while simultaneously addressing Goodyear’s proprietary challenges.”</P><P>Sandia and Goodyear signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_research_and_development_agreement"">CRADA</A>, in 1993, back when technology transfer from the national labs was in its nascent heyday. In 1980, the <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenson-Wydler_Technology_<mark>Innovation</mark>_Act_of_1980"">Stevenson-Wydler Technology <mark>Innovation</mark> Act</A> was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter, becoming the first major US technology transfer legislation. It required federal laboratories to actively participate in and budget for technology transfer activities. Stevenson-Wydler was followed by the <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Technology_Transfer_Act_of_1986"">Federal Technology Act of 1986,</A> the second major piece of legislation focused on tech transfer from federal government agencies to the private sector. It established the Federal Laboratory Consortium and let federal labs enter into CRADAs with private industry.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;Tech transfer was an exciting new opportunity for the labs.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>“Tech transfer was an exciting new opportunity for the labs,” Mary says. “The Department of Energy really embraced the tech transfer concept for federal agencies in the late 1980s, early 1990s. Part of the defense programs budget was put aside for US economic security for the nation as well as enhancing the unique capabilities of the labs through solving complex real-world problems. Labs made proposals and were awarded funding to collaborate with partners.”</P><P><STRONG>Designing the ideal tire</STRONG></P><P>Goodyear took note. It was the only remaining US tire manufacturer and needed to cut its R&amp;D budget to stay competitive with companies like Bridgestone and Michelin. The company reached out to Sandia in the summer of 1992 and executives and scientists forged a relationship through back-and-forth visits to each other’s sites.</P><P>“They looked at our advanced computational mechanics software applications developed for nuclear weapons programs after the government halted underground testing and saw that they could be applied to tires. Instead of building and testing three to five prototypes before a tire was ready for manufacture, they could use our computer codes to develop one,” Mary says. “Time was dramatically reduced, by half or more.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""oneCol      clearfix     ""><FIGURE class=""            width50                  figLeft     ""><FIGCAPTION><P>COMPUTER MODEL – This simulation shows a finite-element model of a typical tire. As a result of its partnership with Sandia Labs, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company models its tire designs before molds are ordered.</P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Sandia’s tools went to work on the many components of a tire system.</P><P>“It’s often surprising to people to learn just how complicated it is to model and simulate tire performance, considering millions of material combinations and permutations and blending structural mechanics, rigid body, and fluid dynamics under varying temperature, pressure, and wear conditions,” says Dale Moseley, Goodyear’s global project manager.</P><P>The collaboration produced the Assurance TripleTred, a unique all-weather tire with a three-part tread pattern. Goodyear wanted a visually distinctive tire that would generate buzz and demonstrate its best technology and quality, in 12 months. The Assurance line was launched in 2004, and in 2005 Sandia and Goodyear won a joint R&amp;D 100 Award for the tires, particularly the TripleTred, which was brought from concept to market in less than a year. Goodyear says the tire could not have been produced without modeling and predictive testing tools developed with Sandia.</P><P>A wide range of lab technologies have played a role in the CRADA including advanced computational mechanics, computational simulation and verification, elastomeric materials, structural and tire dynamics, advanced manufacturing of rubber products, efficient characterization methods for structural dynamics, reliability tools for manufacturing processes, sensor systems, data science, human reliability, and engineered products.</P><P><STRONG>Competitive advantage in a complex business</STRONG></P><P>Today 100 percent of tire designs at Goodyear are modeled before molds are ordered. The company is in the top three of the <A href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/225677/revenue-of-the-leading-tire-producers-worldwide/"">world’s largest tire manufacturers </A>and credits its work with Sandia for reducing new product development times, producing better tires and manufacturing methods, boosting efficiency, and lowering R&amp;D costs, all contributing to a competitive advantage in a complex industry. “Our relationship with Sandia has been very beneficial in our competitive success in the global automotive industry, allowing us to begin submitting ‘virtual tires’ to automakers that can be incorporated into their vehicle models early in the development process as they tune the vehicle designs,” Moseley says.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;. . . the new capabilities they commission us to develop help us with simulations in our national security work.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The CRADA has been renewed repeatedly since 1993 and Goodyear continues to produce innovative products developed in collaboration with Sandia. “So many good things have come out of this enduring partnership,” Mary says. “It has worked both ways. We were able to apply our codes to a real-world problem, and improve our codes. And Goodyear was able to develop revolutionary products.”</P><P>Ted Blacker, manager of Simulation Modeling Sciences Dept. 1543, says the partnership has been successful because it is strategic. “We focus on strategic technical challenges where advanced technology from both sides can change the future,” he says. “Almost without fail, the new capabilities they commission us to develop, for example, to model rotating, twisting, and deforming tires, help us with simulations in our national security work.”</P><P>Much research done under the CRADA has been applied to Sandia’s science-based nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship mission. Finite-element analysis let Sandia look closely at re-entry vehicle vibration, and research on predicting materials lifetimes addressed design issues ranging from large-scale weapon component deformation to advanced earth penetrators.</P><P>The work with Goodyear led to a deeper appreciation at Sandia of the value of computer modeling in the early stages of development. “We showed that modeling and simulation made a difference in developing better products faster,” Ted says. “Our computational tools typically were used late in the process to understand why something broke and how to fix it. Now we use modeling more in the up-front stages, such as in the early design, to reduce testing.&quot;</P><P>Mary says CRADAs are an important technology transfer tool. “They help us sustain and improve our capabilities because we’re applying our technology to a company’s pressing problems,” she says. “There’s an urgency. It’s not abstract.”</P><P>She says the Goodyear CRADA has allowed Sandia researchers to work with peers in industry and share best practices. “It really is collaborative,” she says. “Both teams bring a different way of looking at a problem. We have learned a lot through those interactions about how to approach problems differently.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Bell </DIV></DIV><P>Located directly north of Watts, Florence-Firestone in unincorporated Los Angeles County is one of the most historic neighborhoods in Southern California. This week L.A. Letters spotlights the history of Florence-Firestone and a cadre of its local residents and stakeholders who are working tirelessly to improve the community that they love so much.
The history of the area starts in the late 19th Century when the Southern Pacific and Pacific Electric railroads had stops along Florence and Graham streets. The district was originally called Florence-Graham, and it has always had a high density of housing because of the adjacent manufacturing core. In later years, the County rebranded it Florence-Firestone in reference to Florence Avenue and Firestone Boulevard, the two major east-west thoroughfares that bisect the community.</P><P>Located six miles south of Downtown Los Angeles, the neighborhood is 3.5 square miles and is surrounded by Huntington Park, South Gate and Los Angeles. It is often lumped in with South Central Los Angeles, but it is unincorporated Los Angeles County and not officially part of the City of Los Angeles, though it is directly north of Watts, which is an official city district. The boundaries zig zag a bit, but generally speaking the northern border is Slauson, the eastern border is Alameda, the western border is Central Avenue, and the southern boundary is Century and the neighborhood of Watts. Within the district is an eclectic mix of commercial, residential and industrial zoning. This can especially be seen on streets like Compton Avenue, where storefront churches are next door to small houses, family-run retail stores, and archaic industrial buildings.</P><P>Jonathan P. Bell is a Los Angeles County Urban Planner that has been very active in the Florence-Firestone community over the last decade. He tells me, &quot;Up until now, there has been no published history of the Florence-Firestone area, but historians have written about everything else around it.&quot; Bell is correct with his assertion -- there has been plenty of history recorded about Watts, the Central Avenue Corridor, Huntington Park, and South Gate, all located nearby. Bell is deeply committed to improve Florence-Firestone and to share its untold story. He has worked closely with local residents and the county library in order to do this. The Boyle Heights-born, <A href=""http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/columns/la-letters/on-location-montebello.html"">Montebello</A>-raised Bell loves <A href=""http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/columns/la-letters/south-la-on-the-rise.html"">South Los Angeles</A> as a whole, and takes his job very seriously as urban planner. He knows the area better than just about anyone.</P><P>Another fascinating point about the district, Bell tells me, is its zip codes. &quot;California's zip codes run the ninety-thousands,&quot; he says. &quot;Florence-Firestone's zip codes are 90001 and 90002. Origination points. The statewide zip codes BEGIN in Florence-Firestone. We cannot deny that history! Yet somehow historians have overlooked the Florence-Firestone community.&quot;</P><P>The population of Florence-Firestone has always been diverse, dating back to over a century ago. First, it was European settlers in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, and then African Americans came in the early 20th Century, particularly because of the area's proximity to Central Avenue and Watts. Mexican immigrants soon joined the black population, and by the late 20th Century Latinos from Central and South America started arriving. Florence-Firestone has always served as an origination point for new arrivals to Southern California.</P><DIV class=""dnd-widget-wrapper context-kl_image_original_context type-image atom-align-center""><DIV class=""dnd-caption-wrapper"">Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 1957 | Kelly-Holiday Collection of Negatives and Photographs, Los Angeles Public Library</DIV></DIV><P>The massive Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company factory, formerly located on Central between Gage and Florence, was a key factor in the area's growing population during the early 20th Century. In its heyday over 2,500 employees worked there and operations ran 24 hours a day, seven days a week for many years. Goodyear even built a small residential tract for its employees early on. A portion of the area was dubbed the Wingfoot Industrial District, in honor of the Goodyear logo. The former Goodyear site is now operated by the United States Postal Service. It is a giant parcel of land that at one point in time even had enough space for a hangar for the earliest versions of the Goodyear Blimp.</P><P>Less than two miles southeast of the former Goodyear plant at Alameda and Firestone is the equally massive former plant for Firestone tires. Located in South Gate, this plant was located adjacent to Alameda during the days when the street was like a Berlin Wall in relationship to the restrictive housing covenants in place in Southern California from the early 20th Century. East of Alameda, into areas like South Gate and Huntington Park, were white neighborhoods considered off limits to people of color for much of the 20th Century until these covenants were declared unconstitutional in 1948.</P><P>Firestone Boulevard's name changes to Manchester a mile west of the former Firestone plant at Central Avenue when it enters the city of Los Angeles. These two large industrial hubs were not the only industrial sites in the area; there were dozens of other assembly plants and factories within a few mile radius. To this day, there are numerous auto dismantling shops and other small industrial sites on Alameda heading south into Watts.
The housing stock in Florence-Firestone has always been dense, and includes lots of bungalows, duplexes, triplexes, and occasional ranch houses and Victorians to accommodate the working man. Though many of the first residents were working-class whites, often from the South, there were many European immigrants and by the time of the Second World War, large numbers of African-Americans called the area home.</P><P>The story of the neighborhood's eventual decline is by now a familiar story that applies to not only South Los Angeles, but also to nearby cities like South Gate, Huntington Park, and other parts of the former manufacturing core, like Lynwood and Compton. The slow decline began with the closing of many of the local factories during the 1960s and '70s, and the slow disinvestment of the area following both the 1965 Watts Uprisings and the 1992 Rodney King Uprisings.</P><DIV class=""dnd-widget-wrapper context-kl_image_original_context type-image atom-align-center""><DIV class=""dnd-caption-wrapper"">38-ply heavy duty tire in front of the Firestone plant, 1964 | Photo: Herald-Examiner Collection, Los Angeles Public Library</DIV></DIV><P>What's less known though, is that crime has gone down dramatically in Florence-Firestone over the last decade. The neighborhood has been making a quiet resurgence in recent years. The improvements can be directly attributed to a few groups of local residents, stakeholders, and county officials that have been working together.
For this reason the County of Los Angeles Public Library, in partnership with the Florence-Firestone Community Leaders organization and the Florence-Firestone/Walnut Park Chamber of Commerce, have banded together to create a community history website, called &quot;<A href=""http://www.colapublib.org/ffeverydayheroes/"">Florence-Firestone: Stories of Everyday Heroes</A>,&quot; that gathers videos, photos and narratives of these &quot;everyday heroes,&quot; from Florence-Firestone. This site was the brainchild of Angel Nicolas, a longtime Los Angeles County Public librarian that slowly came to know the Florence-Firestone community and was very impressed with the activists he met. Nicolas has been working very hard over the last year collecting their stories.</P><P>On June 24 at the Florence-Firestone Service Center, a launch event was held for the website, and several of the community leaders were on hand to share their testimonies. The event was a spirited occasion with a palpable excitement in the air. The Service Center, located on Compton Avenue directly across the street from the historic first Sheriff's Station, was the perfect site to hold this gathering. In its lobby is a large mural, painted in 2010 by the late great South Los Angeles artist <A href=""http://www.publicartarchive.org/work/short-stories"">Willie Middlebrook</A>, called &quot;Short Stories,&quot; depicting the ethnic diversity of the past and present of Florence-Firestone. Middlebrook died in 2012 and this piece was one of his final works. He was well known for loving Los Angeles and doing his best to capture untold stories. He would have been very happy to hear about the &quot;Everyday Heroes&quot; project.</P><P>The newly launched site now features video interviews with eight individuals deeply engaged in improving the Florence-Firestone community. Their commitment to improve their neighborhood was truly inspiring. I attended the launch event, and spoke with a number of these leaders. Here are a few of their stories:</P><P><A href=""http://www.colapublib.org/ffeverydayheroes/?p=27"">William Allen</A> is a Vietnam veteran that grew up in Florence-Firestone during the 1950s, and ended up moving back to the neighborhood 40 years later after retiring from the military. When he moved back into the property his parents had owned, he was disappointed by how decrepit their old home, and the whole area, had become. His parents had rented out their property for many years, and in the course of his travels he had lost touch with his early stomping grounds.</P><P>In his video interview he spoke about how his best friend while growing up was a Mexican-American and that during his day, black and brown residents got along very well. When he returned to the neighborhood, there was more tension than he remembered. Shortly after he moved back into the house his parents had bought in 1954, there was a drive-by shooting next door, and then his home was robbed.</P><DIV class=""dnd-widget-wrapper context-kl_image_original_context type-image atom-align-center""><DIV class=""dnd-caption-wrapper"">William Allen on his 5th birthday | Photo: <A data-cke-saved-href=""http://www.colapublib.org/ffeverydayheroes/?p=27"" href=""http://www.colapublib.org/ffeverydayheroes/?p=27"">Florence-Firestone Everyday Heroes</A></DIV></DIV><P>These events led him to visit the local Sheriff's station at Compton Avenue and Nadeau Street, and he was told about the Florence-Firestone Community Leaders organization. He's been a key member of the group from this day on. He now mentors young basketball players, and he remains a leader in the community. At the launch event for &quot;Everyday Heroes,&quot; Allen briefly spoke before the crowd about his participation in the group and his deep love for Florence-Firestone.</P><P>Another local leader featured on the website and present at the launch is <A href=""http://www.colapublib.org/ffeverydayheroes/?p=25"">Paula Trejo</A>. Trejo is the President of the Florence-Firestone Community Leaders, and like William Allen she also grew up in the neighborhood and then moved out, only to move back again years later. When she returned in 2004, she was inspired to join up with other local activists like William Allen. She has raised children in the area and is very committed to getting local citizens more services in their community.</P><P><A href=""http://www.colapublib.org/ffeverydayheroes/?p=23"">Rick Aldridge</A> is also featured on the website and is very active with the Florence-Firestone Community Leaders. He grew up in a politically active family in the area, attending Fremont High School and then went on to both UCLA and Cal State L.A. for his graduate studies. He has been involved in economic development for many years and ended up moving back to the area when his parents were getting older. Similar to Allen and Trejo, he had been away from the area for many years and when he returned, he decided to contribute to making it better. He now brings his many years of experience in the business world to help the local economy, as well as improve the schools, in Florence-Firestone.</P><P>The Florence-Firestone Community Leaders is a diverse group of residents from the area that includes homeowners, business leaders, and working class residents. They meet every second Wednesday of the month at Washington Park at 6:30 p.m. Above all, they are about community empowerment. Aldridge notes in his interview that they all get along very well and he hopes to transfer this camaraderie across the district. The area was once predominantly black, then by the early '90s, it was equally black and Latino; now it is over 85% percent Latino and about 15% black.</P><P>Oral history from <A href=""http://www.colapublib.org/ffeverydayheroes/?p=21"">Jonathan P. Bell</A> is also featured on &quot;Everyday Heroes,&quot; and he works closely with the County Library, the Florence-Firestone Community Leaders, and the Chamber of Commerce. Bell tells me, &quot;Florence-Firestone is one of the best examples of a local community where different groups work together and peacefully coexist.&quot; Bell brings his knowledge of zoning codes and local history to the table and anything else they may need. Above all, he loves Florence-Firestone and wants to see the district flourish.</P><DIV class=""dnd-widget-wrapper context-kl_image_original_context type-image atom-align-center""><DIV class=""dnd-caption-wrapper"">| Photo: <A data-cke-saved-href=""http://www.colapublib.org/ffeverydayheroes/?p=25"" href=""http://www.colapublib.org/ffeverydayheroes/?p=25"">Florence-Firestone: Everyday Heroe</A>s</DIV></DIV><P>Another local stakeholder featured on the website and present at the launch event is <A href=""http://www.colapublib.org/ffeverydayheroes/?p=336"">Gloria Medina</A>, the president of the Florence-Firestone Merchants Association. Medina is a strong advocate for women entrepreneurs and has done a lot to stimulate local business. She was awarded two certificates from the County at the event for her service to the community.</P><P>One local resident who was at the event is 87-year-old Joseph Jacob Titus, who is yet to be filmed for the website, but will be in the future. Titus is a Caucasian man that has lived his entire life in Florence-Firestone. His father was a contractor that built apartment houses on 59th, 62nd, 63rd, and 64th Street during the 1920s. Titus told me that though his father had been quite wealthy during the '20s, he died $30,000 in debt in 1933. Titus went to Edison Junior High and Fremont High School. He remains a walking encyclopedia of local history and he told me several anecdotes about his long life in Florence-Firestone.</P><P>Titus said that there were so many fires at Goodyear Tire Company in his youth that Goodyear had its own Fire Department. He also spoke about the high level of toxic chemicals that were in the area because of all the factories. He reminisced about the Pacific Electric Streetcar and told me, &quot;The deaths we have had on the Blue Line are in the same places they were back in the days of the Red Car. History repeats itself.&quot; Titus also told me about the long-gone Gentry Theater that was at 66th and Compton Avenue, and about how one of the first Carl's Junior that ever opened was on Florence and Central. Titus has seen the neighborhood through all of its ups and downs. He told me that for a time over two decades ago there were &quot;20 dope dealers 24 hours a day,&quot; standing outside on his street. He said that sometimes he would find drugs that dealers would hide in his mailbox. Following a drive-by shooting next to his house in 1993, the sheriffs slowly began to clean up his street. They made it a one-way road and now he tells me it is much safer.</P><DIV class=""kl-ad kl-article-ad""><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-klw-custom kl-no-border kl-no-padtop kl-custom-story-continue""><P><SMALL>Story continues below</SMALL></P></DIV><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-klw-share kl-share kl-article-share""><DIV class=""kl-share-more-container""><A class=""kl-share-icon kl-share-icon-pinterest"" href=""https://pinterest.com/pin/create/link/?url=https://www.kcet.org/history-society/everyday-heroes-of-florence-firestone&amp;image=&amp;description="" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Pin on Pinterest</A><A class=""kl-share-icon kl-share-icon-linkedin"" href=""https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://www.kcet.org/history-society/everyday-heroes-of-florence-firestone&amp;title=&amp;summary=A%20summary%20of%20a%20story&amp;source="" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Share on LinkedIn</A><A class=""kl-share-icon kl-share-icon-googleplus"" href=""https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.kcet.org/history-society/everyday-heroes-of-florence-firestone"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Share on Google+</A></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Titus told me that he did not become involved in local community issues until the late 1980s, and it was the desperate nature of the times that pulled him in. He has collaborated with the Florence-Firestone Community Leaders and is well-known by the stakeholders as the District's elder statesman. In recent years, his sister Mary Rose Cortese has also moved back to the area and works closely with him around the community. On the night of the site launch, he was warmly greeted by other longtime residents like William Allen.</P><P>One more engaged local advocate I met was John Jones III, a field deputy from the 15th District that works for councilmember Joe Buscaino. Jones grew up in Florence-Firestone and now works in Watts for the City of Los Angeles. He told me he started as an activist in his teen years when he was involved with the preservation of Roosevelt Park. In 2008, Jones founded the <A href=""http://www.esrbc.org/"">Eastside Riders</A> (ESR), a local bicycle club based in Watts and South Los Angeles. According to their website,&quot;The purpose of the ESR is to prevent youth from joining gangs and/or taking drugs, but also engage youth who have a desire to enrich the community through recreational activities, specifically focusing on bicycle riding.&quot; The night I met Jones, he was also talking with Jonathan P. Bell about a series of proposed bike lanes that will connect from Florence-Firestone into Watts.</P><DIV class=""dnd-widget-wrapper context-kl_image_original_context type-image atom-align-center""><DIV class=""dnd-caption-wrapper"">Photo courtesy of Jonathan P. Bell</DIV></DIV><P>A few nights after the launch, I took a drive around Florence-Firestone with Jonathan P. Bell. He drove me down Slauson and showed me the old concrete platforms that remained on the street from when the Pacific Electric Streetcar was there. He drove me past a new pocket park on Gage, adjacent to the Blue Line Station. He also showed me where the first Sheriff's Station once was at Firestone Park near Nadeau and Compton Avenue. The building remains there but it is now the Sheriffs Youth Activity League, a place dedicated to helping local youth.</P><P>Bell drove me past the County Library on Florence near Miramonte, and told me that he wrote a thesis proposal on the <A href=""http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&amp;context=jonathanpbell"">history of the Florence and Graham branch libraries</A> a few years ago. They are two of the oldest libraries in the County system, but have had very little history recorded about either one. Bell is also not a fan of the idea some have of calling South Los Angeles &quot;SOLA.&quot; Similar to <A href=""http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/columns/la-letters/the-blk-grrrl-book-fair-in-historic-south-central.html"">Teka-Lark Fleming</A> and Skira Martinez, to him the area will always be South Central Los Angeles, and any new name erases the area's early history. Furthermore, he notes, &quot;Sola in Spanish means lonely girl,&quot; and for Bell, the vibrant streets of Florence-Firestone are anything but lonely. He loves the bustling shops on Florence Avenue and the district's colorful murals. He also showed me a few beautiful old craftsman homes nestled within the fabric of the neighborhood.</P><P>The Office of Supervisor Mark Ridley Thomas in the Second District has recently commissioned Cal Arts Provost Jeannene Przyblyski to do a history project on Florence-Firestone. Last year, they also commissioned writer and artist <A href=""http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/columns/la-letters/thematic-cartography-and-mapping-los-angeles.html  "">Rosten Woo</A> to do a highly acclaimed project on the nearby area of Willowbrook that came out on <A href=""http://www.halfletterpress.com/willowbrook-is-es/"">Half Letter Press</A>, who will also be publishing the project on Florence-Firestone.</P><P>Bell is excited to be taking over as the new incoming volunteer project manager for the Florence-Firestone &quot;Everyday Heroes,&quot; project because the former project manager Angel Nicolas has now become the Community Library Manager in Lynwood. There are many more residents and community leaders narratives that Bell intends to film and record. Bell is the perfect man for this job because he's been working in the area for over a decade now and he's well acquainted with local residents and business owners.
Bell and other community leaders like William Allen, Paula Trejo, Rick Aldridge, Gloria Medina, Erica Ortega, Celica Quinones, and Arthur Jones are firmly committed to improving the conditions of Florence-Firestone. The area has come a long way over the last century and has dramatically improved in the last decade because of their efforts. Salute to these everyday heroes and to Florence-Firestone for being a historic and vibrant district in the landscape of L.A. Letters.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

All of the sidewall markings related to tire service (load capacity, corresponding inflation pressure, etc.) are correct. Even though the tires were labeled incorrectly as “TREAD 4 PLIES STEEL CORD” on one side of the tires, the tires were manufactured with “TREAD 5 PLIES STEEL CORD”, which is correctly marked on the opposite tire sidewall. The mislabeling of these tires is not a safety concern and also has no impact on the retreading and recycling industries. The affected tire mold has already been corrected and all future production will have the correct number of plies shown on both sidewalls.</P><P id=""p-16"" data-page=""18210"">Goodyear noted that NHTSA has previously granted petitions for the same noncompliance related to tire construction information on tires because of surveys that show most consumers do not base purchases on tire construction information found on the tire sidewall.</P><P id=""p-17"" data-page=""18210"">Goodyear concluded by expressing the belief that the subject noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and that its petition to be exempted from providing notification of the noncompliance, as required by <A class=""usc external"" href=""https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=49&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=30118&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html"" target=""_blank"">49 U.S.C. 30118</A>, and a remedy for the noncompliance, as required by <A class=""usc external"" href=""https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=49&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=30120&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html"" target=""_blank"">49 U.S.C. 30120</A>, should be granted.</P><P id=""p-18"" data-page=""18210"">NHTSA's Decision:</P><P id=""p-19"" data-page=""18210""><EM>NHTSA's Analysis:</EM> The agency agrees with Goodyear that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. The agency believes that one measure of inconsequentiality to motor vehicle safety is that there is no effect of the noncompliance on the operational safety of vehicles on which these tires are mounted. Another measure of inconsequentiality which is relevant to this petition is the safety of people working in the tire retread, repair and recycling industries.</P><P id=""p-20"" data-page=""18210"">Although tire construction affects the strength and durability of tires, neither the agency nor the tire industry provides information relating tire strength and durability to the number of plies and types of ply cord material in the tread sidewall. Therefore, tire dealers and customers should consider the tire construction information along with other information such as the load capacity, maximum inflation pressure, and tread wear, temperature, and traction ratings, to assess performance capabilities of various tires. In the agency's judgement, the incorrect labeling of the tire construction information will have an inconsequential effect on motor vehicle safety because most consumers do not base tire purchases or vehicle operation parameters on the number of plies in a tire.</P><P id=""p-21"" data-page=""18210"">The agency also believes the noncompliance will have no measureable effect on the safety of the tire retread, repair, and recycling industries. The use of steel cord construction in the sidewall and tread is the primary safety concern of these industries.

Accordingly, Goodyear's petition is hereby granted and Goodyear is consequently exempted from the obligation of providing notification of, and a free remedy for, that noncompliance under <A class=""usc external"" href=""https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=49&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=30118&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html"" target=""_blank"">49 U.S.C. 30118</A> and 30120.</P><P id=""p-23"" data-page=""18211"">NHTSA notes that the statutory provisions (<A class=""usc external"" href=""https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=49&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=30118&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html"" target=""_blank"">49 U.S.C. 30118</A>(d) and 30120(h)) that permit manufacturers to file petitions for a determination of inconsequentiality allow NHTSA to exempt manufacturers only from the duties found in sections 30118 and 30120, respectively, to notify owners, purchasers, and dealers of a defect or noncompliance and to remedy the defect or noncompliance. Therefore, this decision only applies to the subject tires that Goodyear no longer controlled at the time it determined that the noncompliance existed. However, the granting of this petition does not relieve equipment distributors and dealers from the prohibitions on the sale, offer for sale, or introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of the noncompliant tires under their control after Goodyear notified them that the subject noncompliance exists.</P><SPAN class=""authority-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper""><SPAN class=""authority unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup"" data-tooltip-template=""#regtext-auth-tooltip-template"" data-tooltip-doc-override=""tooltip-enhanced"" data-text=""Start Authority""><SPAN class=""text"">Start Authority</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><P class=""authority"" id=""p-24"" data-page=""18211""><SPAN class=""auth-header"">Authority:</SPAN><SPAN class=""auth-content"">(<A class=""usc external"" href=""https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=49&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=30118&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html"" target=""_blank"">49 U.S.C. 30118</A>, 30120: delegations of authority at <A class=""cfr external"" href=""/select-citation/2017/04/17/49-CFR-1.95"">49 CFR 1.95</A> and 501.8)</SPAN></P><SPAN class=""authority-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper""><SPAN class=""authority unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup"" data-tooltip-template=""#regtext-auth-tooltip-template"" data-tooltip-doc-override=""tooltip-enhanced"" data-text=""End Authority""><SPAN class=""text"">End Authority</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""signature-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper""><SPAN class=""signature unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup"" data-tooltip-template=""#signature-tooltip-template"" data-tooltip-doc-override=""tooltip-enhanced"" data-text=""Start Signature""><SPAN class=""text"">Start Signature</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><DIV class=""signature""><P class=""signature-title"">Director, Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance.</P></DIV><SPAN class=""signature-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper""><SPAN class=""signature unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup"" data-tooltip-template=""#signature-tooltip-template"" data-tooltip-doc-override=""tooltip-enhanced"" data-text=""End Signature""><SPAN class=""text"">End Signature</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""supplemental-info-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper""><SPAN class=""supplemental-info unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup"" data-tooltip-template=""#suplinf-tooltip-template"" data-tooltip-doc-override=""tooltip-enhanced"" data-text=""End Supplemental Information""><SPAN class=""text"">End Supplemental Information</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><DIV class=""end-matter""><P class=""frdoc"">[FR Doc. <A href=""/a/2017-07615"">2017-07615</A> Filed 4-14-17; 8:45 am]</P><P class=""billing-code"">BILLING CODE 4910-59-P</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As daylight faded, Matthew Smith and Kerrybeth Hall were in rural West Texas headed to college when the left rear tire of Smith’s black Ford pickup failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truck skidded sideways on the busy highway, smashing through a wire fence before rolling over in the parched plains, killing them both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4177801-Hall-2nd-Amended-2.html&quot;&gt;Police listed&lt;/a&gt; the Goodyear Wrangler SilentArmor tire – among more than 40,000 the company&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4174325-Goodyear-recall.html&quot;&gt; later recalled&lt;/a&gt; – as a cause of the crash that August day in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fatal accident is a stark example of the deadly consequences of Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.’s lax approach to safety, contributing to deaths of motorists on the road and workers in its plants, a six-month investigation by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting has found. Tires involved in the accidents were manufactured in Goodyear plants in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and Danville, Virginia, where intense production demands and leaks in the roof during storms have endangered both workers and consumers for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reveal interviewed dozens of current and former Goodyear workers and analyzed hundreds of federal and state agency documents and court records from seven states. In interviews, several former employees said they felt pressure to put production before workplace safety. Others recalled a quota-driven motto invoked on the shop floor: “Round and black and out the back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pressure to get the job done was very intense,” said Joel Burdette, who worked as an area manager at the company’s Union City, Tennessee, plant before&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stategazette.com/story/1743289.html&quot;&gt; it closed&lt;/a&gt; in 2011. Burdette then took a similar job at the Danville plant, leaving in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was a motto: Anything goes as long as it goes onto the truck and gets shipped out,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About seven months after Smith and Hall were killed, Goodyear sent out recall notices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Use of these tires in severe conditions could result in partial tread separation which could lead to vehicle damage or a motor vehicle crash,” the company stated in a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4174325-Goodyear-recall.html#annotation/a386347&quot;&gt; letter&lt;/a&gt; to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodyear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4174325-Goodyear-recall.html#annotation/a386346&quot;&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; it had been monitoring problems with the SilentArmor tires since at least May 2010, 15 months before the deaths of Smith and Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tire in Smith and Hall’s crash was made in Fayetteville, but at least two others died in accidents over the last five years after tires made at Goodyear’s Danville plant failed. Another motorist, Harry Patel of Michigan,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4165594-2013-11-13-Plfs-Complaint-amp-Jury-Demand.html&quot;&gt; became a partial quadriplegic&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 when a tire on his Nissan Pathfinder&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4165595-Traffic-Crash-Report-070612.html&quot;&gt; separated&lt;/a&gt;, causing the SUV to flip and land in a ditch. That tire was made at Goodyear’s Fayetteville plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hearing arguments from Patel’s lawyers that Goodyear had ramped up production, compromising the quality of its tires, a jury &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heraldpalladium.com/news/local/jury-awards-million-to-patel/article_63fa7083-188d-583e-86dd-4e42fb461637.html&quot;&gt;awarded him $16 million&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest product liability awards in Michigan’s history. The 2015 award, which Goodyear has appealed, was cut nearly in half because of state liability caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The shocking collapse of safety controls at Goodyear’s plants has inflicted immeasurable losses on the many families of Goodyear customers killed in avoidable tragedies,” said John Gsanger, an attorney for the families of Patel and Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
A deadly record
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing tires is a hazardous process requiring a vigilant approach to safety. In plants that can stretch over 50 football fields, workers use massive machines to fashion rubber and steel into tens of thousands of tires for everyday motorists and clients ranging from NASCAR to FedEx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plants can be grimy. Machines that grind rubber spew fine dust over workers’ clothes and faces. Even after showering, they ooze black residue from their pores, leaving imprints of their bodies on their bedsheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like working in a coal mine,” said Bo Rosas, a former maintenance manager at Goodyear’s Danville plant. “When you blow your nose, you see black film.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even among its peers, Goodyear stands out. The tire giant is among the deadliest manufacturers in the nation for workers, Reveal’s analysis of data from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration shows. Since August 2015, five Goodyear workers have been killed – four at the Virginia plant in one year alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellis Jones, Goodyear’s senior director of global environmental health, safety and sustainability, called the company’s workplace deaths “an unusual situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We reacted after every incident,” he said, referring to the company’s rash of workplace accidents. “We did have to take a step back and say, ‘Let’s look at the system within Danville and identify the gaps in the system, and let’s close those gaps.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While acknowledging those safety lapses, Jones said the company’s tires are safe for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Each stage of the process, that raw material, that component is tested, and that finished tire is tested for quality,” he said. “So we’re very confident about the quality of our product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After serious workplace accidents, the company’s managers have both clashed with investigators and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4198439-Safety-narrative-Charles-Skaggs.html&quot;&gt; admitted&lt;/a&gt; to regulators that they ignored workplace safety lapses, Reveal found. In one instance, a manager admitted to an accumulation of oil over a period of days due to a reduction in personnel in the cleaning crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since October 2008, Goodyear has been fined more than $1.9 million for nearly 200 health and workplace safety violations, far more than its four major competitors combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But its deadly track record has received scant national attention, and the publicly traded company has continued to profit from clients ranging from Boeing to the U.S. military and took&lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.goodyear.com/en-US/media/news/goodyear_reports_fou.html&quot;&gt; in $1.3 billion&lt;/a&gt; in net income last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/how-an-industry-group-is-driving-trumps-workplace-safety-agenda/&quot;&gt;Shifting politics&lt;/a&gt; in Washington stand to further insulate companies such as Goodyear from accountability. Reinvigorating manufacturing and job growth is at the core of President Donald Trump’s&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/bringing-back-jobs-and-growth&quot;&gt; economic agenda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet protections for factory workers, who overwhelmingly&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/10/donald-trump-got-reagan-like-support-from-union-households/?utm_term=.d73146f9074e&quot;&gt; supported Trump&lt;/a&gt;, are being dismantled. The administration is rolling back and postponing Obama-era protections in keeping with goals laid out by the National Association of Manufacturers, a prominent Washington industry group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.goodyear.com/en-US/about/leadership.html&quot;&gt;Richard Kramer&lt;/a&gt;, Goodyear’s chairman, chief executive officer and president, serves on the association’s board. A Goodyear spokeswoman said Kramer was unavailable for an interview but made Jones available instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. – a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions – said lobbyists for dangerous companies should not be permitted to dismantle workplace protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Trump and Republicans in Congress have taken one whack after another at regulations that make sure workers are safe on the job,” Warren said in a statement to Reveal. “Washington is supposed to work for hardworking Americans, not for the trade associations for the companies that make their profit by taking shortcuts on worker safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
In the pit
&lt;p&gt;Just before midnight on April 11, 2016, Charles “Greg” Cooper, a maintenance mechanic on the graveyard shift, descended alone into a machine pit in the dimly lit basement of the tire plant in Danville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He set to work replacing a broken rope that wicked oil from wastewater swirling in a huge vat. Rubber, hooks and wires lay strewn around him on the floor near the pit, where steam rose from the boiling water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal rules require a safety guard or cover on any openings in the floor. But about six months earlier, an electric pump had broken, and “there was still a huge hole left directly over the pit,”&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4310148-Danville-Report-on-Hole.html#document/p1/a389402&quot;&gt; records show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several hours passed before a manager noticed that Cooper was gone and dispatched his co-workers to search the plant. Finally, one of their flashlights sliced through the darkness, its beam illuminating his body, floating face down in the pit. Then came the official call: “Man down!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was far too late. Cooper had been boiled alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooper was the third of four workers to die at the company’s Danville plant over one year ending in August 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Virginia workplace safety investigator who arrived to scour the area where the 52-year-old died noted it was slippery. The floor around the gaping hole atop the pit was “covered with oil, grease, water and rubber due to lack of housekeeping and it simulated a condition like working on ice,” the investigator &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4328116-OSHA-report.html#document/p2/a393302&quot;&gt;wrote.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hole had been in plain view of a maintenance manager who was required to inspect the area on each shift, records show. Investigators found two other holes nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the accident, Greg Kerr, the plant’s manufacturing director,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heraldcourier.com/news/third-death-closes-danville-s-goodyear-until-friday-osha-investigating/article_17e51b72-0114-11e6-85cb-bbfe9cf03ee9.html&quot;&gt; told&lt;/a&gt; a local newspaper that Goodyear would “work with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the local authorities to fully investigate the incident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Goodyear’s conduct after the investigation proved quite the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Employer difficult to deal with,” an investigator from the Virginia Occupational Safety and Health Program&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4201872-20171113155451339.html&quot;&gt; noted&lt;/a&gt;. “Slow to respond to any request, encouraging employees to not cooperate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Goodyear workers told local police, on condition of anonymity, that Cooper never should have been working alone that night. They said the plant’s policy had required maintenance employees in the area to work in pairs since 2007, when a worker in the same part of the plant was&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/establishment.inspection_detail?id=311026355&quot;&gt; severely burned&lt;/a&gt; and later died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At no time were maintenance workers to work in that area alone, as it is one of the most dangerous areas of the plant,” police investigators&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4197950-Danville-Police-report-Cooper.html#document/p1/a387762&quot;&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, Cooper was assigned to make the repair by himself,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4198092-Danville-Police-report-Cooper-alone.html&quot;&gt; police records show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In near darkness, giant machines resembling egg beaters thrash bales of rubber into flat sheets, drowning out workers’ voices. So even if Cooper had screamed for help, “there’s no way you could get in touch,” Wayne Barber, his longtime work partner and close friend, told Reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What gets me is him being in the pit for so long and nobody going to look for him,” he said. “The supervisor should have found out where he was after that long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barber wrestles with how things might have been different if he had been at Cooper’s side that night instead of at home mourning the recent death of his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He wouldn’t have stayed in that hole for four or five hours,” Barber said as he sat on his front stoop, adding quietly, “It could have been me. We might have both ended up in the hole.”&lt;/p&gt;
Chronic workplace safety hazards 
&lt;p&gt;While investigating an earlier incident at another Goodyear plant, federal workplace safety investigators found unguarded floor holes had long been a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2015, about a year before Cooper was killed, a worker at the Topeka, Kansas, plant suffered third-degree burns on the left side of his body as he worked on a tire-curing press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators wrote that the plant’s then–safety manager, Tim Washeck,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4201206-GYTR1030711-Redacted.html&quot;&gt; told them&lt;/a&gt; that floor holes had been “observed for as long as they can recall and … covering them had not been considered in the past.” OSHA cited the plant for the violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following month, a worker at the company’s plant in Gadsden, Alabama, fell from a platform, which lacked standard railings, onto a conveyor belt, breaking his left arm, shoulder, four ribs and collarbone. Oil leaking from a nearby milling machine covered the floor where he had been working. The plant’s safety manager, Charles Skaggs, was aware of the oil leak and open-sided platform,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4198439-Safety-narrative-Charles-Skaggs.html&quot;&gt; investigators noted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washeck and Skaggs did not return calls seeking comment. Jones, Goodyear’s senior safety director, declined to comment on specific cases but noted that Goodyear safety officials are expected to ensure that “every associate goes home safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In settlements with the Virginia Occupational Safety and Health Program after lapses that included the four Danville deaths, Goodyear admitted it had violated workplace safety and health laws more than 100 times. The company agreed to a reduced&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doli.virginia.gov/media_room/press%20releases%202017/pdfs%20for%20posting%20to%20web%20site/DOLI%20News%20Release%20on%20Goodyear%20Settlement%2002.10.2017.pdf&quot;&gt; fine of $1.75 million&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in a move that three former top federal safety officials called “highly unusual” and “outrageous,” Virginia regulators at the time invited the company to apply for the state’s so-called&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doli.virginia.gov/vosh_coop/vosh_vpp.html&quot;&gt; Voluntary Protection Program&lt;/a&gt;, which shields companies with exemplary safety programs and below-average injury rates from routine safety inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia is one of 28 states and U.S. territories that run their own workplace health and safety programs, covering private- or public-sector workers or both. Most of these states have adopted standards that are identical to those set by OSHA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the Goodyear settlement, a&lt;a href=&quot;http://ksnt.com/2017/03/14/family-remembers-man-after-goodyear-plant-death/&quot;&gt; 61-year-old&lt;/a&gt; contract worker was killed at the company’s Topeka, Kansas, plant when a falling object struck him in the head. He left behind a wife and daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSHA imposed&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4081721-Goodyear1217010-Citation.html&quot;&gt; a fine&lt;/a&gt; of $27,713 against Goodyear for the accident, which the company quickly contested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A firm in which five workers are killed over 18 months is clearly a firm in which the management is not adequately focused on worker safety,” said David Michaels, who led OSHA under President Barack Obama and now is a professor at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is also a sign of the absence of operational excellence, since worker fatalities and serious injuries do not occur when the production process is tightly controlled.”&lt;/p&gt;
‘Round and black and out the back’

&lt;p&gt;Gerri Hall remembers the day his daughter, Kerrybeth, came home from school and told him she’d decided to become a paramedic. She was 14. The petite blonde with a piercing laugh learned that her father, a firefighter and EMT, had rescued her friend after a car accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She thought that’s what she was here for, is to help people,” Hall said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks before she was due to start a paramedic program at Victoria College in Texas, police found the 18-year-old’s mangled body still strapped into the passenger seat after the Goodyear tire failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Disbelief,” said Hall, 51, who lives in Placedo, near the Texas Gulf Coast, a little more than an hour’s drive northeast of Corpus Christi. “I always wake up thinking I’ll see her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kerrybeth was our rock, and we all leaned on her,” Hall added. “It has torn the foundation of our family apart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Kerrybeth’s death, Gerri Hall says he has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. He quit his job as an EMT and firefighter, unable to face any more car accidents without picturing his daughter. In a safe at home, he keeps an old cellphone with a text his daughter sent him just before the wreck. “Love you too daddy,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tire industry expert hired by John Gsanger, the Hall family’s lawyer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4174333-Carlson-Report.html#document/p14/a392006&quot;&gt;blamed &lt;/a&gt;design and manufacturing flaws for weakening the Goodyear tire before it failed, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4174333-Carlson-Report.html&quot;&gt;court records.&lt;/a&gt; Goodyear’s lawyers insisted the tires were safe and said the truck must have hit an object that caused the tire to separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dozen former workers at the company’s Fayetteville and Danville plants gave sworn statements criticizing the plant’s practices, according to court filings. In interviews with Reveal, more than seven other former Goodyear workers blamed intense production demands and leaks in the plants’ roof during rainstorms for weakening some tires, potentially causing them to fail. In court records, some former workers have said managers expected them to meet production quotas, but it is unclear whether quotas still exist at Goodyear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4165712-David-Hyde.html#document/p25/a386061&quot;&gt; sworn statement&lt;/a&gt;, David Hyde, who worked as a tire builder at the Danville plant from 1977 to 2009, said the “round and black and out the back” motto was emblematic of the company’s operational failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Goodyear talks the talk, but they don’t walk the (walk),” Hyde said. “They, you know, they say they want to build a quality product. … You just don’t understand the stuff I’ve seen out there. It’s not good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones, Goodyear’s senior safety director, acknowledged that some workers use that motto but said workers concerned about unsafe conditions are encouraged to speak up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve worked in Danville, worked in many factories, so you hear that, but again, every worker has the right to stop the process,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure to keep up production was intense, however, according to James Goggins, who worked at the Danville plant for more than 20 years before retiring in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials from Goodyear’s headquarters in Akron, Ohio, “would call down to Danville all the time, and all they would do is check the numbers,” Goggins said. “They were more interested in making the production numbers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goggins and other former Goodyear workers in Danville recalled how water leaked through the roof and gushed through manholes when it rained. Workers are trained to avoid moisture in the production process because it can prompt tire treads to separate, causing a blowout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can look down and see that water is shooting up from the floor like fire hydrants and flooding the department,” Goggins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it rained, workers said they would call maintenance crews to drape tarps over the equipment, draining the water into dumpsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there is a roof leak in a facility – and I’m not going to say we don’t have roof leaks in a facility – that local management team will put a process in place to fix the roof leak,” Jones said. “There are also processes in place, safety systems in place, to make sure people are not in a hazardous situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That claim means nothing to Gerri Hall, who visits his daughter’s grave every Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Goodyear doesn’t care about life. They just want to make that money and let their CEOs get their big bonuses. Let’s just throw out as many tires as we can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

All of the sidewall markings related to tire service (load capacity, corresponding inflation pressure, etc.) are correct. Even though the tires were labeled incorrectly as “TREAD 4 PLIES STEEL CORD” on one side of the tires, the tires were manufactured with “TREAD 5 PLIES STEEL CORD”, which is correctly marked on the opposite tire sidewall. The mislabeling of these tires is not a safety concern and also has no impact on the retreading and recycling industries. The affected tire mold has already been corrected and all future production will have the correct number of plies shown on both sidewalls.</P><P id=""p-16"" data-page=""18210"">Goodyear noted that NHTSA has previously granted petitions for the same noncompliance related to tire construction information on tires because of surveys that show most consumers do not base purchases on tire construction information found on the tire sidewall.</P><P id=""p-17"" data-page=""18210"">Goodyear concluded by expressing the belief that the subject noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and that its petition to be exempted from providing notification of the noncompliance, as required by <A class=""usc external"" href=""https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=49&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=30118&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html"" target=""_blank"">49 U.S.C. 30118</A>, and a remedy for the noncompliance, as required by <A class=""usc external"" href=""https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=49&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=30120&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html"" target=""_blank"">49 U.S.C. 30120</A>, should be granted.</P><P id=""p-18"" data-page=""18210"">NHTSA's Decision:</P><P id=""p-19"" data-page=""18210""><EM>NHTSA's Analysis:</EM> The agency agrees with Goodyear that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. The agency believes that one measure of inconsequentiality to motor vehicle safety is that there is no effect of the noncompliance on the operational safety of vehicles on which these tires are mounted. Another measure of inconsequentiality which is relevant to this petition is the safety of people working in the tire retread, repair and recycling industries.</P><P id=""p-20"" data-page=""18210"">Although tire construction affects the strength and durability of tires, neither the agency nor the tire industry provides information relating tire strength and durability to the number of plies and types of ply cord material in the tread sidewall. Therefore, tire dealers and customers should consider the tire construction information along with other information such as the load capacity, maximum inflation pressure, and tread wear, temperature, and traction ratings, to assess performance capabilities of various tires. In the agency's judgement, the incorrect labeling of the tire construction information will have an inconsequential effect on motor vehicle safety because most consumers do not base tire purchases or vehicle operation parameters on the number of plies in a tire.</P><P id=""p-21"" data-page=""18210"">The agency also believes the noncompliance will have no measureable effect on the safety of the tire retread, repair, and recycling industries. The use of steel cord construction in the sidewall and tread is the primary safety concern of these industries.

Accordingly, Goodyear's petition is hereby granted and Goodyear is consequently exempted from the obligation of providing notification of, and a free remedy for, that noncompliance under <A class=""usc external"" href=""https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=49&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=30118&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html"" target=""_blank"">49 U.S.C. 30118</A> and 30120.</P><P id=""p-23"" data-page=""18211"">NHTSA notes that the statutory provisions (<A class=""usc external"" href=""https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=49&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=30118&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html"" target=""_blank"">49 U.S.C. 30118</A>(d) and 30120(h)) that permit manufacturers to file petitions for a determination of inconsequentiality allow NHTSA to exempt manufacturers only from the duties found in sections 30118 and 30120, respectively, to notify owners, purchasers, and dealers of a defect or noncompliance and to remedy the defect or noncompliance. Therefore, this decision only applies to the subject tires that Goodyear no longer controlled at the time it determined that the noncompliance existed. However, the granting of this petition does not relieve equipment distributors and dealers from the prohibitions on the sale, offer for sale, or introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of the noncompliant tires under their control after Goodyear notified them that the subject noncompliance exists.</P><SPAN class=""authority-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper""><SPAN class=""authority unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup"" data-tooltip-template=""#regtext-auth-tooltip-template"" data-tooltip-doc-override=""tooltip-enhanced"" data-text=""Start Authority""><SPAN class=""text"">Start Authority</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><P class=""authority"" id=""p-24"" data-page=""18211""><SPAN class=""auth-header"">Authority:</SPAN><SPAN class=""auth-content"">(<A class=""usc external"" href=""https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=49&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=30118&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html"" target=""_blank"">49 U.S.C. 30118</A>, 30120: delegations of authority at <A class=""cfr external"" href=""/select-citation/2017/04/17/49-CFR-1.95"">49 CFR 1.95</A> and 501.8)</SPAN></P><SPAN class=""authority-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper""><SPAN class=""authority unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup"" data-tooltip-template=""#regtext-auth-tooltip-template"" data-tooltip-doc-override=""tooltip-enhanced"" data-text=""End Authority""><SPAN class=""text"">End Authority</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""signature-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper""><SPAN class=""signature unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup"" data-tooltip-template=""#signature-tooltip-template"" data-tooltip-doc-override=""tooltip-enhanced"" data-text=""Start Signature""><SPAN class=""text"">Start Signature</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><DIV class=""signature""><P class=""signature-title"">Director, Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance.</P></DIV><SPAN class=""signature-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper""><SPAN class=""signature unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup"" data-tooltip-template=""#signature-tooltip-template"" data-tooltip-doc-override=""tooltip-enhanced"" data-text=""End Signature""><SPAN class=""text"">End Signature</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""supplemental-info-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper""><SPAN class=""supplemental-info unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup"" data-tooltip-template=""#suplinf-tooltip-template"" data-tooltip-doc-override=""tooltip-enhanced"" data-text=""End Supplemental Information""><SPAN class=""text"">End Supplemental Information</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><DIV class=""end-matter""><P class=""frdoc"">[FR Doc. <A href=""/a/2017-07615"">2017-07615</A> Filed 4-14-17; 8:45 am]</P><P class=""billing-code"">BILLING CODE 4910-59-P</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The company credits its work with Sandia for reducing new product development times, improving manufacturing methods and lowering both technical and operational costs.</P><P>Ted Blacker, Sandia’s manager of Simulation Modeling Sciences, said the partnership has been successful because it is strategic. “We focus on strategic technical challenges where advanced technology from both sides can change the future,” he said. “Almost without fail, the new capabilities they commission us to develop, for example, to model rotating, twisting and deforming tires, help us with simulations in our national security work.”</P><DIV style=""max-width: 260px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text""><STRONG>This simulation shows the detailed tread mesh of a tire.</STRONG> (Image courtesy of The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company) Click on the thumbnail for a high-resolution image.</P></DIV><P>Sandia and Goodyear signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, in 1993, back when technology transfer from the national labs was in its nascent stage. In 1980, the Stevenson-Wydler Technology <mark>Innovation</mark> Act was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter, becoming the first major U.S. technology transfer legislation. It required federal laboratories to actively participate in and budget for technology transfer activities.</P><P>Stevenson-Wydler was followed by the Federal Technology Act of 1986, the second major piece of legislation focused on tech transfer from federal government agencies to the private sector. It established the Federal Laboratory Consortium and let federal labs enter into CRADAs with private industry.</P><P>“Tech transfer was an exciting new opportunity for the labs,” said Mary Monson, senior manager of Technology Partnerships at Sandia. “The Department of Energy really embraced the tech transfer concept for federal agencies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Part of the defense programs budget was put aside for U.S. economic security for the nation as well as enhancing the capabilities of the labs through solving complex real-world problems. Labs identified their capabilities and were authorized to collaborate with partners.”</P><H3>Using computational mechanics to design the ideal tire</H3><P>Goodyear took note, reaching out to Sandia in 1992, and the two organizations forged a relationship through back-and-forth visits to each other’s sites.</P><DIV style=""max-width: 260px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text""><STRONG>Nascar cornering design is shown in this tire simulation.</STRONG> (Image courtesy of The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company) Click on the thumbnail for a high-resolution image.</P></DIV><P>“They looked at our advanced computational mechanics software developed for nuclear weapons programs after the government halted underground testing and saw that they could be applied to tires. Instead of building and testing three to five prototypes before a tire was ready for manufacture, they could use our computer codes to develop one,” Monson said. “Time to market a new design was dramatically reduced, by half or more.”</P><P>Sandia’s tools went to work on the many components of a tire system. “Modeling the pneumatic tire for performance and handling predictions was a challenge in several computational mechanics areas, including composites modeling, contact mechanics and rubber material behavior,” said Sandia technical lead Martin Heinstein. “The mechanics and solvability challenges aligned well with Sandia’s need to develop code for large-scale, massively parallel platforms.”</P><P>“It’s often surprising to people to learn just how complicated it is to model and simulate tire performance, considering millions of material combinations and permutations and blending structural mechanics, rigid body and fluid dynamics under varying temperature, pressure and wear conditions,” said Dale Moseley, Goodyear’s global project manager.</P><H3>A distinctive tire</H3><P>An early victory for the collaboration was the Assurance TripleTred, a unique all-weather tire with a three-part tread compound. Goodyear wanted a visually distinctive tire that would generate buzz and demonstrate its best technology. The Assurance line was launched in 2004, and in 2005 Sandia and Goodyear won a joint R&amp;D 100 Award for the tires, particularly the TripleTred, which was brought from concept to market in less than a year. Goodyear said the tire could not have been produced without modeling and predictive testing tools developed with Sandia.</P><P>A wide range of lab technologies has played a role in the CRADA, including advanced computational mechanics, sophisticated geometry and meshing, computational simulation and verification, elastomeric materials, structural and tire dynamics, advanced manufacturing of rubber products, efficient characterization methods for structural dynamics, reliability tools for manufacturing processes, sensor systems, data science, human reliability and engineered products.</P><P>“Our relationship with Sandia has been very beneficial in our competitive success in the global automotive industry, allowing us to begin submitting ‘virtual tires’ to automakers that can be incorporated into their vehicle models early in the development process as they tune the vehicle designs,” Moseley said.</P><DIV style=""max-width: 260px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text""><STRONG>A snow tire’s performance is detailed in this simulation.</STRONG> (Image courtesy of The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company) Click on the thumbnail for a high-resolution image.</P></DIV><P>The CRADA has been renewed repeatedly since 1993. Much research done under the CRADA has been applied to Sandia’s science-based nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship mission.</P><P>“So many good things have come out of this enduring partnership,” Monson said. “It has worked both ways. We were able to apply our codes to a real-world problem, and improve our codes. And Goodyear was able to develop revolutionary products.”</P><P>The work with Goodyear led to a deeper appreciation at Sandia of the value of computer modeling in the early stages of development.</P><P>“We showed that modeling and simulation made a difference in developing better products faster,” Blacker said. “Our computational tools typically were used late in the process to understand why something broke and how to fix it. Now we use modeling more in the up-front stages, such as in the early design, to reduce testing.”</P><P>Monson said CRADAs are an important technology transfer tool. “They help us sustain and improve our capabilities because we’re applying our technology to a company’s pressing problems,” she said. “There’s an urgency. It’s not abstract.”</P><P>She said the Goodyear CRADA has allowed Sandia researchers to work with peers in industry and share best practices. “It really is collaborative,” she said. “Both teams bring a different way of looking at a problem. We have learned a lot through those interactions about how to approach problems differently.”</P><P>Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory operated by National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration. Sandia Labs has major research and development responsibilities in nuclear deterrence, global security, defense, energy technologies and economic competitiveness, with main facilities in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Livermore, California.</P><P><STRONG>Sandia news media contact: </STRONG>Sue Holmes, <A href=""mailto:sholmes@sandia.gov"">sholmes@sandia.gov</A>, (505) 844-6362</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV><ASIDE id=""sideBar"" class=""clearfix""><SECTION id=""searchBox"" class=""boxStyle1""><H3>Search Articles</H3></SECTION></ASIDE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Here’s the good: Michelin, the world’s largest buyer of natural rubber, says the deforestation has to stop and it’s pledging to go green. It’s still early, a work in progress, but<A href=""http://time.com/4391096/rubber-deforestation/""> environmental groups</A> are praising Michelin. Higonnet says Michelin’s shift in tone is huge.</P><P>“I think it’s a game changer. Now that Michelin has opened the door, other companies will feel some pressure to walk through and join on that path of sustainability, if only because there is growing scrutiny.”</P><P>Other tire companies may well follow Michelin’s lead.</P><P>“It may be that they’re worried about reputational risk or alternatively hoping that really committing to sustainability will give them an advantage with consumers,” says Harvard business school professor <A href=""http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=12345"">Rebecca Henderson</A>.</P><P>That has certainly played out in other industries. California-based clothing brand Patagonia has long been a leader in its commitment to the environment, and other companies have followed its example. Now, Patagonia is also<A href=""http://www.patagonia.com/yulex-natural-rubber-wetsuits.html?utm_source=em&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=081216_yulex&amp;ett=1641496896&amp;dtm_em=0B38E0ABE2F3B63AE93C5E0C30650A43""> turning its attention to rubber</A> with its wetsuits.  </P><P>“Just looking to build the most environmentally benign suit on the market,” says Jason McCaffrey at Patagonia. “We joke here, that you can get any color here as long as it’s black.”</P><P>And now, as long as it's made from sustainablly-harvested rubber. Patagonia’s new wetsuits will now use only rubber from trees harvested in Guatemala, and soon Sri Lanka, in accordance with principles designed by the Forest Stewardship Council and certified by the Rainforest Alliance.</P><P>“Which is a lot of words that means it prevents any new deforestation or clearcutting from occurring,” says McCaffrey. </P><DIV class=""media media-element-container media-original_image""><DIV id=""file-163226"" class=""file file-image file-image-jpeg""><DIV class=""content""><DIV class=""field-caption""><P>Jason McCaffrey, left, and Hector Castro of Patagonia look at one of the company's wetsuits at the company's headquarters in Ventura, Calif. </P></DIV><DIV class=""image__credit""><SPAN class=""image__credit-label"">

(Patagonia’s wet suits range in price from about $300 to $500.) “I think it’s a bearable amount for people to pay extra, knowing that where their suit came from doesn’t contribute to deforestation.”</P><P>Patagonia is banking on that. This year, it has more than doubled production to keep up with early demand projections.</P><DIV class=""media media-element-container media-default""><DIV id=""file-163218"" class=""file file-video file-video-oembed oembed-video oembed-default oembed-youtube""><H2 class=""element-invisible oembed-title""><A href=""/file/patagonia-yulex-winter-2016"">Patagonia Yulex Winter 2016</A></H2></DIV></DIV><P>Studies have shown that people will pay 30 percent extra for fair trade coffee. But will they pay more for greener tires? </P><P>&quot;The short answer is: I don't think anybody knows,&quot; says Harvard's Rebecca Henderson. But she adds that switching to sustainably-grown rubber won’t hurt Michelin's business.</P><P>“The thing that the environmentalists say, which is we can behave better and it wouldn’t be that much more expensive, and is sometimes cheaper, turns out ... to be often true.”</P><P>I tried to find out if Michelin’s new tires might cost more, but the company didn’t answer that question, or any of my questions.</P><P>Overall, Michelin’s marketing team <A href=""http://en.purchasing.michelin.com/<mark>Sustainable</mark>-Purchasing2/Responsible-and-<mark>Sustainable</mark>-Management-of-Natural-Rubber"">hasn’t really been playing up its new <mark>sustainable</mark> rubber policy</A>. It’s curious to many, especially when <A href=""http://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/wwf-statement-on-new-zero-deforestation-policy-from-michelin"">environmental groups are praising</A> the company.</P><P>McCaffery with Patagonia was similarly confused by Michelin’s relative silence. He called Michelin’s new stance “a gigantic step forward for the entire rubber industry,” and didn’t know why the company isn’t touting it more. “I don’t know, to me it’s an opportunity missed.”</P><P>Michelin does have a checkered past with environmental groups that have dogged the company for contributing to deforestation, and those groups still <A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/africa/en/Press-Centre-Hub/Greenpeace-Michelin-Zero-Deforestation-Commitment/"">want to ensure Michelin's compliance</A>. Perhaps Michelin wants the whole rubber issue, even when it’s good news, to just go away. It’s hard to say. </P><DIV class=""media media-element-container media-original_image""><DIV id=""file-163224"" class=""file file-image file-image-jpeg""><DIV class=""content""><DIV class=""field-caption""><P>A forest area in Xayabouri, Laos cleared to plant rubber trees.  </P></DIV><DIV class=""image__credit""><SPAN class=""image__credit-label"">

Use of the best available science would not have resulted in the conclusion that BENPAT &quot;is entering or may enter the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that have or may have an immediate or long-term harmful effect on the environment or its biological diversity.&quot;<SUP id=""fn4-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn4""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>4</A></SUP> Inappropriately, the approach used in the Assessment erroneously:</P><UL><LI>assumes BENPAT does not degrade quickly in the environment and is persistent in water, soil, and sediments so to pose a risk;</LI><LI>uses overstated industrial release factors to calculate overstated exposure scenarios resulting in risk quotients (&quot;RQs&quot;) erroneously indicating BENPAT has the potential to cause ecological harm; and</LI><LI>uses combinations of release and dilution factors to generate overstated exposure scenarios from consumer releases that appear unlikely and physically impossible to occur, which erroneously indicates BENPAT has the potential to cause ecological harm.</LI></UL><P>Important new data relevant to Environment Canada's Assessment have become available that challenge Environment Canada's persistence designation of BENPAT. Since the release of the Assessment, recently completed degradation studies show that the material, when bio-available, is readily degradable by bacteria. An ongoing study, to be concluded in early 2012, shows evidence of rapid degradation for BENPAT. These studies, using radio-labeled material, demonstrate that the majority of the bio-available material is mineralized to <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) in days and the biomass-bound material is so tightly bound as to be immobilized, biologically unavailable, and thus posing no risk of immediate or long term harmful effect to the environment or its biological diversity.</P><P>Environment Canada's Assessment conclusion for industrial releases was based on the risk quotients derived from two emissions scenarios applied to three unidentified sites, but neither scenario considered current risk management measures. In July of 2010, Goodyear submitted a sample calculation with emissions factors based on European Tyre and Rubber Manufacturers' Association (ETRMA) guidance and consistent with what was ultimately used in Scenario 2 of the Assessment, but noted that ETRMA was in the process of completing an emission factor study for European tire facilities which would provide more reliable information. Emission rates inclusive of current industry-wide risk management measures are now available online (ETRMA, 2010)<SUP id=""fn5-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn5""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>5</A></SUP>. As discussed in more detail below, risk quotients (RQs) extrapolated from these factors recommended by ETRMA are all less than 1 and conclude no risk of immediate or long term harmful effect to the environment or its biological diversity.</P><P>In the Assessment, it is reported that predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for BENPAT under two scenarios may exceed the PNEC (predicted no effect concentrations) in a small percentage of the water bodies receiving wastewater across Canada under lowest flow conditions (10% quartile). Releases from many consumer products are equally likely in dry and wet times due to downthe- drain sources, but not for tires. Tire wear particles deposited along the roadway represent the primary possible release source, and substantial roadway runoff is unlikely during dry periods. Environment Canada in its Assessment used a proprietary spreadsheet, Mega Flush, to calculate potential environmental concentrations from consumer use of tires. It is not clearly apparent that the inherent differences between tires and other consumer products are taken into account in the modeling. A traditional application of a down-the-drain model would be inappropriate for tire modeling releases and generate overstated risk results. Conditions that cannot physically occur should not be included in the risk assessment.</P></DIV><DIV class=""mwsbodytext text parbase section""><H2>Background</H2><P>Underlying the Proposed Order is a finding by the Minister of the Environment that BENPAT meets the CEPA section 64 definition of &quot;toxic&quot;. Under Section 64 of CEPA, a substance is &quot;toxic&quot; if it is entering or may enter the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that:</P><UL><LI>have or may have an immediate or long-term harmful effect on the environment or its biological diversity; or</LI><LI>constitute or may constitute a danger to the environment on which life depends; or</LI><LI>constitute or may constitute a danger in Canada to human life or health.</LI></UL><P>Pursuant to section 74 of CEPA, the Ministers of the Environment and Health prepared an Assessment for BENPAT, and the conclusion of the Assessment forms the basis of the Proposed Order. With respect to potential human health impacts, the Ministers concluded that BENPAT is not &quot;entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that constitute or may constitute a danger in Canada to human life or health.&quot;<SUP id=""fn6-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn6""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>6</A></SUP> Thus, BENPAT was not deemed to meet the CEPA section 64 definition of toxic based on human health concerns.</P><P>With respect to environmental concerns, the Ministers identified BENPAT as meeting the persistence criteria established in the Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations in certain environmental compartments. But the final Assessment concluded that there is sufficient consistent evidence that the material does not meet the bioaccumulation criterion. The Ministers concluded that long term exposure &quot;may cause adverse effects to aquatic organisms in certain Canadian environments.&quot;<SUP id=""fn7-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn7""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>7</A></SUP> BENPAT was deemed to satisfy the CEPA section 64 definition of toxic based on an assertion that they are &quot;entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that have or may have an immediate long-term harmful effect on the environment or its biological diversity&quot;.</P></DIV><DIV class=""mwsbodytext text parbase section""><H2>Objection to the proposed order</H2><P>Goodyear believes the conclusion regarding environmental concerns and the resulting Proposed Order are not consistent with the best available science. Further information concerning the basis for Goodyear's objection and request for a board of review follows.</P></DIV><DIV class=""mwsbodytext text parbase section""><H3>1. The proposed order is inconsistent with the Cabinet Directive on Streamlining Regulations as it is not based on the best available science.</H3><P>The Cabinet Directive on Streamlining Regulations specifies that the Government shall make decisions on &quot;the best available knowledge and science in Canada and worldwide&quot;.<SUP id=""fn8-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn8""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>8</A></SUP> In this case, the assessment prepared by Environment Canada is not based on the best available data and scientific knowledge regarding the environmental properties of BENPAT.</P><P>To accurately evaluate the ecological impacts of BENPAT, an understanding of whether BENPAT will actually be present and bio-available in which compartments (e.g., air, water, sediment) and at what levels is required. In its Assessment, Environment Canada relied on overly conservative modeling that predicts BENPAT will not degrade in the aquatic compartment and that material in the soil/sediment compartments is bio-available so to pose a risk. New data have become available from best-practice scientific studies demonstrating BENPAT's fate using radio-labeling. These data are reviewed below. Preliminary data are provided from one study that is expected to be completed in early 2012.</P></DIV><DIV class=""mwsbodytext text parbase section""><H4>a. BENPAT is rapidly biodegradable.</H4><P>Biodegradation studies for BENPAT constituent <SUP>14</SUP>C-R898, conducted at 2 suspended solids concentrations, indicate half-lives of &lt;10 days at both levels (<A href=""#fig1"">see Figure 1</A> in Addendum). While it may be questioned whether BENPAT achieves ready biodegradation status per Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines, it now meets &quot;inherent biodegradable&quot; status and should not be classified as persistent. Globally Harmonized System (GHS) has established criteria for substances tested at low concentrations in test media as was the case for BENPAT (10- and 100 ug R898/L). GHS guidance states that chemicals that degrade when tested at low concentrations will likely exhibit first-order kinetics, and a rate that achieves 70% degradation in 28 days is one that exhibits a half-life of &lt;16 days. The half-life estimates for BENPAT in two studies (<A href=""#fig1"">Figures 1</A>&amp;<A href=""#fig2"">figure 2</A>) demonstrate support for conclusions that criteria are met for &quot;rapidly biodegradable&quot; according to GHS, and &quot;inherent biodegradability&quot; per OECD.</P><P>In contrast, Environment Canada indicated that through means of modeling, half-lives in aqueous media for the components of BENPAT would exceed 182 days while soil half-lives would exceed 360 days. The new data derived from biodegradation tests of a BENPAT constituent R898 clearly demonstrates both a significant degree of mineralization and a half-life below 10 days in aqueous media. This evidence refutes the conclusions contained in the final assessment of BENPAT regarding prolonged persistence of this chemical in the environment.</P></DIV><DIV class=""mwsbodytext text parbase section""><H4>b. BENPAT'S low water solubility and its influence on biodegradation rates, aquatic toxicity, and partitioning to biomass (<A href=""#fig3"">Figure 3</A>).</H4><P>BENPAT was found to exhibit toxicity towards aquatic species (algae, daphnia, fish) with EC5Os &lt;0.5 mg/L. Exposures in these tests were chemically analyzed with data representing watersoluble chemical concentrations in the aquatic environments. In contrast, toxicity results for soil and/or sediment species (earthworm and chironomid) indicated negligible effects on these target organisms at levels -- 1000 mg/kg. A measurement of soluble levels of BENPAT in the overlying water layer in the chironomid study demonstrated an absence of soluble BENPAT, which comports with the assertion that the chemical partitions from water to the solid phase of the sediment. These observations in combination with the elevated Koc values for the constituents of BENPAT suggest that there is extensive adsorption of BENPAT to sediment to a degree that negates toxic activity in resident species.</P><P>Another test that characterizes biological behavior of soluble phase BENPAT is the biodegradation assay. It is reasonable to expect that only soluble fraction chemical is susceptible to microbial bioaccumulation with potential biodegradation in the STP incubation environment. Pilot data have been submitted to Canada that show ultimate biodegradation (to <SUP>14</SUP>CO<SUB>2</SUB>) of BENPAT up to levels exceeding 30% of applied chemical within 28 days (<A href=""#fig1"">Figure 1</A>). The biodegradation rates achieve plateau levels with evidence that the microbial population remains viable. This latter observation is confirmed through addition of test compound to the incubation media with resumption of biodegradative activity. Preliminary evidence from mass balance trials shows that a substantial fraction of the administered BENPAT not degraded is partitioned to biomass within the incubation chambers. The nature of this partitioning was characterized as non-extractable material using the strong organic solvent methylene chloride. It is therefore logical to deduce that radioactive R898 from BENPAT added to biodegradative media has the following 3 disposition options:</P><OL><LI>It is ultimately biodegraded to <SUP>14</SUP>CO<SUB>2</SUB>,</LI><LI>It is subject to primary biodegradation that leads to metabolite binding to biomass without a potential for further degradation, or</LI><LI>Primary degradation occurs with incorporation of '4C into intermediary metabolic pathways leading to lipid, protein or other biomolecules.</LI></OL><P><STRONG>It is possible that the parent test chemical could adhere to biomass without bond creation, but this type of non-covalent adherence would certainly be such that test compound radioactivity would be extractable by organic solvents, which in the case of BENPAT was not.</STRONG></P><P>Other published studies have shown that aromatic amines bind covalently to humic acids under ambient conditions, particularly to quinone components<SUP id=""fn9-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn9""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>9</A>,</SUP><SUP id=""fn10-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn10""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>10</A></SUP>. It is opined by the latter paper's authors that this type of binding between aromatic amines and humic acid may reduce the chemicals' hioavailability and toxicity to soil-dwelling species. While evidence for potential binding between sediment-soil/humic acids and BENPAT is limited and circumstantial, further support could be developed through conduct of acute aquatic toxicity (daphnia) in presence and absence of sediment. This testing should employ analytical assessments of aquatic levels and time-course of soluble concentrations of BENPAT in the test media. Attenuation of toxicity in the presence of sediment in parallel with a decrease in water-soluble levels of BENPAT would provide prima facie evidence for the ameliorative impact of BENPAT in the real-world environmental conditions in which the universal presence of sediment is a constant for aquatic species.</P><P>In concert with consideration of solvent non-extractability of chemicals from soil and sediment matrices, the German UBA (German Federal Environment Agency) is developing a structure that addresses mobility of these substances and the associated risks resulting from attenuated accessibility of chemicals to biological species. Categories are being developed according to risk associated with levels of mobility of chemicals based upon solvent extractability. In essence, the first category represents substances that can be removed from environmental substrates (soil, sediment) through mild extraction methods, and are considered to pose some biological risk as a result of a substances' mobilization from the matrix, ie., they are bioavailable. A second chemical category is for materials that cannot he mobilized from soil/sediment through a protocol of extractive measures that demonstrate strong binding and a lack of mobility. This suggests minimal risks as a result of low bioavailability. Further characterization may determine whether there is covalent binding of the test compound or biogenic incorporation into biomass structures such as lipids, membranes, carbohydrates, etc. Extraction results to date as well as mass balance determinations in progress for BENPAT and R898 indicate a high degree of non-mobility from biomass. If confirmed, this information indicates the chemical exists in low risk situations when present in biological environments such as those soil, sediment or aquatic matrices.</P></DIV><DIV class=""mwsbodytext text parbase section""><H4>c. Weight of evidence and environmental risks of BENPAT</H4><P>Data development for BENPAT has progressed in recent years through the use of a radioactive constituent plus methodologies to maximize the fraction of chemical in the water-soluble phase in biodegradation testing. This has led to significant enhancements of the characterizations of this chemical. To summarize:</P><UL><LI>Biodegradation tests clearly show substantial degree of ultimate biodegradation:</LI><LI>Half-life estimate values fall within ranges considered to be &quot;rapidly biodegradable&quot; (GHS) and &quot;inherent biodegradability&quot; [Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH)]; and</LI><LI>Elevated Koc values plus disparities for toxicity potencies found for aquatic species (tests in soluble fractions of BENPAT) versus those for soil and sediment species (presence of solid substrates) indicate strong evidence for presence of attenuating influence of real world conditions (e.g., presence of sediment in aquatic environment) towards toxicity of BENPAT in aquatic species.</LI></UL><P><STRONG>It is reasonable to conclude that according to best available data for BENPAT as cited above, weight-of-evidence and scientific judgment for this chemical point to the absence of threat to the environment under use conditions.</STRONG></P></DIV><DIV class=""mwstext section""><FIGURE><P id=""fig1""><STRONG>Figure 1</STRONG></P><DETAILS><SUMMARY>Description of figure 1</SUMMARY><P id=""image-desc"">Figure 1.

RQs for Scenario 1 were 1.9 to 150.7 and were 0.1 to 7.5 for Scenario 2. In a July 22, 2010, comment document, Goodyear submitted a sample calculation with emissions factors consistent with Scenario 2, but noted that ETRMA was in the process of completing an emission factor study for European tire facilities which would provide more reliable information.

The study included analysis of 6-PPD, CBS and DPG. which provide a reasonable basis for read-across of emissions factors.

The review (p. 22) indicated the preparation of emission factor guidance was completed in a transparent and scientifically sound manner. Based on the methodology used and review process, these guidance represent the best available data representative of the current controls and should have be included in the Assessment.</P><P>The ETRMA guidance provides three tiers of emission factors. The guidance was organized in tiers to fit within the framework that had been proposed for registration, evaluation and authorization of chemicals (REACH) exposure assessment. The first tier (Tier 0) is based on the REACH default for Environmental Release Categories (ERCs), which are considered to be beyond worst case in most cases. The second tier (Tier 1) is based on the European Risk Assessment Technical Guidance Document A-Tables. These factors do not take into account risk management measures. The final tier (Tier 2) emission factors are based on measured European data collected in 2010, and considered to be most reliable for use in risk assessment. These factors reflect actual measured emission rates inclusive of industry-wide risk management measures.</P><P>We note that ETRMA did not adopt the emission factors corresponding to Environment Canada Scenario 1, which were derived from the OECD Emission Scenario Document for the Rubber Industry. As discussed by ETRMA (2010), these factors were determined based on a survey by the Association of the German Rubber Industry that asked about the fraction of additives remaining after processing and curing. These factors are believed in the industry to greatly overstate the true emission rate because they are not based on measured data and the approach used was neither well described nor transparent.</P><P>The ETRMA Tier 2 factors were not considered in the Environment Canada screening assessment. Given that, the assessment did not utilize measured emission factors recommended by ETRMA, which are the best available. The RQs that would have been derived using ETRMA Tier 2 emission factors are presented in <A href=""#tab1"">Table 1</A>. Some emission factors depend on annual usage. The annual usage of each site is unknown but has been assumed as indicated in the table.

Gilberto’s vocal performance won her a Grammy award. But that fame was not enough to win a lawsuit she brought in 2001 for infringement of alleged trademark rights in her vocal performance, when the song was used in a Frito-Lay television commercial. Although Gilberto owned no copyrights in the underlying song or performance, she claimed she had become identified by the public with the recording and that she had acquired trademark rights in the song, requiring the advertiser to obtain her consent. Without such consent, she argued, use of the recording capitalized on her reputation and was likely to cause confusion as to her affiliation with, or endorsement of, Frito-Lay.</P><DIV><H2>A song as signifier of the singer? </H2></DIV><P>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (New York) upheld a dismissal of Gilberto’s trademark claim based on a false endorsement, on the grounds that a fact-finder “could not reasonably find an implied endorsement.” The district court had, however, also issued a broader ruling that “there is no federal [trademark] protection for a musical work,” because such works are otherwise protected by copyright law. The Court of Appeals rejected this broad proposition, and held instead that musical compositions could indeed be eligible for trademark protection as “a symbol or device to identify a person’s goods or services,” just as graphic designs can serve as trademarks and still be protected by copyright. Nevertheless, the Court rejected Gilberto’s remaining trademark and dilution claims, because there was no precedent to support the argument that a performing artist “acquires a trademark or service mark signifying <SPAN style=""font-style: italic;"">herself</SPAN> in a recording of her own famous recording.”</P><P style=""float: left; width: 156px; margin-right: 6px;""><SMALL>Nancy Sinatra claimed that she had made the song <SPAN style=""font-style: italic;"">These Boots are Made for Walkin’</SPAN> so popular that her name had become associated with it.  (Courtesy of Boots Enterprises, Inc.)</SMALL></P><P>This conclusion was based on a 1970 decision in the Ninth Circuit (California) in a case brought by Nancy Sinatra against Goodyear Tire for its use of the song <SPAN style=""font-style: italic;"">These Boots Are Made for Walkin’</SPAN>. Goodyear properly licensed its use of the song from the copyright owners, and unknown singers sang the song in the advertisement.

The Sinatra court concluded that a musical composition could never serve</P><DIV><H2>False implied endorsement</H2></DIV><P>The Gilberto court acknowledged other cases where a performing artist’s “persona” had been protected against a false implication of an endorsement, but ruled that Frito-Lay’s use of the song had not taken Gilberto’s persona to imply that she endorsed the product. The court concluded that, while it would not be unthinkable for trademark law to grant a performing artist trademark protection in his or her signature performance, such an expansion of trademark law would require legislative action. Otherwise, granting such rights to singers would stifle commerce by allowing suits against parties who had otherwise properly licensed all known copyrights in a work from the owners of those rights. </P><P style=""float: right; margin-left: 6px; width: 206px;""><SMALL>Tom Waits won a case for “false implied endorsement” (Photo: Wikipedia)</SMALL></P><P>Unlike Gilberto and Sinatra, the musical persona of Tom Waits was sufficient in a 1992 decision to grant him judgment on a false implied endorsement claim against a company that used a “copycat” singer, who imitated Waits’ distinctive raspy, gravelly singing style in a radio commercial praising snack-food products. Waits himself had never done commercials or endorsed any product; in fact, he believed strongly that musical artists should never do commercials. In that decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that Waits had a valid claim under California state law, where misappropriation of a singer’s distinctive voice was grounds for legal action (a spin-off of California’s broad right of publicity). On Waits’ false endorsement claim under the Lanham (Trademark) Act Section 43(a) (see box), the court held that “a celebrity whose endorsement of a product is implied through the imitation of a distinctive attribute of the celebrity’s identity […] has standing to sue for false endorsement.” Moreover, unlike with traditional false advertising claims, the celebrity need not be a competitor of the defendant. Finding that the jury had properly credited evidence of actual confusion between the stand-in singer and Waits himself, the court affirmed the judgment in favor of Waits. </P><DIV class=""table-02""><TABLE width=""100%"" border=""0""><TBODY><TR valign=""top""><TH>The Lanham Act – Section 43(a)</TH></TR><TR valign=""top""><TD>Section 43(a) of the U.S. Lanham (Trademark) Act forbids false designations of origin, false descriptions, and dilution.

            <P style=""font-style: italic;"">Any person who, in connection with any goods or services… uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device…or any false or misleading description …or representation of fact, which is likely to cause confusion … or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the… sponsorship, or approval of his/her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person, shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he/she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P> </P><H2>Misappropriation of a musical persona</H2><P>Back in 1988, the Ninth Circuit had considered claims by singer Bette Midler for misappropriation of persona under California common law when a sound-alike performer was used in a commercial after Midler had refused to participate. Although the court rejected Midler’s separate California statutory publicity claim because the voice used was not her real voice, it ruled that the other vocal imitation claims were not preempted by copyright law because the “thing” misappropriated, namely her voice, was not itself copyrightable. </P><P>In 2006, in the <SPAN style=""font-style: italic;"">Laws v. Sony Music Entertainment</SPAN> case, the Ninth Circuit clarified California’s common law for misappropriation claims and the interplay with copyright law, . [Recording artist Debra Laws sued Sony Music for misappropriation of her voice and invasion of privacy, complaining that Jennifer Lopez’ recording and video, <SPAN style=""font-style: italic;"">All I Have</SPAN> sampled Laws’ recording, <SPAN style=""font-style: italic;"">Very Special</SPAN>, without her consent.] The Court of Appeal held that Debra Laws’ state law claims were preempted by the federal Copyright Act because the claims were based only on reproductions of her songs, in which the artist’s voice was a part of a sound recording in a fixed, tangible medium, and so came within the subject matter of copyright.. The case did not, however, assert a false endorsement claim under the Lanham Act. The Laws court noted that, “in contrast to<SPAN style=""font-style: italic;""> Midler </SPAN>and <SPAN style=""font-style: italic;"">Waits</SPAN>, where the licensing party obtained only a license to the song and then imitated the artist’s voice, here Sony obtained a license [from the copyright holder, Electra Records] to use Laws’ recording itself. Sony was not imitating [the song] as Laws might have sung it. Rather, it used a portion of [the song] as sung by Debra Laws.” </P><DIV><H2>Non-music celebrity persona cases</H2></DIV><DIV>In the non-music celebrity persona context, the Ninth Circuit ruled in 2000 that use of a <SPAN style=""font-style: italic;"">Three Stooges</SPAN> film clip in a feature film did not constitute trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, even where the underlying copyright had fallen into the public domain. Although the plaintiff argued that the clip was particularly distinctive of <SPAN style=""font-style: italic;"">The Three Stooges</SPAN>’ comedy routine, the court held it was still within the scope of copyright. Calling the trademark claim a “fanciful argument,” the court concluded the case was unlike <SPAN style=""font-style: italic;"">Waits</SPAN> or other cases that had recognized celebrity persona claims. Those cases involved use of a performer’s persona, through sound-alikes or look-alikes, for commercial endorsements, rather than use of the exact work in which the artist’s original performance was embodied, the latter being within the exclusive domain of copyright.</DIV><DIV>
Two other prominent Ninth Circuit non-music persona cases upholding false endorsement-type claims bear mention. In 1992, a controversial case was brought by the actress Vanna White, when her likeness was used in a commercial by means of a robot made to look like her and cast in a set evoking the TV show <SPAN style=""font-style: italic;"">Wheel of Fortune</SPAN>, which she had co-hosted. The court found there were material issues that required a jury trial. Secondly, in 1997, the court decided in favor of two lead actors from the hit television series <SPAN style=""font-style: italic;"">Cheers</SPAN>, when their physical likenesses were embodied in robots that were placed in airport bars.
<P> </P><DIV><H2>California vs New York?</H2><P>The Waits decision, and later cases addressing the simulation of an artist’s voice or style, looks to alternative theories of false endorsement and to state misappropriation law in order to avoid conflicts with federal copyright law and preemption arguments. Because California, as distinguished from New York, recognizes broad statutory and common-law publicity rights, musical artists may have more opportunities to seek redress for imitative use of their performances or false endorsement claims under both state law and the Lanham Act in California courts. But both the Second and the Ninth circuits, sitting in New York and California, respectively, have recognized false endorsement cases under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act. As media technology advances, and imitative sound- and look-alikes become easier to create digitally, we will likely see further developments in this area.</P><DIV><H3>Cases cited:</H3></DIV><P><SPAN style=""font-style: italic;"">Oliveira a/k/a Gilberto v.
