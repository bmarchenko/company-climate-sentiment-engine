Lawyers acting on behalf of environmental and human rights campaigners against a major fracking company have lodged an appeal against an injunction which they believe impinges on the right to peaceful protest.
Lawyers acting for environmental activists Joseph Boyd, represented by law firm Leigh Day, and fellow campaigner, Joseph Corré, represented by Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, have lodged an appeal against the interim injunction granted to fracking company <mark>INEOS</mark> in July last year.  The injunction prevents individuals and campaign groups from being able to engage in certain forms of peaceful, and otherwise lawful, protest activity in relation to fracking, without the immediate threat of arrest and or a fine.
In an unprecedented decision last July, <mark>INEOS</mark>, a fracking company which has been awarded the most fracking licenses by the UK Government, was granted an injunction against campaigners, which applies not only to eight sites across England, where fracking is planned or under investigation by <mark>INEOS</mark>, but also to contractors, subcontractors and other entities which make up <mark>INEOS</mark>’‘supply chain’.
Under the terms of the current injunction, persons unknown are forbidden from ‘obstructing, impeding or interfering with the lawful activities’ of <mark>INEOS</mark> staff and their contractors. This prevents campaigners from engaging in a number of activities which had never previously been ruled to be unlawful. In particular, it contains what is effectively the first ever blanket ban on the tactic of slow-walking, which has long been a legitimate and legal form of peaceful protest.
Anyone who is found to have breached the injunction, including by slow-walking at one of the eight sites or in relation to any of the named contractors, is liable to arrest and a prison sentence of up to two years and/or a fine up to £5,000.
Joseph Boyd said: “The High Court judgment has wide ranging impacts on not only those involved in the campaign against <mark>climate change</mark> and fossil fuels, but also anyone who wishes to express opposition against any potentially controversial industry. “I don’t think that people should be constrained to banner waving and petition signing in order to protect the environment and the health of their families and future generations. I very much hope the Court of Appeal will agree to review the current injunction and properly uphold our right to peacefully protest, a core value in this country’s democratic history.”<A href=""/Our-experts/Senior-staff/Rosa-Curling"">Rosa Curling</A>, solicitor at law firm Leigh Day, said: “Free speech and a right to peacefully protest is at the heart of any effective democracy. The current injunction, which we are seeking to challenge in the Court of Appeal, has wide-ranging implications that reach far beyond any debate around the environmental damage of fracking. “This case represents the right that all of us have to stand up and say that we don’t agree with something without facing the fear of arrest and imprisonment.”<P><EM>Information was correct at time of publishing.

The legislation does not require that they purchase any land so landowners are always left with the liability of abandoned wells once the company has finished it’s operations. However the whole exploration and surveying process is extremely vulnerable to concerted local resistance and is the first opportunity a community has to resist the industry on the ground. Fracking companies need unfettered access to land across the whole survey area and an informed and organised community is in a very good position to deny this. By banding together and refusing access to lots of properties and causing disruption the cost of the survey can be greatly increased and in some cases stopped entirely. There are already some useful allies taking a stand including the <A href=""http://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/clumber-park-says-no-to-fracking-but-energy-firm-could-take-legal-action/story-30127143-detail/story.html"" class=""external"" rel=""nofollow"">National Trust at Clumber Park near Worksop</A>, who have said that they will not allow <mark>Ineos</mark> access.

A British company called <mark>Ineos</mark> has contracted with U.S.-based drilling companies to supply it with ethane, a gas liquid used to make plastics. And in order to deliver these liquids, Sunoco is building the 350-mile Mariner East 2 pipeline across the state. The pipeline ends at the Marcus Hook facility south of Philadelphia, where massive &quot;dragon ships&quot; owned by <mark>Ineos</mark> carry gas liquids to Norway and Scotland.</P><P>&quot;Fracking is creating a public health and <mark>climate</mark> disaster while propping the highly polluting plastics industry,&quot; said <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/community/wenonah_hauter/"">Wenonah Hauter</A>, executive director of Food &amp; Water Watch.</P><P>&quot;People on both sides of the Atlantic are suffering the costs, with extremely detrimental effects to our global environment—everything from air <mark>pollution</mark> and <mark>climate</mark> altering emissions to the proliferation of <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/tag/plastic-<mark>pollution</mark>"">plastic waste</A> can be tied to the companies benefiting from this poisonous process.&quot;</P><P>Shipping gas liquids to Europe will drive more fracking in Pennsylvania, with all the accompanying water and air <mark>pollution</mark> that has been well-documented over the last several years of drilling in the state. That drilling is the rationale behind the Mariner East 2. Though the project has been approved by state regulators, communities along the 350-mile route are fighting against the pipeline's construction through a mix of municipally-oriented strategies and nonviolent direct action tactics.</P><P>&quot;Sunoco Logistics, aka Energy Transfer Partners, continues to insist that it is providing a 'public benefit,' while in fact it is simply lining its pockets at the expense of the environment,&quot; said Ellen Gerhart, a Huntingdon County resident who has been resisting Sunoco's pipeline construction on her land.</P><P>&quot;We, as landowners facing eminent domain by this company, will continue to resist, and stand in solidarity with our friends in both the U.S. and Europe. The fight is not over.&quot;</P><P>The environmental hazards will be evident across the Atlantic, too. In Scotland, <mark>Ineos</mark> will be &quot;cracking&quot; the ethane to make ethylene, an industrial process that causes air <mark>pollution</mark> and creates additional plastic litter, like the small pellets called nurdles that are littering shorelines across the UK. Earlier this month, the <mark>Ineos</mark> petrochemical facility in Grangemouth, Scotland had a substantial ethylene leak that forced the evacuation of employees.</P><P>All of the companies involved in the trans-Atlantic pipeline, the report shows, have poor environmental records. The Grangemouth facility has been repeatedly cited by Scottish authorities for emissions and <mark>pollution</mark>s violations, along with workplace safety violations. One of the drilling companies in Pennsylvania, Range Resources—perhaps best known for a water contamination incident in Texas—has been fined almost $21 million by state regulators. The company has been charged with more than 500 health and safety violations between 2005 and 2016.</P><P>And Sunoco, according to one analysis, had a higher rate of oil spills than any of its competitors in the U.S. It recently completed a merger with Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the highly controversial <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/tag/dakota-access-pipeline"">Dakota Access pipeline</A>.</P><P>Food &amp; Water Watch offers several recommendations to communities and political leaders both sides of the Atlantic, starting with a complete ban on fracking everywhere, a ban on fossil fuel imports and ending fossil fuel infrastructure projects that are harming the environment and contributing to the mounting threats posed by <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/<mark>climate</mark>-change/""><mark>climate change</mark></A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""sPost_0_4_0_0_0_1_1_0_0_0_1_0_1"" class=""post-partial article__comments""><DIV class=""article-content__comments-wrapper""><DIV class=""action-btn js-toggle js--active"" data-target=""#comments-widget"" data-toggle-class=""hidden"">Show Comments (</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It has been <A href=""http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-history-of-fracking-2015-4?r=US&amp;IR=T"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">used</A> in the oil industry since the mid-20th century.</P><P>However, the technique has only recently become widespread in onshore gas extraction, after <A href=""http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-history-of-fracking-2015-4?r=US&amp;IR=T"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">advances in horizontal drilling</A> allowed it to be applied to shale resources.</P><P>The process began attracting <A href=""http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/energy-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change-committee/inquiries/shale-gas/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">attention</A> in the UK when the government <A href=""http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121030145704/http://og.decc.gov.uk/en/olgs/cms/licences/lic_rounds/13th_round/13th_round.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">granted</A> the first onshore exploratory licences for shale gas in 2008.</P><P>After the Blackpool tremors were identified in late 2011 as <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/02/fracking-cause-lancashire-quakes"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">likely</A> to have been caused by fracking, the UK’s then-Department of Energy and <mark>Climate Change</mark> (DECC) put a moratorium on the practise, until it was better understood.</P><P>This was lifted a year later by then-energy secretary Ed Davey, who said exploratory fracking for shale gas could resume, subject to new controls to minimise seismic risks.</P><P>The UK already uses small quantities of shale gas and oil. Anglo-Swiss firm <mark>Ineos</mark> began importing US shale ethane in September last year, for use in the chemical industry. The Isle of Grain terminal on the Thames estuary took the UK’s first delivery of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from US shale in <A href=""https://www.ft.com/content/f7ea9416-616e-11e7-8814-0ac7eb84e5f1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">early July</A>.</P><P>However, the North Sea still produces the <A href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/632523/Chapter_4.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">vast majority</A> of UK gas supplies. The UK is <A href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/07/05/national-grid-import-lng-us-shale-first-time/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">not expected</A> to be able to compete for US LNG with Asian markets, where prices are higher.</P><P>US LNG exports are growing, following a string of <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/06/29/the-white-house-labeled-this-energy-week-and-you-thought-it-was-all-healthcare/?utm_term=.3a01b9d8d558"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">approvals</A> granted by the Obama administration. As a result, the US is <A href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=32412"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">expected</A> to become a net exporter of gas later this year. Increasing fossil fuel exports is part of US president Donald Trump’s plan to achieve what he calls “<A href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-07-06/american-energy-superpower"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">energy dominance</A>“.</P><H4>When will fracking next take place?</H4><P>Cuadrilla expects to conduct exploratory fracking later this year at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire, the firm tells <mark>Carbon</mark> Brief.</P><P>Planning consent for Cuadrilla to explore for shale gas at the site using fracking was granted by the government in <A href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/10/06/fracking-by-cuadrilla-approved-at-one-lancashire-site-overruling/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">October 2016</A>, when it overruled <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/updated-two-plans-to-begin-first-fracking-operations-in-uk-for-four-years-rejected"">local councillors’ rejection</A>.</P><P>Cuadrilla started work at the site in January, with the main drilling rig <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/27/fracking-drilling-rig-smuggled-on-site-overnight-avoid-protests"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">brought on site</A> at the end of July. A spokeswoman for the firm tells <mark>Carbon</mark> Brief it plans to begin drilling horizontal wells into shale rock this month, with fracking beginning towards the end of the year.</P><P>However, the spokeswoman adds that Cuadrilla is unsure how long the process will take, since this is the first time horizontal wells have been drilled into the UK’s shale rock. (The Preese Hall site only had a vertical well). It, therefore, cannot say exactly when the first fracking will take place, she says.</P><P>Cuadrilla had originally planned to begin fracking by the third quarter of this year. An <A href=""http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/energy/2017/07/preston-new-road-how-fracking-protest-became-movement"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ongoing protest</A> at the site may be delaying development. Since January, <A href=""https://www.desmog.uk/2017/07/27/fracking-month-action-unites-local-and-national-campaigners-lancashire"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">anti-fracking protesters</A> have maintained a continuous presence outside the site.</P><P>A drilling rig owned by the firm was <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/10/drilling-rig-owned-uk-fracking-firm-cuadrilla-seriously-vandalised"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">vandalised</A> last month at a facility near Chesterfield, where it was being stored, while Cuadrilla recently <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/27/fracking-drilling-rig-smuggled-on-site-overnight-avoid-protests"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">breached</A> its planning permission by delivering a drilling rig overnight, apparently to evade the protestors.</P><P>If Cuadrilla does use fracking at the site, it would be the first time in the UK since the 2011 moratorium was put in place.</P><P>Cuadrilla also has an application for exploratory fracking at a second Lancashire site, Roseacre Wood. A public inquiry on the application is set to take place in April 2018, after a legal challenge by protesters <A href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-39622877"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">failed</A> to stop it going ahead.</P><P>It’s worth emphasising that Cuadrilla’s projects are at the exploratory stage and are not yet producing shale gas. However, Cuadrilla’s spokeswoman tells <mark>Carbon</mark> Brief that gas from its site will be “fuelling Lancashire homes and businesses mid next year”. This statement is based on Cuadrilla already having planning consent for an extended flow test, that would send small quantities of gas into the grid. Again, this would fall short of full-scale production.</P><H4>Where else are firms planning to use fracking?</H4><P>At least five other firms are planning to explore for shale gas in the UK. The interactive map below shows where they hope to operate. (Zoom in/out and mouse over or click on the dots for more information.)</P><P>Note that fracking is not necessarily set be used at all the sites shown on the map. Cuadrilla has said it will not need to carry out fracking at its oil exploration well at Balcombe, for example, since the rock is already naturally fractured. (It also says it has no current plans to continue exploration at this site, having decided to focus on shale gas extraction in Lancashire.)</P><P>(Update 24/8/2017: Note however that in a correspondence published this month in the journal <A href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v548/n7668/full/548393a.html?foxtrotcallback=true#auth-1"">Nature</A>, researchers David Smythe and Stuart Haszeldine warn fracking of unconventional oil and gas formations could risk being classed as conventional hydro<mark>carbon</mark> exploration, pointing to exploration in the Weald Basin, which Balcombe is situated within. “This results from the government using legally binding definitions of unconventional oil and gas (UOG) resources and of high-volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF, or fracking) that have little rational or scientific basis,” they write.)</P><P class=""p1"">(Update 10/1/2018: West Sussex county council’s planning committee <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/09/fracking-firm-gets-green-light-to-drill-for-oil-at-balcombe-again"">yesterday</A> voted unanimously to approve an application by Cuadrilla to explore for oil near Balcombe. The decision comes despite more than 2,700 objections being received against the proposal, with 11 in favour. It does not give Cuadrilla permission for fracking, which would require further consents.)</P><P>The map includes Cuadrilla’s Preston New Road and Roseacre Wood sites in Lancashire, the only ones for which the firm is currently seeking permission to carry out fracking.</P><P>Also of note are three sites near Sheffield, licenced to <mark>Ineos</mark> Shale, a UK-based subsidiary of Anglo-Swiss chemical giant <mark>Ineos</mark>, which aims to drill test wells to assess the suitability of the sites for extracting shale gas. In <A href=""https://www.ft.com/content/352de042-7607-11e7-a3e8-60495fe6ca71?mhq5j=e4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">July</A>, <mark>Ineos</mark> Shale won a broad pre-emptive injunction that will put protesters in contempt of court if they obstruct its shale operations.</P><P>Meanwhile, <A href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-40482418"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">last month</A> Third Energy submitted its final plans to start fracking for shale gas at its Kirby Misperton site in North Yorkshire. It was granted planning permission for the site in May 2016.</P><P>This plan still needs to undergo a technical assessment from the <A href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Environment Agency</A> and requires approval from the government’s <A href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/oil-and-gas-authority"">Oil and Gas Authority (OGA)</A>. A spokesman for Third Energy tells <mark>Carbon</mark> Brief it hopes to begin fracking this year.</P><H4>How much shale gas does the UK have?</H4><P>The British Geological Survey (BGS) says the UK has large amounts of shale hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s below its surface. However, the precise distribution is not yet well known and there remains significant uncertainty over how much is extractable.</P><P>The BGS has <A href=""http://www.bgs.ac.uk/shalegas/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">examined</A> how much shale resources there are in several areas of the UK (see video below). Its central estimates for these are:</P><UL><LI>Over 1,300 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of shale gas in the <A href=""https://www.ogauthority.co.uk/media/2782/bgs_decc_bowlandshalegasreport_main_report.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Bowland-Hodder</A> shale in Lancashire;</LI><LI>Around 4.4 billion barrels (bbl) of shale oil in the <A href=""http://www.bgs.ac.uk/research/energy/shaleGas/wealdShaleOil.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Weald basin</A> in Sussex, but no significant gas resource;</LI><LI>A further 1.1bbl of shale oil in part of the <A href=""https://www.ogauthority.co.uk/exploration-production/onshore/reports-bgs-wessex-area-extension-to-weald-basin-shale/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Wessex</A> basin, near the Weald basin and;</LI><LI>Some 80tcf of shale gas and 6bbl of shale oil in the <A href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/360471/BGS_DECC_MVS_2014_MAIN_REPORT.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Midland Valley of Scotland</A>.</LI></UL><P>Two things are worth emphasising here. First, these are central, fairly rough estimates. The BGS’s range for the Bowland-Hodder shale, for example, is a lower limit of 822tcf and upper limit of 2281tcf.</P><P>Most importantly, though, these are calculations of the total resources of shale. Only a fraction of this will be commercially extractable reserves, depending on the cost of UK operations and the international market price of gas.</P><P>The BGS <A href=""https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmenergy/writev/isg/m17.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">says</A> it is too early to know what proportion of UK shale resources are recoverable, although it says US recovery factors are typically around 10%. Note that shale firms <A href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/10/06/a-long-way-still-to-go-for-britains-shale-gas-revolution/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">often argue</A> they need to begin drilling before they can understand how much of the UK’s shale gas is extractable.</P><P>The UK uses around <A href=""https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmwelaf/284/28405.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">3tcf of gas</A> each year. Assuming a 10% recovery rate and the BGS’s central estimates, the UK has 138tcf, or around 46 years worth of technically extractable shale gas.</P><P>It’s worth noting a 2013 assessment by the US <A href=""https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/worldshalegas/pdf/UK_2013.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Energy Information Administration</A> (EIA) estimated a far lower technically recoverable resource in the UK of 26tcf, equivalent to nine years of current UK gas use.</P><P>A <A href=""https://itportal.ogauthority.co.uk/web_files/promote/2015/regional_reports/Promote_UK_Shalegas_2015.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">2010 BGS estimate</A> for the Department of Energy and <mark>Climate Change</mark> (DECC) put the “total recoverable reserve potential” in the UK even lower, at just 5.3tcf. This is less than two years of use.</P><P><A href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261916301477#t0005"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Research</A> by UK-based commercial oil and gas consultancy the<A href=""https://www.energy-contract.com/""> Energy Contract Company (ECC)</A>, published in 2012, put technically recoverable shale gas far higher than this, at 40tcf, around 13 years worth.</P><P>Meanwhile, in 2013 the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST) <A href=""http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/ShaleGas_POSTbox.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">estimated</A> a potentially recoverable resource of 64-459tcf in the Bowland shale formation alone. This figure is based on a range of recovery rates of 8-20%.</P><P>There are currently no official <A href=""https://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/ShaleGas_POSTbox.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">reserve estimates</A>. As <A href=""http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/ShaleGas_POSTbox.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">POST</A> observes, UK reserves could be anywhere from “zero” to “substantial”.

These are the main areas that could be used to produce shale oil or gas in the UK, according to the BGS.

This was the most recent offer of onshore oil and gas licences and only the second to explicitly include shale resources.</LI><LI><B>Total area made available for licence in 2014 </B>All areas opened for bidding in the 14th licensing round. This covers approximately two fifths of the UK.</LI></UL><P>It’s worth emphasising that some of the licences shown in the map above are for firms that intended to explore for conventional oil or gas, rather than shale gas. Edward Hough, a geologist from the BGS, tells <mark>Carbon</mark> Brief:</P><P class=""quote"">“Operators may explore for shale gas and also a conventional source of hydro<mark>carbon</mark> under the same license. In some parts of the country, shale targets may underlie conventional hydro<mark>carbon</mark> reservoirs; as such, it’s not possible to put a figure on how many licenses are for shale versus conventional oil and gas.”</P><P>In addition, companies holding licences still need to go through planning applications to gain consent for drilling, with only a couple of companies currently at this stage in just a few locations (see first map above).</P><H4>Does the UK need shale gas?</H4><P>While it’s important to consider how much of the UK’s shale gas is recoverable, perhaps the more pertinent questions are how soon it could start to flow and if it is needed.</P><P>This is crucial to the question of whether shale gas production can be ready in time to replace the UK’s <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/analysis-uk-cuts-<mark>carbon</mark>-record-coal-drop"">rapidly falling</A> coal use, the main way it could substantively cut UK greenhouse gas emissions (see below).</P><P>According to National Grid’s most recent <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/factcheck-how-much-power-will-uk-electric-vehicles-need"">Future Energy Scenarios</A>, UK gas production fell to 35 billion cubic metres (bcm; 1.2tcf) in 2016, a third of its level in 2000. This fall has been offset by a <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/six-charts-show-uk-progress-on-low-<mark>carbon</mark>-energy-slowing-down"">20% fall in demand</A>, with imports making up the difference. Similarly large falls in conventional UK gas production are expected over the next 30 years, National Grid says.</P><P>This fall in production could be offset by cutting demand further, by importing more gas, by producing domestic shale gas or a combination of all three.</P><P>To explore these options, National Grid lays out four scenarios, with shale gas included in the two with reduced <mark>climate</mark> ambition. It’s worth highlighting that these scenarios are not forecasts of what is most likely to happen, but rather potential paths, which can also serve as warnings. Only one of the scenarios meets the UK’s legally-binding <mark>carbon</mark> targets.</P><P>Its “consumer power” scenario has high gas demand and a focus on domestically produced supplies. Shale production begins around 2020, ramping up to 32bcm (1.1tcf) per year from 2031. Total annual gas use in 2050 sits at 70bcm (2.5 tcf), only 20% lower than in 2016.</P><DIV id=""attachment_27352"" style=""width: 1034px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Annual UK gas supply by source (billions of cubic metres, left axis) and the share of supplies that are imported (percent, right axis) in the Consumer Power scenario.

This might be possible as long as <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/explained-fugitive-methane-emissions-from-natural-gas-production"">fugitive methane</A> emissions remain below a certain level, often calculated at around 3%.</P><P>In practice, however, the UK is unlikely to be able to replace coal with domestic shale gas, given coal is being phased out of the power sector by 2025 and is <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/analysis-dramatic-shift-uk-government-outlook-gas-clean-energy"">expected</A> to fall to very low levels well before then.</P><P>This leaves the small potential emissions advantage of domestic shale gas over imported LNG.</P><P>The CCC says that onshore oil and gas extraction, including fracking, is <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/ccc-fracking-industry-must-meet-tough-conditions-achieve-<mark>climate</mark>-goals"">incompatible</A> with the UK’s <mark>climate</mark> targets unless it can meet tough standards on emissions. It laid out three key tests for a UK shale gas industry. These are:</P><UL><LI><B>Strict limits on emissions</B>. This means limiting methane leakage during development, production and well decommissioning, as well as prohibiting production that would entail significant <mark>CO2</mark> emissions from changes in land use. The CCC says current regulations fall short of these requirements.</LI><LI><B>Gas consumption in line with <mark>carbon</mark> budgets.</B> This means cutting gas consumption at least in half by 2050 and using shale gas to replace, rather than add to, current gas imports. If <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage (CCS) is not available, UK gas consumption needs to drop to around 80% below today’s levels by 2050.  A separate report, released last year by the industry-funded <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/<mark>carbon</mark>-capture-essential-for-<mark>climate</mark>-friendly-fracking-in-uk-says-industry-backed-report"">Task Force on Shale Gas</A>, concluded that CCS will be “essential” if fracking develops at scale.</LI><LI><B>Shale industry emissions offset by more cuts elsewhere.</B> This means the unavoidable emissions from a UK shale gas industry would have to be matched by cuts in other areas of the economy.  Offsetting these emissions through other sectors would be possible, but potentially difficult, the CCC said.</LI></UL><P>The CCC reiterated this advice in its latest annual <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/ccc-plan-to-fill-uk-<mark>climate</mark>-policy-gap-urgently-needed"">progress report</A>, published in June. It also said the government should implement new policies to more tightly regulate and monitor shale gas wells, in order to ensure rapid action to address <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/explained-fugitive-methane-emissions-from-natural-gas-production"">methane leaks</A>.</P><P>Meanwhile, the <A href=""http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weowebsite/2011/WEO2011_GoldenAgeofGasReport.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">International Energy Agency</A> said in 2011 that the significant global development of shale gas could put the world on a trajectory towards a long-term temperature rise of over 3.5C, far above the Paris Agreement <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/explainer-the-long-term-goal-of-the-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal"">limit</A> of “well below 2C”.</P><H4>Could shale gas be low <mark>carbon</mark>?</H4><P>Some shale gas proponents have <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/the-<mark>carbon</mark>-brief-interview-averil-macdonald"">argued</A> it could be used to produce low-<mark>carbon</mark> hydrogen via a <A href=""https://energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-natural-gas-reforming"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">steam reformation process</A>, combined with CCS. The hydrogen would replace methane in the gas grid and be used for heating or fuel cells.</P><P>Depending on how tightly emissions are controlled during shale gas production, however, this might only <A href=""https://heatpolicy.wordpress.com/2016/07/15/is-hydrogen-at-hype-cycle-peak/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">cut emissions</A> by 59% compared to fossil gas.

The manifesto also said it “could play a crucial role in rebalancing our economy”.</P><P>The weakened Conservative administration has abandoned a string of manifesto policies since losing its majority at the general election. Last month, energy minister Richard Harrington reiterated the government’s stance on shale gas, but did not mention emissions, <A href=""http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2017-07-17/5116/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">saying</A>:</P><P class=""quote"">“Shale gas could have great potential to be a domestic energy resource that makes us less reliant on imports and opens up a wealth of job opportunities.

The sale will not affect BP’s existing rights to capacity in FPS. Under the terms of the agreement <mark>INEOS</mark> will pay BP a consideration of up to $250 million for the business, comprising a cash payment of $125 million on completion and an earn-out arrangement over seven years that totals up to $125 million.  </P><P>BP group chief executive Bob Dudley commented: “BP is returning to growth in the North Sea as we bring important new projects, including the Quad 204 redevelopment and Clair Ridge, into production and increase new exploration. While the Forties pipeline had great significance in BP’s history, our business here is now centred around our major offshore interests west of Shetland and in the Central North Sea. </P><P>“The pipeline has long been an important feedstock supplier to <mark>INEOS</mark> at Grangemouth. We believe that through also owning FPS, <mark>INEOS</mark> will be able to realise greater integration benefits and help secure a competitive long-term future for this important piece of UK oil and gas infrastructure.”</P><P>Built, owned and operated by BP, the Forties pipeline was opened in 1975 to transport oil from the Forties field, the UK’s first major offshore oil field. Today FPS carries liquids production from some 85 fields in the Central and Northern North Sea and several Norwegian fields on behalf of around 40 companies. The system has a capacity of 575,000 barrels of oil a day. BP sold its interests in the Forties field to Apache in 2003 and sold the Grangemouth refinery and chemical plants to <mark>INEOS</mark> in 2005.</P><P><mark>INEOS</mark> chairman and chief executive officer Jim Ratcliffe commented: “The North Sea continues to present new opportunities for <mark>INEOS</mark>. The Forties Pipeline System is a UK strategic asset and was originally designed to work together to feed the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical facilities. We have a strong track record of acquiring non-core assets improving their efficiency and reliability, securing long term employment and investment. I am delighted that we can now bring this integrated system back under single ownership in <mark>INEOS</mark>.”</P><P>Mark Thomas, BP North Sea Regional President said: “This allows us to further focus our North Sea business around our core offshore assets - bringing new fields into production, redeveloping and renewing existing producing facilities and acquiring and exploring new acreage and interests through licence rounds and farm-ins. </P><P>“As with our recent agreement with EnQuest, we believe this is a good example of having the ‘right assets’ in the ‘right hands’, offering new opportunities for the assets and benefitting the UKCS, in the spirit of the government’s aim of maximising economic recovery of the UK’s oil and gas resources.” </P><P>FPS is expected to transition to <mark>INEOS</mark> as a fully operational entity with those staff who operate and support the various elements of the business expected to transfer with the business. Their contractual terms and conditions are protected under UK Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations (TUPE). </P><P>Around 300 BP staff are currently associated with operating and supporting the FPS business at Kinneil, Falkirk, Dalmeny, Aberdeen and offshore. BP will now begin consultation with in-scope staff for both the unionised and non-unionised populations.</P><P>Subject to the receipt of regulatory and other third party approvals, BP aims to complete the sale and transfer of operatorship during 2017.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV data-component-name=""richtext"" data-component-container=""true"" class=""nv-richtext-component nv-component section""><DIV class=""nv-richtext""><H3>Notes to editors</H3><UL><LI>The FPS system primarily comprises a 169 kilometre (105 mile), 36” pipeline from the unmanned offshore Forties Unity platform to the onshore terminal at Cruden Bay.

There were only 39 final reports filed at that time. This limits our data, as final reports replace the initial reports on the TCEQ website after being filed (out of 143 final reports). Thus, 39 <EM>initial</EM> reports filed by 26 distinct facilities are missing from our collection.</P><P>For comparison sake, we included the ability to swap between data from initial and final estimates of <mark>pollution</mark> reported to TCEQ. Users can see which companies initially underestimated their air <mark>pollution</mark>, and which companies over-estimated the extent of <mark>pollution</mark>.</P><P>We included every incident reported to TCEQ Regions 10 (Beaumont), 12 (Houston) and 14 (Corpus Christi) from August 23, 2017, when many refineries began to shut down, to September 25, 2017, a month after Harvey made landfall. We also included data from other <A href=""https://www.tceq.texas.gov/assets/public/gis/images/regions.gif"">TCEQ regions</A> when reports clearly indicated that the <mark>pollution</mark> was a consequence of hurricane Harvey.</P><P>As of October 24, 2017, not all final reports have been published. 20 final reports remain un-filed. Many of these reports are “opacity events,” an industry term for smoke <mark>pollution</mark> at facilities, which are not measured in pounds and will not affect current totals.</P><P>We merged a few groups of chemicals for the sake of simplifying some of the data that is displayed. We consolidated various types of butanes, butenes, pentanes, pentenes, and xylenes, which were (infrequently) reported by companies with specific isomers or variations. We merged “xylene, mixed isomers” and “xylene-n” into “xylenes,” as an example. We also combined nitrogen oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to display as “Nitrogen Oxides (NOx),” as both chemicals have <A href=""https://www3.epa.gov/ttncatc1/dir1/fnoxdoc.pdf"">similar effects</A> in terms of acid rain, smog formation, and human health. All other chemicals are listed exactly as companies reported them.

These will start in the Yorkshire Wolds (south of Malton) and then be followed by the southern edge of the North York Moors Local Plan. Details will be published in the local Press nearer the time and we will aim to publish them on this webpage.</P><P>The NPA welcomes the Government’s intention to prohibit any surface development required for hydraulic fracturing within National Parks as this increases the protection afforded to these special areas (DECC Consultation 4 Nov 2015). However, the Regulations voted on today (16 December 2015) which allow fracking to occur below 1200m from drilling outside the boundary of a National Park undermine this intention and indeed the legislation protecting these areas, which do not stop at a certain depth below the surface.</P><P>The Authority understands the Government’s wish to proceed with the shale gas industry as a transitional approach to help to move towards a lower <mark>carbon</mark> energy strategy whilst also demonstrating to the public that the country’s most sensitive environments would be protected from the risks associated with fracking. However, the fact that fracking itself will still be able to take place in the geology of the National Park means that public concerns surrounding potential groundwater contamination, seismic activity and faulting and the use of chemicals and release of naturally occurring radiative material do not appear to be addressed.</P><P>In cases where there may be future proposals for lateral fracking to extract shale gas beneath the North York Moors, the Authority would assess such a planning application against the government policy known as the ‘Major Development Test’. This does not allow such development in National Parks unless there are exceptional circumstances which must demonstrate that there is a national need for the development and that it can’t take place outside the designated area. As the Minerals Planning Authority the NPA therefore has strong planning powers to assess whether to allow future proposals for lateral fracking.</P><P>Jim Bailey, Chair of National Parks England said: </P><P>“Today’s decision to protect National Parks from surface works is welcome; and we think it is now essential that the Government’s National Planning Policy Framework is amended to make it crystal clear that hydraulic fracturing is not allowed in National Parks.  The public want to see the highest level of protection for National Parks, and so works located close by but that might involve drilling underneath National Parks must be subject to the most rigorous testing.  These sensitive areas should be the last, not the first place that developers should prospect.”</P><P>The following information on fracking is provided in response to growing public interest on the subject in and around the National Park. The North York Moors National Park Authority is the minerals planning authority for the National Park and will be responsible for determining any planning applications for fracking.</P><H3>What is fracking?</H3><P>Fracking is the common term for hydraulic fracturing, a process which involves high pressure injection of water, sand and chemicals through a borehole into deep shale rock causing this to crack and release gases (mostly methane). A vertical borehole is required to inject the sand, water and chemicals to significant depths below the surface where the fracking would take place. The gas which is extracted flows back through the borehole to the surface where it could either be used to generate electricity or be fed into gas supply networks. Waste water also returns to the surface through the borehole and this would need to be treated. Further details on the fracking process can be found <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/268017/About_shale_gas_and_hydraulic_fracturing_Dec_2013.pdf"">here</A>.</P><DIV><H3>Is fracking currently taking place in the North York Moors National Park?</H3><P>No. To date there has not been any commercial interest in fracking within the North York Moors National Park. Conventional forms of gas exploration and production have taken place in and around the National Park over recent decades, particularly in the south west of the Park and around Westerdale.</P></DIV><DIV><H3>Is there shale gas under the North York Moors National Park?</H3><P>A report produced by <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/226874/BGS_DECC_BowlandShaleGasReport_MAIN_REPORT.pdf"">British Geological Survey</A> suggests that the geology beneath the southern part of the North York Moors National Park may contain commercially viable shale gas resources. The British Geological Survey report suggests that shale rock which may be suitable for fracking is likely to exist between 1,500 and 4,000 metres below the surface of the National Park.</P><H3>What is the National Park Authority’s current policy on fracking?</H3><P>Whilst the Authority does not currently have any planning policies relating specifically to gas or fracking, a number of the policies contained in the <A href=""http://www.northyorkmoors.org.uk/planning/framework"">Core Strategy and Development Policies</A> would be relevant to determining applications for fracking. Within the National Park particular consideration would be given to the impacts on the Park’s special qualities and fracking applications may also be subject to consideration under the Major Development Test whereby the presumption is for refusal except in exceptional circumstances and where the development can be demonstrated to be in the public interest.</P><P>The Authority is developing policies to assess proposals for gas extraction, including fracking, as part of the Minerals and Waste Joint Plan which it is producing jointly with North Yorkshire County Council and the City of York Council. See <A href=""http://www.northyorks.gov.uk/mwjointplan"">North Yorkshire County Council's Minerals and Waste Joint Plan</A> for details. In the interim, the Authority has adopted former Government planning policy on oil and gas developments as a <A href=""http://www.northyorkmoors.org.uk/planning/planning-advice/Planning-Advice-Note-8-Oil-and-Gas.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Planning Advice Note</A>.  </P><P>The National Park Authority has recently issued a &quot;Positional Statement&quot; on fracking which you can see <A href=""http://www.northyorkmoors.org.uk/about-us/press-office/press-releases/articles2/positional-statement-on-fracking-january-2019"">here</A>.</P></DIV><DIV><H3>Why hasn’t the National Park Authority banned fracking?</H3><P>Whilst the Authority can put planning policies in place which would enable the potential impacts of any proposed fracking developments to be rigorously assessed, banning fracking is unlikely to be legally acceptable. Before planning policies can be adopted they are subject to examination by a Government appointed Planning Inspector and are unlikely to be found ‘sound’ if not in accordance with Government policy.</P></DIV><H3>What is the Government’s policy on fracking?</H3><P>The Government’s current overall stance towards fracking is set out <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/government/policy-teams/office-of-unconventional-gas-and-oil-ougo"">here</A>. National planning policy is contained in the <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/6077/2116950.pdf"" target=""_blank"">National Planning Policy Framework</A>. Whilst this doesn’t contain specific reference to shale gas or fracking it does state that planning authorities should ‘address constraints on production and processing within areas that are licensed for oil and gas exploration or production’. Government policy in the National Planning Policy Framework relating to National Parks is equally relevant when considering any planning applications for fracking in the National Park. </P><DIV><H3>What chemicals would be used?</H3><P>The proportion of chemicals making up the water / sand / chemical mix is 0.2% at the UK’s only current fracking site in Lancashire, however the potential for effects to arise from the use of chemicals would depend upon the chemicals used and the possibility of these entering water bodies. Details of the actual chemicals approved for use at the site in Lancashire are contained in the document <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/268017/About_shale_gas_and_hydraulic_fracturing_Dec_2013.pdf"" target=""_blank"">About Shale Gas and Hydraulic Fracturing</A>. Consent from the Environment Agency would be required prior to the use of any chemicals. </P></DIV><DIV><H3>What would happen to waste water?</H3><P>Water which has been used in the fracking process is returned to the surface and may contain minerals dissolved from the shale including naturally occurring radioactive minerals. This water, known as flow-back fluid, would require treatment which could be undertaken by either having a treatment plant on site, transportation to an off-site treatment plant or by disposal to the foul sewer. Treatment at an off-site plant may involve transportation by lorry or by pipe, the effects of which would need to be assessed as part of any planning application.</P></DIV><DIV><H3>What surface development is required?</H3><P>Visible structures at the surface of the site in Lancashire where fracking is currently taking place include a drilling rig (around 30m high), an area of hardstanding and numerous pieces of ancillary equipment, as shown on the photographs on the operator’s <A href=""http://www.cuadrillaresources.com"">website</A>. The surface development requirements may, however, vary from site to site and the planning authority is able to impose conditions relating to landscaping and screening the site.</P></DIV><DIV><H3>What permits and consents are required before fracking can take place and how is fracking monitored?</H3><P>The process of fracking, including the exploration and appraisal phases, are tightly controlled and subject to a number of regulatory regimes. Four regulatory bodies are involved in issuing consents and licenses for fracking. </P><P>The Department of Energy and <mark>Climate Change</mark> issues Petroleum Exploration and Development Licenses which give the holder exclusive rights to oil and gas exploration within a given area. This license does not give consent for drilling or any other development associated with gas exploration or production, which need to be subject to the regimes set out below. Further details on the licensing process are available on the <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/oil-and-gas-petroleum-licensing-guidance"">DECC website</A>.  </P><P>Planning permission from the Minerals Planning Authority is required at the exploration, appraisal and production phases of gas extraction. The Minerals Planning Authority for the National Park is the North York Moors National Park Authority. Applications for planning permission will be considered against the relevant planning policies and will include consideration of a range of effects such as visual impact, effects on the natural environment, effects on local amenity and vehicle movements. Applications for planning permission would need to be accompanied by an Environmental Impact Assessment. As part of the planning application process there would be an opportunity for members of the public to comment on the application.</P><P>The Environment Agency is responsible for issuing and monitoring permits related to water use, protecting water quality, the use of chemicals and the management of waste water. A permit will not be issued if it is considered that the activity would pose an unacceptable risk to the environment. The Environment Agency would also be consulted on any planning applications for fracking. More details about the Environment Agency’s role are available <A href=""http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/133885.aspx"">here</A>. </P><P>The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for regulating and monitoring the safety of the well and the site. Further details of the Health and Safety Executive’s role can be found <A href=""http://www.hse.gov.uk/offshore/unconventional-gas.htm"">here</A>. </P><P>Prior to drilling beginning, the Department of Energy and <mark>Climate Change</mark> must provide consent to drill. As part of this process, a Hydraulic Fracturing Programme must be prepared which will set out ways in which any seismic activity will be monitored and acted upon where necessary. This would be based on the Government’s <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/270676/DECC_infographic_Traffic-light-system_finaldec13.pdf"" target=""_blank"">‘traffic light’ system</A>. </P><P>Further details of the licensing and permitting requirements are available <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265988/Onshore_UK_oil_and_gas_exploration_England_Dec13_contents.pdf"" target=""_blank"">here</A>. </P></DIV><H3>If an area has a Government license for gas exploration and development does this mean that fracking can take place?</H3><DIV><P>No. The Government periodically issues Petroleum Exploration and Development Licenses in geographical blocks, but planning permission and other permits must also be obtained prior to any activity taking place. The areas currently licensed are shown <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/15095/landfields-lics.pdf"" target=""_blank"">here</A>. Licenses have been awarded in the southern part of the National Park and around Westerdale. A further round of licensing is anticipated to take place in 2015.</P><H3>If permission is granted for exploration does this mean that production can also take place?</H3></DIV><DIV><P>No. There are three distinct phases of gas development – exploration, appraisal and production. To determine whether production is likely to be commercially viable in any particular location, operators would need to obtain planning permission to carry out exploration to investigate details of the geology and the likely amounts of gas available. Planning permission and any other consents granted will relate specifically to the phase in question and do not mean that permission for production will subsequently be granted. The fracking process may be involved at any of these stages.</P><H3>How is a gas injection well distinct from fracking?</H3><P>Given the public interest in proposal <A href=""http://planning.northyorkmoors.org.uk/Northgate/Online/DMS/DocumentViewer.aspx?SearchType=Planning%20Application&amp;PK=810934"" target=""_blank"">NYM/2014/0587/EIA</A> (Natural gas production and water re-injection at the existing borehole at Ebberston Moor South Well Site, the drilling of a second borehole for water production and re-injection etc.), a planning application for conventional gas extraction, the following information outlines the differences. </P><P>Conventional gas extraction does not involve high pressure fracturing of the bed rock to enable shale gas to escape but is targeting gas at a shallower level. Normally, gas is under pressure and comes to the surface once it is drilled – the difference with this application is that water associated with the gas needs to be pumped out to enable the gas to then escape. That water then needs to be disposed of – which could be either through piping or tankering it away – however, in this instance the intention is to re-inject it back into a different geological layer.  Public concerns are around whether the water being pumped back under a certain level of pressure would trigger any seismic activity and whether the water could seep into other geological layers and contaminate potable water aquifers, which are essentially the source of drinking water for nearby towns. Both of these risks are extremely low – and the Coralline  Limestone water aquifer is many hundreds of metres above the layer receiving the injected water. It is also important to note that the water being re-injected has not been added to and unlike fracking fluid contains no chemicals or other pollutants – it is merely highly salty – many times more so than sea water.</P><P><STRONG>The proposal is for conventional gas extraction on a small scale</STRONG>, which will contribute a minor but useful contribution to the nation’s energy supply needs. This helps to bridge the challenge of moving towards a lower <mark>carbon</mark> economy which, to be successful, has to be managed in a phased way as coal fired power stations are eventually replaced by a combination of lower <mark>carbon</mark> and renewable energy sources. The North York Moors has a history of small scale conventional gas extraction which, until the national debate over fracking, raised no environmental or landscape concerns from residents or the wider public.</P><P><STRONG>The proposal is not a new development</STRONG>. It is not a completely new scheme, but a combination of two halves of schemes which have already been approved.  It represents joint working and cooperation by two gas exploration companies and therefore reduces the infrastructure requirements involved. Approval of this application means that gas from the Ebberston Moor field extracted by both companies will be piped to Knapton generating station, safeguarding local jobs and negating the need to construct a large gas processing plant at Thornton le Dale which was approved on appeal and which would have impacted adversely on local residents and the National Park.</P><P><STRONG>Environmental risks are negligible.</STRONG> Any risks involved in re-injecting produced water from the well site back into the geology in terms of water <mark>pollution</mark> or induced seismic activity have been fully assessed as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) with the application and this has been independently reviewed by consultants commissioned by the National Park Authority. There is nothing added to the ground water extracted, it is simply pumped back in its natural state into a different geological horizon under low pressure to allow the gas to be extracted.  The conclusions of the technical consultants are that such environmental impacts are negligible and “not significant&quot; in EIA terms.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

A hairline crack was discovered last week, which forced <mark>Ineos</mark> to reduce pressure in the pipeline. But the company announced Monday that it would carry out a controlled shut down after it appeared the crack had widened.</P><P>“It is a supply concern not only because the pipeline transports a significant portion of North Sea crude oil output, but also because it may take weeks before the issue is resolved,” Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics, told <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-gains-on-forties-pipeline-shutdown-new-york-blast-idUSKBN1E501P"">Reuters</A>.</P><P>A shutdown for that length of time and of that magnitude of capacity would be a problem for any pipeline system, but a closure of this particular pipeline has global implications.</P><P>The Forties system is the main carrier of the oil that underpins the Brent crude oil benchmark, a fact reflected in the nearly 2 percent spike in Brent prices on Monday, rising above $64.50 per barrel and breaking a new two-year high.</P><P>The outage could disrupt North Sea oil supply – North Sea operators could be forced to throttle back production because of the bottleneck. According to <A href=""https://www.ft.com/content/6dfed9fb-b855-37b8-a30a-a5b6016e8523"">the FT</A>, the Forties system carries nearly 40 percent of the UK’s North Sea oil production, and it connects 85 offshore oil fields to the mainland. The BBC <A href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-42308437"">reported</A> that more than 80 oil platforms would need to shut down because of the disruption at the Forties system. <SPAN style=""color: #800000;""><STRONG class=""related""><A href=""https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OilCoin-Worlds-First-Compliant-Cryptocurrency.html"">Related: OilCoin: The World’s First Compliant Cryptocurrency</A></STRONG></SPAN></P><P>As of Monday, some reports of announced shut downs <A href=""https://twitter.com/OilSheppard/status/940284844126466048"">started to trickle in</A>.</P><P>The outage has echoes of the spill at the <A href=""https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/WTI-Prices-Surge-On-Keystone-Spill.html"">Keystone pipeline</A> from just a few weeks ago, a crucial artery that carries nearly 600,000 bpd from Canada to the U.S. The shutdown of the pipeline caused WTI prices to surge and pushed WTI futures into a state of backwardation, in which near-term prices trade at a premium to longer-dated futures. It was the first time in three years that the WTI futures curve was downward sloping, which is a sign of tightness in the market.</P><P>But the ramifications for the outage at the Forties could be even more significant, given the much greater influence of the Brent benchmark on global prices. Assuming the 450,000-bpd pipeline remains shut for three weeks, a rough calculation would mean that up to 10 million barrels could be disrupted. That is important because OECD crude inventories stood only 140 million barrels above the five-year average, according to the latest data from the IEA for September.</P><P>The UK will need to purchase crude from elsewhere to make up for the shortfall. That could tighten the oil market in the Atlantic Basin, an area that already was feeling more pressure as the global market continued towards rebalancing. The market for Brent will be pretty jittery for the next few weeks, and an unexpected outage from Nigeria, for example, could really send things through the roof.</P><P>The outage will also widen the Brent-WTI disparity again, which had narrowed a bit after several weeks of hovering at multi-year highs. As of midday trading on Monday, Brent jumped to a nearly $7-per-barrel premium over WTI, a differential that is up nearly $1/barrel from last week. <SPAN style=""color: #800000;""><STRONG class=""related""><A href=""https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/International/Will-Libya-Be-First-To-Ditch-The-OPEC-Production-Deal.html"">Related: Will Libya Be First To Ditch The OPEC Production Deal?</A></STRONG></SPAN></P><P> </P><P>(Click to enlarge)</P><P>A wider price disparity, in turn, will lead to even sharper demand for U.S. crude, which becomes more attractive to buyers as Brent gets more expensive. As a knock-on effect from the outage of the Forties system, the U.S. could see higher oil exports in the next few weeks, which will help drain inventories at a faster clip.</P><P>In short, the crack in the Forties pipeline will have ripple effects throughout the oil market, and it will be felt across the globe until it is repaired.</P><P>By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.com</P><P><STRONG>More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:</STRONG></P></DIV></PICTURE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

I am currently collaborating with a range of expert from different disciplines in order to understand the links between patterns and processes in natural systems, and to develop a conceptual framework within which to advance ecological theory. I am particularly interested in how &quot;metabolic theory&quot; can be applied to complex ecological systems. Body size and temperature determine basal metabolic rate, and the consequences of this are manifested across multiple levels of biological organisation, from molecules, to individuals, to entire ecosystems. Allometric scaling relationships are common in nature (e.g. body size versus ingestion rate, growth rate, interaction strength etc.) and can have potentially profound effects on the structure and dynamics of complex ecological networks (food webs, plant-pollinator networks etc.) and their ability to withstand perturbations.</P><P>In parallel with this ongoing work I am also developing new individual-based approaches to ecological networks. Most food webs published to date ignore the fact that trophic interactions occur between individuals, even though this is the level at which feeding links are realised.  An individual-based perspective can reveal surprising differences from the traditional viewpoint. Ultimately, one of my aims of my research is to use it to address more applied issues: in particular, I am interested in how food webs and ecosystems respond to stressors - especially <mark>climate change</mark>. If we can understand the underlying mechanisms then we are in a better position to be able to conserve, or even restore, damaged ecosystems.  Much of my current research is now directed towards studying geothermally-heated streams in Iceland, to study the impacts of global warming on natural systems.  </P><DIV class=""video-player"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvEJGOyHMQ""><FIGURE class=""caption""><FIGCAPTION>Research Focus - Dr. Guy Woodward</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><H2>Research Group and Grant Awards</H2><P>Since 2005 I have been awarded &gt;£7M of external grant funding as a Principal or Co-Investigator.  n 2012 I was awarded £3.7m, including £430k as PI on part of a larger consortium (£3m) NERC grant led by Isabelle Durance at Cardiff University and £700k on a NERC Standard Grant led by Dr Mark Ledger. <SPAN>I wa</SPAN>s awarded £511k in 2011 as PI for another NERC Standard grant (&quot;Using individual metabolism and body size to predict <mark>climate</mark> warming impacts on aquatic food webs&quot;; Woodward, Reuman, Petchey &amp; Reiss).  In 2010 I was awarded &gt;£1m as a Co-Investigatior on two NERC Standard grants (PIs: Jon Grey &amp; Mark Trimmer). I was previously the Principal Investigator on a NERC Grant (£372k) &quot;Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in fresh waters: a food web perspective&quot; (2006-2009).  I co-wrote another NERC Grant as the named PDRA (£338k [2005-2008]) investigating how the introduction of a top predator alters the structure and functioning of a stream food web and was awarded a further two years of funding (£575k [2008-2010) as Co-I under the NERC EHFI scheme to carry out an additional bottom-up manipulation of the same food web.

6.  The Briefs</P><P><STRONG><U>1.  Oil and the Global Economy</U></STRONG></P><P>Oil prices fell again last week on concerns that the OPEC production cut will not be enough to offset increasing US shale oil production. The reopening of two Libyan oilfields which could bring Libyan production back to the vicinity of 700,000 b/d added to the pressure on oil prices. At week’s close, New York futures were below $50 a barrel with London a couple of dollars higher, both down about 8 percent from their April peak of $54-$55 a barrel.</P><P>Moscow says it now has cut production by the pledged 300,000 b/d. However, this cut was from an artificially high base and does not mean very much. Given that the Saudis have cut more than their required share, the 1.8 million b/d OPEC/NOPEC cut seems to be complete for now. Given the increases in oil production elsewhere in the last six months, there seems to be general agreement that the production cut will need to be extended until the end of the year.  Otherwise it will be a failure and oil prices will continue to fall. Some observers are saying that the production cut will need to be continued at least through the first half of 2018. For now, however, it seems that only a six-month extension will be agreed upon at a meeting later this month.</P><P>A few analysts are saying that US shale oil production is likely to increase at a faster pace than the EIA has been estimating. Rystad Energy expects US shale oil output to grow by 100,000 b/d each month for the rest of this year and into 2018 if prices hold around $50-$55 a barrel.  This is considerably higher than the EIA projections that US production will grow by about 29,000 b/d each month in 2017 and 57,000 b/d in 2018.  Should Rystad be closer to the mark, it would wipe out much of the OPEC/NOPEC production cut, forcing prices lower.  Lower prices, of course, would reduce the incentive for US shale oil producers to increase production at the levels Rystad is projecting.  The US oil rig count rose for the 15<SUP>th</SUP> straight time last week to 870 rigs or 450 more than at this time last year. The shale oil industry still has a lot of rigs in storage, so it seems likely that the US rig count will continue to increase for a while.</P><P>Looking beyond the current concerns about OPEC vs. US shale oil production is the question of what the world’s oil supply will look like in the next decade. Since US shale oil production took off seven or eight years ago, the possibility of an imminent supply crunch or even peak global oil production has been dismissed by most observers.  However, worries about supply shortages due to the large decrease in oil industry capital expenditures again are being voiced by responsible observers. Last week we heard from Saudi Aramco and the International Energy Agency, both of which have voiced similar warnings in the past.  The IEA points out that worldwide only 2.4 billion barrels of new oil reserves were discovered last year and that the number of oil production projects receiving a final investment decision in 2016 was at the lowest since the 1940’s.</P><P>For now, major US oil companies are looking at investing more heavily in shale oil where wells cost less than $10 million to drill and frack as opposed to the billions of dollars that large offshore platforms cost. A few outside observers of the shale oil industry are saying that large production increases cannot continue for much more than a few years. The days of spectacular production increases from the Bakken and Eagle Ford shale oil formations seem to be ending; however, the Permian Basin may still have a way to go. US shale gas production in the Marcellus shal seems to be slipping already, undercutting optimism that US shale gas will be powering the world in coming years.</P><P>Global demand for oil is still on the order of 34 billion barrels per year and is likely to keep increasing by 400-500 million barrels each year.  While the subject of derision by many optimists, some form of peak oil still looks likely in the next decade from a combination of lower supplies, higher prices, concerns about <mark>climate change</mark>, or even new technologies.</P><P><STRONG><U>2.  The Middle East &amp; North Africa</U></STRONG></P><P><STRONG><U>Iran</U></STRONG>:  Tehran says it is willing to cap its oil production until the end of the year to help the Saudis raise oil production. Oil Minister Zanganeh said last week that Iran had kept its production at 3.8 million b/d under the agreement that allowed the country to limit its production rather than make an actual cut.</P><P>Six candidates have been approved by the Iran’s clerics to run in the May 19<SUP>th</SUP> presidential election.  While President Rouhani seems likely to win reelection, growing animosity with Washington and the continued deterioration of the Syrian situation makes the outlook for US-Iranian relations uncertain.</P><P><STRONG><U>Iraq</U></STRONG>: Efforts to comply with the production cut seems to have leveled off in March when the country’s crude production increased by 0.4 percent to 4.586 million b/d. The government claims to be fully complying with the OPEC/NOPEC production cut.  Baghdad says it too will go along with whatever consensus on the continuation of production cuts is reached at the next OPEC meeting on May 25<SUP>th</SUP>.</P><P>However, the country plans to increase its crude production by 600,000 b/d to 5 million b/d by the end of this year. Also, Iraq has started working on doubling the output of the Halfaya oil field to 400,000 b/d next year. The UKs Petrofrac has just be awarded a $70 million contract to expand Iraq’s port facilities in the Persian Gulf.  In December, the company received a $75 million contract to improve the export terminal at Basra. With big increases in production coming and the cost of producing Iraqi oil still well below world selling prices, Baghdad will be hard pressed to continue any production freeze into 2018 should that be necessary.</P><P><STRONG><U>Saudi Arabia</U></STRONG>: The value of Saudi Aramco is still a hot topic. The Saudi deputy crown prince Salman al Saud is still pushing the figure of $2 trillion as the company’s market value so that a five percent share should be worth about $100 billion.  The government has been adjusting tax policies lately so that the company would be able to pay a dividend after the IPO rather than just siphoning all the revenue into the national treasury. According to the <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM>, even Aramco insiders say that, even given the new tax policies, a valuation of the company at $1.3 to $1.5 trillion would be more realistic.  At one point, industry consultants Wood Mackenzie Ltd. were saying the company’s value was more like $400 billion.  The company likely will never release detailed production and reserve estimates that would give outside analysts a better chance of setting a proper value on the company.</P><P>Analysts are saying that the Saudis are losing market share to Iran and Iraq due to the production cut. The Saudis agreed to a cut of 486,000 b/d while the Iraqis said they would cut 210,000 b/d from a dubious base number. Iran was allowed to increase production by 90,000 b/d.  The Saudis continue to trash the various peak oil theories, both the supply, and the demand versions, and assert that the demand for oil will keep growing for decades.</P><P>The Saudis say they have foiled an attack launched from Yemen to blow up a Saudi oil production distribution center at Jazan on the Red Sea.</P><P><STRONG><U>Libya</U></STRONG>: The National Oil Company says it may have reached long-term agreements with local Petroleum Facilities Guard units to keep the Sharara oil field open and producing. There is much reason to be skeptical as in the past, such agreements have only lasted for a few weeks before somebody closes the taps and demands a bigger share of the pie. Libya produced 622,000 b/d in March, but production was way down in April due to the dispute. The company still says it hopes to be producing about 1.2 million b/d by the end of the year if disgruntled people will stop closing ports and pipelines they control. If Libya can reach its goal, its increased production will be a big problem for OPEC as the country is not under any obligation to keep its production under control.</P><P><STRONG><U>3.  China</U></STRONG></P><P>Newly released statistics show China’s economy is pulling back from the five-year high that was seen in the last two-quarters. A slipping Purchasing Manager’s Index suggests that manufacturing slipped in April. The new data showed a weakening in employment, output, new orders and export orders. In recent weeks, the government has been introducing tighter curbs on property investment and has been cutting back on infrastructure spending. Some economists are saying the growth in China’s GDP may slip to 6.6 percent this year from 6.7 percent last year.</P><P>The government announced that non-fossil fuel use would increase to 20 percent of energy consumption by 2030 and more than 50 percent by 2050. <mark>Carbon</mark> emissions are due to peak by 2030. This is all very nice, but many think we do not have another 35 years to fiddle with emissions before climatic conditions become so bad they will force change.</P><P><STRONG><U>4. Russia</U></STRONG></P><P>Some analysts are noting that it may be more difficult for Moscow to extend its 300,000 b/d production cutback into the second half. It is now clear that Moscow surged its output in the months before the cuts started so that their cut could be based on a higher than normal output and would not have as much impact. Traditionally Russian production slows during the harsh winter months and picks up again in the second half. A close look might reveal that Moscow did not cut any oil production that would not have occurred normally.</P><P>Russian oil companies have been announcing plans to increase production so that an obligation to maintain the 300,000 b/d cut through the end of the year would be much more of a hardship. So far, all indications suggest that Moscow will go along with the extension, otherwise there could be another rapid drop in oil prices that would be even more harmful.</P><P><STRONG><U>5. Venezuela</U></STRONG></P><P>The situation continues to deteriorate and the month-long anti-government protests continue.  So far two dozen are dead, hundreds injured and 1,500 arrested. Hungry mobs roam the streets at night looting any place they can break into searching for food. The Maduro government has lost the support of the lower classes that brought Chavez to power.   The Pope is calling for mediation, and there is talk of a right-wing military coup.</P><P>Some oil companies are pulling out their foreign workers as living there has become dangerous.  China evacuated its oil executives to Columbia a year ago as they became prime targets for kidnappers. Foreign oil executives living in Caracas are forced to live in guarded compounds and travel only by armored vehicle.</P><P>Most observers are saying the Venezuela crisis is reaching some sort of a peak. The government has lost the support of nearly all the people and is ruling by decree. The food and medicine situation gets worse and it is likely that oil revenues are dropping. Although much of the oil production activity is located away from where the demonstrations are taking place and oil workers are likely to have the first call on food supplies after the security forces, the situation is bound to deteriorate. The country has little foreign reserves left and cannot import enough essential goods to keep functioning.</P><P>The risk of a major drop in oil exports remains high. The recent surge in US oil product exports to Latin America is likely tied to declining Venezuelan refining activity.  It is difficult to see how the situation will not get worse before it gets better.</P><P><STRONG><U>7.  The Briefs</U></STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Oil Sands:</STRONG> As global oil majors pull out of Canada’s oil sands, domestic companies are buying up assets and betting technology and economies of scale will enable them to turn a profit despite low crude prices. Global energy majors have sold off more than $22.5 billion worth of Canadian oil sands assets so far this year, concerned about depressed oil prices, high production costs and <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and limited pipeline access to market. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>BP</STRONG> has discovered 200 million barrels of oil in a hidden cache in the Gulf of Mexico, thanks to a technological breakthrough allowing the company to see beneath geological formations that had befuddled oil exploration for decades. The find, worth a potential $2 billion in recoverable oil, is in an undrilled section of BP’s Atlantis field in 7,000 feet of water 150 miles from New Orleans. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>Coal Shutdown</STRONG>: A Murray Energy subsidiary has notified an Illinois state agency that it plans to lay off 255 employees <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507395""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">in three months</SPAN></SPAN> in a move that industry sources say would likely shut one of the company’s top producing Illinois Basin mines. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>Rig Count</STRONG>: The number of active oil and gas rigs in the United States rose by 13 <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507396""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">on Friday</SPAN></SPAN>, according to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes. The total oil and gas rig count in the US now stands at 870 rigs, or 450 above the count a year ago. Oil rigs increased by 9, while gas rigs bumped up 4. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>Offshore Drilling</STRONG>: President Donald Trump signed an executive order <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507397""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">Friday</SPAN></SPAN> to ease regulations on offshore drilling and eventually allow more to occur, particularly in the Arctic Ocean. The order, which takes aim at last-minute Obama administration actions restricting drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, will likely have limited immediate impact owing to low oil prices, which make drilling in the affected areas economically unattractive.  Environmental groups said preparations are already underway for a legal challenge. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>The U.S. economy</STRONG> stumbled in the first months of the Trump administration, growing at the slowest pace <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507398""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">in three years</SPAN></SPAN> in a sobering reminder of the nation’s economic sluggishness. Gross domestic product grew at a 0.7% annual rate in the first quarter from the preceding three months, the Commerce Department said <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507399""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">Friday</SPAN></SPAN>. Economic output has grown an average of roughly 2% during the nearly eight-year expansion. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>Shale Gas:</STRONG> The number of rigs drilling for gas has almost doubled since August, but output continues to fall. Even accounting for a lag between the start of drilling and first production, the drop in output is striking — a well in the Marcellus Shale, America’s most prolific reservoir of the fuel, is producing about half of what it yielded a year ago, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Companies are struggling to overcome steep decline rates — the natural decrease in production — from shale formations that were the source of huge added supplies in years past. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>US gasoline demand</STRONG> fell 2.4 percent in February from a year earlier, the second straight monthly decline, according to data released <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507400""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">on Friday</SPAN></SPAN> by the U.S. Energy Information Administration that suggested the market may have trouble repeating last year’s record volumes. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>US supermajors</STRONG> exceed analysts’ estimates with cost cuts. Chevron turned a corner after its worst annual performance since 1980.  Fresh off Big Oil’s best quarter in years, Exxon Mobil and Chevron may be poised for a repeat. One-third of the way into the second quarter, crude prices — the prime driver of explorers’ profits — are 25 percent higher than a year ago. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>Pemex</STRONG>’s Board of Director approved its second-ever deepwater joint venture covering the Nobilis-Maximino block in the country’s territorial Gulf waters. (4/28)</P><P><STRONG>President Trump’</STRONG>s remarks about Alaska and senate measures on offshore drilling may point to an executive action on oil and gas. “We’re going to take care of Alaska too,” President Donald Trump told Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, during remarks on the signing of an executive order on national lands. “Don’t worry about it.” (4/28)</P><P><STRONG>Oil Futures</STRONG>: The number of outstanding oil contracts for delivery years into the future has plummeted on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Since 2012 open interest has declined by more than 75 percent for benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude expiring in three or four years’ time. During the same period, the entire WTI market has expanded by 40 per cent.  (4/28)</P><P><STRONG>ExxonMobil</STRONG> has continued its streak of hiking its dividend, announcing another increase in its payout to shareholders <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507401""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">on Wednesday</SPAN></SPAN>. The oil major has boosted its dividend every year for more than three decades, but the collapse of oil prices since 2014 has resulted in more scrutiny over the company’s payments to shareholders. (4/28)</P><P><STRONG>Polish energy company</STRONG>, PGNiG said <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507402""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">Thursday</SPAN></SPAN> it closed on a deal to take its first-ever shipment of liquefied natural gas sourced from reservoirs in the United States. PGNiG said its trading branch in London closed on a deal to accept LNG from Cheneire Energy, which owns a terminal in Louisiana that’s the only one with the permits necessary for current exports of U.S. natural gas. (4/28)</P><P><STRONG>Total </STRONG>gave the go-ahead <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507403""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">on Thursday</SPAN></SPAN> to develop its first major project since 2014 after reporting a sharp rise in quarterly profit that underscored its drive to cut costs throughout the oil price downturn. Total and its peers including Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil are cautiously refocusing on growth after years of slashing spending, which involved cutting thousands of jobs and scrapping major projects.

The revelation comes weeks after <mark>INEOS</mark> told local people that it had no intention of drilling inside the forest.</P><P>A fresh set of correspondence between <mark>INEOS</mark>’s land surveyors and the Forestry Commission, obtained by Friends of the Earth using Freedom of Information requests, reveals that they plan to put at least one drilling rig in The Lings, on the western edge of Sherwood Forest.</P><P>In an email dated 22 November 2016, <mark>INEOS</mark>’ land surveyors Fisher German Priestner wrote to the Forestry Commission concerning a “Proposed Well Site – The Lings at Clipstone”. The correspondence also contains maps showing a proposed well site in The Lings – at a spot just 500m from the Thynghowe, an ancient Viking assembly site deemed to be of international significance.</P><P>These woods lie within the boundary of the proposed Sherwood Forest Regional Park in an area identified as ‘The Heart of the Forest’; are well within the historic extent of Sherwood Forest; and are labelled as being part of Sherwood Forest on Ordnance Survey maps.</P><P><mark>INEOS</mark> have claimed that they have no plans to drill in Sherwood Forest. In a 2-page colour advert that they recently paid for in local papers, they state: “Despite what people may have read or heard, we have no intention of placing drilling rigs for shale wells inside the forest now or in the future”. </P><P><mark>INEOS</mark> have accused Friends of the Earth of “scaremongering” for revealing the company’s planned seismic surveys in Sherwood Wood. </P><P>Friends of the Earth campaigner, Guy Shrubsole, said:</P><P>“We already knew <mark>INEOS</mark> wanted to explore for shale gas in Sherwood Forest by carrying out seismic surveys – now, despite their assurances, we see they want to drill there, too.</P><P>“<mark>INEOS</mark> appear to have no qualms about drilling in what they call ‘arguably the most famous forest in the world’, and they are prepared to mislead communities about their intentions to get what they want.</P><P>“The <A data-entity-substitution=""canonical"" data-entity-type=""node"" data-entity-uuid=""3c69e7e3-e64e-4c84-b3b3-8c74d97a59b6"" href=""/<mark>climate</mark>-change/fracking"" title=""Fracking hub"">public don’t want fracking</A> and we don’t need it. <mark>INEOS</mark> should abandon its plans to frack in Nottinghamshire and invest in clean renewables instead.”</P><P>Local resident and member of Frack Free Sherwood, Deb Hodson, said:</P><P>&quot;Our beautiful historic woodland is the home to many ancient oaks, many species of wildlife and fauna. It is also a place of historic significance not only with its links to King John but also an important Danelaw meeting place. Our concerns around fracking in this area have been confirmed by <mark>INEOS</mark> themselves.</P><P>&quot;My hope is that now the general public can see the constant discrepancies that are being put forward by <mark>INEOS</mark>, they will research for themselves how this will affect our community.&quot; </P><P>-ends-</P><OL><LI>A map showing the extent of the proposed Sherwood Forest Regional / National Park is on the Nottinghamshire County Council website <A href=""http://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/DMS/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=5xZMhl1wM5gDa1x17C4bMxnrjUrfuSk77nmyM1MarsA6gCnk5c8QuA%3D%3D&amp;mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&amp;kCx1AnS9%2FpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&amp;uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2BAJvYtyA%3D%3D=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&amp;FgPlIEJYlotS%2BYGoBi5olA%3D%3D=NHdURQburHA%3D&amp;d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&amp;WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&amp;WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3D"">here</A>.

Similarly the petrochemicals sector requires competitively priced feedstocks.</P><P class=""Para"">1.2 Since the 1970’s North Sea oil and gas has provided the petrochemical industry with advantaged ethane and liquefied petroleum gases (propane and butane) feedstocks that have seen a successful petrochemical manufacturing industry grow based on a competitive olefins (ethylene and propylene) market. </P><P class=""Para"">1.3 This has been able to support downstream derivative manufacturing even though such products may be disadvantaged by distribution costs. UK derivatives today are exposed to global competition from low cost regions such as United States and Middle East E. The UK derivative portfolio (polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene vinyl chloride (PVC), ethanol, ethyl acetate (ETAC) and vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) in particular) cannot compete with low cost product unless the upstream feeds are competitive. Therefore, if feed costs into UK olefins manufacturing were to level with the rest of Europe, these derivatives would be outcompeted not only by their US and ME competitors, but also lose out against mainland European competitors who would then have similar costs but more differentiated derivatives and lower freight costs to serve the market.</P><P class=""Para"">1.4 Production forecasts for these advantaged petrochemical feedstocks from the North Sea show a marked decline at the end of this decade. Without a replacement advantaged feedstock the inevitable decline in UK olefins manufacturing industry, and therefore the associated downstream derivatives, is likely to follow.</P><P class=""Para"">1.5 For many years the UK has had access to locally sourced supplies of natural gas which have provided consumers with competitively priced energy supplies. As conventional reserves have declined, however, UK import dependency has increased with ever-greater volumes of gas being sourced from Norway and through LNG. As a result UK natural gas prices have become increasingly uncompetitive on a global scale.</P><P class=""Para"">1.6 The Government recognises that natural gas will play a vital part in the UK’s energy mix in the medium term (for both power generation and heat) ahead of the wider development of new nuclear and renewables.</P><P class=""Para"">1.7 In sharp contrast to the UK, the USA has seen energy and feedstock prices fall, import facilities converted for exportation and a rapid growth in petrochemicals manufacture all due to the extraction of shale gas. Furthermore, with gas prices falling below coal prices, the United States has seen overall CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions fall significantly as power generation switches to natural gas where possible.</P><P class=""Para"">1.8 It is clear that the UK potentially has very significant reserves of shale gas based on the results of surveys to date. It is likely that the UK’s shale deposits could contain higher weight hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s—essential feedstocks for the petrochemicals industry. Shale Gas deposits can contain these higher molecular-weight hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s (in addition to natural gas) that would re-invigorate the UK olefins and derivatives petrochemicals market. </P><P class=""Para"">1.9 <mark>INEOS</mark> believe it is this step change in advantaged feedstock for the petrochemicals market in the UK that is required and we will actively pursue both the import of such materials (in the short term) and the availability of UK supplies (in the long term) to maintain our UK manufacturing base</P><P class=""Para"">1.10 UK shale reserves have the potential to provide the UK with a secure, indigenous and highly competitive source of energy and hydro<mark>carbon</mark> feedstocks—in essence providing a replacement for declining output from conventional North Sea reserves. Rather than requiring support and subsidy (like renewables), or requiring energy to be bought externally, UK shale would provide a vital source of income to UK plc.</P><P class=""Para"">1.11 The UK energy intensive and petrochemicals sectors require certainty that energy and feedstocks will be secure and competitive in the medium term. Without that certainty then it is likely that these sectors will decline and reducing the manufacturing capacity. However if shale develops positively then the prospects for manufacturing to build and grow on the current significant UK supply infrastructure are good.</P><P class=""Para"">1.12 The UK has a proven track record of technological development in oil and gas production and manufacturing. Recent reports show that shale gas is no riskier than current fuel extraction technologies and can be managed safely.</P><P class=""Para"">1.13 It is vital that UK government supports and encourages the responsible development of shale gas.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading"">2. <SPAN class=""smallcaps"">The Importance of Natural Gas and Hydro<mark>carbon</mark> Feedstocks</SPAN></H2><P class=""Para"">2.1 For many years natural gas has been a key part of the UK’s primary fuel mix. Large indigenous reserves in the North Sea have provided the UK with a competitive source of energy for power generation.</P><P class=""Para"">2.2 In addition to natural gas, the North Sea provides other hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s such as ethane and propane which are vital feedstocks for the petrochemicals and plastics industry. Availability of these feedstocks has resulted in the UK having had a successful petrochemicals sector.</P><P class=""Para"">2.3 However forecasts of these fundamental advantaged feedstocks show a steep decline at the turn of the decade. It is imperative that alternatives are found to sustain UK manufacturing and exports in these sectors.</P><P class=""Para"">2.4 The so called “dash for gas” saw a transformation of the power generation industry with the widespread displacement of coal resulting in a significant fall in UK <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.</P><P class=""Para"">2.5 UK government policy is to further de<mark>carbon</mark>ise the UK economy—and much of this will have to be achieved through the de<mark>carbon</mark>isation of the power generation sector. </P><P class=""Para"">2.6 In the medium term the UK Government recognises that natural gas will continue to play a vital role in power generation, both as a back-up for interruptible renewables and ahead of the deployment of a new generation of nuclear stations in UK (excluding Scotland) and Scottish Governments off shore wind and wave generation.</P><P class=""Para"">2.7 As a critical “bridging fuel” it is essential that natural gas prices remain competitive in the UK Gas prices determine wholesale electricity prices and critically important for the energy intensive sector.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading"">3. <SPAN class=""smallcaps"">UK and the US—Contrasting Recent History of Natural Gas</SPAN></H2><P class=""Para"">3.1 Following the discovery of natural gas in the North Sea, the UK for many years enjoyed the benefits of plentiful gas supplies. This resulted in gas prices which were relatively competitive. The construction of the UK to Belgium interconnector also enabled large volumes of gas to be sold and exported to the wider European market.</P><P class=""Para"">3.2 During the mid 2010’s UK indigenous production was seen to decline quite rapidly as field depletion exceeded new discoveries. As a result the UK has moved to becoming a net gas importer. This has resulted in prices being on average higher and exposed to external global factors.</P><P class=""Para"">3.3 In particular the UK is now increasingly dependent upon imports of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). While there is no recognised global market for LNG (as there is for oil for example) it is very clear that the price and availability of LNG is affected by the global supply and demand balance and other risk factors. For example following the global financial collapse of 2008, LNG availability kept UK prices relatively low and competitive whereas after the Fukushima nuclear incident, increased demand for LNG has seen a significantly tightening of the LNG market and prices increasing.</P><P class=""Para"">3.4 This tightening of the LNG supply/demand balance has caused UK prices to rise significantly. (Price evolution is shown in Addendum 1).</P><P class=""Para"">3.5 Natural gas prices have now risen above the equivalent cost of coal for the generation of power. This has resulted in power generators increasing power generation on coal stations and reducing generation on gas stations. With coal stations emitting more <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide per unit of power generated, this has resulted in UK emissions increasing (we estimate that UK CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions increased by around 25 million tonnes in 2011 alone).</P><P class=""Para"">3.6 The gas price is critical in determining the price of wholesale electricity. Increasing wholesale gas prices have caused wholesale electricity prices to increase. With the UK generation mix being more dependent on gas than most of other European markets, this has resulted in UK wholesale prices rising to highly uncompetitive levels. When tax policy is taken into account the situation in the UK is even worse. (Electricity price comparisons are shown in Addendum 2).</P><P class=""Para"">3.7 In the United States the situation is nearly the complete reverse. In the late 2010s the US expected that it would need to import large quantities of LNG and as a result a number of import terminals were built.</P><P class=""Para"">3.8 At the same time, advances were made in the recovery of shale gas. Development was so rapid that by the time terminals were constructed, US shale gas production had grown enough that imports were simply not required and the new terminals remained very largely unused.</P><P class=""Para"">3.9 The growth of shale gas also pushed prices down very significantly—far more than many had predicted. The contrast is now stark with the US enjoying natural gas prices which are around 30% of the levels we see in the UK. </P><P class=""Para"">3.10 In addition to the extraction of natural gas (methane), large quantities of larger hydro<mark>carbon</mark> molecules are being extracted (ethane and propane). This advantaged feedstock has helped to drive a resurgence in US olefin production and the downstream olefin-derivative industries. The next few years will see the US bring on line olefin production based on shale gas, and will see the US challenge the Middle East for the title of low-cost producer of olefins and therefore olefin-derivatives.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading"">4. <SPAN class=""smallcaps"">Impact of Shale in the US</SPAN></H2><P class=""Para"">4.1 The growth of shale gas in the US has had profound impacts.</P><P class=""Para"">4.2 The increased availability of chemical feedstocks has seen investment increase significantly in ethane crackers announced. For example on 1 June 2012 ICIS Heren reported that “US-based ExxonMobil Chemical’s announcement of a new 1.5m tonne/year cracker in Texas by 2016 brings the tally of new US ethylene capacity announcements to 33% of existing capacity”<I>. </I></P><P class=""Para"">4.3 US natural gas prices have fallen dramatically and are now around the lowest in the world—certainly of the transparent liquidly traded markets. </P><P class=""Para"">4.4 Rather than being a net importer, the US is now expected to be a net gas exporter, with a number of major liquefaction projects announced (in part using the terminals that were constructed to import gas). Thus, rather than exporting money to buy gas, the US will have a large new revenue stream.</P><P class=""Para"">4.5 Lower gas prices have resulted in a lowering of electricity prices, giving a massive competitive advantage to the US electro-intensive industries </P><P class=""Para"">4.6 Natural gas is now more competitive than coal for power generation in the US—so gas has displaced coal in the power generation sector. As a result the US has seen a significant reduction in CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions.</P><P class=""Para"">4.7 There are a number of other reports that show the impact of shale gas is having on the US manufacturing sector which is now clearly growing. Selections of these are quoted in Addendum 4.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading"">5. <SPAN class=""smallcaps"">Shale Gas Potential in the UK</SPAN></H2><P class=""Para"">5.1 Shale gas in the UK has the ability to be transformational in delivering secure and competitive energy and feedstock supplies which are vital for the energy intensive and petrochemicals sectors. </P><P class=""Para"">5.2 It is apparent, albeit on limited surveys that the UK has significant and world class shale deposits. The Bowland shale for example is reported to be five times the thickness of the Marcellus shale in the US.</P><P class=""Para"">5.3 Technically, there are reports from respected bodies that shale extraction can be achieved with no greater risk than current extractive technologies. Indeed the UK has well established arrangements in a wide variety of industries for responsibly managing environmental and other risks. The US has demonstrated the technology which should be readily transferable. Indeed, shale gas extraction has been undertaken in Germany for many years without technical or environmental issues.</P><P class=""Para"">5.4 Furthermore, the UK has a very strong track record when it comes to putting new infrastructure in place. The development of a massive oil and gas production and transmission infrastructure was achieved in a relatively short period in arguably a much more challenging environment. There is no reason to suggest that given the right <mark>climate</mark> that this could not be replicated for shale gas production.</P><P class=""Para"">5.5 The UK should be looking to achieve “first mover” advantage. With an established gas and petrochemicals infrastructure already in place we only require a competitive source of supply to replace dwindling indigenous North Sea reserves to sustain our remaining energy intensive and petrochemicals sectors. </P><P class=""Para"">5.6 The benefits to industry are only part of the story with many wider spin-off benefits, which seem certain to enhance the prospects of the UK manufacturing and wider economy.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading"">6 <SPAN class=""smallcaps"">Conclusions</SPAN></H2><P class=""Para"">6.1 UK olefins manufacturing in the UK is sustained by advantaged feedstock pricing from North Sea gases (ethane, propane and butane) that provides support to the associated UK olefins derivatives manufacturing base (that are disadvantaged by greater transportation and freight costs to the inland European market). If feed costs into UK olefins manufacturing were to level with the rest of Europe, these derivatives would be outcompeted not only by their US and ME competitors, but also lose out against mainland European competitors who would then have similar costs but more differentiated derivatives and lower freight costs to serve the market. New sources of advantaged feedstock are required to maintain a UK olefins and derivatives manufacturing base.</P><P class=""Para"">6.2  UK energy prices are already uncompetitive. The UK’s energy tax and policy framework indicate that the competiveness gap is only set to increase.</P><P class=""Para"">6.3 For energy intensive manufacturers, such as olefins and derivatives producers, energy is a major component of productions costs: accessing competitively priced energy is simply business critical.</P><P class=""Para"">6.4 Shale gas offers an opportunity that must not be rejected if the UK is to remain a competitive location for energy intensive industries.</P><P class=""Para"">6.5 <mark>INEOS</mark> strongly supports the responsible development of shale gas in the UK. We consider it vital to the long-term success of our manufacturing operations in the UK.</P><P class=""Para"">6.6 We encourage UK Government to support the development of shale gas. Unlike renewables and new nuclear, this support will not need to be financial. Rather the need will be in areas such as licensing and planning. Indeed, UK plc will reap massive financial benefit from a successful shale gas industry.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading"">7 <SPAN class=""smallcaps"">Responses to Questions</SPAN></H2><P class=""Para"">In response to the questions raised by the Committee we have provided comments below (where we feel it is appropriate to comment).</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading""><I>What are the estimates for the amount of shale gas in place in the UK, Europe, and the rest of the world, and what proportion is recoverable? </I></H2><P class=""Para"">We are not experts in this area and only have access to information that has been made publically available.</P><P class=""Para"">In the UK it is apparent that information on reserves is evolving as test drilling is required in order to gather concrete information on shale quality. It is apparent that views are changing rapidly but generally new information is leading to ever more optimistic forecasts.</P><P class=""Para"">The proportion of recoverable reserves is also uncertain. However, assuming conservatively that just 10% of reserves are recoverable then we estimate that the Bowland Shale has the capacity to produce 30% of the volume of gas that has been extracted from UK conventional fields since 1970. In view of this we think it is reasonable to say that extracting shale gas would be comparable to rediscovering the North Sea. </P><P class=""Para"">Globally, new information is published on a near daily basis indicating that massive shale deposits lie across the planet. China, for example has the largest reserves, and with a gas market of similar size to the UK, reserves to demand ratios are around 250 years.</P><P class=""Para"">Germany also has significant reserves and with shale extraction having been undertaken for many years, we anticipate that shale development will see further growth.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading""><I>Why are the estimates for shale gas so changeable? </I></H2><P class=""Para"">We are not experts but exploration to date is limited. As exploration continues it is apparent that shale deposits are large, tend to surpass expectations and are globally diverse.</P><P class=""Para"">It is clear that other countries are likely to pursue shale development (as the US has done) and we see it as essential that the UK, with a strong track record on gas production and an existing good infrastructure that we seize early mover advantage.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading""><I>What are the prospects for offshore shale gas in the UK Continental Shelf? </I></H2><P class=""Para"">We have no particular view on the relative merits of off-shore versus on-shore shale gas extraction. However, in either case we think it essential that UK Government support the development of the industry particularly through the granting of exploration and development licences.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading""><I>Should the UK consider setting up a wealth fund with the tax revenue from shale gas? </I></H2><P class=""Para"">We have no strong view on the merits of setting up specifically a wealth fund. However, it is apparent that the UK economy will boosted significantly if we continue to produce (and potentially export) indigenous gas rather than import supplies from other parts of the globe at higher and uncompetitive prices.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading""><I>What have been the effects of shale gas on the LNG industry? </I></H2><P class=""Para"">As already discussed, the US will become a gas exporter of natural gas. Others will follow. Better that the UK is an early mover.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading""><I>Could shale gas lead to the emergence of a single, global gas market? </I></H2><P class=""Para"">Potentially shale could improve the prospects of a global gas market developing. However, if we do not embrace indigenous shale gas extraction we will remain a large importer forced to accept prices and exposed to geo-political risk.</P><P class=""Para"">Further, local gas production has the very clear potential to grow local industry through production and providing competitive energy and feedstock supplies for energy intensive and petrochemical sectors.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading""><I>What are the effects on investment in lower-<mark>carbon</mark> energy technologies? </I></H2><P class=""Para"">The development of shale gas should be seen as providing the bridge to a lower <mark>carbon</mark> economy. UK <mark>carbon</mark> emissions were reduced massively in the period known as “the dash for gas”. We have already noted that with gas prices currently higher than coal, <mark>carbon</mark> emissions in 2011 were higher than they would otherwise have been.</P><P class=""Para"">Further, it is clear that the deployment of significant levels of low <mark>carbon</mark> generation infrastructure remains many years away. Renewables will inevitably require back-up generation and any new nuclear seems very unlikely before 2020. Gas will be required to provide the bridge in the short to medium term—and shale gas can provide this without the need for expensive economic support mechanisms. </P><P class=""Para"">In the long term, whether gas will affect the deployment of new nuclear and renewables will have to be determined by policy and economic views. For example, will cheap gas combined with <mark>Carbon</mark> Capture and Storage provide a more economic, secure and acceptable source of power generation?</P><P class=""Para"">Predicting the future is without question uncertain. However, shale gas can offer another route to secure, competitive and lower <mark>carbon</mark> energy—and it should not be ruled out of the energy mix at this stage</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading""><I>What is the potential impact on <mark>climate change</mark> objectives of greater use of shale gas?</I></H2><P class=""Para"">Again the US offers a view of potential benefits. We note two examples.</P><P class=""Para"">First, shale gas has lowered prices such that natural gas is now the preferred fuel for power generation. As a result US <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions have fallen massively. Increased use of shale gas in the UK or ROW has the ability to reduce coal burn provided it is cheaper than coal. </P><P class=""Para"">Secondly, gas is already being used as an alternative to liquid hydro<mark>carbon</mark> fuels, offering reductions in emissions.</P><P class=""Para"">Thus, greater use of shale gas can provide a route to lower <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by displacing use of fuels with higher <mark>carbon</mark> intensity.</P><P class=""Para"">Of course shale gas is not <mark>carbon</mark> free. While <mark>Carbon</mark> Capture and Storage is still to be proven on a commercial scale, it would be an obvious partner to shale gas in providing a zero <mark>carbon</mark> but secure energy supply in the longer term.</P><P class=""ParaFull-Out""> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The U.K. has also over-committed to wind power and should be investing more in solar energy, he said.</P><P>Without a sound energy policy, the country risks falling behind other countries trying to develop low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy capacity. Big energy users such as <mark>Ineos</mark> also need stable policies when making their long-term investment plans.</P><P>“The government has done quite a lot, let’s be clear, and we wouldn’t blame them for excitement over nuclear,” Crotty said in an interview in London. “We just think the strategy is totally wrong.”</P><P>Going ahead with Hinkley was a strategic decision to ensure Britain has a diverse energy mix, the U.K. Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, or BEIS, said in an emailed reply to questions. “Consumers won’t pay a penny until Hinkley is built.”</P><P>Britain’s Hinkley Point C project, the first new nuclear plant in a generation, may cost consumers 30 billion pounds ($38 billion) or more in higher electricity costs, five times more than ministers had expected, the government’s auditor <A itemscope=""itemscope"" itemprop=""StoryLink"" href=""/news/terminal/OS02JT6S972W"" title=""U.K. Told Hinkley Subsidy Costs May Spiral Past $38 Billion (2)"" class=""terminal-news-story"" target=""_blank"">warned</A> last week. Its investigation concluded ministers failed to consider cheaper options for delivering the plant.</P><P>The National Audit Office urged the government to come up with a “Plan B” for electricity supplies in case of the nuclear project’s collapse. Hinkley Point C is to be built by Electricite de France SA and China General Nuclear Power Group.</P><H3>Gas Bet</H3><P>London-based <mark>Ineos</mark> has bet natural gas, which emits half the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide of coal when burned, is an inexpensive and reliable way to help countries transition to a future completely based on renewables.

It also seeks to develop shale gas resources in Britain and hopes to drill test wells this year.</P><P>Building new gas-fired power plants to fill a gap caused by a three-year delay in Hinkley Point C could save the U.K. 3.2 billion pounds through 2030, according to <A itemscope=""itemscope"" itemprop=""StoryLink"" href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/621400/Detailed_value_for_money_assessment.pdf"" title=""Click to view webpage."" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">analysis</A> by BEIS that assumes low gas prices. Filling the delay using offshore wind and <mark>carbon</mark> capture technology would cost the nation 7.3 billion pounds. Hinkley is expected to be built by 2025.</P><P>“In terms of the savings through building gas, if we took this option we wouldn’t meet our <mark>climate</mark>-change target in 2050,” BEIS said by email. It expects a price on greenhouse gas emissions to “add greater weight to the costs of gas in the 2030s, 2040s and beyond.”</P><P>The government has been supportive of natural gas and should continue to encourage production and consumption of the fuel, according to Crotty.

He described the statement to Parliament on 3<SUP>rd</SUP> October 2017, when Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse MSP announced that the Scottish Government would not support fracking, as a statement of preferred policy, rather than a decision. Since a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) was required in relation to an actual policy decision of this sort, and indeed such an SEA was currently underway, clearly no decision had been made at this stage, therefore the petition was premature and should be refused. Further, when the Minister described the position of the Government as an ‘effective ban’ this was nothing more than ‘a gloss’ – a means of communicating perhaps, but not a fact of law.</P><P>This line of argument could strike at the very heart of the petition according to the judge hearing the case, Lord Pentland, who urged Gerry Moynihan QC for <mark>INEOS</mark> and Reach CSG to consider what remained of their grounds for challenge in light of this fundamental point.</P><P>Should Lord Pentland be persuaded by this argument, the case could potentially be settled on this point alone, avoiding the need to determine the merits of <mark>INEOS</mark> and Reach’s arguments on the 6 grounds of challenge.</P><P>However, were this to transpire, any sense of victory felt by those of us who fought for and support the fracking ban may be short-lived: once the SEA process is complete, and a decision has been finally made, <mark>Ineos</mark> and Reach would be free once again to seek to legally challenge that decision.</P><P>The hearing will start again tomorrow at 10am and has a total of four days scheduled in court.</P><P>*****</P><P>We are making a public interest intervention in the case arguing that the Scottish Government was obliged to ban fracking in order to meet its own legally binding <mark>climate change</mark> commitments.

The company, which recently moved its headquarters from Switzerland back to Britain, wants to invest 1 billion pounds into shale gas which it bets on as a feedstock for its petrochemicals business. </P><P>Engie, on the other hand, said its retreat from British shale gas was in line with its strategy to focus more on energy infrastructure, like gas pipelines, and services. </P><P>“The decision was made following ENGIE Group’s strategic review notably in response to commodity price declines,” said a spokeswoman.

            Rotherham Borough Council rejected application for exploratory shale gas drilling near Harthill

          </DIV><DIV class=""foe-page-copy""><P>Rotherham Borough Council planners today rejected the application by chemicals giant <mark>INEOS</mark> to conduct exploratory drills for shale gas near the village of Harthill in South Yorkshire, to the delight of campaigners.</P><P>This decision shows that industry plans can be frustrated, and that community coordination can result in big wins. Campaigners will be bolstered by today’s news, and people in other areas where exploratory drilling is proposed will also claim this as a victory against the industry – though the fight is not yet over with an Inquiry pending.</P><P>This is the first application for exploratory drilling by <mark>INEOS</mark> to be considered by a local planning committee in England. The company has ambitious plans [1] to drill numerous fracking wells across the Midlands and North of England. <mark>INEOS</mark> has also applied to conduct test drills near Eckington (Derbyshire) and Woodsetts (also in Rotherham) - both within 10 miles of the Harthill site and due to be considered by local planners shortly.</P><P><mark>INEOS</mark> has recently applied to the Planning Inspectorate for the Eckington and Harthill applications to be decided by a government appointed planning inspector because it believes “no local decisions have been made in a reasonable time period” [2]. Today’s decision by Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council is an important consideration for the planning inspector in the planning inquiry which could take place as early as May. Rotherham MBC officers had recommended that Councillors reject the planning application at today’s hearing.</P><P>Deborah Gibson, campaigner with Harthill Against Fracking, said:</P><P>“This is excellent news for Harthill! The much bigger fight against the development of fracking here and in other surrounding areas, has received a boost today. It means that local democratic processes have allowed the people of Harthill to say NO and to be heard and validated by the local planning system. The next step is to take our fight to the Public Inquiry later this year. We hope the inspector will understand that the plans for fracking exploration site at Harthill are unacceptable for all the reasons stated today by the RMBC Planning Committee”.</P><P>Richard Dyer, campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said:</P><P>“It’s great that today Rotherham planners have listened to local community concerns and rightly decided that the impacts of this proposal would be damaging and unacceptable. We now look forward to supporting the Council’s position at the public inquiry.”</P><P>“We know that we have to leave the majority of fossil fuel resources in the ground if we are to prevent dangerous <mark>climate change</mark>, so it makes absolutely no sense to investigate the potential for fracking.”</P><P>Dave Kesteven, campaigner with Eckington Against Fracking, said:</P><P>“I’m absolutely delighted that the council have decided to support those who elect them and not a multinational plastics manufacturer whose activities would disrupt our communities and pollute our environment.</P><P>&quot;I am sure that this victory will be repeated at the public inquiry and sets a heartening precedent for our village of Marsh Lane which is fighting a similar threat.”</P><P>Andy Tickle, director of CPRE South Yorkshire, said:</P><P>&quot;We are pleased that the Council's Planning Board has decided that drilling in this sensitive location is inappropriate and that the impacts were not fully evaluated. We will be strongly supporting the Council at the public inquiry that will now be held to decide the application.&quot;</P><P>Harthill Against Fracking, Friends of the Earth and CPRE spoke at the planning hearing at Rotherham Town Hall this afternoon. They are available for broadcast interviews.</P><P>Notes: 1. <A href=""https://www.<mark>ineos</mark>.com/news/shared-news/<mark>ineos</mark>-adds-to-shale-gas-licence-portfolio/""><mark>INEOS</mark> owns </A>1.2million acres of PEDLs (Petroleum Exploration and Development Licences) across the UK and announced in 2014 that it wants to be the <A href=""https://www.<mark>ineos</mark>.com/businesses/<mark>ineos</mark>-shale/news/<mark>ineos</mark>-moves-to-become-biggest-player-in-the-uk-shale-gas-industry/"">biggest player </A>in the UK fracking industry.</P><P>2.

“proportionate to all parties – including yourselves (<mark>Ineos</mark>)”.</P><P>It said the threat of a terrorist attack on energy installations at the time was deemed “possible but not

Such behaviour suggests that this company was not prioritising the health and security of our communities. </P><P>“It's time to back industries that can deliver clean, renewable power without threatening our safety or <mark>climate</mark>. Investment in clean technologies, like ever-cheaper offshore wind and battery storage, will reduce emissions and provide security, economic growth, skilled jobs and fair bills.”</P><P>He also pointed out that <mark>Ineos</mark> owned a large number of fracking licenses in the UK.</P><P>“With the Scottish Government set to decide on the future of fracking in Scotland this year, they should ask themselves if they really want to open the door for a company like <mark>Ineos</mark> to frack the Scottish countryside,” Mr Sauven said.</P><P><mark>Ineos</mark> did not respond to requests for comment, made on Sunday, from <EM>The Independent</EM>.</P><P>However an <mark>Ineos</mark> spokesperson told Greenpeace Energydesk: “We cannot go into detail on our security arrangements at our sites, some of which is confidential for obvious reasons. </P><P>“However, I can say that the safety and security of each of our sites around the world is our highest priority. </P><P>“Our sites vary considerably in terms of their size, composition and location and so the security arrangements, which are reviewed on a regular basis, are specifically developed to take into account the specific risk and situation of each facility.”</P><P>“We work closely with local and national authorities and emergency and security services in shaping and monitoring our security arrangements and procedures, which are tested regularly. </P><P>“The document you are referring to dates back almost seven years to 2010.

The <mark>Ineos</mark> majority shareholder, Jim Ratcliffe, claims fracking could regenerate northern Britain despite evidence that the strategy is “a mirage that would lead to a mountain of debt and a mountain of garbage”.</STRONG></EM></P><P><EM>Base Fortune, now I see, that in thy wheel
There is a point, to which when men aspire,
They tumble headlong down..</EM></P><P>– Christopher Marlowe – from his play “Edward the Second”</P><P>Let’s start with the BIG STORY. Any PR or advertising agency will tell their clients that they have to have a story. The story can amuse, stimulate or inspire. The aim of this is to emotionally engage with the public or a market segment. They are invited to identify with the story, to become a part of it, to share in the action.</P><P>For example, here’s a story in just two letters and two words: “BP” meaning “Beyond Petroleum”. It explained how that company saw its future. OK, the story went, we are a fossil fuel company – but we are trying to move in the right direction – so fill up at a BP station before we’ve got the solar panels in place. OK? </P><P>Then, in 2010, disaster struck the Beyond Petroleum story in the Gulf of Mexico. A vast marine eco-system was trashed by a  leaking well drilled from a BP Platform called “Deepwater Horizon”. A huge media storm focused on the shoddy reality behind the slogan “Beyond Petroleum”. BP was now perceived as a reckless and aggressive company that played little heed to safety or environment. In this media storm Tony Hayward, the Chief Executive of BP, made it worse for the company and himself. Someone leaked that in a private meeting he had asked his fellow executives: “What the hell did we do to deserve this?”. He was thereafter repeatedly asked how could he ask such a stupid question.</P><P>PR, if based on a flawed story, or on a lie, has a way of turning against those who attempt to make use of it.</P><H2>The <mark>Ineos</mark> Saga</H2><P>So what is the inspiring story for <mark>Ineos</mark> – the company 2/3 owned by the Beverley Grammar School Boy made good, long distant runner, team leader, international business magnate Jim Ratcliffe?  Many people will remember Ratcliffe and his company as the one that moved its HQ to Switzerland to avoid paying UK taxes so it has struggled with its PR – however, nowadays Ratcliffe and <mark>Ineos</mark> want to be associated with another story and this article is about having a critical look at it. This is the narrative in which, by supporting the fracking of shale, Britain will gain a cheap new energy source that will revive manufacturing, leading to the regeneration of large parts of the north of England and of Scotland. </P><P>By combining £600 million of <mark>Ineos</mark> money with the fracking expertise that they have bought in from the USA, and adding these together with the ” understanding of extractive industries” that communities in the North of England possess after coal mining… great things can happen. Jobs. Industry.  Who knows, perhaps <mark>Ineos</mark> might pay some tax too…
But what’s really going to happen? Every good story has high stakes and an uncertain ending. There’s no dramatic tension otherwise. As the Hero embarks on the great journey there are challenges and doubts over whether they will succeed. To add tension the tests and challenges, the rewards and risks get bigger. In the <mark>Ineos</mark> saga it started as an innovating entrepreneur creating a new company. The name of <mark>Ineos</mark> is derived from Greek words conveying <mark>innovation</mark> and newness. Now, many years later, the story is whether the company will go bust – or whether it will become the saviour of Northern Britain’s industrial legacy. </P><P>There are different kinds of stories. In one kind the apparent hero is found wanting. Some stories are about hubris – about people who overestimate themselves, discover limits that they did not know existed, find themselves in a spot of difficulty, perhaps gambling to escape their predicament – and it all ends unhappily. To be a really good tragedy the chief protagonist does not just make practical and strategic mistakes. The story ends badly because ethical or moral tests are failed too.</P><H2>The <mark>Ineos</mark> Gamble</H2><P>In the <mark>Ineos</mark> story there is no certainty about the ending either. The desire to frack in the UK is an expensive gamble and it could go wrong in lots of different ways. Here are a few of those ways: </P><P>There could be insufficient gas for fracking to be commercially viable.  In Poland in 2011 there was an idea that there was about to be a shale gas bonanza. 75 exploratory wells were sunk. 25 were fracked and although gas was found the flow was between 10% and 33% of what would be needed for commercial viability. So the gas exploration companies lost interest. If that were to happen to <mark>Ineos</mark> in the UK it would be a disaster for them in this country. Instead of <mark>Ineos</mark> making northern Britain Great Again it could easily go bust like it nearly did shortly after the financial crisis of 2008. Here’s why…</P><P><mark>Ineos</mark> is a business empire constructed out of the pieces that other petro-chemical companies didn’t want – where the pieces for the construction were paid for by borrowing. That’s why their company propaganda is not only full of stuff about their technological prowess but about their skill at handling their finances . They are proud of their ability to juggle with their debt arrangements. It’s also why they are so desperate to get cheap UK feedstock and cheap energy for their chemical operations at Grangemouth and Runcorn. Cheap gas in the USA extracted by fracking has been useful to them in their operations there. They are trying to survive in a global market and want cheap gas, extracted on the spot, for their UK operations too. They are prepared to gamble money on the hope that this is possible.  If they don’t get that cheap gas they not only lose that investment, they are stuck with the problem of how to find cheap energy and ethane as North Sea gas fields decline.</P><P>There is massive overcapacity in the chemicals industry as the chart shows. When there is overcapacity in an industry there is fierce competition. Each company tries to ensure that it is their business rivals that suffer from idle production facilities while they succeed in keeping busy. A glut of products pushes down prices –  which, in this case, means a glut of plastics. The name of the game is not expansion – it is survival – so that other companies go out of business and not the one that you are running. </P><P>While <mark>Ineos</mark> are telling us about regeneration, expansion and jobs, in their private business discussions they will probably be talking about what how to deal with an ageing population and stagnant markets for generic products, about how to deal with competitors in other countries producing the same products but with lower energy costs, about Chinese competition and about what to do in a recession. They will also be discussing what to do if, as looks increasingly likely, there is another credit crunch like 2007-2008. <mark>Ineos</mark> are still dependent on debt finance. </P><P>To repeat, <mark>Ineos</mark> want to frack to reduce their costs of production because they are in a corner. Ratcliffe may want to believe himself the regenerator of the North of Britain – that he will win through against the odds, that he will prove wrong any people who doubted him along the way  – but some chemical companies are likely to go out of business. The way it’s going one of them could be his.</P><H2>Where the <mark>Ineos</mark> fantasy comes from</H2><P>The international chemicals industry in general and plastics in particular are in a hyper competitive state.  In a hyper competitive state <mark>Ineos</mark> are disadvantaged by energy prices in Europe that are higher than elsewhere in the world. In 2011 <mark>Ineos</mark> testified to the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee that there was a problem with a high <mark>carbon</mark> price in the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme. It would make British and European companies that use a lot of energy uncompetitive with places like China. There was a danger, they argued, that their competitors outside Europe would win.  The emissions would occur in China rather than Britain and Europe and they might be driven out of business. We have an important role in “the Green Economy” they claimed, pointing at their development of technological  processes to develop fuel and electricity from municipal waste. However there had to be a way of squaring the circle on European <mark>climate policy</mark> – because all that was happening was that European policy was driving high energy (= high <mark>carbon</mark>) industrial operations like chemicals and plastics to China where the greenhouse gas emissions of production were even higher than in Britain and Europe. The chemicals, plastics and industrial products were being exported back to Europe and companies like <mark>Ineos</mark> were losing markets.</P><P>That was in 2011 and the story moved on. <mark>Ineos</mark> companies in the USA were finding their costs lowered by using gas from fracking and Ratcliffe and his management team were looking to import that gas into the UK by building ships especially designed to carry liquified gas. But this was only an imperfect interim solution for the <mark>Ineos</mark> UK operations.  While cheap in America the gas is not so cheap for <mark>Ineos</mark> over here after paying the toll for liquifying it and the costs of transporting it.  A far better solution for the needs of <mark>Ineos</mark> seemed to be for the UK to develop its own fracking industry seemed to be..  The North Sea as the major UK source for natural gas is in decline but the big idea now was that onshore gas from fracking would not only revive the fortunes of <mark>Ineos</mark> but of all energy intensive economic sectors. That has been the apparent epiphany – under the leadership of Ratcliffe a grandiose vision of industrial regeneration was born.  However, to be missionaries for shale and fracking, you have to brush the problems under a carpet.</P><P>According to Ratcliffe, quoted in the <EM>Guardian</EM>, “a lot of the opposition to fracking is based on hearsay and rumour”. In fact there are now nearly 700 academic articles published between 2009 and the end of 2015 about fracking, public health and the environment. The overwhelming majority of the studies that contain field data show potential or actual contamination of water or air. 31 of the studies assess the dangers to public health – <A href=""http://www.psehealthyenergy.org/site/view/1233"">26 of them indicate public health hazards, elevated risks or adverse health outcomes. http://www.psehealthyenergy.org/site/view/1233</A></P><H2>Decision making under conditions of uncertainty – making up your mind and then sticking to it</H2><P>It is difficult to be sure without knowing him a lot better how Ratcliffe came to say and apparently believe that opposition to fracking is based on hearsay. It brings to mind the comment of BP’s Tony Hayward mentioned earlier. It raises interesting questions about how aware and self aware are many “captains of industry”. One of the most interesting sides of economic theory which overlaps with human psychology is  decision making under conditions of uncertainty.  That’s decision making where you know some things, where you think you know some things and where there are a lot of things that you don’t know. Daniel Kahneman, who won what is called the Nobel Prize for Economics, has particularly focused on this. For Kahneman a crucial feature of good decision making is not to overestimate the importance and significance of what you think that you know – while at the same time underestimating what you don’t know. This is very difficult because people construct their interpretation of the world from what they know. Indeed they may feel particularly proud of their specialist and professional knowledge. They may feel that it gives them unique and special insights, have an expertise that other people lack that makes them THE industry experts on a particular matter. In the anti fracking struggle one sees this all the time from some rather arrogant engineers and geologists who feel that they are uniquely qualified to opine on fracking (or indeed other topics too )– not acknowledging that environmental scientists, public health professionals, economists, <mark>climate</mark> scientists and many others each have professional and scientific angles on the matter that is also worthy of consideration and respect. In Germany there is even a special name for this kind of person – a Fachidiot – where Fach means a specialist subject discipline and idiot means idiot – a greek word for someone who focused exclusively on their private interests and did not take an interest in wider politics and public affairs.  </P><P>Of course everyone tends to underestimate what they don’t know in favour of what they do know (or think they know). It is not just a problem among frackademics. In his book, <EM>Thinking Fast and Slow</EM>, Kahneman labels the common fallacy that underpins most of how we interpret and decide about things – he calls it the WYSIATI  fallacy – What You See Is All There Is.  It is related to “optimism bias” and “planning fallacy” – assuming things will work as we plan them, on time and on budget, because of not realising that there will always be unknown unknowns to drive us off track. This “optimism bias” is a feature too of expectations for health and safety and environmental consequences. Other people call this Murphy’s Law. If things can go wrong then eventually they will. And they sure as hell will for <mark>Ineos</mark> too.</P><P>Of course what we see is not all there is – the German philosopher Heidegger describes our experience of being in the world with the metaphor of being in a clearing in a forest – what we see are what’s in the clearing but beyond that things remain unknown to us. (“Die Lichtung des Seins” in German – where Lichtung means clearing and Sein means ‘being’. It is helpful perhaps to notice that in German the word Lichtung contains the word  Licht – light, that which illuminates). Others speak of a “cloud of unknowing”. In different circumstances politicians and military types speak of the “fog of war”.  To get a proper sense of where we are really, it helps to realise that we are lost. Yet there are some kinds of people who have to give the appearance of knowing just where they are, and exactly what they are doing all the time, otherwise these wizards would freak the markets and scare away the people who follow their leadership and lend them money. Then there is a certain kind of stupid economist who claims that, while each individual only has a partial view, all market actors together have the complete view and thus hypothesize the existence of perfect markets. And in perfect markets clever entrepreneurs like Jim Ratcliffe collectively make the right decisions. Everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds in this world view – earlier mocked by Voltaire’s in the philosophy of his character Dr Pangloss.  The problem with this view is that when you give people the idea that they could be infallible then, after a run of luck, they start overesstimating themselves, ignore their critics and set themselves and other people up for some disastrous mistakes. This is the hubris story by the way – the ones that the leaders of BP set themselves up for. </P><H2>Groupthink – why corporate leaders and politicans ignore evidence once they have made up their minds</H2><P>Managers spend their time trying to work out how to develop their business, and how to survive in a competitive market, are of course aware that they must devote some of their attention to health and safety and environmental issues. What a shame then that devoting attention to such matters competes for their time with many other things to be resolved and strategies that need to be worked on. Of course business strategies must embrace as much information as possible – but once you are embarked on a strategy, and above all, once you have made the public declarations and started to raise and commit millions in investment, then you cannot easily change your mind. You cannot keep chopping and changing. This is even more the case if you have borrowed a lot of money to advance  your strategy. For your own psychological peace of mind too it will not do to start doubting decisions that involve a lot of money, a lot of creditors. These decisions also underpin your relationships with your management team who are pursuing the same plan, not to mention your relationships with the rest of the workforce. </P><P>Academics, activists can chop and change and try to get to the bottom of things – but for the captains of industry there are powerful pressures to retain their focus even if real life reveals a host of issues that they did not know at first – indeed that could not know at first. That’s why, as they plough ahead with their business strategies, the temptation must sometimes be to pull down blinkers.  The more that you have at stake and already committed the greater the psychological pressure to refuse to acknowledge inconvenient new information that is telling you a mistake has been made.</P><P>In this regard one of the psychological insights of Kahneman is that decision makers who are trapped start gambling. When all options seembad the attempt to escape seems to justify taking great risks that would otherwise not be taken. In current circumstances <mark>Ineos</mark> operations in Europe are trapped by high energy and feedstock costs and the shale gas “solution” to their problems is a big commitment of resources that is a gamble to try to break themselves free and restore their ability to compete internationally. The relevant insight from this is that they are likely to want to play this all the way through, despite the low chances of success because there are no other options. In this situation, their willingness of accepting any new information about health and environment risks to anyone else might be reduced.</P><P>The ability to sustain gambles like this will be buttressed when supported by a wider network of interests.  A vested interest coalition is involved too. The larger group has also refused to review its earlier decisions and to admit that they were wrong too or to take in new information. The prospect of losing credibility and making a humiliating U turn is very offputting. Politicians, many engineering and geologist academics, as well as specialist officials often have long standing collegiate relationships. It is not surprising that this wider circle are still trotting out the message from the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering.  <mark>Ineos</mark> PR use the Royal Academy and RAE’s report as well as a very partial report by Public Health England on the limited topic of “fracking emissions”. However these were written very early and before most of the peer reviewed academic articles about public health, environmental and <mark>climate</mark> concerns started flooding  out of other departments of the universities. The later studies have not matched up with the earlier group think that geologists and engineers had said about safety. However these earlier reports by specialist academics writing partly out of their subject areas have given the cover thatis still cited as evidence for the faith that holds the frackers together. These reports still “prove” safety and they are clearly too complacent. They are still too focused on what geologists assume might be the problems – deep underground, underplaying a host of problems on the surface, issues of scale and wider gas field development, in addition to a long standing problem of well integrity. This has made it necessary for anti fracking campaigners to fight an arrogant group think that is now very dangerous.</P><P>It is thus interesting to compare what is happening with what happened earlier in the organisation that embraced the empty rhetoric of “Beyond Petroleum” under the leadership of CEO John Browne and then of Tony Hayward. According to Johan Sachs</P><P><EM>“As John Browne rose to the zenith of his global esteem, groupthink descended upon BP’s core leadership team like a thick fog. Red flags about safety concerns flew everywhere in the form of external and internal investigations and even massive government fines. Browne and his men, including Hawyard, optimistically responded with superficial fixes, believing their measures could address deeper safety issues while keeping oil flowing at maximum rates. Whistleblowers tried desperately to get executives to maintain safety equipment  and top talent resigned in protest when they did. When Hayward took over, the leadership team spent countless hours discussing plans to reorient its approach to safety even as they increased the riskiness of the projects that they undertook. From the inside, it all looked perfectly normal.”</EM> (Johan Sachs “Winning the Story Wars” <EM>Harvard Business Review Press</EM>, 2012 p221 )</P><P>Cohesive groups with a strong leader will often ignore or punish dissenting opinions. They can do it too because they have the backing of government and are given cover by frackademics and are able to play fast and loose with reality. In fact in the media and in their PR they create a fantasy world for everyone else that suits them.  There are psychological mechanisms available to keep the deeper and threatening reality out of the centre of their consciousness. Freud called it “Verdraengung” which means pushing an idea or truth away, not bringing it into the centre of conscioussness to get an appropriate amount of attention. (Verdraengung is usually wrongly translated as “repressing” in psychoanalytical literature). Yet when Ratcliffe tells a major national newspaper that the opposition to fracking is based on hearsay there is probably some dim level at which he is uneasily aware that what he is saying can be challenged. Is he unaware that the US company with which he has a 15 year contract for the supply shale gas, Range Resource, has been accused of causing a number of environmental incidents? It seems implausible that he does not know that Range Resource have paid nearly $15 million in <mark>pollution</mark> fines in recent years.  This included an $8.9 million fine which was the biggest ever for a shale gas drilling related environmental violation in Pennsylvania as well as a $4.15 million fine for violations at 6 waste water impoundments[1].</P><P>So what is going on in the mind of Ratcliffe when he claims that opposition to fracking is based on hearsay?  Is he not aware that one reason that more information and evidence against fracking does not exist are the gagging orders imposed on victims after financial settlements? In August 2013 this included a gagging order on 2 children by his partner Range Resource – the children were <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/05/children-ban-talking-about-fracking"">banned from talking about fracking for the rest of their lives</A>.</P><P>Is Ratcliffe really unaware of these things? He ought to be sensitised to issues of children’s health because in Ohio in 2009 his company was obliged to share a $1.3 million fine for multiple violations at the <mark>Ineos</mark> chemical facility at Addyston. It was a case associated with hazardous air pollutants like acrylontrile, butadiene and styrene and an elementary school had to be relocated because of the air <mark>pollution</mark> risk to school children.</P><H2>Instrumentalising children’s health to pursue a corporate agenda that will damage children’s health</H2><P>At the time of writing Ratcliffe is sponsoring long distance running by schoolchildren in a Go Run for Fun initiative. Ratcliffe is a keen long distance runner but if he and his company were keen on public health they would not be accusing opponents of fracking of basing themselves on hearsay. The dangers are well documented. It is not rumour or hearsay that 40 of 46 peer reviewed scientific studies between 2009 and 2015 show actual or potential negative effects to air quality. It is unlikely to help children’s health to run through an <mark>Ineos</mark> gasfield.  </P><P>The effect of fracking derived air <mark>pollution</mark> on the health of pregnant women and their babies should give him cause for concern too. In June of 2015 a peer reviewed University of Pittsburgh study linked fracking to low birthweight in three heavily drilled Pennsylvania counties. The more wells, and the closer the wells to where the pregnant mother lived, the greater the risk. The study did not investigate mechanisms but is authors thought air <mark>pollution</mark> was the likely route of exposure – as evidenced by another West Pennsylvania study.[2]</P><P>So what kind of person and company is it that appears to champion the health of children while simultaneously making partnerships with companies that gag children and while promoting an industry that is a threat to their health? What kind of corporate ethics are we dealing with that  denies the evidence, claims opposition is based on hearsay and spends a vast amount on corporate propaganda?</P><H2>Plastic <mark>Pollution</mark> – ethical bankrupcy is worse than financial bankrupcy</H2><P>It is not only that if <mark>Ineos</mark> goes ahead it will impose a host of public health and environmental risks on local communities and on the <mark>climate</mark> system. It is also that the products that they intend to make with the ethane and methane that they want to extract would be disastrous too. For example they want to make plastic with it. As they are in the plastic business they must know that plastic is not the innocent stuff that most people unwittingly think of it as being.</P><P>Far worse than bankruptcy would be to go down in history as having produced a stream of toxins that play a significant role in destroying the global ecological system. It is one of the boasts of <mark>Ineos</mark> that it is the third largest player among the global chemicals companies. This being does it not have the third largest responsibility for what is currently an unfolding ecological catastrophe whose source is oil and gas and the many chemicals and plastics made from them? True, the <mark>Ineos</mark> Bio subsidiary is developing ways of recycling municipal waste into fuel and electricity. That can be testified in their defence. However alone the stream of plastics produced by <mark>Ineos</mark> is an ecological catastrophe.</P><P>There are plenty of people who will remember a world where plastics had far fewer uses. In the living memory of millions of people it was not routinely used for wrapping food; for containers; for beverage and mineral water bottles; for shopping and other bags; for lids; for disposable cups, plates, knives forks and spoons; for straws, stirrers, balloons, party inflatables. Somehow humanity managed to survive day to day with old fashioned glass bottles, ceramics and objects that were designed to be used over and again, rather than to be thrown away. Somehow people did not notice what they were missing before technology progressed, plastic was mass produced and business empires like <mark>Ineos</mark> were developed in order produce a stream of trash.  As if <mark>climate change</mark> were not bad enough we now have in plastic <mark>pollution</mark> another slowly evolving disaster. That’s because plastic may break up in the environment into smaller and smaller bits, but it mostly does not break down, it does not bio-degrade. Without major logistical efforts backed by tight environmental standards it has accumulated in the environment in larger quantities and in smaller and smaller pieces. According to <A href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111913"">one recent estimate</A> there are more than 5 trillion plastic pieces weighing over 250,000 tons afloat at sea. </P><P><A href=""http://www.oceanconservancy.org/our-work/marine-debris/science-paper-executive.pdf"">This is not hearsay either</A>. </P><P>The amount of plastic waste entering the oceans from land each year exceeds 4.8 million tons (Mt), and the figure may be as high as 12.7 Mt . This is nearly one to three orders of magnitude greater than the reported mass of plastic in high-concentration ocean gyres which are slowly turning marine collection points for garbage the size of western europe. The amount is growing rapidly – with the potential to be 250 Mt by 2025. </P><P>Impacts by plastic debris on more than 660 species have been documented, including from entanglement and ingestion. Species impacted range from the smallest of zooplankton to the largest whales, including fish destined to the seafood market.  Plastics can concentrate toxic chemicals from seawater up to 1 million fold. Ingestion of these contaminated plastic particles may deliver these chemicals to the ocean animals which eat them, potentially resulting in negative effects on their health and survival.</P><P>The problem is not just in the oceans – <A href=""http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environmental-audit-committee/news-parliament-2015/environmental-impact-microplastics-evidence-2-15-16/"">but also the atmosphere</A>. It was recently reported in a House of Commons Committee how, when plastics go through sewerage treatment works, much of the smaller pieces end in sludge that goes onto fields.  When it dries out it is swept up by the windinto the atmosphere. <A href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/plastic-microplastic-microbeads-<mark>pollution</mark>-toxic-environment-house-of-commons-environmental-audit-a7011256.html"">At that point we breathe it in – in addition to eating it in foodstuffs like fish.</A></P><P>This prompts the question: how do <mark>Ineos</mark> and Ratcliffe see progress? How is this ecological disaster compatible with it? He wants economic growth and more of this. When he offers the regeneration of the north of Britain if only he can get another fix of cheap energy and more ethane feedstock what he is effectively wanting is to hang onto a share of the plastic market. He wants to be a boss of a corporation that wants to remain a global player in the production of this torrent of production. But is it not also a torrent of poisonous garbage?
Of course, we cannot know what is in the mind of a man like this, or the minds of his managers and partners. We can only speculate that  he will be thinking mainly in market and money terms. “The market for plastic” is economics-think, in which a product and a value stream is what is being thought about. The focus is on how to make a product that people want and thus to be fully entitled to make money as a reward for entreprenerial zeal and risking money. In the perception of the corporate bosses all this stuff is packaging and containers and the plastic is created to be embedded in products that people are prepared to pay for – or to package these products. This is what usually gets their attention. This is what happens between their ears. This is the thing that they know about.  The products have monetary value, people are prepared to pay, and this is their business. </P><P>But how much do such captains of industry think about what happens when the stuff that they produce is thrown away?  Yes, there is clearly thought given to the topic of what money can be made out of processing garbage. We know this because of the <mark>Ineos</mark> development of waste to energy and electricity technologies. However, what about the rest of the stream of garbage?  Is this not also their problem? It is certainly a problem for everyone else, and it is a problem that will not now go away for hundreds of years. In these hundreds of years those who live long enough to learn about what happened to their world will know may become aware of the name of Mr Ratcliffe as one of the people who organised the huge stream of plastic. One of the business moguls  whose products led to the eco-cide of the oceans.</P><H2>Championing the ‘Green Economy’ – to head off the real solutions that would make your company lose</H2><P>A lot of people don’t notice – but when corporations respond to environmental problems with which they are associated they often fund or support “solutions” which direct the action for dealing with it away from themselves. Someone else become the people or institutions that are responsible and these others have to deal with it. “Beyond Petroleum”, BP, gives another example of this. When it was clear that something was going to have to be done about <mark>climate change</mark> and <mark>carbon</mark> emissions then companies like BP  under Lord Browne moved to co-opt the policy design process. For a long time, the major fossil fuel suppliers had resisted any restraint on emissions but, at the end of the 1990s, some of them changed tack. </P><P>BP first experimented with an internal emissions trading scheme which was started in 1999. In 2002, the BP model was scaled up with the support of the UK government’s Department of the Environment and 34 other voluntarily participating companies. This UK scheme, in turn, became a model for the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme.  So far so predictable. But what was the defining characteristic of the BP scheme? If it had been a serious attempt to throttle back the supply and burning of fossil fuels it would have attempted to keep the <mark>carbon</mark> in the ground. It would have been directed at the suppliers themselves. Instead the scheme was designed around the demand. It was focused on uses and users of fossil fuels and those who bought them. It very successfully batted the solutions away from the fossil companies who were originating the problem. When the European Emissions Trading Scheme was introduced it was large companies that bought and used fossil fuels and emitted <mark>CO2</mark> during their operations, that were expected to buy permits. It was not the companies producing the coal, oil and gas who were expected to buy permits to sell fossil fuels in the first place. If it had been the latter it could have covered all fossil fuel based emissions. But that was something that neither BP nor the other suppliers wanted to see.  They designed the scheme and wrecked it. </P><P>Now <mark>Ineos</mark> Bio is seeking to find a market by reusing plastics and waste. But the <mark>Ineos</mark> group is not seeking to restrain its production in the first place. From a profit making point of view an ideal solution is to produce a stream of trash and then make money by the need to deal with part of that same trash stream. Of course, if <mark>Ineos</mark> were promoting a system where no new plastics were allowed to be produced but only existing plastics could be re-used to make them then it would be commendable. But that’s not what they are proposing and recycling alone, without further measures to throttle the flow, at source  will not adequately cope with the <mark>pollution</mark> stream. Like all corporate juggernauts <mark>Ineos</mark> wants to “grow” its markets and its production. That’s why the solution to plastic <mark>pollution</mark> may indeed involve some recyling and re-use but it has to be set in the context of reducing production. As <A href=""http://upstreampolicy.org/the-solution-to-plastic-<mark>pollution</mark>/"">one policy group have argued</A>: </P><P><EM>“The reality is that the only sound strategies to stop plastic <mark>pollution</mark> are ones that prevent it in the first place. To use the bathtub analogy, in order to stop the tub from over-flowing, we can either try to make the tub drain faster, or we can just shut off the tap.”</EM></P><P>That means a raft of policies – and a good place to start is to fight the further development of shale gas in the UK in order to stop it being used as feedstock for plastics and as a fuel source.</P><H2>In conclusion – the myth of cheap energy and revived industrialism </H2><P>Let’s return to the story that Jim Ratcliffe would like to believe and wants us to believe. This is that cheap energy will return northern Britain to its industrial heritage. It will resurrect former mining communities and other industries too. It will help us develop the new industries of the future based on science – like plastics.</P><P>To many people this will seem a curiously antiquated view of the scientific and industrial future – it only rings true if you stubbornly refuse to look at a lot of evidence that the world has long ago evolved in another direction.  Is Ratcliffe still thinking like an ambitious 1960s Grammar School boy who has just completed his science A levels? Does he still believe in “the white heat of the technological revolution”, which is how Harold Wilson, the Labour Prime Minister of the 1960s and early 1970s hyped the times he lived in?
Unfortunately there is now a mountain of evidence that fracking is deeply destructive to health and the environment. Ratcliffe wants to see that as “hearsay”. </P><P>There is also a mountain of evidence that says that the products of his company and of the petro-chemical industry in general, products like plastics, are a profound threat and must be dramatically reduced at source. Ratcliffe sees this situation when there’s a business opportunity in it for him – by selling the ability to recycling some of the tide of trash as a recycled energy source.  But is he aware that much more is needed to cope with it?</P><P>There is now too a mountain of evidence that the trend to rising extraction costs for fossil fuels is inevitable. Fracking is a more expensive way of extracting oil and gas than from conventional wells because you have to do a lot more engineering activity to release it from an impervious geological strata. It is true that there is currently a very low oil and gas price because a debt laden economy, an economy still dominated by ageing baby boomers, cannot afford to pay for expensive oil and gas or for the products made from this expensively produced oil and gas. This contradiction is creating yawning holes in the profit and loss accounts and balance sheets of the oil and gas companies, as well as in the accounts of the financiers that have lent to them. Yet Ratcliffe, like the political elite schooled at Eton and Oxford, appears to be unable to see the writing on the wall. </P><P>At the core of the Ratcliffe message is the idea of fracking giving us cheap energy. But fracking does not give cheap energy. It is not cheap to the people whose health it damages. It is not financially cheap either.  That’s why Ratcliffe is selling what appears to be a fantasy. Sure, unconventional gas extracted in the UK would not carry the same size of burden of having to pay for the military and security expenses, as well as the lavish corruption, of a variety of oil despotisms – the places where some conventional sources of oil and gas are extracted. But the extraction costs of fracked unconventional wells are higher than extraction costs for conventional wells. That’s why, to break even, unconventionally sourced gas has to be sold at a higher price too. For the <mark>Ineos</mark> gamble to pay off it is necessary that shale in the UK would be as cheap as in the very best Pennsylvania sweet spots. There is no guarantee for this and it is likely to be wishful thinking.</P><P>There is, in fact, a Catch 22 in the heart of the <mark>Ineos</mark> regeneration fairy tale. The economic system has been built on cheap energy but it is now faced with ever rising costs of energy extraction which require higher prices for the energy companies to break even. In order to pay their rising energy bills people and companies have to economise somewhere else. They struggle to service their debts too. Rising energy prices crash the economy. They destabilise the finance sector.  This puts a ceiling on how high energy prices can be and the break even point for the oil and gas companies is above that ceiling. </P><P>Fracking has not solved this dilemma and neither will Ratcliffe or <mark>Ineos</mark>. There is virtually nowhere in the world where fracking has ever made a profit over the longer term. If it comes off at all the cheap energy that Ratcliffe champions would lead, in a just a few years, to an indebted and then bankrupt exploration and production sector.  The fracking road show has kept going in the USA for as long as it has only because central banks have kept interest rates down to virtually zero. There have been few other opportunities to invest in the production economy and, as the financial papers describe it, those who “hunt for yield” have gambled their money by investing in shale.  Now that mountain of debt accumulated by the fracking industry can no longer be serviced and repaid, Ponzi-style, with more borrowing. It’s the end of the road.</P><P>This is a Catch 22 Ratcliffe and the other petrochemical companies will not be able to solve. The cheap energy and re-industrialisation idea that Ratcliffe is promoting is a mirage, a fantasy, that would lead to a mountain of debt and a mountain of garbage.  It will inevitably collapse. We can already see the signs of a global deflationary crisis as a result of crippling debts and sagging markets. The direction of the future is solving the problem of how to make do with less. Instead of growing the economy will have to mature – or it will collapse. You do people a favour not by producing more of anything, and certainly not more plastic wastes to poison the environment – but by setting up institutions to help them save energy, materials and money. Such institutions will help people to share more, make do, mend and get their satisfactions and pleasures without the aid of ecocidal empires built on trash. </P><H2>Endnotes</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Of the 61 facilities, 11 of the cellulosic ethanol facilities are operational (5 at commercial scale), and 12 of the drop-in biofuels facilities were operational (2 at commercial scale) at the end of 2015.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Cellulosic Ethanol Facilities</STRONG></P><P>At cellulosic facilities, the feedstocks range from crop residues (primarily corn stover, but also rice and oat hulls), corn kernel cellulose, woody biomass and dedicated bioenergy crops.  The cellulosic ethanol facilities operating at commercial scale include DuPont of Nevada, Iowa (crop residues), POET of Emmetsburg, Iowa (crop residues), and Quad County Corn of Galva, Iowa (crop residues).</P><P><mark>INEOS</mark> New Plant Bioenergy of Vero Beach, Florida (municipal solid waste), expects to be operational this year. <mark>INEOS</mark> was previously operational, but has been working through mechanical upgrades.   Many others expect to be operational in 2017.  Most of the existing and planned cellulosic facilities are using a biochemical pathway to produce ethanol; biochemical pathways use fermentation and the addition of enzymes to produce ethanol.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Drop-In Fuel Facilities</STRONG></P><P>Drop-in fuel producers are utilizing feedstocks from vegetable oil (such as soy or corn oil); fats waste oils and greases (from animal processing, food waste); woody biomass; and municipal solid waste.  These fuels are referred to as “drop-in” because they are chemically equivalent to petroleum fuels, and do not require engine or infrastructure changes. In 2015, 167 million gallons of drop-in fuels were produced, primarily from AltAir Fuels, of Los Angeles California (vegetable oils, fats, greases), and Diamond Green Diesel of Norco, Louisiana (vegetable oils, fats, greases).</P><P>New facilities are coming on-line with one drop-in facility expecting to be operational in 2016, and four in 2017. They include Cool Planet Energy Systems of Alexandria, Louisiana; Emerald Biofuels, of Plaquemine, Louisiana; Fulcrum BioEnergy of Reno, Nevada; and KiOR, of Columbus, Missouri.  The operational or planned drop-in facilities use either hydrotreating or thermochemical processes. Hydrotreating is a process that is commonly used in the petroleum refining industry; and thermochemical processes use oxygen-deprived, high heat environments to convert feedstocks to fuels. </P><P>Despite the aura of “phantom fuels” surrounding cellulosic and drop-in fuels, the commercial investments in these facilities shows that the advanced biofuels industry is nascent, but growing.  Investors note that stable U.S. policy is critical.  Since the EPA proposed lowering the volume of renewable fuels in 2013, no commercial-scale cellulosic facility has been planned in the United States. New investments by the cellulosic industry are currently being made in China, Europe, and Brazil.   </P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
