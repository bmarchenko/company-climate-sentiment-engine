The goal was to encourage industry – and consumers – to use products that can be made with less harm to the environment. </P><P>To get there, the state capped the total tons of emissions allowed in a given year and then required companies to buy permits for the right to pollute.</P><P>But rather than put all those permits up for sale, the state decided to give some of them away based on each industry’s historic emission levels. This was done in part to soften the blow on the big electric utilities, which emit huge amounts of <mark>carbon</mark> and would have had to hike their rates to pay for their permits, potentially causing a consumer backlash.</P><P>That decision, however, also put the state in the tricky business of deciding who would get the free “allowances,” and how many each company would receive.</P><P>Which brings us back to toilet paper. In deciding on <mark>carbon</mark> allowances, the Air Resources Board set a benchmark based on the most efficient producer in each industrial sector. If another company creates more greenhouse gas per unit of the same product, it has to buy more allowances – effectively a financial penalty for producers of more <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>But only two companies make toilet paper in California. So the state’s process was likely to create one winner and one loser. And that’s exactly what happened.</P><P>At first, the ARB set the <mark>carbon</mark> benchmark based on the mill that created the fewest greenhouse gases, which seems straightforward. That calculation favored Kimberly-Clark, which produces toilet paper and other tissue products in Fullerton.</P><P>But the other toilet paper company – Procter &amp; Gamble – complained that the decision failed to account for the superior quality of its tissue, which it makes in Oxnard. The company said its paper was so different that it should be considered a unique product and given its own <mark>carbon</mark> benchmark.</P><P>The state tried to split the difference. First the ARB separated toilet paper from other tissues – like facial tissues and paper towels. Then it recalculated its benchmark for toilet paper to adjust for “water absorbency” – the trait Procter &amp; Gamble said made its paper so special. That change made Kimberly-Clark’s Fullerton factory look like the bigger <mark>carbon</mark> hog.</P><P>Now Kimberly-Clark is crying foul, arguing that the ARB’s decision to consider water absorbency was “without scientific basis” and will make its Fullerton plant less competitive. The company continues to look for a way to overturn the ruling.</P><P>A different approach – a <mark>carbon</mark> tax or a permit sale with no free allowances – would have been far simpler, and wouldn’t have required such fine distinctions. But neither of those approaches was politically feasible. </P><P>So this is where we are today, with state officials sticking their noses in our bathrooms, studying the relative fluff and absorbency of toilet paper and assessing the damage each kind of tissue does to the environment.</P><P>Maybe the real answer is to use bidets instead.</P><DIV class=""ng_endnote_contact""><P>Daniel Weintraub is editor of the California Health Report.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

On June 20th, as he turned 59, the chief executive of Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) for the past three years gave a faltering and apologetic speech at a conference there hosted by Deutsche Bank, in which he predicted lower-than-expected profits in the coming quarter for the world's largest maker of household and personal-care products, and confessed to deep-seated problems at his firm both in <mark>innovation</mark> and the broader execution of its strategy.</P><P>The same day, at the Rio+20 Summit in Brazil, Paul Polman, a former colleague of Mr McDonald's at P&amp;G and now boss of Unilever, a big European rival, was on a high. With his firm's share price close to record levels, he was able to enjoy hobnobbing with world leaders as he called on other companies to join Unilever in adopting a range of strategies designed to tackle <mark>climate change</mark>. How Mr McDonald must have wished he were in Rio de Janeiro, too, not least because he shares Mr Polman's fondness for talking about his firm's similar “purpose-driven” goal of creating a better, more <mark>sustainable</mark> world. Instead, in Paris, as P&amp;G's share price tumbled, doubts were being raised about the sustainability of Mr McDonald's hold on his job.</P><ASIDE class=""main-content-container""><DIV class=""secondary-header grey-header size-compact"">In this section</DIV><DIV class=""bottom-links""><A href=""/rights"">Reprints</A></DIV></ASIDE><P>The sense that Unilever is on the up, whereas P&amp;G is in trouble, is the latest swing of a pendulum that only five years ago saw Unilever struggling as P&amp;G soared. The slow economic recovery in America and the deteriorating economic situation in Europe have hit P&amp;G harder, because it earns a greater share of its revenues in those developed markets and its brands tend to be more expensive than Unilever's—and thus more likely to be sacrificed by consumers who are being forced to count the pennies.</P><P>Mr McDonald's promise to make P&amp;G's pricing more competitive, and his plan to cut costs by $10 billion, could, if delivered, help to restore P&amp;G's fortunes in these markets at the expense of Unilever and other consumer-goods firms. But the biggest questions concern how P&amp;G can improve its performance in the developing economies on which both it and Unilever depend for long-term growth.</P><P><STRONG>Hoping to clean up</STRONG></P><P>Both firms started this decade by setting themselves ambitious goals. P&amp;G's was to add 1 billion new customers by 2015, a 25% increase. Unilever's was to double its revenues by 2020, at the same time as halving its negative impact on the environment, under its “<mark>sustainable</mark> living plan”. Both firms made clear that growth in emerging markets would be crucial to achieving those goals. They promised to invest heavily in distributing and marketing their established products in developing countries and in creating new ones tailored to the tastes and pockets of poorer consumers at the “bottom of the pyramid”—where, according to the late C.K. Prahalad, a management guru, a fortune lies.</P><P>P&amp;G expects developing markets to contribute 37% of its total revenues this year, up from 34% in 2010 (and 23% in 2005). For Unilever, the share from developing markets is already up to 56% of sales, from 53% in 2010. However, in absolute terms Unilever's sales in these markets, at $22.9 billion, are just behind P&amp;G's, at $23.6 billion, since P&amp;G is far bigger in developed markets (see chart).</P><P>By 2020 Unilever expects developing markets to account for 70% of total sales, with about two-thirds of that coming from growth in the overall size of those markets and the other third from an increase in Unilever's share of those expanding markets.</P><P>Exactly what share P&amp;G is aiming for in the coming years is now unclear. A year ago it talked of detailed plans to enter, by 2016, up to 950 product markets (counting each product in each distribution channel in each country as a separate market). As Ali Dibadj of Sanford C. Bernstein, an investment bank, puts it, this meant “taking on every competitor in every category in every region of the world at once.” In Paris, however, Mr McDonald described a much narrower strategy of focusing on P&amp;G's ten biggest development markets as well as, worldwide, its 40 most profitable products and 20 biggest <mark>innovation</mark>s.</P><P>Mr Dibadj says the “arrogance” of P&amp;G had caused it to underestimate the competition in emerging markets, not just from traditional rivals like Unilever but from local firms, some of which are fast becoming as professional as any multinational company from a rich country. As a result P&amp;G underestimated the cost of building its presence in these countries, he says. In its efforts to find cash to finance its emerging-market expansion, P&amp;G pushed up its prices in rich countries to levels that consumers were not ready to accept, speculates Mr Dibadj, who prefers P&amp;G's new strategy of freeing up funds by taking an axe to its bloated cost structure. Overheads are higher as a proportion of revenues than at most of its rivals, and have not fallen as sales have grown, suggesting that management has done a lousy job of achieving economies of scale. Big acquisitions, such as that of Gillette in 2005, have added products and complexity but not, it seems, efficiency.</P><P><STRONG>Cracking China</STRONG></P><P>In the developing world, P&amp;G is strongest in China, now its second-biggest national market with around 6% of the firm's worldwide sales. Yet this is a country where price competition is especially fierce. (It also has a severe shortage of talent: Unilever had over 30,000 local applicants for 100 places on its management-trainee scheme in mainland China, but thought only 80 of them good enough.) A sophisticated population of internet users makes it easier to promote new brands cheaply through digital marketing. Unilever designed a Lipton Tea-branded new year's message to send to friends that was used by 130m Chinese, for example.</P><P>Unilever is a challenger in China, but is far stronger than P&amp;G in India, where it has long been considered a local company (likewise in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka). It is still known there as Hindustan Unilever, a reference to the decades its local subsidiary spent as an essentially independent company before its fuller integration into the global firm in recent years.</P><P>Unilever benefits from India's continued reliance on small family shops (compared with the supermarkets prevalent in China), with which it has long-established relationships, and from India's far larger bottom-of-the-pyramid population. Both these factors push up the cost to a new entrant of building a distribution network. Africa, the next frontier for branded consumer goods, poses similar challenges, with both firms starting mostly in similarly weak positions.</P><P>With internet penetration relatively low in India, consumers often have to be engaged in person. P&amp;G is going into Indian schools (with government approval) to preach to girls the benefits of sanitary towels. It and Unilever have programmes to explain the health benefits of washing hands with soap several times a day and of brushing teeth regularly. But P&amp;G has nothing to equal Unilever's army of around 50,000 “<EM class=""Italic"">shakti</EM> women” who sell its products in remote villages (and which has recently been expanded to include “<EM class=""Italic"">shakti</EM> men” hired by their wives). P&amp;G's big push in India over the past couple of years was hugely expensive, including launching a price war between Tide, its venerable detergent brand, and rivals such as Unilever's Surf and Rin. Some say it temporarily pushed the company's business there into the red.</P><P>Both firms are trying to “straddle the pyramid” by offering products in each category aimed at three different sorts of consumer: high-end ones, who have essentially the same tastes as their counterparts in America or Europe; the rapidly emerging middle class, where the challenge is primarily to get shoppers to devote more of their spending to branded goods; and those at the bottom, who may never have brought any branded product before.</P><P>P&amp;G is reckoned to have been slower at “reverse engineering” its products to be affordable to poorer customers: ie, starting with the price the customer can pay, then working out how to deliver a product profitably. Unilever started doing this years ago, by selling shampoo in small sachets as well as in pricier bottles. In Indonesia, one-third of Unilever's revenue comes from purchases costing 20 US cents or less.</P><P>However, P&amp;G is beginning to work out what these extremely demanding customers want. Its Olay shampoo is now sold in sachets. In India, P&amp;G has launched Guard, a cheap new razor which, because customer research suggested it is likely to be used just once a week, comes with a comb in front of the blade to make the shave smoother.</P><P><STRONG>Cincinnati central</STRONG></P><P>P&amp;G is one of the world's most thoroughly integrated multinationals, whereas Unilever has only recently been reintegrated from a clutch of regional fiefs and continues to have two headquarters, in London and Rotterdam. This may have helped the Anglo-Dutch firm strike a better balance of global and local in developing markets compared with Cincinnati-centralised P&amp;G. Even so, both face threats from agile local firms. “Decisions on how to innovate, say, [Unilever's] Lux brand will be made by the global head of Lux, who will try to satisfy many different markets at once, which can marginalise some markets as well as being slow and bureaucratic,” says Vivek Gambhir of Godrej, an Indian consumer-goods firm. “We can get <mark>innovation</mark> done much faster, in three or four months.” The lower profit margins available in developing markets may have discouraged P&amp;G's brand managers from expanding in them, until they were ordered to do so, by which time they were playing catch-up, says Bernstein's Mr Dibadj.</P><P><STRONG>Soups, soaps and science</STRONG></P><P>Whereas both firms have <mark>innovation</mark> centres around the world, P&amp;G's Cincinnati focus may have made it less effective than Unilever at “distributed <mark>innovation</mark>”. Consumers in Britain, continental Europe and Turkey have embraced Knorr Stock Pot, a bouillon jelly developed for Chinese consumers, who disliked existing packaged soup. Likewise, Clear, an anti-dandruff shampoo designed for China, where hair is thick, black and infrequently washed, is now being rolled out in America.</P><P>Starting in 2010, Unilever has launched Dove For Men soaps simultaneously in more than 20 countries, including Brazil, “far more efficiently than it would have done in the past”, says Martin Deboo, an analyst at Investec. He attributes this to Mr Polman's focus on “better execution” since taking charge in 2009, a goal Mr McDonald embraced in Paris. In consumer goods, “strategy is only 10%; 90% of success is down to execution,” Mr Polman has said.</P><P>These are still early days for both firms in the developing markets, which unlike rich countries may have many decades of high growth ahead of them. For now, Unilever may be doing better, but elements of its developing-market growth strategy remain as unproven as whatever P&amp;G's updated strategy turns out to be.</P><P>For instance, Mr Polman sets great store by Unilever's “<mark>sustainable</mark> living plan”, not as corporate social responsibility but as a way to generate better <mark>innovation</mark>, not least by forcing its product developers to focus on using energy and water efficiently. In Asia it has launched Comfort One Rinse, designed to reduce the amount of water used when washing clothes. Purpose-driven P&amp;G has introduced a similar product, Downy Single Rinse.</P><P>Yet Mr Polman readily concedes that, so far, Unilever has been “picking low-hanging fruit”, and that “a lot of what we need to do we can't do alone.” Much will depend on re-educating consumers in the rich world to use its products more sustainably, such as by taking shorter showers; or on establishing greener habits among new consumers in developing countries than those already deeply ingrained in rich countries. Behavioural economists have been consulted on how to do this. Unilever's plan to incorporate 500,000 small farmers in developing countries into its global supply chain may ultimately give it a more secure source of high-quality produce, but making this shift is hardly without risk.</P><P>P&amp;G has also begun to demonstrate that where it is willing to invest heavily in developing markets it can make inroads. This should give hope to the embattled Mr McDonald. If he can sort out his cost problem, and free up more money for marketing and <mark>innovation</mark>, especially in the developing world, P&amp;G can rediscover its mojo. The potential of those markets is so huge that there is room for both these old rivals to win.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

More than $4 million in grants and donations have flooded in since 2008, three quarters of which came in 2011 and 2012.</P><P>In one year alone, the Copenhagen Consensus Center paid Lomborg $775,000. </P><P>Lomborg is the blonde-haired political scientist, economist and “<A href=""http://www.lomborg.com/publications/the_skeptical_environmentalist/"">skeptical environmentalist</A>” who is a beacon for many <mark>climate change</mark> contrarians and so-called “luke warmists” around the world.</P><P>While Lomborg accepts the fact that human emissions of greenhouse gases cause <mark>climate change</mark>, he argues the net economic impacts will not turn negative for more than 50 years.</P><P>If the world is to spend big money combating <mark>climate change</mark>, it should do it by “making green energy cheaper”.</P><P>His stated aim is fighting global poverty and he frequently argues that deploying renewable energy generation and cutting emissions should be well down any list of the world’s priorities.</P><P>Lomborg’s name regularly appears in lists of international influencers.

	The Copenhagen Consensus Project</H3><P>The headline act for Lomborg’s Copenhagen Consensus Center is to bring together a group he describes as “the world’s top economists” to prioritise spending “to do the most good in the world”.</P><P>In 2008, <A href=""http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/copenhagen-consensus-ii/outcomes"">Lomborg’s project ranked mitigating global warming at the bottom of a list of 30</A> issues.</P><P>In its latest <A href=""http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/outcome_document_updated_1105.pdf"">2012 report</A>, <mark>climate change</mark> featured three times. Ranked sixth was spending on research to improve crop yields, in 12th was research spending on geoengineering and in 17<SUP>th</SUP> place was money for “green energy” research.</P><P>When Lomborg told The Ecologist about his cash concerns, there was no mention that four years earlier his organisation had been quietly registered as a nonprofit think tank in Washington <SPAN class=""caps"">DC</SPAN>.</P><P>Documents filed with the Internal Revenue Service show that by the end of 2011, some $2 million in donations had already hit <SPAN class=""caps"">CCC</SPAN>’s <SPAN class=""caps"">US</SPAN> bank account.</P><P>Since registering as a <SPAN class=""caps"">US</SPAN>-based non-profit organisation in 2008, tax records show the Copenhagen Consensus Center has attracted $4.3 million in donations with almost half that coming in 2012, the most recent year where public records are available.</P><P>Lomborg’s compensation for his <SPAN class=""caps"">CCC</SPAN> work that year was $775,000, according to the <A href=""http://dynamodata.fdncenter.org/990_pdf_archive/261/261214521/261214521_201212_990.pdf"">tax records</A>.</P><P>So where is the money coming from and who are the people pulling the strings?</P><H3>

	He said where donors agreed, they would be identified on specific projects.

	 </DIV><DIV>
	He said: “Some donors stipulate that we are not allowed to advertise the name of the foundation or donor. Donors routinely decide to be anonymous, for a variety of reasons. Given how some parts of the blogosphere vilify Dr. Lomborg and certain research from the Center, it is something donors can understandably live without.</DIV><DIV>
	 </DIV><DIV>
	“We work with more than a hundred of the world's top economists and seven Nobel Laureates. It is the work of these people that assure the public of the quality of the output of the Copenhagen Consensus. </DIV><DIV>
	 </DIV><DIV>
	“We do not take funding from fossil fuel industry and we are explicit that no funding will have any influence on our research. This statement should be on our website - we'll add this to the new website.”</DIV><DIV>

It focused students on solving a challenge and it constrained their output to one blog post. The innovative genius behind this was Professor Mike Toffel, who teaches Environmental Management at Harvard Business School. He tells how he took his students straight to the point where they needed to begin their work: “We wasted no time debating whether <mark>climate change</mark> is real: in the scientific community, there really is no such debate anymore.&quot;</P><H3>928 innovative ways to thrive despite <mark>climate change</mark></H3><P>At <mark>Innovation</mark> Lab San Francisco, we work with HBS and can attest that for them, <mark>climate change</mark> is serious business. The students posted more than 900 well-researched and documented innovative ideas for very specific companies and organizations for the <mark>Climate Change</mark> Challenge on a <A href=""https://rctom.hbs.org/assignment/<mark>climate</mark>-change-challenge/"">blog especially created for the assignment</A>. HBS wanted to shed light on the specific links between <mark>climate change</mark> and business, so that the future leaders can plan for the new reality. After all, to ensure survival, businesses need to thrive under any conditions.</P><P>From big to small organizations, for these MBA students, the implications of a warming planet on the way companies do business are endless. One of the articles of this hackathon of ideas was about <A href=""https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/coca-cola-sugar-water-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">how <mark>climate change</mark> affects Coca-Cola</A> &quot;through three components that make up its signature product: sugar, water, and bottles.&quot; This student analyzed the implications of a warming planet in these 3 areas and gave innovative ideas on how to cope with each, ending with one regarding package, inspired on XPrize: &quot;For the long term, Coca-Cola should create a prize challenge to design the next generation, 100% biodegradable water bottle. Its size warrants this investment. It would be excellent publicity, as well.&quot;</P><P>Another student, Spencer Bradley, approached the <mark>Climate Change</mark> Impact from a completely different perspective. In a post titled &quot;<A href=""https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/opportunity-in-the-drought-aqua-capital-management-and-the-market-for-tribal-water-rights/"">Opportunity in the Drought: Aqua Capital Management and the Market for Tribal Water Rights</A>,&quot; analyzes how a company named Aqua Capital Management is building a business on managing increasingly scarce water resources in the American West. Bradley explores the hurdles posed by regulation and how this company's &quot;greatest opportunity lies in their “Tribes” business, which is based on “assisting tribes to evaluate and analyze their water rights and providing solutions to optimize their value.&quot;</P><P>If you think these students only explored the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> in obvious business areas, think again. From your shampoo to your mobile gaming host to your bowl of morning cereal, <mark>climate change</mark> poses risks and opportunities for the companies that deliver them to you. The titles of some of the 928 articles tell the story of this &quot;diversity&quot; when it comes to <mark>climate change</mark> impact: &quot;<A href=""https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/can-procter-gamble-really-improve-peoples-lives/"">Can Procter &amp; Gamble really improve people’s lives?</A>&quot; &quot;<A href=""https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/power-struggles-at-amazon-web-services/"">Power Struggles at Amazon Web Services,</A>&quot; &quot;<A href=""https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/coca-cola-sugar-water-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">Coca-Cola: Sugar, Water and <mark>Climate Change</mark></A>,&quot; &quot;<A href=""https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/the-environmental-impact-behind-a-cereal-box-how-general-mills-is-addressing-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">The environmental impact behind a cereal box: How General Mills is addressing <mark>climate change</mark></A>,&quot; and &quot;<A href=""https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/mother-of-all-risks-<mark>climate</mark>-change-and-the-u-s-armed-forces/"">Mother of All Risks’: <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the U.S. Armed Forces</A>.&quot;</P><H3>No judgments, just business</H3><P>The description of the &quot;hackathon&quot; assignment produced one of the most interesting lessons from this HBS exercise. It instructed the students to &quot;Describe how the organization is likely to be affected, the steps the organization is taking to address those effects, and describe and justify what additional steps you think the organization should consider implementing.&quot; As a result, all 928 articles focus on business, not on judging the good or bad, or on arguments leading to dead alleys such as wondering if <mark>climate change</mark> is a hoax or whether humans cause it or not. As professor Toffel indicated to his students, we're past that argument.</P><P>In addition to laser-focused papers on uncovering opportunities and threats on the subject, this challenge produced solid ideas on how not only to deal with <mark>climate change</mark> and thrive despite it, but how to mitigate it in the first place. Companies like ours, who work on technological <mark>innovation</mark>s to help business and societies thrive in a <mark>sustainable</mark> manner, can take many lessons from these HBS students. For us, we took the following three lessons, which are the principles behind the hackathons we ourselves put together for our clients:</P><UL><LI>There is no problem that can't be hacked:The business opportunity and the action for <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation can go hand-in-hand to thrive under a warming planet and slow down human effects on it;</LI><LI>Laser-focus solves the problem: Breaking the huge problem of <mark>climate change</mark> into the small chunks that different companies can directly affect by their actions produces a trove of solid ideas that can be implemented in all industries; and,</LI><LI>Teamwork produces the solution: There is no problem we can't jointly solve when we decide to work together on practical solutions without pointing fingers.</LI></UL><P>When it comes to ingenuity without judgment, which is urgently needed regarding <mark>climate change</mark>, ask the students for ideas!</P><P><EM>Photo courtesy of HBS graduate, Silicon Valley Entrepreneur, friend of <mark>Innovation</mark> Lab and photographer <A href=""http://www.christophermichel.com/"">Christopher Michel</A>.</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""ds-footer""><DIV class=""field field-name-labagents""><DIV class=""ds-1col view view-contact-person view-id-contact_person view-display-id-block view-dom-id-ebd927e2bb7faf6cadb9a3d364eb56a0 view-mode-default  clearfix""><DIV class=""views-row views-row-1 views-row-odd views-row-first views-row-last""><DIV class=""ds-2col-stacked contact-person-block-fields clearfix""><DIV class=""group-header""><DIV class=""views-field-field_call_to_action_text"">Want more info?

We take any allegation of impropriety by our suppliers very seriously.”</P><P>Popyk said Procter &amp; Gamble was committed to the <mark>sustainable</mark> sourcing of palm oil. “As part of our sustainability goals, we have committed to 100 percent <mark>sustainable</mark> sourcing of palm oil by 2015. We are working with our suppliers to ensure that we deliver this commitment.”</P><P>“The makers of Head &amp; Shoulders need to stop bringing rainforest destruction into our showers,” said Bustar Maitar, head of the Indonesian forest campaign at Greenpeace International. “Procter &amp; Gamble must clean up its act and guarantee its customers that these products are forest-friendly.</P><P>“The company should follow the lead of other palm oil using companies like Unilever, Nestlé and L’Oréal, which have already promised to clean up their supply chains.”</P><P>Greenpeace says its investigations link Procter &amp; Gamble to companies involved in the clearance of tiger and orangutan habitat, peatland destruction, forest fires, and social conflict. “Its suppliers have bases in high-risk regions of Indonesia including Riau, West and Central Kalimantan, and Papua New Guinea, as well as Sarawak in Malaysia.”</P><P>According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), palm oil plantations are the leading cause of rainforest destruction in Indonesia and Malaysia, who together produce close to 90 percent of the world supply.</P><P>One area of Indonesia that has been illegally slashed and burned is the Tripa peat forest, which lies within Sumatra’s Leuser Ecosystem – the only place on earth where tigers, elephants, rhinos, and orangutans can be found living together in the wild.</P><P style=""text-align:center;""><EM>Tripa burning in 2012; photo by Carlos Quiles.</EM></P><P>In a recent court judgment in Indonesia, one palm oil company, PT Kallista Alam, was fined millions of dollars for illegally burning large swathes of Tripa.</P><P>Experts say that the Sumatran orangutan and tiger are both on the brink of extinction. Orangutans in Borneo are also seriously endangered.</P><P style=""text-align:center;""><STRONG>Sustainability commitments</STRONG></P><P>“Progressive palm oil producers in the Palm Oil <mark>Innovation</mark> Group, along with ambitious commitments from the big palm oil players Golden-Agri Resources and Wilmar, prove that there is a business case for responsible palm oil,” said Bustar Maitar.</P><P>“There is no excuse for companies like Procter &amp; Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser, and Colgate Palmolive to delay immediate action on deforestation.”</P><P>The food manufacturing company Kellogg recently made a commitment to only buy palm oil that is fully traceable and produced in an “environmentally responsible manner”. It said its suppliers would have to meet specific sourcing criteria by 2015.</P><P>There have also been new sustainability commitments from Ferrero Chocolates and the Brussels-based food retailing company, the Delhaize Group.</P><P>These announcements have received a widespread welcome, but there are those that are calling for swifter action.</P><P>About half of the packaged food now found in supermarkets contains palm oil. It is present in all kinds of produce ranging from biscuits and peanut butter to chocolate and ice cream; it’s in all kinds of ready meals and breakfast cereals, and in shampoo, cosmetics, shaving cream, soap, and industrial lubricants.</P><P style=""text-align:left;"">Palm oil is now also being used to make biofuel, the production of which actually increases greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P style=""text-align:center;""><STRONG>Orangutan deaths</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align:left;"">In its new report, published after a year-long investigation, Greenpeace highlights the activities of the Indonesian palm oil company BW Plantation, which operates in Borneo and is a Procter &amp; Gamble supplier.</P><P>“Our investigations link BW Plantation to recent clearance of orangutan habitat. One of its operations is also linked to a police investigation of the death and burial of numerous orangutans next to the Tanjung Puting National Park, Central Kalimantan.”</P><P>In other cases, Greenpeace has documented ongoing forest clearance within the concessions of two producers known to directly supply Procter &amp; Gamble – the Malaysian multinational Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad and the Indonesian company Musim Mas, which has its headquarters in Singapore.</P><P>The forest campaigner at Greenpeace International, Areeba Hamid, says Greenpeace has been confronting Procter &amp; Gamble over the past eight months.</P><P>“Instead of taking urgent action, the company has been greenwashing its actions. It’s time Procter &amp; Gamble committed 100 percent to forest protection and stops making its customers part of the Sumatran tiger’s extinction.”</P><P>Companies without strong policies to cut deforestation from their products are exposed to illegal practices in high-risk areas like the Sumatran province of Riau, Areeba Hamid says.</P><P style=""text-align:center;""><STRONG>Destruction of tiger habitat</STRONG></P><P>Greenpeace cites the PT Rokan Adi Raya concession, where there were uncontrolled forest-clearing fires last year. The cleared land includes tiger habitat and deep peat.</P><P>Riau holds 40 percent of Indonesia’s peatland <mark>carbon</mark>, and contains about one-fifth of the remaining Sumatran tiger habitat. It is Indonesia’s largest palm-oil producing province and the haze from forest clearing in the region regularly spreads as far as neighbouring Malaysia.</P><P>Greenpeace also gives the example of the Tesso Nilo national park in Riau. The park has one of the world’s highest recorded diversities of plants and supports key populations of critically endangered Sumatran elephants and tigers.</P><P>“Encroachment by palm oil plantations into tiger conservation landscapes and protected areas continues, severely endangering the long-term health of the forest,” Greenpeace states in its new report.</P><P>“With very limited exception, encroachment is illegal – yet the harvest from these plantations has been making its way into the international palm oil trade.”</P><P>Greenpeace says that even mills certified by the Roundtable on <mark>Sustainable</mark> Palm Oil (RSPO) have been accepting third-party supplies of oil palm fresh fruit bunches that originate from highly destructive operations – in the case of Tesso Nilo, the illegal clearance of a national park and critical tiger habitat.</P><P>“Since 2011, the forest complex has lost almost half of its remaining forest cover; in June 2013, only 39,000 hectares of natural forest remained – a mere quarter of the area of the forest complex.</P><P>“In June 2013, 446 fire hotspots were recorded within the forest complex, primarily in areas that had been cleared over the 2011–2013 period. Landsat analysis from August 2013 shows 7,600 hectares covered by fire scars, ranging in size from a few hectares to several hundred hectares, with most of the larger scars inside the national park itself.”</P><P>According to a WWF field survey of more than 50,000 hectares of encroachment areas inside the Tesso Nilo forest complex in 2011, 70 percent of that land had been converted to oil palm plantations.</P><P>An investigation by WWF in 2011–2012 exposed how two international palm oil traders – Asian Agri and Wilmar – were involved in the trade of palm oil from the illegal destruction of the Tesso Nilo forest. Both companies have since stopped purchasing fruits from suppliers operating inside the park.</P><P style=""text-align:center;""><EM>Infographic by the Union of Concerned Scientists</EM></P><P>The US-based Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) says the deforestation caused by palm oil production is driving global warming. “Ten percent of all global warming emissions result from deforestation. This practice also destroys irreplaceable forests that are home to endangered species and a resource for forest-dependent communities,” said Sharon Smith, campaign manager for the UCS’s Tropical Forest &amp; <mark>Climate</mark> Initiative.</P><P>Procter &amp; Gamble products known to contain palm oil derivatives include Pampers products; detergents such as Ariel, Dash, Lenor, Ace, Tide, Dawn and Gain; Wella and Head &amp; Shoulders hair products; and Gillette and Mach 3 shaving gels.</P><P>The company’s products are available in more than 180 countries, and the company is estimated to have 4.8 billion customers worldwide.</P><P>Procter &amp; Gamble is a member of the RSPO “We support the RSPO criteria established for <mark>sustainable</mark> palm oil,” said Lisa Popyk. “Additionally, we are part of the working group on <mark>sustainable</mark> sourcing of palm oil derivatives.”</P><P>Greenpeace says the company’s submissions to the RSPO are “minimally informative” and add little that aids understanding of its commitments and targets.</P><P style=""text-align:center;""><STRONG>Demands for tougher standards</STRONG></P><P>The RSPO has itself been heavily criticised for having inadequate guidelines. Certified <mark>sustainable</mark> palm oil is not guaranteed to be deforestation-free.</P><P>Under Indonesian law, development on peat up to three meters deep is still legal, and the RSPO does not ban all development on peat.</P><P>The UCS says the RSPO standards “do not yet represent the best science regarding forest conservation and <mark>carbon</mark> emissions”.</P><P>Indonesia’s peatlands cover less than 0.1 per cent of the Earth’s surface, but their destruction is causing 4 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions every year.</P><P>According to Greenpeace, the annual clearing of Indonesia’s peatlands releases some 1.8 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases and some put the figure at 2 billion.</P><P>Indonesia’s forests are disappearing at a rate of more than nine Olympic swimming pools each minute, Greenpeace states, and palm oil is the biggest driver of forest destruction.</P><P>The scientists union has welcomed the new commitments by Kellogg and others. “Palm oil can be grown without destroying tropical forests or our <mark>climate</mark>,” said Sharon Smith. The real question, Smith said, was whether companies were moving fast enough and aggressively enough in the face of such a rapidly changing <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>Greenpeace says that the recent commitments from suppliers and consumer companies give strong indications that something is changing in the palm oil industry, and that the industry can finally move away from a bad reputation fuelled by decades of forest destruction.</P><P>It states, however, that the reaction from the rest of the industry to those instigating change is a cause for concern.</P><P>“Indonesian producers have met the progress shown by Golden-Agri Resources and Wilmar with stony silence. By contrast, the Malaysian industry is actively pushing back in the press. It claims that Wilmar’s new commitment will undermine the industry.</P><P>“Leading palm oil producers like Sime Darby, Musim Mas, and IOI need to nail their colours to the mast and make public commitments to implement no-deforestation policies.”</P><P style=""text-align:center;""><EM>Forest destruction in Sumatra; photo by Roni Bintang.</EM></P><P>Greenpeace is calling on Procter &amp; Gamble and other user companies to recognise the true costs of irresponsible palm oil production. “They need to ensure that their palm oil supply makes a genuine contribution to Indonesia’s development, rather than destroying the future for its people, its wildlife and the global <mark>climate</mark> on which we all depend.</P><P>“Procter &amp; Gamble should join other leading industry players in making an immediate commitment to implement a no-deforestation policy.”</P><P>As recently as the 1960s, 82 percent of Indonesia was covered with tropical rainforests, but the country now has one of the fastest deforestation rates in the world.</P><P><EM>A Greenpeace investigation with The Friends of the National Park (<EM>FNPI</EM>) documents an orangutan skull beside an oil palm plantation owned by PT Bumi Langgeng Perdanatrada, a subsidiary of BW Plantation Group, near Tanjung Puting National Park in Central Kalimantan.

May 10th, 2017</P><P><STRONG>Mr. President:</STRONG></P><P>We are writing to express our strong support for the United States remaining in the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement.</P><P>As CEOs of large American companies, or with significant operations in the United States, we are concerned about keeping the doors open for the global flow of American manufactured goods and products at this critical time when our Manufacturing sector is starting to grow from our competitive energy advantage.
Based on our vast experience doing business all over the world, we believe there is strong potential for negative trade implications if the United States exits from the Paris Agreement.</P><P>Our business interests are best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced response to reducing global GHG emissions. The Paris Agreement gives us that flexible framework to manage <mark>climate change</mark> while providing a smooth transition for business. We believe that American companies…and our suppliers, customers, and communities… will benefit from U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement in several ways:</P><UL><LI>It strengthens our competitiveness in global markets.</LI><LI>It benefits American manufacturing as we modernize to new, more efficient technologies.</LI><LI>It supports investment by setting clear goals which enable long-term planning.</LI><LI>It expands global and domestic markets for clean, energy-efficient technologies which will generate jobs and economic growth.</LI><LI>It encourages market-based solutions and <mark>innovation</mark> to achieve emissions reductions at low cost.</LI></UL><P>We are committed to working with you to create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness, and we believe this can be best achieved by remaining in the Paris Agreement. Let’s work together to maintain the United States’ status as the world’s biggest champion of economic growth and <mark>innovation</mark>.</P><P>We appreciate the opportunity to share our views and would welcome the opportunity to provide further input as the Administration continues to shape its policies.</P><P>Sincerely,</P><P>

In the past year, the initiative has seen a growth rate of over 2 companies per week committing to set science-based targets, far exceeding the project’s timeline and signaling that <mark>climate</mark> action has gained tremendous momentum in the private sector.</P><P>A partnership between CDP, WRI, WWF and the UN Global Compact, the Science Based Targets initiative works with companies to set ambitious emission reduction targets. Businesses who commit have two years to set science-based targets, which are then closely reviewed by the initiative’s team of experts, who only approve those that meet strict criteria. These 200 businesses represent an estimated <STRONG>USD $4.8 trillion in market value</STRONG>, comparable to the total estimated value of the Tokyo stock exchange, and are responsible for <STRONG>627 million metric tonnes of <mark>CO2</mark> equivalent emissions per year</STRONG>, roughly equal to the annual emissions of South Korea.</P><P>Of the 200 companies, 26 have had their targets approved by the initiative, including <STRONG>Coca Cola Enterprises, Dell, General Mills, Kellogg, NRG Energy, Procter &amp; Gamble, Sony, Thalys</STRONG> and other leading companies. Some of the newly approved targets include:</P><P>•<STRONG><A href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/we-mean-business/walmarts-science-based-ta_b_12800924.html"">Walmart</A></STRONG>, the world’s largest retailer and private-sector employer, commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions 18% by 2025, from 2015 levels. Walmart will also work to reduce <mark>CO2</mark>e emissions from upstream and downstream scope 3 sources by one billion tons between 2015 and 2030.</P><P>•<STRONG>Diageo plc</STRONG>, the world’s largest producer of spirits and a major producer of beer, commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and scope 2 emissions 50% by 2020. from 2007 levels. Diageo also commits to reduce its GHG emissions across the total value chain of its products by 30% within the same timeframe.</P><P>•<STRONG>Verbund AG</STRONG>, Austria’s largest electricity provider, commits to reduce GHG emissions 90% by 2021, from a 2011 base-year (scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions from fuel-and-energy related activities and business air travel). This is a milestone in the long-term goal to achieve <mark>carbon</mark> neutrality by 2050.</P><P>“Walmart is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, in alignment with the Paris Agreement in December 2015,” said <STRONG>Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart</STRONG>. “We want to make sure Walmart is a company that our associates and customers are proud of – and that we are always doing right by them and by the communities they live in. That’s really what these commitments are about. And that’s why we’re so passionate about them.”</P><P>Science-based targets are in alignment with a key goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement on <mark>climate change</mark>, which is to limit the rise of global temperatures to well below 2 degrees C . The agreement entered into force on November 4, with 110 countries representing 76% of global emissions having ratified so far.</P><P>“The momentum behind the Science Based Targets initiative proves that companies are ready, willing and able to take serious <mark>climate</mark> action,” said <STRONG>Lila Karbassi, Chief of Environment at the UN Global Compact</STRONG>. &quot;Now, with the Paris Agreement in force and the 2030 deadline for the <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals, we urgently need companies everywhere to rise to the <mark>climate</mark> challenge, set ambitious targets aligned with science and become leaders of the low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy.”</P><P>Companies setting science-based targets must seek to not only reduce emissions in their own operations, but also within their value chain. Measuring and managing these emissions spurs companies to identify reduction opportunities, collaborate with suppliers, move towards greener suppliers, improve energy efficiency of products, and rethink distribution networks. These measures can significantly reduce the overall impact on the <mark>climate</mark>, and improve the quality and value of a company’s products.</P><P>“Business action on <mark>climate</mark> is more important than ever right now. To really make a difference, however, companies must be more ambitious than they have been so far,” said <STRONG>Cynthia Cummis, WRI’s Director of Private Sector <mark>Climate</mark> Mitigation</STRONG>. “Setting greenhouse gas targets in line with science sends a strong signal to peer companies that they need to shift their business strategies to embrace a low-<mark>carbon</mark> future. It’s not just good for the planet, but also good for consumers and the bottom line.”</P><P>The 200 committed companies span 33 countries and represent a wide range of sectors, including food and beverage, pharmaceutical, automotive, and electric utilities. Companies that have made a commitment within the last six months include <STRONG>PepsiCo, HSBC Holdings, SunPower Corporation, Cisco Systems, Motorola Solutions, Mediclinic Southern Africa, Capitas Finance Limited, Legrand, Metsä Board Corporation and ADVA Optical Networking</STRONG>.</P><P>“The rapid growth of companies—quite diverse in their sectors and geographic locations—aligning their emission targets to the goals adopted in the Paris Agreement is a good sign for business and for the <mark>climate</mark>. They are setting transformative but achievable science-based targets, signaling to governments that they must also keep pace and adjust their national <mark>climate</mark> plans,” said <STRONG>Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, leader of WWF International’s <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy Practice.</STRONG></P><P>The 200th company to commit to setting a science-based target is Mediclinic Southern Africa, an international private hospital group with South African roots.</P><P>“For Mediclinic, setting a science-based target makes business sense, we already see direct benefits from emissions reduction efforts through cost savings and energy supply security,” said <STRONG>Francois Bester, the company’s environmental systems manager</STRONG>. “More than that, it is part of our business culture to take responsibility for health beyond the walls of our hospitals. We believe we have a responsibility to ensure that people live healthy lives in a healthy environment and that is why we are committed to setting a science-based emission reduction target.”</P><P>A recent report by CDP in partnership with We Mean Business found that although the large majority of companies have set targets to reduce emissions, in many cases the level of ambition and  time horizon fall short of what is needed for business to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement.</P><P>&quot;We have seen a significant increase in the number of companies committing to set science-based targets since the Paris agreement. This demonstrates that many major companies are preparing to adapt their business plans to be consistent with a two degree pathway and drive the transition to the low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy. They are making this commitment because they realize the business benefits of doing so: reducing risk, building resilience and positioning themselves to unlock great opportunities,” said <STRONG>Paul Simpson, CEO of CDP, formerly the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project</STRONG>. “We need to build on this momentum and bring the rest of the business world on board. With the private sector responsible for up to 70% of global emissions, it is critical that they act now to prevent the most dangerous effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>For more information visit: <A href=""http://sciencebasedtargets.org"">http://sciencebasedtargets.org</A>.</P></DIV><DIV class=""block block--callout""><H3 class=""block-title"">Contact</H3></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The nine activists, one of whom dressed in a tiger costume while hanging from the zipline, also unfurled two 50 ft. banners from the building with the message Head &amp; Shoulders, Stop Putting Tiger Survival on the Line and Head &amp; Shoulders, Wipes out Dandruff &amp; Rainforests.



P&amp;G is buying palm oil linked to rainforest destruction, to make everyday products like Head &amp; Shoulders and Oil of Olay, said Joao Talocchi, Greenpeace Palm Oil Campaigner. Rainforest destruction is endangering species like the Sumatran tiger and orangutan. We should be able to wash away dandruff without wiping out tigers.



Indonesia's forests are disappearing at a rate of more than nine Olympic swimming pools each minute, with palm oil being the biggest driver of that deforestation. Forest destruction in the region is pushing the Sumatran tiger and orangutan to extinction. To highlight this, Greenpeace also launched a video today, spoofing P&amp;Gs <I>Thank you, Mom</I> commercials.



P&amp;G prides itself on being innovative. Yet companies like LOreal, Nestle and Unilever have already made strong commitments to prevent dirty palm oil getting into their products, leaving P&amp;G trailing behind, said Talocchi.



Greenpeace International conducted a year-long investigation, including field trips in Indonesia, which exposed links between controversial palm oil plantations and the P&amp;G supply chain. As recently as January 2014, tropical rainforest in endangered orangutan habitat, was actively being cleared by a P&amp;G supplier, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad (KLK). Both P&amp;G and KLK are members of the Roundtable for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Palm Oil (RSPO), which has principles prohibiting this practice. To prevent this and further deforestation scandals, Greenpeace urges P&amp;G to adopt a robust no-deforestation policy for all its palm oil purchases.

Where the <ACRONYM title=""Federal Environmental Quality Guideline"">FEQG</ACRONYM> is met there is low likelihood of adverse effects on the protected use (e.g., aquatic life or the wildlife that may consume them). They are based on the toxicological effects or hazards of specific substances or groups of substances and do not take into account analytical capability or socio-economic factors. <ACRONYM title=""Federal Environmental Quality Guideline"">FEQG</ACRONYM>s serve three functions: first, they can be an aid to prevent <mark>pollution</mark> by providing targets for acceptable environmental quality; second, they can assist in evaluating the significance of concentrations of chemical substances currently found in the environment (monitoring of water, sediment, and biological tissue); and third, they can serve as performance measures of the success of risk management activities. The use of <ACRONYM title=""Federal Environmental Quality Guideline"">FEQG</ACRONYM>s is voluntary unless prescribed in permits or other regulatory tools. Thus <ACRONYM title=""Federal Environmental Quality Guideline"">FEQG</ACRONYM>s, which apply to the ambient environment, are not effluent limits or “never-to-be-exceeded” values but may be used to derive effluent limits. The development of <ACRONYM title=""Federal Environmental Quality Guideline"">FEQG</ACRONYM>s is the responsibility of the Federal Minister of Environment under the <EM>Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999</EM>. The intent is to develop <ACRONYM title=""Federal Environmental Quality Guideline"">FEQG</ACRONYM>s as an adjunct to risk assessment/risk management of priority chemicals identified in the Chemicals Management Plan (<ACRONYM title=""Chemicals Management Plan"">CMP</ACRONYM>) or other federal initiatives. This factsheet describes the Federal Water Quality Guidelines (<ACRONYM title=""Federal Water Quality Guidelines"">FWQG</ACRONYM>s) for the protection of aquatic life for alcohol ethoxylates and some related substances (see Figure 1) and is based on information obtained to 2004. No <ACRONYM title=""Federal Environmental Quality Guideline"">FEQG</ACRONYM>s have been developed for the soil, sediment or biological tissue compartments at this time.</P><P><STRONG>Federal Water Quality Guideline: 70 µg/L</STRONG>(for representative alcohol ethoxylate homologue C<SUB>13.7</SUB><ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM><SUB>5</SUB>)</P><P><STRONG>Figure 1.</STRONG> Species sensitivity distribution (<ACRONYM title=""species sensitivity distribution"">SSD</ACRONYM>) for freshwater toxicity data for the representative alcohol ethoxylate homologue C<SUB>13.7</SUB><ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM><SUB>5</SUB> and associated effect levels for freshwater life.

Alcohol ethoxylates are a class of nonionic surfactants that contain a hydrophobic alkyl chain attached via an ether linkage to a hydrophilic ethylene oxide (<ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM>) chain and have the general structure R(OCH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>)<SUB>n</SUB>OH. The alkyl chain, R, can vary in length and in the degree of linearity, but is typically between 8 and 18 <mark>carbon</mark>s long (for detergent range surfactants). The <ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM> chain can also vary in length from 1 to 40 <ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM> units. An AE with the structure C<SUB>9-11</SUB><ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM><SUB>6.5</SUB>, for example, contains a range of alkyl chain lengths of 9-11 and averages 6.5 <ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM> units per alkyl chain. It should be noted that, although this is the general description of the mixture, other homologues are present. For example, an AE produced from a C<SUB>12-15</SUB> alcohol mixture can yield up to 100 different surfactants (Raney 2000). Due to the large number of possible <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM>, many different <ACRONYM title=""Chemical Abstracts Service"">CAS</ACRONYM> numbers and trade names exist for <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> (Table 1). Because of their ecological and/or human health concerns, many of these substances were identified as priorities for further action under the <ACRONYM title=""Chemicals Management Plan"">CMP</ACRONYM>.</P><P>The hundreds of different possible <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> each have slightly different chemical and physical properties (Hennes-Morgan and De Oude 1994), however, the presence of a strong hydrophilic (ethoxylate chain) and strong hydrophobic (alkyl chain) moiety linked together gives them their characteristic surfactant properties (Swisher 1987). <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> concentrate at surfaces and interfaces in aqueous solutions and create a surface film which reduces the surface tension of water and alters the wetting properties between water and solids (Aveyard 1984; Swisher 1987). The solubility of <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> in water results from the presence of the hydrophilic group (Aveyard 1984).</P><DIV class=""alignRight""><P><A href=""#top"" title=""Return to Top of Page"">Top of Page</A></P></DIV><H2>Uses</H2><P>Alcohol ethoxylates are currently some of the most commonly manufactured and utilised nonionic surfactants in Canada and world-wide (Camford Information Services 1997; Campbell 2002). <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> are predominantly used in consumer and industrial products such as laundry detergents and all-purpose cleaners, and are used to a lesser extent by agriculture, cosmetic, textile, paper, and oil sectors (Talmage 1994; Camford Information Services 1997; Madsen et al. 2001). Total production capacity of <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> in Canada in 1996 was estimated at 72 000 t (Camford Information Services 1997). In 2000, a total of 216 800 t of <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> were consumed in Canada and the United States (Modler et al. 2002). Of this total, approximately 41% was used in laundry liquids, 20% in laundry powders, 3% in dishwashing liquids, 9% in other household cleaners, and the remaining 27% was consumed through other uses. In addition, another 411 408 t of <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> were consumed in Canada and the United States in 2000 in the production of alcohol ethoxysulfates, a group of anionic surfactants. In 2002, it is estimated that over 500 000 t of fatty alcohols and fatty-alcohol-based surfactants were consumed in North America (Modler et al. 2004). Of this, approximately 67% consisted of <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> or sulfated AE.</P><P><STRONG>Table 1.

Since the majority of <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> are used in cleaners and detergents, the largest recipient of chemical inputs is the aquatic environment, primarily through wastewater effluent as a result of consumer disposal practices (Holt et al. 1992). Other potential sources of exposure exist within the industrial sectors where <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> are manufactured or used (industrial cleaners, pulp and paper, chemical manufacture). Natural degradation processes and wastewater treatment techniques remove a large proportion of AE from water, however there is still potential for aquatic exposure. Due to the hydrophobic moiety of AE compounds, once introduced into the aquatic environment they have the potential to adsorb to particulate matter and be deposited to sediments (McAvoy and Kerr 2001). An additional pathway for environmental exposure to <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> is via direct application to soils such as in sewage sludge, and through the use of septic systems which use the soil to treat and disperse wastewater (Nielsen et al. 2002).</P><DIV class=""alignRight""><P><A href=""#top"" title=""Return to Top of Page"">Top of Page</A></P></DIV><H2>Fate, behaviour and partitioning in the environment</H2><P>By far the most significant fate process for <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> is aerobic microbial biodegradation. Due to the down-the-drain disposal pattern of <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM>, a majority of their biodegradation occurs in the sewage system (Nielsen et al. 2002), wastewater treatment plants (<ACRONYM title=""wastewater treatment plant"">WWTP</ACRONYM>) (McAvoy et al. 1998), septic systems (Matthijs et al. 1995) and to a lesser extent in natural waters (Vashon and Schwab 1982). Multibranched <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM>, which make up significantly less of the commercial AE market in Canada (Campbell 2002), are slower to degrade than linear <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> (Birch 1984; Marcomini et al. 2000) but can still be considered readily degradable. Intermediate degradation products of <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> can include free fatty alcohols, polyethylene glycols (PEG), and carboxylic fatty acids.</P><P>Adsorption of <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> plays a minor role in their aquatic fate, with sorption to humic materials in water, suspended and bed sediments, and sludge in wastewater treatment facilities. <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> are not expected to volatilize to the atmosphere (Kiewiet et al. 1997).</P><P><ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> are rapidly taken up across the gills in fish (Bishop and Maki 1980; Wakabayashi et al. 1987; Tolls et al. 1994; Newsome et al. 1995) and are rapidly metabolised and eliminated from fish (Bishop and Maki 1980; Wakabayashi et al. 1987; Newsome et al. 1995). Based on the high elimination rates, Tolls et al. (2000) concluded that rapid biotransformation was taking place in fathead minnows <EM>(Pimephales promelas)</EM>, and that <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> were not stored in the fish. Metabolites formed during biotransformation are of less concern than the parent compound as the short-chained metabolites have low lipophilicity and therefore are less toxic (Roberts 1991; Newsome et al. 1995). Bioconcentration factors reported for <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> are typically less than 300 (e.g., Tolls et al. 2000) and would not meet the criteria for <EM>Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations</EM> (Government of Canada 2000). However, log octanol/water partitioning coefficients (log <EM><ACRONYM title=""octanol: water partition coefficient"">K<SUB>ow</SUB></ACRONYM></EM>) for various <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> have been estimated to range from approximately 3 to 7, suggesting that some <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> may tend to bioaccumulate (Müller et al. 1999b).</P><DIV class=""alignRight""><P><A href=""#top"" title=""Return to Top of Page"">Top of Page</A></P></DIV><H2>Ambient concentrations</H2><P>Any <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> detected in the environment are the result of anthropogenic releases. Free fatty alcohols, however, which are found in mixtures of AE homologues, can also occur naturally. Free fatty alcohols are generally analysed with and quantified as <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM>, and may therefore result in an over estimation of AE levels. There is currently no information on ambient concentrations of <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> in the Canadian environment.</P><P>In August 2003, effluents were sampled from eight Canadian municipal <ACRONYM title=""wastewater treatment plant"">WWTP</ACRONYM> (P&amp;G – Shell 2003; Sherren et al. 2003; Eadsforth et al. 2006). The total AE concentrations for these eight plants ranged from 1.0 to 22.7 µg/L, with an average of 6.8 µg/L (Sherren et al. 2003). It is notable that the two highest concentrations occurred in effluents from the two plants that did not use activated sludge treatment. The measurements of total <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> included those species with no ethoxylate groups (i.e., free fatty alcohols). Among the eight municipal <ACRONYM title=""wastewater treatment plant"">WWTP</ACRONYM>, free alcohols accounted for 21 to 62% of the total AE concentration. Although some of this free alcohol likely resulted from the degradation of <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM>, some may also have originated from other sources including other alcohol-based surfactants such as alkyl sulfates and alcohol ethoxysulfates, other uses of alcohols, and as metabolic by-products from microbial degradation of animal and vegetable matter in the municipal <ACRONYM title=""wastewater treatment plant"">WWTP</ACRONYM> (Scott Belanger, Procter &amp; Gamble, pers. comm. 2004, Mudge et al. 2008). Ratios of the molar concentrations of free alcohol to <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> in the effluent were determined for each alkyl chain length. Using these ratios, it is therefore possible to determine “alcohol caps”, that is, maximum concentrations of free alcohol in effluents that could have originated from <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM>. The alcohol cap is defined as the ratio (for each chain length) between the effluent alcohol that could have been derived from AE and the total ethoxylated alcohols in the effluent (<ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM>&gt; 1). The cap values derived from Stephenson et al. (2004) were 0.58, 0.63, 0.33, 0.25, 0.26 and 0.05 for C<SUB>12</SUB>, C<SUB>13</SUB>, C<SUB>14</SUB>, C<SUB>15</SUB>, C<SUB>16</SUB> and C<SUB>18</SUB>, respectively. The cap is applied in any calculation only if the effluent measured alcohol concentration exceeds: cap x Sum (<ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM><SUB>1-20</SUB>). When alcohol caps are applied to the monitoring data from the eight Canadian municipal <ACRONYM title=""wastewater treatment plant"">WWTP</ACRONYM>, the concentrations of total <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> ranged from 0.8 to 11.5 µg/L with an average of 4.9 µg/L (P&amp;G –Shell 2003).</P><P>From the study of AE concentrations in Canadian municipal wastewater effluents (P&amp;G – Shell 2003; Sherren et al. 2003), it is also possible to determine the average homologue distribution. Applying an alcohol cap, the average alkyl chain length was 13.68 <mark>carbon</mark>s long, and the average ethoxylate chain consisted of 5.03 ethoxylate units (Scott Belanger, Procter &amp; Gamble, pers. comm. 2004). In other words, the average homologue distribution in Canadian municipal wastewater effluents is C<SUB>13.7</SUB><ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM><SUB>5</SUB>.</P><DIV class=""alignRight""><P><A href=""#top"" title=""Return to Top of Page"">Top of Page</A></P></DIV><H2>Mode of action</H2><P>Although the exact mechanism by which <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> affect aquatic organisms is not fully understood, it is likely that they act through nonspecific narcosis depending on the number of <ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM> units (Roberts 1991; Dorn et al. 1997a; Müller et al. 1999a). Narcosis is a nonspecific, reversible mode of toxic action in which the presence of hydrophobic organic chemicals causes a disruption of cellular activity. Many researchers suspect that surfactants such as AE can disrupt gill membranes in fish, invertebrates and amphibians, and cause the gill epithelial cells to swell and secrete mucous (Moore et al. 1987; Cardellini and Ometto 2001). These cell membrane disruptions can affect diffusion of oxygen across the gills, ultimately resulting in suffocation (Moore et al. 1987; Cardellini and Ometto 2001).</P><P>In algal cells, surfactants such as AE are thought to denature and bind proteins in the cell wall, thereby altering the permeability of the cell membrane to nutrients and chemicals (Lewis 1990). The susceptibility of algal species can vary depending on the thickness and chemical composition of their cell walls. Algal species with thicker cell walls will be affected less by exposure to surfactants (Nyberg 1988; Lewis 1990). Hydrophobic surfactants will more easily penetrate algal species with high lipid and protein content in their cell walls (Lewis 1990).</P><P>In some cases, AE toxicity can also result from physical surface active effects. When applied to the surface of water bodies, AE can form a film that alters the water surface tension, thereby affecting surface breathing or water striding invertebrate larvae or adults (Mulla et al. 1983).</P><DIV class=""alignRight""><P><A href=""#top"" title=""Return to Top of Page"">Top of Page</A></P></DIV><H2>Freshwater toxicity</H2><P>Fish and invertebrates are generally more sensitive to AE than plants or algae (Bisop and Perry 1981; Dorn et al. 1997b). The toxicity of individual AE homologues is a function of their chemical structure. The toxicity of AE increases with increasing alkyl chain length (Wong et al. 1997; Dorn et al. 1997a; Lizotte, Jr. et al. 1999; Ghirardini et al. 2001), and with decreasing ethoxylate chain length (Macek and Krzeminski 1975; Maki and Bishop 1979; Yamane et al. 1984; Wong et al. 1997; Raney 2000). In addition, to the length of the alkyl chain, the structure of the chain can also affect its toxicity as linear <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> are more toxic than branched <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> (Dorn et al. 1993; Kaluza and Taeger 1996; Ghirardini et al. 2001). Other factors that have been demonstrated to affect toxicity are the location of attachment between the alcohol and ethoxylate chains (e.g., primary vs. secondary alcohols) (Kurata et al. 1977), the homologue distribution of the ethoxylate chain (Garcia et al. 1996), water hardness (Tovell et al. 1975), and temperature (Lewis and Hamm 1986).</P><P>Commercial <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> consist of a mixture of various AE homologues which differ in their relative toxicity. As a result, direct comparisons cannot be made among all of the available AE toxicity studies because they involve tests on numerous different mixtures. Commercial AE mixtures that are used in toxicity testing will also differ in their homologue distributions from the AE mixtures that are found in the aquatic environment following varying degrees of biodegradation. Therefore, direct comparisons cannot be made between results of laboratory toxicity tests and total AE concentrations that are measured in ambient waters. For the purpose of assessing acceptable levels of AE in water, a solution is to normalize the toxicity data to a common homologue distribution.</P><P>A monitoring survey of Canadian municipal wastewater effluents identified the average AE homologue distribution, in Canadian effluents, adjusted for an alcohol cap, to be C<SUB>13.7</SUB><ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM><SUB>5</SUB> (Scott Belanger, Procter &amp; Gamble, pers. comm. 2004). Where the exact homologue distribution of <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> at a particular site is unknown, this average distribution can be used as the structure to which all acceptable reported AE toxicity data are normalized. It should be noted, however, that this average distribution is based solely on analyses of municipal wastewater effluents. Where <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> in ambient Canadian waters originate from other types of sources, such as discharges from industries, it is possible that the average homologue distribution will differ, due to differences in the types of parent <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> that are used.</P><P>AE toxicity data were normalised based on the predicted effect concentrations for both the test structure and the normalized structure as determined through the use of quantitative structure-activity relationship models (<ACRONYM title=""quantitative structure activity relationship"">QSAR</ACRONYM>s).

The sorption correction was made to account for homologue-specific sorption to effluent suspended solids, with the assumption that sorbed fractions are not bioavailable, and therefore are not contributing to the toxicity of the AE distribution. Adjustments for sorption were made using a <ACRONYM title=""quantitative structure activity relationship"">QSAR</ACRONYM> based on a regression between K<SUB>d</SUB> or K<SUB>oc</SUB> and chain length and ethoxylate number (van Compernolle et al. 2006). This is made possible because all sorption studies have utilized pure materials and not mixtures. The sorption corrections were used to adjust the average environmental homologue distribution. Corrections for solubility were made using a <ACRONYM title=""quantitative structure activity relationship"">QSAR</ACRONYM> developed by Hansch et al. (1968) based on log <ACRONYM title=""octanol: water partition coefficient"">K<SUB>ow</SUB></ACRONYM>. Both the solubility and sorption corrections were used to adjust the average environmental homologue distribution. The solubility corrections, however, were found to have little effect since the AE homologue concentrations measured in Canadian municipal wastewater effluents never exceeded solubility limits. For the <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> used in the toxicity tests it was assumed that all homologues were bioavailable and below solubility limits, so no corrections were needed.</P><P>The sensitivities for <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> overlap among taxa (Table 2). The most sensitive species reported for AE is an invertebrate species bivalve (<EM>Corbicula fluminea</EM>), followed by the water flea (<EM>Daphnia magna</EM>). A mayfly (<EM>Isonychia bicolour</EM>) was the least sensitive invertebrate species in the data set. Among fish species, rainbow trout (<EM>Oncorhynchus mykiss</EM>) and bluegill (<EM>Lepomis macrochirus</EM>) were the most and least sensitive species, respectively. In general, plants tend to be less sensitive than invertebrates and fish, though some plant species may be quite sensitive (i.e., rotifers).

Following the <ACRONYM title=""Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment"">CCME</ACRONYM> protocol (<ACRONYM title=""Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment"">CCME</ACRONYM> 2007), several cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) were fit to the data using regression methods and the best model was selected based on consideration of goodness-of-fit and model feasibility (for details see <ACRONYM title=""Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment"">CCME</ACRONYM> 2007). The logistic model provided the best fit of the models tested and the 5<SUP>th</SUP> percentile (<EM>HC<SUB>5</SUB></EM>) of the <ACRONYM title=""species sensitivity distribution"">SSD</ACRONYM> plot is 70 µg/L,with lower and upper confidence limits of 50 and 110 µg/L, respectively (Figure 1).</P><P>The recommended <ACRONYM title=""Federal Water Quality Guidelines"">FWQG</ACRONYM> is 70 µg/L. The guideline represents the concentration below which you would expect either no, or only a low likelihood of adverse effects on aquatic life. In addition to this guideline, two other concentration ranges are provided for use in risk management. At concentrations between greater than the 5<SUP>th</SUP> and 50<SUP>th</SUP> percentile of the <ACRONYM title=""species sensitivity distribution"">SSD</ACRONYM> (&gt;70-250 µg/L) there is a moderate likelihood of adverse effects to aquatic life. Concentrations greater than the 50<SUP>th</SUP> percentile (&gt;250 µg/L) have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects. Risk managers may find these additional concentration ranges useful in defining short-term or interim risk management objectives for a phased risk management plan. The moderate to higher concentration range may also be used in setting less protective objectives for waters that are already highly degraded or where there are socio-economic considerations that preclude the ability to meet the <ACRONYM title=""Federal Water Quality Guidelines"">FWQG</ACRONYM> (i.e., the 5th percentile).</P><P>This <ACRONYM title=""Federal Water Quality Guidelines"">FWQG</ACRONYM> represents the average homologue distribution of <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> and can be used where the average homologue distribution of AE in the ambient water is known to be C<SUB>13.7</SUB><ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM><SUB>5</SUB>, or this can be used as a default guideline if the average AE homologue distribution at a site is unknown. Guideline values have also been</P><P>determined for a suite of individual AE homologues that could occur in the environment (Table 3). These were determined using the same method used for the default guideline, by normalizing the toxicity data to each individual homologue and creating a <ACRONYM title=""species sensitivity distribution"">SSD</ACRONYM> distribution for each individual homologue. Where possible, it is recommended that concentrations of each individual AE homologue at a site be determined and then compared with the corresponding guideline value given in Table 3 through the use of a Toxic Unit approach.</P><P><STRONG>Table 3.

First, for each homologue, the calculated log P (C log P) (a theoretical measure of hydrophobicity based on structural modelling) value was determined as a function of <mark>carbon</mark> chain length and ethoxylate length measure. The C log P was used in place of log <EM><ACRONYM title=""octanol: water partition coefficient"">K<SUB>ow</SUB></ACRONYM></EM> as it is difficult to obtain octanol-water partitioning coefficients (<EM><ACRONYM title=""octanol: water partition coefficient"">K<SUB>ow</SUB></ACRONYM></EM>s) for <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> because, as surfactants, they do not partition well into either liquid, but rather tend to emulsify the octanol-water interface. With the tendency to form micelles, determination of the <EM><ACRONYM title=""octanol: water partition coefficient"">K<SUB>ow</SUB></ACRONYM></EM> for a surfactant will also be strongly dependent on its concentration (Müller et al. 1999b). Instead, the C logP based on the structure of the chemical can be determined using a modified version of the fragment method of Leo and Hansch (Roberts 1991; Roberts and Marshall 1995). In this method, using</P><P>linear C<SUB>12</SUB><ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM><SUB>1</SUB> with a logP of 5.23 as the parent compound, an increment of 0.54 is added for each additional <mark>carbon</mark> unit, and an increment of –0.10 is used for each additional <ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM> group. To adjust for branching in the <mark>carbon</mark> chain, the term [1.44 log (C<SUB>s</SUB> + 1)] is subtracted, where C<SUB>s</SUB> is the <mark>carbon</mark> number of the shorter chain (Roberts and Marshall 1995).</P><P>Next, for each specific homologue in question, the appropriate <ACRONYM title=""quantitative structure activity relationship"">QSAR</ACRONYM> equation found in Table 4 was used to predict the toxicity for each of the available toxicity endpoints listed in Table 2 (for 17 species = three fish species, eight invertebrate species and six plant species) given the toxicity of the original AE tested. A species sensitivity distribution was then constructed for each specific homologue. The HC<SUB>5</SUB> from the species sensitivity distribution was determined as the <ACRONYM title=""Federal Water Quality Guidelines"">FWQG</ACRONYM> for each specific AE homologue which appears in each cell of Table 3.</P><P><STRONG>Table 4.

Together with the other values shown in Figure 1, these guidelines can be used when the average homologue distribution of <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> at a particular site are unknown. A simple measurement of total AE in the ambient waters can be compared with the guideline values to determine whether there is an exceedence. This is the most simple and cost effective approach, as chemical analyses for individual homologues can be costly, and very few analytical laboratories are currently set up to do them. Although analyses of individual homologues are not required to use the default guidelines, the analytical method used should be capable of detection at low ppb concentrations, as well as detection of free fatty alcohols and <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> with short <ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM> chains.</P><P>The default guidelines are based on an environmental distribution expressed for convenience as a C<SUB>13.7</SUB><ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM><SUB>5</SUB> AE, which is likely characteristic of many sites where the main source of <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> is through municipal wastewater effluents. Where <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> in the ambient water are originating from other sources, such as industrial outflows, the average homologue distribution may be considerably different. If an initial measurement of total AE at the site has been found to exceed the default guidelines, then more in-depth evaluation through analysis of specific homologues could be considered. Use of the homologue-specific guidelines will give a better indication of whether <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> present at a particular site are in fact likely to cause adverse effects or not. In these cases, it would be advisable to use the homologue-specific guideline values presented in Table 3.</P><P>For determining the concentrations of individual AE homologues in ambient water at a particular site, the current recommended analytical approach is the pyridinium <ACRONYM title=""lethal concentration"">LC</ACRONYM>/MS method (Dunphy et al. 2001). Concentrations should be determined, at a minimum, for homologues with alkyl chains between 12 and 18 <mark>carbon</mark>s long (excluding C<SUB>17</SUB><ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM>), and ethoxylate chains ranging from 0 to 18 <ACRONYM title=""ethylene oxide"">EO</ACRONYM> units long. The measured concentrations of the homologues can then be compared with the homologue -specific guideline values in Table 3 using a Toxic Unit approach (see Boeije et al. 2006 for additional background on the construction of Toxic Unit approaches for <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM>). For each individual homologue, the measured concentration is divided by the corresponding homologue -specific guideline listed in Table 3 to obtain the toxic unit for that particular homologue. The toxic units for all homologues present in the sample are then summed. If the total of all toxic units is less than or equal to one, then the AE guideline has not been exceeded. If the total of all toxic units is greater than one, this indicates an exceedence of the guideline.</P><P>For alcohol alkoxylates, where the hydrophilic chain of the surfactant contains a mix of ethoxylate, propoxylate, and/or butoxylate groups, the <ACRONYM title=""Federal Water Quality Guidelines"">FWQG</ACRONYM>s for <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> may also be applied. This recommendation is based on data (see Roberts et al. 2007) that suggest that alcohol alkoxylates have similar aquatic toxicity to <ACRONYM title=""alcohol ethoxylates"">AEs</ACRONYM> of the same parent alcohol and with similar numbers of ethoxylate groups.</P><DIV class=""alignRight""><P><A href=""#top"" title=""Return to Top of Page"">Top of Page</A></P></DIV><H2>References</H2><P>Aveyard, R. 1984.

However, companies committed to sustainability are interested in more methods that examine their products and activities' impacts. Methods that build on LCA strengths and illuminate other connected but less understood facets, related to social and economic impacts, would provide greater value to decision-makers. This study is a LCA that calculates the potential impacts associated with Bounty<SUP>®</SUP> paper towels from two facilities with different production lines, an older one (Albany, Georgia) representing established technology and the other (Box Elder, Utah), a newer state-of-the-art platform. This is unique in that it includes use of Industrial Process Systems Assessment (IPSA), new electricity and pulp data, modeled in open source software, and is the basis for the development of new integrated sustainability metrics (published separately). The new metrics can guide supply chain and manufacturing enhancements, and product design related to environmental protection and resource sustainability. Results of the LCA indicate Box Elder had improvements on environmental impact scores related to air emission indicators, except for particulate matter. Albany had lower water use impacts. After normalization of the results, fossil fuel depletion is the most critical environmental indicator. Pulp production, electricity, and fuels for product production drive fossil fuel depletion. <mark>Climate change</mark>, land occupation, and particulate matter are also relevant. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by pulp, electricity, papermaking, and landfill methane from the disposed product, drive <mark>climate change</mark> impacts. Pulp provides significant offsets to balance <mark>climate change</mark> impacts due to sequestration of atmospheric <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. Ninety-nine percent of land occupation is for the growth of the trees for pulp production. Papermaking, electricity, and pulp production cause the most potential particular matter formation.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><UL class=""issue-navigation"" id=""issue-navigation""><LI class=""previous""><BUTTON class=""button-alternative button-alternative-tertiary"" disabled="""" type=""button""><SPAN class=""button-alternative-text""><SPAN><STRONG>Previous </STRONG>article<SPAN class=""extra-detail""> in issue</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></BUTTON></LI></UL></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

 (847) 866-4296 or <STRONG><A href=""mailto:cnies@gbophb.org"">cnies@gbophb.org</A></STRONG></P><P><EM>Glenview, IL</EM>—The General Board of Pension and Health Benefits through its Wespath Investment Management division (GBPHB/Wespath) is collaborating with other global, <mark>sustainable</mark> investors for the 2016 corporate annual general meeting (AGM) or “proxy voting” season by filing and supporting shareholder resolutions aiming to improve company responses to the threat of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>Addressing the Risks of <mark>Climate Change</mark></STRONG>
 GBPHB/Wespath directly encourages companies to adopt more environmentally sensitive and socially just business policies that are transformative in supporting a more <mark>sustainable</mark> future for companies and society as a whole. Experience demonstrates that the agency has significantly greater influence when it remains engaged with companies and active in drawing attention to these important issues—rather than selling shares and losing a voice for The United Methodist Church.</P><P>
 The overwhelming majority of <mark>climate</mark> scientists agree that the world is warming. GBPHB recognizes this threat and the urgent need for cooperation among governments, businesses, investors and consumers to change the ways in which people live—reducing <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and limiting <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>Filing <mark>Climate Change</mark>-Related Shareholder Resolutions</STRONG>
 GBPHB/Wespath has established investment policy guidelines that address the risk of loss to the value of our investments resulting from un<mark>sustainable</mark> business practices, including the risks of <mark>climate change</mark>. These guidelines have resulted in the exclusion of major “pure-play” thermal coal companies and coal-dependent utilities. While GBPHB/Wespath remains invested in many of the world’s largest oil, gas and mining companies, it continues to demonstrate leadership among the global investment community in encouraging these companies to support an orderly transition to a lower-<mark>carbon</mark> economy.</P><P>
 Early results from this year’s proxy season—which has seen a record number of <mark>climate</mark>-related resolutions—indicate an important shift in investor engagement and in company responses. GBPHB/Wespath believes this is a critical time for the UMC to remain engaged in these discussions with companies and with fellow investors around the world.</P><P><B>Anglo American</B>—GBPHB/Wespath co-filed a resolution asking for additional reporting on the environmental risks and opportunities associated with <mark>climate change</mark>. The resolution was supported by company management and received 96.25% support from investors. The resolution is binding according to the laws of the United Kingdom, where Anglo American is domiciled. This level of support mirrors results last year for similar resolutions at BP, Shell and Statoil, but is otherwise unprecedented for environmental resolutions.</P><P><B>Occidental Petroleum and Chevron</B>—GBPHB/Wespath led the filing of shareholder resolutions requesting that both companies provide additional disclosure to investors about scenario planning and the ways in which they are “stress-testing” their fossil fuel portfolios in anticipation of a lower-<mark>carbon</mark> future. The management of both companies do not support the resolutions. However, GBPHB/Wespath believes this type of analysis is critical in understanding each company’s long-term strategic positioning within the rapidly transforming energy sector as renewable energy costs fall and markets face disruption that may occur faster than anticipated. Initial, conservative results from Occidental’s April 29 AGM indicate that more than one-third of investors supported the resolution, a very significant vote for a “first-time” <mark>climate</mark> resolution filed with a company. Wespath has also received commitments of support from many of the largest international institutional investment funds for the resolution at Chevron.</P><P>
 Additional information about these shareholder resolutions, GBPHB/Wespath’s voting activity and voting results of the annual general meetings is available on the <STRONG><A href=""https://www.wespath.org/investments/sri/proxy-voting/"">GBPHB</A></STRONG> and <STRONG><A href=""http://www.wespath.com/investment_philosophy/proxy_voting/"">Wespath</A></STRONG> websites.</P><P><STRONG>Investing in <mark>Climate</mark> Solutions</STRONG>
 GBPHB/Wespath continues to invest in companies that are helping the world mitigate and adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>.

And they’re thinking about price certainty. Fossil fuel-based electricity prices are volatile; with wind and solar energy, once a facility is built, long-term prices are essentially locked in, because the ongoing cost of the “fuel” (the wind and the sun) is zero.</P><P>Taking advantage of lower power costs and locking in those lower prices, says Tawney, makes corporate buyers more competitive. It also expands the number of people at the table advocating for renewable energy technologies.</P><P>Every renewable energy project has direct and indirect impacts on the market and economy, says Lily Donge, a principal with RMI who leads the Business Renewables Center. As electricity from wind and solar energy continues to become even cheaper, and technologies continue to improve, the free market will drive more project expansion. And every time companies demand new wind and solar projects, she says, they’re also creating new jobs and boosting local economies.</P><P>“There’s a ripple effect: A company’s customers and employees can become increasingly aligned on a common vision” says Donge. That’s a fairly new phenomenon, she says.</P><DIV style=""width: auto;""><H2 class=""hdr-story"" style=""border-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;"">Accelerating Change</H2></DIV><P>Facebook was involved in discussions about the Buyers’ Principles from the beginning. “Our business is all about connecting people,” says Bill Weihl, Facebook’s sustainability director. “Running those services requires significant infrastructure that uses a lot of energy, and we’re committed to powering all that connectivity with the smallest footprint possible.”</P><P>The company had worked privately with WWF and WRI in the past, he says, but it wanted to do more. It didn’t want to just sign on to another letter or statement of support. Its employees wanted the company to create change directly. About five years ago, says Weihl, Facebook committed to powering its infrastructure with 100% clean energy. And while no one expects the change to occur overnight, they do want it done quickly, while also adding meaningful amounts of renewable energy to the grid.</P><P>When looking to build a new data center, for example, the company isn’t just looking for land or a workforce—Facebook also wants assurances that the region’s utility can supply renewable energy. And not just for itself. “When we move into a new area, we’re not just looking for a contract for ourselves: We like to see market access open up to as many other companies as possible,” says Weihl. “When we or other companies have gone into North Carolina or Oregon to build data centers, other companies tend to follow.”</P><P>That’s where REBA and the Buyers’ Principles come in, says Weihl. Facebook found it could get further, faster, by working with other companies than by trying to do it on its own.</P><P>Like Facebook, General Motors (GM) uses a lot of energy. Each year, the company spends about a billion dollars on utilities, including water, gas, and electricity, says David Tulauskas, GM’s director of sustainability. “We’re always looking at reducing that cost,” he says.</P><P>Tulauskas, too, has been part of REBA discussions since the beginning. “If you build it, we will come,” he jokes, pointing out that during early discussions with WWF and WRI, a lot of time was spent talking about “pain points” that would need to be alleviated to create a more harmonized, systematic approach to procuring more renewable energy.</P><P>In 2016, GM completed its largest green energy purchase to date—making all of its facilities in Texas powered by renewable energy. “And we’ve made a commitment to go 100% renewable energy by 2050,” says Tulauskas, adding that renewable energy has been a “mainstream option” for GM for a long time. The company implemented its first low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy project, a landfill gas project at one of its factories, more than 20 years ago. And the company has accelerated its use of renewable energy for a couple of reasons, including GM’s significant focus on addressing <mark>climate change</mark>. The company wants to be a part of the solution, he says, especially as the transportation industry shifts toward the use of electrified vehicles.</P><P>“We want to make sure the grid is cleaner, because it maximizes the benefits of electrified vehicles,” he says. “We don’t want to transfer the problems from our tailpipes to smokestacks, so we’re taking kind of a holistic approach.”</P><P>He says the Buyers’ Principles laid out what could be done more consistently, what could be standardized, and how companies and utilities could streamline renewable energy projects.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""wrapper""><DIV class=""row gutter-horiz-in wysiwyg lead""><DIV class=""span12""><H2 class=""hdr-story"">Collaborative Conversations</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""wrapper container""><DIV class=""aside-container break-full gutter-bottom-2 push-right gutter-left-fixed-2""><DIV class=""wysiwyg aside bordered""><H3 class=""hdr-aside"">GOING GLOBAL</H3><P>Building on its US track record, the<STRONG> Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance</STRONG> is poised to grow globally in 2017.</P><P>“WWF and our REBA partners are exploring opportunities to build out REBA in countries like India, China, and Mexico, among others,” says WWF’s Marty Spitzer. “Our success in the US has global companies, such as Procter &amp; Gamble and GM, acutely interested in how REBA could advance renewables elsewhere.”</P><P>REBA’s global prospects received a boost when it was featured as one of the major corporate renewable energy purchasing initiatives endorsed by governments last June at the Clean Energy Ministerial meeting, a high-level global forum of 24 countries, including the US and the European Union. With support from governments around the world, REBA can begin to bring its success in the United States to other key economies that will be crucial in the fight against <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>According to Spitzer, corporate buyers of renewable energy in other countries often face even greater challenges than do buyers in the US, even as the economics of renewables have become favorable globally. Yet while challenges may differ, he says, business voices can be influential in identifying and overcoming them, just as they are in the US. And, he says, expanding REBA beyond the US would have the added bonus of helping a number of developing economies meet their emission reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""gutter-horiz-in lead wysiwyg"" data-track-block=""Magazine/Articles Show|Article Body Click""><P>Working with utilities through the Buyers’ Principles has opened new doors for many companies, says WWF’s manager for renewable energy, Bryn Baker. “Companies don’t want to be in the energy business,” she says. “They would much prefer to buy renewable energy through their utility, and therein lies the opportunity for collaborative conversation.”</P><P>Conversations between big companies and utilities are happening with greater frequency now, thanks to REBA and the Buyers’ Principles. Those conversations have also changed.</P><P>“When you bring to the utilities a group of the largest, most iconic buyers, and have them all in the room together, you can have a very different conversation with that utility about how they might want to think about moving their products and meeting their customers’ changing needs,” says WRI’s Tawney. She says that when these conversations first started, organizations like hers were still trying to explain why buyers found value in renewable energy and trying to address misconceptions about technological problems (like intermittent service) and price. “The nature of the conversations with the utilities has just changed enormously in the past two years,” she says.</P><P>Aakash Chandarana, vice president for rates and regulatory affairs at Xcel Energy, agrees. “There are some perceptions out there from time to time that utilities are not very innovative and that we’re not responsive enough to customers because we’re monopolies. I don’t think those are unfair assessments.” But more and more utilities are trying to create solutions, says Chandarana, who participates in facilitated dialogues with corporate buyers, “by listening to their customers and trying to understand what drives their choices.”</P><P>For example, Xcel had a new program recently approved for its Minnesota customers. By signing up for Renewable*Connect, Minnesotans will be able to “subscribe” to electricity from solar or wind facilities for one, five, or ten years.</P><P>“The longer you sign up, the more money you have the likelihood of saving,” he says. “Our customers like the certainty and transparency of knowing where their energy is coming from, and businesses can budget for what their energy costs will be during that period of time.” Such customer choice programs are becoming more common across the country, giving homeowners and businesses the opportunity to be part of the switch to renewable power.</P><P>Chandarana says the utility appreciated the invitation from REBA to enter into dialogue with corporate buyers. “To the extent that there’s desire to de<mark>carbon</mark>ize and improve the environment, utilities like Xcel have a critical role to play in adding renewables to the system and providing the benefits of those renewables directly to customers,” he says. “With REBA, we can help bring products and services into the regional marketplace that our customers can use to make their sustainability goals and, at the same time, reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> footprint.”</P><P>Utilities, he adds, are also talking to one another more than in the past. “We can sit down together and understand what others are doing in their respective footprints, and see if there’s something new we can learn from each other,” he says. “As other utilities watch the reaction of customers, like to Renewable*Connect, they can pick up the phone and call us, and say, ‘How did you do that? How did you build that? What are the principles that went into that?’”</P><H2 class=""hdr-story""><mark>Sustainable</mark> Momentum</H2><P>The acceleration of renewables procurement has astounded everyone working with REBA. But there’s still work to be done, says WWF’s Baker. That includes making it easier for small buyers to participate—by aggregating their demand and lowering the transaction costs—and bringing in more of the biggest energy buyers, like heavy industry, hospital networks, and the military. And ultimately, it needs to become easier for everyone to buy cheap, clean renewable energy, which means utilities use the flexibility they already have to offer renewables widely, or that utility rules and policies in some states across the country may need changing.</P><P>While REBA has focused on corporations, WRI’s Tawney thinks it’s going to have an impact across markets. If buying renewable energy makes sense for the largest corporations, like Walmart and Google, she points out, public utility commissions and cities will start realizing that it’s good for all ratepayers.</P><P>With prices still falling and the demand for renewables rising, Tawney thinks the market is going to continue expanding, regardless of policies or political uncertainty. “We need to drive a truck through the window that opened when the price of renewables fell—and we need to do it as fast as we can,” she says. “We don’t need to have a fight. It’s apolitical. It’s good common economic sense. And if you increase the number of people at the table, then it’s harder to stop.”<A href=""http://buyersprinciples.org/""><STRONG>Learn more about Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers' Principles.</STRONG></A></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""wrapper""><DIV class=""row gutter-horiz-in wysiwyg lead""><DIV class=""span12""><DIV class=""row horiz-separators gutter-top-in-4 gutter-bottom-in-4 gutter-bottom-5 medium-add-gutter""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""span9 push-right""><DIV class=""quote-big""><P>“In light of the election, the role that U.S. companies, as well as other major energy buyers, including cities, play is even more essential.

TerraCycle, the global leader in recycling hard-to-recycle waste has been named a winner of a United Nations Momentum for Change Lighthouse Activity award. The recognition is for the initiative announced earlier this year with TerraCycle, Procter &amp; Gamble and SUEZ to create <A href=""http://www.beautypackaging.com/contents/view_online-exclusives/2017-05-08/pg-launches-breakthrough-recyclable-shampoo-bottle/"" target=""_blank"">the world’s first fully recyclable shampoo bottle made with beach plastic</A>. TerraCycle will receive this prestigious award in Bonn, Germany in November during the United Nations <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference (COP23). 
The shampoo bottle, made for the world’s No.1 shampoo brand, Head &amp; Shoulders, contains 25% beach plastic that is collected from beaches, oceans, rivers and other waterways. TerraCycle manages the collection process, working with NGOs and cleanup organizations on six continents. The project was announced at the World Economic Forum in January and the first bottles went on store shelves in France this summer. “We are so honored to be recognized for the work we and our partners are doing to take action against some of the world’s biggest environmental issues,” said TerraCycle CEO Tom Szaky. “We hope that calling attention to this project will help people become aware of the magnitude of the beach plastic problem and be inspired to get involved.” 
TerraCycle is known for developing scientific solutions for hard-to-recycle items such as chip bags, coffee capsules, pens, and even cigarette butts among many others things and converting them into raw materials.  TerraCycle collects, converts and sells over 100 waste streams in the U.S. that were originally destined for landfills. 
The Momentum for Change initiative, spearheaded by the UN <mark>Climate Change</mark> secretariat, shines light on some of the most innovative, scalable and practical examples of what people across the globe are doing to combat <mark>climate change</mark>. Momentum for Change is a part of wider efforts to mobilize action and ambition, as national governments work toward implementing the Paris <mark>Climate Change</mark> Agreement and the <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals. TerraCycle, P&amp;G and SUEZ were one of four winners in the Planetary Health pillar, and one of only 19 winners overall. </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Cities such as Seattle have moved to prohibit restaurants from <A href=""https://www.newsdeeply.com/oceans/articles/2017/11/01/strawless-in-seattle-how-one-city-is-tackling-ocean-plastic-<mark>pollution</mark>"" target=""_blank"">offering single-use plastic straws</A> and other nonrecyclable items, a policy increasingly adopted around the world.</P><P>Big corporations clearly are getting the message. In December, Dell, General Motors and other companies formed the <A href=""https://www.newsdeeply.com/oceans/articles/2017/12/12/dell-gm-to-create-ocean-plastic-supply-chain-to-fight-marine-<mark>pollution</mark>"" target=""_blank"">NextWave consortium</A> with nonprofit Lonely Whale to build a supply chain to intercept ocean-bound plastic trash and turn it into everything from packaging and furniture to bicycle parts.</P><P>Consumer products giant Procter <SPAN class=""amp"">&amp;</SPAN> Gamble, along with Unilever, PepsiCo and other Fortune 500 corporations, are appearing at <A href=""https://www.newsdeeply.com/oceans/articles/2017/10/11/see-who-just-pledged-8-billion-to-protect-the-ocean"" target=""_blank"">high-profile ocean conferences to make commitments</A> to reduce their plastic use and launch initiatives to recycle marine plastic debris.</P><P>At last year’s World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, <SPAN class=""caps"">P&amp;G</SPAN> unveiled a new bottle for its Head <SPAN class=""amp"">&amp;</SPAN> Shoulders shampoo comprising up to <A href=""https://www.headandshoulders.com/en-us/whats-new/new-head-shoulders-bottle-to-be-made-with-recycled-beach-plastic"" target=""_blank"">25 percent plastic collected from beaches</A>. And at the Our Ocean conference in Malta in October, the company introduced a Fairy washing-up liquid soap bottle made with 10 percent beach plastic and 90 percent other recycled plastic.</P><P>At this year’s World Economic Forum meeting in January, News Deeply’s executive editor and chief executive Lara Setrakian met with Virginie Helias, <SPAN class=""caps"">P&amp;G</SPAN>’s vice president for global sustainability, to talk about the company’s ocean plastic efforts, new technologies to reduce waste and the importance of collaboration in tackling the marine <mark>pollution</mark> crisis.</P><H2>Oceans Deeply: Why are consumers and <SPAN class=""caps"">P&amp;G</SPAN> focused on the ocean plastic issue?</H2><P>Virginie Helias: When you think about it, it’s kind of logical, because when you go grocery shopping, the first thing that happens is you have a full bin of unnecessary packaging that you throw away. So it’s the most tangible for people, that packaging is there and it doesn’t go away, and also, they are paying for something that they don’t use.</P><P>If we look at <SPAN class=""caps"">P&amp;G</SPAN> products and where our <mark>carbon</mark> footprint is, 70 percent is in the usage of our product, which is basically the warm water that people need to wash their clothes and shave and brush their teeth. So packaging is a small part of this, but for our consumers, it’s the most important part.</P><P>We absolutely need to recognize that. One, it is a planetary issue that gets into the ocean and in the food chain and then ultimately to our plates. So it really is an important issue.</P><H2>Oceans Deeply: What are the concrete signs to you that consumers really care about the plastics issue and plastics in the ocean?</H2><P>Helias: The success of our initiative with Head <SPAN class=""amp"">&amp;</SPAN> Shoulders is a very concrete sign. Frankly, it was an experiment. We had no idea whether people would be interested or not. Changing for us the iconic color of the Head <SPAN class=""amp"">&amp;</SPAN> Shoulders bottle, which is blue and white, into gray, was a huge deal internally, and it was also a bit of a bet. It turned out to be in the top 10 sales in France where we piloted it. Amazing, amazing appeal from the retailers, and helping us in getting people in-store because they need a little bit of education around what this is about. Also, the fact that we were allowing people to participate in the beach collection. There was a beach cleanup where you can go and participate. We had 1,000 volunteers to collect the plastic from the French beaches.</P><DIV id=""attachment_126826"" style=""width: 1210px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Virginie Helias, <SPAN class=""caps"">P&amp;G</SPAN>’s vice president for global sustainability, and Terracycle chief executive Tom Szaky holding a Head <SPAN class=""amp"">&amp;</SPAN> Shoulders bottle made from recycled beach plastic. (Twitter)</P></DIV><P>It shows that there is international appeal, and we are now taking this initiative to more brands, more countries all around the world. There is clearly interest. Why? Because the ocean captures, frankly, the imagination of people. Usually, sustainability’s like so daunting, like, “What can I do?” But here, we tell them, “Visually, you are not going to clean the ocean, but just by recycling your Head <SPAN class=""amp"">&amp;</SPAN> Shoulders bottle, this is how you can help and be part of the circular economy.” This is very rewarding for people. We have tangible signs there is interest and we want to take it to the next level now.</P><H2>Oceans Deeply: Where does it go next? You talked about other countries.</H2><P>Helias: We were in <A href=""https://www.newsdeeply.com/oceans/articles/2017/10/11/see-who-just-pledged-8-billion-to-protect-the-ocean"" target=""_blank"">Malta at the Our Ocean conference</A> when we announced that we are doing this for the Fairy brand. It’s totally iconic, stays on your kitchen counter, so every day you can see it and it says, “Ocean plastic,” and you are reminded of the issue of ocean plastic <mark>pollution</mark>. But more importantly, the role you can personally play by just going and recycling your bottle. We do Fairy with Tesco in the <SPAN class=""caps"">U.K.</SPAN> We’re launching this spring in Israel. We are launching in Germany.</P><P>We are often told, “Well, but it’s a drop in the ocean,” no pun intended. It’s true. It’s “storied plastic,” we call it. It’s to raise awareness about the issue, but in terms of addressing the problem at scale, we do many more things that we don’t necessarily advertise. When we announced Head <SPAN class=""amp"">&amp;</SPAN> Shoulders beach plastic, it was actually a double announcement. We said, “We are doing the beach plastic, but at the same time, we commit that by the end of this year, 90 percent of all the shampoos we sell in Europe will have up to 25 percent post-consumer recycled plastic.” We’ve committed to double the amount of recycled plastic by 2020.</P><H2>Oceans Deeply: Do you feel the industry is following your lead on this?</H2><P>Helias: Yes, we’ve heard of many other initiatives on beach plastic and, obviously, we’ve heard of all the commitment on the recyclability, which is part of the same thing. It’s clearly a focus, and it’s a race to the top, which is quite fun to watch.</P><P>Polypropylene is a broadly used resin, but the applications for recycling polypropylenes are very limited because it kind of stinks, so there is odor, the color is kind of gray, there are a lot of contaminants. One of our scientists developed this amazing <mark>innovation</mark> that turns recycled polypropylene, which is usually gray-black and doesn’t have a good odor, to a virgin-like state, and then it can reenter the manufacturing process and be recycled again like a virgin material.</P><H2>Oceans Deeply: Is this, for you, a generational issue in terms of consumer attitudes? Are you seeing signs that your next generation of consumers at <SPAN class=""caps"">P&amp;G</SPAN> cares more about this?</H2><P>Helias: Definitely. We have 95,000 employees. Each time I say, “<SPAN class=""caps"">OK</SPAN>, we are going to do this project,” I don’t need to ask for resources. I have droves of millennials coming to me saying, “I want to work on a project like this.” Actually, now if they’re joining the company it’s already because they know that the company’s doing things like that. It’s become such an important cause. What’s very interesting is my generation has kids who are in this generation, right? A number of senior leaders come to me saying, “Actually, can you talk to my daughter? She’s doing an <SPAN class=""caps"">MBA</SPAN> on sustainability.” They are pushed and that’s great, because they can’t look them in the eyes without doing something.</P><H2>Oceans Deeply: As you scale up efforts, what do you think is going to be the biggest stumbling block or the hardest challenge to actually impacting this issue?</H2><P>Helias: The challenge is that it is all about collaboration. We are in this task force, which is called <A href=""http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20170404/NEWS/304049998/pg-led-workshop-to-review-tracing-plastics-for-recycling"" target=""_blank"">Holy Grail</A>, well named, which is about using tracer technology to better sort plastic. So that the end value is higher because it’s better sorted. Those are things we’ve never done before. We need to build the capability there, and we need to just have this new mindset of it’s a shared obligation. It’s kind of a new theme. It’s not just competition and <mark>innovation</mark>. We need all that. We need, clearly, <mark>innovation</mark>, but we need to participate in these societal collaboration efforts.</P><H2>Oceans Deeply: Anything else you want people to understand about how you see this issue or where you want it to go next?</H2><P class=""fin"">Helias: I’d like just to mention that when people think about recyclability, they immediately think about packaging, but there are actually even more important issues that are more visible, like diapers. We make diapers. People don’t think immediately of diapers as plastic. I don’t know if you’ve heard of it, but we’ve qualified a technology to recycle diapers, and we are super proud of this. It’s an operation in Italy. We have announced we are launching in Amsterdam. We have a few other cities lined up, and this is huge because as the rates of recycling plastic increase, what’s left? A big part of it is diapers.</P></DIV><DIV class=""tags""><A href=""/oceans/tag/circular-economy"">circular economy</A><A href=""/oceans/tag/new-plastic-economy"">New Plastic Economy</A><A href=""/oceans/tag/ocean-plastic"">ocean plastic</A><A href=""/oceans/tag/procter-gamble"">Procter &amp; Gamble</A><A href=""/oceans/tag/virginie-helias"">Virginie Helias</A></DIV></DIV><ASIDE class=""sidebar""><SECTION class=""widget newsletter""><H3>Never miss an update.</H3><P>Sign up for our newsletter to receive weekly updates, special reports and featured insights as we cover one of the most critical issues of our time.</P><FORM action=""//newsdeeply.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe/post-json?u=8b78e9a34ff7443ec1e8c62c6&amp;amp;id=dfde037196&amp;c=?"" method=""post"" class=""chimp mail-chimp-form "" data-context=""article-detail&gt;""><BUTTON class=""btn"" type=""submit"" value=""Subscribe"" name=""subscribe""><SPAN class=""ding""></SPAN> Subscribe</BUTTON></FORM></SECTION></ASIDE></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

On March 22, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that Exxon Mobil must allow its shareholders to vote on a <mark>climate change</mark> resolution as part of the company’s annual proxy. If the proposed resolution is approved, Exxon would have to detail specific risks of <mark>climate change</mark>, or <mark>climate change</mark>-related legislation, that could negatively impact its profitability.</P><P>The following day, a major charity, the Rockefeller Family Fund, announced that it would dispose of its holdings in Exxon as part of a plan to divest all investments in fossil fuels companies as quickly as possible. It was a startling statement, considering that John D. Rockefeller, Sr. co-founded Standard Oil Co., an Exxon predecessor company, from which the Rockefeller family derived most of its wealth.</P><P>On March 29, attorneys general from Massachusetts and the U.S. Virgin Islands <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/science/new-york-<mark>climate</mark>-change-inquiry-into-exxon-adds-prosecutors.html"" target=""_blank"">said they would join</A> in the New York investigation.</P><P>Also back in November, Schneiderman announced its finding that Peabody Energy, the world’s largest publicly traded coal company, “violated New York laws prohibiting false and misleading conduct in the company’s statements to the public and investors regarding financial risks associated with <mark>climate change</mark> and potential regulatory responses.”</P><P>Peabody agreed to file revised shareholder disclosures with the SEC, affirming that “concerns about the environmental impacts of coal combustion … could significantly affect demand for our products or our securities.”</P><H4><STRONG>Does Two Make a Trend?</STRONG></H4><P>But are these cases one-offs — or, as it were, two-offs? Or at least, will we see such actions anywhere but New York, where the attorney general is given extraordinary powers and discretion in fighting financial fraud?</P><P>“The reason you’re seeing these actions in New York is because of the unique characteristics of the <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Act"" target=""_blank"">Martin Act</A>,” says Lindene Patton, an attorney, independent consultant, and former Zurich Insurance executive with long experience in the area of <mark>climate change</mark> risk.</P><P>Specifically, there is no <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scienter"" target=""_blank"">scienter</A> requirement under the Martin Act, meaning a defendant doesn’t have to have <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention_(criminal_law)"" target=""_blank"">intent</A> or knowledge of wrongdoing in order to be found liable for financial fraud.</P><P>But there is a potential for additional litigation, says Passannante: “There haven’t been lots of lawsuits hanging their hat on the SEC’s guidance [on <mark>climate change</mark>-related disclosure issued in 2010]. But when a state attorney general says the kind of things in a press release that were said about Peabody Energy, it makes you pause and wonder whether these sorts of subpoenas and settlements are going to happen to companies in other industries.”</P><P>Industries based on fossil fuels like oil and coal are clearly the most at risk of regulatory impacts on their business related to <mark>climate change</mark>, while manufacturers and utilities also bear significant risk.</P><P>Yet in the risk factors section of its <A href=""http://ww2.cfo.com/disclosure/2016/04/rethinking-disclosure/"" target=""_blank"">10-K filings</A> over the past several years, Exxon “has simply cut and pasted the same, rather generic 100-word statement on its potential risk from <mark>climate</mark> regulations, offering scant data at a time when there have been significant developments,” says Dylan Tanner, executive director of InfluenceMap, a U.K.-based nonprofit that analyzes the extent to which companies influence <mark>climate policy</mark> and legislation.</P><P>Here is that 100-word statement:</P><P>“<STRONG><mark>Climate change</mark> and greenhouse gas restrictions. </STRONG>Due to concern over the risk of <mark>climate change</mark>, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include adoption of cap and trade regimes, <mark>carbon</mark> taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. These requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s, as well as shift hydro<mark>carbon</mark> demand toward relatively lower-<mark>carbon</mark> sources such as natural gas. Current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions.”</P><P>Tanner compares that to disclosures made by Philip Morris. The company “offers two or three pages of detailed regulatory and litigation risks facing its sole product, cigarettes,” he says. “I would class <mark>climate</mark> regulatory risk for Exxon to be of a similar magnitude as tobacco-health regulations for Philip Morris.”</P><DIV id=""attachment_487857"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Rankings as of April 7</P></DIV><P>InfluenceMap grades 122 companies on the degree to which they are supportive or obstructive on a range of <mark>climate</mark> policies, from the acceptance of <mark>climate</mark> science to support for specific legislation that may advance solutions to <mark>climate change</mark>. As of April 7, eight of the 12 lowest-ranked companies were in the energy business (see chart).</P><P>But with regard to disclosure specifically, it’s not just energy companies that are falling short. In a <A href=""http://influencemap.org/site/data/000/104/IM_Report_SEC_Disclosure_Nov_2015.pdf"" target=""_blank"">November 2015 report</A>, InfluenceMap looked at <mark>climate change</mark> disclosures of the 20 largest publicly traded U.S. companies in their 2012, 2013, and 2014 10-K filings and found that a majority of them reported limited or no information.</P><P>The report was especially critical of Boeing, General Electric, and Procter &amp; Gamble, none of which made any mention of <mark>climate</mark> risk. GE, it notes, “has extensive manufacturing facilities and exposure to energy markets that are impacted by <mark>climate change</mark>.” And P&amp;G “made no mention of the risk that <mark>climate change</mark> poses to [its] supply chain,” despite having more than 130 manufacturing facilities in 40 countries.</P><P>Among those three companies, Boeing and GE again did not mention <mark>climate</mark> risk in their 2015 annual reports, while P&amp;G has a June 30 fiscal year-end.</P><P>InfluenceMap’s report contrasted those companies with Coca-Cola, which it said “identifies numerous strands of risks to its operations.”</P><P>Coca-Cola “detailed how increasing global temperatures due to <mark>climate change</mark> could decrease agricultural activity and limit the availability of important sources of ingredients in its products,” the report said. “Coca-Cola further explained how <mark>climate change</mark>-exacerbated water scarcity could impair bottling and production facilities, and that increased extreme weather could disrupt its supply chain.”</P><P>The kind of undisclosed risks that InfluenceMap ascribed to GE and P&amp;G haven’t gotten them in legal trouble to date, but there’s no guarantee about the future. “A company that has exposures in its supply chain, factories, or operations, and isn’t doing anything about them, could face shareholder lawsuits,” he says. “And what you usually see in those is an after-the-fact, second-guessing game about what you didn’t do or what you disclosed or didn’t disclose.”</P><H4><STRONG>Enforcement Outage</STRONG></H4><P>Meanwhile, although the SEC has put guidance on the table about <mark>climate</mark> risk disclosure, so far there has been barely any enforcement activity.</P><P><A href=""http://ww2.cfo.com/sustainability/2014/05/public-companies-earn-poor-grades-sustainability/"" target=""_blank"">Ceres</A>, the nonprofit sustainability advocate, issued a report in 2014 noting that the SEC issued 49 comment letters to companies in 2010 and 2011 that addressed the adequacy of <mark>climate change</mark> disclosure. But there were only three such letters in 2012 and none in 2013, according to the report.</P><P>“Since then, if anything, the SEC has done even less to improve disclosure,” says Jim Coburn, a senior manager at the organization who co-authored the report. “It’s hard for the SEC to investigate every issue that might be material that a company may not be saying enough about, but we definitely think they should be prioritizing this issue more. Without enforcement of the guidelines, most companies are not going to say enough in their filings.”</P><P>While the SEC dawdles, the <A href=""http://www.fsb.org/"" target=""_blank"">Financial Stability Board</A>, formed in 2009 to coordinate the development of regulatory and other financial-sector policies to promote global financial stability, is taking on <mark>climate</mark> risk disclosure.</P><P>The board announced in December the establishment of a task force to study the matter, chaired by Bloomberg LP boss and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Graeme Pitkethly, CFO of Unilever, a company that InfluenceMap ranks highly, is the group’s vice chair.</P><P>But while disclosure may help investors with decision-making, how much can it be expected to move the needle in the more important search for solutions to <mark>climate change</mark>?</P><P>“If companies are just disclosing the risks and opportunities they face and don’t have plans to reduce emissions, support public policy, and develop new products,” says Coburn, “then disclosure in and of itself is not that useful.”</P></DIV><NAV role=""navigation"" id=""5b00010b37dd8"" class=""post-navigation""><H1 class=""screen-reader-text"">Post navigation</H1></NAV></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It’s one of P&amp;G’s largest paper manufacturing operations in the world. The biomass plant also generates electricity for the local utility, Georgia Power.</P><P><STRONG>Biomass is one way to help address <mark>climate change</mark>.</STRONG></P><P>
<mark>Sustainable</mark>, low-<mark>carbon</mark> biomass can provide important sources of renewable energy. It’s free of heat-trapping gases like <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide that contribute to global warming. And it’s economically and socially responsible too. 

The plant’s fuel supply comes from locally sourced biomass that would otherwise have been left to decay, burned, or potentially sent to landfill. This includes discarded treetops, limbs, branches and scrap wood from local forestry operations, crop residuals, such as pecan shells and peanut hulls, and mill waste, such as sawdust.</P><P><STRONG>The leader in competitive energy also leads in renewable, distributed energy.</STRONG></P><P> 
Increasingly, Constellation customers like P&amp;G are looking for innovative ideas that increase energy efficiency, and sustainability – and we deliver. Exelon’s Constellation unit has over 300 megawatts of distributed energy assets in operation or under development. And this project with P&amp;G will help shape the <mark>sustainable</mark> use of biomass energy in its region for years to come.

The project included collaboration with local city, county and state leaders including the Albany-Dougherty Payroll Development Authority, as well as the Georgia Public Service Commission and Georgia Power, which will purchase power at or below avoided cost from Constellation.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""exe-right-rail""><DIV class=""ms-webpart-zone ms-fullWidth""><DIV id=""MSOZoneCell_WebPartWPQ1"" class=""s4-wpcell-plain ms-webpartzone-cell ms-webpart-cell-vertical ms-fullWidth ""><DIV class=""ms-webpart-chrome ms-webpart-chrome-vertical ms-webpart-chrome-fullWidth ""><DIV webpartid=""83325dc9-42a9-4a1d-9420-e324e76bcb34"" haspers=""false"" id=""WebPartWPQ1"" width=""100%"" class=""ms-WPBody noindex "" allowdelete=""false"" style=""""><DIV id=""ctl00_ctl37_g_83325dc9_42a9_4a1d_9420_e324e76bcb34""><DIV class=""ms-webpart-chrome ms-webpart-chrome-fullWidth ""><DIV class=""ms-webpart-chrome-title"" id=""WebPartWPQ3_ChromeTitle""><SPAN title="""" id=""WebPartTitleWPQ3"" class=""js-webpart-titleCell""><H2 style=""text-align:justify;"" class=""ms-webpart-titleText""> </H2></SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SPAN></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

Its products include cleaning agents and personal care products.</P><DIV class=""targets_block""><P><STRONG>The targets</STRONG>
Procter &amp; Gamble commits to reduce emissions from operations 30% by 2020 from a 2010 base-year. Within this timeframe, the company will also address the main source of emissions across its value chain by measures including: ensuring that 70% of all washing machine loads are washed in cold water, doubling the use of post-consumer resin in plastic packaging and ensuring zero deforestation in the palm oil supply chain.</P></DIV><DIV class=""page"" title=""Page 2""><DIV class=""layoutArea""><DIV class=""column""><P><STRONG>Why did you set a science-based target? </STRONG></P><P>The company’s mission is to improve the lives of the world’s consumers now and for generations to come. So pursuing goals in line with those supported by science is a natural step. Aligning our new goal with <mark>climate</mark> science helps ensure the voluntary actions we are taking are meaningful. Science-based targets offer us a credible and meaningful method of communicating these ambitious efforts.</P></DIV><DIV class=""column""><P><STRONG>What was the process?</STRONG></P><P>P&amp;G reviewed the latest science presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) and selected a short-term goal that would enable us to achieve reductions in line with the high end of the range recommended in the latest IPCC report.</P><P>P&amp;G was already committed to sourcing 30% of its energy as renewable, so having a greenhouse gas reduction goal that was equally as ambitious was the next logical step. P&amp;G joined the WWF’s <mark>Climate</mark> Savers program in 2015 and committed to reduce absolute GHG emissions by 30% by 2020 from a 2010 baseline. P&amp;G worked closely with WWF to set this new ambitious science-based goal and their teams confirmed it meets the minimum standards of multiple methods including the 3% solution, SDA and the Context-Based <mark>Carbon</mark> metric approach.</P><DIV class=""page"" title=""Page 3""><DIV class=""layoutArea""><DIV class=""column""><P><STRONG>What are the benefits of having a science-based target? </STRONG></P><P>We set this goal with the rm belief that it will be good for the environment and good for our business. Energy conservation and increasing renewable energy will not only drive emission reductions, but will decrease costs and help create innovative solutions that will help our brands win with consumers.</P><P>There is a clear business case for reducing our greenhouse gas emissions via use of renewable energy and efficiency improvements. For example, the energy efficiency actions we have already taken over the last 4 years, which will help reduce our GHG emissions, have saved $500 million – and there are more savings to come.</P></DIV><DIV class=""column""><P><STRONG>What <mark>innovation</mark>s have occurred as you strive to meet your target? </STRONG></P><P>P&amp;G plans to achieve its new goal by maintaining a focus on energy conservation and increasing its use of renewable energy. The GHG emissions reductions are delivered through P&amp;G’s commitment to sourcing 30% of its energy from renewable sources. The Company’s energy portfolio includes geothermal, wind, solar, hydroelectric, and biomass including renewable projects in North and South America, Asia, and Europe. Nine percent of the 64 million GJ of energy consumed in 2015 was from renewable sources, so achieving 30% might appear difficult; however, with a Texas wind project due in 2016 and a 50 MW biomass CHP project in Albany, Georgia to be delivered in 2017, the 9% will double to about 18% by the end of 2017. Other renewable projects are in development and many more are still being conceptualised.</P><P>In addition to P&amp;G’s ambitious targets to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, the Company has a list of actions to reduce Scope 3 emissions, namely the impact our products have on the environment when used by consumers. The Company plans to make transportation and packaging improvements, achieve zero deforestation in its palm oil supply chain and increase its use of FSC-certified wood fibre. By innovating in washing detergent design, working in partnership with machine manufacturers and raising consumer awareness, P&amp;G aims to increase the proportion of cold-water washes to 70% by 2020. This will help consumers reduce energy usage and contribute to additional reductions in GHG emissions.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

P&amp;G is feeling the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> primarily in the forms of anticipated regulations and social pressure. Despite an impressive plan outlining how to address <mark>climate change</mark> challenges, P&amp;G has been far too slow to adjust its operating processes.</P><P>P&amp;G, the 39<SUP>th</SUP> largest public company in the world,<A href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</A> has a business model that relies heavily on <mark>CO2</mark> emissions. Many of P&amp;G’s supply chain partners provide raw materials that are derived through petroleum-driven processes.<A href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"">[2]</A> Once raw materials are received, hundreds of P&amp;G factories throughout the world burn fossil fuels to produce, package, and deliver goods. Finally, many of the products sold by P&amp;G enable excessive energy use by customers, such as laundry detergents that require only hot water.<A href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"">[3]</A> An operating model heavily reliant on excessive <mark>CO2</mark> emissions coupled with the sheer magnitude of the organization leaves P&amp;G exposed to significant risks associated with <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>In September 2015, <mark>Climate</mark>Counts.org gave P&amp;G a grade of “D” based on <mark>climate change</mark> goals, policy stance, and measurable impacts — the worst grade given in the “household products” industry. <A href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"">[4]</A><EM>InfluenceMap</EM>, a non-profit organization whose goal is to “communicate the extent to which corporations are influencing <mark>climate policy</mark>”, took it a step further and accused P&amp;G of obstructing <mark>climate change</mark> legislation (along with 50 of the world’s 100 largest companies). <A href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"">[5]</A><A href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"">[6]</A>  The P&amp;G website, however, paints a much different picture.</P><P>P&amp;G’s position statement on <mark>climate change</mark> outlines how P&amp;G aims to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) by: (1) creating supply chain partnerships that develop renewable material replacements for petroleum derived materials; (2) developing energy efficiency measures in facilities, transitioning to cleaner alternative fuel sources, and delivering product with energy efficient vehicles; and (3) creating efficient product packaging and educating consumers on energy efficient use of its products.<A href=""#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"">[7]</A> Also, P&amp;G posted “sustainability reports” for every country it operated in dating back to 1999. <A href=""#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"">[8]</A></P><P>Unilever, P&amp;G’s largest competitor, publishes a sustainability strategy that is remarkably similar in concept.<A href=""#_ftn9"" name=""_ftnref9"">[9]</A> This is not surprising, as several organizations publish industry reports that highlight best practices in <mark>climate change</mark>, encouraging industry learning.<A href=""#_ftn10"" name=""_ftnref10"">[10]</A> In comparing hard numbers, however, Unilever and P&amp;G are quite more different. According to the 2015 sustainability reports posted by each company, P&amp;G’s total GHG production was 5,256 metric tons to Unilever’s 1,770.<A href=""#_ftn11"" name=""_ftnref11"">[11]</A> With P&amp;G’s annual production 41% greater than Unilever’s, this is not necessarily surprising. Looking at the <EM>intensity ratio</EM>– total GHG production over total overall production –  P&amp;G is still over double Unilever at 187kg <mark>CO2</mark>/ton compared to 89 kg <mark>CO2</mark>/ton.<A href=""#_ftn12"" name=""_ftnref12"">[12]</A><A href=""#_ftn13"" name=""_ftnref13"">[13]</A> Both in absolute and relative terms, P&amp;G is lagging severely behind.</P><P>Although P&amp;G clearly laid out changes to address <mark>climate change</mark>, it grossly underestimates the pace at which change is necessary. In 2010, P&amp;G set a goal to reduce absolute GHG emissions by 30% before 2020. Five years into this goal the company had only reduced emissions by a measly 4%.<A href=""#_ftn14"" name=""_ftnref14"">[14]</A> Furthermore, only 40% of the company’s environmental goals have a timeline associated with them.<A href=""#_ftn15"" name=""_ftnref15"">[15]</A> For example, one goal states, “Continued progress on [zero manufacturing waste to landfill].”<A href=""#_ftn16"" name=""_ftnref16"">[16]</A> This weak goal setting and lack of tangible progress is a recipe for disaster.</P><P>P&amp;G needs to revise its goals and then hold itself accountable to them. Each goal should be specific, ambitious, measurable, and timeline-oriented. They all require an implementation plan that spans P&amp;G’s worldwide footprint.  Second, accountability has been absent.

Its secret weapon: mushrooms like those in a dormant forest outside Copenhagen.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">In the quest for a more environmentally friendly detergent, two scientists at the company, Novozymes, regularly trudge through the mud, hunting for oyster mushrooms that protrude from a fallen beech or bracken fungi that feast on tough plant fibers. They are studying the enzymes in mushrooms that speed up chemical reactions or natural processes like decay.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“There is a lot going on here, if you know what to look for,” said Mikako Sasa, one of the Novozymes scientists.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Their work is helping the company develop enzymes for laundry and dishwasher detergents that would require less water, or that would work just as effectively at lower temperatures. The energy savings could be significant. Washing machines, for instance, account for over 6 percent of household electricity use in the European Union.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-1bytduc emamhsk0""><DIV class=""css-w71pwo emamhsk2""><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Enlisting enzymes to battle dirt is not a new strategy. Over thousands of years, mushrooms and their fungi cousins have evolved into masters at nourishing themselves on dying trees, fallen branches and other materials.

Procter and Gamble was listed as a member of the following free trade lobby groups:

National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC)
World Economic Forum
Business Roundtable

The investors wrote to Proctor and Gamble and eight others, expressing concern that the companies' declared <mark>climate</mark> policies were undermined by membership of lobby groups with a track record of obstructive lobbying on <mark>climate change</mark> policy. The move came as companies were coming under increasing pressure to withdraw from regressive lobbying groups.
Based on evidence from a publication from the Policy Studies Institute (PSI) at the University of Westminster, the letters highlighted the obstructive lobbying undertaken on behalf of the companies by EU trade associations including Cefic, BusinessEurope and FuelsEurope.
PSI’s research showed how these organisations sought to weaken policies on emissions reductions and renewable energy. The lobbying on <mark>climate policy</mark> that they undertook was often at odds with the more progressive statements on the need for action on <mark>climate change</mark> the companies had publicly made.
Investors signing the letters came from three continents and included: Boston Common Asset Management, AP4 Swedish National Pension Fund, The Pensions Trust, UNISON Staff Pension Scheme, Australian Ethical Investment, Barrow Cadbury, Christopher Reynolds Foundation, The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, Walden Asset Management, Sarasin &amp; Partners LLP, Arjuna Capital, Jesuits in Britain, Zevin Asset Management LLC, Effective Assets, Barrow Cadbury Trust, LankellyChase Foundation, Polden-Puckham Charitable Foundation, The Baring Foundation, Ashden Trust, JJ Charitable Trust, Mark Leonard Trust, Tellus Mater Foundation, Mercy Investment Services Inc. and Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment.</P><SMALL>Share Action www.shareaction.org:Leading investors call on FTSE 100 companies to leave regressive <mark>climate</mark> lobbying groups (2 Septembe</SMALL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

The new members include Johnson &amp; Johnson, Procter &amp; Gamble, Starbucks, Walmart and Goldman Sachs. A handful of the companies have already reached the 100 percent target; others do not expect to do so for several decades, but they are typically setting aggressive interim targets.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">For example, Procter &amp; Gamble, the world’s largest consumer-products company, said it would convert to 30 percent renewable energy by 2020, up from 7 percent today. The new target, a culmination of years of environmental efforts by the company, means that Bounty paper towels, Charmin toilet tissue, Tide detergent and many other goods commonly found in American pantries will increasingly be made with green energy.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-1bytduc emamhsk0""><DIV class=""css-w71pwo emamhsk2""><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“We’ve been very clear that we think <mark>climate change</mark> is something that’s real and needs to be addressed,” Len Sauers, P.&amp;G.’s vice president for global sustainability, said in an interview. “People that use our products expect a company like P.&amp;G. to be responsible.”</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Thousands of corporate leaders, environmental activists and financiers are now gathering in New York for <A class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>weeknyc.org/"" title="""" target=""_blank""><mark>Climate</mark> Week</A>, an annual showcase tied to the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. The gathering is meant to elicit stronger action from companies while putting pressure on governments to step up their own efforts on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">This week’s event comes just ahead of an address to Congress by Pope Francis, who is expected to reiterate his strong stand on the issue, and two months ahead of a meeting in Paris where negotiators will try to strike a broad new global deal to limit the emissions causing the planet to warm.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Companies have realized that cutting their energy use can save money. But they are also under pressure from consumers, particularly younger ones, to take action, and many companies have begun to see their environmental efforts as a core part of their business strategy.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">The efforts include less overall use of energy and water, more recycling, more use of renewable energy, and a wave of promises to improve the supply chains for commodities like soybeans, palm oil and beef. These are often produced in the tropics, creating powerful financial incentives to chop down forests, which not only contributes to global warming but destroys some the world’s richest biological regions.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-1bytduc emamhsk0""><DIV class=""css-w71pwo emamhsk2""><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Two commodity companies, Bunge, of White Plains, N.Y., and Astra Agro Lestari, of Indonesia, announced strong policies in recent days meant to reduce deforestation. Glenn Hurowitz, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, a Washington think tank, described the Astra announcement as especially significant, given the palm oil company’s political influence in Indonesia, a country that has seen rampant deforestation in recent years.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">However, Mr. Hurowitz and several other environmental advocates strongly criticized another company, Cargill, of Minnetonka, Minn. That giant commodity processor had signed a declaration in New York a year ago that committed many commodity firms to help end deforestation globally by 2020, yet a recent policy from Cargill does not commit to ending it entirely before 2030.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“Cargill is being left in the dust by its competitors in the race to provide environmentally responsible products to customers who demand them,” Mr. Hurowitz said.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-1bytduc emamhsk0""><DIV class=""css-w71pwo emamhsk2""><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">A Cargill spokesman, Chris Schraeder, rejected the criticism and said Cargill was working as hard as possible to halt deforestation in its supply chain. “We believe our global policy is more extensive than anything else in our industry and we have action plans to show how we’re getting to our no-deforestation goal,” Mr. Schraeder said in a statement.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Many <mark>climate</mark> activists are working to persuade pension funds, universities, churches and other groups that hold endowments to divest from fossil fuel stocks. The activists blame the major fossil companies for blocking strong political action on emissions.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">The demand to divest first arose several years ago on college campuses. A year ago, the assets under management by organizations that had pledged to divest totaled about $50 billion.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">On Tuesday, Arabella Advisors, a firm focused on socially responsible finance, reported that the sum had grown to $2.6 trillion, a measure of the movement’s rapid spread and its success at convincing Wall Street money managers that fossil fuel stocks may be a risky long-term investment.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-1bytduc emamhsk0""><DIV class=""css-w71pwo emamhsk2""><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“That’s real money,” said Ellen Dorsey, executive director of the Wallace Global Fund, a charity that has backed divestment and that commissioned the Arabella report.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Organizations committed to some form of divestment now include some of the world’s major pension funds and other large pools of investment capital. The latest to divest, on Tuesday, was the charitable foundation created by the actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who has long been active in environmental causes.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">While the managers committing to divest may oversee $2.6 trillion of investments, it is not clear how much of that money is actually parked in fossil fuel stocks. While the sum is almost certainly in the tens of billions, the exact amount is essentially impossible to track since the investment positions of large money managers tend to change by the day.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Nor is it clear whether the divestment campaign is putting downward pressure on share prices. Almost all the fossil fuel stocks are down, some drastically, over the last few years with weakening global demand for coal, as well as oil production so robust it has saturated the market.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">At a news conference on Tuesday, <mark>climate</mark> activists pointed out that universities rejecting divestment, as many have done, would probably have avoided substantial investment losses over the last few years if they had heeded their own students.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“I invite you to stand with students, or get out of the way,” said Alden Phinney, a student divestment activist from the University of California, Santa Cruz. </P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">In a briefing on Tuesday, leaders of the American Petroleum Institute criticized the divestment campaign as unrealistic, and released a report stating that their industry is helping to finance technologies that reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. “There are those who would advocate for no fossil fuels at all, which is frankly irresponsible, since the United States depends on fossil fuels to meet 80 percent of its energy needs,” said Jack N. Gerard, president of the petroleum institute.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-1bytduc emamhsk0""><DIV class=""css-w71pwo emamhsk2""><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">One coal company, Peabody Energy, has begun warning investors that the divestment campaign could be a material risk to its business. But most fossil fuel companies are not offering any such warning.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">In fact, though the companies have discovered several times more reserves of fossil fuels than scientists say the world can safely afford to burn, they are spending several hundred billion dollars a year looking for additional coal, oil and natural gas.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""bottom-of-article""><DIV class=""PrintInformation-printInformation--2_6hD"">A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Global Companies Joining <mark>Climate Change</mark> Efforts <SPAN>. <A href=""http://www.nytreprints.com/"">Order Reprints</A> | <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html"">Today’s Paper</A> | <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY"">Subscribe</A></SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""RelatedCoverage-relatedcoverage--LmkKX""><HEADER class=""RelatedCoverage-sectionHeader--TT9ds""><H3 class=""RelatedCoverage-sectionHeading--2zJtL"">Related Coverage</H3></HEADER></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

One day in early March at about 1:00 p.m., a woman wearing conservative business attire and toting a wheeled bag strolled through the front entrance of Procter &amp; Gamble's 17-story headquarters in downtown Cincinnati. She told security she had an appointment, possibly with one of the businesses that rent space in the building, and was waved inside. </P><P> But she never arrived at the office. There was no appointment. </P><P> Instead, the woman made her way to an emergency exit door and pushed it open. Eight associates, all pulling bags of their own, swept in and disappeared into a crowd of arriving employees. </P><P> Though they too wore business suits and what looked like P&amp;G employee badges, they didn't work for the consumer-goods giant. They were from Greenpeace, and they'd come to save tigers. </P><P> Wordlessly, the nine activists made their way past the security desk and headed for two rendezvous points — one, in a 12th-floor office suite in the iconic building's north tower, the second, in an office just opposite, in the east tower. There, the two groups jimmied open several windows, attached rappelling gear to the window-washing stanchions, and climbed out into the chilly air. </P><P> After a zip line was strung between the two towers and secured, the smallest member of the team, 20-year-old Denise Rodriguez, of Queens, New York, edged out onto the wire, shimmied to center point, then dangled there in the gentle breeze, 70 feet in the air. She was wearing a tiger costume. </P><P> Her colleagues unfurled a pair of 60-foot-tall banners on the front of each tower. The banners denounced Head &amp; Shoulders, the antidandruff shampoo, for &quot;putting tiger survival on the line&quot; and &quot;wip[ing] out dandruff &amp; rainforests.&quot; </P><P> A rented helicopter hovered overhead as a videographer and photographer captured the unfolding drama. </P><P> Arriving on the scene, Capt. Paul Broxterman of the Cincinnati police found the windows had been braced shut from the outside. He knocked on the glass and got one of the activists to call him on his cellphone. </P><P> &quot;How long are you guys going to be out there?&quot; he asked.                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> &quot;We'll be wrapping up shortly,&quot; came the reply. </P><P><FIGURE id=""img-634351"" class=""figure image-figure-image  postload"" data-type=""img"" data-e2e-name=""image-figure-image"" data-media-container=""image"" style=""""><SPAN class=""image-source-caption""><FIGCAPTION class=""image-caption"" data-e2e-name=""image-caption"">Greenpeace's action at P&amp;G's Cincinnati headquarters in April. </FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""image-source"" data-e2e-name=""image-source"">

The incursion, which left P&amp;G's vaunted corporate security force looking uncharacteristically flat-footed, was the latest foray in Greenpeace's seven-year campaign against the use of improperly sourced palm oil. A highly saturated vegetable fat derived from the fruit, or sometimes the kernel, of the oil palm, it is, in and of itself, a relatively innocuous substance, a common ingredient in everything from laundry detergent and cosmetics to candy bars and ice cream. In recent years, demand has spiked because of its popularity as a replacement for hydrogenated oils and as a source of biodiesel fuel, which, paradoxically, is often promoted as an environmentally sound alternative to fossil fuels. </P><P> The problem — what elevated this viscous wonder elixir to the top of Greenpeace's global agenda — is the aggressive manner in which the world's biggest palm-oil producers, based in Indonesia, have gone about meeting demand: burning and clear-cutting the nation's priceless tropical peat forests to the ground, then draining the underlying wetlands to make way for massive oil-palm plantations. </P><P> As Greenpeace's banners made clear, that deforestation is destroying the habitat of the Sumatran tiger, of which there are said to be fewer than 400 left. Also threatened are orangutans, rhinos, elephants, and about 114 bird species. </P><P> But truth be told, the animals are really beside the point.                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> Greenpeace's tigers are a kind of decoy, a sleek feline metaphor pressed into service on behalf of the broader existential threat that we all face because of the warming of the atmosphere. </P><P> It turns out that the results of Indonesian deforestation go far beyond decimating tiger habitats. The critical issue is not even the jungle itself exactly, but the swampy peatlands from which it rises — massive watery bogs up to 50 feet deep containing layer upon layer of fallen vegetal debris. </P><P> This peat acts as an immense living storage locker for <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, and as the peatlands are drained, the plant matter decomposes, releasing greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere at a truly frightening rate. By one estimate, the amount of <mark>carbon</mark> given off because of deforestation in Indonesia accounts for a whopping 4% of global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions — from just .1% of the earth's land surface. </P><P> Of course that's a lot of information to fit on one banner. The tiger is convenient shorthand. </P><P> &quot;It's easy to say, 'If you're destroying forests, you're destroying tiger habitats,'&quot; says Phil Radford, the outgoing executive director of Greenpeace USA (his replacement, Annie Leonard, was <A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/viral-video-environment-executive-director-greenpeace-2014-5""> announced</A> in April). &quot;It's harder to say, 'Do you know that forests store <mark>carbon</mark> and if we save the peat bogs we will trap all this <mark>carbon</mark> and methane in the soil?' We say both, but we start with the place that people are, the thing they care about the most first.&quot;                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> Says his colleague Nicky Davies, the organization's campaigns director: &quot;We're not going to win by telling people what they should care about. And winning is the objective.&quot; </P><P> Greenpeace's strategy, which it calls &quot;market-based campaigning,&quot; has proved devastatingly effective. It goes like this: Pick an area of concern. Identify on-the-ground producers whose actions are contributing to the problem. Follow the supply chain to a multinational corporation that peddles a widely known consumer product. Send an email or two, kindly pointing out the company's &quot;exposure&quot; and suggesting an alternative. Ask again, firmly but pleasantly. Issue a sober, meticulously researched public report. If the desired response is not forthcoming. roll out a clear, multipronged media campaign, ideally starring a beloved animal species and featuring a hashtag. Climb a building or two. </P><P> What seems to happen, inevitably, is the multinational company, eager to remove the stigma from its signature brand, promises to ensure that its products are <mark>sustainable</mark> and begins cancelling contracts with any third-party suppliers who fail to guarantee compliance. In order to retain the multinational's lucrative business, the largest suppliers fall into line. Before long, as the cascade effect grows, they begin eyeing their wayward rivals, companies that are still operating in flagrant violation of the new rules and undercutting them with other customers. Eventually, broad new industry protocols are adopted to level the playing field. </P><P> Rinse, repeat. </P><H2> Sailing to Amchitka </H2><P> They thought of themselves as Hobbits, embarking on a journey to Mordor. Or some did, anyway. The founders of Greenpeace didn't agree on much. As cofounder Bob Hunter wrote, &quot;We spent most of our time at each other's throats, egos clashing.&quot; </P><P><FIGURE id=""img-279862"" class=""figure image-figure-image  postload"" data-type=""img"" data-e2e-name=""image-figure-image"" data-media-container=""image"" style=""""><SPAN class=""image-source-caption""><FIGCAPTION class=""image-caption"" data-e2e-name=""image-caption"">Bob Hunter on the original Greenpeace voyage in 1971.</FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""image-source"" data-e2e-name=""image-source"">

Emerging from the acid-laced Vancouver hippie scene, the cadre of activists who gave birth to the group were a loose confederacy of draft-dodgers, radicals, mind-expansion mystics, tree-huggers, former beatniks, and Quakers, in addition to a few Hobbit heads like Hunter. </P><P> In 1971, after reports surfaced of a planned underground nuclear test on the island of Amchitka, on the far western point of Alaska's Aleutian Islands, a dozen of them chartered a fishing boat, a halibut trawler called the Phyllis Cormack, temporarily rechristened it the Greenpeace, and set sail from Vancouver hell-bent on thwarting the U.S. military.                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> A few days after they left Victoria Harbor, cowboy icon John Wayne arrived in Vancouver on his private yacht, a retrofitted World War II minesweeper. The star was asked what he thought of the protesters. </P><P> &quot;They're a bunch of commies,&quot; he said. &quot;Canadians should mind their own business.&quot; </P><P> A few days later, the group was turned back by the U.S. Coast Guard, and the nuclear test was carried out as planned. But the audacious voyage received worldwide media attention and ignited a firestorm of opposition, leading the U.S. government to abandon its plans for future tests on the island, which eventually became a bird sanctuary. </P><P> If the incident proved anything, it was the power of mythmaking and what we now call optics. (It's worth noting that several Greenpeace founders were fans of media-theory rock star Marshall McLuhan.) The framing of the story — scruffy, daredevil ecowarriors risk their lives in a brave if hopeless stand against the most powerful military in the world — resonated deeply, and the David and Goliath dynamic became the cornerstone of Greenpeace's identity. Nearly 45 years on, it still works. </P><P> In the years that followed, the group expanded its goals, taking on commercial whaling, the dumping of toxic and nuclear waste, seal hunting, arctic drilling, drift-net fishing, PVCs, GMOs, HFCs, and a number of other afflictions, all reasonable objectives, which in retrospect look like dress rehearsals for the big show: the increasingly urgent effort to slow the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, a threat that was scarcely understood when the group first set off for western Alaska.                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> Greenpeace's confrontational and swashbuckling approach has helped make it one the world's <A href=""http://observer.com/2011/12/wwd-writer-fire-fiend-peter-braunstein-12132011/#axzz31cioAPP0""> most powerful environmental NGOs</A>, with branches in 41 countries, 2.9 million donors and more than $350 million in annual contributions. </P><P> But increasingly, the organization has begun to temper its intensity with a cool-eyed and disciplined pragmatism, resulting in a string of extraordinary victories. On deforestation, a variety of companies, including big suppliers such as Asia Pulp &amp; Paper and manufacturers like Kimberly-Clark, have been joined by Mattel, Nike, McDonald's, Yum Brands, Unilever, Ferraro, Coca-Cola, Mondelez, and Nestlé in pledging to end the clear-cutting of precious rain forests. Tech giants like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Salesforce have promised to power their data centers with renewable energy, a pledge that led Duke Energy, the nation's largest power utility and one of the most flagrant emitters of <mark>CO2</mark>, to begin providing clean energy to win their business. And grocers like Wal-Mart, Safeway, Whole Foods, and Trader Joe's have begun selling <mark>sustainable</mark> seafood. </P><P><A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NbsVwzTb_A"">YouTube</A></P></DIV></SECTION>Greenpeace's achievements have not been accomplished without help. Many have been undertaken in partnership with other environmental NGOs, from the World Wildlife Fund to the Rainforest Alliance, which are also doing important work. And organizations like the Sierra Club and NRDC are <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/us/politics/environmental-groups-focus-on-change-by-strengthening-their-political-operations.html?_r=0""> doubling down on political activism</A> on the global-warming front. <P> But when it comes to catalyzing change in the corporate arena, Greenpeace seems to have cracked the code in a way that offers some important lessons for other advocacy groups. </P><P> Corporate representatives who have sat across the table from Greenpeace give the group's negotiators high marks for professionalism. &quot;They've been very trustworthy,&quot; says Bill Weihl, manager of energy efficiency and sustainability at Facebook. &quot;Certainly, when they first started, it was adversarial, but fairly quickly it turned into a productive conversation.&quot;                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> Aida Greenbury, managing director for sustainability at Asia Pulp &amp; Paper, calls Greenpeace &quot;one of the very, very few NGOs I fully respect, because the people behind it really believe in what they are fighting for. We trust they are helping us achieve what we both want to achieve.&quot; </P><P> &quot;They are real subject-matter experts,&quot; says Suhas Apte, former vice president of sustainability for Kimberly-Clark, the paper-goods giant. The company, which produces Kleenex, has made an astonishing turnaround — from clear-cutting ne'er-do-well to sustainability poster child — since being targeted by Greenpeace beginning a decade ago. &quot;They obviously have a vested interest,&quot; Apte adds, &quot;but at the same time, they are very pragmatic and practical people, and as long as you are willing to listen, their whole intention is to see a change happen.&quot; </P><P> &quot;NGOs have become very businesslike,&quot; says a sustainability officer for a major media company, who spoke on condition of anonymity. &quot;They're thinking through the strategy and creating an integrated campaign just like a company would when marketing a product, going through the R&amp;D phase, the development phase, production, and then the retail channels. It's a corporate approach.&quot; </P><P> Meanwhile, unlike several other environmental groups, including the World Wildlife Fund, the Sierra Club, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Audubon Society, Conservation International, and the Nature Conservancy, Greenpeace does not accept corporate or government funds. &quot;We don't have anything for sale,&quot; Rolf Skar, Greenpeace's forests campaign director, points out. &quot;There's no green stamp of approval you can pay for. You can't pay us to set up a park. We're not going to act as paid consultants to help you clean up your supply chain.&quot; </P><P> &quot;It's what I like most about them, to be honest,&quot; Apte says. &quot;Most other environmental NGOs are looking for some sort of partnership where you put some money in. Greenpeace doesn't do that. In that sense they are unbiased and open-minded.&quot; </P><H2> Lessons From The Great Bear </H2><P> During the summer of 1993, the usually tranquil Clayoquot Sound along the western coast of Vancouver Island became the site of a mass protest by indigenous First Nations communities and their supporters. Timber companies were aggressively clear-cutting the area's temperate rain forest, with the eager support of the provincial government. As supporters began trekking to the site from Vancouver to participate in daily blockades of a remote logging road, the protest grew into the largest act of civil disobedience in Canadian history. The battle, which lasted throughout the summer, led to more than 900 arrests and no shortage of media coverage.                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> And then, effectively, nothing. </P><P> It wasn't until a coalition of environmental groups began applying pressure to the loggers' customers — who themselves sold retail goods to consumers — that the situation began to turn around. </P><P> Greenpeace targeted Home Depot, labeling the company the &quot;world's largest retailer of wood products from ancient forests.&quot; Home Depot quickly began leaning on its suppliers. As pressure grew, the British Columbian government began to shift its stance as well, resulting in historic agreements to preserve more than 50% of the surrounding central and north coastal regions — which the environmental groups had cannily renamed the Great Bear Rainforest. It was one of the group's biggest wins, and it became a template for future campaigns. </P><P><FIGURE id=""img-860876"" class=""figure image-figure-image  postload"" data-type=""img"" data-e2e-name=""image-figure-image"" data-media-container=""image"" style=""""><SPAN class=""image-source-caption""><FIGCAPTION class=""image-caption"" data-e2e-name=""image-caption"">The Great Bear Rainforest battle became the template for future campaigns.</FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""image-source"" data-e2e-name=""image-source"">

                                    </SPAN></SPAN></FIGURE> &quot;What we learned from that is it was unrealistic to expect government to take the lead,&quot; Skar says. &quot;In order for government to reform land use, generally they need some sort of consensus. And we couldn't go straight to the large logging companies and tell them to do something different. We had no leverage. But we could tell the Home Depots of the world that their most important assets, their brands, could be affected easily by our campaigns as long as we had our facts right.&quot; </P><P> Tracing the various components of a given product through a complex supply chain can be a complex task, even for the offending companies themselves.                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> To ensure its reports are accurate, Greenpeace employs 100 full-time staffers around the world in its research and intelligence units, including satellite imagery and mapping experts, as well as reconnaissance teams who can track a shipment of goods to its source. Often, damning evidence can be uncovered through a careful analysis of the public record. In other cases, corporate whistleblowers tip off the organization to violations. </P><P> When Greenpeace went after Kimberly-Clark for using virgin forests to manufacture its paper products, the company reacted defensively, convinced its practices were environmentally sound. &quot;We thought we were very progressive,&quot; Apte recalls. &quot;But the magic is in the details, and Greenpeace found out that one of the third parties we were relying on was not getting wood from the right source.&quot; </P><P> Whatever a company's market capitalization or lobbying mojo, its consumer-facing brands represent a soft, sensitive underbelly. Kimberly-Clark, an enormous player in the paper-goods industry, produces Cottonelle, Scott Tissues, and Huggies, among other brands. But Kleenex is its largest brand by far, marketed in more than 20 countries. After outlining its concerns, to little effect, Greenpeace launched the &quot;Kleercut&quot; campaign, tweaking the tissue's familiar cursive logo, in 2004. The publicity effort went on for years. Activists decorated trucks as tissue boxes and parked them outside corporate headquarters. They printed a doctored version of USA Today and distributed it at the World Tissue Convention. They infiltrated shareholders' meetings. They launched a group called the Forest Friendly 500, urging universities, companies, and other major purchasers to boycott Kimberly-Clark's products. They blockaded mills and chained themselves to train tracks. They pranked a man-on-the-street shoot for a Kleenex spot, sending activists one by one to pose as passersby and denounce the tissue as cameras rolled, then they released their own <A href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aar_6wDGr0Y"">video</A> of what happened. At one point, as Kimberly-Clark CEO Thomas Falk prepared to deliver a speech at his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin, activists managed to access the audiovisual equipment, swapping out his PowerPoint deck for slides focused on the Kleercut campaign. </P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blockquote  pullquote""> It gets to the point where the CEO says, I'd like this to go away. </BLOCKQUOTE><P> A flustered Falk cut the talk short, and guests were ushered into a luncheon, where they were greeted at their table settings with satirical menus further hammering home Greenpeace's message. </P><P> Economically, the effect of all this was negligible, but that wasn't the point. &quot;The nuisance impact was much larger,&quot; Apte says. In 2009, when he came in as vice president of global sustainability, ready to engage with Greenpeace, some colleagues were dubious. &quot;There were a lot of skeptics and nonbelievers who had been dealing with it since 2004,&quot; he recalls. &quot;But it gets to the point where the CEO says, 'I understand that we have a very progressive policy, but I'd like this to go away.'&quot;                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> Before long, Kimberly-Clark toughened its procurement guidelines based on Greenpeace's recommendations, a shift the two sides announced at a joint news conference in August 2009. </P><P> Of course, the success of this technique depends on a company's susceptibility to public pressure. When it came to Asia Pulp &amp; Paper, a large multinational unknown to most consumers, Greenpeace simply looked downstream to find a purchaser of the company's paper that might be more concerned about its brand image. It chose Mattel — specifically, one of the company's most iconic toys, Barbie — which was being packaged with cardboard traced to virgin forests. (The campaign, called &quot;<A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3MT71Vy8_s"">Barbie, It's Over</A>,&quot; portrayed Ken, Barbie's longtime beau, kicking her to the curb because, as he put it, &quot;I don't date girls who are into deforestation.&quot;) </P><P><A href=""https://vimeo.com/25832441"">Vimeo</A></P></ARTICLE><P> Mattel soon reached out to APP, and while it was a relatively small customer, the paper company got the message. &quot;It was not about tonnage for us,&quot; Aida Greenbury says. &quot;But it really affected peoples' perception of APP. That campaign was very effective.&quot;                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> APP soon opened negotiations with Greenpeace, though not without some hesitation. &quot;It wasn't love at first sight, that's for sure,&quot; Greenbury says. &quot;It was very tough, especially for an Asian company, to receive such blunt and harsh criticism. When we first met them, the trust level was not even zero — it was probably minus 50. It was hard to give internal information to a radical NGO. 'Are they going to use it against us?' But they didn't. They used it to help us, and we built up trust. It was an interesting journey.&quot; </P><P> Last year, APP launched an impressive zero-deforestation plan, which has had profound ripple effects. &quot;The impact of our conservation policy is not only on our concessions,&quot; Greenbury points out. &quot;It's on all suppliers entering our supply chain. We think it's our obligation to help our suppliers be able to comply with our policy. So it's quite huge.&quot; </P><P> Recently, APP took the issue a step further, announcing a plan not merely to end clear-cutting but to restore 1 million hectares of rain forest. </P><H2> Greenpeace's Civil War </H2><P> Greenpeace's transformation into a high-performance industrial spanking machine was only accomplished after a bloody executive putsch — the sort of boardroom intrigue more commonly encountered among pinstriped Masters of the Universe than Birkenstock-wearing idealists. </P><P><A href=""https://vimeo.com/13205971"" target=""_blank""><FIGURE id=""img-56702"" class=""figure image-figure-image  postload"" data-type=""img"" data-e2e-name=""image-figure-image"" data-media-container=""image"" style=""""><SPAN class=""image-source-caption""><SPAN class=""image-source"" data-e2e-name=""image-source"">

The conflict, which pitted the central office in Amsterdam, backed by the European national groups, against the American affiliate, Greenpeace USA, boiled down to this: Encouraged by the ascendancy of Green parties in Germany and elsewhere, the European contingent was ready to grow up, join the establishment and work for change from the inside. Past efforts along these lines had already shown promise. A few years before, a staffer in Germany had worked with a scientist to pioneer a clean new refrigeration technology, dubbed <A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/global-warming-and-energy/green-solutions/greenfreeze/""> Greenfreeze</A>, which had since been widely adopted throughout Europe and Asia, resulting in a massive decline in the release of hydrofluoro<mark>carbon</mark>s. </P><P> The Europeans remained proponents of direct action, but only as part of a multipronged effort that also included &quot;solutions work,&quot; such as developing feasible alternatives to un<mark>sustainable</mark> practices, and opening negotiations with corporate adversaries. They were also eager for the NGO's many semiautonomous satellite offices to coordinate their efforts around large-scale, global issues such as <mark>climate change</mark> and GMOs.                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> The Americans were still in protest mode, putting their efforts into local battles and community building in a bid to jump-start a broad social movement. </P><P> They were dedicated activists on both sides, all zealous do-gooders. But the philosophical gap soon became unbridgeable. And there was another problem. The sprawling network was governed by a longstanding arrangement by which the national groups based in rich countries paid annual dues to the home office in Amsterdam, which used the funds to support less wealthy satellites in the developing world. </P><P> The setup worked well, but a wrinkle had emerged: Greenpeace USA was going broke. </P><P> The effort to build a grassroots movement based on retail canvassing and coalition building had taken a toll on the American group's public profile. As a result, its fundraising tanked. </P><P> Although the localized approach led to some important wins — for instance, curtailing the dumping of toxins in Louisiana's &quot;Cancer Alley&quot; — they came at the expense of the global organization's key priorities. For instance, Greenpeace USA was missing in action during the negotiations over the Kyoto Protocols, essentially declining to participate. And it opted out of the GMO campaign, which was gathering steam around the world. Membership and donations plummeted by more than 60%. As a result, levies paid to the central office slowed to a trickle.                                                               </P><P> Eventually, acting on a clause in the bylaws, international body <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/16/us/downsizing-activism-greenpeace-is-cutting-back.html""> took aggressive action</A>, dismissing Greenpeace USA's executive director and parachuting in a replacement in from Amsterdam with a mandate to clean house. </P><P> The acting director laid off 335 staff members out of a total of 400 (mostly door-to-door canvassers) and slashed the annual budget by more than 25%. The board of directors was sent packing. </P><P> After a period of soul-searching, the U.S. group signed on the global agenda, retooled its operations and replaced the expensive canvassing efforts with an expanded online presence. Eventually, the organization began to notch some wins — on GMOs, for instance, and the use of toxic chemicals in children's toys — which began to reduce internal tensions. Membership rolls bounced back and the money started flowing again. </P><H2> Giving Up On Government </H2><P> Greenpeace's energetic crusade to turn corporate transgressors into eco-champions came about in response to a sudden realization that the traditional approach, pushing for government regulation, had become a spectacular failure. </P><P> &quot;A lot of NGOs working on deforestation had a bit of a pipe dream that some sort of U.N. <mark>climate</mark> treaty or U.S. law, cap and trade or something, would save the day,&quot; says Rolf Skar. &quot;The disappointment that was Copenhagen&quot; — the 2009 U.N. <mark>climate</mark> summit widely regarded as a bust — &quot;left a lot of us scratching our heads about what to we could go next.&quot; </P><P><FIGURE id=""img-328094"" class=""figure image-figure-image  postload"" data-type=""img"" data-e2e-name=""image-figure-image"" data-media-container=""image"" style=""""><SPAN class=""image-source-caption""><FIGCAPTION class=""image-caption"" data-e2e-name=""image-caption"">An ad parody dinging Apple for using coal power.

In the U.S., the inertia around environmental issues can be attributed to the paralysis of a divided and acrimonious legislative branch. As Radford points out, &quot;There hasn't been real national environmental legislation passed since Superfund in the 1980s.&quot; The Clean Air Act, he notes, was technically an extension, and recent moves on green issues — like the tough new fuel standards — have come from the executive branch without congressional action. </P><P> &quot;The old equation for environmental groups was help write a bill and get Congress to pass it, or pass state laws and then press for consistency,&quot; Radford says. But now, the outsize influence of ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council, which aggressively promotes conservative policies in statehouses and municipalities, has come to dominate local politics. &quot;And gerrymandering and voter suppression have made it hard to do much in Congress,&quot; he says.                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> That's to say nothing of the <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/20/conservative-groups-1bn-against-<mark>climate</mark>-change""> estimated $1 billion</A> that conservative groups spend annually to fund <mark>climate</mark>-change skeptics, think tanks, and advocacy organizations. </P><P> Apte puts it more bluntly. &quot;I don't believe our legislators will adopt any action on <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; he says. &quot;Unfortunately, there are some politicians who are naive about the whole issue, and so much money is put behind those candidates that I doubt Congress will ever act.&quot; </P><P> In many of the key countries where Greenpeace operates, authoritarian regimes and rampant corruption can create further difficulties. </P><P> &quot;What we've come to learn from Indonesia and other countries that are incredibly corrupt, is if you can flip enough companies, then civil societies and the companies together can get laws passed,&quot; Radford says. </P><P> He points to the example of ranchers in Brazil who were aggressively clearing forests to create more grazing lands. Some 75% of the beef was consumed locally, and the national government had a financial stake in the large beef processors, so Greenpeace's leverage seemed minimal. But it turned out the leather was going to Nike, Timberland, and BMW. The group initiated campaigns against those brands instead. &quot;It was real easy to get the attention of the cattle industry when those companies got on the horn and said, 'We've got a problem here,'&quot; Skar recalls. Before long, the beef producers <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/world/americas/07deforest.html?_r=0""> came around</A>, working with Greenpeace to adopt strict new policies against deforestation, without the Brazilian government's input.                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> There are other reasons for this indirect approach. Greenpeace's scuffles with governments have proved dangerous. In 1973, Dave McTaggart, who would become the group's chairman, lost sight in one eye during a scuffle with French commandos after he tried to prevent a nuclear test in the South Pacific. More than a decade later, French intelligence agents bombed the Greenpeace ship, the Rainbow Warrior, which was attempting to prevent similar tests. A photographer was killed in the explosion, and the vessel was sunk. French officials initially denied involvement in the bombing, but the plot was uncovered by New Zealand police. </P><P> In the Amazon, death threats are so routine that activists wear Kevlar vests and travel in armored trucks. Greenpeace Brazil campaigner Paolo Adario, who often uses a small plane to identify clear-cutting in remote regions, has found himself unable to land at certain airstrips because of angry mobs waiting for him. Campaigners have been hung in effigy in Indonesia, and the Rainbow Warrior II was chased through international waters not long ago by an Indonesian destroyer and warplanes. Just last year, a Greenpeace ship protesting drilling in the Arctic was attacked by armed Russian commandos, who arrested the crew. The activists, called the Arctic 30, were charged with piracy, a crime carrying a 15-year sentence, before being released as part Vladimir Putin's pre-Olympics amnesty. </P><P> By contrast, dealing with multinational corporations is a walk in the park. &quot;Companies tend not to show up with automatic rifles and start shooting inches above your head,&quot; Skar observers, referring to the aggressive tactics employed by the Russian military in the arctic standoff. &quot;We're nonviolent,&quot; he says. &quot;We're not going to fight back.&quot; </P><P> Moreover, corporations tend to be motivated not by ideology but by revenue, and are therefore less likely to question the hard science behind global warming. Notable exceptions include industry titans like Charles and David Koch, who profit directly from fossil fuels. </P><P> Tech companies especially have shown an awareness of the dangers posed by <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, perhaps because they are staffed and often run by young engineers and scientists. &quot;One thing about working with the IT sector,&quot; says Gary Cook, Greenpeace's senior IT analyst, &quot;is we have never had a debate about <mark>climate change</mark>. They all think it's real.&quot;                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> That helps explain why Greenpeace's campaign to persuade major tech companies — most notably Google, Facebook, and Apple — to power their data centers with renewable energy has been so successful. After being slammed in Greenpeace's 2012 report &quot;How Clean Is Your Cloud?&quot; Apple has since earned praise for committing to using 100% renewable energy to power its iCloud server farms. It even installed solar arrays at its facility in Maiden, North Carolina, rather than tap into the coal-generated power provided by the local utility, Duke Energy. </P><P> &quot;The fact that Apple went and did that told Duke that if it sits on its hands, motivated companies can go around them,&quot; Cook says. &quot;Other commercial customers started to say, 'Hmm, maybe we should look at this, too.' Duke doesn't make any money if companies generate their own power.&quot; Before long, pressure from Apple, as well as Google and Facebook, persuaded Duke to create a program offering green power to major corporate customers rather than lose their business altogether. &quot;Duke never would have done that on its own,&quot; Phil Radford says. </P><P> One tech company that has steadfastly resisted Greenpeace's entreaties is Amazon Web Services, the world's leading hosting company and one of the sector's <A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/greenpeace-cloud-computing-report-2014-4""> largest users of fossil fuels</A>, according to Greenpeace. &quot;I'm an optimist about them,&quot; Cook says. &quot;If motivated, I feel confident Amazon will find a way to move at significant scale. But at this point, there's no indication that they're going to do that.&quot; Seeking a more vulnerable pressure point, the group recently launched a campaign against Pinterest, a major AWS client, demanding the company &quot;<A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/media-center/news-releases/Greenpeace-Top-Users-Ask-Pinterest-to-Go-Green-on-Oversized-Pinboards-at-Company-HQ/"">Make Our Pins Green</A>&quot; and enlisting some of Pinterest's most widely followed users in the effort. (Disclosure: Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider.) </P><P><FIGURE id=""img-209085"" class=""figure image-figure-image  postload"" data-type=""img"" data-e2e-name=""image-figure-image"" data-media-container=""image"" style=""""><SPAN class=""image-source-caption""><FIGCAPTION class=""image-caption"" data-e2e-name=""image-caption"">A clip from Greenpeace's &quot;Unfriend Coal&quot; campaign against Facebook.

One key reason for the shift in thinking in corporate boardrooms is globalization. Most large companies now operate across borders — often with offices, factories, licensees, and suppliers in some of the areas most directly affected by <mark>climate change</mark> — and are therefore more likely to experience the effects directly. </P><P> Apte points to the massive floods that swept Thailand in 2011. Because major automakers depended on parts manufactured in Thailand, <A href=""http://www.ihs.com/products/global-insight/industry-economic-report.aspx?id=1065931666""> assembly lines went idle</A> around the world.                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> &quot;If you were to ask some guy in the auto industry five years ago, 'Do you believe in global warming?' he would have said no,&quot; Apte says, &quot;but more and more, people are coming to the realization that <mark>climate change</mark> is having a big impact on supply chains. Business leaders are smart enough to see what is happening. Ask them about economic impacts, and the amount of money each company is losing has gone up tenfold.&quot; </P><P> The other key factor for businesses is a heightened sensitivity to the value of their signature brands, often built over many years at considerable cost. The decades-old practice of &quot;culture jamming&quot; — what the French Situationists who pioneered the technique called &quot;détournement&quot; — has been weaponized by social media, enabling organizations to use a company's own elaborately planned marketing campaigns against it, often to devastating effect. </P><P> &quot;Companies invest a lot in advertising and building relationships with consumers, and it's really easy for us to mess that up,&quot; Skar says. &quot;We can outperform many companies online with the right issues —more hits, more likes, more views. That's really increased our power.&quot; </P><H2> 'Fuzzier, Wuzzier, Greener' </H2><P> Even Greenpeace's detractors have taken note of the organization's newfound potency. Fred Smith, former president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) and founder of the group's Center for Advancing Capitalism, calls Greenpeace &quot;one of the most effective&quot; groups out there at essentially guilt-tripping corporations into becoming more socially responsible, a trend he considers hopelessly misguided. &quot;It's bad for companies, bad for customers, bad for shareholders, bad for workers,&quot; Smith says. &quot;But boy, it can get CEOs really great publicity in newspapers. Their wife can come home from the garden club and say, 'Dear, you're so much better than the other corporate husbands I know!' And their children can say, 'Daddy, you're not as evil as I thought you were all these years!'&quot; </P><P><FIGURE id=""img-295620"" class=""figure image-figure-image image-figure-float-right float-md-right postload"" data-type=""img"" data-e2e-name=""image-figure-image"" data-media-container=""image"" style=""""><SPAN class=""image-source-caption""><FIGCAPTION class=""image-caption"" data-e2e-name=""image-caption"">Fred Smith, founder of the Center for Advancing Capitalism.</FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""image-source"" data-e2e-name=""image-source"">

Smith maintains that the desire be perceived as benevolent has made corporations less competitive. &quot;It's going to put them out of business,&quot; he says. </P><P> Aida Greenbury of APP disagrees. &quot;We are doing this because consumers are calling for it as well,&quot; she points out. </P><P> But Smith insists most of the research on consumer preferences is flawed. &quot;Companies go out to people and say, 'How do you feel about my brand now that I'm fuzzier and wuzzier and greener?'&quot; he says. &quot;But there's very little data that that translates into sales.&quot; That's not to say CEOs shouldn't be pay lip service to environmental concerns. &quot;I mean, look, don't go around saying, 'We don't care about these things,'&quot; Smith says. &quot;Use all the nice, soft rhetoric you want. But for god's sake, don't take it seriously!&quot; </P><P> Smith attributes initiatives around corporate social responsibility, or CSR, to a crippling sense of shame that has taken hold in America's C-suites. &quot;The average approach of a businessman when attacked by an environmental group is to say, 'We're working on it. We're not as bad as you think. We've spent a fortune on environmental cleanup. In another decade we'll be down to zero,'&quot; he says. &quot;And then they step back and wait for applause and they never get it! Why? Because to most people, it's like a guy who gets up and says, 'All right, you've got me. I did beat my wife, but I have cut down dramatically on wife-beating in the past five years. I've gone from leather belts to cloth belts, and from every day to once a week.' </P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blockquote  pullquote""> Use all the nice, soft rhetoric you want. But for god's sake, don't take it seriously! </BLOCKQUOTE><P> &quot;You can try to please your customers,&quot; he adds, &quot;but don't try to please your critics. These people are utopians. You can never please them.&quot; </P><P> That may have been true in the past, but Greenpeace has gradually adopted a new policy that aims to give corporate leaders enough praise — and glowing brand publicity — to persuade others like them to hop on the bandwagon. Internally, this tactic has become known as &quot;spank and thank.&quot; When Kimberly-Clark adopted a new <mark>sustainable</mark> policy after a five-year battle, Greenpeace followed up with a thank-you campaign urging supporters to email Falk directly <A href=""http://kleercut.net/en/sendtokc"">to express their gratitude</A> (more than 15,000 emails were sent) and produced a humorous YouTube video in which a scruffy 20-something gazes into a mirror and practices <A href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a5OTPf2um8"">making up</A> with a former flame, Kimberly, after a rough patch. </P><P> &quot;It was a beautifully done parody,&quot; Apte says. &quot;Hats off to them on creativity. With a small budget, they produce more effective media than some of our brand guys did.&quot;                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> Recently, they did the same thing after several top tech companies made commitments to using renewable energy, flying the Greenpeace airship over the Bay Area praising Apple, Google, and Facebook for going green while slamming Amazon, Twitter, Netflix, and Pinterest for failing to do so. </P><P> &quot;We have a motto internally, which goes, 'We have no permanent friends and no permanent enemies,'&quot; Rolf Skar points out. &quot;The minute you want to change, great. We don't hold any hard feelings. We're focused on a cause, not a company.&quot; In other words, love the sinner, hate the sin. Fundamentally, Greenpeace remains an organization made up of dedicated, fiercely ideological true believers, but it has become disciplined enough to steer clear of distracting culture wars. Instead, like any good evangelist, the group stands ready to embrace any corporation that sees the light, welcoming them warmly into the fold. </P><P> &quot;As long a they see companies making a genuine effort, these guys will bend over backward to help you,&quot; Apte says. &quot;They want to use you as a role model to change others in the industry.&quot; </P><P><FIGURE id=""img-18188"" class=""figure image-figure-image  postload"" data-type=""img"" data-e2e-name=""image-figure-image"" data-media-container=""image"" style=""""><SPAN class=""image-source-caption""><FIGCAPTION class=""image-caption"" data-e2e-name=""image-caption"">From Greenpeece's video &quot;Making Up Is Hard to Do&quot; praising Kimberly-Clark. </FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""image-source"" data-e2e-name=""image-source""><A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckUdDEs1vro"">YouTube</A></SPAN></SPAN></FIGURE>
On both an interpersonal level and a strategic one, this approach has been vital. In previous eras, when activists of various stripes waged scorched-earth campaigns of demonization against corporate villains — think Nestlé, Nike, California grapes — and at times seemed to decry capitalism altogether, companies rarely saw an upside to playing ball. Now, they're guaranteed that a genuine turnaround will be greeted by a chorus of approval. As consumers increasingly seek out greener products, the halo effect provided by a Greenpeace thumbs-up can become a significant part of a brand's identity and ultimately drive revenue and build staff morale. </P><P> Indeed, the unlikely romance between Kimberly-Clark and Greenpeace seems to have deepened with time. &quot;The relationship blossomed to the point where we began sharing our five-year plans with them,&quot; Apte says. &quot;We want to know in advance if there are any showstoppers in there from their perspective.&quot; </P><H2> The Palm-Oil Crusade </H2><P> The palm-oil crusade made its public debut in 2007 with a report called &quot;Cooking the <mark>Climate</mark>,&quot; which compared the peat forests to &quot;ticking time bombs&quot; and labeled Indonesia the world's largest producer of greenhouse-gas emissions linked to deforestation.

As the report put it, &quot;Many in the industry are using the RSPO to cover their backs, putting off urgent action while the destruction continues.&quot;                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> The problem was that suppliers blended oil from numerous plantations, effectively laundering the bad oil with the good. </P><P> While Greenpeace's report openly acknowledged that &quot;consumer companies … have virtually no way of knowing whether or not the palm oil they are using is from rain forest destruction and conversion of peatlands,&quot; it nonetheless began to campaign against such multinationals. </P><P> First, it took aim at Unilever, chair of the RSPO. Following a script that had been perfected with the Kleercut campaign, it chose a beloved brand, Dove. The soap had recently rolled out a marketing campaign dedicated to questioning society's distorted ideas of female beauty. The promotion was wildly successful, turning Dove into a champion of female empowerment and a social-media darling. It also made the soap exceptionally vulnerable to criticism. Greenpeace simply made its own <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odI7pQFyjso"">dead-on parody</A> of <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei6JvK0W60I"">one of Dove's web spots</A> featuring a young Indonesian girl, and sat back as it became the organization's biggest viral hit. Unilever responded a few months later, declaring a total moratorium on palm oil linked to deforestation. </P><P> With Unilever on the path to reform, Greenpeace targeted Nestlé with a <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BCA8dQfGi0"">viral spot</A> linking Kit Kat bars with the destruction of orangutan habitats. In it, an office worker bites into a chocolate bar only to find a bloody primate finger. </P><P> &quot;Frankly I didn't like it,&quot; Skar says about the video. &quot;It was too crude.&quot; It did the trick, though, and Nestlé's botched response offered a <A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/90dbff8a-3aea-11e2-b3f0-00144feabdc0.html#axzz30sGRNUYx""> cautionary tale</A> for other companies who might find themselves facing a similar controversy in the social-media era. </P><P><FIGURE id=""img-904744"" class=""figure image-figure-image  postload"" data-type=""img"" data-e2e-name=""image-figure-image"" data-media-container=""image"" style=""""><SPAN class=""image-source-caption""><FIGCAPTION class=""image-caption"" data-e2e-name=""image-caption"">From the KitKat ad parody targeting Nestle, which has since gone green.</FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""image-source"" data-e2e-name=""image-source""><A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BCA8dQfGi0"">YouTube</A></SPAN></SPAN></FIGURE>
As the video, a parody of widely broadcast Kit Kat spot, began to rack up views, Nestlé pressured YouTube to remove it on copyright grounds. YouTube complied, prompting a flurry of angry posts on the candy bar's Facebook page, which were promptly deleted, leading to still more cries of censorship. </P><P> Reposted on Vimeo as &quot;the video Nestlé doesn't want you to see,&quot; the spot blew up. Given the lengthy campaign against Nestlé for its marketing of infant formula in the developing world — the boycott began in 1977 and is still underway — Greenpeace was &quot;ready for a long slog,&quot; Skar says. But two months later, following a dramatic shareholders' meeting that was interrupted by Greenpeace operatives who <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8kwVU5pujg"">rappelled from the ceiling</A> with a banner, the company announced a zero-deforestation policy not only for palm oil but also pulp and paper. &quot;They wound up overperforming,&quot; Skar says. &quot;Not that their supply chain is perfect, but it takes time to turn around a ship like this.&quot;                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> Having flipped Nestlé, Greenpeace promptly moved down the list to the next big offender, Procter &amp; Gamble. Len Sauers, P&amp;G's sustainability officer, says the company was already developing a <mark>sustainable</mark> palm-oil procurement policy when Greenpeace's activists turned up in Cincinnati with their climbing gear. &quot;We did not ignore those actions you reference,&quot; he writes in an email. &quot;But the fact is we were already addressing the issue.&quot; </P><P> In any case, the timing was auspicious, and the reaction was swift. </P><P> On April 9, Rolf Skar was with his girlfriend and some friends in a small rented bungalow in the beach town of Ceulita, on the Pacific coast of Mexico, when his phone began buzzing with news. </P><P> It had been just over a month since Greenpeace had initiated its campaign against Head &amp; Shoulders. The group had followed up the operation in Cincinnati with a coordinated action on March 26 that hit P&amp;G offices around the world. A banner was deployed on the company's corporate headquarters in Jakarta. Activists in tiger suits turned up at a facility in Manila. A red carpet walk of shame was unfurled in Delhi. And at a cleaning-products conference in Manchester, <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/slQunEP7Ips"">activists presented</A> a Golden Axe Award to the company's head of sustainability. </P><P> Now, P&amp;G appeared to be making a change. The company had issued a press release touting a <A href=""http://news.pg.com/press-release/pg-corporate-announcements/pg-sets-new-sustainability-goal-no-deforestation-its-palm-s""> new sustainability goal</A>, and Skar's colleagues had scheduled a conference call to plan their response. Skar hopped on the call. There were six people on the phone — high-level staffers from around the world. They all digested the announcement, looking for loopholes.                                               </P><P> The language was impressive. &quot;P&amp;G's commitment to no deforestation in its palm supply chain is unequivocal,&quot; Len Sauers wrote in a press release. &quot;Our aim is to develop effective long-term solutions to the complicated issue of palm-oil sustainability. We are committed to driving positive change throughout the entire supply chain, not just for us, but for the industry and for the small farmers who depend on this crop.&quot; </P><P> That sounded pretty definitive, but the fine print wasn't perfect. The 2020 timeline for total compliance seemed distant, and the definition of high-<mark>carbon</mark> forests was somewhat vague. But Skar, among others, was convinced the company meant business. </P><P> The one with the final say was Bustar Maitar, the head of the Indonesian forest campaign. &quot;If he's not happy, none of us can be,&quot; Skar says. </P><P> Ultimately, Maitar gave his assent and Greenpeace drafted a statement. P&amp;G, it said, &quot;finally took the plunge and decided to clean up its act and wash its supply chain clean of bad palm oil.&quot; </P><P> Shortly after the announcement, I asked Skar what company he thought would stumble into Greenpeace's crosshairs next. &quot;Johnson &amp; Johnson has a lot of great brands,&quot; he said.                                                                                 
                    

        

    </P><P> But just a week later, J&amp;J, too, <A href=""https://www.jnj.com/sites/default/files/pdf/cs/JnJ-Responsible-Palm-Oil-Sourcing-Criteria.pdf""> pledged</A> to stop using palm oil linked to deforestation, leaving just PepsiCo among the U.S.-based companies Greenpeace originally pressed for action. </P><P> Skar declines to discuss Greenpeace's plans, but it's not hard to picture a full-on media blitz touting &quot;Uncool Ranch Doritos&quot; or &quot;Mountain Don't&quot; coming soon to a YouTube channel near you. </P><P style=""text-align: center;""> *** </P><P> After the March operation in Cincinnati, the nine Greenpeace activists were arrested and spent the night in jail. They were charged with burglary, vandalism, trespassing, and inducing panic. If convicted, the felony charges could bring maximum sentences 9 1/2 years and $20,000 in fines, a notably harsh punishment for a kid in a tiger costume.                       </P><P> &quot;While some people may be sympathetic to their message, this is definitely a crime,&quot; Hamilton County prosecutor Joseph Deters wrote in a <A href=""http://www.hcpros.org/press-room/2014/hamilton-county-prosecutor-joseph-t-deters-announces-felony-indictment-procter-gambl""> press release</A>. &quot;This was a very sophisticated plan that put P &amp; G, fire, and police personnel at risk while causing damage to a major corporation. They had numerous other ways to get their message across without committing a crime. They should be prepared to face the consequences.&quot; </P><P> Greenpeace might well reply that <mark>climate change</mark> carries some significant consequences as well. The good news is that the business world appears increasingly to understand this reality. Asked what advice she'd give to a CEO who finds his or her company in Greenpeace's crosshairs, APP's Aida Greenbury is categorical. &quot;Embrace your harshest critics,&quot; she says. &quot;Tackle your most difficult problems head-on. It's 2014. It's not the time when companies can play greenwashing and hope that the issues will be buried. We have the internet now — full transparency. So stop dancing around with the elephant in the room. Try to find solutions and implement them.&quot; </P></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa, Mexico’s Ambassador to Germany since 2012, was on hand to speak and congratulate the winners, who would be formally honored at the UN <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference in Bonn from November 6-17, 2017. The Hertie <A href=""https://www.hertie-school.org/en/2017-10-12_momentum_for_change_lighthouse_activities/"">event</A> was co-organized by UN <mark>Climate Change</mark>, the Hertie School (represented by Dr. Christian Flachsland, Assistant Professor), and the <A href=""http://www.dgvn.de/homepage/"">United Nations Association of Germany</A> (represented by Dr. Lisa Heemann, Secretary-General).</P><P>The winning initiatives were presented by <A href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/giulia-houston-b4b874125/"">Giulia Houston of Progetto QUID</A>, an Italian non-profit that repurposes surplus fabrics into designer clothing, <A href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-jennings-a1392711/?locale=de_DE"">Lisa Jennings from the Head &amp; Shoulders brand of Proctor &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G)</A>, and Munish Datta, head of the strategy and delivery of the sustainability program of British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer (M&amp;S). I had the privilege of attending the event, and to date was able to interview two of the winners, Ms. Houston and Ms. Jennings, to follow up in more detail on the business and financial side of their remarkable achievements. I hope that these exchanges can spur the imagination of our readers who may be in a position, now or in the future, to undertake similar initiatives.</P><P><STRONG>Profetto QUID –‘From Waste to Wow’ (based on an interview with Giulia Houston, Institutional Relations)</STRONG></P><P>Based in Verona, Italy, <A href=""http://progettoquid.it/progetto/"">QUID</A> is a woman-led, eco-fashion social enterprise that addresses <mark>climate change</mark> and sustainability while responding to gender inequality by providing jobs for disadvantaged female workers (85% of employees are women, with 70% considered disadvantaged). QUID was founded in 2012 by Anna Fiscale, who holds a Master in European Affairs from Sciences Po Paris and continues to serve as the organization’s President. In 2016, over 200,000 meters of fabric were recovered by QUID, resulting in reductions in <mark>CO2</mark> emissions of approximately 18,000 tonnes. Meanwhile, 500,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of water, 650 tonnes of chemical auxiliaries and 300 tonnes of coloring products were also saved, compared to standard production methods. Per Ms. Houston, these figures were estimated based on a study by an Italian university detailing the environmental impact of clothing production. The reclaimed fabrics used by QUID come from two sources – either excess material from fashion companies, which QUID obtains without cost, or fabrics held by textile companies, for example in odd quantities. In the latter case, QUID acquires the fabrics at a nominal cost sufficient to cover shipping and handling costs.</P><P>QUID’s expansion has been rapid, with revenues (turnover) growing from just €100,000 in 2013 to over €1 million in 2016 and projected to increase further to approximately €2 million in 2017. Helping to fuel sales growth is the increasing popularity of <mark>sustainable</mark> products in Italy, and the successful designs of QUID’s professional design team. QUID’s lead fashion designer, Valeria Valbusa, has been educated at two fashion institutes in Verona and left the private sector to help QUID pursue its vision. Ms. Valbusa works with a design team of three creative partners to put out two collections per year, sold at QUID’s five retail locations, through other retailers or jointly marketed with a supplier/partner. The price point is slightly above what a consumer would expect to see in a location of the well-known Zara retail chain. QUID’s impressive growth provides inspiring evidence of the market’s receptiveness to creative products that hold sustainability as a key focus.</P><P><STRONG>Procter &amp; Gamble, TerraCycle, and SUEZ Environment – Reclaiming Global Waterways and Beaches (based on an interview with Lisa Jennings, Vice President, Global Hair &amp; Sustainability, P&amp;G)</STRONG></P><P>With the help of its partners, <A href=""https://www.pg.co.uk/"">P&amp;G</A> recently launched an exciting initiative to market the world’s first recyclable shampoo bottle made from “beach plastic” waste for its shampoo brand Head &amp; Shoulders, with170,000 bottles produced to date. The bottle contains 25% plastic recovered from beaches in the UK and France. According to a lifecycle assessment comparing the recycling model of TerraCycle versus the standard model of producing and landfilling virgin plastic, the former results in a 60% reduction in <mark>CO2</mark> emissions and a 95% reduction in released toxins such as pesticides and chemicals.</P><P>Ms. Jennings first described the biggest obstacles to reaching the current threshold of 25% recycled plastic in each bottle. She explained that the making of the Head &amp; Shoulders beach bottle faced several challenges, including brand identification. The Head &amp; Shoulders bottle has long been recognizable by its white and blue colours. Due to the recycled beach plastic, the beach bottle is grey. Ms. Jennings explained that while proceeding with a grey-coloured bottle was not an easy decision, P&amp;G felt it was the right thing to do.</P><P>While the initial launch of the project has relied on plastic reclaimed from the beaches of the UK and France, P&amp;G’s efforts are not limited to this geography, and there are plans and activities already reaching areas more severely affected by beach plastic <mark>pollution</mark>. P&amp;G’s aim is to expand the current project to other countries around the world, including developing nations. Ms. Jennings explained that a lack of waste management infrastructure can be an important limitation in such locales, and often requires waste to be shipped to cities, where better infrastructure exists. Through the company’s Waste2Worth project, in partnership with the Asia Development Bank, in the Philippines today there are agreements with three cities to advance new <mark>sustainable</mark> waste management models. P&amp;G has also partnered with Ocean Conservancy and the Trash Free Seas Alliance to support their goal of reducing plastic leakage to the ocean by 50% by 2030. Finally, P&amp;G’s 2020 goal is to double their use of recycled resin in plastic packaging. By the end of 2018, Hair Care will add half a billion bottles annually containing 25% post-consumer recycled content (PCR) in Europe.</P><P>The partnership to make the Head &amp; Shoulders beach plastic bottle brings together TerraCycle’s collection programs, which focus on community and volunteer engagement, and SUEZ’s expertise in waste recycling and recovery. In this case, P&amp;G funds <A href=""https://www.terracycle.co.uk/en-UK/"">TerraCycle</A> collection programs to reclaim plastic from beaches and waterways. The collected plastic is sent to a TerraCycle warehouse and sorted, separating out things like seaweed. The sorted waste is sent to a <A href=""https://www.suez.com/en"">SUEZ</A> processing facility where it is shredded, cleaned, and processed into the pure high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic used in production of the finished bottle.</P><P>So, what are the limits to expanding this project? Beach plastic is far more expensive than virgin plastic due to the manual sorting and cleaning needed and therefore, for the beach plastic bottle to be economically feasible to a manufacturer like P&amp;G, partnerships like the one with TerraCycle are needed. According to Ms. Jennings, the Head &amp; Shoulders beach plastic bottle has received unwavering positive acceptance by retailers and media, which gives the company confidence of the scale and commercial viability of the project. Since its announcement at Davos, the project has generated more than three billion media impressions worldwide, helping drive awareness about the issue of plastic <mark>pollution</mark> and encouraging consumers to recycle. P&amp;G is confident that initiatives like theirs will inspire other brands and industries to follow, creating demand and value for recycled plastic, and further moving the drive toward sustainability forward.</P><P><A href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-parisi-3095b72a/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Jonathan Parisi</A> is a class of 2019 Master of International Affairs candidate at the Hertie School.

      report</A> today, detailing the progress it is making to reduce its 
      environmental footprint and improve social conditions for those in need.
    </P><P>
      The report reinforces the Company’s commitment to operating sustainably 
      and details the progress against the Company’s long-term vision of 
      producing products that consumers love while maximizing the conservation 
      of resources, powering all its plants with 100% renewable energy, using 
      100% renewable or recycled materials for all products and packaging and 
      having zero consumer and manufacturing waste go to landfill.
    </P><P>
      The report highlights P&amp;G’s recent efforts to address <mark>climate change</mark>, 
      including a new goal to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 30% 
      by 2020 and two new partnerships with Constellation Energy and EDF RE 
      which will increase the Company’s use of renewable energy. The report 
      also details the Company’s commitment to responsible sourcing of wood 
      fiber and palm oil and the progress being made in this area.
    </P><P>
      In addition, P&amp;G continues to invest in the community and those in need 
      through its Children’s Safe Drinking Water (CSDW) Program by delivering 
      more than 8 billion liters of clean water to children and families who 
      do not have to clean water (<A target=""_blank"" href=""http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Df6cNvjSWZyM&amp;esheet=51243769&amp;newsitemid=20151215006021&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=video&amp;index=2&amp;md5=edee64638d94acbfed98a15e6b48ccd5"" rel=""nofollow"">video</A>). 
      P&amp;G announced it will deliver 15 billion liters by 2020 working in 
      partnership with humanitarian and emergency partners around the world. 
      P&amp;G has also been actively helping those impacted by natural disasters, 
      and this year responded with provision of in kind product and monetary 
      donations to more than 25 disasters globally.

      “At P&amp;G, we have a long history of introducing <mark>innovation</mark>s that improve 
      our environmental footprint and the communities where we live and work. 
      Sustainability is integrated into the way we do business, and this 
      report details the progress we have made in conserving resources, 
      protecting the environment and improving social conditions for those who 
      need it most,” said Martin Riant, Group President and P&amp;G Executive 
      Sponsor of Sustainability. “We are making great progress in increasing

            gas emissions by 30% by 2020. Since 2010, P&amp;G has reduced 
            greenhouse gas emissions by 4%.

            Company has met our commitment to convert more than 20% of our 
            truckloads to natural gas vehicles by 2016. This represents more 
            than 14 million truck miles using cleaner burning natural gas 
            while at the same time delivering several millions in cost savings.

            globally.

            such as moving Pampers from boxes to bags in most parts of Western 
            Europe. This initiative resulted in more than an 80% reduction in 
            packaging material weight per diaper saving more than 6000 tones 
            of packaging material or the weight of approximately 4000 mid-size 
            cars.

        our brands.

      “Sustainability is a responsibility and a business opportunity. Since 
      2007, we have realized a cost savings of nearly $2 billion through waste 
      and energy savings and have reduced our environmental impact. It is 
      exciting to see the changes we are making in our operations, the 
      benefits created for the business and the progress we are making against 
      our sustainability goals,” said P&amp;G Vice President of Sustainability Len 
      Sauers.

Most companies don’t agree with his notion that <mark>climate</mark> action is bad for the economy, as evidenced in part by a recent full-page <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM> ad signed by the CEOs of companies across sectors. Trump, in other words, may be ignoring a clear message coming from our titans of industry. He has claimed for a long time to want to put America first, but by abdicating his responsibility and leadership for the greatest challenge facing humanity, the country may lag. He may, in fact, be putting America last.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article article-first-row""><P>According to reports, <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/<mark>climate</mark>/trump-quits-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-accord.html"" target=""_blank"">President Trump is expected to pull the U.S. out of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement</A>. This is a horrible decision for business, the United States, and humanity.</P><P>In this moment, running through the details of the agreement itself, which commits <A href=""http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php"" target=""_blank"">nearly every country in the world to significant energy and <mark>carbon</mark> reductions</A>, is not vital. Nor is what we could analyze — from what will actually change in how the U.S. uses energy or emits <mark>carbon</mark> if the agreement is abandoned (it’s not a straightforward discussion by any means) to what states, cities, and citizens can do as a result.</P><P>But the key point I want to make here is that <EM>the business community does not want to leave the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement</EM>. Let me repeat: Even though Trump and his team keep telling everyone that <mark>climate</mark> action is somehow bad for the economy, most companies don’t agree with that assessment.</P><P>On May 10, in an attempt to influence the president’s thinking, 30 CEOs wrote an open letter to Trump, taking out a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal. The opening reads, “We are writing to express our strong support for the U.S. remaining in the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement.” I won’t reprint the whole letter here, but <A href=""http://bteam.org/announcements/30-major-ceos-call-on-trump-stay-in-paris/"" target=""_blank"">please read it</A>.</P><P>It is, however, worth taking a moment to look at the companies whose CEOs made their views known:</P><P>3M Company</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE-CONTENT></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Science-based targets are like crystal balls — you can use them to see into the future.</P><P>More precisely, they’re a window into a <A href=""https://www.bsr.org/en/our-insights/report-view/creating-an-action-agenda-for-private-sector-leadership-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">more <mark>climate</mark>-compatible world</A>.</P><P>On Dec. 15, 2015, world leaders — alongside businesses, non-governmental organizations and other non-state actors — <A href=""https://www.bsr.org/our-insights/blog-view/the-paris-agreement-on-<mark>climate</mark>-is-adopted"">gathered in Paris</A> to agree to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (with a stretch goal of 1.5 degrees). The resulting Paris Agreement established an important threshold, set by science, to help society avoid dangerous and costly <mark>climate change</mark> impacts, such as extreme weather and sea level rise. This means putting less greenhouse gases — the principal heat-trapping agents that cause global warming, such as <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide — into the atmosphere.</P><P>Today, the world emits <A href=""https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/<mark>CO2</mark>EmissionsTrends.pdf"">more than 30 billion metric tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide equivalent (<mark>CO2</mark>e) per year (PDF)</A> into the atmosphere. Tomorrow, this figure will change. Some argue it will rise, given business-as-usual practices. Others argue it will decrease, as <A href=""https://www.bsr.org/en/our-insights/blog-view/why-we-need-to-review-<mark>climate</mark>-commitments-every-five-years"">policy action ratchets up de<mark>carbon</mark>ization</A> to adhere to the Paris Agreement.</P><P>No one can predict the future perfectly, but the International Energy Agency (IEA) has developed some of the best thinking on what a de<mark>carbon</mark>izing world could look like. <A href=""https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/EnergyTechnologyPerspectives2016_ExecutiveSummary_EnglishVersion.pdf"">IEA’s &quot;2 Degrees Scenario&quot; (PDF)</A> paints a technological pathway through 2050 and beyond of a world avoiding a breach of the 2 degree Celsius limit. In 2050, according to the IEA, a 2-degree world would emit less than half the <mark>carbon</mark> emissions it emits today. </P><P>Put simply, science-based targets are meant to <A href=""https://www.greenbiz.com/node/106311"">align companies with the vision of a <mark>climate</mark>-compatible future</A>. Specific targets that companies set will depend heavily on the sector.</P><P>For example, the <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive power generation sector will have to divorce itself from its greenhouse gas footprint more forcefully than, say, the industrial sector. Even within sectors, targets will vary greatly by industry, whether we look to cement, shipping, apparel, food, home appliances or something else.</P><P>The IEA presents one possible scenario of a <mark>climate</mark>-compatible tomorrow, but <A href=""http://sciencebasedtargets.org/methods/"">other legitimate scenarios exist</A> as well. Moreover, these scenarios likely will change over time. Science-based targets invariably will depend upon the scenario that’s chosen.</P><P>Despite these complexities, science-based targets all do the same thing: They align company ambition with a <mark>climate</mark>-compatible world, which brings us back to the original thesis. Science-based targets simply can be thought of as a window into the future. This future is fundamentally bright because it reflects a development pathway consistent with <mark>climate</mark> science and the broader sustainability agenda. In short, it’s a future worth fighting for.</P><P>Business is accelerating its uptake of aggressive targets that concur with <mark>climate</mark> science. As of this blog’s publication date, more than <A href=""http://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action/"">170 companies have signed up with the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi)</A> — a joint venture of heavyweight civil society players championing the movement — to set and implement science-based targets.</P><P>Of those signatories, 20 already have verified with the SBTi that their targets are indeed science-aligned, including Dell Inc., General Mills, NRG Energy and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Late last summer, <A href=""http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/38222-General-Mills-Announces-New-Commitment-on-<mark>Climate</mark>-Change"">General Mills announced ambitious science-based targets</A>, which cover its massive upstream agriculture footprint. The company vowed to cut absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 28 percent across its entire value chain — from farm to fork to landfill. <A href=""https://www.bsr.org/our-insights/blog-view/how-general-mills-worked-with-bsr-to-set-<mark>climate</mark>-targets"">BSR helped General Mills develop the strategy</A> for setting this watershed target.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""field field-name-field-gbz-article-source field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix""><DIV class=""field-label"">This story first appeared on: </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

	Will Allen is an urban farmer who is transforming the cultivation, production, and delivery of healthy foods to underserved, urban populations. In 1995, while assisting neighborhood children with a gardening project, Allen began developing the farming methods and educational programs that are now the hallmark of the non-profit organization Growing Power, which he directs and co-founded. Guiding all is his efforts is the recognition that the unhealthy diets of low-income, urban populations, and such related health problems as obesity and diabetes, largely are attributable to limited access to safe and affordable fresh fruits and vegetables. Rather than embracing the “back to the land” approach promoted by many within the <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture movement, Allen’s holistic farming model incorporates both cultivating foodstuffs and designing food distribution networks in an urban setting. Through a novel synthesis of a variety of low-cost farming technologies – including use of raised beds, aquaculture, vermiculture, and heating greenhouses through composting – Growing Power produces vast amounts of food year-round at its main farming site, two acres of land located within Milwaukee’s city limits. Recently, cultivation of produce and livestock has begun at other urban and rural sites in and around Milwaukee and Chicago. Over the last decade, Allen has expanded Growing Power’s initiatives through partnerships with local organizations and activities such as the Farm-City Market Basket Program, which provides a weekly basket of fresh produce grown by members of the Rainbow Farmer’s Cooperative to low-income urban residents at a reduced cost. The internships and workshops hosted by Growing Power engage teenagers and young adults, often minorities and immigrants, in producing healthy foods for their communities and provide intensive, hands-on training to those interested in establishing similar farming initiatives in other urban settings. Through these and other programs still in development, Allen is experimenting with new and creative ways to improve the diet and health of the urban poor.</P><P>
	Will Allen received a B.A. (1971) from the University of Miami. After a brief career in professional basketball and a number of years in corporate marketing at Procter and Gamble, he returned to his roots as a farmer. He has served as the founder and CEO of Growing Power, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, since 1995 and has taught workshops to aspiring urban farmers across the United States and abroad.</P><H3>

	Will Allen continues to serve as CEO of Growing Power, Inc., which has expanded its programs throughout the Milwaukee and Chicago areas, and he is involved in community food projects across the country. In 2010, he was invited to participate in First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! campaign, and in 2011, he received a James Beard Award and was named one of the “World’s Most Influential Foodies” by Michael Pollan and <I>Forbes</I> magazine.

Investors continue to look to boards of directors to oversee companies’ navigation through these challenges while at the same time producing superior operating results, financial returns and stock price appreciation.</P><P>Activist investors remain active, quick to challenge a company’s business strategy, management’s ability to execute and the board’s capabilities. In addition, many long-term institutional investors and large asset managers have become more likely to question whether board members possess the appropriate skills, knowledge and characteristics to oversee the company’s business and management to avoid or mitigate risks and ensure long-term value creation.</P><P>In light of these dynamics, boards of directors must focus on the three “C’s”: composition of the board; communication, both regarding items of importance to investors and to convey the board’s competence with and command of issues that pose threats to long-term performance; and connection, or building relationships, with investors to establish credibility and confidence, which become essential when a company hits a rough patch.</P><P><STRONG>Board Composition</STRONG></P><P>Recent proxy fights at Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) by Trian Partners and at Automatic Data Processing by Pershing Square stand as stark reminders that shareholder activism remains a permanent part of the corporate landscape and that mega-cap companies are not immune to activist attack. The Trian campaign at P&amp;G was unique in that the only Trian nominee was Nelson Peltz, and Trian indicated that it would be willing to add back to the P&amp;G board the unseated incumbent director if Trian prevailed. Nevertheless, over the past few years, activist investors have become more sophisticated in forming slates of nominees in proxy contests, typically nominating candidates with relevant industry and other operational experience consistent with the activist’s case for a board’s shortcomings.</P><P>Citing evidence supporting the view that more diverse boards outperform boards lacking diversity, large asset managers such as BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard have been unambiguous in expressing their desire to see greater boardroom diversity — with an emphasis on gender diversity. In addition, in September 2017, the New York City comptroller and New York City pension funds followed up their successful campaign to increase the number of companies with proxy access bylaws with a new campaign dubbed “Boardroom Accountability Project 2.0” to “ratchet up the pressure on some of the biggest companies in the world to make their boards more diverse, independent, and <mark>climate</mark>-competent, so that they are in a position to deliver better long-term returns for investors.”</P><P>Recent data on boards of directors of Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index companies indicates that boards are, in fact, becoming more diverse — with Spencer Stuart reporting in its 2017 U.S. Board Index that more than half of incoming directors were women or minorities — although the pace of change may not be as swift as some would prefer. As described in Vanguard’s August 31, 2017, open letter to public company directors, Vanguard “view[s] the board as one of a company’s most critical strategic assets” and believes that “when a company has a great board of directors, good results are more likely to follow.” It will remain incumbent on boards and board-nominating committees to be vigilant in analyzing and assessing the composition of the board and its members’ skill sets in light of the company’s business, strategy and challenges to ensure that investors continue to perceive the board as an important strategic asset.</P><P><STRONG>Communication</STRONG></P><P>One outcome of the adoption of mandatory say-on-pay votes has been the transformation of proxy statements, at least at many large-cap companies. Proxy statements have evolved from “compliance documents” that hew closely to required disclosures to “communications documents” that strive to convey a coherent and continuing story regarding company strategy and performance. In addition, proxy statements go to lengths to explain how the directors standing for election, as well as the executive compensation structure subject to the say-on-pay vote, support that strategy and incentivize that performance. Consistent with this transformation, BlackRock’s 2016 annual letter to CEOs requested that they “lay out for shareholders each year a strategic framework for long-term value creation [and] explicitly affirm that their boards have reviewed those plans.” BlackRock’s 2017 annual letter commended companies for heeding this call, stating that these disclosures “provided shareholders with an opportunity to evaluate a company’s long-term strategy and the progress made in executing on it.” BlackRock’s recently released 2018 annual letter reiterated this call for companies to publicly articulate their strategic framework for long-term value creation and to “demonstrate[] to investors that your board is engaged with the strategic direction of the company.”</P><P>As companies have expanded and improved their communications regarding strategy, performance and executive compensation, shareholders have called for expanded and improved disclosure on other topics of concern. For example, the New York City comptroller’s Boardroom Accountability Project 2.0 goes beyond calling for more diverse boards by seeking better disclosure — in particular a board skills matrix so that investors can more easily assess the skills and diversity represented in the boardroom. Although some companies in recent years have been including a directors skills matrix in their proxy statements, others view matrices as an oversimplification or crude device to convey the complexities of boardroom composition. In any event, the campaign makes it clear that some investors believe there is a lack of communication or transparency regarding board skills and composition. As a result, companies should consider, whether by using a matrix or other forms of disclosure, how to best convey the thought and care that goes into determining the needs of the board in terms of skill sets, and how those determinations are addressed in the board refreshment process.</P><P>Another topic on which investors seek greater information is sustainability. Sustainability encompasses a broad range of issues and is not limited to <mark>climate change</mark> and related environmental topics, although that remains an essential area where investors seek more transparency in how a company is addressing the risks presented and seek better ways to compare the financial impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> from one company to the next. Sustainability also may include items such as human capital management as well as business practices and corporate culture matters that have the potential to either foster or derail long-term value creation. As stated in BlackRock’s 2017 letter to CEOs, “[e]nvironmental, social and governance (ESG) factors relevant to a company’s business can provide essential insights into management effectiveness and thus a company’s long-term prospects.” As companies continue to consider how they communicate business strategy to investors, they also will need to determine how to convey the ways in which relevant sustainability matters are factored into their business strategy and how the boards oversee the associated risks as part of their oversight responsibilities.</P><P>Beyond sustainability, BlackRock’s 2018 annual letter to CEOs calls on companies to “not only deliver financial performance, but also show how [the company] makes a positive contribution to society.” While this call is best understood in light of BlackRock’s focus on long-term financial performance, it nevertheless will require additional efforts by companies and boards of directors to consider what and how they communicate with stakeholders and the public regarding a host of issues beyond financial performance.</P><P><STRONG>Connection</STRONG></P><P>For a number of years, the message for boards of directors has been to enhance engagement with shareholders. As a result, companies and directors have expanded their shareholder engagement efforts, often meeting with investor governance teams and increasingly including director involvement in engagement efforts regarding topics such as executive compensation, board leadership and board refreshment practices. Investors may not always feel a need to engage with a particular company or its directors, but periodic check-ins and reminders that directors are available can garner the credibility and goodwill that may be critical when the board is facing an activist challenge or other crisis.</P><P>BlackRock made it a point following the 2017 annual meeting at ExxonMobil to explain that it had repeatedly requested meetings with the company’s independent directors to better understand the board’s oversight of long-term strategy amid major strategic challenges (including but not limited to <mark>climate change</mark>), and that those requests were denied pursuant to the company’s policy of not permitting engagement between independent directors and shareholders. As a result, BlackRock voted against the company’s lead independent director and the chair of the committee responsible for this policy. According to press reports, in December 2017, ExxonMobil announced that the board had changed the policy and would allow directors to engage directly with key shareholders to address areas of interest.</P><P>It also is important to remember that communication is a two-way process and that director engagement with shareholders can provide directors with valuable insights into investor perceptions. In some instances, directors may learn that they are already addressing issues of importance to investors, but company disclosures fail to effectively communicate that fact, creating a gap between investor perception and reality. In any event, listening to investor views with an open mind is an important element of director-shareholder engagement.</P><P>As boards of directors head into 2018, some of the challenges they face will be familiar and some not yet known. The recent sexual harassment scandals present issues that boards were not contemplating a year ago but are now playing a role in board CEO searches and succession planning. Directors will be better positioned to address these challenges if they pay attention to the three “C’s”— they have focused on board composition so that the board has the diverse skills and perspectives to address the challenges that inevitably arise; they have communicated with investors to convey the board’s diligent oversight of business strategy and risks, and how the board is a strategic asset for the company; and they have connected and built relationships with investors so that they have the credibility and goodwill with investors that provide the board time to manage through the challenges.</P></DIV><P align=""left""><SPAN lang=""EN"" style=""color: #000000; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 8pt; font-style: italic; mso-fareast-font-family: calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: en; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"">This memorandum is provided by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP and its affiliates for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended and should not be construed as legal advice.

Reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions would require devastating economic losses, their argument goes.</P><P>But in recent years large corporations have changed their tune, slowly eroding the economic argument for inaction. On Wednesday, nine Fortune 500 companies announced plans to switch to sourcing 100% renewable energy, joining a growing group of corporations recognizing the risks of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“In the early 90s there was a sense that business was holding us back and governments were trying to push forward,” says David Levy, a professor at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. “Now, companies are coming forward to say, ‘This is important.'”</P><P>Companies have been aware of the risks <mark>climate change</mark> poses to their businesses for years—even decades—but developments this year may leading to a tipping point, experts say. Last month, the White House announced a series of landmark regulations to address global warming, and negotiators from around the world are expected to reach a historic agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions in United Nations negotiations in Paris later this year.</P><P>Companies taking part in Wednesday’s announcement, a list that includes household names like Walmart, Goldman Sachs and Starbucks, have set individual time frames to go 100% renewable, from a 2015 deadline set by Voya Financial to a 2050 deadline set by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</P><P>“Companies have looked at <mark>climate change</mark> and said, ’It’s not if we have to address it, but when,'” says University of Michigan School of Business Professor Andy Hoffman. “A lot of them are looking at the shift in the conversation and thinking now is the time to start.”</P><P>Businesses have a number of reasons to act on <mark>climate change</mark>. In addition to gaining positive publicity, companies hope to mitigate some of the financial risks <mark>climate change</mark> poses to their businesses. A Citigroup <A href=""https://ir.citi.com/hsq32Jl1m4aIzicMqH8sBkPnbsqfnwy4Jgb1J2kIPYWIw5eM8yD3FY9VbGpK%2Baax"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">report</A> released last month found that minimizing temperature rises could minimize global GDP loss to the tune of $50 trillion in the coming decades.</P><P>“Lowering risk, protecting against price rises, saving millions and boosting brand is what shaping a low <mark>carbon</mark> economy is all about,” says Mark Kenber, CEO of the <mark>Climate</mark> Group, which organized Wednesday’s announcement.</P><P>The full list of companies that committed to go renewable Wednesday includes NIKE Inc., Procter &amp; Gamble, Salesforce and Steelcase.</P><P>The threat <mark>climate change</mark> poses to the world economy may be why some companies have committed to steps beyond just sourcing renewable energy. Microsoft, for instance, sources entirely renewable energy and buys <mark>carbon</mark> credits to make up for it <mark>carbon</mark> emissions in other areas like travel. Marks &amp; Spencer, one of the United Kingdom’s largest retailers, went entirely <mark>carbon</mark> neutral in 2012, reducing its energy usage and offsetting what it did use by funding projects that reduce <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels in the atmosphere, said Mike Barry, the company’s director of <mark>sustainable</mark> business, at a press conference on Tuesday.</P><P>“If we’re going to get tens of thousands of companies to do it, they have to see the business case,” he said. “We can’t just ask them to do it.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""bottom-recirc padded-mobile "" data-tracking-zone=""bottom-recirc""><DIV class=""component lead-gen clearfix bottom-recirc"" data-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3365&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABPFT&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-mobile-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3365&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABPFT&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-partial=""sponsored-tile"" data-variation=""bottom-recirc"" data-title=""SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT"" data-provider=""dianomi"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-bottom-recirc"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-right-rail"" data-logo=""http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png"" data-logo_url=""https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&amp;utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank"" data-native_ad=""%7B%22dimensions%22%3A%22482x100%22%2C%22placement%22%3A%22footer%22%2C%22priority%22%3A6%7D"" data-nativekey=""KRVQvVbckcRMP4FTYBYnvWqY""><DIV class=""title-wrapper""><H3 class=""subtitle"">SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

        And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Source: DPA/Mike Nelson.
      </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>David Katz has the air of a televangelist. But his sermons have more to do with fighting <mark>pollution</mark> than saving his listeners’ souls. “Together we can put an end to ocean plastic!” he told a recent public meeting in Germany. “We can turn rubbish into a currency, and so create opportunities for people living in poverty.”</P><P>Mr. Katz is the founder and CEO of Plastic Bank, a social enterprise that helps people in developing countries collect <A href=""https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/clearing-europes-beaches-of-plastic-trash-875868"">plastic trash</A> on polluted beaches. In return, they receive cash, donations-in-kind and social services. The plastic they collect is recycled by consumer-goods companies and re-used to produce plastic bottles.</P><P><A href=""https://global.handelsblatt.com/companies/a-fly-in-the-ointment-742478"">Henkel</A> is the first major consumer-goods firm to work with Plastic Bank. “In the second half of this year, we will work with Plastic Bank to make recycled plastic for new packaging,” says Thomas Müller-Kirschbaum, head of global research and development with Henkel’s laundry detergent division.</P><P>The Düsseldorf-based firm sees itself as raising consumers’ awareness of <mark>pollution</mark> caused by plastic packaging. But the company, along with its competitors Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever, is under pressure to do more to address the problem, too. Images of floating islands of plastic garbage have focused global attention on the consequences of a rapid increase in plastic packaging for consumer goods. And if the present looks bad, a recent wave of reports have painted a bleak picture of the future indeed. It is estimated that by 2050, there will be more plastic than fish in the world’s oceans.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
            Eight million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year, the equivalent of one truckload per hour.
        </P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The issue seems to be striking a chord with consumers across the globe: A study published on Sunday by consulting firm PwC suggests one-third would be prepared to reject a product because of un<mark>sustainable</mark> and excessive packaging. And long-established garbage routes are closing. This year China, long a recipient of exported trash, has announced an import ban on 24 different recycling materials.</P><P>The European Commission has plans to force companies to radically cut down on waste. “We must prevent plastic getting into our water, our food and even our bodies,” Frans Timmermans, the Commission vice-president, recently demanded. He is planning a new EU initiative which will make it mandatory for all plastics to be recyclable by 2030.</P><P>The task is herculean. French NGO Vacances Propres, which campaigns for clean beaches, estimates that around 20 million tons of garbage are dumped into the environment every year. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a British charity, says 8 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year. That’s the equivalent of a truckload every hour. And each single plastic bottle has a lifespan of around 1,000 years in the environment.</P><P>Henkel sold around 280,000 tonnes of plastic packaging in 2016. But it is far from the only company with a problem. “We will make 100 percent of our packaging recyclable by 2020,” Virginie Hélias, vice president of Global Sustainability at Procter &amp; Gamble, says. “Today, that level is 86 percent.”</P><P>P&amp;G has just launched a Head and Shoulders shampoo in Germany which uses a new kind of recycled bottle, partly made with plastic found on the world’s beaches, collected and sorted by the US company Terracycle. Ms. Hélias hailed the new product as “an important pilot project.”</P><P>The American firm says it wants to sell 500 million of the new bottles by the end of the year. The new plastic production method is more expensive, it acknowledges. “We see it as an investment to convince more people about the value of recycling,” says Ms. Hélias.</P><P>Unilever boss Paul Polman recently appealed to the consumer goods industry to intensify its efforts to get away from what he called the “Take-Make-Dispose Model.” Last month, the massive Anglo-Dutch consumer-goods firm pledged to make 100 percent of its plastic packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.</P><FIGURE class=""article-image rs_skip""><FIGCAPTION>
        There’s no carpet big enough to brush it under. Source: DPA.
      </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Green groups say voluntary obligations like these are a step in the right direction. “The consumer-goods industry needs a fundamental rethink,” says Michael Meyer-Krotz, a veteran campaigner with Greenpeace. “It’s a question of avoiding as much trash as possible and introducing refill systems for consumer goods packaging.”</P><P>Mr. Meyer-Krotz knows what he is talking about: He has helped clean up the beaches around Manila in the Philippines. There, he witnessed freshly-cleaned sand completely covered in plastic trash the following day. Most of the plastics, he says, came from Nestlé and Unilever products.</P><P>Recycling is only part of the solution, he says. Industry must cut back its use of packaging. But there has been some progress: Mr. Müller-Kirschbaum of Henkel says their plastic bottles use 10 to 20 percent less plastic than a decade ago.</P><P>The best solution would be a re-use policy, as in drinks packaging. But even that solution is not as environmentally-friendly as it seems. To be re-used, each bottle would have to be thoroughly washed, which itself consumes considerable amounts of energy, says P&amp;G’s Ms. Hélias. “These kind of systems are only worth considering if they genuinely improve our <mark>CO2</mark> footprint,” she added, calling for a holistic view to be taken.</P><P><EM>Georg Weishaupt covers the luxury and fashion industry for Handelsblatt.

And it’s not hard to see why: In 2015, the world’s 500 biggest companies brought in revenues totaling just under 30 trillion USD, or 38% of global gross domestic product (GDP), according to <EM><A href=""http://fortune.com/2016/07/22/global-500-in-6-charts/"" target=""_blank"">Fortune</A></EM>. Such wealth could be a powerful lever for curbing <mark>climate change</mark> or combatting hunger – with the right guidance from the scientific community.</P><P>But getting scientists and business leaders to collaborate, when they speak different languages and have different goals, hasn’t always been easy.</P><P><A href=""/Overview/About-us/Our-team/SMT/Peter-White"">Peter White</A> is Chief Operating Officer for the World Business Council for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development (WBCSD), which was founded in 1995. This organisation brings together 200 member companies, including heavy-hitters like Unilever, Solvay, BT, IKEA and Toyota, to “make more <mark>sustainable</mark> companies more successful – and get recognised and rewarded for it,” White says. White came to WBCSD in 2013 after serving for 22 years developing and leading Global Sustainability at the consumer goods company Procter &amp; Gamble.</P><P>In a recent interview, he talked with Future Earth’s Rebecca Oliver about why the scientific and business communities need to come together in what he calls the “turbulent teens.” It’s especially important, he says, for making good on global initiatives like the United Nations’ <A href=""http://www.un.org/<mark>sustainable</mark>development/<mark>sustainable</mark>-development-goals/"" target=""_blank""><mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals</A> (SDGs).</P><P><STRONG>Rebecca Oliver: There have been a lot of milestones, both good and bad, for <mark>sustainable</mark> development in recent years. Where do you think we’re at in this pursuit of a more <mark>sustainable</mark> world?</STRONG></P><P>Peter White: Back in 2010, when I was with P&amp;G, we were one of 29 companies behind the work for <A href=""/Overview/About-us/Vision2050"">Vision 2050</A> at WBCSD, which developed the vision of 9 billion people by 2050, all living well, within the boundaries of the planet. We asked, “what will the world look like in 2050? What would we like it to look like, and how do we get from here to there?&quot; At that time, we called the period we are currently living in – from 2010 to 2020 – the “turbulent teens,” which was prescient. I think they are much more turbulent that any of us thought they would be.</P><P>The aim was to move from the “turbulent teens” to the “transformation times” from 2020 onwards. In fact, the year 2015 was extremely eventful in a positive sense, with the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. We now have, with the SDGs, a development programme for the planet. That is a great gift to business and to everyone else. But business is not going to pick off the goals one by one. There are 17 goals and 169 targets. That is too much and too complicated for business. The way business will address the SDGs is by addressing the big systems that need to be changed. And if you transform the energy system, food and land, cities, mobility and materials, you are actually going to deliver most if not all of the SDGs.</P><P><STRONG>RO: How can science and business work together to make these transformations happen?</STRONG></P><P>PW: In terms of structure and narrative, business is getting behind the sustainability agenda and is crying out for science-based targets to actually deliver. In many areas, if you don’t have consensus between the scientists, it’s hard to know what the action should be. So science-based targets are absolutely key, and consensus from scientists on what those targets should be is essential.</P><P>One of the big system transformations we are looking at today is the food and land-use system. In comparison with <mark>climate</mark>, there is no 2 degrees-type of target for healthy <mark>sustainable</mark> food from healthy <mark>sustainable</mark> ecosystems. We don’t have a COP [Conference of the Parties] for food, as we do for <mark>climate change</mark>. We don’t have the science-based targets for food, so if we want to make progress on transforming the food system, we need clear targets.</P><P>WBCSD has a partnership with the <A href=""http://eatforum.org/"" target=""_blank"">EAT Foundation</A> in this area. EAT have established the <A href=""http://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2016-06-14-new-solutions-for-our-global-food-system.html"" target=""_blank"">EAT - Lancet Commission</A> to help establish the basics of a healthy diet and how this can be delivered from a <mark>sustainable</mark> planet. There are strong hopes that EAT Lancet will come up with some simple targets that business can aim for.</P><P><STRONG>RO: Do policies need to change first so that business can innovate? Or can business work ahead of policy?</STRONG></P><P>PW: Business needs policy to set the minimum bar – to outlaw what is unsafe and unacceptable and level the playing field. But then business can go further. The opportunity is to promote <mark>innovation</mark>. What we delivered for Paris [Paris <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference, or COP21] was the <A href=""http://lctpi.wbcsd.org/"" target=""_blank"">Low <mark>Carbon</mark> Technology Partnership Initiative</A> (LCTPi), which was a joint initiative between the WBCSD, the SDSN [<mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Solutions Network] and the IEA [International Energy Agency] with help from the French Government.</P><P>Our efforts resulted in sectoral initiatives that brought together over 160 companies and 70 partner organisations around nine different areas. In each area, we got companies to say what progress towards a 2 degrees world is possible under current conditions. We did this in cement, chemicals, renewables, <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage, forests as <mark>carbon</mark> sinks, <mark>climate</mark>-smart agriculture and low <mark>carbon</mark> transport fuels, now called <A href=""http://below50.org/"" target=""_blank"">below50</A>, energy efficiency in buildings and low <mark>carbon</mark> freight.</P><P>PricewaterhouseCoopers did an impact assessment of where these nine commitments would get us, which showed that if everybody delivered on the programme, it could get us to 65% of what is needed for a 2 degree world, which is pretty amazing considering that is just nine areas.</P><P><STRONG>RO: How is WBCSD helping the business world to move in a more <mark>sustainable</mark> direction?</STRONG></P><P>PW: We don’t need to raise awareness any more. Everyone knows about sustainability. What we need is action, to bring companies together and work on this agenda. Our role is to help make more <mark>sustainable</mark> companies more successful – and get recognised and rewarded for it – on the premise that this is good for the company long-term. This is not CSR [Corporate Social Responsibility]. This is not philanthropy. This is in a company’s own best interests in the long-term.</P><P>We have a ground-breaking programme around redefining value. If you look at Vision 2050, one of the key things that had to happen to reach the vision of 9 billion people, all living well, within the boundaries of the planet was that companies needed to look at true value, true profits and true cost. That includes natural and social capital so that you are not looking at a company only from its financial value. We have seen significant movement down that road already, with the release of the Natural Capital Protocol, which we helped develop with the Natural Capital Coalition. We’ve also just released the <A href=""/Clusters/Social-Impact/Social-and-Human-Capital-Protocol"">Social Capital Protocol</A>.</P><P>More importantly, we’re working with investors and standard setters, the accountants of this world, to figure out how to get this actually noticed and used. There is a tonne of information being released in sustainability reports, which often is not particularly material to the value or the running of the company. Investors are saying they want information, but they don’t know what information is important. So finding a way to link the non-financial reporting system to the financial reporting system is a key piece going forward.</P><P><STRONG>RO: From a business perspective, what are the challenges in working with academia?</STRONG></P><P>PW: There is problem with transparency and trust. There is a lot of science undertaken in companies, and that can often be discounted by academia as “company science.” Similarly, academics can have a very strong view of what needs to be done but don’t necessarily understand the drivers that can get it done. What’s key is bringing together the scientists from companies and academic scientists to understand what needs to be done and what can be done. WBCSD takes knowledge from research and looks at the business context to help companies understand what the scientists are saying and what could be done.</P><P>Future Earth could be almost a mirror image of WBCSD on the academic side, explaining to academics what is useful to the business world. Disparate, disjointed and uncoordinated views from scientists can make businesses sit on their hands and wait for something more actionable.</P><P><STRONG>RO: Future Earth places a big emphasis on “co-designing” research with societal partners like businesses. Do you think this is an effective way to approach sustainability challenges?</STRONG></P><P>PW: I would not say co-designing science. I would promote co-designing solutions. Business will have some input on the fundamental questions that need answering, but often business is looking more for clarity to turn a scientifically sound direction into a workable business strategy. When it comes to solutions, science can help define the problem, while business can say what is possible. But then we want to be sure that business goes in the right direction and doesn’t create unintended consequences elsewhere, and that is where science is also important.</P><P>That is what I mean by co-designing solutions The fundamental research helps define the problem, but the vital next step is where both academic science and business can come together. What can be done about it? What are the possible business solutions?</P><P>The key phrase for me is “science-based targets, science-based solutions.&quot;</P><P><EM>This interview was originally published on <STRONG><A href=""http://futureearth.org/"" target=""_blank"">http://futureearth.org/</A></STRONG></EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""bottom-content-block""><SECTION class=""zone zone-pre_footer""><DIV class=""bm-block bm-twig_block bm-vt-twig_block ""><SECTION class=""newsletter-subscriber""><DIV class=""container""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-sm-7 col-md-5 col-md-offset-1""><H3 class=""title"">Stay on top of our latest news by subscribing to our Sustain newsletter</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class=""zone zone-footer""><DIV class=""bm-block bm-twig_block bm-vt-twig_block ""><FOOTER class=""main-footer""><DIV class=""container""><DIV class=""as-table""><DIV class=""footer-copyright as-cell""><DIV class=""wrapper""><DIV class=""copyright""><DIV class=""ezxmltext-field""><P>Copyright © 2018World Business Council for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development</P><P>All rights reserved</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

For hours, a visitor passes plantation after plantation — here palm oil, there paper pulp — all the way to a small, protected forest ring around the lake.   </P><P>Global demand for forest commodities has devastated major portions of the world’s third-largest tropical forest, with Indonesia losing more than <A href=""http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&amp;series=AG.LND.FRST.K2&amp;country"">100,000 square miles of woodlands and peatlands</A> — an area larger than the United Kingdom — from 1990 to 2015, dealing a huge blow to one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots. The island of Sumatra alone <A href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/7/3/034010#erl428965t2"">lost 29,000 square miles</A> — about one-third of its forests — from 1990 to 2010.</P><P>Seven years ago, this relentless toll led Indonesia to declare a moratorium on logging new concessions in undisturbed tropical forests and peatlands — a move seen as critical in stemming forest loss and the accompanying fires, haze, and greenhouse gas emissions. That it came shortly after a <A href=""https://www.pri.org/stories/2010-06-22/norway-pledges-1-billion-stop-indonesias-deforestation"">$1 billion dollar pledge</A> from the government of Norway as part of the then-nascent Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) program, led many to hope that this was an important step toward reversing decades of deforestation in Indonesia. Adding to the momentum were zero-deforestation pledges from companies like <A href=""https://www.asiapulppaper.com/sustainability"">Asia Pulp &amp; Paper </A>and the <A href=""https://blog.conservation.org/2013/05/can-consumer-goods-companies-achieve-zero-deforestation-by-2020-2/"">Consumer Goods Forum</A>, which includes major palm oil buyers such as Mars, PepsiCo, and Proctor &amp; Gamble.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">At least 10,000 square miles of primary forest and peatlands — the equivalent of five islands the size of Bali — have disappeared since the moratorium.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>Nearly seven years after the declaration of the moratorium, however, the initiative has failed to stem the loss of forests and peatlands across the Indonesian archipelago. Satellite monitoring shows that palm oil and paper plantations continue to expand, with at least 10,000 square miles of primary forest and peatland — the equivalent of five islands the size of Bali — disappearing since the moratorium went into effect, according to <A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/seasia/Press-Centre/Press-Releases/Six-Years-of-Moratorium/"">one analysis</A>. In 2015, a massive El Niño-fueled <A href=""http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/12/01/indonesias-fire-and-haze-crisis"">fire event</A> — linked to burning for land-clearing — was believed to be the worst in Indonesian history, emitting an estimated <A href=""http://www.globalfiredata.org/updates.html"">1,750 million metric tons of <mark>CO2</mark></A> into the atmosphere — <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changenews.com/2018/01/24/germany-announces-<mark>carbon</mark>-emission-rise-second-year-row/"">nearly twice what Germany does</A> in a year, according to <A href=""http://www.globalfiredata.org/updates.html"">T</A><A href=""http://www.globalfiredata.org/updates.html"">he Global Fire Emissions Database</A>.
  </P><P>Following the moratorium, says Asep Komarudin, Forest Campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia, “there were no significant improvements in Indonesia’s natural resource governance, particularly in the forestry sector.”</P><P>Indeed, several years ago, Indonesia became the <A href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/n<mark>climate</mark>2277"">world leader in deforestation</A>, overtaking Brazil. Erik Meijaard, a conservation scientist who founded the <A href=""http://www.borneofutures.org/about.html"">Borneo Futures</A> initiative, says he has seen little change in Indonesian Borneo, where palm oil plantations continue to expand.</P><P>“If fact, there was a marked increase of deforestation after 2010… you get a very rapid expansion of the oil palm industry into forest areas, so if a moratorium was called in 2011, it didn’t seem to have an impact on the oil palm sector at least,” said Meijaard. <A href=""http://www.globalforestwatch.org/country/IDN?widget=treeLoss#treeLoss"">Data from Global Forest Watch</A> shows a similar pattern – little change in deforestation rates across the country since the moratorium went into effect.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--imageBlock article__block--align-full article__block--has-caption-or-credit""><FIGURE class=""article__figure""><FIGCAPTION class=""article__figcaption""><P class=""article__figcaption-p""><SPAN class=""article__caption"">Forest loss (areas in pink) in Indonesia from 2001 to 2016.</SPAN><SPAN class=""article__credit""><A href=""http://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/6/0.45/110.30/IDN/grayscale/loss?tab=analysis-tab&amp;begin=2001-01-01&amp;end=2017-01-01&amp;threshold=30"">Global Forest Watch</A></SPAN></P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>The reasons for this are manifold. First, there is the weakness of the moratorium itself, which was only a so-called Presidential Instruction, not a legally binding statute, meaning it lacked strong enforcement mechanisms. Moreover, the moratorium only applied to new concessions, not existing concessions that had already been ceded to companies and smallholders, but had not yet been cut down or burned. Adding to the moratorium’s ineffectiveness are ongoing problems with corruption, and the drive — particularly after the election of Joko “Jokowi” Widodo to the presidency in 2014 — to rapidly expand the economy. Moreover, government weakness and inefficiency also have meant that Norway’s pledged funds have scarcely been used to protect forests.   </P><P>Moreover, the zero-deforestation pledges made by corporations have not yet had a major impact. A study published earlier this year in <EM><A href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-017-0061-1"">Nature <mark>Climate Change</mark></A></EM> analyzed pledges from 450 companies and found that the majority were insufficient in their scope to meaningfully reduce deforestation on their own. The report’s authors argued that companies also need to push governments at all levels to crack down on deforestation globally.</P><P>Some experts say that while Indonesia’s progress is disappointing, fixing decades of forestry mismanagement in a few years was always an impossible task. They also note that deforestation rates have come down from their peak in the 1990s and early 2000s.</P><P>“The very important steps in the right direction that Indonesia has taken are unfairly characterized as failures because the whole big ship has not turned around yet,” said Jonah Busch, an environmental economist and a visiting fellow at the <A href=""https://www.cgdev.org/"">Center for Global Development</A>. “If there hadn’t been a moratorium, deforestation might have been even higher.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">A recent study found that nearly 150,000 orangutans had been lost in Borneo from 1999 to 2015, chiefly due to habitat loss.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>The problem, conservationists say, is that the necessary changes are not happening fast enough to protect Indonesia’s landscapes and biodiversity.

Large-scale fires and haze events began only after the timber boom of the 1970’s, and were exacerbated by expansion of palm oil and pulpwood plantations. Fires now occur nearly yearly and are why Indonesia is regularly one of the top five countries in the world for greenhouse gas emissions.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--imageBlock article__block--align-left article__block--has-caption-or-credit""><FIGURE class=""article__figure""><FIGCAPTION class=""article__figcaption""><P class=""article__figcaption-p""><SPAN class=""article__caption"">One of 73 fires detected on peatland or in forests early last month that caused haze on the island of Sumatra. </SPAN><SPAN class=""article__credit"">WAHYUDI/AFP/Getty</SPAN></P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>This is because much of Sumatra and Kalimantan, the two islands where the bulk of deforestation has taken place, are composed primarily of peatlands.

To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.

So even given those uncertainties, the fact that BlackRock would be so outspoken has garnered quite a bit of buzz and attention. </P><H3 id=""Th7ldt"">BlackRock manages an enormous amount of money</H3><P id=""924DjW"">BlackRock is the largest investment management company in the world. The company, founded in 1988 by Fink and seven others, sells a variety of investment products, including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and 401(k) plans, and per its <A href=""http://ir.blackrock.com/Cache/1001230787.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=1001230787&amp;iid=4048287"">most recent quarterly regulatory filing</A> has about $6.3 trillion in assets under management.</P><P id=""LqstBO"">Like competitors Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors, the bulk of BlackRock’s investment is in passive funds that track indexes such as the S&amp;P 500. Such funds are <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-corporate-power-brokers-passive-investors-1477320101"">increasingly the default investing option</A> for individual investors and big pension funds and own consistently growing chunks of many publicly traded large companies. In other words, BlackRock is a major power broker.</P><P id=""jr1nbd"">As Sorkin <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/business/dealbook/blackrock-laurence-fink-letter.html"">notes</A>, BlackRock and companies like it have traditionally been passive investors, doing little to pressure the leaders of the companies in which they’re invested. </P><P id=""7kIEEc"">Activist investors, by contrast — people like Bill Ackman, Carl Icahn, and Paul Singer — seek to hold companies accountable by launching activist campaigns for change or, sometimes, selling their shares. Activists say they are looking out for shareholders by addressing lackadaisical management and pushing companies to innovate and change — they propose maneuvers such as breakups and share buybacks and often seek to get representation on boards of directors. Detractors say that activist investors encourage short-termism and prioritize making a quick buck over looking out for the companies in the long-term.  </P><P id=""qNMn8O"">Fink has historically been critical of activist investors but has begun to soften his stance. “The role of activists is getting larger, not smaller,” he said at a conference hosted by <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-mobil-<mark>climate</mark>change-blackrock/blackrock-urges-exxon-to-disclose-more-about-<mark>climate</mark>-change-related-risks-idUSKBN19100N"">Reuters</A> in November, adding, “in many cases their role is a good one.”</P><P id=""2sjPZb"">BlackRock has urgedoil giant Exxon to be more open about the effects of <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-mobil-<mark>climate</mark>change-blackrock/blackrock-urges-exxon-to-disclose-more-about-<mark>climate</mark>-change-related-risks-idUSKBN19100N""><mark>climate change</mark></A> on its business and criticized its board members’ lack of engagement with shareholders. It has also supported some activist investors in their campaigns, including Nelson Peltz at Procter &amp; Gamble and Ackman at ADP.</P><P id=""7a9OG9"">In his Tuesday letter, Fink notes that in its passive investments, BlackRock has less ability to push for change beyond engaging with companies and shareholder votes at annual meetings. </P><P id=""GWvftZ"">But he also makes a point to say that BlackRock also manages $1.7 trillion in active funds and “can choose to sell the securities of a company if we are doubtful about its strategic direction or long-term growth.”</P><H3 id=""IzP0Wo"">When someone who controls as much money as Fink does speaks, Wall Street tends to listen</H3><P id=""jD7BdS"">Beyond active investments, Fink seems to indicate BlackRock will be taking a more proactive role in casting proxy votes at annual meetings, where shareholders can vote on a wide range of issues, including executive compensation, sustainability efforts, and directorships. BlackRock hasn’t traditionally wielded its voting power very forcefully, although in recent years that’s begun to change. </P><P id=""CZpELE"">“The time has come for a new model of shareholder engagement — one that strengthens and deepens communication between shareholders and the companies that they own,” Fink writes, arguing that if engagement is to be meaningful and productive, it “needs to be a year-round conversation about improving long-term value.”</P><P id=""RBjcJW"">There are signals that beyond BlackRock that times could be changing when it comes to shareholders holding corporations accountable. </P><P id=""B5yvbL"">A majority of shareholders in <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxonmobil-<mark>climate</mark>/exxon-shareholders-approve-<mark>climate</mark>-impact-report-in-win-for-activists-idUSKBN18R0DC"">Exxon</A> and <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/occidental-shareholders-vote-for-<mark>climate</mark>-proposal-1494616669"">Occidental Petroleum</A>, for example, recently voted in favor of the companies assessing the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on their businesses. More broadly, <A href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sri.asp"">socially responsible investing</A> has been on the rise and, along with it, more attention from shareholders on how what companies do might affect the world around them.</P><H3 id=""GQY5Nm"">It’s not clear what exactly BlackRock is looking for — or what they’ll do if they don’t find it</H3><P id=""3fMu3N"">Fink makes some reference to where he believes companies should be focusing in their long-term strategies — items such as wage growth, automation, and <mark>climate change</mark> — but exactly what he is looking for, or what BlackRock intends to do about it, is largely unclear. He also doesn’t downplay the importance of profits but instead seems to imply money-making and acting with a responsibility to society are intertwined.</P><P id=""DxuGuz"">The letter could be read as a threat not to invest in companies that behave badly, especially given Fink’s point that BlackRock has $1.7 trillion in active investments. But it’s also not clear how Fink defines good and bad behavior, and he does not overtly outline what the consequences may be. </P><P id=""TDMVRk"">“For the world’s largest investor to say it aloud — and declare that he plans to hold companies accountable — is a bracing example of the evolution of corporate America,” Sorkin writes, noting that BlackRock is adding staff to hold companies accountable. </P><P id=""TYisVv"">Some investors haven’t been so receptive of Fink’s message. Sam Zell, a billionaire investor who founded investment firm Equity Group Investments, in an appearance on <A href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/16/sam-zell-blackrock-ceo-fink-is-hypocritical-to-push-social-responsibility.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain"">CNBC</A> on Tuesday said Fink is “extraordinarily hypocritical” in pushing social responsibility. “Either they’re a passive fund that follows the market or they’re a leader that’s setting the tone,” he said, arguing that BlackRock can’t have it both ways. “I didn’t know Larry Fink had been made God.”</P><P id=""RbwUKc"">Ultimately, the impact of Fink’s letter and BlackRock’s supposed shift in thinking won’t be about words in a letter to CEOs — it will be about the firm’s actions.</P><P id=""nu2zAr"">“I appreciated today’s letter, particularly the encouragement not to ‘succumb to short-term pressures to distribute earnings,’” said Rosanna Landis Weaver, program manager at shareholder advocacy group As You Sow, which promotes environmental and social corporate responsibility, in an email, adding that she took his words to be a reference to stock buybacks and dividends — measures often designed to placate shareholders without boosting the long-term value of a company. </P><P id=""pO31qh"">But, she said, the larger issue in her view is executive compensation and how much corporate executives are paid. “BlackRock has a poor record on voting on exorbitant compensation plans, we hope that will change,” she said. “I have no reason to doubt Fink’s sincerity, but the ‘proof is in the pudding,’ and the only view we have of the pudding is the voting.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Traditionally, a utility agrees to buy power for a long time from a generator, giving the builder of an energy plant the stability to attract financing for its construction. The utility then resells power to its customers.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-7b9ec817-6abc-c1c4-a66b-1ed4ff924b4e"">But in PPA 2.0, big customers started asking independent renewable power developers to build the installations, usually off-site and sometimes not even in the same state.

Even the most basic information on women and girls is often lacking: when they are born, how many hours they work, if and what they earn, whether they’ve experienced violence, and the cause of death. We have virtually no gender-disaggregated data on issues that disproportionately affect women and girls. This perpetuates women’s being undervalued in society and ensures huge potential goes untapped.</P><P>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation announced USD 80 million of funding in support of programs that boost gender equality, including programmes that aim to close the gender data gap. Part of this funding is dedicated to UN Women’s flagship programme initiative “Making every woman and girl count”. The programme is being implemented across 12 countries over five years and supports the monitoring and implementation of the SDGs through better production and use of gender statistics.</P><P>Guided by the belief that every life has equal value, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation works to help all people lead healthy, productive lives. In developing countries, it focuses on improving people’s health and giving them the chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty. In the United States, it seeks to ensure that all people—especially those with the fewest resources—have access to the opportunities they need to succeed in school and life. Based in Seattle, Washington, the foundation is led by CEO Sue Desmond-Hellmann and Co-chair William H. Gates Sr., under the direction of Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett.</P><P style=""text-align: right;"">(<A href=""#intro"">return to top</A>)</P><H2 id=""Elizabeth-Arden"">Elizabeth Arden</H2><P>To further the cause of women’s empowerment championed by Ms. Elizabeth Arden herself, the iconic beauty brand launched the <A href=""https://www.elizabetharden.com/march-on.html"">March On campaign</A> in support of UN Women in March 2018. The campaign is embodied by the brand’s Storyteller-in-Chief, Reese Witherspoon—Academy Award–winning actress, producer, and entrepreneur, and co-founder of the Time’s Up initiative—who has been a passionate advocate for women.</P><P>To introduce the March On platform, a limited-edition lipstick in Elizabeth Arden’s signature red has been sold around the world, with 100 per cent of the proceeds benefiting UN Women. Under the multi-year commitment, the brand has pledged USD 1 million. The funds will support women’s issues around the world, sustain global programming while leading directly to the increased responsiveness and sustainability of field-level activities, and advocate for women and girls to help make their equal participation a reality. Future March On initiatives will be announced in the coming months.</P><P style=""text-align: right;"">(<A href=""#intro"">return to top</A>)</P><H2 id=""ford"">Ford Foundation</H2><P>UN Women’s partnership with the Ford Foundation spans multiple countries and projects while focusing on areas critical to gender equality and women’s empowerment. In the past, the Foundation’s support has included advancing evidence-based advocacy in China, and mainstreaming gender-responsive budgeting in India. The partnership has achieved strong results; for example, our work in India resulted in the gender-responsive analysis of agriculture and urban development sectors, which led to evidence generation on gender-responsive budgets, plans and programmes.</P><P>The Ford Foundation’s current contributions include supporting UN Women in responding to the outbreak of the Zika virus in Brazil, building socio-economic resilience and protection of Syrian women refugees and vulnerable Lebanese women in host communities that are affected by the Syrian crisis, strengthening gender-responsive budgeting in India and Sri Lanka, conducting anti-domestic violence work and youth leadership trainings in China, and advocating on accelerating change to end child marriage and early unions in Latin America and Caribbean.</P><P style=""text-align: right;"">(<A href=""#intro"">return to top</A>)</P><H2 id=""osf"">Open Society Foundation (OSF)</H2><P>Agriculture is one of the most important areas of women’s work globally, with more than one third of employed women working in the agriculture sector. Yet agricultural policies and investments tend to be gender-insensitive. While women farmers are at the forefront of coping with the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> and natural disasters, they usually have the least access to critical information that could help them.</P><P>UN Women’s flagship programme initiative on “Women’s empowerment through <mark>climate</mark>-resilient agriculture” is based on UN Women’s experience that strengthening resilience requires an integrated approach that simultaneously addresses the structural barriers women farmers face within the context of a changing <mark>climate</mark>. OSF’s funding is directed towards the “Global policy support project”, which is supporting the implementation of the flagship programme by developing methodologies to assess the gender gap and improve data collection, providing technical assistance, building global and regional partnerships, convening communities of practice, and ensuring knowledge management.</P><P>OSF is also supporting UN Women’s flagship report “Progress of the world’s women 2018–2019: Families in a changing world”, which seeks to answer how laws, policies and public action can support families in ways that enable women’s rights to resources, bodily integrity and voice.</P><P style=""text-align: right;"">(<A href=""#intro"">return to top</A>)</P><H2 id=""png"">Procter &amp; Gamble</H2><P>UN Women’s partnership with Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) spans multiple countries and includes programming as well as advocacy initiatives. Currently, P&amp;G is supporting UN Women’s flagship programme Initiative “Stimulating equal opportunities for women entrepreneurs”. Leveraging P&amp;G’s expertise as an industry leader in implementing gender-responsive procurement policies, and its global network, UN Women and P&amp;G are collaborating at a global level to bring best practices and thinking on gender-responsive procurement to key suppliers of P&amp;G. The partnership includes a special focus on building an inclusive business environment for women, and supporting women entrepreneurs, especially small-scale suppliers, to access corporate value chains, including that of P&amp;G, with programmes currently in place in Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan and South Africa.</P><P>Simultaneously, P&amp;G is a founding member of UN Women’s <A href=""http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2017/6/press-release-in-cannes-un-women-ed-calls-to-eliminate-gender-stereotypes-in-advertising"">Unstereotype Alliance</A>, helping galvanize collective action to proactively address and eliminate gender stereotypes in advertising globally. P&amp;G has already been leading the way with progressive portrayals of women and girls in advertising campaigns, and demonstrating the importance of men in promoting gender equality. P&amp;G is also supporting UN Women’s “Tracking study on gender equality attitudes”, which will provide urgent data on attitudes towards gender equality and help inform corrective action through policy and education.</P><P>Previously, in the lead up to the 2016 Olympic Games, P&amp;G’s leading feminine care brand, Always, supported UN Women’s innovative pilot programme, “One win leads to another”, in Rio de Janeiro. The community-based sports programme reached young women and girls, including some of the most-at-risk adolescent girls, and built their confidence and leadership skills, and improved their ability to influence decisions that impact their lives at all levels.</P><P style=""text-align: right;"">(<A href=""#intro"">return to top</A>)</P><H2 id=""proya"">PROYA Cosmetics Co.

Organizations of all types are launching green campaigns—from the city of London’s Congestion Charge on automobiles, to <A href=""http://walmartstores.com/Sustainability/7986.aspx"" title=""Wal-Mart Stores Inc."">Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</A>’s push to sell organic <A href=""http://www.ssireview.org/topics/category/food"">foods</A>, to the University of Texas’s construction of <A href=""http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CategoryID=19"" title=""LEED green buildings"">LEED green buildings</A>. Consumers too are getting behind the idea of being greener. In almost every opinion poll, consumers say that they are very concerned about <mark>climate change</mark>. They worry about rising seas, declining air quality, shrinking animal habitats, lengthening droughts, and newly brewing diseases. And they connect the dots back to their own purchases, finds a 2007 McKinsey &amp; Company global survey of 7,751 consumers in eight major economies.<SUP>1</SUP>Our results show that a full 87 percent of these consumers are concerned about the <A href=""http://www.ssireview.org/topics/category/environment"">environmental </A>and social impacts of the products they buy.</P><P>But when it comes to actually buying green goods, words and deeds often part ways. Only 33 percent of consumers in our survey say they are ready to buy green products or have already done so. And, according to a 2007 <I>Chain Store Age</I> survey of 822 U.S. consumers, only 25 percent say they have bought a green product other than organic food or <A href=""http://www.ssireview.org/topics/category/energy"">energy </A>efficient lighting. By and large, consumers tend to ignore other Earth-friendly products such as carpets made from recycled fiber and energy-saving computers.</P><P>Even the green goods that have caught on have tiny market shares. Organic foods—which consumers buy more for their own health than for the environment’s—accounted for less than 3 percent of all food sales in 2006, according to the <I>Nutrition Business Journal</I>. In 2006, green laundry detergents and household cleaners made up less than 2 percent of sales in their categories. And despite their trendiness, <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_cars"" title=""hybrid cars"">hybrid cars</A> made up little more than 2 percent of the U.S. auto market in 2007, according to a report by J.D. Power and Associates.</P><P>As a result, consumers in the United States and other developed countries have done little to lighten their <mark>carbon</mark> footprints. Some of this lag between talking and walking could reflect consumers’ insincerity, laziness, posturing, or other unsavory traits. But much more of it is because businesses have not educated consumers about the benefits of green products and have failed to create green products that meet consumers’ needs.</P><P>Consumers want to act green, but they expect businesses to lead the way. According to our global survey, 61 percent of consumers say that corporations should take the lead in tackling the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>. To do this, businesses need to develop more and better Earth-friendly products. Some already are, but they are not doing a good job of marketing them, finds a <mark>Climate</mark> Group study, which discovered that two-thirds of American and British consumers cannot name a green brand. Similarly, the 2007 National Technology Readiness Survey of 1,025 U.S. adults found that more than two thirds of participants say they prefer to do business with environmentally <A href=""http://www.ssireview.org/topics/category/socially_responsible_business"">responsible companies</A>, but almost half say it is difficult to find green goods and services.</P><P>Corporations can reap multiple benefits by going green. They can reduce their energy consumption, lessen their risks, meet competitive threats, enhance their brands, and increase their revenues. Consider the success of <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_fluorescent_lamp"" title=""compact fluorescent lightbulbs"">compact fluorescent lightbulbs</A> (CFLs), for example. In 2005, sales of CFLs accounted for less than 5 percent of the total lightbulb market. But only two years later, in 2007—the year that the public woke up to the looming threat of <mark>climate change</mark>—CFLs captured an estimated 20 percent of the lightbulb market, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Companies that sell CFLs, like General Electric Co. (GE), have increased their revenues, enhanced their brands, and strengthened their competitive positions in the market.</P><P>To realize the true potential of the green market, businesses must help consumers change their behaviors. And that requires removing the hurdles between would-be green consumers’ intentions and actions. Based on McKinsey’s work with businesses and other organizations around the world, we have identified five of these hurdles. We also recommend five steps that businesses and other organizations should take to dismantle all of the barriers that prevent consumers from buying green.</P><P><B>WHY ECO’S A NO-GO</B></P><P>Our 2007 study of 7,751 consumers around the world identifies barriers to buying green at every stage of the purchase. First, consumers have to be aware that a product exists before they buy it. Yet many don’t even know about the green alternatives in many product categories. Next, consumers must believe that a product will get the job done. But many believe that green products are of lower quality than their more traditional “browner” counterparts. Consumers must then decide whether a product lives up to its green reputation. Yet many are skeptical about environmental claims, partly because they distrust corporations and the media. Finally, consumers must decide whether a product is worth the cost and effort needed to purchase it. But consumers often believe that the prices of green goods are too high, and have a hard time finding them anyway.</P><P>To increase the sales of environmentally sensible products, companies must remove these five barriers—namely, lack of awareness, negative perceptions, distrust, high prices, and low availability. In other words, they must increase consumers’ awareness of green products, improve consumers’ perceptions of eco-products’ quality, strengthen consumers’ trust, lower the prices of green products, and increase these products’ availability.</P><P>The importance of each barrier varies by product, industry, and geography. For instance, more than 90 percent of consumers who participated in the McKinsey global survey know about CFLs, so lack of awareness is not a barrier to their purchasing them. But many customers think CFLs are too expensive and of dubious quality. In other words, high price and negative perceptions impede these consumers’ progress toward a greener purchase. In contrast, only half of the participants in this study know about <mark>carbon</mark> credits, which are a way that an individual or business can lower its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. Companies that sell these credits invest the money in renewable energy, reforestation, and other activities that reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, offsetting the emissions of the individual or business that purchased the <mark>carbon</mark> credit.</P><P>Across regions, moreover, consumers have different concerns about price and quality within the same product category. In the retail sector, for example, 14 percent of U.S. consumers say they are willing to pay a premium for green products, compared to 26 percent in Brazil, according to the McKinsey global survey. In the petroleum sector, 7 percent of French consumers are willing to pay a premium, compared to 26 percent in India.</P><P>Although the barriers between green thoughts and acts vary by product, industry, and region, the need to remove all barriers does not. In other words, companies have to move customers through the entire purchasing process—from being aware of eco-friendly products, to considering their pros and cons, to paying for the products. Understanding these barriers is the first step to growing green consumers.</P><P><B>FIVE BARRIERS TO GREENING</B></P><P><B>Lack of Awareness</B> Our study and others (such as London-based Account Ability’s report “What Assures Consumers on <mark>Climate Change</mark>?”) show that consumers know about <mark>climate change</mark>, understand that reducing their own greenhouse gas emissions will help fight <mark>climate change</mark>, and want to join that effort. But these studies also show that consumers do not quite understand how to act on their greener impulses. More than one-third of consumers we surveyed say they would like to take action against <mark>climate change</mark> but do not know what to do.</P><P>For example, the top three ways for consumers to reduce their own emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (a greenhouse gas) are to drive a more fuel-efficient car, improve their home’s insulation, and reduce their consumption of beef. Yet the consumers in our study thought that using energy-efficient appliances and recycling were among the top three emission-cutting acts. (They correctly identified driving a more efficient car as one of the top three.) And although eating less beef is among the top three best acts of greenness, the fewest consumers knew how eco-friendly this behavior is.</P><P>Consumers are equally confused about buying green products—and with good reason. Many attempts to label green products are meaningless at best and bewildering at worst. For example, a current labeling program indicates how much <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide an item’s production, packaging, and shipment emitted—that is, its “<A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<mark>Carbon</mark>_footprint"" title=""<mark>carbon</mark> footprint""><mark>carbon</mark> footprint</A>.” But calculating <mark>carbon</mark> footprints requires some very fancy math and results in numbers that few people intuitively understand. “What does it mean to say a bag of chips contains 75 grams of <mark>carbon</mark>?” asked Steve Howard, CEO of the <mark>Climate</mark> Group, in a March 6, 2008, <I>BusinessWeek</I> article. “I have a PhD in environmental physics and it does not mean a thing to me.”</P><P><B>Negative Perceptions</B> Even when consumers can correctly identify environmentally sound products, the green label sometimes proves to be the kiss of death. Some green products—such as Toyota Motor Corp.’s <A href=""http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/"" title=""Prius automobile"">Prius automobile</A>—have become status symbols, but many environmentally friendly products suffer an image problem. According to the 2007 GfK Roper Green Gauge study of more than 2,000 Americans, fully 61 percent believe that green goods perform worse than conventional items. Indeed, early green products often trailed behind their conventional competition. Early hybrid cars, for example, had less power than non-hybrid cars. CFL light bulbs also had to overcome problems: Early versions were slow to light up, had weak light when they did illuminate, and didn’t fit properly into most normal light fixtures.</P><P><B>Distrust</B> Consumers doubt not only the quality of green products, but also their very greenness, according to the GfK Roper survey. Although they trust the environmental claims of scientists and environmental groups, they tend not to believe the claims of government, media, and business—and justifiably. A 2007 study by TerraChoice Environmental Marketing Inc. (<A href=""http://www.terrachoice.com/files/6_sins.pdf"" title=""“The Six Sins of Greenwashing”"">“The Six Sins of Greenwashing”</A>) examined 1,753 environmental product claims and found that all but one were misleading or just plain false. In the misleading category: Some companies tout product features that are actually mandated by law. For example, TerraChoice found insecticides, lubricants, oven cleaner gels, cleaners, and disinfectants all labeled as CFC-free. But no products sold today in the United States have CFCs, because the federal government banned the ozone-eating propellants almost three decades ago. Other companies mislead consumers by highlighting one positive product feature while not mentioning their other negative qualities. For instance, paper or lumber products tout their recycled content or <mark>sustainable</mark> harvesting without noting the impact of their manufacturing processes on air and water emissions or global warming. And in the just plain false category: A dishwasher detergent boasted on its 100 percent plastic container that it used 100 percent recycled paper.</P><P><B>High Prices</B> Consumers who get past the sometimes checkered history of eco-friendly products often encounter a fourth barrier: their frequently higher prices. Indeed, price is the largest barrier to buying green products, found the U.K. Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs in its 2007 survey of 3,600 U.K. consumers. Close to half of this survey’s participants want a two-year return on the premium price they pay for a product. Yet 70 percent of green appliances, including energy-efficient televisions, washers, and dryers, take longer to recoup their purchasers’ money. Solar power is another example where, according to our analysis of data from the California Energy Commission, a combination of recent technological advances, government subsidies, and good weather have helped reduce the payback period to less than 10 years in California, making residential photovoltaic usage a practical reality for some consumers but still an expensive luxury for others. Because consumers perceive the benefits of green goods to be small and long term, they often view the often higher costs of these products to be too high.</P><P><B>Low Availability</B> Having decided to buy Earth-friendly items, many consumers encounter a final hurdle: They can’t find them. Biofuel enthusiasts, for example, must often drive out of their way to fill up on their chosen fuel. Many energy-conscious homeowners have no other choice than to buy dirty power because their local utilities simply do not offer clean energy. And many contractors do not know where to purchase green building materials. The reason consumers cannot find these products is that businesses are not stocking them. In 2007, we did an informal survey of 23 grocery retailers in Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area. We found that fewer than half offered green products besides organic food and CFLs. Among the minority that did proffer eco-friendly nonfood items, only about 10 percent stocked more than one product.</P><P><B>BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS</B></P><P>Knowing what stops consumers from buying green products is only half the battle. The other half is knowing how to break down these barriers. Below are five steps for removing the hurdles between green thoughts and green acts. Companies first need to figure out which customers are likely to want which products. They must then examine how people in these different market segments make their purchasing decisions. No matter which barriers prove most important for a given market segment or product, however, businesses must address barriers in all areas before consumers will change their behaviors.</P><P><B>Educate Consumers</B> Because consumers are largely unaware of green alternatives, businesses first need to think of themselves as educators, not salespeople. And they must expand their lesson plans beyond their own products to the larger issues of <mark>pollution</mark>, <mark>climate change</mark>, overfishing, and other environmental problems. And nonprofits and government agencies also need to take up the cause of green education.</P><P>Consider the success of <A href=""http://www.energystar.gov/"" title=""Energy Star"">Energy Star</A>. This program, a joint effort launched by the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy in 1992, educates consumers about how energy-efficient products can reduce energy use, save money, and protect the environment. Every product that meets government energy-efficiency standards can carry the Energy Star label, which has gained widespread consumer recognition and trust. Because federal regulations mandated energy labels on certain appliances, almost half of the air conditioners sold in the United States in 2005 carried the Energy Star label. In addition, in 2005, close to 30 percent of all U.S. homes had energy-efficient refrigerators and washing machines, according to the Vermont Department of Public Service.</P><P>To cite another example: Procter &amp; Gamble Co.’s (P&amp;G) “<A href=""http://www.packagingnews.co.uk/news/737170/Procter---Gamble-unveils-<mark>sustainable</mark>-living-label/"" title=""Future Friendly"">Future Friendly</A>” campaign teaches consumers how they can have a positive impact on the environment by making their homes more energy efficient, using less water, and reducing the amount of household waste. Specific tips include washing clothes in cold water and drying them in the air rather than in a dryer. P&amp;G benefits because it refreshes its brand, enhances its reputation, and protects its market share from new environmentally friendly competitors.</P><P><B>Build Better Products</B> For consumers to improve their opinions of green products, companies must create ones that are equal to, or better than, conventional alternatives. Consumers still value performance, reliability, and durability much more than a product’s ecological soundness. Indeed, to overcome their image problem, green products must often outperform their traditional counterparts.</P><P>GE managed to do this with the CFLs. The first CFLs cost a lot more, and were harder to find than conventional bulbs. Now, they pay for themselves in five months, and are readily available. Wal-Mart has committed to sell 100 million CFLs in 2008 and displays them prominently on its shelves. CFLs piggybacked on Energy Star’s success with the “Change a Light, Change the World” campaign. This effort increased awareness of CFLs and resulted in 500,000 pledges to replace a traditional light bulb with an Energy Star CFL.</P><P>Toyota likewise had to tackle early perceptions that the Prius had less power than non-hybrid cars. Toyota did this by redesigning the Prius to meet performance and style preferences of consumers. The carmaker increased the horsepower and conducted a campaign promoting the vehicle as “quick, roomy, and economical.”</P><P><B>Be Honest</B> In recent years, consumers have caught companies red-handed at “greenwashing”—that is, claiming that their products are far more environmentally friendly than they actually are. To rebuild public trust, companies must inform the public about their true environmental impact, as well as about their attempts to reduce that impact. Many will need to identify and address specific historical concerns about their products or operations. Only then will consumers believe the company’s Earth-sparing claims.</P><P>In 2005, GE launched “<A href=""http://www.grist.org/news/muck/2005/05/10/little-ge/"" title=""Ecomagination"">Ecomagination</A>,” an initiative with the broad objective of meeting environmental challenges such as the need for clean water, renewable energy, and reduced emissions. Ecomagination covered GE’s efforts to enhance its investment in <mark>sustainable</mark> technologies and increase its revenues from <mark>sustainable</mark> products such as lower-emission aircraft engines, efficient lighting, wind turbines, and water purification technology. As part of the Ecomagination campaign, GE also undertook efforts to make its own operations more environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark>. One of the results of the program is that GE kept its greenhouse gas emissions flat in 2005, even as revenues rose.<SUP>2</SUP></P><P>Telling consumers they should act green when the company itself is making little effort to improve its own operations is asking for a backlash. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), a U.K. watchdog, received a fourfold increase in complaints about environmental claims in advertisements in 2007.<SUP>3</SUP> One offender, according to ASA, was the low-price airline Ryanair Ltd., which promoted itself as the industry leader in environmental efficiency. In 2007, however, the airline received significant negative press when CEO Michael O’Leary confessed that his claim that the airline had cut emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide by half over the past five years was an “error.”<SUP>4</SUP></P><P><B>Offer More</B> To increase sales of green products, companies must make sure that consumers understand the returns—both financial and environmental—on their investment. When consumers find it easy to track their savings from using a product, they are more willing to try new green products—especially those that cost more. They also feel more confident about their eco-friendly purchases when they understand how the products help the environment.</P><P>Many companies participate in Energy Star’s voluntary EnergyGuide labeling program. Labels placed on products in retail stores communicate the products’ annual energy use (in watts and dollars) and compares it to similar products. Presented in a simple and clear manner, the information helps consumers choose products that not only are energy efficient but also save them money. The Prius’s value goes well beyond functionality.</P><P>The Prius caught consumers’ imaginations because it had a unique and contemporary style that signaled the owners’ commitment to the environment. Its dashboard communicates fuel consumption and energy efficiency, thereby broadcasting the car’s environmental benefits. By contrast, Honda Motor Co.’s Accord hybrid, which looked more conventional and did not toot its own environmental horn, languished (and was eventually dropped in 2008). In 2006, Prius held 76 percent of the hybrid market; the Accord hybrid, which functioned just as well as the Prius, held just 12 percent.</P><P><B>Bring Products to the People</B> Companies cannot sell their products if consumers cannot find them. It sounds obvious, but many of today’s green products are not widely available. Even finding out how to get them is difficult.</P><P>Wal-Mart and GE have helped make CFLs a successful consumer product by making it easy for consumers to buy them. Wal-Mart put the bulbs in the most coveted place—at eye level on the top two or three shelves. An educational display from GE complements the attractive shelf placement. Toyota communicates its intent to make the Prius widely available by running ads that say: “We’ve significantly increased production on the hard-to-find, easy-to-drive Toyota Prius.” According to <I>AutoInsight</I>, Toyota has increased production of the Prius since 1999 by an average of 50 percent a year.</P><P><B>THE GREEN IMPERATIVE</B></P><P>Businesses alone cannot lead consumers from intention to action. In many instances, the government and the civil sector need to be heavily involved to achieve long-lasting changes in consumer behavior. Nevertheless, businesses should play a leading role in the green movement in order to shape their market opportunities and manage potential regulation of their industries.</P><P>Green products and services are only a niche market today, but they are poised for strong growth. Already, 33 percent of consumers say they are willing to pay a premium for green products, and another 54 percent care about the environment and want to help tackle <mark>climate change</mark>. Entering the green market can also improve companies’ reputations, thereby increasing the value of their brands. Some 70 percent to 80 percent of public companies’ valuation in American and Western European stock markets depends on expectations of the company’s cash flow beyond the next three years. Companies’ reputations strongly shape those expectations, and corporate citizenship is the top driver of reputation, according to the Reputation Institute’s 2007 global survey.</P><P>In addition, firms that have a strong position in the green market can stay ahead of regulation and protect their market share from competitors. More than 80 percent of 2,192 executives surveyed by <I>The McKinsey Quarterly</I> about <mark>climate change</mark> expect some form of <mark>climate change</mark> regulation within the next five years in countries where their companies operate.<SUP>5</SUP>European countries already have limits on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions through the 
<A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol"" title=""Kyoto Protocol"">Kyoto Protocol</A>, and a number of U.S. states have established similar systems. More than 600 mayors from around the world have committed their cities to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.</P><P>The most proactive companies will lead regulation, and may even push for stricter regulations that will put their less environmentally savvy competitors at a disadvantage. Newcomers, in turn, can steal market share from existing companies by appealing to the growing legions of green consumers. 
<A href=""http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/"" title=""Whole Foods Market Inc."">Whole Foods Market Inc.</A>, with its double-digit sales growth in the essentially flat supermarket industry, is a powerful example of a new entrant that is not only winning market share with a green and ethical offering, but also taking share in the premium segment of the market.</P><P>Companies may rightly ask whether cultivating green consumers is worth all the trouble. We believe that it is not only worth the trouble, but also imperative for success. Once businesses remove the obstacles between consumers’ desire to buy green and the actual follow-through of those sentiments, green products could experience explosive sales growth. What’s more, building a reputation as an Earth-friendly corporation can do much more than generate increased revenues from green products. The better a company’s reputation, the more talented the employees it can attract, the more loyalty it can inspire in its customers, and the more it can charge for its products.</P><P><I>This article has benefited from the thoughtful and ongoing insights of our fellow McKinsey &amp; Company colleagues, especially Nadeem Sheikh and Jessica Weisz.</I></P><P>Notes</P><OL><LI> The survey was conducted in Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
