Photo by Roger Kenny</P></DIV><P><STRONG>Food with quick-cooking properties can be a little intimidating</STRONG></P><P>Scallops are most definitely in this category. Mess up and the dish is spoiled and scallops are not exactly cheap to buy. Here’s the dilemma: we know that seafood raw or under-cooked can be dangerous, over-cooked they loose their delicate sweetness – even an experienced chef can deliver chewy scallops. Recently we watched as <mark>Michelin</mark> Star chef Kevin Thornton served scallops perfectly made in less than 5 minutes.</P><P>We were at the showrooms of De Deitrich at the KAL Advisory Centre, Citywest, Dublin where chef Kevin Thornton demonstrated his acknowledged cooking skills, swapping the restaurant kitchen for the new domestic range of intelligent cookers from De Deitrich. Yes, intelligent cookers, whatever next.</P><P><STRONG>So what do intelligent ovens do, how smart are they ?</STRONG></P><P>They can cook different types of food that need different cooking results. Use a 100% automatic cooking mode setting all the cooking parameters from time to the temperature, no preheating required – or choose a semi-automatic cooking mode – choose from up to 50 recipes, input the weight and the oven does the rest. Another 100% automatic function is for slow cooking which allows food to be cooked over a long period of time to maintain more flavour and tenderness. For pastry the system delivers 14 automatic pastry cooking methods or create your own recipe and let the oven do the rest.</P><P>I once left a pot of jam on a not-in-use cooking zone and and accidentally switched on that very zone – needless to say this did not end happily. The new De Deitrich hob would recognised that jar as a non-suitable object and refuse to cook, so eliminating that mishap.</P><P>These smart hobs will only activate when a suitable pan is placed on the cooking zone. There’s even a setting that takes away the guess work for boiling certain foods. Simply set the volume of water to be brought to the boil and once food is added just set the desired cooking time.</P><P>It was sort of encouraging for us home cooking amateurs to watch a renowned chef prepare a wild mushroom risotto topped with a parmesan tuile, sautéed scallops with a Noilly Prat sauce and more or less allow the oven take the strain. The latest De Dietrich collection has a variety of hobs, microwaves, extractor fans, dishwashers, washing machines, fridge freezers – and that ‘intelligent multifunction pyrolytic oven’ which was recently awarded the Red Dot Award for product design. Kevin talked about the new ovens, saying: “I particularly love the recipes feature as their accuracy is excellent. You can set the oven and let it do its work safe in the knowledge the dish will be perfectly cooked.”</P><P>As Kevin expertly prepared his ingredients and gave us the benefit of his expert tips, we watched, at the same time, as a De Deitrich oven pulled out all the stops to puff-up two lumps of dough into two different deliciously crispy golden loafs.</P><P>But back to the King Scallops that came to us all the way from the Atlantic fishing villages of the Beara Peninsula. Cleaned and washed, Kevin rubbed them with olive oil, then seasoned with salt and pepper. He heated a pan and sautéed the scallops; quickly browning them on both sides; placed in the oven at 170°C for just two minutes; removed and gave them a good squeeze of lemon. They were served with a Noilly Prat sauce made with vermouth, stock, crème fraîche and seasoning. The sauce is named for the Noilly Prat Vermouth but you’ll be forgiven for using another dry white vermouth. To make the sauce: pour the 600ml. stock into a a medium-sized saucepan. It is usually fish stock but Kevin thinks a chicken or vegetable stock is more suitable for the delicate taste of a scallop and in my humble opinion that makes good sense. Add 4tbsp crème fraîche or double cream and 4tbsp Noilly dry white vermouth, 85g butter cut into small pieces and a tsp of fresh thyme leafs and boil to reduced by three-quarters.</P><P>Chef Kevin Thornton with his partner Muriel, managed the once iconic Thornton’s Restaurant on St.Stephen’s Green Dublin for 26 years. It became the only Irish restaurant ever to have featured in Taste magazine’s World’s 50 Best Restaurants – it was ranked number 25. It closed in 2016 and Kevin and Muriel decided to establish Kevin Thornton Kooks concentrating on cooking masterclasses and high-end corporate and private catering ​ Kevin has become well known for his TV work including ‘No Experience Required’, ‘Guerrilla Gourmet’ and ‘Heat’ – all on RTE. Internationally too, on ‘Masterchef South Africa’ and ‘Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern’ on the Travel Channel. On radio he co-presenting ‘Foodtalk’ on Newstalk.</P><P>Bon appetit!</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

	    Continental is one company that is looking to dandelions as a new source of natural rubber.
        </DIV></DIV></A><P>WASHINGTON—<mark>Michelin</mark>'s recently announced Zero Deforestation program will have a major impact on both the procurement of natural rubber and the development of alternative natural rubber sources, according to industry sources. </P><P>To Michael Fraley, CEO of the guayule rubber development and commercialization firm PanAridus L.L.C., the Zero Deforestation program underlines the need both for preserving the rainforest and developing sources of NR other than <EM>Hevea brasiliensis.</EM></P><P>“Eighty-five to 90 percent of all <EM>Hevea </EM>comes from millions of small, individual growers in three or four countries,” he said. “We cannot sustain a system like that. “The rainforest has been drastically affected, and will continue to be if it continues to be depleted,” he said.</P><P>Katrina Cornish, endowed chair and Ohio Endowed Professor for Bioemergent Materials at Ohio State University, sees more and more small farmers in Southeast Asia switching from rubber to oil palm, which is more profitable. </P><P>Also, with <mark>climate change</mark>, the threat to the small area of land on which <EM>Hevea </EM>can grow becomes ever greater, she said.</P><P>“Depending on clonal <EM>Hevea </EM>for this crucial material is insane,” said Cornish, who leads a major research project in rubber dandelion development at OSU-Wooster Campus. “We have to have some biological diversity before disaster strikes.”</P><P>Zero Deforestation forms Section 2.1 of the 2016 edition of the <mark>Michelin</mark> Group's <EM><mark>Sustainable</mark> Natural Rubber Policy </EM>reference document. </P><P>“By all reasonable means, the Group ensures that the natural rubber it uses comes exclusively from plantations that fully comply with the zero deforestation principles,” the document said.</P><P>These principles include the complete protection and preservation of primary forests, as well as protection and preservation of High Conservation Value and High <mark>Carbon</mark> Stock forests, it said. </P><P>Section 4.1 of the reference document is titled “Increasing the Material Efficiency of Natural Rubber.” Using biomaterials and other alternative components to natural rubber is among the actions <mark>Michelin</mark> is exploring in this area, as well as reducing average tire mass; increasing tire durability; developing retreading and regrooving surfaces; and recycling both new and used materials during the production process. </P><P>Organizations such as Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund greeted <mark>Michelin</mark>'s Zero Deforestation announcement warmly. “The announcement by the <mark>Michelin</mark> Group to commit to a zero deforestation natural rubber procurement policy sends a strong signal to the entire rubber sector: it will soon be more difficult to sell natural rubber that contributes to deforestation,” said Cecile Leuba of Greenpeace France.</P><A href=""/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/RN/20161010/NEWS/310039999/H2/0/Peter-Zmolek.jpg&amp;cci_ts="" target=""_blank""><DIV class=""captioned-photo  right""><DIV class=""caption""><SPAN class=""photo-credit"">Photo by Continental</SPAN>
	    Continental's Peter Zmolek displays a harvest of dandelion roots.
        </DIV></DIV></A><P><mark>Michelin</mark> officials could not be reached for comment. Other tire makers issued statements regarding their sustainability activities. </P><P>Goodyear spoke of its participation in the International Rubber Study Group's <mark>Sustainable</mark> Natural Rubber Initiative, which was launched in 2013 with the purpose of creating <mark>sustainable</mark> natural rubber procurement. </P><P>“Goodyear is increasing its focus on sustainability in our materials, products, manufacturing processes and end uses,” said Dennis McGavis, Goodyear global vice president for environmental, health, safety and sustainability. </P><P>Bridgestone Americas Inc. has a very active sustainability program that includes research in both guayule and rubber dandelions. </P><P>One of the high points of Bridgestone's program is the Bridgestone Biorubber Process Research Center in Mesa, Ariz., and the nearby Agro Operation Guayule Research Farm in Eloy, Ariz. The tire maker unveiled prototype tires in October 2015 in which guayule rubber completely replaced <EM>Hevea, </EM>and said it is on track to make guayule available commercially by the early 2020s.</P><P>“Appreciating that the production of natural rubber is a very complex and fragmented system, Bridgestone takes a broad view of <mark>sustainable</mark> natural rubber, which includes not only deforestation, but also labor rights, land use, water use and quality, and many other critical elements,” the company said in a statement. </P><P>“Bridgestone recognizes the industry's responsibility to develop technologies and business practices that encourage conservation of earth's finite natural resources,” it said. </P><P>Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co. did not issue a statement, but pointed to the document on its website describing its corporate social responsibility and sustainability mission. </P><P>One of Cooper's chief efforts in this mission is its leadership in the Biomass Research and Development Initiative, in which its partners are PanAridus, Clemson University, Cornell University and the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. </P><P>Using guayule rubber provided by Pan-Aridus, Cooper made its first tires with guayule rubber components in 2014, and the following year hosted the tire industry's first ride-and-drive event on guayule tires.</P><P><STRONG>Researching rubber dandelion</STRONG></P><P>Meanwhile, Continental A.G. has put itself in the forefront of research into <EM>Taraxacum kok-saghyz, </EM>also known as the rubber dandelion. (The plant has commonly been called the Russian dandelion, but Ohio State's Cornish discourages that. “It's not really Russian,” she said.)</P><P>Continental recently announced it is earmarking $39 million to build a dedicated dandelion research facility in Anklam, Germany. The tire maker is developing dandelion rubber under the trade name “Taraxagum” and plans to introduce commercial dandelion rubber products in the next five to 10 years. </P><P>The biggest challenge to Conti's dandelion rubber commercialization plans is ensuring supply, according to Peter Zmolek, director of body compound and reinforcement development for Conti. </P><P>“It depends on the number of tires we decide to build, but we will not be limited by the number of tires once we have sufficient rubber we can harvest,” he said. </P><P>Conti's idea, according to Zmolek, is to plant dandelions close to production facilities, not only cutting down on transport costs but also reducing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions. The social, economic and environmental advantages of rubber dandelions are enormous, he said. </P><P>Zmolek said he could not speak to the issue of <mark>climate change</mark> involving <EM>Hevea, </EM>but noted that the enormous potential growing area for rubber dandelions makes them virtually <mark>climate change</mark>-proof.</P><P>“There is no concern for dandelions,” he said. “They are quite robust, and that is what makes them so attractive.”</P><P>Cornish also said rubber dandelions enjoy an advantage in a time of <mark>climate change</mark>, and added that guayule—which grows only in hot, dry <mark>climate</mark>s—should continue to have sufficient growing areas. </P><P>“Both crops have a good future,” she said. </P><P>Fraley sees his product not only as having a great future, but providing great value here and now. </P><P>“We don't have the luxury of promoting crops that need an abundance of water,” he said. “We've provided tons of seed and rubber. We are providing a consistent product—probably the highest-quality natural rubber in the world.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""right-column""><DIV class=""relatedStoriesWrapper""><SECTION><H1>Related Articles</H1></SECTION></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

<A href=""http://www.sfexaminer.com/author/robyn-purchia/"" title=""Posts by Robyn Purchia"" class=""author url fn"" rel=""author"">Robyn Purchia</A> on December 21, 2016 1:00 am</DIV><P>’Tis the season to eat, drink and be merry, and San Francisco’s restaurants are a great place to do all three. Amidst white tablecloths and the sound of cocktail shakers, the winter cold may seem far away. But each bite of warm bread and sip of wine connects patrons to the world outside their cozy booth — a world increasingly impacted by <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>Crops and livestock suffer from extreme and chaotic weather, which is already causing food to become scarcer and more expensive. The environment also suffers as our demands increase. Food must move beyond these roles of environmental victim and perpetrator. Thankfully, in The City, some big names in the restaurant industry are moving food toward a <mark>climate change</mark> solution.</P><P>“There is the possibility to make a lot of difference with menu choice,” Anthony Myint, a San Francisco restaurateur who champions environmental sustainability, told me.  </P><P>His menu at The Perennial in SoMa is an example. It offers warm slices of crunchy Kernza bread, a grain that draws <mark>carbon</mark> out of the air and stores it in the ground. Organic beef comes from Stemple Creek Ranch, which uses compost to enhance <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration. These ingredients not only reduce The Perennial’s <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, they also work to slow <mark>climate change</mark>. They demonstrate food as an environmental solution.</P><P>The optimistic, environmental ethos behind The Perennial is certainly commendable. But it’s unrealistic to expect every restaurant to adopt the same comprehensive approach — at least, immediately.</P><P>Myint, along with Chris Ying of Lucky Peach and <mark>carbon</mark> emissions expert Peter Freed, developed another way for more mainstream restaurants to make a difference. Their nonprofit, Zero Foodprint, helps restaurants calculate their <mark>carbon</mark> footprint and figure out practical ways to reduce it. Participating restaurants usually purchase <mark>carbon</mark> credits to offset their operational emissions.</P><P>“The purchase of <mark>carbon</mark> credits, in general, supports projects that verifiably reduce emissions,” Elizabeth Singleton, executive director of Zero Foodprint, told me. “At the end of the day, what we’re talking about is the true cost of food. We’re trying to price <mark>carbon</mark> back into food.”</P><P>The prices on Mission Chinese Food’s menu reflect that cost. Zero Foodprint found the restaurant’s ingredients accounted for 78 percent of its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. Among the ingredients, beef and lamb were the biggest offenders. Mission Chinese Food raised the price of these dishes by a dollar to account for their <mark>carbon</mark> cost. The small price hike went to purchasing <mark>carbon</mark> credits and more <mark>sustainable</mark> ingredients. </P><P>But the price hike does more than just account for the true cost of beef and lamb — it has an affect on people who eat at the restaurant. Like a <mark>carbon</mark> tax, it gently guides cost-conscious people to make better choices while ordering. It subtly raises awareness among those raising their Tsingtao beers and chowing down on Mission Chinese Food’s deliciously spicy dishes. It inspires change.</P><P>“The most impactful [way to lead change] is helping get the word out there, talking about it,” said Chef Corey Lee of San Francisco’s acclaimed <mark>Michelin</mark>-star restaurant, Benu. </P><P>Zero Foodprint just completed a <mark>carbon</mark> assessment at Benu and is completing assessments at Chef Lee’s other restaurants, Monsieur Benjamin in Hayes Valley and In Situ in SFMOMA.</P><P>The collaboration between Zero Foodprint and Chef Lee will hopefully get more chefs involved. Not only is Chef Lee renowned in the industry, he also works with the chefs who feature dishes at In Situ. He can encourage them to reduce the impact of their ingredients by using different suppliers, purchasing <mark>carbon</mark> credits and including price hikes that will reach more customers. </P><P>These chefs and restaurateurs are in a unique position to move food toward a <mark>climate change</mark> solution. Of course, the government could impose a hamburger tax, and grassroots groups and religious organizations could boycott. But relying on restaurants to lead makes the most sense: Not only do they know food, they also know how much we love it.<EM>

  (12 December 2015) DSM,together with a broad alliance of 54
  global companies from all continents and a broad range of industries,
  calls for ambitious <mark>climate</mark> action as a basis for future economic
  success. In a joint declaration, DSMand the other signatory
  businesses particularly address the twenty most industrialized
  countries accounting for 74% of the global emissions to use the G20 as
  a forum to come up with concrete long-term measures to accelerate the
  global de<mark>carbon</mark>ization while inviting other countries to join efforts.
  Measures include a phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies by 2025, an
  adequate price on <mark>carbon</mark> and clarity on <mark>climate</mark>-related financial risks.</DIV></DIV><DIV class=""par parsys""><DIV class=""text parbase section""><P>In the statement, the companies call for framework conditions that lay the foundation for a pathway towards limiting global temperature rise to well below 2° Celsius and allow them to actively contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. They argue that a low-<mark>carbon</mark> development will secure jobs and prosperity, kicking off a new wave of <mark>innovation</mark> and entrepreneurship. The undersigned companies represent more than 1.9 million employees worldwide and total revenues of more than €676 billion, equivalent to a fourth of the GDP of France and more than twice of Denmark’s GDP.</P><P>The business coalition also addresses Heads of States who gather tomorrow at the “One Planet Summit” in Paris. They call on governments to keep up the momentum of the Paris Agreement when developing and implementing long-term de<mark>carbon</mark>ization strategies. At the same time, the signatory businesses reaffirm their deep commitment to proactively tackling <mark>climate change</mark> in their own activities and policies, and take into account frameworks supporting business <mark>climate</mark> action such as internal <mark>carbon</mark> prices, TCFD implementation in their own reporting, as well as science-based targets.</P><P>Feike Sijbesma, CEO and Chairman of the DSM Managing Board, commented: “<I>The private sector strongly supports the three goals of the One Planet Summit: to scale solutions, to step up our efforts and to collaborate in partnership.

For the first time, a major tire manufacturer has embraced a zero deforestation policy for all natural rubber purchases. Moreover, the company made a strong commitment to human rights and social protections, especially for indigenous people living where rubber is farmed.</P><P class=""p-text"">But how will American tire and car companies respond? They can follow in the wake of the French tire giant and make good on their many pronouncements about sustainability, or get left behind while <mark>Michelin</mark> and other European companies lead the charge and reap the benefits. Will Goodyear, Tesla, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler make us proud?</P><P class=""p-text"">Much hangs in the balance. When we buy tires that are unsustainably sourced, we’re paying for the materials inside our wheels, and the dirty practices that led up to our purchase: namely deforestation and human rights abuses. Large-scale industrial rubber plantations are driving a globally significant surge in deforestation and scientists believe that projected global rubber demand could swallow up between 10.6 and 21 million acres of land by 2024 (nearly the size of Indiana). Rubber plantations are biological deserts in comparison with the natural forests they raze and replace — many of which are hotspots for biodiversity and home to species like endangered orangutans, macaques and gibbons. As a result, we’re standing by as forests are decimated, vital ecosystems threatened, and wildlife pushed closer to critically-endangered status.</P><P class=""p-text"">Alongside environmental threats, rubber-driven deforestation in places like Burma and Cambodia can hurt people too, in large part because it triggers land-grabbing. Human rights violations linked to land grabs and evictions hit the impoverished and vulnerable hardest, particularly indigenous groups who have lived in forests for generations. Activists who stand up for their land rights can face abuses like arbitrary arrests and police brutality.</P><P class=""p-text"">Despite the numerous threats that rubber poses to forests, the people who dwell there, biodiversity, and the fight against <mark>climate change</mark>, the rubber industry has not attracted conservation efforts on a scale even close to those devoted to the palm oil industry.</P><P class=""p-text"">With <mark>Michelin</mark>’s announcement this past weekend, all this may change. The tire-making industry accounts for about 60 percent of global rubber consumption, and the top five tire companies—Bridgestone/Firestone, Goodyear, <mark>Michelin</mark>, Pirelli and Continental — account for 35 percent of all consumption. If the big five and the car companies that buy their tires adopt meaningful human rights and environmental protection measures, we will see tremendous positive change for the planet’s tropical forests and the people who dwell in them.</P><P class=""p-text"">I am eager to see the American tire and car industries get on the right side of history where rubber is concerned. But there is much more to be done if we are to protect the world’s endangered forests.</P><P class=""p-text"">Next time you replace your tires, remember that you too have an opportunity to support <mark>sustainable</mark> development instead of deforestation.</P><P class=""p-text p-text-last"" id=""article-body-p-last""><SPAN class=""-newsgate-paragraph-cci-endnote-contact-"">Henry Waxman is chairman of <A href=""http://waxmanstrategies.com"" alt=""http://waxmanstrategies.com"" title=""http://waxmanstrategies.com"">Waxman Strategies</A>.</SPAN></P><DIV id=""module-position-Q4NSb9V7R3s"" class=""story-asset inline-share-tools-asset""><DIV class=""inline-share-tools asset-inline-share-tools asset-inline-share-tools-bottom""><SPAN class=""inline-share-btn inline-share-btn-facebook"" data-share-method=""facebook"" data-uotrack=""InlineShareFacebookBtn""><SPAN class=""inline-share-btn-label inline-share-btn-label-facebook"">CONNECT</SPAN></SPAN><A class=""inline-share-btn inline-share-btn-twitter"" data-share-method=""twitter"" data-uotrack=""InlineShareTwitterLink"" data-popup-width=""550"" data-popup-height=""450"" href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//detne.ws/28NaxIN&amp;text=<mark>Michelin</mark>%20reinvents%20the%20wheel&amp;via=detroitnews"" target=""_blank"" data-popup="""" rel=""nofollow""><SPAN class=""inline-share-btn-label inline-share-btn-label-twitter"">TWEET</SPAN></A><A class=""inline-share-btn inline-share-btn-linkedin"" data-share-method=""linkedin"" data-popup-width=""600"" data-popup-height=""455"" data-uotrack=""UtilityBarFlyoutLinkedInLink"" href=""http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//detne.ws/28NaxIN&amp;mini=true"" target=""_blank"" data-popup="""" rel=""nofollow""><SPAN class=""inline-share-btn-label inline-share-btn-label-linkedin"">LINKEDIN</SPAN></A><SPAN class=""inline-share-btn inline-share-btn-comments"" data-share-method=""comments"" data-uotrack=""InlineShareCommentsBtn""><SPAN class=""inline-share-count inline-share-count-comments"">

Transport, which is responsible for 23 per cent of worldwide <mark>CO2</mark> emissions, is at the forefront of concerns. Electromobility is generously served up as an elixir on occasions such as this, however battery driven electric cars remain a niche market. An alternate form of electric propulsion, one that many in the UK first saw when James May tested the Honda FCX Clarity on Top Gear back in 2008, may hold the key to the door of high volume uptake. This is hydrogen fuel cell, a technology that tyre maker <mark>Michelin</mark> actively supports.</P><P>Commenting that hydrogen “ticks all the boxes in terms of <mark>Michelin</mark>’s vision of <mark>sustainable</mark> mobility,” the tyre maker sees the technology as a means of overcoming the limitations currently associated with electromobility. These well-known shortcomings are battery range and recharging time, constraints that effectively restrict battery electric vehicles to urban use and short commutes. Hydrogen technology removes these limitations; at up to around 375 miles, a hydrogen electric vehicle’s range is comparable to that of a petrol vehicle, and filling up with hydrogen at a dedicated service station takes only three to five minutes. A further advantage is that filling up a hydrogen electric vehicle doesn’t place a burden upon the local electricity grid.</P><P>Hydrogen fuel cells operate by bringing hydrogen in contact with oxygen to produce electricity and water. Neither <mark>CO2</mark> nor other pollutants are emitted whilst a fuel cell is running, however <mark>Michelin</mark> comments that the H2 (dihydrogen) needed for operation is still typically produced using a method that generates greenhouse gases. More than 90 per cent of hydrogen is produced from hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s using the steam reforming method. Although this is an inexpensive process, <mark>Michelin</mark> notes that hydrogen can also be produced in an entirely <mark>carbon</mark>-free way by means of electrolysis of water, using renewable energies such as solar or wind power.</P><P>Three countries – Japan, Korea and China – currently lead the world in terms of hydrogen. Several manufacturers from these countries already have commercial models on the market, and all three countries have implemented a favourable tax regime or highly incentivised subsidy programmes for hydrogen. Europe currently lags behind Asia, however activities here are accelerating, and more and more companies are now committing to this technology and are ready to make investments – <mark>Michelin</mark> is just one of these.</P><P>Research and development teams at <mark>Michelin</mark> have worked with hydrogen as an energy source for more than 15 years. The company claims it has “mastered the technology of the hydrogen fuel cell.” As a <A href=""https://www.tyrepress.com/2014/05/<mark>michelin</mark>-acquires-share-in-fuel-cell-firm/"" target=""_blank"">shareholder since 2014</A> and <A href=""https://www.tyrepress.com/2016/09/symbio-fcell-welcomes-<mark>michelin</mark>-was-main-shareholder-brings-new-investor-on-board/"" target=""_blank"">main shareholder as of last year</A>, <mark>Michelin</mark> works with Symbio FCell, creator of the first hydrogen range extender. This technology can be used to convert any electric vehicle into an electric/hydrogen hybrid, encouraging rapid adoption of this technology without needing to wait for the launch of new, dedicated models. <mark>Michelin</mark>’s IMECA subsidiary is working with Symbio FCell on the industrialisation of this technology. These efforts were helped in 2016 when green mobility company Engie took a minority share in Symbio, bringing with it its expertise in the <mark>carbon</mark>-free production of hydrogen and in distribution infrastructures.</P><P>Beyond its own research and that of Symbio, <mark>Michelin</mark> demonstrates its commitment to hydrogen fuel cell technology through its membership of the Hydrogen Europe FCHJU, which groups at European level all industries, research and national associations. <mark>Michelin</mark> additionally works with several French associations. It has also given its full support to the ‘Zero Emission Valley’ project in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of France. The region seeks to become a “spearhead” of hydrogen mobility in Europe and aims, through the project, to boost awareness and use of hydrogen mobility. The plan is to deploy 20 hydrogen stations and a fleet of 1,000 vehicles in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes between now and 2020.</P><P>Last but not least, <mark>Michelin</mark> is a partner of Swiss firm Green GT, which produces the world’s only electric hydrogen racing vehicle. By putting the hydrogen fuel cell up against the extreme conditions encountered in endurance races, <mark>Michelin</mark> anticipates it will be in a position to offer future customers every guarantee of safety and performance.</P><DIV class=""sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled""><DIV class=""robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing""><H3 class=""sd-title"">Share:</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

to confirm some type of accreditation system for tires when they are no longer new,” said Senard. “This isn’t a view shared globally, but from our point of view, if you can’t use a tire because it’s

<BODY><DIV id=""mainbody""><A href=""http://www.skepticalscience.com/Crichton_Aliens_Cause_Global_Warming.html""><H2>Crichton's 'Aliens Cause Global Warming'</H2></A><H4>Posted on 8 February 2011 by Alden Griffith</H4><P>In 2003, Michael Crichton delivered a <A target=""\"" href=""http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/Crichton2003.pdf"">lecture at Caltech titled &quot;Aliens Cause Global Warming&quot;</A>. This lecture has since circulated widely and its arguments often come up in critiques of <mark>climate</mark> science. An excerpt was even <A target=""\"" href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122603134258207975.html#articleTabs%3Darticle"">published posthumously in The Wall Street Journal</A>. I wish to comment briefly on two particular sections of the lecture: consensus and <mark>climate</mark> models.     </P><DIV><STRONG>On Consensus...</STRONG></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Although he never defines exactly what he means by &quot;consensus&quot;, Crichton's use of the term seems to rely on a limited and largely incorrect view of the scientific process. He attempts to portray the idea of consensus as irrelevant in science, and assumes that all of science boils down to clear, proven facts:  &quot;Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant.&quot;  Unfortunately, complex scientific topics do not fit this &quot;neat and simple&quot; model at all. <mark>Climate</mark> science is an amalgamation of many different investigators, examining many different lines of evidence that lend strong support to the conclusion that humans are modifying the <mark>climate</mark> system. This extensive field of research cannot, and will not, ever come down to one investigator being right or wrong. In this case, the <A target=""_self"" href=""https://skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus.htm"">vast majority of <mark>climate</mark> scientists agree</A> on several main conclusions that only emerge with the synthesis of <A target=""_self"" href=""https://skepticalscience.com/its-not-us.htm"">many independent lines of evidence</A>. The reality of <mark>climate</mark> science is that no single piece of evidence can solely support or refute the conclusions that have emerged. This is exactly why the concept of consensus is important - consensus emerges to indicate what is currently understood and what is not. Rather than being irrelevant as Crichton suggests, consensus is a real and fundamental part of science.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Crichton then argues that scientific consensus has a poor track record and points to examples where the &quot;consensus&quot; was eventually overturned. The implication is that the consensus isn't always correct. But none of his examples are good analogues for the current consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>. Previously held views on fever, diet, and geology were not based on a robust, mechanistic understanding of empirical evidence, and often rested upon long-held assumptions that had not, or could not, be formally tested. For example, the dominant paradigm in geology going into the 19th century was largely drawn from Biblical accounts of Noah's Flood. In the mid 19th century, Charles Lyell challenged this view with a theoretical framework of more gradual change based upon extensive observations. In the 20th century, Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift was indeed controversial at first, not because the consensus failed to &quot;acknowledge what any schoolchild sees&quot;, but because he did not have a robust mechanisms for why the continents should move, nor was there any evidence that the continents were indeed moving. With the accumulation of more independent lines of evidence and the development of a more mechanistic theory, the consensus around plate tectonics was eventually formed (even before the movement of continents was empirically observed). In his simplistic portrayal of consensus, Crichton fails to see that the processes that formed the current paradigms in medicine and geology (and overturned the old ones) are same processes that have formed the consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>. The consensus used to be that <A target=""_self"" href=""https://skepticalscience.com/Are-humans-too-insignificant-to-affect-global-<mark>climate</mark>.htm"">human activity is too insignificant to alter the <mark>climate</mark></A>. Science advances and things change.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Finally, Crichton states that &quot;consensus is only invoked in situations where the science is not solid enough.&quot;  He revisits his idea that science boils down to clear &quot;yes or no&quot; answers by suggesting that it's obviously unnecessary to invoke consensus around something like E = mc<SUP>2</SUP>. According to Crichton, this is apparently real science with a right answer. Again, this is not very analogous to something like <mark>climate</mark> science, but it's also not a valid example in its own right. Einstein originally proposed the idea of mass-energy equivalence largely based on theoretical ground and without strong direct empirical evidence. Support grew around the theory, but if you wanted rock-solid &quot;proof&quot;, you probably would have had to wait almost three decades until the discovery of the positron (the observed conversion of energy into matter and antimatter). While it currently may seem silly to think of there being a consensus around E = mc<SUP>2</SUP>, there was a time when this &quot;fact&quot; needed to build up its own evidence and consensus. And in contrast to <mark>climate</mark> science, this particular case <EM>does </EM>largely boil down to a relatively straight-forward test that can convincingly support or refute the theory. Crichton's broader implication that all of <mark>climate</mark> science needs to be 100 percent &quot;solid&quot; is really a strawman argument: an impossible version of reality that is therefore easy to pull apart. Instead of indicating science that's not solid, the consensus on <mark>climate change</mark> informs us which aspects <U>are</U> solid and which are less so.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><STRONG>On <mark>Climate</mark> Models...</STRONG></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Crichton's only direct critique of <mark>climate</mark> science in the lecture is the &quot;overt reliance that is being placed on models&quot;. This is a version of the common claim that the evidence for global warming is based on computer models. Unfortunately, this claim is not true. <mark>Climate</mark> models are one among many tools and methodologies used in <mark>climate</mark> science. They are extremely useful for certain applications (especially in predicting future <mark>climate</mark>), but the conclusion that <A target=""_self"" href=""https://skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-<mark>co2</mark>-enhanced-greenhouse-effect.htm"">humans are significantly contributing to <mark>climate change</mark> through greenhouse gas emissions</A> would remain robust in the absence of computer models. To hold them up as the keystone of <mark>climate</mark> science is another strawman argument.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Even still, Crichton's critique of <mark>climate</mark> models is off base, starting with his confusion of <A target=""_self"" href=""https://skepticalscience.com/weather-forecasts-vs-<mark>climate</mark>-models-predictions.htm"">weather (which is chaotic) and <mark>climate</mark> (which is not)</A>. Most importantly though, <mark>climate</mark> models do not attempt to &quot;predict the world of 2100,&quot; but instead project different <mark>climate</mark> scenarios based on a range of assumptions of what the world might look like in terms of population, greenhouse gas emissions, land use patterns, etc. Their assumptions, caveats, and uncertainties are openly discussed. In the absence of computer models, we can still make valid probabilistic projections of mean <EM>global</EM> temperatures based on future greenhouse gas concentrations (it will get warmer). However, without <mark>climate</mark> models we cannot have any real sense of regional differences, particularly with regard to precipitation. <mark>Climate</mark> models thus provide a very important means of examining potential local impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>, but they are far from the the keystone of consensus that Crichton implies.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><STRONG>Overall...</STRONG></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Aside from his discussion of consensus and <mark>climate</mark> models, Crichton builds an indirect case against <mark>climate change</mark> science based on guilt by association, although he never convincingly demonstrates association, nor guilt. It is a tremendous logical leap of faith to conclude that the search for extraterrestrial radio signals and one group of scientists' research on the potential impacts of nuclear war somehow invalidate decades of <mark>climate</mark> research by thousands of individuals. Overall, Crichton's lecture is primarily supported by his rhetorical skills, not his arguments.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Another take on Crichton's speech with more examination of some of the facts he presents can be found <A target=""\"" href=""http://www.reasic.org/2009/08/michael-crichton-%e2%80%9caliens-cause-global-warming%e2%80%9d/"">here</A>.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><P class=""footnote padding"">Other presentations by Alden Griffith can be found at <A href=""http://www.fool-me-once.com"">Fool Me Once</A>.</P></DIV><P class=""ratingthumbs"" onmouseover=""showtrail( 'Please log in to rate blog posts or comments.', 200, 200 )"" onmouseout=""hidetrail();""><SPAN style=""color:#00a40c"" id=""like0"">0</SPAN></P></BODY></HTML>"

				Posted on <A href=""https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/<mark>michelin</mark>-tires-as-a-service/"" rel=""bookmark"">November 17, 2016</A></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""submission__excerpt entry-summary""><P><mark>Michelin</mark>'s journey from selling tires to selling outcomes.</P></DIV></HEADER><DIV class=""submission__content entry-content""><P><mark>Michelin</mark> is one of the three largest manufacturers of the tires worldwide [1]. The company manufactures tires for a wide variety of vehicles from space shuttles to bicycles. <mark>Michelin</mark> has a history of operating with an innovative mindset in order to stay resilient and relevant in an intensely competitive marketplace. It is credited with transforming the industry through inventions such as the first radial tires as well as the publication of the <mark>Michelin</mark> Guide to encourage people to drive, thereby increasing the demand for tires [2].</P><P>In 2000, <mark>Michelin</mark> made a giant leap by expanding its remit from solely being a manufacturer of tires to becoming a service provider through the launch of the <mark>Michelin</mark> Fleet Solutions (MFS) [3]. <mark>Michelin</mark>’s tires were traditionally priced at a premium and the idea was to create a value-added service for large vehicles fleet operators. Instead of a traditional model, where the customer bore the upfront cost of the tire as well as the entire risk associated with its replacement in case of damage, MFS shared this risk with the consumer for a nominal monthly fee. The project was unsuccessful due to the company’s failure to communicate the value proposition of the added service (better maintained tires last longer), and its inability to align internal incentives. For instance, the sales team felt that by selling MFS, they would be undermining their primary KPI of new tire sales. Moreover, the company struggled to manage the complexity of the cost structure associated with the provision of this service.</P><P>Despite the setback, the senior management was convinced that the future lay in harnessing the power of information systems. In 2013, they created a separate division –<EM><mark>Michelin</mark> Solutions –</EM> in order to design, develop and market services for commercial vehicles, particularly trucks. By leveraging IoT, they launched EFFIFUEL – an ecosystem that uses sensors inside vehicles to collect data, like fuel consumption, tire pressure, temperature, speed, and location [4]. This data is then processed in a cloud solution and analysed by <mark>Michelin</mark> experts, who provide recommendations and training in eco-driving techniques [5].</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Superior Technology</STRONG></P><P>EFFIFUEL is a comprehensive ecosystem that includes sophisticated telematics, training in eco-driving techniques and the EFFITIRES optimized tyre management system.</P><P><STRONG>Confident Customer Promise</STRONG></P><P>EFFIFUEL™ provides a “satisfaction or your money back guarantee” by providing the fuel efficiency service risk-free to truckers, and refunding them if the pre-defined targets for savings are not met.</P><P><STRONG>Strong Results</STRONG></P><P>By encouraging careful handling of the truck equipment, the company has unlocked significant savings for their customers: a reduction in fuel consumption of 2.5 litres per 100km represents annual savings of €3,200 for long-haul transport travelling over 120,000 km (at least 2.1% reduction in total cost of ownership and 8 tonnes in <mark>CO2</mark> emissions) [6].</P><P><mark>Michelin</mark> has learned its lesson from MFS and now works with specialist partners, particularly in the field of big data analytics. Success factors have been an emphasis on cultural change, convincing sceptical employees about the benefits of the new business model, and having an iterative approach built around pilots within the standalone entity of <mark>Michelin</mark> Solutions [7].</P><P>In doing so, they have migrated from being a company that sells tires-as-a-product to a service that guarantees performance, which has led to higher customer satisfaction, loyalty and retention and raised profits [8].</P><P>By embracing technology-led products, they are also bedding a culture of digitization operationally with production techniques increasingly using robotics, 3D printing and augmented reality to create the plant of the future. By demonstrating success in an incubator, the company has managed to create a more open-minded attitude in the workforce.  Furthermore, <mark>Michelin</mark> is now building more internal capability through acquiring third-parties such as Sascar [9], a Brazilian digital fleet management company with expertise in telematics.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>The future</STRONG></P><P><mark>Michelin</mark> is in a position to take advantage of their head-start by building on the ‘as-a-service’ [10] offering model to capture the larger space of drive management. In order to sustain their success, <mark>Michelin</mark> could unlock further spaces:</P><UL><LI><EM>The low-cost emerging economy: </EM>the hotbed for growth is China and India, traditionally dominated by low-cost suppliers. There’s an opportunity to build accessible and affordable solutions that can operate in more complex road conditions. They need to act fast and build a flexible operating model for monitoring systems and local knowledgebase required to win there.</LI></UL><UL><LI><EM>Uberization of tires: </EM>Due to direct access to consumer data and internal data mining capability, they could launch an on-demand tire service using predictable modeling.</LI></UL><UL><LI><EM>Autonomous vehicles:</EM> momentum is building for self-driving vehicles. In order to get a slice of this market, <mark>Michelin</mark> will need to showcase the strength of its offering to become the partner of choice within driving sensors. This may require their organizational borders to be more translucent so they will need to rethink how they protect the IP of their processes.</LI></UL><P> </P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The vast majority of the world's <mark>climate</mark> scientists — estimated at 97 percent by NASA — agree that <mark>climate change</mark> is real, immediate, and largely caused by human activity.  </P><P>According to the National Academy of Sciences, our <mark>climate</mark> is already warming, and continuing the current emissions path will heat our planet by 4 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century. The overwhelming scientific consensus warns of a barrage of tragedies, from reduced food and water supply, extreme weather events, increases in disease, and other disasters as the delicate balance of planet Earth is forever altered. While Citibank recently estimated the cost of <mark>climate change</mark> to be more than $40 trillion, more important is the key operative word — <EM>forever</EM>.  We likely will never be able to return our Earth to the way it is today.    </P><DIV id=""dfp-ad-mosad_1-wrapper"" class=""dfp-tag-wrapper wrapper""><DIV id=""dfp-ad-mosad_1"" class=""dfp-tag-wrapper""><SPAN>ADVERTISEMENT</SPAN></DIV></DIV>The risk management equation is both straightforward and compelling. To put this in the context of running a large company, if 97 percent of experts warned that unless certain steps were taken there would be a significant risk of large explosions at a company's manufacturing facilities, the CEO would be compelled to act on the warning. If the strategy were to merely hope that the experts were wrong and the explosions occurred, the chief executive would lose his job and might, depending on the details, face dire legal consequences. <P><mark>Climate change</mark> is no different. If we do not act now and the science proves even largely right, we will have lost the opportunity to manage our risk. Doing nothing or very little means betting that most of the world's scientists are fundamentally wrong. It is an all or nothing bet with the only planet we have, a bet no sensible person would make. We hope that the scientific community is just plain wrong, but hope is not a strategy. The only rational response is to manage the risk. </P><P>Many companies have come out in support of serious action to fight <mark>climate change</mark> – including Goldman Sachs, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Apple, Google, and Wal-Mart. Three-hundred and sixty-five companies have signed a letter supporting the EPA’s Clean Power Plan regulations. Perhaps most telling, six major oil companies, including Shell and BP, have come forward and acknowledged <mark>climate change</mark>’s likely reality and human cause, and have urged the adoption of a price on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. We, as tire companies, do the same. </P><P>While our companies are each making significant strides in reducing our own <mark>carbon</mark> footprints and will continue to drive improvements, there must be a far greater coordinated regulatory framework and investments in green technologies if the risk is to be effectively managed. Although we are comparatively large companies, compared to the whole picture, we are too small to move the needle.  </P><P>The agreements made during the recent Paris <mark>climate change</mark> talks are a laudable step. The United States sent a strong signal by establishing ambitious but achievable emission reduction targets and demonstrating leadership in Paris. We urge that the United States now not only hold fast to its commitments, but also use its economic might to drive strengthened commitments over time and follow through from other countries around the globe, by implementing a transparent reporting framework to ensure nations live up to their commitments. Moreover, the United States should adopt appropriate policies and regulations, including establishing a <mark>carbon</mark> pricing mechanism, to create a level playing field and invest in the development of scalable clean energies for tomorrow.     </P><P>If the science proves right, and we do not act, how do we possibly explain our current strategy of hopeful denial to at-risk future generations? Conversely, if the United States, as one of the world’s leading and most ingenious countries, unleashes its full potential — as it has to overcome other great challenges in the past — it has the opportunity to produce enormous long-term technological and economic advantages. More importantly, it just might be the driving force needed to avoid the vast economic, social and human damage of <mark>climate change</mark> predicted by the world’s experts.

First, the company was facing competition from low cost competitors. Second, <mark>Michelin</mark> felt it had superior technology in its products but was struggling to capture value from it. And third, <mark>climate change</mark> regulation was slowly encroaching on <mark>Michelin</mark>’s core business. Something needed to happen. </P><P><mark>Michelin</mark> essentially re-architected its business model to give haulage companies its tires away for free. The organization would provide a suite of services and start charging its customers by the kilometre (chips inside the tires would monitor distance and maintenance needs). This change to the business model transformed the customer relationship from being transactional into one focused on long-term contracts. The move also solved some big pain points for haulage companies with increased fuel efficiency (lower costs), better profitability, and ultimately less <mark>carbon</mark> emissions to harm the environment. </P><P><mark>Michelin</mark> effectively solved a double conflict of interest by giving tires out for free and taking responsibility for their disposal. First with customers by being incentivized to sell as few tires as possible. Then with the planet by ultimately manufacturing less and recycling better.</P><P>The traditional approach on environmental or social sustainability in large companies has typically been to respond with a big cheque (philanthropy), a nice ad (public relations), or a team of lobbyists (to influence regulation). We believe sustainability can mean business, too. By turning it into a creative constraint and taking an entire business model perspective, there is an opportunity to generate superior value for the organization, for the customer, and for the planet.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Old Faithful now boasts a porous, clean flexible walkway made mostly of recycled <mark>Michelin</mark> tires. </SPAN></P><P>The pavement surface, known as Flexi-Pave and manufactured by the company K.B. Industries (KBI), is gentler to the environment than asphalt because the permeable composite material allows for better erosion control and preservation of the natural patterns of groundwater flow. In addition, the walkway surface is extremely durable and tolerant of heat and cold, and does not leach any oil into the surrounding environment.</P><P>“The material used to create KBI’s Flexi-Pave is completely benign and therefore can be used safely with the delicate aquifers here in Yellowstone,” said Kevin Bagnall, CEO and founder of KBI, in a statement. The Old Faithful Walkway Project covers 6,400 square feet and includes 900 <mark>Michelin</mark> tires. “The path allows 3,000 gallons of groundwater to pass per square foot. It also is designed to diffuse the water’s force, helping prevent erosion,” Bagnall noted.</P><P>“The Old Faithful Walkway Project is a great example of what a difference a company devoted to sustainability can make in the world’s first national park,” said Karen Bates Kress, president of the Yellowstone Park Foundation, in a statement. “We are fortunate to have a corporate partner as farsighted, public-spirited and generous as <mark>Michelin</mark>,” she added. In fact, <mark>Michelin</mark> flew in a team of employees from across the country to help complete the construction of the walkway. The 10 volunteers were winners of a company-wide contest to participate in the project.</P><P><mark>Michelin</mark> serves as a major corporate sponsor of the Yellowstone Park Foundation, with a goal of helping the park curb operating expenses and reduce the consumption of raw materials. To that end, <mark>Michelin</mark> regularly donates and helps maintain thousands of tires for Yellowstone National Park’s more than 800 vehicles, including patrol cars, garbage trucks, snow plows and load-hauling tractor trailers. The tires feature the latest in green tire technology to help save fuel and reduce emissions.</P><P>“Helping build and provide material for this new pathway is very much in line with <mark>Michelin</mark>’s goal of working with the Yellowstone Park Foundation,” said Leesa Owens, director of community relations for <mark>Michelin</mark>, in a statement.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Traditionally all season tyres start life as a winter tyre, and have the balance of performance moved slightly towards dry and wet running. While this leaves traditional all season tyres excellent on snow and ice, other performance qualities suffer, most notably dry braking.</P><P>The Cross<mark>Climate</mark> started life as a summer tyre, and was gifted winter abilities. While this means it isn't quite as good as traditional all season tyres in extreme winter conditions, it is still more than enough for anything the UK winter has to offer, all while retaining the dry and wet performance of a dedicated summer tyre.</P><P>So, with the multiple award winning Cross<mark>Climate</mark> being updated, what does the new tyre bring? Visually, the only change for the Cross<mark>Climate</mark>+ is the addition of the + on the sidewall, so we've spoken to <mark>Michelin</mark> UK to find out exactly what's new on the inside!</P><H2>The New <mark>Michelin</mark> Cross<mark>Climate</mark>+</H2><P><STRONG>What is the main change in the new Cross<mark>Climate</mark>+?</STRONG></P><P>The main change is the new latest/greatest tread compound. Thanks to the new compound, the Cross<mark>Climate</mark>+ delivers more mileage, so even bigger gap now to All Season competitors, and <mark>Michelin</mark>'s other summer range. It's a new version of the same compound family, and this version works well in multiple geographic zones.</P><P><STRONG>What else has changed?</STRONG></P><P>We have significantly reduced drop off new to worn, meaning the tyre retains its dry, wet and snow performance throughout the treadlife.</P><P><STRONG>Are there any drawbacks to the new Cross<mark>Climate</mark>+?</STRONG></P><P>While dry braking performance is identical to the Cross<mark>Climate</mark>, wet braking has gone from lower part of A of the EU label, over the boundary to upper part of B, hence change looks greater than it is.</P><P>It is only a slight drop in wet braking performance in certain sizes, but we've a large gain in other areas. It's still amongst the top end of the summer ranges as a 'B', only about a third of premium summer tyres offer 'A', and I think considering all the other benefits the Cross<mark>Climate</mark>+ brings, it's worth it.</P><H2>The Cross<mark>Climate</mark> Family</H2><P>The new Cross<mark>Climate</mark>+ will slowly replace the Cross<mark>Climate</mark> in all but 14&quot; sizes. The Cross<mark>Climate</mark> SUV will remain on the market, with additional 19&quot; and 20&quot; sizes due at the start of 2018!</P><P>Still not convinced the Cross<mark>Climate</mark> is the right tyre for you? </P><DIV>Further questions?

The project incorporates extensive social and environmental objectives and safeguards. Planted areas will serve as a buffer zone to protect a threatened national park from encroachment. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>A multi-tranche Sustainability Bond arranged by BNP Paribas (BNPP) and issued by TLFF I Pte Ltd. will fund PT Royal Lestari Utama (RLU), an Indonesian joint venture between France’s <mark>Michelin</mark> and Indonesia’s Barito Pacific Group, for <mark>climate</mark> smart, wildlife friendly, socially inclusive production of natural rubber in Jambi, Sumatra and East Kalimantan provinces. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>The project involves collaboration with WWF, which has worked with <mark>Michelin</mark> and RLU to set aside remaining High <mark>Carbon</mark> Stock (HCS) and High <mark>Carbon</mark> Value (HCV) forest in the RLU concessions, as well as critical wildlife conservation and riparian areas. Out of a concession area of 88,000 hectares, roughly 45,000 hectares will be set aside for community livelihoods and conservation. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>In Jambi Province, the two concession areas held by RLU and two WWF concessions form a contiguous buffer zone protecting the Bukit Tigapuluh National Park, which is one of the last places in Indonesia where elephants, tigers and orangutans co-exist. At maturity, the natural rubber plantation is expected to provide approximately 16,000 fair-wage jobs, providing a critical source of employment for local communities. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>Welcoming the announcement, H.E. Siti Nurbaya Bakar, Hon'ble Minister of Environment and Forestry, Republic of Indonesia, said, &quot;We highly support this positive drive from the private sector using an investment structure like the TLFF, which not only boosts economic development, but also improves much needed skills in the longer term.&quot; </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>“We are honored to take this important step alongside TLFF towards establishing an impactful partnership for the development of a more <mark>sustainable</mark> rubber industry,” said David Sulaiman, President Director of RLU. “This demonstrates our commitment to a thriving, <mark>sustainable</mark> rubber market for the country and our unwavering support for local communities.” </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>Dr. Kuntoro Mangkusbroto, Chairperson of the TLFF welcomed the project’s alignment to achieving the <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals through a holistic triple bottom-line approach that puts people and planet at the heart of all TLFF projects. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>An initial 18,100 hectares of rubber were planted as of December 2017 and the TLFF bond issue will contribute to financing further development of the plantation. USAID has provided a partial credit guarantee on the transaction. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>“It is the role of banks today to make sure we can enable <mark>sustainable</mark> and impactful projects everywhere. While not without its own challenges, this transaction is proof that financial institutions can generate socially beneficial outcomes when we really work hard” said Eric Raynaud, CEO, Asia Pacific and Member of Group Executive Committee at BNP Paribas. “This complex structuring arrangement also demonstrates that our institutional investor clients have the appetite to invest in projects and companies that combine commercial and financial performance with clear environmental and social purpose and impact.” Luc Cardyn, President Director of PT Bank BNP Paribas Indonesia, added “As the Lead Manager on this groundbreaking <mark>Sustainable</mark> Bond transaction, BNP Paribas is proud to help generate economic, environmental and social benefits for Indonesia.” </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>Erik Solheim, Head of UN Environment said </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>“today marks a decisive moment on our way towards <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture and forestry, two key <mark>climate change</mark> solutions. We have seen swift progress since the signing of an agreement between UN Environment and BNP Paribas to target innovative <mark>sustainable</mark> finance of US$ 10 billion by 2025. With this first deal I am confident we are setting an example how the the private sector can play its crucial role.”</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>ADM Capital co-founder and partner, Chris Botsford said, “reversing the current adverse trends on deforestation and <mark>climate change</mark> will take many billions of dollars. Private sector capital must be an essential part of the solution. We hope this transaction will inspire many others to step forward urgently.” </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>“We are delighted to be involved in this exciting and innovative funding approach” said Tony Simons, Director General of the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF). Simons noted “A new paradigm is emerging here with high value investments that seeks to contribute substantial environmental and social dividends alongside risk shared financial returns”. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>This transaction is the first corporate sustainability bond in Asia and the first sustainability bond in ASEAN.

</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></HEADER><DIV class=""content__article-body from-content-api js-article__body"" itemprop=""articleBody"" data-test-id=""article-review-body""><P>Mainstream media coverage has a tendency towards turning every debate into a boxing match. Science and common sense notwithstanding, well-informed professors are often pitted against do-it-yourself media moguls in a battle for the penultimate say over the reader's opinions and perceptions. Readers and society are artificially forced to choose between polar opposites, at the risk of never becoming aware of the most effective choice.</P><P>The <mark>climate change</mark> debate is depicted by the media as follows: on the one side are the <mark>climate</mark> skeptics, complacent oil bigwigs and electoral profit-prompted politicians. On the other side are the alarmists, the dreamers and the crypto-anarchists who want to subvert capitalism. A large crowd of spectators, who are undecided as to who they support, are left out of the debate as they watch from the sidelines. After all, who wants to hear nuanced voices when you can have diametrically opposed opinions? That said, who wants to cover <mark>climate change</mark> when you can obtain much higher ratings by covering stories of daily grief? In short, mainstream media coverage presents the extremes as the default middle ground to readers.</P><P>Though former energy secretary Bill Richardson advocated &quot;<A href=""http://www.triplepundit.com/2012/01/bill-richardson-arab-spring-environment/"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">an Arab Spring for the environment</A>&quot;, the streets remain empty. And when scientific magazines are jammed full of reports on dwindling resources and subsequent <mark>climate</mark> instability, political action continues to be at odds with those signals. As <A href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/164497/capitalism-vs-<mark>climate</mark>?page=full"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Naomi Klein suggests</A>, the <mark>climate</mark> movement needs to have one hell of a comeback. For this comeback to take place, new public awareness, passion and commitment has to emerge.</P><P>The single biggest flaw in our globalised economy is that there is no disincentive for tapping resources and mining raw materials in ways that damage the environment. No one, neither companies nor consumers, accounts for external costs. To remedy this vexing challenge wrought with disastrous consequences, many scholars have argued that green <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Pigovian taxes</A>, should be imposed. They champion a pro-active government that curbs the negative side effects of our economy.</P><P>We must move beyond these pre-configured media-imposed archetypes, though. This decade we are put to a choice. Either we continue to rely on politically unstable but resource-abundant second- and third-world regimes and proceed to follow the dead-end road of a linear material-intensive economy, or we embrace a circular model where external costs are accounted for and acted upon, in order to get in pole position for a <mark>sustainable</mark> future.</P><P>What if we could find a magic middle? What if we could restructure markets to serve everyone's interest? What if we could shatter the fabled <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Gordian Knot</A> that we are put to an 'either/or' debate. What if we could find a profitable business model that buoys a green, socially just and dematerialised economy?</P><H2>The way forward</H2><P>Business must at least pay attention to natural cycles and has to be sensitive to the ecological limits of the planet. Some have suggested that we should focus on imitating the ever-renewable loops of nature – biomimicry or cradle-to-cradle models. These models put a responsibility on the designer to create products that are reusable or naturally decomposable at the end of their lifespan. But as long as the majority of consumers steadfastly vote for <mark>sustainable</mark> products with their minds but purchase conventional products with their wallets, such well-intended and well-thought-through models will not have an impact commensurate with their lofty aspirations. Survey upon consumer survey clearly shows that for now the economic rationale for companies to invest significant amounts of capital to produce <mark>sustainable</mark> products that they can sell and then walk away from is lacking.</P><P>We propose an alternative model. One that incentivises manufacturers to maintain responsibility for their wares through the end of their useful lives, in order to gain access to mass amounts of materials they can use in place of virgin materials. A leasing society model prompts manufacturers to design <mark>sustainable</mark> products not through force or regulations, but through economic incentives. When consumers lease instead of purchase, companies will need to consider not only what happens the moment a product is sold, but also what happens when it comes back in. The realisation descends that, from now on, they have the economic interest to make their products more durable and more <mark>sustainable</mark>, because their expenses will be minimised when the product lasts for its entire leasing period. The replacement of a product will be entirely on the producer's account. Companies thus will benefit from investing in ways to extend their products' lifespans and be de-incentivised to launch — say — a new tablet computer every few months. Therefore a company could outpace its competitors primarily by developing a range of durable devices that could be exploited by receiving monthly fees during their whole leasing periods.</P><H2>Where it already works</H2><P>The analogy can be drawn to other sectors where such a leasing model is already in place. Clearly the strongest evidence to attest this claim is to be found in practice. Consider <mark>Michelin</mark>, the world-leading tyre manufacturer, which now offers durable and rentable tyres; the Dutch telephone company KPN, leases phones to take back and recycle valuable materials, or the flourishing chemicals and carpets leasing markets, developed by Ray Andersen via Interface. Successful precedents for leasing have been set in both the commercial and consumer markets, with fungible economic and environmental benefits. It is time to nurture this alternative economic consumption model for a far broader range of products. Not for moral reasons, but for reasons of shared prosperity.</P><P>This is not to present leasing as an all-encompassing panacea, but it does put us on the track of a circular, self-supporting economy. We must embrace this alternative. For economic development., for environmental stewardship, and for an increased likelihood the planet will be able to support a rapidly growing population. Consumption without conviction, without conscience and without recycling will not enable shared prosperity that is also scalable.</P><P>The allure of the leasing society model is that it does not put aside capitalism. Rather, it fully employs the superb allocation mechanism of the market to account for private benefits and public costs. It recalibrates the meaning of economy to be convergent with durability and with resource efficiency – eg the most durable and resource-efficient product will be the most economical product. The producers that make unwavering commitments to ensuring this recalibration will be the ones that will experience competitive advantage as a result. And that is exactly what we want: a world where the dimensions of commerce, resource efficiency, durability, sustainability, economy and competitive advantage converge to usher in a new era of prosperity for shareholders and stakeholders alike.</P><P><EM><SPAN class=""bullet"">•</SPAN> Judith Merkies MEP is a member of the European Parliament Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.</EM></P><P><EM><SPAN class=""bullet"">•</SPAN> Eric Lowitt is author of </EM><A href=""http://www.ericlowitt.com/book/"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""><EM>The Future of Value</EM></A></P><P><STRONG>This content is brought to you by </STRONG><A href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional"" title=""Guardian Professional"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""><STRONG>Guardian Professional</STRONG></A><STRONG>.

It’s still early, a work in progress, but<A href=""http://time.com/4391096/rubber-deforestation/""> environmental groups</A> are praising <mark>Michelin</mark>. Higonnet says <mark>Michelin</mark>’s shift in tone is huge.</P><P>“I think it’s a game changer. Now that <mark>Michelin</mark> has opened the door, other companies will feel some pressure to walk through and join on that path of sustainability, if only because there is growing scrutiny.”</P><P>Other tire companies may well follow <mark>Michelin</mark>’s lead.</P><P>“It may be that they’re worried about reputational risk or alternatively hoping that really committing to sustainability will give them an advantage with consumers,” says Harvard business school professor <A href=""http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=12345"">Rebecca Henderson</A>.</P><P>That has certainly played out in other industries.

ENGIE joins <mark>Michelin</mark> in investing in Symbio FCell to accelerate the development of hydrogen mobility solutions</H1></DIV><DIV class=""teq-visionneuse-html""><DIV class=""zone-editable""><P> </P><P><B><I>Symbio FCell, a pioneering company in fuel cell technology and inventors of the first range extender for hybrid (combined electricity and hydrogen) vehicles, has conducted a new round of fundraising and brought ENGIE into the ranks of its investors.</I></B></P><P>The funds raised give Symbio FCell the means to develop faster, particularly in the field of hydrogen mobility. “<I>ENGIE’s arrival alongside <mark>Michelin</mark> sends a strong signal to businesses and governments that have chosen to become players in the energy transition and want to get access to solutions that can be rapidly operationalized</I>” says Fabio Ferrari, CEO of Symbio FCell.</P><P>ENGIE, as a player in the green mobility market, has taken steps to speed up the development of alternative energies, including in electric transportation. Having installed more than 5,000 charging stations in Europe, the Group is now helping to encourage the use of hydrogen in electric mobility. By joining <mark>Michelin</mark> in investing in Symbio FCell, ENGIE will take an active part in the evolution of hydrogen uses and already experiments the installation of H2 infrastructures.</P><P>“<I>This project perfectly illustrates the Group’s commitment to developing hydrogen-powered transportation by teaming up with industry partners. ENGIE wants to develop green mobility and especially alternative green energies, deploying NGV as an alternative fuel, or electric mobility, with EV charging stations being installed in Europe, or innovative solutions dealing with hydrogen</I>” says Thierry Lepercq, Executive Vice-President at ENGIE.</P><P>For its part, <mark>Michelin</mark> reaffirmed its confidence in Symbio FCell by participating in the second round of funding, thereby becoming the company’s main shareholder. This investment shows that <mark>Michelin</mark> expects to reap the benefits of diving directly into an external ecosystem as a way of supporting <mark>innovation</mark>. And the way is has chosen to do is revelatory: working with successful entrepreneurs and getting its internal incubation program (IPO) involved in the field of <mark>sustainable</mark> mobility for people and goods.</P><P>“<I><mark>Michelin</mark> is a player in the field of <mark>sustainable</mark> mobility and considers hydrogen to be one key component of this domain. Symbio FCell’s approach kick-starts profitable hydrogen mobility services that meet urban needs, prior to the massive arrival of mainstream H2 vehicles</I>” notes Laurent Noual, member of the Executive Committee of the <mark>Michelin</mark> Group.</P><P>Transportation is responsible for 23% of <mark>CO2</mark> emissions in the world, and the sector is still 95% reliant on oil-based fuels. The transition to cleaner and more <mark>sustainable</mark> forms of mobility is therefore essential, especially in cities, where three of four people in the world will live by 2050. Hydrogen is an alternative energy that will help to greatly reduce <mark>CO2</mark> emissions in the sector while also improving air quality, especially in urban centers.</P><P>  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

French chef Joël Robuchon? He’s got 31 of them—more than any other chef in the world. The culinary maestro, now 72, first garnered international acclaim back in 1981 with the opening of his first space in Paris, Jamin, which was, at the time, considered one of the finest restaurants in the world. In the years since, he’s set up shop in a dozen major cities across the globe, including Monaco, Shanghai, Tokyo, and London. This season, New Yorkers can experience firsthand the <mark>Michelin</mark> master’s cuisine at the just-opened L’ATELIER de Joël Robuchon.</P><P data-reactid=""236"">This latest imprint of L’Atelier marks chef Robuchon’s return to the city after five years away (his Four Seasons L’Atelier closed in 2012). When asked why, despite having restaurants in cities across the world, he felt it important to have a space in Manhattan, he replied, “New York is the capital of the world.”</P><P data-reactid=""237"">L’Atelier New York, Robuchon says, “has the L’Atelier DNA but has kept the look and feel of downtown New York City.” To help the space—located in the former Colicchio &amp; Sons building in the Meatpacking District—maintain that downtown industrial look, the chef enlisted French architect Pierre-Yves Rochon, whose design calls attention to the building’s oversize windows and incorporates exposed brick walls and steel columns.</P><FIGURE class=""embedded-image"" data-id=""5a0cabbf7cca8b4525f6da47"" data-caption=""&lt;p&gt;Joël Robuchon, the French chef who has earned 28 <mark>Michelin</mark> stars—the most of any chef in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

Together with his team—that includes Executive Chef Christophe Bellanca, Executive Pastry Chef Salvatore Martone, and Head Baker Tetsuya Yamaguchi—Robuchon is working to make the New York L’Atelier every bit as reputable as its sister restaurants. After all, says the chef, “consistency is one of the hallmarks of earning and maintaining <mark>Michelin</mark> stars.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""article-after-content"" data-reactid=""250""><DIV class=""component-tags"" data-reactid=""251""><H2 class=""tags-title"" data-reactid=""252"">Explore</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
