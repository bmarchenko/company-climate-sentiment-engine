In 2009, while the Obama administration <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/18/obama-speech-copenhagen-<mark>climate</mark>-summit"">pledged to</A> “renew our leadership in international <mark>climate</mark> negotiations,” leading Chinese energy experts labeled United Nations-sponsored <mark>climate</mark> talks a “<A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/11/chinese-thinktank-copenhagen-document"">conspiracy by developed nations</A>” to undermine its development. </P><P>But in the intervening years, Beijing and Washington have undergone a complete role reversal. In recent weeks, China has made clear its leaders are willing to let environmental considerations drive its economic development policy, rather than the other way around. Despite being the world’s <A href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/tychodefeijter/2016/05/16/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-chinese-car-market/#487164693025"">largest car market</A>, China has announced its intention to <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/business/china-hastens-the-world-toward-an-electric-car-future.html"">phase out non-electric vehicles</A>, and to <A href=""http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2113650/new-environment-tax-will-hit-businesses-china-hard-say"">impose crushing taxes</A> on polluting companies despite <A href=""https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG"">slowing growth</A>.</P><DIV id=""dfp-ad-mosad_1-wrapper"" class=""dfp-tag-wrapper wrapper""><DIV id=""dfp-ad-mosad_1"" class=""dfp-tag-wrapper""><SPAN>ADVERTISEMENT</SPAN></DIV></DIV>During the same period, the U.S. has pledged to <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-<mark>climate</mark>-usa-paris/u-s-submits-formal-notice-of-withdrawal-from-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-pact-idUSKBN1AK2FM"">withdraw from the Paris Agreement</A> on <mark>climate change</mark> and to <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/<mark>climate</mark>/clean-power-plan.html"">repeal the Clean Power Plan</A>, its primary tool to combat global warming, citing a need to <A href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/01/statement-president-trump-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-accord"">boost economic growth</A>. Why has the &quot;green divide&quot; between U.S. and China grown so wide — and, more importantly, who’s on the right side?<P> </P><P>In fairness, neither country has consistently put the planet ahead of its own prosperity. The U.S. <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bush-administration-pushes-<mark>climate</mark>-change-action-into-future/"">slow-rolled global <mark>climate</mark> talks</A> until about a decade ago, and China continues to rate poorly on <A href=""http://archive.epi.yale.edu/epi/country-profile/china"">most measures of environmental protection</A>. But make no mistake — the U.S. and Chinese governments' diametrically opposed approaches to energy and the environment represent very different bets on what will drive peace and prosperity in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century. One country will be proved right, and the other wrong. </P><P>For the Trump administration, the bet is clear: a less globalized world will favor energy security built on fossil fuels.</P><P>Beijing’s vision is more complex, and longer-term. It sees a more interconnected world where environmental sustainability is crucial to maintaining political support, global stability and economic growth.</P><P>The stakes of these opposite bets couldn’t be higher.</P><P>Up to <A href=""https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2014/june/world-needs-48-trillion-in-investment-to-meet-its-energy-needs-to-2035.html"">$48 trillion will be invested in energy infrastructure</A> alone by 2035, making it critical to know whether the future lies more in solar than in coal. Whether the U.S. or Chinese bets pay off depends on three factors.</P><P>The first and most important factor, which Washington and Beijing see very differently, is how much future growth will be powered by clean technologies like renewable energy and electric vehicles.</P><P>China has bet heavily that it will. The country has<A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-renewables-investment-idUSKCN0WQ1IU""> invested over twice as much</A> as the U.S. in renewable energy, betting that rapid global growth will drive continued export sales. The <A href=""https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.414422.de/dp1263.pdf"">value of Chinese solar energy exports</A> increased 26-fold to $32 billion in just five years, and accounted for 3 percent of total export value as early as 2010. Such rapid growth relies heavily on <A href=""https://www.trade.gov/topmarkets/pdf/renewable_energy_top_markets_report.pdf"">government policy support and subsidie</A>s, which likely aren’t <mark>sustainable</mark>. But for now, China’s bet on green-powered growth is paying off handsomely. </P><P>The second factor concerns public opinion on environmental issues. China, which has long feared that <mark>pollution</mark> might <A href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2014-06-10/<mark>pollution</mark>-without-revolution"">stoke mass discontent</A>, has adopted ever-more stringent environmental measures, including <A href=""http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2109342/top-level-china-<mark>pollution</mark>-inspections-wrapping"">making the promotion of local officials contingent</A> on meeting environmental quality standards.</P><P>The Trump administration, meanwhile, has <A href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/01/statement-president-trump-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-accord"">promised to maintain</A> “the highest standard of environmental protection,” but has proposed to do so while <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/05/<mark>climate</mark>/trump-environment-rules-reversed.html"">reducing environmental protection budgets and slashing regulation</A>s. Given the strong public reaction to environmental disasters like the <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/flint-water-crisi"">Flint water crisis</A> and the California wildfires, which have been <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-see-<mark>climate</mark>-change-in-californias-wildfires/"">linked to <mark>climate change</mark></A>, the Trump administration’s long bet on avoiding future eco-crises looks risky. </P><P>But perhaps nowhere is the U.S.-China green divide wider than on the third factor, the extent to which <mark>climate change</mark> and other environmental issues will impact global stability. While Beijing termed <mark>climate change</mark> a “<A href=""https://www.scribd.com/document/350072665/Final-Version-EU-China-Leaders-Joint-Statement-on-<mark>Climate</mark>-Change#from_embed"">root cause of instability</A>” in a joint statement with the European Union this past June, President Trump issued an executive order in March <A href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/28/presidential-executive-order-promoting-energy-independence-and-economi-1"">specifically revoking</A> a landmark Obama administration report warning that <mark>climate change</mark> would further destabilize fragile regions like the Middle East and reduce military readiness.</P><P>This change in direction looks like another risky bet, given that a<A href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3241.short""> widely-cited recent study</A> concluded that <mark>climate change</mark> played a key role in stoking Syria’s civil war, which Trump has cited as one of his most pressing foreign policy concerns. </P><P>So who stands on the right side of the great green divide? In the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century, energy and environmental policy isn’t simply about protecting the planet, but also making the right bets on the future of economic growth, politics and security. For the time being, at least, the deck looks stacked in China’s favor. Indeed, if it continues on its current course, the U.S. might even find itself out of the game. And with the stakes so high, Beijing might just run the table. </P><P><EM>Scott Moore is a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy. </EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The gap in <mark>climate</mark> financing therefore offers considerable opportunities for competitive donors to influence the <mark>climate</mark> agenda and international affairs more generally. In this potential competition, China has many advantages, including empathy for the need for economic development and the necessity of cooperation. This has resulted in China’s “assistance-plus investment” foreign aid model.</P><P>International opinion on China’s foreign aid, however, is extremely polarized. Some argue that China’s no “strings attached” approach is efficient and generates win-win outcomes. Others criticize this direct, economically-driven assistance as a form of neocolonialism.</P><P>Unarguably, China’s influence on less-developed countries has been growing rapidly, along with growing concern from the West. The reasons behind this come not only from concerns that China may undermine the democratic process of these countries but also, and more important, from the fear of losing advantages they earn from their own foreign aid programs.</P><P>The elephant in the room at COP22 was the question, Does Trump fear losing these advantages?

TCX would explore how to use a cap-and-trade system and <mark>carbon</mark> pricing to encourage the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.   It was a joint venture between China National Petroleum Company (CNPC), a subsidiary of PetroChina, the vast state-owned oil company; the City of Tianjin, eager to establish itself as a modern financial hub; and the Chicago <mark>Climate</mark> Exchange (CCX), whose founder was financial innovator and economist Richard L. Sandor, who was eventually awarded the Légion d’honneur by the government of France for his pioneering work in environmental markets.</P><P>Now eight years later, after observing the seven pilot programs and signing on to a bilateral <mark>climate change</mark> initiative with the Obama administration, China is poised to launch a national cap-and-trade system and national “<mark>carbon</mark> market” in either late 2016 or early 2017.  The rules of the national market are being developed, and will draw upon lessons from the pilots, such as which sectors will be covered and whether to auction initial allowances. Overall, the Chinese market will be similar to other commodity markets worldwide and to the European Union’s own <mark>climate change</mark> cap-and-trade program (EU ETS).</P><P>But the Chinese <mark>carbon</mark> market will soon dwarf all the others, and it is likely to set the de facto benchmark price, which all other markets, traders, emitting companies, and financial institutions will have to consider. In turn, China’s <mark>carbon</mark> market could change the foreign policy landscape; establishing a viable global trading system for greenhouse gas emissions will require significant international cooperation, capacity building, transparency, and inter-governmental trust.</P><P>The irony is apparent: the United States invented cap-and-trade </P><DIV class=""paywall-loading""><P class=""load-text"">Loading, please wait...</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""article-newsletter-signup--container-alt""><DIV class=""container"" id=""newsletter-sign-up-message""><DIV class=""l-2up--1""><H3 class=""title"">

On Tuesday, China confirmed that it’s building what will become the biggest market for the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions that stem from burning fossil fuels. The program will force utilities to pay for at least some permits to release <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, encouraging them to invest in equipment that will use fuel more efficiently and reduce <mark>pollution</mark>.</P><H3>1. How significant is China’s <mark>carbon</mark> market?</H3><P>China’s participation in <mark>carbon</mark> trading would boost the portion of emissions covered by pricing worldwide to almost 25 percent. It creates a financial incentive for power companies in China to cut emissions and favor cleaner power generation. <mark>Pollution</mark> is still rising three decades after almost 200 nations led by the U.S. endorsed the United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>climate change</mark>, a treaty to limit fossil-fuel emissions. <mark>Carbon</mark> markets, along with cheaper renewable energy, have started to slow that growth.</P><H3>2. What is the <mark>carbon</mark> market supposed to do in China?</H3><P>The market is supposed to help clean the air and reward companies and executives for switching to cleaner systems. It provides a carrot because companies that can cut emissions quickly can sell spare allowances for profit. On the stick side, companies that fail to comply may be fined or have to pay for more permits to pollute.</P><H3>3. Will this impact <mark>carbon</mark> trading in Europe or the U.S.?</H3><P>Not yet, but it might. China’s push for its own market may embolden authorities in Europe and the parts of the U.S. where <mark>carbon</mark> markets operate to strengthen theirs. More than a decade after <mark>carbon</mark> trading started in Europe, prices remain at less than half of the 20 euros-a-ton level that industry analysts say is needed to spur real change. Having China involved blunts concern that industries will move away from places where <mark>carbon</mark> trading flourishes, since one of the big potential destinations for factories to relocate would now be covered.</P><H3>4. Is China becoming more ambitious on <mark>carbon</mark> trading?</H3><P>China is moving more carefully in erecting its market. A year ago, authorities were considering a nationwide system that would cover 7,000 companies. The program confirmed on Dec. 19 includes only 1,700 companies in the utility industry, and it isn’t clear whether it will extend across the whole of China or just to nine provinces, said Sophie Lu, a researcher at Bloomberg New Energy Finance in Beijing.</P><H3>5. What’s still being worked out?</H3><P>The government has yet to say when trading will start. Traders also will want to know how many of the emissions permits will be handed out for free and how any auctions of allowances will work, whether there will be fines for non-compliance and what the timetable is for bringing more companies under the system. Further out, it will be interesting to see if China moves to link its market with trading in Europe and the Americas.</P><H3>The Reference Shelf</H3><UL><LI><A itemscope=""itemscope"" itemprop=""StoryLink"" href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/view/quicktake/<mark>carbon</mark>-markets-2-0"" title=""<mark>Carbon</mark> Pricing Spreads Along With Debate About Payoff: QuickTake"" target=""_blank"">QuickTake explainer </A>on the spread of <mark>carbon</mark> pricing and the debate about its effectiveness. </LI><LI>The World Bank’s </LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

The move sends a concrete signal to leaders across the globe that China is committed to addressing <mark>climate change</mark> at a moment when the U.S. is stepping back on the issue.</P><P>“The anticipation of this announcement, which has been building for months, is a reflection of how crucial China is,” says Nat Keohane, head of the Global <mark>Climate</mark> program at the Environmental Defense Fund. “This is the Mount Everest of <mark>climate policy</mark>.”</P><P>China first <A href=""http://time.com/4049192/us-china-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">said in 2015</A> that it would create a national <mark>carbon</mark> market ahead of the negotiations that ultimately yielded the <A href=""http://time.com/4146764/paris-agreement-<mark>climate</mark>-cop-21/"">Paris Agreement</A> on <mark>climate change</mark>. That announcement—made by Chinese President Xi Jinping as he stood beside then-President Obama—was a signal that the world’s two largest economies and polluters were unified in their commitment to addressing the issue. <mark>Climate policy</mark> experts say those pledges helped seal the global deal targeting greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>But since then the U.S. has retreated from its leadership role on the the issue under President Trump, who has promised to withdraw the country from the Paris Agreement and sought to undo Obama-era <mark>climate</mark> regulations at every opportunity. On Monday, the White House suggested that global policies aimed at tacking <mark>climate change</mark> were part of an “anti-growth energy agenda” in an unveiling of its <A href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">National Security Strategy</A>. Instead, Trump plans to promote U.S. “<A href=""http://time.com/4839884/energy-dominance-energy-independence-donald-trump/?iid=sr-link2"">energy dominance</A>” with a focus on promoting American fossil fuels.</P><P>That reversal has left China and a handful of countries in Western Europe seeking to <A href=""http://time.com/4810846/china-energy-<mark>climate</mark>-change-paris-agreement/"">fill the gap,</A> and China’s new <mark>carbon</mark> market will play a central role. The nation’s power sector generates nearly 40% of its <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions, and the effort to curb emissions will eventually expand to include the chemicals, building materials and aviation industries, among others. The program creates a financial incentive for natural gas and coal-fired power plants to reduce their emissions by requiring plants to hold permits for those emissions. Plants that exceed the standard can sell their excess permits.</P><P>Along with other policies, the <mark>carbon</mark> market will help China cap its emissions by 2030, with some <A href=""http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/65483/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">estimates</A> suggesting it could do so before 2025. Meeting that goal would allow the country to strengthen its targets in the ongoing United Nations <mark>climate change</mark> negotiations, which <mark>climate policy</mark> experts say would increase the chances that the world hits the targets set in the Paris Agreement.</P><P>Unlike the Trump Administration, Chinese leaders—along with many in Europe—see <mark>climate change</mark> as an <A href=""http://time.com/5022606/china-coal-solar-energy/"">opportunity to drive growth</A>. By sheer virtue of its size, China’s move away from coal will cripple the global industry and help push the world toward cleaner energy sources. When that happens, China is prepared to supply the world with clean energy technology like solar panels and lithium ion batteries that it manufactures domestically thanks to billions in investment from the national government..</P><P>“They’re stepping up to make it clear that they’re not going to wait for the United States,” former Secretary of State John Kerry <A href=""http://time.com/5066682/global-<mark>climate</mark>-change-plan/"">told</A> TIME earlier this year. “There’s no grass growing under the feet of the Chinese.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""bottom-recirc padded-mobile "" data-tracking-zone=""bottom-recirc""><DIV class=""component lead-gen clearfix bottom-recirc"" data-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3365&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABPFT&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-mobile-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3365&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABPFT&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-partial=""sponsored-tile"" data-variation=""bottom-recirc"" data-title=""SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT"" data-provider=""dianomi"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-bottom-recirc"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-right-rail"" data-logo=""http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png"" data-logo_url=""https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&amp;utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank"" data-native_ad=""%7B%22dimensions%22%3A%22482x100%22%2C%22placement%22%3A%22footer%22%2C%22priority%22%3A6%7D"" data-nativekey=""KRVQvVbckcRMP4FTYBYnvWqY""><DIV class=""title-wrapper""><H3 class=""subtitle"">SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

And the problem is only worsening.

Just $5 a month.</A><P>To solve this issue, China must take a great, green leap forward, according to Li Shuo, the senior global policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia. “We need electricity market reform, and we need to apply a more market oriented approach,” he says, before criticizing how the Chinese electricity system favors coal. “In most countries… it depends on operational cost. So once you put turbines, it doesn’t cost anything to generate, because it comes from the wind. But coal will cost you because it needs to burned — so in theory it should be market oriented, and wind and solar will be automatically prioritized.”</P><P>Yet even if renewables become more viable on the market, there will be no guarantee of ecological and economic synergy. Xiamen University professor Lin Boqiang — an energy expert who has offered consultation to oil behemoth PetroChina — <A target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/<mark>climate</mark>/china-<mark>climate</mark>-change-trump-paris-accord.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=2"">recently told the <EM>New York Times</EM></A> that “China is now No. 1 in the world in installed capacity of wind and solar power. This would not be possible without all the talk about <mark>climate change</mark> and a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy.” But because the United States is dropping out of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> pact, Lin tells <EM>The Diplomat </EM>he is concerned about “how that will affect all the industry behavior and countries’ policies around the world. What will happen if they ignore <mark>CO2</mark> emissions?” Lin adds that China’s <mark>carbon</mark> friendly policies would hamper its ability to compete.</P><P>Even without such circumstances coming to pass, leaving nations scurrying from the <mark>climate</mark> commitments, the Paris accord’s initial promise has already been inhibited in Ma’s eyes.</P><P>The activist says the pact’s “full implementation very much relies on bottom-up action by different stakeholders, especially the business community. The impact on their confidence could be quite a problem,” thanks to President Trump’s rejection of the accord. He says this is because the Paris agreement “is different from the <A target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/11/kyoto-protocol"">Kyoto protocol</A>, which was legally binding and top down. The Paris accord is non binding, it’s based more on voluntary commitment.”</P><P>Worrisome as those issues may be, Alvin Lin maintains an outlook as sunny as rays being soaked up by China’s ever growing number of solar panels. He says, “Even as Trump withdraws the United States from the Paris agreement, China and the EU are working to strengthen their cooperation on clean energy and <mark>carbon</mark> pricing, and China is also looking to expand its cooperation with other developing countries on low <mark>carbon</mark> development and expanding renewable energy.”</P><P>He is also heartened by the government’s pledge to reduce wasteful renewable curtailment by five percent before the end of the decade, a threshold that he says China can reach with policy shifts and technical upgrades. Li of Greenpeace East Asia agrees, adding that more interconnectivity between the currently “fragmented” power grids from one province to the next will greatly prevent waste and help China’s renewables finally reach their capacity.</P><P>Lin says other promising signs include China’s commitment to invest $360 billion in renewables in its current five year plan, the country’s target to lower coal consumption to 58 percent before the end of the decade (an unpredicted low in its use of that sooty energy source), its plans to move forward on a <mark>carbon</mark> cap and trade program before 2018, along with its current 3.5 million green energy jobs, the highest of any country around the globe and an “area for growth” in Lin’s eyes.</P><P>Meanwhile, Li’s faith in China as the forerunner in the fight against <mark>climate change</mark> stems not from such stats, but instead a head of state’s speech. To him, Trump’s withdrawal announcement was preempted six months earlier, when President Xi Jinping stepped to the podium at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “He made a speech urging countries to stand with the Paris accord, and it was right before Trump’s inauguration,” Li recalls. “That’s a clear indication that his message was intended for the incoming American administration. It was also a strong reaffirming of the Paris agreement, and China’s resolve to implement relevant requirements.”</P><P>It was a grand and reaffirming gesture in Li’s view, though he sees even greater indications daily on the street in Beijing, as more and more citizens strap on masks on smoggy days, buy air purifiers and quickly gain awareness about the capital’s notorious smog, while also taking to social media and other platforms to voice their concerns. “The public clearly sees the need to take action, to reform our energy system and our over reliance on coal,” he says, adding: “This provides a strong domestic political driver to take continuous action.”</P><P>Alex Wang, an assistant professor of Law at UCLA School of Law focusing on comparative environmental law, strikes a similar chord. “Perhaps the main reason for us to believe that China will take actions that support <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation is that Chinese leaders very much see clean energy, energy efficiency, and reduced <mark>carbon</mark> intensity as squarely in the national interest,” he tells <EM>The Diplomat</EM>. “The country has developed to the ecological brink.”</P><P>However, Wang also believes caution is in order. “[S]uccessful implementation of these goals is not a foregone conclusion… turning this ocean liner around will still take decades.”</P><P><EM>Kyle Mullin is a magazine editor and freelance reporter based in Beijing. </EM></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""postInfoWrapper""><DIV class=""postInfo postInfoTopics""><DIV class=""postInfoItem postLabel""><SPAN>Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

And they're just the leaders to do it, per the terms of what President Barack Obama called a &quot;<A href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/11/us-china-joint-announcement-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">historic agreement</A>&quot; announced November 12 between the U.S. and China. Although neither country has <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-win-the-war-on-coal-<mark>carbon</mark>-capture-and-storage/"">plans to stop burning coal</A> or oil in the near future, both countries now have commitments to reduce the greenhouse gases that result. &quot;As the world's two largest economies, energy consumers and emitters of greenhouse gases, we have a special responsibility to lead the global effort against <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; said Obama in a joint press conference with President Xi Jinping, wrapping up a visit to Beijing that included the <A href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/11/us-china-joint-announcement-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">joint effort on <mark>climate change</mark></A>. 
The U.S. will <A href=""http://m.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/11/fact-sheet-us-china-joint-announcement-<mark>climate</mark>-change-and-clean-energy-c"">double the speed</A> of its current <mark>pollution</mark> reduction trajectory, which has seen <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions fall roughly 10 percent below 2005 levels to date. The country will now aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. That's in addition to the 17 percent reduction below 2005 levels due by 2020 and shows the kind of five-year planning the U.S. would like to see adopted in international plans to combat <mark>climate change</mark>. In other words, ever-increasing ambition in reduction targets delivered every five years. &quot;This is an ambitious goal, but it is an achievable goal,&quot; Obama said. &quot;It puts us on a path to achieving the deep emissions reductions by advanced economies that the scientific community says is necessary to prevent the most catastrophic effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.&quot; 
Although Chinese leaders are quite fond of five-year plans, their new <mark>climate</mark> version would not begin until &quot;around 2030,&quot; under the terms of the new agreement. That is when the country's <mark>CO2</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> will peak, advancing the Chinese war on <mark>pollution</mark> onto the invisible front. The nation will also &quot;strive&quot; to reach that peak even sooner. Just as Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli <A href=""http://www.un.org/<mark>climate</mark>change/summit/"">pledged at the United Nations</A> in September &quot;to peak total <mark>CO2</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> as soon as possible,&quot; now Xi has followed through in November with the first agreed-on date to cap its global warming <mark>pollution</mark> by 2030. <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/price-of-coal-in-china-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">The problem is coal</A>, which currently provides more than 70 percent of the energy the fast-developing nation uses. <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/price-of-coal-in-china-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">Hundreds of new coal-burning power plants</A> account for how China surpassed the U.S. in the past decade as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. But already several Chinese cities and provinces are experimenting with the kind of capitalist solutions favored by U.S. free marketeers—<A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/<mark>carbon</mark>-trading-experiments-in-china/"">cap-and-trade programs</A> that in some cases even extend to cover public transportation and buildings themselves. These programs are pilots and may be scaled up for a national program expected in coming years or scrapped in favor of some new national plan or <mark>carbon</mark> tax. &quot;China has plans for a national market and one that is the most ambitious in the world,&quot; says Barbara Finamore, Asia director at the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council and longtime Beijing resident. &quot;It would dwarf any other <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gaming-<mark>carbon</mark>-must-end-to-solve-global-warming/""><mark>carbon</mark> market</A> in the world.&quot; 
More importantly perhaps, the Chinese central government has begun to talk about a cap on coal-burning itself. Statistics show that this year coal use in China slowed for the first time this century, <A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/newsdesk/energy/data/chinas-coal-use-actually-falling-now-first-time-century"">dropping by around 1 percent</A>, according to Greenpeace International. The hopeful sign suggests that peak coal use could come within the next decade or so, although this dip could also be a result of slowing economic growth rather than proactive efforts to slow <mark>climate change</mark>. But peak coal use is exactly what the Chinese have agreed to ensure now, along with cuts in <mark>CO2</mark> intensity by 2020. Already China's National Development and Reform Commission has laid out a plan to cope with <mark>climate change</mark> through the end of the decade. 
That means building even <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-nuclear-power-can-stop-global-warming/"">more nuclear power plants</A>, wind farms, hydroelectric dams and even to start employing more solar power, of which the country installed 12 gigawatts-worth in 2013. In fact, in 2013 more new clean energy sources were added to the grid in China than fossil fuel-fired power—for the first time ever. China has added several hundred gigawatts-worth of such clean energy—the Three Gorges Dam alone pumps out 22 gigawatts— but hopes to add as much as 1,000 gigawatts of these low-<mark>carbon</mark> emitting sources by 2030. That would constitute 20 percent of its energy—and roughly the total amount of all electricity produced in the U.S. or all the coal-fired power plants China has built in the last few decades. It's also double what the Chinese have committed to achieve by 2015 in their current Five-Year Plan. 
China is already the <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/china-goes-nuclear-to-avoid-coal-burning/"">world leader in new nuclear</A> and new renewable energy sources, and the energy intensity of its economy dropped by more than 19 percent between 2006 and 2010. But this week’s commitment will require an acceleration in these <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-global-transition-to-renewable-energy-will-take-many-decades/"">already fast-paced transition</A> efforts. 
At the same time, the U.S. and China will continue to collaborate on developing the kind of <A href=""http://e360.yale.edu/feature/can_<mark>carbon</mark>_capture_technology_be_part_of_the_<mark>climate</mark>_solution/2800/""><mark>CO2</mark> capture and storage</A> (CCS) that could help clean coal-burning for power plants but also industry, such as steel and cement-making. That change will come through increased funding to the <A href=""http://www.us-china-cerc.org/"">U.S.-China Clean Energy Research Center</A>—one of the fruits of the <A href=""https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2009/11/17/more-important-than-copenhagen-u-s-china-deal-on-energy-and-<mark>climate</mark>/"">last deal between the two countries</A> in 2009—and at least one &quot;large-scale pilot project.&quot; This project will not rely on <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/enhanced-oil-recovery/"">flushing more oil out of the ground</A> with the <mark>CO2</mark> to be buried, as U.S. CCS projects have done, but rather serve as a bid to help solve China's water crisis by using <mark>CO2</mark> to produce fresh water from an underground saltwater aquifer. The project is expected to &quot;inject one million tons of <mark>CO2</mark> and create approximately 1.4 million cubic meters of freshwater per year,&quot; a major technological advance if achieved. 
Trade will also play a role: The tariff agreement signed this week by the two countries may also extend to green goods in the future, such as more energy-efficient and resilient building materials. After all, <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/biello-china-house-boom-urban-class-environmentally-responsible/"">how China builds out its cities</A> in the next few decades will lock in either highly polluting energy for decades—or not. 
Already, conventional air <mark>pollution</mark> like smog is driving change in China, including the mandated shutdown of factories and <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/china-driving-to-the-future-of-two-billon-cars/"">driving restrictions</A> around Beijing in recent days in a bid to clear the air for world leaders. &quot;Air <mark>pollution</mark> has become one of the most important issues facing China today, both for social stability and also international reputation,&quot; Finamore notes. &quot;They are beginning to decouple coal use and economic growth.&quot; 
Cleaner air could also come in the form of converting <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-china-s-bid-to-turn-coal-to-gas-be-stopped/"">coal to gas or liquids</A> at giant chemical plants before burning it, which would help reduce smog but exacerbate <mark>CO2</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>. Or it could come in the form of CCS, nuclear and renewables. &quot;There is real potential for shifting of coal use in China from most polluted regions inland, which is why a national cap on coal consumption that's mandatory is so important,&quot; Finamore says, adding that it's a &quot;real possibility.&quot; 
The agreement between the two countries that together emit more than 40 percent of global <mark>CO2</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> suggests a strong deal will be signed by the world's nations in Paris in 2015, under the terms of the <A href=""http://newsroom.unfccc.int/"">United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark></A>, unlike Copenhagen in 2009. Prior to that meeting <A href=""https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2009/11/17/more-important-than-copenhagen-u-s-china-deal-on-energy-and-<mark>climate</mark>/"">China and the U.S. pledged to cooperate</A> but made no firm commitments to reduce <mark>pollution</mark>, resulting in the last-minute hullabaloo to salvage international efforts known as the Copenhagen Accord. 
This weeks’ agreement does not mean, however, that the problem of <mark>climate change</mark> is solved. The U.S. and China are still on pace to add billions of metric tons of <mark>CO2</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> each year into the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> suggests that the world has already put into the atmosphere about <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-solve-global-warming-its-the-energy-supply/"">half the <mark>carbon</mark> it can</A> to avoid more than 2 degrees Celsius of global warming, and time is running out. Already, global average temperatures are up nearly 1 degree C and atmospheric concentrations of <mark>CO2</mark> have touched <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/report/400-ppm-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">400 parts-per-million</A> for the first time since <EM>Homo sapiens sapiens</EM> walked on Earth. 
The 28 nations of the European Union have pledged to cut greenhouse gas <mark>pollution</mark> by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, which means, including this new agreement, the countries responsible for more than half of the world's emissions now have plans to cut it. But other <A href=""http://theconversation.com/abbotts-blindsided-by-us-china-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-34151"">major polluters such as Australia</A>, Canada and Japan have all fallen back in their efforts to curb global warming <mark>pollution</mark>. Australia's <mark>pollution</mark> jumped after it repealed its <mark>carbon</mark> tax this year; Canada has repudiated its prior commitment to reduce <mark>pollution</mark> under the current international global warming agreement; and Japan's <mark>pollution</mark> has swelled as it burns more natural gas and coal to produce electricity to replace that generated by the nuclear reactors shuttered in the wake of the accident at Fukushima Daiichi. There is no guarantee that the U.S. or China might not also see similar setbacks on the road to less <mark>CO2</mark>, particularly given the <mark>climate</mark> denial politics that are rampant in the U.S. Congress and China's imperative to deliver continued economic growth or its history of <A href=""https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2013/06/11/who-is-fooling-who-when-it-comes-to-combating-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">gaming international <mark>carbon</mark> markets</A>. 
And a <A href=""http://blogs.cfr.org/levi/2014/11/10/booming-coal-use-isnt-just-about-china-its-india-too/"">new major polluter—India—has arrived</A> on the scene. In hoping to repeat China's development success it will burn more and more coal. Just as China has accounted for the bulk of rapidly rising <mark>climate</mark>-changing <mark>pollution</mark> in the first decades of the 21st century, India could soon take over driving that growth. But there is hope in the form of cleaner energy sources. New Prime Minister Narendra Modi is &quot;very engaged on renewables and solar power to electrify and provide energy access in India to hundreds of millions who don't have it,&quot; says Jennifer Morgan, global director of the <mark>climate</mark> program at the World Resources Institute, an environmental group. 
Plus, the new agreement is nowhere near ambitious enough to meet the reduction targets laid out in the most recent report of the IPCC. No country or league of countries—not even the E.U.—is on track to reduce <mark>pollution</mark> enough. Policy modeler Chris Hope of the University of Cambridge fed the <A href=""http://www.chrishopepolicy.com/2014/11/the-us-china-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-dont-get-carried-away/"">new commitments plus the E.U. effort into a computer model</A> under the assumption that other countries would continue to allow <mark>pollution</mark> to grow. He came out with &quot;less than a 1 percent chance of keeping the rise in global mean temperatures below the iconic 2 [degree C] level in 2100. Most likely the rise will be about 3.8 [degrees C].&quot; In other words, more needs to be done and China's level of striving to reach peak <mark>pollution</mark> before 2030 will prove crucial. 
The world still has a long way to go to combat <mark>climate change</mark> and even this new inadequate agreement will require some <A href=""http://e360.yale.edu/feature/green_energys_big_challenge__the_daunting_task_of_scaling_up/2362/"">tough, perhaps impossible, efforts</A> from the U.S. and China. &quot;We're nowhere near the world we need to be in to achieve our most ambitious <mark>climate</mark> goals,&quot; says Valerie Karplus, director of the Tsinghua-M.I.T. China Energy and <mark>Climate</mark> Project. &quot;We need to recognize that reality and think where do we go from here.&quot; 
But just as John Kerry did when he was the <A href=""https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/WSS/post.php?blog=43&amp;post=897"">lone U.S. senator to hold a press conference back in Copenhagen</A> in 2009 stressing the importance of this issue, as Secretary of State in 2013 and 2014 has <A href=""http://blogs.state.gov/stories/2014/11/11/china-america-and-our-warming-planet"">pressed the issue of combating <mark>climate change</mark></A> with his Chinese counterparts. As a result, the U.S. and China have now begun to show that it just might be possible for the nations of the world to stop global warming for the first time since the Kyoto Protocol was signed in the 1990s. As Obama also said in his joint press conference with Xi: &quot;When we work together, it's good for the United States, it's good for China and it is good for the world.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3><SECTION class=""article-author""><DIV class=""article-author__main""><P class=""article-author__name t_body t_body--article"">David Biello</P><P class=""article-author__desc t_body t_body--article"">David Biello is a contributing editor at <EM>Scientific American</EM>.

At the UN in Geneva, he talked about a “hegemon imposing its will on others” and warned America about a “Thucydides trap”—the disaster that befell ancient Greece when the incumbent power, Sparta, failed to accommodate the rising one, Athens. In February Mr Xi told a conference on security in Beijing that China should “guide international society” towards a “more just and rational new world order”. Previously Mr Xi had ventured only that China should play a role in building such a world.</P><P class=""xhead"">Your consensus is nonsense</P><P>There was a time when America was urging China to step up its global game. In 2005 Robert Zoellick, then America’s deputy secretary of state, urged China to become a “responsible stakeholder” in the international system. But nothing much happened. After the financial crisis of 2008 there was excited talk in China and the West about a “China model” or “Beijing consensus”. This was supposedly an alternative to the so-called Washington consensus, a prescription of free-market economic policies for developing countries. But those who promoted a China model did not say that it should be adopted by other countries, only that it was right to reject what they saw as a one-size-fits-all Washington consensus. Is there more to it this time? Is China challenging America for global leadership?</P><P>To answer that, it is important to begin with the way China’s political system works. Policies rarely emerge fully formed in a presidential speech. Officials often prefer to send subtle signals about intended changes, in a way that gives the government room to retreat should the new approach fail. The signals are amplified by similar ones further down the system and fleshed out by controlled discussions in state-owned media. In the realm of foreign policy, all that is happening now.</P><P>Soon after Mr Xi’s comments in Davos and Beijing, the prime minister, Li Keqiang, gave his annual “work report”—a sort of state-of-the-nation speech. It included an unusually long passage about foreign policy and mentioned <EM class=""Italic"">quanqiu</EM> (meaning global) or <EM class=""Italic"">quanqiuhua </EM>(globalisation) 13 times. That compares with only five such mentions last year (see chart).</P><P>As is their wont, state-run media have distilled the new thinking into numerical mnemonics. They refer enthusiastically to Mr Xi’s remarks on globalisation and a new world order as the “two guides”. And they have begun to discuss the makings of an idea that, unlike the old one of a China model, the country would like to sell to others. This is the so-called “China solution”. The phrase was first mentioned last July, on the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. Mr Xi’s celebratory speech asserted that the Chinese people were “fully confident that they can provide a China solution to humanity’s search for better social institutions”. The term has gone viral. Baidu, China’s most popular search engine, counts 22m usages of its Chinese rendering: <EM class=""Italic"">Zhongguo fang’an</EM>.</P><P>No one has defined what the China solution is. But, whatever it means, there is one for everything. Strengthening global government? There is a China solution to that, said the <EM class=""Italic"">People’s Daily</EM>, the party’s main mouthpiece, in mid-March. <mark>Climate change</mark>? “The next step is for us to bring China’s own solution,” said Xie Zhenhua, the government’s special <mark>climate</mark> envoy, in another newspaper, <EM class=""Italic"">Southern Metropolis</EM>. There is even a China solution to the problem of bolstering the rule of law, claimed an article in January in <EM class=""Italic"">Study Times</EM>, a weekly for officials. Multi-billion-dollar investments in infrastructure in Central Asia are China’s solution to poverty and instability there. And so on. Unlike the China model, which its boosters said was aimed at developing countries, the China solution, says David Kelly of China Policy, a consultancy, is for everyone—including Western countries.</P><P>This marks a change. Chinese leaders never praised the China model; its fans were mainly Chinese academics and the country’s cheerleaders in the West. (Long before the term became fashionable, Deng advised the president of Ghana: “Do not follow the China model.”) Most officials were wary of it because the term could be interpreted as China laying down the law to others, contradicting its policy of not interfering in other countries’ internal affairs. In contrast, it was Mr Xi himself who broached the idea of the China solution. His prime minister included it in his work report. China now seems more relaxed about bossing others around.</P><P>This reflects not only the determination of the leadership to play a bigger role, but a growing confidence that China can do it. China’s self-assurance has been bolstered by what it sees as recent foreign-policy successes. Last year an international tribunal ruled against China’s claims to sovereignty in much of the South China Sea. But China promptly persuaded the Philippines, which had brought the case, implicitly to disavow its legal victory, eschew its once-close ties with America and sign a deal accepting vast quantities of Chinese investment. Soon after that Malaysia, another hitherto America-leaning country with maritime claims overlapping those of China, came to a similar arrangement. China’s leaders concluded that, despite the tribunal’s ruling, 2016 had been a good year for them in the South China Sea.</P><P>It was certainly a notable one for Mr Xi’s most ambitious foreign policy, called the “Belt and Road Initiative”. The scheme involves infrastructure investment along the old Silk Road between China and Europe. The value of contracts signed under the scheme came within a whisker of $1trn last year—not bad for something that only started in 2013. Chinese exports to the 60-odd Belt and Road countries overtook those to America and the European Union. In May Mr Xi is due to convene a grand summit of the countries to celebrate and advertise a project that could one day rival transatlantic trade in importance.</P><P>But talk of “guiding globalisation” and a “China solution” does not mean China is turning its back on the existing global order or challenging American leadership of it across the board. China is a revisionist power, wanting to expand influence within the system. It is neither a revolutionary power bent on overthrowing things, nor a usurper, intent on grabbing global control.</P><P>China is the third-largest donor to the UN’s budget after America and Japan (see chart) and is the second-largest contributor, after America, to the UN’s peacekeeping. Last year China chaired a summit of the Group of 20 largest economies—it has an above-average record of complying with the G20’s decisions. Recently it has stepped up its multilateral commitments. In 2015 it secured the adoption of the yuan as one of the IMF’s five reserve currencies. It has set up two financial institutions, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank, which are modelled on traditional ones such as the World Bank. Global rules on trade and finance, it seems, are too important for Mr Xi not to defend.</P><P>China is becoming a more active participant in the UN, but it is not trying to dominate it. It reacts to, rather than initiates, sanctions policy towards North Korea. And despite its own extensive anti-terrorist operations at home, it shows little interest in joining, let alone leading, operations against Islamic State.</P><P>There are domestic constraints on Mr Xi’s ambitions. China’s vast bureaucracy is resistant to change in foreign policy, as in everything else. During a recent trip to Australia the foreign minister, Wang Yi, said China had “no intention of leading anybody”. He was not contradicting Mr Xi, but neither was he echoing the president’s desire to guide a new world order. Ding Yifang of the Institute of World Development, a think-tank in Beijing, is similarly cautious about the China solution. “We don’t have universal ideals,” he says. “We are not that ambitious.”</P><P class=""xhead"">Globalism with Chinese characteristics</P><P>So what might China’s unassuming new assertiveness mean in practice? A template can be found in <mark>climate</mark>-change policy. China was one of the main obstacles to a global <mark>climate</mark> agreement in 2008, but now its words are the lingua franca of <mark>climate</mark>-related diplomacy. Parts of a deal on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions between Mr Xi and Barack Obama were incorporated wholesale into the Paris <mark>climate</mark> treaty of 2016. China helped determine how that accord defines what are known as “common and differentiated responsibilities”, namely how much each country should be responsible for cutting emissions.</P><P>As chairman of the G20 last year, Mr Xi made the fight against <mark>climate change</mark> a priority for the group. But China’s clout at that time was bolstered by its accord with America. Now Mr Trump is beginning to dismantle his predecessor’s <mark>climate</mark> policies. Li Shou of Greenpeace says China is therefore preparing to go it alone as Mr Xie, the <mark>climate</mark> envoy, said in January that it was prepared to do. It may be that a “China solution” to <mark>climate change</mark> will be the first practical application of the term.</P><P>Soon after Mr Xi’s speech in Davos, Zhang Jun, a senior Foreign Ministry official, put his finger on China’s changing place in the world. “I would say it is not China rushing to the front,” he told a newspaper in Hong Kong, “but rather the front-runners have stepped back, leaving the place to China.” But officials have far fewer qualms than Deng did about being at the front. “If China is required to play a leadership role,” says Mr Zhang, “it will assume its responsibilities.”</P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><FOOTER itemprop=""publication"" class=""blog-post__foot-note"">This article appeared in the<SPAN itemprop=""articleSection"">China</SPAN>section of the print edition under the headline<SPAN>&quot;Tortoise v hare&quot;</SPAN></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

They receive about $25 billion in tax breaks per decade. That is some serious money. As a country, these five companies together would be around #12 in GDP.. somewhere between South Korea and Australia. And that's just the top five in the USA.  The entire budget ask in 2013 for the US Government's U.S. Global Change Research Program was $2.6 billion. Simply put, taxpayers are paying nearly 10x as much to promote <mark>climate change</mark> denial as they are to actually address <mark>climate change</mark>. And the amount to this program peaked in 1995, the last budget year President Clinton had Democratic control in Congress. And that's just the top five... there's a pretty long tail to this industry.  Koch Industries, for example, takes in around $110 billion in revenue every year... they're privately held, we don't know the profits. But we do know that Charles and David Koch have promised to spend what's now up to $1 billion for the 2016 election, to elect the people they would like to see running the USA. That's more than either the Republican or Democratic Parties will be able to spend... and every penny is going to elect a <mark>climate change</mark> denier. And we'd like to believe that other huge oil and gas companies like Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, <mark>Petro China</mark>, Pemex, etc. are not spending lobbying or other <mark>climate</mark> denial money in the USA, since they don't operate here. But there's no actual way to know, with all the dark money involved in politics these days. That's hundreds of billions being spent toward just the 2016 election that is completely untraceable -- we have no idea where this money comes from. It might not be China.... But back to what we do know... think of it this way: if just the top 5 oil producers were to spend $1.2 billion per year on <mark>climate change</mark> denial activities (bribing Congress, PR campaigns, FUD over gas supplies, fake science, electing anti-science candidates, etc), they would be getting a 100% return on that investment if those efforts kept those tax breaks intact. And it's not even remotely that expensive in practice. Congress, for example, is very cheap to purchase. The average Congressional campaign costs just over a million dollars in total, the average Senatorial campaign runs about ten million dollars. That's lots of money, but it's not as if they need to fund entire campaigns. And thanks to gerrymandering, there are plenty of &quot;safe&quot; districts they don't need to worry about. This is way it's totally ludicrous when a <mark>climate</mark> denier suggests that <mark>climate</mark> scientists are pro-<mark>climate change</mark> because there's money in it. That's simply an application of the Karl Rove Doctrine: take your greatest weakness and attack that in your opponent, regardless of whether it makes any sense at all. All of the money is in denial of <mark>climate change</mark>.</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

That year, on the eve of China’s most important holiday, the Spring Festival, rare freezing temperatures and heavy rain nearly paralysed the entire south of the country. Thanks to the wide reach of the internet, every extreme-weather event since, including Typhoon Hato in 2017, has attracted massive attention. The smog that arrives predictably each winter has made air <mark>pollution</mark> one of the most widely discussed topics among the Chinese. The people have moved from ignorance to fighting for the right to information, to taking the initiative, to demanding government action. 
</P><P data-reactid="".mc5whq4xds.1.0.0.1.0.2.$4"">During recent trade summits, the Chinese government temporarily shut down many industrial businesses in order to clear the air and save its face. But that does nothing to save the planet. China is the world’s largest emitter of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. It is now working to put its own house in order.
</P><P data-reactid="".mc5whq4xds.1.0.0.1.0.2.$5""><mark>Climate change</mark> and air <mark>pollution</mark> are related, but not identical, issues. Most air <mark>pollution</mark> is produced by the same sources that emit <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide: heating, power generation, industrial activity and cars. That means controlling <mark>pollution</mark> can also mean cutting emissions. This can be seen as the uniquely Chinese path to tackling <mark>climate change</mark> in 2018 and beyond.
</P><P data-reactid="".mc5whq4xds.1.0.0.1.0.2.$6"">In 2009 China announced plans to cut its <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by 40-45% relative to GDP growth by 2020, compared with 2005 levels. Then, in 2014, it said it wanted <mark>carbon</mark>-emission levels to peak around 2030, and would even try to move this date forward if possible. This marked a striking shift, from emphasising lowering the concentration of emissions to trying to control total levels. Under China’s current political system, the central government breaks down <mark>carbon</mark>-emission targets for different levels of government. Now, checks on targets are becoming more stringent. The party may urge more advanced regions to meet goals ahead of schedule. 
</P><P data-reactid="".mc5whq4xds.1.0.0.1.0.2.$7"">Even after Donald Trump said he would pull America out of the Paris agreement on <mark>climate change</mark>, the attitude of China’s government and people has not regressed. Rather, many have called upon the country to take on more responsibility for the sake of all humanity.
</P><P class=""crosshead"">Warming on the idea</P><P data-reactid="".mc5whq4xds.1.0.0.1.0.2.$9"">What measures will it take? Recent efforts to cut overcapacity are the starting-point. Overcapacity is primarily concentrated in high-emission industries such as steel and coal. The government wants to control the capacity of these sectors. Industrial businesses will feel the force of strict environmental and <mark>carbon</mark>-emissions regulations. This inextricably links progress to economic reforms and efforts to improve regional industrial structures. Ultimately, this is a matter of governance.
</P><P data-reactid="".mc5whq4xds.1.0.0.1.0.2.$10"">China’s economic development has reached a stage in which manufacturing is giving way to service industries. Goods like steel, cement and glass have already reached their peak output, or will soon do so. Solutions to <mark>climate change</mark> are compatible with China’s transition. 
</P><P data-reactid="".mc5whq4xds.1.0.0.1.0.2.$11"">In the short term, the country will face economic and social costs from its actions, including slower growth and rising unemployment. That means the social safety-net will need to be shored up. Also, China’s emphasis must move from mitigation of <mark>climate change</mark> to adaptation to it. That involves upgrading infrastructure, changing lifestyles and further raising public consciousness. In the long run, as China’s industries shift from manufacturing to services, social resistance to the economic effects of <mark>climate</mark>-change action will decrease.
</P><P data-reactid="".mc5whq4xds.1.0.0.1.0.2.$12"">Current achievements are still a long way from meeting the expectations of the people. China’s <mark>climate</mark> awakening means the country needs to put in a long-term effort to adopt more intensive and effective measures to cope with global warming. Luckily, Chinese people have by now realised the true meaning of the idea, “We only have one Earth.”

Perhaps nowhere does the struggle between wild and manicured feel more palpable than in Ecuador, and nowhere in Ecuador is the battle for biological and cultural diversity more profound than in Yasuní National Park.  </P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION> A species of lizard called the banded anole (<EM>Anolis stratulatus</EM>).</FIGCAPTION><CITE>Phil Torres</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""zHTMjs"">Situated on Ecuador's easternmost flank with Peru to the south and east and Colombia only a short distance north, the 6,101-square-mile park sits at the confluence of the western Amazon basin, the Andean foothills, and the equator. The park’s boundary encircles one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet. A single hectare, an area roughly the size of a soccer field, might boast as many as 655 different kinds of trees, more than all native tree species in the continental US and Canada. </P><P id=""ssddBY"">Some 500 fish species and 600 kinds of birds live in Yasuní’s streams and skies.

Almost a billion barrels of it, around 20 percent of Ecuador's untapped oil reserves. (By comparison, North America's largest oil field, in Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, originally held 25 billion barrels.) </P><P id=""Wr1Fd0"">For a small country dependent on oil exports for a third of its federal budget, those riches have been tantalizing. Yet Ecuador has resisted, even going so far as to ask other countries to contribute to a campaign to help it avoid extracting Yasuní’s oil. The move wasn't intended as a bribe, proponents said, but rather as acknowledgement that the health of Amazonian forests has global <mark>climate</mark> implications. </P><P id=""Q4KWxT"">Then in the spring of 2016, in a move that shocked the international conservation community, Ecuador began trucking the first barrels of crude out of Yasuní. Is this the beginning of the end for one of the world’s most biodiverse ecosystems? It’s certainly a pivotal moment. The tiny country is now poised to cash in on one of its most valuable assets — but at what cost to Yasuní’s countless inhabitants, and to the world? </P><P id=""Ali34V"">To understand how oil extraction begins inside a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve such as Yasuní National Park, we need to step back a decade. </P><P id=""cq8uqg"">In 2007, Rafael Correa ascended to Ecuador's presidency in part on the basis of his promise to distance the nation from American interests. </P><P id=""1EpkL0"">Then in 2008, the country defaulted on some $3 billion worth of debt. Desperate for an influx of cash, Correa struck a deal in 2009, not with the US but with China: oil for cash. The $1 billion loan agreement stipulated that Ecuador's state oil company, Petroecuador, would sell crude oil to Petrochina, the world's second-largest publicly traded oil corporation.</P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>The Repsol Oil station, at the entrance of Yasuní National Park.</FIGCAPTION><CITE>Phil Torres</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""pQlUfx"">“At the outset, many people talked about how mutually beneficial this was for both countries,” says Kevin Koenig, Ecuador program director for AmazonWatch, a nonprofit devoted to working with indigenous groups to protect the environment. </P><P id=""YLTNeH"">But the loans kept coming. In all, China has loaned Ecuador some $15 billion, plus another $7 billion in financing for the development of an oil refinery in Ecuador's port city of Manta. According to documents obtained by Reuters in 2013, China at the time was responsible for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's financing, while holding claim to almost 90 percent of its oil exports. </P><P id=""rgEVeD"">When the deal between the two countries was first struck, oil prices were soaring. But the value of a barrel of oil has since fallen to roughly half what it was then. Which means Ecuador has to come up with a lot more oil to repay its loans from China. As this need has grown, the crude resting beneath Yasuní has only looked more tempting.</P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>Oil pipelines carry oil from nearby wells across the Shiripuno River, which flows directly through Yasuní National Park.</FIGCAPTION><CITE>Phil Torres</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""qx3CVS"">Ecuador was the first nation to explicitly protect the rights of nature in its constitution, which prohibits the extraction of nonrenewable resources like oil from protected areas. It was in keeping with those regulations that Correa announced the innovative Yasuní-ITT initiative in September 2007. </P><P id=""oa5T47"">Launched on the eve of the global economic crisis and well before <mark>climate</mark> scientists officially declared that a bulk of the world's oil reserves must be left in the ground to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius or less, the Yasuní-ITT initiative now seems ahead of its time. The oil sitting beneath the Ishpingo Tambococha Tiputini (ITT) oil fields at the eastern edge of Yasuní was worth an estimated $7.2 billion in 2007 prices. Correa’s initiative proposed to leave it in the ground, but he wanted the rest of the world to pay Ecuador for half of the oil’s value to do so.</P><P id=""Pbc2it"">“Ecuador doesn’t ask for charity,” Correa said at the time, “but does ask that the international community share in the sacrifice and compensates us … in recognition of the environmental benefits that would be generated by keeping this oil underground.” What Correa didn’t say at the time was that the initiative also had a plan B: drilling.</P><P id=""4ByHOf"">It seemed like a no-brainer. Surely other countries would pitch in. </P><P id=""nUlc8K"">Unfortunately, the initiative came far short of raising the necessary funds. By 2013, the world had only ponied up a scant $13 million in actual donations, with another $200 million in promises. “The world has failed us,” Correa said in a televised address. “I have signed the executive decree for the liquidation of the Yasuní-ITT trust fund and with this, ended the initiative.” Plan B was going into effect.</P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>The blue-crowned manakin (<EM>Lepidothrix coronate</EM>) waits out the darkness until it’s safe to fly again.</FIGCAPTION><CITE>Phil Torres</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""NaNjTH"">At risk following the failure of the Yasuní-ITT is not only the area’s tremendous biodiversity but also the vast ecosystem services it provides, both to local indigenous communities and to the world as a whole. All the oil beneath the ITT fields would feed the world's energy demands for a mere 17 days, yet would release some 410 million metric tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into the atmosphere. Protecting it could have — and might still — set an example for the rest of Amazonia, and indeed the rest of the world, demonstrating a new strategy for simultaneously preserving biodiversity and combating <mark>climate change</mark> while allowing an oil-rich nation to remain economically prosperous. </P><P id=""cun79Q"">Even weighed against the astounding biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest in general, Yasuní National Park is noteworthy. “Yasuní has always stood out to me because of its species richness. It's unbelievable, unparalleled,” says wildlife biologist and photojournalist Phil Torres, who spent two years running a research station nearby.</P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>Unique species abound in Yasuní, like this rare and unusual spider egg structure, dubbed “Silkhenge” by the biologists who first discovered it.</FIGCAPTION><CITE>Phil Torres</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""kuIVuO"">The nearly 4,000 kinds of plants documented within Yasuní’s boundaries provide habitat for a whopping one-third of the reptile and bird species known in the Amazon, and nearly as many amphibians and mammals. Out of every 10 Amazonian fish, at least two swim in its streams and rivers. &quot;No other place on the planet has so many species of [reptiles and amphibians] in one single location,&quot; says herpetologist Alejandro Arteaga, co-founder of the ecotourism and research group Tropical Herping. All of this in an area that comprises less than one-fifth of 1 percent of the entire Amazon rainforest.</P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>The Amazon basin is a busy place at night, with reptiles like this collared tree runner (<EM>Plica plica</EM>) doing their best to stay in the role of predator, rather than prey.</FIGCAPTION><CITE>Phil Torres</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""RHFGhj"">While no one knows for certain which environmental factors have played the biggest role in creating Yasuní’s extreme biodiversity, it’s likely the combination of precipitation, temperature, and topography. The ecosystem in and around the park soaks up more than 3 meters of rainfall each year, with no real dry season. Because it is perpetually warm and wet, fruit and flowers remain available year-round. </P><P id=""k2wciw"">Another factor is its location, at the confluence of the Andes and the equator. The wide variety of habitats here has given rise to an equally wide variety of plants and animals specifically adapted to exploiting what those habitats have to offer. Yasuní is home to at least 20 species of amphibian, 19 birds, and four mammals found in the region and nowhere else on the planet. </P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>Omayue, a Huaorani community leader, holds a blowgun that he uses to hunt monkeys. </FIGCAPTION><CITE>Phil Torres</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""rjrPwx"">Indigenous people are an integral part of the ecological fabric in and around Yasuní as well. Groups like the Huaorani, the Tagaeri, and the Taromenane have carved out niches here, finding shelter, sustenance, and medicines in the natural resources of this rich landscape.</P><P id=""x8axp1"">In 1998, Ecuador ratified the International Labor Organization's (ILO) 169th convention, which guaranteed its indigenous people the right to free, prior, and informed consent before the government would allow anyone to extract natural resources from indigenous territories. The Ecuadorian constitution itself even describes extractive operations in indigenous territories as “ethnocide.”</P><P id=""UuJWMq"">In practice, the government can override these constitutional regulations if officials determine that drilling would be in the national interest. In such cases, oil companies send representatives to negotiate with indigenous groups living in the territories that the companies have leased from the government. </P><P id=""cmdcfk"">“My experience is that [the indigenous groups] get manipulated into accepting anything the oil company wants,” says biologist Kelly Swing, who has observed more than two decades of these negotiations in the area while directing the Tiputini Biodiversity Station, a research facility near Yasuní's northern border.  </P><P id=""jm4hrJ"">Swing explains that representatives typically offer educational opportunities, access to medical facilities, electricity, and jobs, as long as the indigenous people will allow them access to their lands. “But the financial incentive is for companies to follow through on as little as possible to save themselves money in the long run.” Even when health clinics are established, he adds, most are often left without supplies or personnel after a short while.  </P><P id=""Ld7jab"">Not all of Ecuador's indigenous groups have capitulated to the oil industry. In 2015, a delegation from the Kichwa community in Sarayaku, just south of Yasuní, attended COP21, the United Nations <mark>climate change</mark> meeting in Paris. “Our people are committed and determined to make sure that there is no oil, no mining, no industrial development on our territories,” said Kichwa leader Patricia Gualinga through a translator. Her Kichwa community has successfully kept oil out of their territory for a decade.</P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>This cicada (<EM>Zamarra sp.</EM>) is one of the more colorful species in Yasuní — and also one of the loudest, typically calling raucously throughout the day.</FIGCAPTION><CITE>Phil Torres</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""1M5TrM"">Despite the failure of the Yasuní-ITT, all is not lost. Scientists and conservationists say there’s still time to protect Yasuní from severe ecological harm even after drilling has begun. According to Swing, oil extraction itself is not the primary cause of ecological <mark>devastation</mark>. That can happen in the event of a massive spill, “but loss of forest, horizon to horizon, is much more likely to be caused by squatters who show up along access roads.” </P><P id=""2MmjJS"">When Torres first came to Ecuador in 2010, he became familiar with one road near his research station. Initially, the dirt track was narrow enough that the forest's canopy remained intact, allowing passage to monkeys, macaws, and everything else. Before long, the road was widened, spanning 30 meters in some spots. Then came electrical lines, and road lights. “As I was leaving in 2012, they were going to bring in asphalt,” he says.</P><P id=""3pFMkf"">Initially built and subsequently expanded to transport supplies and workers to the oil fields, and to haul out the oil, roads end up providing an irresistible pathway for the illegal harvest of timber and bushmeat and the extraction of precious metals and gems. “We had photos of hunters on the camera traps we set up to see wild animals,” says Torres.</P><P id=""O4jP1S"">As a result, the forest was slowly being deprived of its megafauna. “There was one jaguar sighting in three years. I saw a pair of macaws only twice in one year,” Torres recalls. Small tamarin monkeys that aren't worth hunting stuck around, but the meatier howler monkeys, whose calls can travel more than 3 miles through the jungle, were only heard two or three times each year. After leaving Ecuador and spending time in a well-protected part of the Peruvian Amazon, Torres began to understand what Peru had and what this part of Ecuador had lost. “There were macaws everywhere, and I'd see 50 monkeys every day,” he says. </P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>While the black market pet trade poses the most significant threat to the brightly colored birds in the Amazon, mammals can end up victims, too. This tayra (<EM>Eira barbara</EM>) was found at a market with a rope around its neck. It was purchased and brought to the research station, where it could be cared for with the hope of releasing it back into the wild.</FIGCAPTION><CITE>Phil Torres</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""lCrNrX"">The consequences from the loss of large animals has been called “empty forest syndrome.” To the naked eye, these forests appear intact. Only a closer look reveals what's missing. Jaguars may not be formally extinct, but if their populations have been reduced to such an extent that they can no longer perform their ecological role in maintaining the Amazon ecosystem, then they might be thought of as ecologically extinct. “We must not let a forest full of trees fool us into believing that all is well,” wrote tropical ecologist Kent H. Redford in 1992.</P><P id=""ZJrr35"">Yasuní does not suffer from empty forest syndrome — at least not yet. “What really, really stands out are the amphibians, the reptiles, the insects, the plants,” Torres says of his first visit to the park last year. “I've never seen so many different things in such a short period of time.” The biodiversity won't disappear overnight, but as roads are carved through the forest, as rivers and streams are modified to accommodate larger barges, Yasuní risks becoming what biologist Daniel H. Janzen has called “living dead.”</P><P id=""01F0AZ"">Swing has argued that “offshore” strategies, in which supplies and oil are transported via helicopter rather than by truck, could possibly keep empty forest syndrome away from Yasuní, which already has at least four access roads. “Having isolated oil platforms scattered across the landscape,” Swing wrote in 2011 in the journal <EM>Nature</EM>, “has to be better than horizon-to-horizon deforestation.”</P><P id=""57cHtx"">Koenig from AmazonWatch takes a different tack, hoping instead that existing oil fields can be squeezed to produce enough oil that whatever remains beneath Yasuní can still be left alone. While just one well operates today, plans call for as many as 200. “If we're talking about 200 wells, I'm not sure why it's still called a park,” he says.</P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>A family of tapirs visits the Yasuní Catolica Biological Field Station several times a week. </FIGCAPTION><CITE>Phil Torres</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""NRniJU"">Conservationists like Koenig have a way of remaining pathologically optimistic, perhaps as a psychological bulwark against the daily onslaught of upsetting news. He imagines a future in which Amazonian oil extraction becomes so socially unacceptable, in which indigenous groups are so well supported by the rest of the world, that the oil industry finds leasing new concessions to be too financially risky. That could force Ecuador and China to negotiate a new arrangement. </P><P id=""XjYoIJ"">“It's kind of a grim picture, [but] there's now a growing awareness in Ecuador of the amazing place they have, and a huge evolution and recognition of indigenous rights for Ecuador's Amazonian people,” says Koenig. </P><P id=""KtyMOv"">“It's not only a struggle of indigenous peoples, it's not only those who are on the front lines. It's all of us,” said the Kichwa leader Gualinga in concluding her speech at COP21. “Yes, we have to have respect for indigenous people, but we have to respect all life. We have to respect future generations. If we do this together, we will make change,” she said.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

When it listed in Shanghai in 2007, bubbles in both oil and the Chinese equity market were primed to burst, while the global financial crisis was just around the corner. Measured against the 73 per cent drop in China's CSI 300 Energy Index over the past decade, PetroChina's 82 per cent retreat doesn't look quite so bad.</P><P data-reactid=""478"">And as Citigroup analyst Nelson Wang points out, most of PetroChina's shares are owned by the Chinese government, so the hit to minority investors hasn't been as big as the loss in total market value might suggest.</P></DIV><DIV class=""_1665V undefined"" data-reactid=""481""><FIGURE class=""_3ujPS _3g3zI"" data-reactid=""482""><FIGCAPTION class=""_3CZmy"" data-reactid=""488""><P data-reactid=""489"">The double whammy of oil's 44 per cent drop over the last 10 years and Chinese President Xi Jinping's ambitious plans to promote electric vehicles have hit PetroChina hard. </P><CITE data-reactid=""490"">Photo: AP</CITE></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P data-reactid=""494"">On Hong Kong's exchange, where PetroChina first listed in April 2000, stockholders have enjoyed strong long-term gains. The company's so-called H shares have returned about 735 per cent since their debut, outpacing the city's benchmark Hang Seng Index by more than 500 per centage points. (Dual listings are common among Chinese companies, which often sell stock to international investors in Hong Kong.)</P><P data-reactid=""496"">The H shares, which account for less than 12 per cent of PetroChina's total shares outstanding and trade at a discount to their Shanghai counterparts, may rise 31 per cent over the next year, according to the latest price target from Laban Yu, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Jefferies Group LLC. PetroChina could return a &quot;huge&quot; amount of cash to shareholders if it decides to start spinning off pipeline assets, Yu said in an interview last week.</P><P data-reactid=""498"">A spokesman for Beijing-based PetroChina, which is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Monday, declined to comment.</P><P data-reactid=""500"">When it comes to PetroChina's Shanghai-traded shares, analysts are unusually pessimistic. The energy producer is one of just a handful of large-cap Chinese companies with more sell ratings than buys, and the stock's projected loss of 16 per cent compares with an average estimated gain of about 10 per cent for shares in China's large-cap CSI 300 Index.</P></DIV><DIV class=""_1665V undefined"" data-reactid=""503""><P data-reactid=""504"">Valuation is one reason for the bearish outlook. Even after its slump, PetroChina's forward price-to-earnings ratio in Shanghai is 80 per cent higher than its historical average. And while the shares were more richly valued in 2007, it seems improbable that China's government would allow such heady market conditions to return anytime soon. Authorities have intervened to prevent excessive swings in Chinese stocks over the past year, seeking to avoid a repeat of the boom-bust cycles that whipsawed investors in 2007 and 2015.</P><P data-reactid=""506"">Even if the government does loosen its grip, today's market darlings are more likely to be found in the technology and consumer industries than in &quot;old economy&quot; sectors like oil. President Xi, who cemented his status China's strongest leader in decades at last week's Communist Party congress, has emphasised the need for more environmentally-friendly growth.

Yasuni was never up for negotiation. Your claim is totally baseless and was made without any credible evidence. The 2009 &quot;government document&quot; that you cite as proof for this claim is fraudulent. It was with a heavy heart that Ecuador last year cancelled the Yasuni Initiative launched in 2007, a ground-breaking idea based on sharing responsibilities in the important battle against <mark>climate change</mark>. Under it, Ecuador would have forgone half of the oil revenues that it would have received for exploiting oil in this area of the Amazon if, as compensation, it received the other half through international donations placed in a UN administered trust. As I wrote in The Guardian at the time: &quot;Without international political will to give the financial support, the Yasuní initiative was never going to succeed. Tragically, it was the fundamental reason it did not. Despite strenuous efforts by the Ecuadorian government, including establishing a secretary of state devoted to this scheme, the financial backing fell way short… In fact, just 0.37% of the target was provided by international donors. This made the scheme unworkable.&quot;The allegation that Ecuador was negotiating oil exploitation in Yasuni with a Chinese company whilst simultaneously pushing the Yasuni Initiative wrongly implies that Ecuador was never serious in making the scheme work. More widely, it is designed to portray the Ecuadorean government as duplicitous.You allege as evidence for your claim a so-called &quot;Last minute clause&quot; in a document stating &quot;the Ecuadorian party has said it will do all it can to help Petrochina and Andes Petroleum explore ITT and Block 31 [the Yasuni area]&quot;. But Ecuador never agreed to such a clause. This was an idea proposed by the Chinese party during discussions on a development loan totally unrelated to Yasuni. Ecuador immediately rejected that idea. To emphasise this, Ecuador even included a reference to this unacceptable clause in documents with the words that you quote crossed out. In fact, it was over this difference that the talks, at that time, ended. Evidence also suggests that the author of what we believe is a modified document is an opponent of Ecuador's government. Such distortions about Ecuador are increasingly stemming from powerful opponents – as we believe has this document – at home and abroad. They are designed to damage the reputation and undermine international support of both, Ecuador's Citizens Revolution and a government that has approval ratings of over 70%, the highest in Latin America.</P></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE><DIV class=""submeta""><SPAN class=""submeta__label"">Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

While Chinese oil firms are majority state-owned enterprises that are run by senior-ranking Chinese Communist Party officials, tensions have nevertheless arisen in recent years between company leadership and the government over pricing and strategy, with particular concerns in Beijing that state-owned enterprises such as the big three are abusing their privileged position for private gain. </P><P>Keen to maximize their own profitability, the big three pressured senior officials to modify government directives that were perceived to negatively impact their profits. For example, the oil and gas company PetroChina (a <A href=""http://www.petrochina.com.cn/Ptr/Investor_Relations/Corporate_Governance_Structure/gszljg_6.htm?COLLCC=4020070688&amp;"">listed company</A> mostly held by CNPC) tried to block foreign investment in the country’s West–East gas pipeline even though doing so contradicted the initial wishes of China’s central government. PetroChina was successful and currently owns and operates the pipeline.</P><P>The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)—the country’s top economic planner that controls oil pricing—<A href=""http://english.caixin.com/2014-03-12/100650349.html"">may be losing influence</A>. The regime has pledged to shift approval for projects launched by private investors away from the NDRC, giving market players a more significant role both domestically and internationally. Such a change in decisionmaking responsibilities could <A href=""http://english.caixin.com/2014-03-12/100650349.html"">produce unexpected outcomes</A>. </P><P>The weakness of China’s regulatory institutions coupled with the national oil companies’ strong political position has allowed Chinese oil companies and refiners to attenuate Beijing’s efforts to both improve the environmental situation in the country and formulate a more modern, comprehensive energy strategy. This is particularly true in the case of failed efforts to close and clean up dirty, outdated refineries in Shandong Province. It is also exemplified by national oil companies’ ability to stall efforts by the Ministry of Environmental Protection to improve petroleum and diesel quality as smog has intensified in Beijing. Going forward, as China begins to contemplate further reforms in state-owned enterprises, particular attention should be paid to the oil sector. </P><H3>Mapping China’s Oil Resources</H3><P>China’s indigenous oil reserves are diverse, ranging from heavier conventional pooled oils and tight oils trapped in shale rock to extra-heavy kerogen and bitumen oil resources. The country’s national energy companies believe tight oils present <A href=""http://www.energyandcapital.com/articles/china-shale-oil-investing/3670"">relatively lucrative opportunities</A> among unconventional hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s.</P><P>As of 2013, China possessed an estimated <A href=""http://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/worldshalegas/pdf/fullreport.pdf"">25.6 billion barrels</A> of proved conventional oil reserves.<SUP>2</SUP> China also has an estimated <A href=""http://www.adv-res.com/pdf/A_EIA_ARI_2013%20World%20Shale%20Gas%20and%20Shale%20Oil%20Resource%20Assessment.pdf"">32 billion barrels</A> of shale oil resources—10 percent of the globe’s technically recoverable tight oil resources. Rounding out China’s unconventional heavy oil resource potential is an additional <A href=""http://www.rigzone.com/training/heavyoil/insight.asp?i_id=286"">19.8 billion tons</A> (over 100 billion barrels) of onshore heavy oil in place—including approximately 3 billion tons of oil sands (bitumen) and 16 billion tons of oil shale (kerogen). It is unclear at present how much more heavy oil is offshore.</P><P>The bulk of China’s known shale oil is located in five basins—Jianghan, Greater Subei, Tarim, Junggar, and Songliao. Oil reserves also span the border into Mongolia in the East Gobi, Tamtsag, and Erlian Basins and skirt southeast of Beijing in the Bohai Bay Basin. Additional tight oil deposits are found in the Sichuan and <A href=""http://www.searchanddiscovery.com/pdfz/documents/2012/80230zou/ndx_zou.pdf.html"">Ordos Basins</A> spanning the center of China, which is home to the country’s oldest oil fields. Heavy oils, both bitumen and kerogen resources, are also located throughout China (see map).</P><P>China’s shale oil resources tend to be waxy and buried in deposits that are rich in clay, making them poor candidates for hydraulic fracturing (fracking) techniques that are currently used to extract other tight oils by injecting fluids or gases into rock formations to break them open and release the resources. And unlike the tight oils found in the United States in Texas and North Dakota, tight oils in China tend to be heavier and have a lower percentage of lighter condensates. Heavy oil is more <mark>carbon</mark> laden than lighter oil, and current extraction practices involve <A href=""http://www.rigzone.com/training/heavyoil/insight.asp?i_id=286"">pumping <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in addition to steam</A>, which can make the recovery process even more <mark>carbon</mark> intensive.</P><P>China’s shale oils are typically buried deep underground—over <A href=""http://www.adv-res.com/pdf/China_Shale_Gas_and_Shale_Oil_Resource_Evaluation_and_Technical_Challenges_SPE165832_Scott_Stevens_Keith_Moodhe_Vello_Kuuskraa_2013_10_22-24.pdf"">5 kilometers</A>—and in hard, thick geologic formations. That means they require large inputs of energy and water to extract and extraction processes yield substantial quantities of contaminated produced water. The Tarim Basin in Xinjiang Province is known to have <A href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146638012001787"">ultra-deep heavy oils</A> that are some of the deepest in China, buried over 6 kilometers. </P><P>Economics will play a major role in determining whether these resources can be recovered. Horizontal drilling and other complex technologies used to extract these tight and heavy oils are particularly expensive in China. Pipeline infrastructure needed to transport the resources once they are extracted is not highly developed in the country. Years of unrestricted spending on mergers and acquisitions have eaten away at profits. </P><P>As China’s national oil companies look to become more cost competitive by increasing efficiency, improving governance, and honing technical wherewithal, they could help raise <A href=""http://www.platts.com/IM.Platts.Content/ProductsServices/Products/energyeconomist.pdf"">China’s standing</A> in terms of oil development at home and abroad. </P><P>Oil development must also contend with geographic and geologic challenges. Oil stores in the east lie in major urban regions, so their development can impinge on the public. In the west, oil resources are relatively inaccessible; vast distances and difficult terrain separate them from markets. And the numerous active seismic faults surrounding these shale oil resources make them even <A href=""http://www.adv-res.com/pdf/A_EIA_ARI_2013%20World%20Shale%20Gas%20and%20Shale%20Oil%20Resource%20Assessment.pdf"">less conducive to development</A>. </P><P>Despite these challenges, <A href=""http://www.adv-res.com/pdf/A_EIA_ARI_2013%20World%20Shale%20Gas%20and%20Shale%20Oil%20Resource%20Assessment.pdf"">unconventional oil is being pursued</A> in China. In 2010, for example, Hess, a U.S. energy company, and PetroChina conducted a joint study of tight oil in the Daqing oil field. Jilin Oilfield Company, a subsidiary of PetroChina, has undertaken massive fracturing operations in the Changling gas field, and breakthroughs made there could be applied to tight oil reservoirs to liberate more resources. And American energy giant ConocoPhillips has teamed up with Sinopec to conduct <A href=""http://fuelfix.com/blog/2012/12/26/conocophillips-eyes-unconventional-oil-and-gas-in-china/"">tight oil exploration in Sichuan Province</A>. </P><P>Oil ventures will likely continue to be undertaken. However, these projects are expected to become more difficult and costly over time. Increasingly, they will have to prove their profitability if they are to survive China’s new economic reforms that stress anticorruption efforts and rethink asset accumulation. </P><H3>China’s Oil Investments Abroad </H3><P>China has been eager to invest in overseas oil projects as well, a drive stoked by strategic concerns about supply disruption, the desire to acquire new technology, and efforts to profit from changes in the upstream oil sector. And Chinese companies have set ambitious targets for increasing direct ownership of oil fields, called equity oil. Most <A href=""http://qz.com/59997/chinese-oil-companies-arent-just-guzzling-venezuelan-oil-theyre-profiting-from-it/"">equity oil gets resold on the world market</A> and never reaches China. In 2012, overseas operations for PetroChina accounted for 37 percent of the company’s oil and gas production.</P><P>In the same year, the total value of mergers and acquisitions undertaken by China’s three biggest oil companies climbed to a reported <A href=""http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20130203000100&amp;cid=1102"">$34 billion</A>, doubling from a reported <A href=""http://www.ie-ei.eu/Ressources/file/memoires/2013/FRANCISCO.pdf"">$17 billion</A> in 2008. And 2013 saw the unconventional oil (and gas) investments that China’s national oil companies made abroad at least double and become distributed more widely—<A href=""http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Global_oil_and_gas_transactions_review_2013/$FILE/EY-Global_oil_and_gas_transactions_review_2013.pdf"">in Peru, New Zealand, New Caledonia, East Africa, and the Russian Arctic</A>. When bank loans are included, China has invested an estimated $400 billion in foreign oil development over the past five years (see figure 2). </P><P>Despite indications that China’s big three may have reservations about the profitability of North American unconventional oil production, they have been <A href=""http://www.resourcesquarterly.com/china-and-its-rush-for-foreign-oil/"">eager to invest in emerging plays</A> on the continent. China is attracted to North America’s transforming energy market and to the potential that market holds for China to acquire the latest technology and learn to replicate emerging industry practices. </P><P>This type of investment has become easier over time. CNOOC attempted and failed to acquire the U.S. petroleum company Unocal (now part of Chevron) in 2005, which exposed fears in the United States that China would make major investments in strategic sectors. More recently, however, Canada welcomed China’s involvement with CNOOC’s $15.1 billion purchase of Canadian oil and gas company Nexen and the $2.1 billion acquisition of the bankrupt Canadian oil sands developer OPTI in 2011. </P><P>Although China’s national oil companies have gained political confidence in navigating the North American energy landscape, it is unclear whether they will be major players in the North American energy revolution in the future. <A href=""http://business.financialpost.com/2013/12/07/life-after-cnoocs-nexen-deal-is-chinas-honeymoon-with-canadas-oil-patch-over/?__lsa=91c3-5e91"">CNOOC appears to be pulling back</A> in North America, while <A href=""http://business.financialpost.com/2014/03/18/sinopec-in-talks-to-buy-15-in-petronas-canada-lng-project/?__lsa=cd5a-05dc"">Sinopec’s energy activity</A> looks to be increasing.</P><P>As China’s demand for crude and petroleum products for feedstock and fuels grows, it is eyeing new supplies from <A href=""http://carnegieendowment.org/2013/05/28/opportunities-and-challenges-confronting-russian-oil/g6x5"">Russia’s many different oils</A>, Canada’s oil sands, Venezuelan bitumen, Brazil’s pre-salt oil, and supplies elsewhere in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and beyond. Moreover, the Chinese refining sector—which is currently unequipped to convert extra-heavy oil sands and heavy oils to diesel and jet fuel—will be making key investments to handle the array of global oils. </P><H3>Growth in China’s Refining Sector </H3><P>At 13 million barrels per day in <A href=""http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=ch#pet"">refining capacity as of 2013</A>, the Chinese refining sector is second in size only to that of the United States. And the government’s 12th Five-Year Plan calls for the production of an additional 2 million refined barrels per day by 2015, with preliminary indications suggesting that <A href=""http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-109/issue-10/processing/special-report-capacity-complexity-expansions.html"">China may actually exceed those production targets</A> and could end up with more than it needs domestically. </P><P>China alone will account for about <A href=""http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-109/issue-10/processing/special-report-capacity-complexity-expansions.html"">40 percent of the global growth</A> in refining capacity in the next five years. Much of that added capacity will be used to satisfy growing demand coming from the East Asian region. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, China’s current production levels are <A href=""http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=ch"">insufficient to meet demand growth</A> there.</P><P>While China is catching up to the United States in total refining capacity, it continues to lag significantly behind in refining quality. Given the heavier and waxier nature of China’s domestic oils, Chinese refineries produce more low-value, high-<mark>carbon</mark> residual products (pet coke and bunker fuel) than high-value diesel and jet fuel (or, to use a term of art, they have a higher ratio of cracking to crude distillation units). </P><P>Some of the newest Chinese refineries are equipped to process a wide range of inputs, but China’s refining sector is skewed toward small refineries (producing less than 40,000 barrels per day) that were not designed to handle the more complex oils China aims to import. These so-called “teapot” or “teakettle” refineries account for nearly one-half of China’s total refining capacity, are primarily concentrated in Shandong Province, and are privately owned. They are also extremely energy intensive, inefficient, and polluting. The <A href=""http://www.chinaoiltrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/China-Oil-Trader-3_China-Independent-Refineries-Will-Influence-Crude-Oil-Products-and-Shipping-Markets_20120610.pdf"">NDRC pledged to close the teapots in 2012</A>, but local opposition has so far stymied the central government’s efforts. </P><P>As China is a net oil importer, there will be strong investment pressure for it to <A href=""http://www.eisourcebook.org/cms/Feb%202013/Pacific%20Basic%20Heavy%20Oil%20Refining%20Capacity.pdf"">process every possible type of crude oil inpu</A>t, but not necessarily optimally. Due to the high cost and long lifetimes of oil infrastructure, it will be important for China to take local <mark>pollution</mark> and <mark>climate change</mark> measures into account. Lighter oils will have fewer environmental downsides while yielding more diesel—the refined product with the highest demand growth in Asia. Heavier oils will have more environmental downsides that will require significant investment to mitigate. </P><P>Moreover, fostering sector-wide “lock-in” of dirtier petroleum products today will make it difficult and expensive to retrofit facilities in the future. China must carefully weigh <mark>climate change</mark> and other environmental implications of its oil policies. The types of oil, refining, and products China chooses to develop domestically, invest in abroad, and ultimately consume will shape the global oil sector and its worldwide impacts for decades to come.</P><H3>The Future Environmental Footprint</H3><P>It is difficult to overstate the impact of China’s rising demand for oil on <mark>climate change</mark>, air <mark>pollution</mark>, and quality of life. The <mark>carbon</mark> footprint left by oil—especially if China produces or imports heavy oils or extra-heavy oils—is significant. As China expands its oil consumption, foreign oil investment, and refining capacity, it will play a pivotal role in shaping what oil products will be sold on the world market, especially elsewhere in Asia. </P><P>Even with a slowdown in economic growth, China’s oil consumption continues to grow at about 5 percent per year. To satisfy that demand, China will have to work with dirty and difficult oils, which are often cheaper to buy but more damaging to use. Without new oil regulations that take <mark>climate change</mark> into consideration or a <mark>carbon</mark> price designed to take <mark>climate change</mark> into account, China’s growing oil demand may gravely jeopardize efforts to mitigate further <A href=""http://www.theoildrum.com/node/9608"">deterioration of air quality and <mark>climate change</mark></A>. </P><P>Another large environmental challenge facing China is water, which is essential for fracking and steam-assisted recovery of heavier oils. China’s first national “<A href=""http://chinawaterrisk.org/research-reports/report-of-the-first-national-water-census-on-<mark>pollution</mark>-sources-in-chinese-only/"">water census</A>,” undertaken in 2010, reveals a <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/23/us-<mark>climate</mark>-ipcc-china-idUSBRE98M0BP20130923"">serious national water shortage</A>. The development of unconventional oils will have to compete for these limited water resources with agricultural, industrial, and urban users. And the huge volumes of <A href=""http://carnegieendowment.org/2014/03/11/texas-s-oil-and-water-tightrope/h35x"">water produced in the fracking process</A> will make it more difficult for China to safely dispose of the contaminated water so that it doesn’t taint clean drinking water or induce earthquakes, as some disposal methods are thought to do.</P><P>There is a growing awareness among China’s leadership that something must be done to better manage the environment. Official state growth objectives intend to better balance energy demand, economic growth, and public health. At the March 2014 National People’s Congress, <A href=""http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/03/05/us-china-parliament-<mark>pollution</mark>-idUKBREA2405W20140305"">Premier Li Keqiang announced</A> in his work report that China will “resolutely declare war against <mark>pollution</mark> as we declared war against poverty.” The growing air and environmental <mark>pollution</mark> across China is “nature’s red-light warning against inefficient and blind development,” highlighting the need for China to not only reduce emissions but also shift to a more <mark>sustainable</mark> model of development. The NDRC proposed further limits on air and water <mark>pollution</mark> and greenhouse gas emissions. </P><P>But regulating industrial outputs will not be enough. If China developed those oils with the lowest <mark>climate</mark> impacts, it could reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and ensure that more problematic <mark>carbon</mark>-laden oils are left in the ground. The same prudent strategy should figure into choosing which overseas hydro<mark>carbon</mark> plays to invest in or take direct ownership of. In addition, the government must do more to promote demand reduction through greater <A href=""http://china.lbl.gov/publications/quantifying-potential-impact-energy-e"">energy efficiency</A>, <A href=""http://carnegietsinghua.org/2013/08/01/recharging-china-s-electric-vehicle-policy/gh3z"">vehicle electrification</A>, <A href=""http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-09-09/china-needs-beijing-to-be-even-bigger"">urbanization</A>, and expanded use of <A href=""http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Integration_of_Renewables.pdf"">renewables</A>. </P><H3>Geopolitical Implications</H3><P>As investors, the big three currently lack new significant domestic economic reserves, the latest technology, and the most innovative cost-saving practices of the Western supermajors. But they make up for that deficit with their sizeable clout and financial backing that often allows them to bundle oil agreements with development assistance. </P><P>China has been particularly interested in providing this “no strings attached” assistance to states that Western supermajors deem too risky. Chinese firms enjoy a comparative advantage in states where political drawbacks make Western investment unlikely.</P><P>China has formed close contractual relationships with national oil companies from Venezuela to Kazakhstan and has signed a number of controversial loans-for-oil deals with countries such as Iran and <A href=""http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article46333"">Sudan</A>. From Africa to Central Asia, Chinese investments have made the state’s goal of market diversification a reality and have given <A href=""http://carnegieendowment.org/2013/09/18/china-s-unmatched-influence-in-central-asia/gnky"">China unprecedented political leverage</A>.<SUP>3</SUP></P><P>While China has yet to displace other nations in terms of their geopolitical influence over global energy, security concerns have been raised regarding the political repercussions of some Chinese investments. China made oil investments in Sudan in the 2000s as violence raged in Darfur and has more recently invested in Iran. Both undertakings earned Beijing a substantial amount of negative publicity overseas. But Chinese doctrinal positions that hold state sovereignty and noninterference as virtually sacrosanct make it unlikely that China would completely sever oil ties with countries that face Western criticism over human rights abuses or other malfeasance. </P><P>In addition, Chinese oil firms are increasing their investments in some of the world’s heaviest oils without paying sufficient attention to <mark>climate</mark> considerations. Some believe that this practice will end up straining relations between the producing states and China due to growing public environmental concerns in the producing states. China could mitigate these escalating political risks by taking <mark>climate change</mark> considerations into account when pursuing overseas investments. </P><P>China also faces potential political blowback over how it handles possible oil exploration in waters of the East China and South China Seas. Many surrounding nations have territorial disputes in the waters off China that include oil reserves (see map). Although those resources are not considered recoverable today, they may become so in the future.</P><P>To date, China has given little indication of when or if its strategic thinking on energy security will shift. It is clearly reluctant to take on new political or security commitments, especially when other states—particularly the United States—continue to guarantee overall stability and access of oil to markets. However, oil relationships could shift. China’s economic importance to the Middle East is growing, and the country’s reliance on the region’s oil stands in stark contrast to U.S. “war weariness” after a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. The United States’ reduced dependence on Middle Eastern oil due to its growing domestic energy production could serve to reshape China’s future role in the region.</P><P>There are significant fears that exercising Chinese power overseas can stoke anti-Chinese sentiment and undermine China’s overall position in the world. But either by gradual evolution or by a sudden crisis, the Chinese leadership will likely be forced to play a more interventionist role in the future. A sudden crisis in one of China’s resource centers, as seen in South Sudan in 2012 or in Ethiopia in the 2000s, may compel Beijing to react. In the longer term, as China begins to commission a true blue-navy fleet, there will likely be calls from some segments of the military establishment to assume both symbolically and strategically a greater role in protecting energy shipping lanes in the Indian Ocean. </P><H3>China’s Role in Global Oil Development</H3><P>China’s oil consumption is rising just as the oil sector is experiencing a paradigm shift that is unlocking an assortment of expensive and complex unconventional oil sources. China is making massive investments to retrofit and expand the globalizing oil value chain, from extracting and transporting to refining and marketing new oils. </P><P>The capital infrastructure built today is expected to last well into the twenty-first century. As such, those financing today’s oil developments—from CNPC and Exxon to Dutch-owned Vitol and the American Carlyle Group—must take geopolitical and environmental considerations into account. The investments and new oils China pursues, both domestically and abroad, could have significant economic, environmental, and security implications. </P><P>To date, China has focused largely on joint investment projects with Western supermajors and on acquiring equity oil abroad to secure its oil imports despite a budding awareness of its <A href=""http://www.eia.gov/conference/2013/pdf/presentations/kuuskraa.pdf"">substantial domestic unconventional oil (and gas)</A> resources. This may well change in the years ahead. </P><P>A farsighted management strategy—one that accounts for the potential volatility of international oil markets and mounting externalities of <mark>climate change</mark>, air <mark>pollution</mark>, and water concerns—must guide China’s future oil decisions. If China’s economic growth is to follow a <mark>sustainable</mark> path, Beijing’s leadership will need to carefully steer oil supply and further reduce demand. The promise of stability will require a thoughtful oil policy to create a better future for China and the world.</P><H3>Notes</H3><P><SUP>1 </SUP>Sinochem Corporation is another Chinese oil conglomerate that is primarily engaged in the production and trading of petrochemicals. The big three could be expanded to include Sinochem, depending on the company’s future investments in oil exploration and production both domestically and abroad.</P><P><SUP>2 </SUP>Oil’s densities vary widely by oil type. Conventional oils range from 6.6 to 8 barrels per metric ton (1 metric ton = 1.1 ton) and extra-heavy oils/bitumen range from 5.8 to 6.4 barrels per metric ton.

Photo by The<mark>Climate</mark>Group/Flickr</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class=""field field--body""><P>As 2017 begins, China is poised to leap ahead of the United States on clean energy to become the most important player in the global market. Last year, China increased its foreign investment in renewables by 60 percent to reach a record $32 billion, according to <A href=""http://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Chinas-Global-Renewable-Energy-Expansion_January-2017.pdf"">a new report</A> from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. This includes 11 new overseas investment deals worth more than $1 billion each.</P><P>China’s new Going Global strategy for renewable energy was an important instigator of its huge increase in foreign investment in 2016. This is part of a broader picture of overseas investment. Last year, China showed its regional strength by establishing the Asia Infrastructure &amp; Investment Bank and pouring money into the BRICS’ New Development Bank, which made its <A href=""http://ndb.int/brics-bank-gives-811-million-in-first-round-green-energy-loans.php"">first loans</A>, all for renewable energy.</P><H3>Renewables on the Rise</H3><P>Looking at the entire economy, not just foreign investment, China regularly outspends the United States on renewable energy. It invested more than <A href=""https://www.bnef.com/dataview/clean-energy-investment/index.html"">$100 billion</A> in clean energy in 2015, more than double U.S. investment, which spurred robust job growth. Of the 8.1 million <A href=""http://www.irena.org/menu/index.aspx?mnu=Subcat&amp;PriMenuID=36&amp;CatID=141&amp;SubcatID=2729"">renewable energy jobs</A> that exist globally, 3.5 million are in China, compared to less than one million in the United States. And China’s National Energy Administration <A href=""http://news.trust.org/item/20170105061200-0lnvd/"">projects</A> that new investment from 2016 to 2020 will create 13 million jobs in the renewable energy sector.</P><P>Solar panels are the mainstay of China’s clean energy sector. <A href=""http://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Chinas-Global-Renewable-Energy-Expansion_January-2017.pdf"">Five of the six</A> largest solar module manufacturing firms globally are Chinese. Average solar panel costs in China have tumbled about <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-26/china-to-cut-solar-wind-power-prices-as-project-costs-fall"">30 percent</A> this year.</P><P>But it’s not just solar. China is also embracing more complex manufacturing like electric cars. It overtook the United States as the largest market for electric vehicles in 2015, with over <A href=""https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Global_EV_Outlook_2016.pdf"">200,000</A> new registrations. <A href=""http://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Chinas-Global-Renewable-Energy-Expansion_January-2017.pdf"">Two Chinese firms</A>, BYD and CATL, are challenging Tesla’s pre-eminence in the sector, and China’s Tainqi Lithium is now the world’s largest manufacturer of lithium ion, an important input for electric vehicle batteries.</P><P>Even with renewables on the rise, the percentage of coal in China’s energy mix remains quite high, contributing to <mark>climate change</mark> and choking smog in some of the largest Chinese cities. Electricity from coal often receives priority over renewable power, which means that some renewable energy capacity is being wasted. In the first half of 2016, 21 percent of wind power in China <A href=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.cspplaza.com/article-7705-1.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1483798850586000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzW14jGRw73RaCTf4i84r51SQZxw"">went wasted</A> and 12.1 percent of solar in northern China was curtailed.</P><P>The good news is that the government is aware of these problems and is working to address them. It recently <A href=""http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2017-01/05/content_5156795.htm"">set a target</A> to limit coal at 58 percent of its energy mix by 2020, down from <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-energy-idUSKBN14H1EG"">64 percent in 2015</A>, and is working to reduce wasted renewable energy (learn more about these efforts <A href=""http://www.wri.org/blog/2016/04/chinas-1-2-3-punch-tackle-wasted-renewable-energy"">here</A>).</P><P>Looking at China’s latest five-year economic plan it is <A href=""http://new<mark>climate</mark>economy.report/2016/a-roadmap-for-financing-<mark>sustainable</mark>-infrastructure/#section-3554-content-3573"">on pace to over-deliver</A> on its 2020 <mark>carbon</mark> intensity commitments. However, that’s not enough. All countries, including China, are falling short of the emissions cuts we need to avoid the most dangerous <mark>climate change</mark>. Everyone needs to go further.</P><P>Even though it is not going quite fast enough, China is heading in the right direction and is primed to become a clean energy superpower. By ramping up clean energy domestically, China is building the economies of scale it needs to export cost-competitive clean energy products and services abroad. The United States, on the other hand, could soon be moving in the opposite direction.</P><H3>Cooperation and Competition</H3><P>In the past, the U.S. has been quick to innovate and embrace new energy opportunities: it is a global leader in natural gas and was a pioneer of renewable energy technology. But as the clean energy market matures, the United States is ceding its leadership role to China. It’s time to catch up. U.S. states and cities are looking to a clean energy future. Public support is important at all levels, from investment in research and development to tax incentives for green investment. The rewards are immense, including new jobs and cheap, clean power. The U.S. solar industry is already creating jobs – well-paying, blue-collar construction and manufacturing jobs – <A href=""http://www.thesolarfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/TSF-2015-National-Solar-Jobs-Census.pdf"">12 times faster</A> than the overall economy.</P><P>It’s not all competition between the United States and China in the clean energy market. There is plenty of cooperation going on as well. These two giant economies are collaborating government-to-government with public-private partnerships, and many U.S. businesses are engaged with Chinese clean energy. For example, GE <A href=""http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2011-01/11/content_11825804.htm"">partnered</A> with State Grid Corp., one of China’s large electric utilities, to develop standards for smart grids in China. Goldwind, a Chinese wind turbine manufacturer, <A href=""http://www.goldwindglobal.com/web/news.do?action=detail&amp;id=201204160359131811"">developed and financed</A> a 20-megawatt wind farm in Montana, working with state representatives.</P><P>The United States is not out of the race yet, but if the trends continue, China will leave it behind. The U.S. economy stands to benefit from greater efforts. It cannot afford to miss the clean energy opportunity.  </P></DIV><DIV class=""field field--field-tags field--supplement""><LABEL class=""field__label"">Tags: </LABEL></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Petroleum is the devil’s excrement and dominates the province’s law and economy. </P><P>Oil, the world’s most volatile and faithless commodity, hasn’t been kind to the province. It once provided the Alberta state with 30 per cent of its revenue and an excuse to lower taxes to win votes. Since 2015 lower oil prices combined with embarrassingly low royalties have dropped that revenue share to a painful eight per cent. </P><P>The income gap has created a long-term fiscal crisis that Alberta’s previous Conservative governments ignored with a string of deficit budgets. Conservative leader Jim Prentice identified the fiscal problem to Albertans during the 2015 election campaign — “In terms of who is responsible, we all need only look in the mirror,” <A href=""https://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2015/05/04/Grim-Jim/"">he said</A>. The Conservatives lost.</P><P>Notley is now counting on anticipated revenue from an unbuilt pipeline to <A href=""https://globalnews.ca/news/4094386/alberta-budget-2018-trans-mountain-revenue/"">balance the province’s budget</A> within the next five years. How’s that for living beyond your means?</P><P>Oil, a political homogenizer, has constructed an Alberta First mentality as arrogant and thuggish as Russia’s petro-fuelled nationalism. </P><P>The resource industry brooks no critics and seemly commands every Alberta politician, regardless of ideology, like a robot. This explains why every Alberta leader sounds like a Saudi prince with one agenda — exporting more oil. </P><P>Yet Alberta’s current predicament, the overproduction of bitumen, has long been foretold. </P><P>A 2007 <A href=""http://www.andrewnikiforuk.com/Dirty_Oil_PDFs/BitumenPriceReview07.pdf"">Bitumen Price Review</A> warned Alberta’s government about “large dramatic price drops and recoveries” for bitumen. “Essentially there is a lack of adequate market access due to increasing production levels.” </P><P>Because bitumen isn’t being refined into higher value goods such as gasoline, the government is “absorbing a higher share of price risk” due to price volatility, the review noted.</P><P>The solutions — all rejected by the nation’s elites — include higher royalty rates, shutting in production or refining more bitumen at home. The Koch brothers, by the way, could give Alberta a few lessons on how to make a killing on <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS427145980520120510"">“garbage crude”</A> by upgrading and refining the stuff. </P><P>Notley, a classic petro politician, now represents the resource and resource developers instead of her citizens. Her government, which could introduce a sales tax but won’t, has no plan for the over-production crisis other than blaming B.C. </P><P>Given that the United Conservatives under Kenney appear poised to win Alberta’s next election, Notley hopes to hold onto power by sounding more petulant than Kenney. </P><P>In the process she has turned Kenney into a temporary socialist. The avowed free market man now <A href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/jason-kenney-kinder-morgan-1.4610740"">supports</A> state investment in a U.S. pipeline that the market considers too risky and uneconomic. </P><P>Let’s now deal with the “leftist” and “dangerous” government of Premier John Horgan. According to Alberta’s media, Horgan has challenged the rule of law and defied the Constitution by seeking advice on bitumen spills and supporting an entirely legitimate and ordinary challenge to a pipeline in the courts.  </P><P>But Horgan, a practitioner of retro politics, is no <mark>climate change</mark> leader, fossil fuel hater or Constitution breaker. Like the previous BC Liberal government, Horgan believes taxpayers should <A href=""http://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/b-c-announces-rebates-conditions-for-liquefied-natural-gas-projects"">subsidize</A> LNG projects with generous tax breaks and continue industrializing northeastern B.C. with a record amount of hydraulic fracturing. Nor does Horgan apparently care if LNG exports make provincial <mark>climate</mark> targets impossible to achieve. </P><P>Intensive fracking in B.C.’s Montney shale basin now extracts a good percentage of natural gas liquids needed by Alberta to dilute its bitumen so the junk heavy crude can be moved in a pipeline.   </P><P>Horgan’s opposition to the Kinder Morgan project hinges on his party’s minority status. He remains in power as long as the Green Party keeps him there, and the Greens don’t think uneconomic pipelines are a good way to fight <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>Horgan also knows that he can’t win the next election if he alienates voters in half a dozen NDP-held ridings along the pipeline route in the Lower Mainland by becoming a pipeline cheerleader. </P><P>Horgan is likely now hoping that the outcome of a Supreme Court of Canada case about jurisdiction over pipeline approvals will relieve him of any political responsibility. Burnaby hopes to <A href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/trans-mountain-bylaw-1.4595398"">challenge</A> a National Energy Board ruling that the pipeline company doesn’t have to comply with municipal law.</P><P>Meanwhile, in Ottawa Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has painted himself into a black corner of his own making.  </P><P>As a consequence the Janus-faced former drama teacher now lectures the great classroom of Canada that the project must go ahead because Canada can only fight <mark>climate change</mark> by building pipelines. </P><P>If we took Trudeau at his word and applied his morality to everyday life, we’d all smoke more to end lung cancer, eat more to end obesity and drink more to end alcoholism.</P><P>It is a convenient morality for a drama teacher who doesn’t know what drama he is in.  </P><P>Trudeau’s wacky defence of Kinder Morgan can be traced to a <A href=""http://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/the-inside-story-of-kinder-morgans-approval"">backroom deal</A> made with Notley on addressing <mark>climate change</mark>. She promised to consider supporting a national <mark>climate</mark> plan, but only if Trudeau gave her a pipeline — a  kind of <mark>carbon</mark> tit for tat. </P><P>To secure that deal Trudeau had to break another promise he made to British Columbians. During the election campaign he said the NEB hearings on the pipeline expansion, a process fraught with <A href=""http://www.robynallan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/05/Letter-to-Prime-Minister-Trudeau-Trans-Mountain-Process-October-24-2016.pdf"">scandal</A> and bias, would be redone. </P><P>Under the former Harper government, the national energy regulator refused to look at upstream impacts (emissions) and gave too little attention to downstream impacts such as tankers on the coast and industry’s inability to clean up ocean spills. (Trudeau has since promised a $1.5-billion ocean spill program — a taxpayer subsidy for Kinder Morgan — but only if the project goes ahead.)</P><P>Moreover the NEB accepted an economic report by a Kinder Morgan consultant criticized as “without merit” by economist Robyn Allan. The report falsely claimed the pipeline would raise all oil prices in Canada — and didn’t explain how higher oil prices would actually benefit Canadians. </P><P>And in the middle of the hearings the Harper government <A href=""https://www.nationalobserver.com/2015/08/21/news/neb-delays-kinder-morgan-pipeline-hearing-following-outcry"">appointed</A> a Kinder Morgan consultant to the NEB. </P><P>Trudeau won the federal election, in part, by promising to address these travesties. He didn’t.</P><P>As a result nearly 300 anti-pipeline protesters have been arrested to date. Thousands more are prepared to defend the citizens of Burnaby, orcas, property values, truth, freedom, water and salmon. First Nations are leading this fight and another <A href=""http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/oka-crisis/"">Oka</A> is in the making.  </P><P>Trudeau’s cozy relationship with the authoritarian Chinese government has made his pipeline corner smaller.  </P><P>Han Jun, China’s vice-minister of financial and economic affairs, said in 2016 that the world’s second-largest economy would sign a free trade agreement with Canada — but only if Canada <A href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/china-open-to-historic-free-trade-deal-with-canada-under-certain-provisos/article28208595/"">built a pipeline</A> to the West Coast. </P><P>Much has been written about Notley’s feeble attempt <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-26/one-of-world-s-dirtiest-oil-sources-wants-to-be-green-but-how"">to recognize</A>the threat of <mark>climate change</mark> by introducing a <mark>carbon</mark> tax, setting a generous limit on oilsands emissions’ growth and reducing coal-fired power. </P><P>But as critics have <A href=""http://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/urquhart-albertas-<mark>climate</mark>-change-claims-ring-hollow"">noted</A> recently the plan is pretty much a grand case of green washing. Increased bitumen exports will simply take the place of reduced emissions from phasing out coal power. </P><P>Meanwhile a U.S. company, the bastard child of <A href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/ben-west/enron-kinder-morgan_b_3908063.html"">Enron</A>, has become a symbol of the national interest. </P><P>That version of the national interest is tied to a big lie still being repeated by politicians of all stripes. They falsely claim that the pipeline will secure higher prices for bitumen in Asian markets. </P><P>A recent <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-oil-pricing/table-mexicos-pemex-sets-april-maya-price-for-international-buyers-idUSL2N1GL22G"">story</A> in Reuters sets the record straight on this falsehood.</P><P>The global market sets discounts and premiums on types of oil based on quality. Mexican Maya crude — a product as junky as heavy bitumen — sold at a $6.15 discount to customers on the U.S. Gulf Coast, and a $9.40 discount to customers in Asia.</P><ASIDE class=""aside "" data-dev-object-descrip=""01-molecules/blocks/aside"" data-dev-status=""IN-PROGRESS""><DIV class=""related-story accent-color--border"" data-dev-object-descrip=""01-molecules/blocks/related-story"" data-dev-status=""IN-PROGRESS""><DIV class=""story-item ""><DIV class=""story-item__description""><H5>Death of Kinder Morgan Project a Campaign Promise, Premier Says</H5><A href=""/News/2018/04/10/Death-Kinder-Morgan-Campaign-Promise/"" class=""read-more link-wrap--contained-link"">	read more

Tony attended the recent ADB-China Datang Corporation CCS Workshop and <mark>Carbon</mark> Capture Forum, presenting alongside China’s Ministry of Science and Technology, Huaneng Group, PetroChina, Sinopec and a number of universities and international companies. The following Insight outline's the Datang CCS Workshop and the MOST <mark>Carbon</mark> Capture Forum held during the event. </EM></P><H2>Datang CCS Workshop</H2><P>On 30 March 2015, I attended the ADB-China Datang Corporation CCS workshop, held in Beijing, China. My time at the event clearly demonstrated that <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage (CCS) remains an important research priority in China, particularly as the rapidly growing demand for energy continues to impact on air quality and <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. The workshop marks the conclusion of a technical assistance project co-funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Global CCS Institute. In attendance were representatives from Asian Development Bank (ADB), the British Embassy, Canadian Embassy, corporations and academic institutions.</P><P>An interesting presentation came from the Datang Corporation which has constructed and operated the world’s first <mark>carbon</mark> capture pilot plant for a natural-gas fired power station at their Combined Heat and Power plant located in Gaojing. The four year old project captures around 10 tonnes per day (tpd) <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) from the station exhaust gas. The capture process is solvent-based and two types of solvent were used: modified MEA and ionic liquids. The flue gas contains around 4.6% CO<SUB>2</SUB> by volume. Due to the very low concentration of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, the energy penalty is around 4.36 GJ/t CO<SUB>2</SUB> captured.</P><P><EM>A model of the Datang <mark>carbon</mark> capture pilot plant</EM></P><P>This project is a milestone for <mark>carbon</mark> capture in natural gas power stations. The experiences and lessons learned will benefit other projects around the world. For Datang Corporation, this has become a very valuable platform for multiple purposes including:</P><UL><LI>demonstration of Datang’s commitment to low emission energy technology</LI><LI>a training platform for Datang personnel</LI><LI>a testing platform for CCS technology developers</LI><LI>a learning platform for Datang management</LI><LI>cultural transformation within the corporation</LI></UL><P>The power industry has its own unique culture and traditions for project management and O&amp;M guidelines. In contrast, <mark>carbon</mark> capture is in essence a chemical engineering process. During project implementation cultural collisions are often inevitable for project managers with electrical engineering backgrounds. This project has achieved significant organisational learnings for Datang Corporation. It has clearly improved awareness of emission reduction and the importance of CCS within Datang Corporation and in China. This learning was further evidenced in my discussions with Datang's senior management who reported many insights about CCS from the project.</P><P> </P><P><EM>Picture from the operational Datang pilot project</EM></P><H2>MOST <mark>Carbon</mark> Capture Forum</H2><P>On 31 March 2015, China Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) held a <mark>carbon</mark> capture forum in Beijing. The international forum was organised by China CCUS Alliance and the Institute. It was very well attended by people from China, North America, Europe and Australia. The Forum was chaired by Dr XU Shisen, President of Huaneng Clean Energy Research Institute (CERI).</P><H2>Support for CCS in China</H2><P>A senior official from MOST delivered the opening speech in which he summarised some major breakthrough CCUS projects in China. Two important factors for CCS development in China were highlighted:</P><OL><LI>The Chinese government has established policy to promote creation and <mark>innovation</mark>, “Made by China 2025”</LI><LI>The upcoming Paris Conference of the Parties (COP21) would likely achieve specific emission reduction targets for the world</LI></OL><P>Three expectations were raised:</P><OL><LI>Perform more in-depth investigations of CCS technology development trend and learn from others’ experiences and lessons.</LI><LI>Investigate how to promote creation-driven CCS development and how to apply CCS technology and to cultivate economic growth and explore new business models.</LI><LI>Strengthen international collaborations by incorporating discussions focused on commercial collaborations.</LI></OL><P>This speech clearly demonstrates the support for CCS technology development and commercialisation in China.</P><H2>Commercial CCS must be ready by 2030</H2><P>Dr Xu from CERI presented first. He mentioned that CCS has been cited in many national policies on <mark>climate change</mark> and energy. To meet expectations and <mark>climate change</mark> targets, the industry must be ready for deployment by 2030. He further emphasised that policy support and flexible financial tools are needed for deployment of CCS.</P><P>I was the second to present and shared my thoughts on <mark>carbon</mark> capture technology development. It is always good to see people in audience nodding during your speech. The focus of my presentation was CCS technology development, including:</P><UL><LI>An update on <mark>carbon</mark> capture technology development,</LI><LI>Comparative analysis for <mark>carbon</mark> capture cost reduction curve, and</LI><LI>Promising areas for next generation <mark>carbon</mark> capture technologies.</LI></UL><H2>New U.S.-China CCS partnerships</H2><P>A US Department of Energy (DOE) representative spoke after me and discussed the US programs. More importantly, it was revealed that during the Chinese president’s state visit to the US this September, an announcement will be made regarding four CCUS projects - two for each country. At least one of these will focus on CO<SUB>2</SUB>-EOR (enhanced oil recovery) and CO<SUB>2</SUB>-EWR (enhanced water recovery). The two governments are in discussions regarding the details of such projects.</P><P>After that, a variety of speakers presented including those from Huaneng Group, PetroChina, Shell, Siemens, Sinopec, CSIRO, Tsinghua University, Huazhong University of Science and Technology on various technologies for <mark>carbon</mark> capture. It was great to see the strong industry engagement and support of CCS technology.</P><P>During the panel discussion, Dr Xu asked me questions regarding the Institute’s role in China. He recommended that the Institute should not only bring knowledge into China but also promote China’s CCS expertise on the global stage. It was a great request and question to receive and the Institute is indeed planning to do more work in China, together with the Chinese government, industries and research community.</P><H2>CCS investment in China expected to rise</H2><P>Mr Kang from MOST concluded the Forum with a very informative and encouraging speech. The Chinese government invested RMB 600-700 million for CCS R&amp;D during the 12th Five-Year Plan with an industry matching fund of around two billion. For the 13th Five-Year Plan, more investments for CCS technology development are likely to be made by the government and industries.</P><P>The discussions during the Forum demonstrate China’s understanding of the role for CCS in emissions reduction and commitment to CCS technology development and deployment. The implementation of a national <mark>carbon</mark> trading scheme in 2016 would further improve the awareness of the need for emissions reduction among the wider community and within the government. Such a trading scheme would also be likely to accommodate CCS and to provide additional incentives for CCS deployment to enable CCS to compete alongside other energy technologies such as renewables.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Will PetroChina be able to deliver?</P></DIV></HEADER><DIV class=""submission__content entry-content""><P>China has fueled its country’s growth with coal to become the world’s second-largest economy and largest energy consumer<SUP>1</SUP><EM>. </EM>While coal has improved living standards for China’s citizens, declining air quality has resulted in significant health and environmental concerns. The 2010 Global Burden of Disease study estimated that poor air quality led to 1.2MM premature deaths and $230B (3.5% of GDP) of environmental degradation in China<SUP>2</SUP>. In 2015, 63% of all days were classified as unhealthy or worse levels for particulate pollutants<SUP>3</SUP>. Due to increasing pressures from its citizens and world agencies, China has vowed to improve its air quality and signed the Paris Agreement.</P><P>The Agreement, negotiated by 195 countries in 2015, is an action plan to keep global warming below 2°C above pre-industrial levels<SUP>4</SUP>. In its 13<SUP>th</SUP> Five-Year Plan, China stated it will begin to replace coal in non-power sectors with natural gas and electricity. The plan calls for natural gas to make up 10% of total energy use by 2020, up from 6% today (and hopes to reduce coal from 62% to 50% by 2030)<SUP>5</SUP>. The rationale for the switch is that natural gas produces approximately half as much <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide per unit of energy as does coal<SUP>6</SUP>. This plan requires massive changes to China’s domestic energy infrastructure. However, China has shown over the past few years that it has an inability to meet its domestic natural gas demand.</P><P>Who will provide this natural gas? PetroChina (NYS: PTR) is the likely candidate, despite its current lack of expertise in shale gas drilling. The company’s reserves have historically been heavily weighted to giant, mature, conventional oil reserves in domestic and international locations. Despite the obvious opportunity before PetroChina, whose parent is national oil company CNPC, the company must make significant organizational and structural changes to adapt to drilling unconventional shale gas.</P><P>China has the largest shale gas potential in the world (1,115 Tcf), or 1.7x larger than United States’, but has only developed a fraction of the reserves<SUP>7</SUP>. PetroChina has taken steps to position itself as the premier domestic producer by investing in joint ventures in the United States to learn drilling technology applications from American companies. In 2011 it partnered with Shell, who promised to invest $1B in China’s shale plays annually<SUP>8</SUP>.  The primary shale basin in Sichuan is remote, densely populated with tightly packed farms, and has poor infrastructure. The gas is trapped in deep, complex geographical formations and is difficult to extract. Additionally, bureaucratic delays resulted in a one year delay in contract approval. These factors resulted in elevated costs of ~$14.5MM per well in 2013 and $10.5MM per well in 2015<SUP>9</SUP>. While costs declined over that time frame, they were still substantially higher than the ~$4MM per well cost of drilling in the United States. Accordingly, Shell rescinded its investment and left China due to the myriad of political and logistical problems outlined above.</P><P>Beyond the costs, China’s workers are generally inexperienced in shale drilling and contractors have not been trained in modern safety standards. The drilling process is water intensive, requiring rig sites to share water sources with local farmers. Temporary PVC pipes transporting fresh and chemical-filled waste water have ruptured causing spills that have leaked into farmland and local rivers<SUP>10</SUP>. With the shale gas located in China’s breadbasket, spills could endanger the country’s food source.</P><P>An additional future threat is global warming itself. The region’s droughts and storms will likely become much more severe due to <mark>climate change</mark>. PetroChina’s history is checkered with spills and environmental standard violations<SUP>11</SUP>. It is imperative that the company address these concerns to be a part of China’s <mark>climate</mark> solution, rather than exacerbating the problem.</P><P><STRONG>Steps for the Future</STRONG></P><P>In order to reduce costs and limit future environmental problems, PetroChina should execute the following initiatives:</P><UL><LI>Establish permanent infrastructure, including roads, power sources, and pipelines to carry hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s to market.</LI><LI>Develop fully enclosed containment systems for wastewater and hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s that can withstand earthquakes, utility outages, and untreated flood runoff.</LI><LI>Train workers in modern environmental and safety standards for emergency situations.</LI><LI>Redefine floodplains to account for sediment erosion and storms.</LI><LI>Secure deep table water sources away from farmland and implement waste water disposal and recycling best practices.</LI><LI>Explore shale plays outside of China’s breadbasket. With <mark>climate change</mark> negatively impacting farmland and food supplies, PetroChina must preemptively minimize the possibility of an environmental disaster impacting food distribution channels.</LI></UL><P>It is imperative that China uses its shale gas as a bridge fuel to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions until renewable resources are readily available. PetroChina is best positioned to supply the country with natural gas, but must improve its processes to reduce costs and mitigate potential environmental disasters.</P><P>(774 words.)</P><P>Sources:</P><OL><LI>Hirst, T.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration is expecting the United States to become a net exporter of natural gas soon. This all bodes well for the Donald J.

U.S. policy makers need to recognize this risk and take steps to mitigate it. As I explain in <A href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-02-13/green-giant"" title=""my latest article"" target=""_blank"">my latest article</A> in <EM>Foreign Affairs</EM>, it is in the vital U.S. interest to remain in the Paris accord.</P><P>China is banking on clean energy technologies as major industrial exports that will compete with U.S. and Russian oil and gas and make China the renewable energy and electric vehicle superpower of a future energy world.

            Angola) has supplied approximately 40% of China's oil imports during 
            recent years. Sudan's share in those imports from Africa has fallen 
            substantially - from a little more than 35% in 2001 to about 10% in 
            2006.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Through companies 
            which it controls, particularly <A href=""http://acir.yale.edu/ACIRReport.pdf"">Petrochina</A> 
            (a subsidiary of <A href=""http://www.cnpc.com.cn/eng/cnpcworldwide/africa/Sudan/"">China 
            National Petroleum Corporation</A>) the government of China is fuelling 
            (<I>sic</I>) genocide in Darfur, Sudan. Due to their joint ventures 
            with the China National Petroleum Corporation group, foreign oil companies 
            are complicit by association with that genocide and some might even 
            be using this &quot;conflict oil&quot; or &quot;blood oil&quot; in 
            the products which their facilities in China refine and which are 
            subsequently sold to unsuspecting consumers.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">China Petroleum 
            and Chemical Corporation (&quot;Sinopec&quot;; controlled by the government 
            of China) accounted for just over 70% (<A href=""http://english.sinopec.com/en-business/955.shtml"">US$34 
            billion</A>) of the declared import value of China's crude oil imports 
            during 2005. </FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">China National 
            Petroleum Corporation appears to conduct much of its business in impoverished 
            countries in association with Petronas (controlled by the government 
            of Malaysia) - e.g. in conflict-torn Chad and Sudan. Companies in 
            China and Malaysia appear to co-operate in impoverished countries 
            also in the timber industry (notably through the notorious Rimbunan 
            Hijau group which has close links to Fujian Province). This damages 
            Malaysia's public image.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">China is the destination 
            for most of Sudan's crude oil exports - Sudan's principal source of 
            hard currency. The Sudanese government is understood to be supporting 
            genocide in Darfur - where <A href=""http://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/sudan1103/2.htm"">China 
            has major oil interests</A>. The &quot;international community&quot; 
            appears to condone this genocide - having shied away from imposing 
            selected trade sanctions on Sudan - the feeble, but often cited, reason 
            being that China would veto a prohibition against the import of Sudanese 
            crude oil.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">If there were 
            a free market in crude oil - and importing countries (/their oil industry 
            and &quot;defence&quot; contractors) had not bilaterally negotiated 
            imports (/payment) from producer countries at substantially below 
            market price (thereby denying the producer countries large sums of 
            hard currency - with which to reduce their international debt and 
            improve the quality of life of their populations) - China would readily 
            switch between sources of supply.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""> Vetoing UN trade 
            sanctions on the Sudan's exports of crude oil would indicate not only 
            that China assigns greater weight to lucrative supplies of crude oil 
            than it does to efforts to halt government sponsored genocide (China's 
            attitude to ethnic minorities is well known) but that China is paying 
            the Sudan well below the market price for this high value commodity 
            and that the impoverished Sudanese people are subsidising China's 
            rapidly increasing contribution to <A href=""G8IllegalTimber.htm""><mark>climate</mark> 
            change</A>. Consumer reaction to China's veto would be swift - and 
            a veto would jeopardise sponsorship of the 2008 Olympic Games.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Indeed, China 
            appears to have chosen a &quot;development&quot; path which maximises 
            <mark>pollution</mark> and <mark>climate change</mark>. Indeed, China prefers to invest in US 
            Treasury Bonds than in clean coal technology. China's disrespect for 
            intellectual property rights is a major disincentive for those who 
            wish to increase the market for alternative energy generating (or 
            energy saving) technologies, and a primary reason why China is not 
            already a world leader in such technologies. China's credibility is 
            fundamentally weakened, and the power of Big Oil is strengthened, 
            as a consequence.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Perhaps the most 
            satisfactory lever of change in this respect would be for the <mark>pollution</mark>-footprint 
            of a product's supply chain (transport and manufacture) to be taken 
            into account by prospective purchasers. For example, the export of 
            &quot;dirty&quot; paper made in China - paper production is particularly 
            energy intensive (China's <A href=""http://www.total.com/energies/N9/en/dossier/details/dossier04.htm"">coal 
            fired</A> power stations have for many years been amongst the greatest 
            contributors to <mark>climate change</mark> and the sulphurous haze which covers 
            much of China). Further, there is concern about the fraudulent financing 
            of some of China's leading paper mills (notably <A href=""http://chinamatters.blogspot.com/2007/04/chinas-export-driven-economy-is-party.html"">Asia Pulp and Paper</A>) 
            and the illegality of the pulpwood from which their paper is made.</FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Files</SPAN></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></DIV></DIV><P>High-emission industries such as aluminum and steel are likely to resist higher costs as they are already battling weak prices due to tepid demand and a persistent supply gut. </P><P>“It is a very big concern for Beijing and for local governments - how to strike a balance between controlling emissions and maintaining economic growth especially amid a general slowdown in the economy,” said Shawn He, lawyer and <mark>carbon</mark> specialist at the Hualian legal practice in Beijing. </P><P>While the exchange in the southern city of Shenzhen will not immediately lead to a big cut in China’s emissions of <mark>climate</mark>-changing greenhouse gas, now the world’s highest, it does still represent a statement of intent by Beijing, campaigners said. </P><P>“This is just a baby step when you look at the total quantity of emissions, but it enables China to establish institutions for <mark>carbon</mark> controls for the first time,” said Li Yan, head of environmental group Greenpeace’s <mark>climate</mark> and energy campaign in China. </P><P>State oil giant PetroChina and private power generator Hanergy conducted the first two trades on the Shenzhen exchange, buying <mark>CO2</mark> permits for 28 yuan ($4.57) and 30 Yuan per metric ton respectively, Thomson Reuters Point <mark>Carbon</mark> reported. </P><P>That is around three quarters prices on Europe’s Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Front-year EU Allowance futures, trading on ICE Futures Europe, ended Monday down 4.8 percent at 4.54 euros ($6.06). </P><P>Under a cap-and-trade scheme, companies must buy allowances from others if they want to exceed <mark>carbon</mark> limits. But there is still a long way to go in China, and the design of its pilot platforms - as well as the national scheme that would eventually replace them - face economic and social pressures. </P><P>“Of course, decision makers have to look at the social impact - the <mark>carbon</mark> market cannot be designed in an idealistic way and you have to make sure the design of the mechanism will address such issues as social stability,” said Wu Changhua, China director with the London-based <mark>Climate</mark> Group consultancy. </P><P>And the example of <mark>carbon</mark> markets overseas is not encouraging, with the global financial crisis saddling the ETS in Europe with a crushing oversupply of <mark>carbon</mark> credits and record low prices. </P><P>The Shenzhen exchange is one of seven pilot schemes due to be launched this year or next, and will involve 635 local industrial enterprises accounting for more than a quarter of local GDP and more than 30 million metric tons (33.07 million tons) of <mark>CO2</mark> emissions. But that is still a drop in the ocean compared to the country’s total emissions of around 8 billion metric tons last year </P><P>Other platforms due to start in 2013 include one in the business hub of Shanghai, where leading steel mill Baoshan Iron and Steel will participate, and Hubei province, home of Wuhan Iron and Steel. </P><H3>INDUSTRIAL IMPACT </H3><P>While giant oil firms like PetroChina and CNOOC are taking part in the Shenzhen scheme, few of the companies involved will be from bloated but <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive heavy industrial sectors such as steel or aluminum, and figuring out how to include them is likely to be a bigger challenge. </P><P>Late last year, China’s industry ministry told firms in sectors like steel to reduce their 2010 <mark>carbon</mark> intensity rates - the volume of <mark>CO2</mark> produced per unit of output - by 18 percent by 2015. That was a massive burden for a sector already bruised by rising input costs and minimal returns, with the country’s economy growing at its slowest pace for 13 years in 2012 and data so far this year surprising on the downside. </P><P>But while it will add to the costs of struggling firms, it could also give Beijing another tool to bring wayward industries in line with state policies and force polluting firms to close. </P><P><mark>Carbon</mark> trade will give local governments an alternative source of revenue as well as an incentive to free up some of their <mark>CO2</mark> allocations by closing small steel mills. </P><P>Jiang Feitao, a researcher at the China Academy of Social Sciences who has studied the impact of environmental policy on the steel sector, said smaller companies would be hit hardest by costs. </P><H3>NATIONAL TRADE </H3><P>After Shenzhen, Shanghai and Hubei, four more pilot exchanges are due to open in the capital Beijing, the sprawling industrial municipalities of Tianjin and Chongqing, and the manufacturing center of Guangdong province on the southeast coast, probably next year. </P><P>The National Development and Reform Commission said the seven pilot schemes will begin a process of integration in 2015 and that a nationwide platform will go into operation some time before 2020. But the seven regions were given considerable leeway to design their own schemes and it remains unclear how they will connect together. </P><P>“My guess at this moment is that they will set up a national platform and gradually integrate the seven pilot schemes into that one, but we don’t know the architecture yet - this is very new,” said <mark>Climate</mark> Group’s Wu. </P><P>He, the lawyer, said China still needed legislation to give legal recognition to the concept of <mark>carbon</mark> trading. It also needed to solve the longstanding problem of measuring emissions. </P><P>“I don’t think it is possible to get to a national market by 2015 - there are many technical issues to be addressed to integrate these islands into one continent,” He said. </P><P>China also eventually needs to set a national limit on emissions and allocate this to individual industries and provinces to establish a full countrywide trading scheme. </P><P>“Realistically, we are looking at 2025 before we have a cap - a few years ago some were saying 2040 or 2035 so we have already made progress,” said Wu. </P><P>“Growth will continue to be the No.1 priority. Cap-and-trade will be one of the ways of trying to grow differently, but China is still a developing country and we have to grow.”</P><DIV class=""container_28wm1""><DIV class=""attribution_o4ojT""><P class=""content_27_rw"">Editing by Joseph Radford</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

(PetroChina) whereby PetroChina will acquire an interest in two Western Australia exploration assets and establish a Joint Study Agreement (JSA) for unconventional resource development in Sichuan Basin in China. </P><P>Under these agreements, which still require government and partner approvals, PetroChina will acquire a working interest in the Poseidon offshore discovery in the Browse Basin, and in the Goldwyer Shale in the onshore Canning Basin. In addition, ConocoPhillips will enter into a Joint Study Agreement to identify unconventional resource reserves in the Neijiang-Dazu Block in China’s Sichuan Basin.</P><P>“ConocoPhillips is pleased that PetroChina has recognized the significant resource potential and value of the Australian opportunities. Likewise, ConocoPhillips recognizes the Sichuan Basin as having some of the most prospective marine shales in China and looks forward to working with one of the world’s leading energy companies,” said Don Wallette, executive vice president, Commercial, Business Development and Corporate Planning, ConocoPhillips. “The signing of these three agreements marks a significant step toward increased global collaboration between our companies.”</P><P>Under the terms of the agreement with ConocoPhillips, PetroChina will acquire working interest in the two Australian projects; specifically 20 percent of Poseidon in the Browse Basin and 29 percent of Goldwyer in the Canning Basin.</P><P>Under the JSA, ConocoPhillips and PetroChina will study the potential for unconventional resource development in the approximately 500,000 acre Neijiang-Dazu Shale Block in the Sichuan Basin. The joint study will be an important step in evaluating the potential for unconventional resource exploration in the area. If technically and commercially viable, the companies will advance development under a production sharing contract, which would be agreed upon during the study period.</P><P>Todd Creeger, President, ConocoPhillips Australia-West said the agreement with PetroChina was significant for the company’s growth plans in both China and Australia. “We welcome PetroChina as a new joint venture participant in our Australian offshore and onshore exploration projects. We look forward to jointly delivering two successful assets,” Creeger said.</P><P>Jim Taylor, President, ConocoPhillips China stated, “This is a great opportunity for ConocoPhillips to cooperate with PetroChina in order to study the potential for unconventional resource development here in China. We believe that the cooperation between the two companies will form an important driver in promoting clean energy supply to China and contributing to the country’s transition into a clean energy economy.”</P><P align=""center"">--- # # # ---</P><P><STRONG>About ConocoPhillips</STRONG></P><P>Headquartered in Houston, Texas, ConocoPhillips had operations and activities in 30 countries, $58 billion in annual revenue, $117 billion of total assets and approximately 16,900 employees as of Dec. 31, 2012.

The ramifications of the dollar-denominated oil trade are immense: Because oil is priced in dollars, there is huge demand for dollars, lending the U.S. economic and strategic power.  </P><P>Beijing hopes to challenge the dollar by setting up a futures market with its own currency, the yuan. To that end, <A href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/petro-yuan-china-wants-to-dethrone-dollar-rmb-denominated-oil-contracts.html"">reports</A> indicate that China is set to introduce an oil benchmark priced in yuan in the coming months.</P><P>For China, there are a lot of upsides to this gambit. An oil futures market based in yuan will stimulate demand for the Chinese currency, which China believes will lend it strategic clout. That money is also more likely to be recycled back into the Chinese economy. The U.S. has been able to run huge budget deficits, borrowing money at extremely low rates because of the demand for its currency. Petrodollars continuously flow back into the U.S. economy, creating investment and economic growth that might not otherwise occur. The dollar has also long been one of the premier safe havens for investors around the world.</P><P>China hopes to replicate this dynamic. And as the largest oil importer in the world, there is a great deal of logic in having oil contracts trade in yuan.</P><P><SPAN style=""color: #800000;""><STRONG class=""related""><A href=""https://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Renewable-Energy/The-Impact-Of-EVs-On-Commodities-In-One-Chart.html"">Related: The Impact Of EVs On Commodities In One Chart</A></STRONG></SPAN></P><P>But it won’t be easy to unseat the greenback. The plan is to launch an oil futures contract on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), but there are obstacles in convincing large oil producers and consumers in using the yuan and investing in the Shanghai benchmark. Without some major countries participating, like, say, Saudi Arabia or Russia, it will be difficult to create a market that is deep and liquid enough to make a difference.</P><P>Moreover, because the yuan does not float freely – it is fixed to the dollar and adjusted daily – major investors will be wary of trading in the Chinese currency. &quot;My biggest reservations are the role of the Chinese central government, potential state intervention and favoritism toward Chinese companies,&quot; said John Driscoll, director of JTD Energy Services, according to CNBC. On the other hand, China has slowly loosened its grip on its currency.</P><P>&quot;Game changer it is not — at least not yet,&quot; Gal Luft, co-director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, told <A href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/petro-yuan-china-wants-to-dethrone-dollar-rmb-denominated-oil-contracts.html"">CNBC</A>. &quot;But it is another indicator of the beginning of the glacial, and I emphasize the word glacial, decline of the dollar.&quot;</P><P>Others see much more dramatic change coming from the launching of the Shanghai benchmark. Juerg Kiener, managing director and chief investment officer of asset manager Swiss Asia Capital, told CNBC that the petro-yuan is “well-advanced” and already “structurally in place.”</P><P>Up until now, there have been some transactions in yuan, but only in trade specifically with China, and typically only with some smaller countries. Iran in particular was an early adopter of yuan-based oil sales, an unsurprising fact given Tehran’s eagerness to avoid the long arm of the U.S. Treasury department.</P><P>A more significant development was Russia agreeing to some yuan-based oil trade in 2015, also the result of U.S. sanctions.</P><P><SPAN style=""color: #800000;""><STRONG class=""related""><A href=""https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Which-Of-These-3-Hotspots-Will-Be-The-Next-Big-Thing-In-Oil.html"">Related: Which Of These 3 Hotspots Will Be The Next Big Thing In Oil?</A></STRONG></SPAN></P><P>Many believe that key to the success of the benchmark is convincing a country like Saudi Arabia to participate. Saudi Arabia is one of the largest oil producers in the world, and sells a little more than 1 million barrels of oil each day to China. Russia is still the <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-trade-oil/russia-holds-spot-as-chinas-top-oil-supplier-for-seventh-month-customs-idUSKBN1CT0XC"">top supplier</A> to China, exporting 1.545 mb/d in September, and in fact, Russia has been taking market share away from Saudi Arabia in China. If Riyadh wants to avoid losing more ground, the thinking goes, it may need to agree to yuan-denominated sales. Recent reports that China’s large state-owned oil companies are considering an outright purchase of 5 percent of Saudi Aramco, a move that Saudi Arabia is rumored to be considering in lieu of the Aramco IPO, should be seen in this context.</P><P>&quot;I believe that yuan pricing of oil is coming and as soon as the Saudis move to accept it — as the Chinese will compel them to do — then the rest of the oil market will move along with them,” Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said on <A href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/11/china-will-compel-saudi-arabia-to-trade-oil-in-yuan--and-thats-going-to-affect-the-us-dollar.html"">CNBC</A> earlier this month.</P><P>At that point, things would really start to change, and the dollar would start to lose its top status. Some see that as unlikely, as Saudi Arabia would likely be <A href=""https://asia.nikkei.com/Markets/Commodities/China-sees-new-world-order-with-oil-benchmark-backed-by-gold?page=2"">met with blowback</A> from the U.S. But it would be a difficult choice for Riyadh – lose the Chinese market or spark the ire of Washington.</P><P>It may not happen right away, but the launching of the crude oil benchmark on the Shanghai exchange could mark the beginning of the end of the petrodollar.</P><P>By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.com</P><P><STRONG>More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:</STRONG></P></DIV></PICTURE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

For each day in 2016, China consumed 11.5 million barrels of oil, over a half million barrel increase from 2015, according to the annual report released by China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Association (CPCIA). With a domestic production of around 4 million barrels per day, China relies heavily on the international market for its oil supply. Statistics from Chinese Customs indicate that China imported 7.59 million barrels of crude oil per day in 2016, an increase of 13.6 percent over the previous year. China’s reliance on oil importation exceeded 65.6 percent. It is predicted that China’s consumption of crude oil by the year 2020 will be 12 million barrels a day, and by 2030, 80 percent of China’s crude oil supply will be imported.Natural gas is China’s fastest growing major fuel, with demand quadrupling in the past decade. Natural gas now accounts for 6 percent of China’s energy demand, double the market share in 2007. In 2016, China’s consumption of natural gas grew by 6.4 percent, reaching 224 billion cubic meters. China’s domestic gas production in 2016 was 150 billion cubic meters, up by 2.2%, and China’s gas imports increased 22 percent to reach 75 billion cubic meters.  This indicates there was a slight oversupply of gas in China last year. However, as China is moving forward with its plan to replace coal with cleaner and more efficient natural gas in power generation, the demand for gas will increase steadily in the long-run. The Chinese government expects gas to provide 10 percent of the country’s energy by the end of the 13<SUP>th</SUP> Five-year Plan period (2016-2020).China’s oil and gas markets are dominated by four national and provincial oil companies: PetroChina, Sinopec, China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and Yanchang Petroleum (a Shaanxi Provincial-level state-owned company). Sinopec controls 46 percent of total crude refining capacity, while PetroChina accounts for 31 percent. The remainder is processed by smaller refineries. CNOOC focuses on offshore oil development and has limited refining capacity.In the field of equipment manufacturing, Chinese domestic companies are dominating the market, in particular the lower end market. China’s State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) control approximately 66 percent of the market for well-drilling equipment. Small- and medium-sized private Chinese companies make-up 19 percent of the market. Foreign companies make up 10 percent of the market and supply advanced complete-set equipment. Chinese privately owned oil and gas equipment companies are catching up quickly. Among them, Sichuan-based HongHua Group and Shandong-based Jereh Group and Kerui Group are among the leading suppliers of such equipment.As global oil prices continue to stay at a level below $50/per barrel, Chinese oil and gas operators are confronted with more challenges than their international counterparts because of the fact that production costs for many wells in China are above competing international production prices. Given current crude oil prices, PetroChina, Sinopec, and CNOOC have been unable to compete within such a low-price environment and were forced to reduce production from many of their high-cost fields, mostly within China. In 2016, China’s capital investment in oil and gas exploration and production dived by 31.9% to RMB 233.1 billion Yuan (about USD32.4 billion). As a result, China’s oil output dropped 6.9% to 3.98 million bbl/d. Despite these challenges, low global crude oil prices have allowed the Chinese Government to fill its strategic petroleum reserve with inexpensive foreign crude oil.Oilfield service companies and equipment manufacturers have also been hurt badly by low oil prices as their customers stopped or delayed purchases to try to minimize expenditures. Some service companies and equipment manufacturers have reported that their businesses revenues have dropped between 30 to 50 percent this past year.International Oil Companies (IOCs) and international service companies have established their presence in China mostly through partnering with Chinese companies. At present, IOCs mostly team up with CNOOC in offshore oil development projects while service companies are hired by the Big Three oil giants on both onshore and offshore projects, which often include complex drillings. IOCs and international service companies have started working with Sinopec, PetroChina, and Yanchang to develop shale gas and tight oil and gas in Sichuan, the Erdos Basin, and Xinjiang.The following chart explains the market size and penetration of foreign products in this industry including drilling and refinery equipment, compressed vessels, and offshore engineering equipment. U.S. manufactured oil and gas equipment represents 50-60 percent of China imports in this sector.  This will likely increase in the future as China looks to more fully develop its shale gas resources, much of which are in more geologically complex locations than those of the United States. <U>China’s Oil and Gas Equipment Market (USD Billions)</U></P><TABLE border=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" style=""width: 582px; margin-left: 5.4pt;"" width=""582""><TBODY><TR style=""height: 1px;""><TD colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"" style=""width: 179px; height: 1px;""><P>Year</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Many deny it even exists. </P><P class=""p-text"">Doctors can’t prove that a particular pack of cigarettes caused a particular smoker’s cancer. We can’t prove that a specific contribution led to a specific vote in Congress. But to quote former Rep. Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, only politicians “take large amounts of <A href=""http://partners.nytimes.com/library/politics/1226campaign-funds.html"">money from strangers</A> and then act as if it has no effect on our behavior.”</P><P class=""p-text"">The <A href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=E01&amp;recipdetail=A&amp;sortorder=U&amp;mem=Y&amp;cycle=2016"">oil, gas</A>, <A href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=E1210&amp;recipdetail=A&amp;sortorder=U&amp;mem=Y&amp;cycle=2016"">coal</A> and <A href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=M02&amp;recipdetail=A&amp;sortorder=U&amp;mem=Y&amp;cycle=2016"">auto</A> industries sank more than nearly $43 million into GOP House and Senate races in 2016 alone, according to OpenSecrets.org, helping install Republican majorities in both chambers. To be sure, the polluters covered their bets with contributions to Democrats — but gave Republicans about $5 for every one that went to Democrats. </P><P class=""p-text"">Now they are cashing in. With strong support from congressional Republicans, President Trump is rolling back rules requiring cleaner energy and cleaner cars.</P><P class=""p-text"">To cheers from congressional Republicans and their fossil fuel industry benefactors, Trump quickly killed President Obama's program to reduce <mark>pollution</mark> from <A href=""http://www.baltimoresun.com/g00/news/maryland/environment/bs-md-clean-power-repeal-20171009-story.html?i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3D"">coal-fired power plants</A>.</P><P class=""p-text"">Automakers have lobbied the president and Congress to weaken Obama’s 54.5-<A href=""https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/obama-administration-finalizes-historic-545-mpg-fuel-efficiency-standards"">mile per gallon clean-car standard</A>. As early as December, the administration is expected to do just that. If enforced as originally written, the Obama standard, running through 2025, would be the biggest single step any nation has taken to fight global warming.

It declared that human activities, particularly emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and other pollutants, were to blame for what is now the warmest period in modern civilization.

They can increase their use of clean solar and wind power, improve energy efficiency in government buildings and in local building codes, and buy clean cars for official fleets, among other important steps.

Availability of water defines distribution of the country’s forests and decreases their productivity towards the south. <mark>Climate change</mark> generates a particular threat for Ukrainian forests and stability of agroforestry landscapes. This paper considers the impacts of expected <mark>climate change</mark> on vulnerability of Ukrainian forests using ensembles of global and regional climatic models (RCM) based on Scenarios B1, A2, A1B of the Intergovernmental Panel for <mark>Climate Change</mark>, and a “dry and warm” scenario A1B+T−P (increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation). The spatially explicit assessment was provided by RCM for the WMO standard period (1961–1990), “recent” (1991–2010) and three future periods: 2011–2030, 2031–2050 and 2081–2100. Forest-<mark>climate</mark> model by Vorobjov and model of amplitude of flora’s tolerance to <mark>climate change</mark> by Didukh, as well as a number of specialized climatic indicators, were used in the assessment. Different approaches lead to rather consistent conclusions. Water stress is the major limitation factor of distribution and resilience of flatland Ukrainian forests. Within Scenario A1B, the area with unsuitable growth conditions for major forest forming species will substantially increase by end of the century occupying major part of Ukraine. Scenario A1B+T−P projects even a more dramatic decline of the country’s forests. It is expected that the boundary of conditions that are favorable for forests will shift to north and northwest, and forests of the xeric belt will be the most vulnerable. Consistent policies of adaptation and mitigation might reduce <mark>climate</mark>-induced risks for Ukrainian forests.

</SPAN><SPAN class=""posted-on"">Posted on <TIME class=""published"" datetime=""October 21, 2011 at 9:00 am"">October 21, 2011,  9:00 am</TIME></SPAN></DIV></HEADER><DIV class=""entry-content""><P><A href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/69758711/Making-Fracking-Safe-in-the-East-and-West"">Read this brief in your web browser</A> (Scribd)</P><P>New and improved horizontal drilling, combined with hydraulic fracturing technologies, enable the United States to develop its abundant supply of natural gas from shale rock deep below the earth’s surface. China holds huge shale reserves as well and plans to follow suit. It would like to import technologies from the United States to do so, but the United States and its oil companies should not supply China with hydraulic fracturing technology without combining that technology with safety standards and environmental best practices. This includes capturing fugitive greenhouse gas emissions, monitoring the chemicals used in fracking fluid, and treating the wastewater to avoid contaminating local waterways.</P><P>This brief will review the factors leading China to seriously consider shale gas development and the potential problems the country faces in making this development a reality. It then examines shale development in the United States before closing with recommendations on how both countries can safely extract shale gas.</P><P>We start with a brief look at what shale gas is and the potential environmental problems shale development can produce if it does not follow best practices.</P><H3>What is shale gas?</H3><P>Shale gas is natural gas trapped in shale rock deep below the earth’s surface. Until recently, it was inaccessible for development due to its depth and concentration. New advances in horizontal drilling, combined with <A href=""/issues/green/report/2011/03/21/9241/drilling-down-on-fracking-concerns/"">hydraulic fracking</A> technology have enabled producers to capture this once elusive resource.</P><H3>Environmental concerns in shale gas development</H3><P>Shale gas can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. <A href=""http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/oilgas/publications/naturalgas_general/Shale_Gas_Primer_2009.pdf"">Natural gas</A> burns much more cleanly than coal or oil, so it produces less acid rain, smog, and toxics that damage public health and contribute to global warming. This is why many experts believe that shale gas could be the bridge between our fossil fuel reliance in the 20th century and clean renewable energy in this one.</P><P>Shale gas production, however, presents many <mark>pollution</mark> threats to the people of both nations that could negate its benefits. This includes surface and drinking water contamination, air <mark>pollution</mark>, and global warming <mark>pollution</mark>.</P><P>U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese General Secretary Hu Jintao recognized the importance of shale gas development to their nations by agreeing to the <A href=""http://www.doe.gov/sites/prod/files/edg/news/documents/US-China_Fact_Sheet_Shale_Gas.pdf"">U.S.-China Shale Gas Resource Initiative</A> in November 2009. This agreement fosters cooperation between these two nations by providing U.S. assistance to assess, develop, and promote investment in China’s shale gas reserves and to help develop operational best practices and effective environmental safeguards in China.</P><P>Our two nations are already making good progress on the exploration and development aspects of this agreement. But environmental cooperation is lagging behind. This is partly because the United States is still struggling to develop the most effective regulatory model for safeguards here at home.</P><P>Significantly more work is needed to ensure that both countries maximize the benefits from shale gas development—namely reducing oil imports and <mark>pollution</mark>—while minimizing the environmental risks.</P><P>Below we outline the available shale gas resources, primary <mark>pollution</mark> concerns, and environmental regulatory bodies in both nations.</P><H3>China’s interest in shale gas development</H3><P>From the Chinese perspective, the more homegrown energy supplies they can add to their current energy mix the better. China and the United States are the world’s<A href=""http://yearbook.enerdata.net/""> largest energy consumers</A> and greenhouse gas emitters. Both nations are blessed with ample homegrown energy supplies, but both also import significant amounts of oil. China also imports increasing amounts of coal and natural gas to power its ever-expanding economy.</P><P>Price and supply fluctuations in China’s oil and <A href=""http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2011-04/28/content_12409506.htm"">coal imports</A> triggered disruptive electricity blackouts in 2011, and that has increased their <A href=""http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2011-08/04/content_13047308.htm"">interest</A> in shale gas, which should be a more stable and predictable energy source since China’s resources appear to be abundant and the central government can more easily control the pricing for domestically produced energy supplies.</P><P>Over the long term, Chinese shale gas will be cheaper than importing liquefied <A href=""http://atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/MF24Cb01.html"">natural gas</A> over long-distance pipelines from Central Asia. But at least in the short term, shale gas will not be a <A href=""http://enviro-energy.com.hk/admin/uploads/files/1310022089Bernstein%20(070711).pdf"">game-changer</A> in China as it has been in the United States where development is less costly and already underway.</P><H3>China’s shale gas developments thus far</H3><P>The U.S. Energy Information Administration <A href=""http://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/worldshalegas/pdf/fullreport.pdf"">estimates that</A> China has 1.275 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable shale gas reserves. If that estimate is correct, China has the largest shale gas reserves in the world. (see chart)</P><P>China has seven major onshore shale basins (see map below). But only two—Sichuan and Tarim—are <A href=""http://enviro-energy.com.hk/admin/uploads/files/1310022089Bernstein%20(070711).pdf"">well suited</A> for commercial development. Those two basins contain <A href=""http://geology.com/usgs/oil-shale/"">marine shale</A> with sufficiently high organic content and sufficiently low clay content to make the quality of the natural gas (based on the organic matter) worth the development costs.</P><P>The Chinese government thus far has only issued permits for the Sichuan basin, which is located much closer to China’s urban and industrial demand markets and therefore offers a much better business case for developers.</P><P>China has not produced any shale gas for commercial use, and it is not clear how quickly it will ramp up production. China’s National Energy Agency set a draft production target of <A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-11/china-to-set-shale-gas-output-targets-securities-journal-says.html""> 6.5 billion cubic meters</A> or 229 billion cubic feet annually by 2015 and 2.8 trillion cubic feet annually by 2020. It is not clear, however, if those NEA targets are feasible or if they will receive central government approval.</P><P>China’s major state-owned energy companies are new to the shale gas industry, so they are teaming up with major international companies for shale gas exploration. The bilateral shale gas initiative with the United States led to multiple U.S.-China industry partnerships. Chevron, Shell, BP, EOG Resources, Newfield Exploration, ConocoPhillips, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes have all been working on the ground in China to help the Chinese explore their shale potential.</P><P>Those partnerships are starting to pay off. <A href=""http://af.reutersmedia.net/article/idAFTOE6BG03O20101217"">Sinopec</A> (working with BP) completed China’s first successful hydraulic fracturing exercise (successfully used U.S. fracturing technology to extract shale gas) in May 2010. And <A href=""http://www.pennenergy.com/index/articles/newsdisplay/1520198580.html"">PetroChina</A> (working with Royal Dutch Shell) drilled China’s first horizontal shale gas exploration well in Sichuan’s Weiyuan block in March 2011.</P><P>China’s Ministry of Land Resources, or MLR, launched the first round of bidding for China’s first commercial development permits in June 2011. Only six state-owned energy companies were allowed to submit bids: PetroChina, Sinopec, Cnooc, Shaanxi Yanchang petroleum, CUCBM, and Henan Provincial Coal Seam Gas.</P><P>The MLR divided the Sichuan basin into exploration and development blocks and put four blocks <A href=""http://www.china.org.cn/business/2011-07/08/content_22950543.htm"">up for bid</A>. According to Chinese regulations, each shale block must receive at least three bids before it can be auctioned off. Only two blocks received enough bids—Nanchuan and Xiushan—so only those two blocks <A href=""http://www.china.org.cn/business/2011-07/08/content_22950543.htm"">were licensed</A>. SinoPec and Henan Coal Seam Development Corp. were the two winners.</P><P>The MLR is currently preparing to open up the second and third rounds of bidding. The second round will take place in the <A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-11/china-to-set-shale-gas-output-targets-securities-journal-says.html"">fourth quarter</A> of 2011. That round will be open to private companies. The major foreign oil companies mentioned above are hoping to leverage their technology and know-how to gain access to China’s shale market, but the second-round bidding will be limited to Chinese majority enterprises only.</P><H3>China faces technical challenges</H3><P>China faces several hurdles to developing its shale gas reserves. For one, there are several characteristics of China’s shale deposits that will raise development costs. Compared to the United States, China’s shale deposits are generally located deeper underground. They also contain more nonhydro<mark>carbon</mark> gasses—particularly hydrogen sulfide, possibly <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and nitrogen—and they are located in rougher (more hilly/mountainous) terrain.</P><P>China also lacks the technology to develop these deposits. China’s oil companies are <A href=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2011-05/04/c_121377374.htm"">depending heavily</A> on the United States for shale technology. Their firms are acquiring overseas assets to gain horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technology in addition to the exploration partnerships mentioned above. PetroChina, for example, purchased stakes in Australia’s <A href=""http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2010-08/24/content_11193548.htm"">Arrow Energy</A>, and Sinopec recently announced a deal to acquire <A href=""http://cnrp.marketwire.com/cnrp_files/20111009-1009day.pdf"">Daylight Energy</A>, a Canadian shale producer. CNOOC purchased stakes in <A href=""http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/cnooc-takes-further-chesapeake-stake/"">Chesapeake Energy</A> (United States) and <A href=""http://www.exoma.net/index.php?/news_and_more/view/Chinese_Government_approval_of_CNOOC_Strategic_Farm-in_leads_to_first_drill"">Exoma Energy</A> (Australia).</P><P>But the proven technology solutions developed for the U.S. market may not be a good fit in China since China’s shale deposits differ geologically from those in the United States. And Chinese firms may struggle to adjust those solutions to fit local conditions. In addition, U.S. energy companies have limited influence on how their Chinese partners use U.S. technology and whether they employ the operational best practices developed in the United States—China is only awarding exploration and development rights to majority Chinese entities, so that means that the U.S. participants are always minority partners and cannot exert operational control.</P><P>Water shortages are another challenge. Shale development requires vast amounts of water, and that will be difficult in China where water supplies are <A href=""http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china%E2%80%94confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-country/"">already scarce</A>. This is one reason why Chinese leaders are only issuing permits for the Sichuan basin, where water scarcity is less of a problem than the arid Tarim basin.</P><P>China’s pipeline infrastructure is also a <A href=""http://journal.probeinternational.org/2011/09/28/shale-gas-in-china/"">potential bottleneck</A>. The central government is working to increase pipeline capacity. But infrastructure expansion takes time, and current pipeline constraints will further slow Chinese shale development.</P><P>China’s Ministry of Land and Resources announced a <A href=""http://www.naturalgasasia.com/chia-shale-gas-development"">development target</A> of expanding shale gas from 8 percent to 12 percent of China’s natural gas production by 2020. Natural gas currently accounts for 4 percent of China’s domestic energy consumption, and Chinese leaders are aiming to <A href=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-06/08/c_13340134.htm"">increase that</A> to 10 percent by 2020. At best, then, Chinese leaders are shooting for shale gas to account for around 1 percent of overall energy consumption by 2020.</P><P>Even in the best case scenario the actual greenhouse gas reductions from switching from coal to shale gas would be minimal in the near term since shale gas will only account for a small percentage of China’s energy mix. The biggest short-term environmental issue, therefore, is the potential local environmental impacts from shale gas development.</P><H3>Environmental challenges with Chinese shale gas</H3><P>As in the United States, some in China are concerned that shale gas development could trigger a major <mark>pollution</mark> crisis.</P><P>U.S. environmental impact studies suggest that sound equipment and operational best practices are critical for protecting groundwater and limiting fugitive gasses from shale extraction. But development companies will not follow those best practices without strict environmental regulation. And environmental regulation is not something China is good at.</P><P>China’s Environmental Protection Ministry, or MEP, is underfunded, and the ministry struggles to accurately monitor what is going on at the local level. Even when local-level Environmental Protection Bureaus, or EPBs, possess accurate information about local production operations, those officials are subordinate to the regional provincial, municipal, and county-level People’s government units (similar to state, municipal, and county governments in the United States), and the People’s government officials (who are responsible for the region as a whole) generally prioritize economic growth over environmental protection.</P><P>So where there are Chinese shale developments, if exploration and development activity produces harmful emissions or other <mark>pollution</mark> you can be sure that the local People’s government (which earns tax revenue from commercial developments in their region) will use its budgetary and personnel authority to keep the local EPB quiet.</P><P>As in the United States, China’s shale market developments are already outpacing legislation. Chinese leaders are working on a major <A href=""http://www.mep.gov.cn/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_9766690D3434D92868EDCF076B6C6C7710570200/filename/W020091019369619465677.pdf"">environmental protection bill</A>, the “Technology Policy for Preventing Environmental <mark>Pollution</mark> from Oil and Natural Gas Extraction.” But the current draft does not include guidelines for shale gas development, and it would be difficult to add in shale-specific guidelines at this point in the drafting process. China’s guidelines for conventional gas will not be adequate for addressing the specific environmental concerns associated with shale.</P><P>China faces bigger air <mark>pollution</mark> risks since its shale gas deposits generally contain more poisonous <A href=""http://enviro-energy.com.hk/admin/uploads/files/1310022089Bernstein (070711).pdf"">hydrogen sulfide</A> than U.S. deposits. Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic pollutant, and it is also highly <A href=""http://www.drillingcontractor.org/how-to-ensure-h2s-safety-on-offshore-rigs-8267"">corrosive</A>, so it can corrode drilling equipment and increase fugitive emissions of other pollutants such as methane. Preventing these problems will require strict emission standards and advanced drilling and gas purifying technology—two things China will struggle with.</P><P>But even though China’s environmental regulators are relatively weak and underfunded, we can expect China to be stricter on water issues than U.S. regulators. In general, China’s Water Ministry has more political power than the MEP because China suffers from severe water shortages. And when China’s water supplies are too low or too polluted that shuts down industrial production. (Air <mark>pollution</mark> does not have the same immediate economic impact.)</P><P>China has a history of shutting down factories or forbidding certain production practices because they use or contaminate too much water. The central government capped coal production in the 12th five-year plan to address <A href=""http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/china-responds-to-explosive-growth-<mark>pollution</mark>-and-water-scarcity-in-latest-five-year-plan/"">water concerns</A>, and Chinese leaders already <A href=""http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/HJ04Cb01.html"">restrict</A> permits for new coal liquefaction projects due to their high water consumption rates.</P><P>Water shortages are one reason China is only issuing development permits for the Sichuan shale basin, not for the Tarim. China’s water concerns will almost certainly result in tighter regulations for wastewater treatment at shale development sites, which is something we already see in other Chinese industries.</P><H3>United States shale gas development</H3><P>Pulitzer Prize-winning energy author <A href=""http://www.npr.org/2011/09/20/140606249/daniel-yergin-examines-americas-quest-for-energy"">Daniel Yergin</A> notes how quickly natural gas from shale formations joined the energy mix in the United States:</P><P style=""margin-left: 40px;""><I>Shale gas really has been a revolution that’s happened extremely rapidly…It’s gone from being virtually none of our natural gas production to about 30 percent of our total natural gas production.</I></P><P>This big change in the U.S. energy portfolio is the result of technological advancements to produce significant amounts of shale gas. These gas reserves are locked within shale rock deep in the earth. Improvements in horizontal drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” enables companies to free and collect the natural gas otherwise trapped in the shale rock</P><P>The ability to collect this formerly unavailable natural gas has increased projected resources by one-third to 2.5 trillion cubic feet of gas. This is “enough to supply over 100 years of use” according to the <A href=""http://www.eia.gov/energy_in_brief/about_shale_gas.cfm"">Energy Information Administration.</A></P><P><A href=""http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/oil-gas/publications/brochures/Shale_Gas_March_2011.pdf"">Annual U.S. shale gas production</A> increased by 15 times between 2000 and 2010, from 0.3 trillion cubic feet to 4.5 trillion cubic feet. Shale gas composed a much greater portion of the U.S. natural gas supply between 2000 to 2009, growing from 2 percent to 14 percent. EIA projects that in 2035 shale gas will provide nearly half of all total U.S. natural gas supply.</P><P>The <A href=""http://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/usshalegas/"">largest shale gas play</A> is the Marcellus that runs from upstate New York through Western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, West Virginia, and eastern Kentucky. As of January 2009, it held more than half of the “undeveloped technically recoverable shale gas” remaining in shale plays according to EIA.</P><P>Two of the early plays developed were the Barnett shale around Ft. Worth and the Haynesville play on both sides of the Texas-Louisiana border. These two hold an estimated 6 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of the undeveloped shale gas.</P><H3>Environmental challenges with U.S. shale gas production</H3><P>Producing natural gas from these and other shale plays is no simple task, though. The fracking process involves injecting huge volumes of water mixed with sand and chemicals deep underground to fracture rock formations and release trapped gas. This process risks contamination of underground drinking water supplies, as well as the contamination of surface water from the discharge of wastewater that is a byproduct of drilling. In addition, fracking can release previously trapped methane gas—a potent greenhouse gas pollutant. Finally, the surface fracking operations—including diesel trucks and generators—release the ingredients for smog, which also poses health risks.</P><P>Unlike air and water <mark>pollution</mark> from most other industrial sources, the federal government has very limited ability to require shale gas producers to reduce their water, air, and global warming <mark>pollution</mark>. Under pressure from big oil companies, <A href=""/issues/green/news/2011/06/03/9886/bringing-fracking-to-the-surface/"">Congress has exempted oil and gas production from numerous health and safety laws</A>. (see table above) Consequently, the states have primary responsibility for establishing and enforcing safeguards for shale gas production.</P><P>For instance, many citizen groups and neighbors adjacent to fracking operations would like companies to provide full public disclosure of the toxic and other chemicals used in their fracking fluids. These operations are currently exempt from the Toxic Release Inventory reporting requirements under the federal <A href=""/issues/green/news/2010/04/06/7613/energy-industry-fights-chemical-disclosure/"">Community Right to Know</A> law, but states can require such disclosure.</P><P>Some companies have volunteered to disclose some information about the chemical components of their fracking fluid. But this is no substitute for industrywide reporting.</P><P><A href=""http://www.fulbright.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=publications.detail&amp;pub_id=5154&amp;site_id=494&amp;detail=yes"">Some states</A> have begun to require some disclosure in 2011:</P><P style=""margin-left: 40px;""><I>Earlier this year, Texas became the latest state to draft regulations requiring the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Michigan and Montana issued similar regulations over the summer, joining Arkansas, Wyoming, and Pennsylvania as states recently active in regulating hydraulic fracturing.</I></P><P>It is also up to the states to establish drinking water safeguards for fracking. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 exempts fracking from the safe underground disposal requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act.</P><P>The <A href=""http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/oilgas/publications/naturalgas_general/Shale_Gas_Primer_2009.pdf"">U.S. Department of Energy</A>, however, found that “state laws generally give the state oil and gas director or agency the discretion to require whatever is necessary to protect human health and the environment.” This means that agencies responsible for natural gas production—not agencies with responsibility and expertise for health or environmental protection—develop and implement drinking water safeguards for fracking.</P><P>Such an oversight system may be why <A href=""http://www.propublica.org/article/science-lags-as-health-problems-emerge-near-gas-fields"">ProPublica</A>, a nonprofit investigative journalism organization, “reported about hundreds of cases of water contamination in more than six states where drilling and fracking are taking place” since 2008.</P><P>Fracking can also contaminate surface rivers and lakes due to the discharge of its wastewater into these waters or sewage treatment plants not designed to remove fracking-related pollutants. These contaminants pass through partially or completely untreated into the receiving waters.</P><P>A <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/us/27gas.html?scp=17&amp;sq=IAN+URBINA&amp;st=nyt""><I>New York Times</I> investigation</A> found that:</P><P style=""margin-left: 40px;""><I>A well can produce over a million gallons of wastewater that is often laced with highly corrosive salts, carcinogens like benzene and radioactive elements like radium, all of which can occur naturally thousands of feet underground. Other carcinogenic materials can be added to the wastewater by the chemicals used in the hydrofracking itself.</I></P><P>Wastewater… is sometimes hauled to sewage plants not designed to treat it and then discharged into rivers that supply drinking water.</P><P>Air <mark>pollution</mark> is also a byproduct of fracking. The <A href=""http://www.epa.gov/airquality/oilandgas/pdfs/20110728factsheet.pdf"">Environmental Protection Agency</A> determined that fracking produces carcinogens such as benzene and toluene, volatile organic compounds that contribute to smog, and methane.</P><P>Fortunately, EPA has the authority to require reductions of these pollutants, and this July it proposed standards to achieve:</P><P style=""margin-left: 40px;""><I>…nearly 95 percent reduction in VOCs emitted from new and modified hydraulically fractured gas wells. This significant reduction would be accomplished primarily through use of a proven technology to capture natural gas that currently escapes to the air. That gas would then be made available for sale…the proposed rule is anticipated to quickly result in a net savings of nearly $30 million annually.</I></P><P>The proposed reduction standards must be finalized by February 2012.</P><P>In <A href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/blueprint_secure_energy_future.pdf"">President Barack Obama</A>’s March 30, 2011 energy proposal he noted that shale gas could play a large role in U.S. energy policy, particularly with the mitigation of these environmental impacts:</P><P style=""margin-left: 40px;""><I>Recent technology and operational improvements in extracting natural gas resources, particularly shale gas, have increased gas drilling activities nationally and led to significantly higher natural gas production estimates for decades to come.</I></P><P style=""margin-left: 40px;""><I>The Administration is taking steps to address these [environmental] concerns and ensure that natural gas production proceeds in a safe and responsible manner.</I></P><P>As part of this effort the president asked Secretary of Energy Steven Chu to convene an <A href=""http://www.shalegas.energy.gov/resources/081111_90_day_report.pdf"">Advisory Board Shale Gas Production Subcommittee</A>. Its charge was:</P><P style=""margin-left: 40px;""><I>To identify, within 90 days, any immediate steps that can be taken to improve the safety and environmental performance of fracking and to develop, within six months, consensus recommended advice to the agencies on practices for shale extraction to ensure the protection of public health and the environment.</I></P><P>The first set of recommendations was issued on August 11, 2011. They focused on immediate steps that shale gas producers could take to reduce the <mark>pollution</mark> threat posed by fracking.</P><P>They included the following steps:</P><UL><LI>“Improve public information about shale operations,” and make it easily available.</LI></UL><UL><LI>“Improve air quality: Reduce emissions of air pollutants, ozone precursors, and methane as quickly as practicable. The Subcommittee supports adoption of rigorous standards for new and existing sources of methane, air toxics, ozone precursors and other air pollutants.”</LI></UL><UL><LI>“Protection of Water Quality” by industry adoption of “best practices” for well development and construction, and other operations. Conduct baseline assessments of water contamination before fracking begins to better assess new contamination.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Prompt public “disclosure of fracturing fluid composition.”</LI></UL><UL><LI>Reduce “the use of diesel fuel…there is no technical or economic reason to use diesel… [reduce] the use of diesel engines for surface power in favor of natural gas engines or electricity where available.”</LI></UL><P>The subcommittee is in the midst of a second 90-day review period when it plans to focus more on the “regulatory schemes in place” to reduce environmental contamination, as well as “the creation of a timetable and action plan for implementation of the Subcommittee’s recommendations.” The second review should speed oil and gas companies’ implementation of the earlier recommendations, as well as provide guidance about the appropriate federal and state enforcement roles. In addition, the Natiponal Academy of Sciences should undertake a comprehensive and credible study of the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from the production and use of shale gas.</P><H3>Bilateral shale gas cooperation: Safeguards are essential in both nations</H3><P>The U.S.-China Shale Gas Resource Initiative aims to provide U.S. technical assistance to China across all aspects of shale gas development, including safety and environmental protection. So far, however, China’s policymakers have paid little attention to safeguards. This follows the U.S. model. Shale gas production here has far outpaced the establishment and enforcement of <mark>pollution</mark> protections.</P><P>Environmental protection remains a low priority for both sides. Neither nation wants to risk the commerical potential of China’s shale gas by vigorously pursuing einvornmental protection there. Most of the U.S. companies involved in these bilateral exploration and development projects <A href=""http://www.cheminfo.gov.cn/ZXZX/page_info.aspx?id=276022&amp;Tname=hgyw&amp;c=10"">want to exchange</A> assessment and extraction technology for Chinese commercial market access. The <A href=""http://www.cheminfo.gov.cn/ZXZX/page_info.aspx?id=276022&amp;Tname=hgyw&amp;c=10"">Chinese want</A> technology transfers from the United States that include the more mature and advanced technologies that the United States often holds back due to intellectual property right concerns.</P><P>Now that the initial exploration phase in China is complete, the United States must help prevent the environmental consequences of Chinese shale gas production. If China does not follow best practices to capture greenhouse gases, it is highly likely that shale development will <I>increase</I> China’s emissions instead of decreasing them. And that will worsen <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>A major Chinese environmental disaster, such as groundwater <mark>pollution</mark>, could be devastating for China’s economy. It could also easily increase public opposition to fracking in the United States, just like the Fukushima nuclear meltdown in Japan increased American opposition to nuclear power. The U.S. companies involved in China’s shale industry therefore have a strong incentive to support bilateral environmental protection efforts.</P><P>Energy producers with new technologies are far ahead of environmental safeguards. In China, this struggle will be even bigger than it is here in the United States because the Chinese are importing this technology from us and starting a new industry overnight. China’s <A href=""http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2011/07/12/China-considers-shale-gas-production/UPI-31521310492268/"">Environmental Protection Ministry</A> has not conducted extensive studies on shale gas development, and Chinese journalists have recently begun <A href=""http://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/20110912/033410466235.shtml"">traveling abroad</A> to study our shale developments and learn from our experiences and concerns. But that education process will take time—just as it did here—and China’s environmental activists face more constraints than their U.S. counterparts.</P><P>In sum, the United States and its oil companies should not export hydraulic fracking technology without pairing that technology with safety standards and best environmental practices.</P><P><I>Melanie Hart is a Policy Analyst on China Energy and <mark>Climate Policy</mark> and Daniel J.

I am interested in the causes of the large-scale patterns of species diversity and the responses of species to past and future climatic change. Since 2005, I have been working on the Database of China’s Woody Plants (containing the distributions of 11,405 woody species in China), and the patterns of plant species richness and beta diversity in China. My current and future research combines phylogeography with macroecology to explore how <mark>climate</mark> and species evolution determine local and regional species diversity, and how climatic change influences species distributions.

The U.S. Embassy in Beijing reported that levels of PM 2.5—a type of particulate air <mark>pollution</mark> that seeps into lung, vein, and heart tissue—surged above 850 micrograms per cubic meter; the UN says that 20 micrograms per cubic meter is the highest safe level.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-2""><P>Schools, highways, and airports closed. <A href=""http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1126724/northern-china-health-alert-smog-worsens"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'520197'"">More than 7,000 children</A> were sent to Beijing Children’s Hospital on a single day. At least 50 of the country’s 74 major cities exceeded national air-quality standards. The episode remains the worst haze <mark>pollution</mark> ever recorded in the month of January.</P><P>Something was strange about the smog. Usually smog will dissipate when sources of air <mark>pollution</mark>—like cars or factories—shut down for a time. But this cloud was stubborn. As part of solar new year celebrations in February 2013, millions of families drove their cars out of Beijing to go on vacation, and the government ordered all factories to cease operations. The smog didn’t subside much, and less than a week later <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/16/chinese-struggle-through-airpocalypse-smog"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'520197'"">the full-on “airpocalypse” returned </A>as bad as before.</P><P>What made the winter smog so bad that year—and in the winters since, which have also been stubbornly smoggy? Two new studies revisit the episode. Both of them argue that <mark>climate change</mark> will make this kind of smog event much more common. And, remarkably, one of them asserts that the Chinese smog of January 2013 was worsened by two weather phenomena thousands of miles away. Because the Arctic Ocean froze less than it usually does, and because higher-than-usual snowdrifts piled up across the boreal forests of Russia, millions of Chinese people were subjected to some of the worst air <mark>pollution</mark> ever measured.</P><P>That’s because the smog of January 2013 wasn’t the result of emissions alone: Weather played the accomplice. For most of that winter, air over eastern China barely circulated. Trade winds went dormant, so smog could not ventilate to the east; and vertical circulation slowed, meaning particulate matter could not float up into the higher atmosphere. And as is typical for Chinese winters, rain never arrived to wash air <mark>pollution</mark> out.</P></SECTION><FIGURE class=""full-width"" style=""max-width: 960.0px;""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption"">Heavy smog blows across mountains in Hebei province, in northern China, in January 2017.

These shape the <mark>climate</mark> of China mostly through their differing temperatures. And when the Arctic is especially warm, and Siberia is covered with snow and especially cold, they combine to reduce the atmospheric-pressure gradient across Asia.

Now likely the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, China has become the focus of scrutiny as <mark>climate change</mark> has become ever more important as a global issue. Increased international attention to the issue is reflected in China’s domestic policy circles as well, primarily through institutional restructuring aimed at better government coordination on <mark>climate</mark>-related policy activities. China released its first national <mark>climate change</mark> plan this year, composed of measures being taken across the economy that may help slow China’s greenhouse gas emissions growth.</P><P>Yet, China faces substantial challenges in mitigating its increasing contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, which will require a much higher level of effort than what may be achieved by measures already in place. Understanding the nature of these challenges in the Chinese context helps to clarify China’s negotiating position in international forums and can provide insights into how the international community might best engage China to address global <mark>climate change</mark>.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT1"" name=""REF1"">1</A></SUP></P><P class=""sec-headA""><STRONG>Competing Priorities</STRONG></P><P>China’s <mark>climate</mark> strategy remains centered on its energy development strategy as driven by its overall economic development goals. Although attention to <mark>climate change</mark> has recently increased among China’s leadership, <mark>climate change</mark> has not surpassed economic development as a policy priority. The Chinese <STRONG>[End Page 155]</STRONG> leadership has shown the ability to adapt to or resist both internal and external changes and pressures over time.</P><P>Yet, the causes of <mark>climate change</mark>, namely greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and land use, are inherently linked to economic development in the Chinese context. Continued growth in the prosperity of the population is viewed as fundamental to maintaining political stability, and progress to date in this regard has been impressive. China’s economic growth over the past two decades, marked by a quadrupling in its gross domestic product (GDP) from 1980 to 2000, has been credited with pulling roughly 50 million people out of poverty.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT2"" name=""REF2"">2</A></SUP></P><P>The relationship between economic growth and energy utilization matters greatly not only from an emissions perspective, but from an energy security perspective as well. Although China quadrupled its GDP between 1980 and 2000, it did so while merely doubling the amount of energy it consumed over that period, marking a dramatic achievement in energy-intensity gains not paralleled in any other country at a similar stage of industrialization. This allowed China’s energy intensity (ratio of energy consumption to GDP) and consequently the emissions intensity (ratio of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide [CO<SUB>2</SUB>]–equivalent emissions to GDP) of its economy to decline (see <A href=""#fig01"">figure 1</A>). Without this reduction in the energy intensity of the economy, China would have used more than three times the energy that it did during this period.</P><P>Between 2002 and 2005, however, this trend reversed, and energy growth surpassed economic growth for the first time in decades. This reversal has had dramatic emissions implications, with China’s greenhouse gas emissions growing very rapidly since 2002. Although official data for 2006 are not yet available, estimates show that emissions from energy use are up 9 percent from the previous year, which would make China the largest emitter on an annual basis, surpassing U.S. emissions that year by 8 percent.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT3"" name=""REF3"">3</A></SUP> In 2006, global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from fossil fuel use increased by about 2.6 percent, driven by a 4.5 percent increase in global coal consumption, of which China contributed more than 66 percent.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT4"" name=""REF4"">4</A></SUP> Currently, China emits 35 percent more CO<SUB>2 </SUB>per dollar of output than the United States and 100 percent more than the European Union. China’s increase in energy-related emissions in the past few years has been driven primarily by industrial energy use, fueled by an increased percentage of coal in the overall fuel mix. Industry consumes about 70 percent of China’s energy, and China’s industrial base supplies much of the world. For example, China today produces 35 percent of the world’s steel and 28 percent of aluminum, up from 12 percent and 8 percent, respectively, a decade ago.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT5"" name=""REF5"">5</A></SUP><STRONG>[End Page 156]</STRONG></P><P>China relies on coal for more than two-thirds of its energy needs, including approximately 80 percent of its electricity needs. Currently, more coal power plants are installed in China than in the United States and India combined. China’s coal power use is expected to more than double by 2030, representing an additional <mark>carbon</mark> commitment of about 86 billion tons.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT6"" name=""REF6"">6</A></SUP> Although China is also expanding its utilization of nuclear power and nonhydroelectric renewables, these sources comprise 2 percent and 0.7 percent of China’s electricity generation, respectively, whereas hydroelectricity contributes about 16 percent.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT7"" name=""REF7"">7</A></SUP></P><P>China’s overall economic development statistics reveal that, despite the emergence of modern cities and a growing middle class, China is still largely a developing country. Although rapid economic growth has made China the fourth-largest economy in the world, its GDP per capita is still below the world average. More than one-half of China’s population lives in rural areas where GDP per capita lags that of urban areas. The gap between the best available technologies worldwide and what exists in China is still large, although advanced energy technology is increasingly available and in many cases being developed indigenously. China’s per capita greenhouse gas emissions are below the world average and almost one-fifth those of the United States. <STRONG>[End Page 157]</STRONG></P><P>All of these factors shape the <mark>climate</mark> challenge faced by China’s leadership. It is increasingly difficult for China to rein in its greenhouse gas emissions growth as investment surges continue in heavy industry. Changing China’s emissions trajectory will require either a substantial shift away from coal or massive investments in capturing the CO<SUB>2 </SUB>emissions from coal-based energy sources. Simultaneously, China must increase the efficiency with which it uses energy resources to minimize the environmental impacts of meeting the further economic development needs of its population.</P><P class=""sec-headA""><STRONG><mark>Climate</mark> Action in China</STRONG></P><P>Although the goal of “building a resource-efficient and environment-friendly society” is prominent in China’s current five-year plan, many obstacles must be overcome before achieving it. These challenges shape the way China is approaching <mark>climate</mark> mitigation at the domestic level, as well as its position in international negotiations.</P><P>A look at the Chinese institutions that have been responsible for <mark>climate change</mark> policy is one way to understand how the government has approached this issue over time. Starting in the 1980s, China treated <mark>climate change</mark> as a scientific issue and gave the State Meteorological Administration the responsibility of advising the government on policy options in international negotiations surrounding the UN Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (UNFCCC).</P><P>As political awareness and sensitivity surrounding <mark>climate change</mark> increased in the late 1990s, this role shifted to the more powerful State Development and Planning Commission, which has since evolved into the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). The move indicated a shift in the relative value given to the issue, as well as perhaps a shift in perspective from a scientific issue to predominantly a development issue.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT8"" name=""REF8"">8</A></SUP></P><P>The NDRC also serves as the primary energy policy decisionmaking authority in China, and this move may have reflected the clear need for <mark>climate</mark> priorities to be coordinated better with energy decisions. It is now home to the National Coordination Committee on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, which oversees <mark>climate</mark> activities within the NDRC, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Science and Technology, and the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA). Today, the NDRC and the Foreign Ministry are responsible for formulating China’s international negotiation positions.</P><P>Further institutional change came recently with the release of China’s national <mark>climate change</mark> plan in June 2007, announcing a high-level leading group on <mark>climate change</mark> chaired by Premier Wen Jiabao and reporting to the State Council. Subsequently, the Foreign Ministry announced that it had also established <STRONG>[End Page 158]</STRONG> a leading group in charge of international work on <mark>climate change</mark>, headed by Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi. Then in early September, Ambassador Yu Qingtai was appointed to be China’s new special representative of the Foreign Ministry for <mark>climate change</mark> negotiations. The role of this new special representative is to help implement China’s domestic action plan to respond to <mark>climate change</mark> and to demonstrate “the government’s active participation in international cooperation on responding to <mark>climate change</mark>.”<SUP><A href=""#FOOT9"" name=""REF9"">9</A></SUP></P><P>The establishment of these two high-level leading groups and the appointment of a special representative on <mark>climate change</mark> in 2007 are positive signs that the Chinese leadership is focusing new attention on the issue. It is also apparent that leading Chinese research organizations that often provide analytical input to shape government policy decisions are scaling up their work in this area.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT10"" name=""REF10"">10</A></SUP></P><P>The government released its first “National Assessment Report on <mark>Climate Change</mark>” in late 2006, conducted as a collaborative effort among more than 20 government departments and taking four years to complete.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT11"" name=""REF11"">11</A></SUP> Structured similarly to the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> reports, the Chinese assessment consists of three parts: <mark>climate change</mark> history and trends, impacts and adaptation, and mitigation and socioeconomic evaluation.</P><P>Subsequently, China released its much anticipated National <mark>Climate Change</mark> Program report on June 4, 2007.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT12"" name=""REF12"">12</A></SUP> Referred to as China’s <mark>climate change</mark> plan, the report has provided a comprehensive synthesis of the policies that China currently has in place that are serving to moderate its greenhouse gas emissions growth and to help the country adapt to <mark>climate</mark> impacts. The majority of the policies and programs mentioned in the plan are not <mark>climate change</mark> policies per se, but policies implemented throughout the economy, particularly in the energy sector, that have the effect of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Many of these policies have been enacted to help the country meet its broader economic development strategies and, if implemented effectively, will also serve as policies to mitigate China’s greenhouse gas emissions. Three of these key policy areas are energy efficiency, renewable energy, and industrial policy.</P><P class=""sec-headB""><STRONG>Energy Efficiency</STRONG></P><P>With the hope of achieving energy intensity improvements between 2000 and 2020 similar to what it had done the previous two decades, China has a broad <STRONG>[End Page 159]</STRONG> national goal of quadrupling economic growth while doubling energy consumption.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT13"" name=""REF13"">13</A></SUP> Beijing’s eleventh five-year plan includes a near-term goal of reducing national energy intensity 20 percent below 2005 levels by 2010. Implementation of such centrally administered government targets has proven challenging, particularly at the local level. In an attempt to improve local accountability, the NDRC is allocating the target among provinces and industrial sectors, and energy efficiency improvement is now among the criteria used to evaluate the job performance of local officials. These elevated implementation efforts appear to be having some impact. Following increases in energy intensity each year from 2003 to 2005, the trend was reversed in 2006, although the intensity decline achieved was short of the goal for that year.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT14"" name=""REF14"">14</A></SUP></P><P>Supplementary programs have been established to encourage specific actors to help meet this national intensity goal, including a program established in 2006 to improve energy efficiency in China’s largest enterprises.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT15"" name=""REF15"">15</A></SUP> Another government effort targets the elimination of a number of small, inefficient power plants, totaling around 8 percent of China’s generating capacity, by 2010. Similar plant closings are planned across the industrial sector, including inefficient cement, aluminum, ferroalloy, coking, calcium carbide, and steel plants.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT16"" name=""REF16"">16</A></SUP></P><P>In addition, the 1997 Energy Conservation Law initiated a range of programs to increase energy efficiency in buildings, industry, and consumer goods. China has efficiency standards and labeling programs in place for many key energy-consuming appliances and is adopting energy standards for buildings in regions with high heating and cooling demands. In the transport sector, China’s fuel economy standards for its rapidly growing passenger vehicle fleet are more stringent than those in Australia, Canada, and the United States, although less stringent than those in the EU and Japan, and the average fuel economy of new vehicles is projected to reach 36.7 miles per gallon in 2008.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT17"" name=""REF17"">17</A></SUP></P><P class=""sec-headB""><STRONG>Renewable Energy</STRONG></P><P>Under the National Renewable Energy Law adopted in 2005, China has set a target of producing 16 percent of its primary energy from renewable sources by 2020, up from about 7 percent at present. For the electricity sector, the target is 20 percent of the capacity from renewables by 2020, which will require substantial increases in the use of wind power, biomass power, solar power, and <STRONG>[End Page 160]</STRONG> hydropower. This law offers financial incentives, such as a national fund to foster renewable energy development and discounted lending and tax preferences for renewable energy projects. Although increases in wind power in particular have been impressive in recent years, this energy source is still dwarfed by large-scale hydropower. Hydropower capacity is projected to more than double by 2020, requiring the equivalent of a new dam the size of the Three Gorges Project every two years.</P><P>Policies to promote renewable energy also include mandates and incentives to support the development of domestic technologies and industries, for instance, by requiring the use of domestically manufactured components. Spurred by a requirement that newly installed wind turbines contain 70 percent local content, Chinese manufacturers are now producing about 40 percent of the wind turbines being sold in China and 3 percent of the wind turbines being sold globally. Tax and other incentives have targeted the solar photovoltaic (PV) industry, stimulating a sixfold growth in PV production from 2004 to 2005. A recent market study estimates that the Chinese PV industry will dominate the global market within five years; China is currently the third-largest producer of solar PVs for the global market.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT18"" name=""REF18"">18</A></SUP></P><P class=""sec-headB""><STRONG>Industrial Policies</STRONG></P><P>The recent surge in energy consumption by heavy industry in China has caused the government to implement measures to discourage growth in energy-intensive industries compared with sectors that are less energy intensive. In November 2006, the Ministry of Finance increased export taxes on energy-intensive industries. This includes a 15 percent export tax on copper, nickel, aluminum, and other metals; a 10 percent tax on steel primary products; and a 5 percent tax on petroleum, coal, and coke. Simultaneously, import tariffs on 26 energy and resource products, including coal, petroleum, aluminum, and other mineral resources, will be cut from their current levels of 3–6 percent to 0–3 percent.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT19"" name=""REF19"">19</A></SUP> Whereas the increased export tariffs are meant to discourage relocation of energy-intensive industries to China for export markets, the reduced import tariffs are meant to promote the utilization of energy-intensive products produced elsewhere.</P><P class=""sec-headA""><STRONG>Framing China’s Negotiating Position</STRONG></P><P>China’s position in the international <mark>climate</mark> negotiations has rarely deviated from the rest of the developing world, as collectively articulated by the Group of 77 (G-77), a group of 130 (formerly 77) developing countries. Recently, the financial incentives for emissions reductions provided by the Kyoto Protocol’s <STRONG>[End Page 161]</STRONG> Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) has also helped shape China’s views on the international <mark>climate</mark> regime.</P><P class=""sec-headB""><STRONG>G-77 Solidarity</STRONG></P><P>Developing-country solidarity has been used as a strategy since the early days to influence <mark>climate change</mark> negotiations, despite the growing economic differentiation and often disparate <mark>climate policy</mark> interests within the developing world. Aware of their limited weight of acting in isolation, developing countries attempt to build common positions in the framework of the G-77,<SUP><A href=""#FOOT20"" name=""REF20"">20</A></SUP> the largest intergovernmental organization of developing states in the United Nations. The G-77 provides a means for these countries to articulate and promote their collective economic interests and enhance their joint negotiating capacity on all major issues within the UN system.</P><P>China has historically associated itself with the G-77 despite not having the problem of limited weight in acting alone. Rather than acting alone, it can use the G-77 block as protection against being singled out. As the largest developing-country emitter, this concern is certainly rational. Yet, its size allows it to take a leadership role in formulating the positions of the G-77. China has a hand in crafting its position while ensuring that a large contingent of countries will stand at its side when it is presented before the world. The consistent position of the G-77 has been to emphasize the historical responsibility that the industrialized world brings to the <mark>climate change</mark> problem and the disparity between per capita emissions that persists between the developed and developing world, resisting any commitments to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>In recent years, China’s alliance with the G-77 has not waned. In fact, its willingness to step out of the pack has declined even further as its fear of being singled out grows due to increasing economic growth and energy use. In June 2005, then–SEPA director Xie Zhenhua, now a vice minister of the NDRC, stated that he hoped “that some countries would, according to the obligations which are provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, implement in a substantive way their obligations and take up their commitments” and that, “on the Chinese side, the Chinese government would make its own decision after making some assessments of the implementation by other countries.”<SUP><A href=""#FOOT21"" name=""REF21"">21</A></SUP> In this statement, Xie was signaling that China was waiting to see whether the developed countries would follow through on their UNFCCC obligations to lead them in taking on mitigation commitments. This position was reinforced recently by Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi, who said in September that developed countries should “continue to take the lead in reducing emissions after 2012.”<SUP><A href=""#FOOT22"" name=""REF22"">22</A></SUP></P><P>Despite the EU’s willingness to commit to post-2012 emissions reduction targets, the absence of international commitments by the United States, the <STRONG>[End Page 162]</STRONG> world’s largest industrialized-country emitter, provides the best excuse for China not to have to adopt commitments. Even as China’s emissions surpass those of the United States on an annual basis, it will be decades before Chinese emissions surpass U.S. emissions on a cumulative basis, measured as historic contribution of emissions to the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere for a century or more, so it is really the buildup of gases over time that is important from a scientific perspective. As previously mentioned, China’s per capita greenhouse gas emissions would have to quintuple to equal those of the United States.</P><P>Consequently, if the United States were to take on credible international <mark>climate change</mark> commitments, China would face renewed pressure to revisit its delay tactics. Another key dynamic that could shift in the near term is the G-77 negotiating block. Countries within the G-77 are beginning to diverge somewhat in their positions, which could leave China in a more isolated negotiating position. Some tropical forest countries, including Brazil and a coalition of 32 rain forest countries including Costa Rica and Papua New Guinea, have stated a willingness to take on voluntary avoided-deforestation targets in return for compensation.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT23"" name=""REF23"">23</A></SUP> Historically, voluntary international targets of any form have not been part of the G-77 position.</P><P class=""sec-headB""><STRONG>Capitalizing on the Clean Development Mechanism</STRONG></P><P>{C}{C}{C}China has ratified the primary international accords on <mark>climate change</mark>—the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol—but as a developing country, China has no binding emissions limits under either accord. It is, however, an active participant in the CDM established under the protocol, which grants emissions credits for verified reductions in developing countries, which can be used by developing countries toward meeting their Kyoto targets. The Kyoto Protocol requires developing countries to implement measures to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark> as is feasible for them, “in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.”<SUP><A href=""#FOOT24"" name=""REF24"">24</A></SUP></P><P>The Chinese government has historically approached the CDM somewhat more cautiously and has taken a more involved role in the project approval process than other developing countries, getting China off to a relatively late start in the <mark>carbon</mark> market. Although CDM projects became eligible for crediting in 2000 (five years before the Kyoto Protocol entered into force), China did not ratify the treaty until August 2002, its designated national authority <STRONG>[End Page 163]</STRONG> overseeing CDM projects was not established until June 2004, and the State Council did not adopt rules for the management of CDM projects until October 2005.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT25"" name=""REF25"">25</A></SUP></P><P>China has been consistent in its position that, as a developing country, it will not take on any binding international commitments to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Some of China’s hesitance to make international commitments stems from reasonable concerns about energy data quality and transparency. In developing countries, where resource constraints result in limited data quality, inventories of national greenhouse gas emissions are notoriously inexact.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT26"" name=""REF26"">26</A></SUP> Having in place a national emissions inventory system will likely be a crucial step in enabling the adoption and enforcement of any binding emissions reduction policies, whether enacted nationally or internationally.</P><P>Another reason for China’s hesitance stems from broader concerns about the role of international actors in China. China was initially skeptical about the introduction of the Kyoto mechanisms under the UNFCCC, not only viewing the CDM as a way for developed countries to avoid their own responsibilities to reduce emissions but also expressing concern about the potential for foreign exploitation of rights to ownership of emissions credits.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT27"" name=""REF27"">27</A></SUP> China has long had protectionist tendencies and resisted foreign involvement in various sectors and activities, particularly industries deemed to have an impact on national economic security.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT28"" name=""REF28"">28</A></SUP> Recent examples include reported preferences for locally manufactured products and differential treatment given to foreign competitors in industrial sectors throughout the economy.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT29"" name=""REF29"">29</A></SUP></P><P>Such policies exist in many sectors, including several in low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy technology. For example, all wind turbines erected are subject to a 70 percent local content requirement, a policy which discourages the sale of foreign wind turbines not sourced in China.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT30"" name=""REF30"">30</A></SUP> Many of these policies are in place to encourage technology transfer in the form of licensing intellectual property rights by foreign companies to Chinese companies. Expectations of such transfers, however, are rarely met without additional incentives. For example, GE transferred its 9FA gas turbine combined-cycle technology to a Chinese company via a majority-owned joint venture, in return for a $900 million contract to sell these turbines in China.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT31"" name=""REF31"">31</A></SUP> Despite enduring restrictions on foreign investment and ownership, calls for international technology transfer from Chinese officials are consistent, in and out of the <mark>climate</mark> and energy context.</P><P>China’s position toward the CDM has changed dramatically in recent years, however, as China has begun to realize the economic and political benefits <STRONG>[End Page 164]</STRONG> that the CDM could provide. The CDM has become a vehicle for China to help stimulate investment in projects that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and to help cover the incremental cost of higher-efficiency or low-<mark>carbon</mark> technology. Another benefit of China’s leadership in the CDM is that it provides a way in which China can be viewed internationally as being proactive on the <mark>climate</mark> issue. Now the world leader in terms of CDM-induced greenhouse gas reduction credits in the CDM pipeline, China has learned how to use the CDM to its advantage.</P><P>Concerns about foreign involvement in Chinese efforts have not waned. These rules governing the CDM in China are viewed as “carefully crafted … to heavily favor Chinese interests and control, and to ensure Chinese ‘resources’ are protected” and have become a cause for complaint by many potential foreign investors, particularly the stipulation that only majority-owned Chinese enterprises may serve as project owners.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT32"" name=""REF32"">32</A></SUP></P><P>Despite these restrictions and complaints, China has emerged as the leading CDM host country, with about 1.2 billion tons of CO<SUB>2</SUB>-equivalent credits scheduled to be issued by the end of the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period in 2012.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT33"" name=""REF33"">33</A></SUP> This means that 52 percent of total emissions reductions under the CDM are taking place in China. At a price of $10 per ton, sales of the 1.2 billion tons of reductions currently in the pipeline would represent a total investment in China of about $12 billion.</P><P class=""sec-headA""><STRONG>Options to Advance International Negotiations</STRONG></P><P>A central challenge in addressing global <mark>climate change</mark> will be arriving at multilateral arrangements that include adequate effort by all major economies to moderate and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The multilateral <mark>climate</mark> effort to date has relied on a particular form of emissions commitment: economy-wide emissions limits. Such limits for developed countries were voluntary within the UNFCCC and later binding under the Kyoto Protocol. Developing countries have historically resisted economy-wide emissions limits, however, and will likely continue to do so in any discussion or negotiation of the post-2012 <mark>climate</mark> effort. Consequently, there is a need to explore alternative approaches to engage large developing countries, such as China, in real mitigation activities in the forthcoming <mark>climate change</mark> negotiations.</P><P>For China to increase its international commitment to <mark>climate change</mark> action, its overarching concerns will need to be addressed. These include, because of its reliance on coal, the large incremental cost it faces in moving toward higher-efficiency coal technology and in capturing the emissions from these plants; concerns about energy data quality and transparency that are at the root of its hesitancy to commit to quantifiable targets; and current limitations <STRONG>[End Page 165]</STRONG> on the use of foreign investment and foreign technology to achieve its domestic development goals. Recognizing the unique challenges that China faces in addressing <mark>climate change</mark> can inform what it will be willing and able to undertake within a multilateral <mark>climate</mark> agreement. In the Chinese context, it may make sense to examine intensity targets, sectoral agreements, and policy commitments and crediting. Targeted international assistance will also be an important component of any international <mark>climate</mark> agreement.</P><P class=""sec-headB""><STRONG>Intensity versus Absolute Targets</STRONG></P><P>Developing countries, including China, view absolute greenhouse gas targets, such as those under the Kyoto Protocol, as a cap on their economic growth. Intensity-based targets, whether measured as energy intensity or greenhouse gas intensity, are based on a ratio of the amount of energy or greenhouse gas emissions per unit of economic output. Because such a target is inherently indexed to the economic growth of a country, meeting this target does not directly require a decrease in economic production to meet it. This type of target is therefore more palatable to developing countries that oppose caps on their economic growth on equity principles. Meeting this target requires countries to understand the core drivers of their emissions within their economy, while incentivizing more efficient energy consumption and eventually decoupling energy use from economic growth.</P><P>The main limitation of an intensity-based target is that, although it can lower an emissions growth trajectory below the projected business-as-usual level, it is unlikely to result in an absolute decrease in emissions. Given a constant structural mix, energy intensity declines naturally with economic growth even while absolute energy consumption continues to increase.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT34"" name=""REF34"">34</A></SUP> While the intensity of China’s <mark>carbon</mark> emissions (ratio of energy-related CO<SUB>2 </SUB>emissions to GDP) declined 67 percent between 1980 and 2000, its absolute emissions increased by 126 percent over this period.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT35"" name=""REF35"">35</A></SUP> Yet, if China’s emissions intensity had remained fixed where it was in 1980, its emissions would be more than double what they are today.</P><P class=""sec-headB""><STRONG>Sectoral versus National Focus</STRONG></P><P>Uncertainty is associated with all estimates of emissions reduction, particularly in many developing countries in which the accuracy of national greenhouse gas emissions inventories are often constrained by limited capacity for data collection and estimation. The uncertainty associated with national inventories makes it very difficult to implement greenhouse gas reduction commitments that rely on baseline inventories and aggregated annual improvements <STRONG>[End Page 166]</STRONG> at the national level. More exact estimates can be achieved, however, when estimating emissions from a smaller number of sources, such as within a sector where the sources of emissions are known and well documented. Consequently, understanding emissions sources within a particular sector could form the basis for targeted mitigation efforts within that sector, even in the absence of a broader understanding of emissions sources and trends.</P><P>Sectoral agreements have been proposed as a way of structuring multilateral commitments to adopt targets or standards around one or more sectors, possibly including developed and developing countries, potentially in concert with other commitment types, such as economy-wide targets. International sectoral agreements could provide a means of coordinating key industrial producers to develop <mark>climate change</mark> goals and a forum for sharing best practices and technological <mark>innovation</mark>s. Reduction targets or efficiency standards agreed among countries at the sectoral level could target mitigation efforts toward key greenhouse gas–generating activities and help to prevent competitive imbalances, particularly in energy-intensive industries that trade globally.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT36"" name=""REF36"">36</A></SUP> China plays an important role in many such industries. Globally, China now accounts for 48 percent of cement production, 49 percent of flat glass production, 35 percent of steel production, and 28 percent of aluminum production.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT37"" name=""REF37"">37</A></SUP></P><P>A major challenge to implementing sectoral agreements is integrating developing countries, which typically use less efficient technology and thus will bear a higher cost in meeting any sector-wide standards. In addition, if some sectors are targeted for mitigation while others are left unregulated, there may be an incentive for emissions to “leak” from one sector to another to the extent cross-sectoral substitutions are feasible.</P><P class=""sec-headB""><STRONG>Policy Commitments versus Project Activities</STRONG></P><P>Currently, 820 discrete CDM projects have been proposed in China that, if approved and implemented, could amount to 1.2 billion tons of CO<SUB>2</SUB>-equivalent emissions reductions by 2012.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT38"" name=""REF38"">38</A></SUP> Yet, China’s single national target to achieve a 20 percent reduction in energy intensity by 2010 could reduce its emissions by about 1.5 billion tons. Consequently, this policy and others in China, such as those articulated in China’s national <mark>climate change</mark> plan, could form the basis of policy-based commitments made under the UNFCCC. Such commitments could achieve more emissions reductions in the developing world than project-based <STRONG>[End Page 167]</STRONG> crediting mechanisms, such as the CDM, and potentially reduce the transactions costs associated with project-by-project verification. Policy commitments as part of a multilateral <mark>climate</mark> agreement could allow developing countries to identify ways that emissions mitigation fits or advances national priorities, such as economic growth, energy security, and public health, and would help to achieve broad participation in an international effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT39"" name=""REF39"">39</A></SUP> The stringency of policy-based commitments could evolve over time, perhaps beginning as voluntary actions reported internationally in fulfillment of existing UNFCCC commitments and then be taken as new commitments negotiated as part of a broader post-2012 agreement.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT40"" name=""REF40"">40</A></SUP></P><P>The World Bank, in developing its Investment Framework for Clean Energy and Development, concluded that an expanded <mark>carbon</mark> market backed by a global <mark>climate policy</mark> framework would be a principal source of finance for substantially de<mark>carbon</mark>izing electricity generation in the developing world.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT41"" name=""REF41"">41</A></SUP> In a post-2012 framework that includes new emissions targets for developed countries, the strongest incentive for developing countries to take on policy commitments may then be the prospect of generating marketable emissions credits. Crediting as now structured under the CDM is on a project-by-project basis. If a future framework were to incorporate policy commitments, allowing crediting on the basis of those commitments could channel investment to industry- or sector-wide strategies that could deliver reductions on a far broader scale.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT42"" name=""REF42"">42</A></SUP> Yet, policy-based crediting would face the same fundamental issues that arise in project-based crediting: how to establish that actions to be credited are additional, not business as usual, and how to verify actual emissions reductions.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT43"" name=""REF43"">43</A></SUP></P><P class=""sec-headB""><STRONG>International Assistance</STRONG></P><P>An important part of any multilateral <mark>climate</mark> deal will likely include a commitment from developed countries to increase developing country access to advanced technologies and to provide incentives and financial assistance for their mitigation and adaptation activities. China’s own <mark>climate change</mark> plan has clearly identified its priority areas for international collaboration to include cooperation on advanced coal technologies, energy-efficient building technologies, clean vehicle technology, and advanced industrial technologies. China has placed a particularly heavy emphasis on technology transfer in international <mark>climate</mark> negotiations, most recently proposing the establishment <STRONG>[End Page 168]</STRONG> of a Technology Development and Transfer Board to oversee and implement technology transfer–related activities, as well as a Multilateral Technology Acquisition Fund to support the “development, deployment, diffusion and transfer of technologies to developing countries, through, inter alia, the buying out of intellectual property rights.”<SUP><A href=""#FOOT44"" name=""REF44"">44</A></SUP></P><P>Increased attention to developing these technologies and increased experience deploying them is important not only for China but also for the rest of the world. The United States and China in particular share a common interest in determining a way to continue their reliance on coal while moving toward more efficient coal-combustion and gasification technologies and capturing and storing the emissions from coal power plants. Increased bilateral assistance in this area can complement and even facilitate multilateral <mark>climate</mark> negotiations.</P><P class=""sec-headA""><STRONG>Engaging China on <mark>Climate</mark></STRONG></P><P>China will face increasing international pressure in the coming months to devote more attention to <mark>climate change</mark>, both due to its emergence as the largest global emitter and as international attention to <mark>climate change</mark> is elevated by government leaders and heads of state in high-profile forums around the world. A series of such discussions on <mark>climate change</mark> have already been held in 2007, including the June Group of Eight summit in Heiligendamm; the August UN intersessional in Vienna; the September Gleneagles Dialogue in Berlin; the September Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Sydney; and the UN secretary-general’s high-level <mark>climate</mark> summit in New York, preceding the General Assembly in late September, followed later that week by the major economies summit hosted by the U.S. government. This year’s meetings culminate in December when ministers and delegates will be joined by stakeholders from around the world for the thirteenth Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 13) and the third Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in Bali, Indonesia.</P><P>The primary objective of most countries attending the Bali meeting, as has been discussed at these preceding sessions, is to establish a road map for the forthcoming negotiations of the agreement that will follow the Kyoto Protocol, whose current commitment period ends in 2012. Several governments have articulated that, to maintain progress toward meeting needed global emissions reductions and to maintain a steady global <mark>carbon</mark> market, a decision on a future framework will need to be reached by COP 15, set for 2009 in Copenhagen.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT45"" name=""REF45"">45</A></SUP> At the moment, such an agreement hinges on increased engagement from the United States; increased action from the major developing economies, particularly China; and a new <mark>climate</mark> framework that allows for <STRONG>[End Page 169]</STRONG> different forms of commitments to be taken by different countries. Although it is impossible to predict what a dynamic country such as China will eventually deem to be an acceptable form of international <mark>climate</mark> action, many of the options discussed above are very likely being explored and evaluated by all of the major economies.</P><P>China must play a central role in any global solution to address <mark>climate change</mark>. Yet, it is also home to 1.3 billion inhabitants that desire the modern energy services and consumption habits enjoyed by much of the developed world. Recent institutional changes and renewed attention to implementing aggressive energy efficiency policies demonstrate the Chinese government’s increasing awareness of the problems posed by <mark>climate change</mark> and its interest in altering China’s current energy development trajectory.</P><P>Many actors throughout China, in and out of government, have a strong desire to achieve international standards, be they for free trade or intellectual property rights protection, which lend legitimacy to often-strained central government implementation of mandates at the local level. In addition, China’s economic development is increasingly dependent on the global integration of its energy system, such that it cannot allow itself to become technologically or institutionally isolated on the <mark>climate</mark> issue.<SUP><A href=""#FOOT46"" name=""REF46"">46</A></SUP> Yet, the government will not likely be able to significantly alter its current energy development trajectory without meaningful international engagement during the next one to two decades, a period during which China’s energy infrastructure investment decisions will have direct implications for the future stability of the global <mark>climate</mark> system.</P><P>There is new urgency, as well as opportunity, for each of the major economies to jointly examine and address linkages among their own economic development, their energy security, and their role in global <mark>climate change</mark>. Effective engagement with Beijing will only be possible if the major emitting developed countries lead by example, and serious U.S. engagement will likely be a precondition to China’s engagement in any international <mark>climate</mark> effort. Meanwhile, understanding the challenges that China faces in reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions in the years ahead, particularly in de<mark>carbon</mark>izing its energy sector, is the first step to engaging China on <mark>climate</mark> cooperation.</P><P><SPAN class=""fn-head""><STRONG>Notes </STRONG></SPAN></P><P><A href=""#REF1"" name=""FOOT1"">1</A>.

			Opinion: Mother’s Day is an opportunity to step into action		</SPAN></A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE>But before making California an enthusiastic partner of China on <mark>climate</mark> action, Brown must address the significant <mark>climate</mark> impact of China’s foreign investments and of California’s contributions to those impacts.<P>That’s because Chinese funding of fossil fuel infrastructure in the Amazon, and California’s imports of much of that oil, generate a triple <mark>carbon</mark> impact: from the burning of the oil, the emissions released when cutting down the rainforest, and the destruction of the world’s largest <mark>carbon</mark> sink.</P><P>The Amazon rainforest is one of the most biologically diverse regions of the world. It’s essential to preserve in order to combat <mark>climate change</mark>. Yet today, Ecuador is opening up new, pristine Amazon indigenous rainforest territory to oil drilling, funded and propelled by China. And, though it seems counterintuitive, much of Ecuador’s oil ends up in California.</P><P>Chinese development banks and state-run companies have invested heavily across Latin America, including in Ecuador, in the past several years. Since 2010, the China Development Bank and China Export-Import Bank have provided $15.2 billion in loans.</P><P>Many of these loans must be paid by the sale of oil or fuel from Ecuador’s state-run Petroecuador to China’s state-run PetroChina International. After the recent collapse of crude prices, Ecuador must now drill even more oil to service its debt. Chinese investment is thus driving a new and destructive oil boom in the Amazon rainforests of Ecuador.</P><P>Instead of going to China, however, roughly 60 percent of Ecuador’s Amazon crude makes its way to the US, and more than half of that to California. It is processed in California refineries and sold throughout the state, as Amazon Watch revealed in a 2016 study.</P><P>California ranks third in the nation for refining capacity and, in 2016, about 10 percent of its fuel stock came from the Western Amazon. In fact, Ecuador ranks second only to Saudi Arabia in supplying crude oil to these refineries.</P><P>The impacts of drilling in the Amazon rainforest are dire both for its world-renowned biodiversity – areas of Ecuador’s Amazon boast some of the highest rates of species diversity and endemism in the world – and its indigenous peoples, many of whom have long rejected controversial drilling plans on their lands.</P><P>These forests and people already suffered through the world’s largest environmental disaster in history due to previous oil drilling by companies like Texaco (now Chevron) and state-run oil companies. The risks that the Amazon rainforest and its indigenous protectors face cannot be ignored if Brown and China truly want to prevent <mark>climate</mark> catastrophe.</P><P>As long as the current U.S. administration will not provide leadership on <mark>climate</mark>, it is important for California to look elsewhere for willing and able partners. But the state must assess the full <mark>climate</mark> impacts of its own supply chains, and assure that its partners do, in fact, have a commitment to global <mark>climate</mark> leadership.</P><P>With so much Amazon crude coming to California, spurred by Chinese investments, Brown has an incredible opportunity to contribute to the protection of the Amazon rainforest and to triple the reduction of California’s <mark>climate</mark> impact. He can act to end Amazon crude. We hope he will seize this opportunity.</P><P><EM>Leila Salazar-López is  Executive Director of Oakland-based Amazon Watch, which works to defend indigenous rights, protect the rainforest and the <mark>climate</mark>.

Heede concludes that nearly two-thirds of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emitted since the 1750s can be traced to the 90 largest fossil fuel and cement producers, most of which still operate. online</P><P>The research attributes 63 percent of the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and methane emitted between 1751 and 2010 to just 90 entities. Fifty are investor-owned companies such as Chevron, Peabody, Shell, and BHP Billiton. Thirty-one are state-owned companies such as Saudi Aramco and Statoil, and nine are government-run industries in countries such as China, Poland, and the former Soviet Union. The research also classified the 90 entities according to type of fossil fuel extracted and marketed.</P><P>There are 56 oil and natural gas companies, and 37 coal producers. In addition, the <mark>CO2</mark> emissions from seven cement manufacturers are included.</P><P><STRONG>Top 20 investor- and state-owned entities and attributed <mark>CO2</mark> &amp; CH4 emissions 2010</STRONG></P><TABLE border=""2"" cellspacing=""5px"" cellpadding=""5px""><TBODY><TR><TD valign=""middle""><B>Entity</B></TD></TR><TR><TD valign=""middle"">3.

State-owned companies contributed 288 gigatonnes.</P><P>The largest investor-owned producers have had an outsize effect on emissions. The top 20 produced fuels that comprised 29.5 percent of emissions, while the top 10 account for 15.8 percent.</P><P>Half the emissions traced to the 90 “<mark>carbon</mark> majors” have occurred since 1986, demonstrating the increasing speed with which fossil fuels are being burned.</P><P><B>METHODS SUMMARY</B></P><P>Heede spent eight years combing through publicly available records including annual reports in the collections of public and academic libraries, filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and other public sources. He collected data on crude oil, natural gas, coal, and cement production worldwide by three types of entities: investor-owned (e.g. ExxonMobil), state-owned (e.g. Saudi Aramco) and government-run entities (e.g. North Korea’s coal industry).</P><P>The availability of production data for each entity and the timing of Heede’s research dictated the dominant timeframe (1854-2010) for this study. The threshold for inclusion was at least 8 million tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> (MtC) produced in a recent year, which focused attention on a manageable number of entities and highlighted those companies responsible for most of the current warming.</P><P>When an entity merged or was acquired, its emissions prior to that point were attributed to the extant entity. To accurately account for <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions, all non-combustion uses of hydro<mark>carbon</mark>, such as oil used for petrochemicals, lubricants, and asphalt were subtracted and the amount of CO<SUB>2 </SUB>each fuel type releases upon combustion calculated. To ensure conversion rates were standardized, the analysis relied on international guidelines for <mark>carbon</mark> content of all fuel types.</P><P>The analysis also included calculations of a producer’s direct emissions via flaring and venting processes, emissions from entities using their own fuel, and fugitive emissions of methane from oil and gas operations and coal mining.</P><P><B>IMPLICATIONS</B></P><P>It’s difficult for researchers to find complete extraction records, so there are advantages to greater corporate and government transparency requirements, including more thorough assessments of direct and product-related emissions.</P><P>In addition to further analysis that can be conducted through the dataset itself, the approach — looking at producers rather than nations — opens many doors for future research. Scientists running <mark>climate</mark> models, for instance, could use this data to determine how different effects of <mark>climate change</mark> can be attributed to the 90 entities in the study.</P><P>The results may also have practical policy applications. The United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, the primary forum for international <mark>climate</mark> discussions, typically focuses on responsibility at the country level. This research provides another lens to examine global <mark>climate policy</mark> because it offers the first comprehensive accounting of historical emissions from producers, including many multinational institutions that initially extracted fuels from the earth.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV><DIV id=""secondary"" class=""widget-area"" role=""complementary""><DIV id=""widgetsearch""><P>Looking for something particular?</P></DIV><DIV id=""sidesocial""><DIV id=""sidenewsletter""><P>Sign up for our newsletter, and we will keep you posted on developments.</P></DIV><DIV id=""sidefbtwit""><P>Follow us: Facebook or Twitter</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER id=""colophon"" class=""site-footer"" role=""contentinfo""><DIV id=""insidefooter""><DIV class=""site-info"">

Yet each individual nation’s efforts are too small to “solve” the problem, so it has only weak incentives to take costly mitigation actions, and strong incentives to “free ride” on the benefits of emission reductions by other countries.</P><P>From this perspective, President-elect Trump’s pledges to <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/us/politics/donald-trump-<mark>climate</mark>-change.html"">“cancel” the Paris Agreement</A> and <A href=""https://theconversation.com/what-president-trump-means-for-the-future-of-energy-and-<mark>climate</mark>-68045"">dismantle President Obama’s <mark>carbon</mark> mitigation initiatives</A> follow standard economic logic.

What is most important now—in advance of the Paris Agreement signing—is holding the Obama Administration accountable to the lessons learned from the fallout of Kyoto.</B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>Let us not forget, the Kyoto Protocol, which was a legally binding treaty as opposed to the non-binding Paris Agreement, was signed by the Clinton Administration in late 1998, but was never submitted to the U.S. Senate for ratification. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>This was because the Senate had already voted, 95 to 0, to approve the Byrd-Hagel resolution, which warned the president against signing a <mark>climate</mark> treaty that would either economically harm the U.S. or exempt developing countries from participating. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>In 2001, the U.S. formally rejected the Kyoto Protocol and looking back on Kyoto’s track record that is a very good thing. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>Ultimately, 36 developed countries were legally bound to its GHG targets and 17 – nearly half – of them failed to meet their GHG targets. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>Some countries joining Kyoto, like </B><B>Iceland, had targets that actually granted increases in GHG emissions while others, like Russia, had a target of zero – requiring them to do nothing. The same goes for Russia today with the Paris agreement.  Russia pledged to reduce its <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by 30 percent, but made their promise based off emission levels from 1990 – not their current emission levels today.  By playing with numbers, Russia’s commitment will actually allow it to increase emissions over the next few years. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>Others including Japan—the host country for signing Kyoto— significantly missed its GHG reduction targets and instead increased emissions. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>There were warning signs countries would fail to meet the Kyoto targets.  </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>For example, in 2005, the year Kyoto went into force, as then-Chairman of EPW Committee, I held a hearing on Kyoto where I questioned then-U.S. Senior <mark>Climate Change</mark> Negotiator Harlan Watson about EU countries meeting their targets. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B><A href=""https://www.epw.senate.gov/109th/Watson_Testimony.pdf"">Watson testified</A> that at the time only two EU countries – the UK and Sweden – were on track to reaching their targets. Watson also noted that at least 15 of the then-25 members of the EU had actually increased their emissions since signing onto Kyoto. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B><A href=""https://www.epw.senate.gov/109th/Thorning_testimony.pdf"">Another witness</A>, Dr. Margo Thorning of the American Council for Capital Formation, told the Committee, EU “policymakers are beginning to worry about the additional steps required to meet the targets.” </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>We now know that they were right.  The EU, one of the staunchest advocates for global GHG emission cuts, barely reached half of its required GHG targets under Kyoto.</B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>If developed countries, like those in the EU have ignored <I>legally binding</I> GHG emission targets in Kyoto, it’s highly likely they will not meet the <I>voluntary</I> GHG reductions promised in Paris. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>Within the EU, some individual countries such as Poland have already shown fierce opposition to the Paris Agreement due to their reliance on coal power. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>Some have said Paris is different because developing countries like China agreed to GHG targets.  However, the devil is in the details. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>China’s <mark>climate change</mark> commitment to peak their emissions by 2030 is a business as usual scenario and therefore they won’t have to take any serious action to reduce emissions. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>Furthermore, after making their pledge, <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/world/asia/china-burns-much-more-coal-than-reported-complicating-<mark>climate</mark>-talks.html?_r=0""><I>The New York Times</I></A> uncovered that China dramatically underreported the amount of coal it burns per year – burning 17 percent more than what China had previously reported during <mark>climate</mark> talks. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>Just last month, a <A href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/publication/chinas-changing-economy/"">London School of Economics and Political Science researcher</A> found that it is possible that Chinese emissions have already peaked. It’s no wonder when the country is bringing online a new coal power plant every 10 days.</B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>Now why would China bother putting forth such a commitment and why would the Obama Administration promote it as historic? </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>First, it is in the interest of China to ensure this commitment is ratified since it makes it more difficult for the U.S. and EU to get out of economically damaging regulations that limit our energy use. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>Second, it is in the interest of President Obama to sign this agreement since his own legacy hinges of its ratification. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>We’ve seen this before.  Think back to Kyoto.  Clinton did not have the support of the Senate.  Yet, Clinton delegated his UN Ambassador to sign it. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>And we know what happened – they signed it and so did many other countries, but the difference between the signatories is that U.S. signature means nothing without Senate ratification.  That was true then and it is still true today. </B></P><P><B>The Obama Administration should take note.  History repeats itself.  If Secretary Kerry signs the Paris Agreement, as we all expect him to do so, it will be an act in defiance of lessons from the past and in defiance of the best interests’ of the American people - all while achieving no meaningful impact on global temperatures. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>Just like Koyto, countries will not comply.  Here at home, the president’s means to force the U.S. to achieve his 26-28% emission reduction pledge–primarily through the so-called Clean Power Plan which is likely to get struck by the courts and its implementation has already been blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>Even before the Supreme Court stay of the Clean Power Plan, the president was short of meeting 40% of his pledge.  Without the Clean Power Plan, the U.S. will fall short by 60% of President Obama’s pledge. </B></P><P><B> </B></P><P><B>As the world closes the books on another failed <mark>climate</mark> deal this Friday in New York, the only achievement that President Obama and his liberal allies will be able to point to is the massive <mark>carbon</mark> footprint left behind from their government-funded planes used to travel to numerous <mark>climate</mark> negotiations that all amounted to a hollow deal to bolster the president’s legacy.</B></P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
