While <mark>climate</mark> in our region has always been highly variable at annual, decadal, century, and longer time scales, the rate of recent change is unusually rapid. It is also consistent with the well-understood physical effects of the increasing accumulations of greenhouse gases, including <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, in the atmosphere. While there has been no study specifically investigating whether the recent warming trends in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming can be attributed to greenhouse gases, such attribution has been made at the continental (western North America) and global scales. It is reasonable to conclude that a substantial fraction of the recent warming in our region is due to anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>It is less clear whether the persistent drought conditions in our region since 2000 are related to anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>. The variations since 2000 in precipitation—the main driver of drought conditions—are consistent with the natural variability seen in <A href=""observed.html""> long-term observed <mark>climate</mark></A> and<A href=""paleo.html""> paleo<mark>climate</mark> records</A>. However, the observed warming may have increased the severity of drought and exacerbated drought impacts, such as low streamflows.</P><H3>Projections of Future <mark>Climate</mark></H3><P>Global <mark>Climate</mark> Models (GCMs) are highly sophisticated computer representations of the global <mark>climate</mark> system—the atmosphere, the oceans, ice sheets and sea ice, and the land surface—based on both physical laws and <EM>parameters</EM> derived from observation. GCMs are the principal tools used by <mark>climate</mark> scientists to diagnose the causes of <mark>climate</mark> variability and to make projections of future <mark>climate</mark>, given the potential trajectories (or scenarios) for greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations. (The word <EM>projection</EM> is used instead of <EM>forecast</EM> to indicate that the model output depends on these assumptions about future greenhouse gas concentrations.)</P><P>The consensus of projections from about 35 different GCMs  compiled for the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (2013) is that the Intermountain West will warm by +2°F to +6.5°F by mid-century, relative to the 1971–2000 baseline.  The range of projections reflects both the different greenhouse gas emission scenarios and differences among the models in how future <mark>climate</mark> will unfold under a given emissions scenarios. The projections show summers warming more than winters, and typical summer temperatures by 2050 will be as warm as or warmer than the hottest 10% of summers that occurred in the 20th century. Temperature regimes will effectively shift upslope and northwards as the <mark>climate</mark> warms. </P><P>The individual GCM projections have less agreement about whether average annual  precipitation will increase or decrease in our region by 2050. The multi-model average shows little change in annual mean precipitation by 2050, though with a slight tendency towards drying in the southern part of the region, and wetter conditions in the northern part of the region. The models also suggest a seasonal shift in precipitation, with the combined effects of a northward-shifting storm track, potentially wetter storms and a drying of the sub-tropical regions globally resulting in more mid-winter precipitation, and in some areas, a decrease in late spring and summer precipitation. </P><P>Together, the uncertain changes in precipitation and the more certain impacts of warming lead to a broad range of plausible futures for water  in the Intermountain West. Consistent themes  across those futures include snowmelt and runoff occurring earlier in the spring, decreased late-summer streamflows, and increased water use by crops and other vegetation.

The principal reason is that <A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/docs/WG1AR5_FAQbrochure_FINAL.pdf"" target=""_blank"">water vapor has a short cycle in the atmosphere (10 days on average)</A> before it is incorporated into weather events and falls to Earth, so it cannot build up in the atmosphere in the same way as <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide does. However, a vicious cycle exists with water vapor, in which as more CO<SUB>2</SUB> is emitted into the atmosphere and the Earth’s temperature rises, more water evaporates into the Earth’s atmosphere, which increases the temperature of the planet. The higher temperature atmosphere can then hold more water vapor than before.</P><H3>Too much of a good thing: the <mark>carbon</mark> overload</H3><P>Earth receives energy that travels from the sun in a variety of wavelengths, some of which we see as sunlight and others that are invisible to the naked eye, such as shorter- wavelength ultraviolet radiation and longer-wavelength infrared radiation.</P><P><A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf"">As this energy passes through Earth’s atmosphere, some is reflected back into space by clouds and small particles such as sulfates; some is reflected by Earth’s surface; and some is absorbed</A> into the atmosphere by substances such as soot, stratospheric ozone, and water vapor (See yellow arrows in Figure 2 for relative proportions).

The Denver entry  reads, “In some iterations of this list, with different factors weighted  differently, Denver took the number 1 spot.”</SPAN></P><P>Journalist  Michele Berger created the <mark>Climate</mark> Disruption Index, which was used to  create the the Weather Channel list, by assigning values to six aspects  of <mark>climate change</mark> — sea level rise, extreme precipitation, extreme  drought, urban heat islands, changes in precipitation and temperature —  based on advice from scientists Katherine Hayhoe, Michael Mann and David  Easterling.</P><P>Colorado  is expected to get hotter, springs will thaw sooner and summers will  stretch on longer. This could make wildfires worse, exacerbate droughts  and shorten the ski season. But what is it that put Denver ahead of St.  Louis, Missouri; Miami, Florida; and Anchorage, Alaska?</P><P>Mainly,  the urban heat island effect, Berger says. Urban heat islands result  when a cluster of buildings, roads and infrastructure in the form of a  city is measurably hotter than surrounding areas where blacktop hasn’t  replaced vegetation.</P><P>The  list proclaims that Denver can get 23 degrees hotter than nearby rural  areas. This is based on a <mark>Climate</mark> Central report, which found that in  the worst-case scenario, Denver and its neighbors could experience a  temperature difference as extreme as night and day. The average  difference, a more modest 4.9 degrees, still put Denver third in the  nation for cities affected by summer urban heat islands.</P><P>The intense difference begs the question: what nearby areas are that much cooler?</P><P><mark>Climate</mark>  Central pitted each city against three rural counterparts, making sure  they were within about 150 miles of the city station, had the same  habitat type and were sparsely populated enough to be considered rural.</P><P>For  Denver this entailed two locations in Colorado and one in Wyoming.  Colorado’s Saguache and Cheesman stations are at elevations of 7,700 and  6,880 feet respectively. Cheesman has the added cooling factor of being  next to a lake. The Chugwater, Wyoming station is close to Denver’s  elevation, but it’s 145 miles north.</P><P>These  locations shed light on the drastic temperature difference, but may not  paint the whole picture by faulting the urban heat island alone.</P><P>“I  do acknowledge that there are definitely, I wouldn’t say flaws, but  that the list is not perfect,” Berger says, “that it’s a work in  progress and that everything is going to change as soon as we have more  data.”</P><P>In an interview  with the Weather Channel, Hayhoe and Mann said that how people value  different factors easily changes the list. With urban heat islands and  extreme weather as more significant factors, Denver topped the list.  Once sea level rise became the most heavily weighted factor, New Orleans  took the lead. Hayhoe argued that sea level rise was more important  because no one can live underwater.</P><P>“We  weren’t trying to create this comprehensive list,” Berger says. “We  basically just wanted to spur conversation about a topic that we feel is  really important.”</P><P>So let’s converse about what <mark>climate change</mark> will actually mean for Colorado.</P><P>The  state of Colorado acknowledged the reality of <mark>climate change</mark> in a 2013  House bill that required annual reports about what <mark>climate change</mark> will  mean for the state and  how to combat it. As a major hub of scientific information, Boulder’s  labs and researchers were more than prepared to comply.</P><P>The  Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the  University of Colorado Boulder published the 2014 report, <EM><mark>Climate Change</mark> in Colorado, </EM>and together CU Boulder and Colorado State University published the 2015 study, <EM>Colorado <mark>Climate Change</mark> Vulnerability Study.</EM></P><P>Eric  Gordon, managing director for Western Water Assessment at CU and  co-lead author of the 2015 study, says that if you want to know what  <mark>climate change</mark> will mean for you, you need information specific to where  you are.</P><P>“If you were  to look at the United States as a whole you would see trends that  really don’t apply to the state of Colorado,” Gordon says. “There are  important unique factors about where we are — our midcontinental  location, our low humidity, the fact that the mountains are a major  driver of the dynamics of the weather out here — that aren’t picked up  in many of these other reports.”</P><P>So  far, in the last 30 years, Colorado has warmed by 2 degrees and spring  snowmelt has shifted one to four weeks earlier. As far as what to  expect, there are a few things we can say are happening with relative  confidence.</P><P>By 2050 we  can expect average temperatures to be 2.5 to 5 degrees hotter, summers  should be warmer and longer, and winters will likely be wetter,  according to the 2014 report. Models have reached a consensus on these aspects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“It’s  comforting when you see the same results repeating with slightly  different sets of data [and] new model projections,” says Jeff Lukas,  co-lead author for both <EM><mark>Climate Change</mark> in Colorado </EM>and the <EM>Colorado <mark>Climate Change</mark> Vulnerability Study. </EM>“We  say ‘OK, we’re getting stable messages from the state of the art  <mark>climate</mark> science with respect to what we should expect in the future.’” </P><P> Warmer temperatures bringing earlier springs, which mean shorter ski  seasons and longer growing seasons. The spring pulse, caused by melting  snow, will occur earlier in the year. So anyone or anything using that  water, from farmers irrigating crops to fish living in streams, will  have to adjust.</P><P>“You’ve  got this longer growing season, which sounds like a good thing on  paper, but will there be the water, both irrigation water and natural  precipitation, to support the vegetation that grows?” Lukas asks.</P><P>Colorado’s  river systems are largely dependent on melting snow. If all the snow  melts away earlier in spring, there will be little water left by the dog  days of summer. The problem is compounded by the fact that plants, just  like people, need more water in warmer temperatures.</P><P>“In  a way you could say that plants sweat,” Lukas says. “[They] release  water for different reasons physiologically, but as it gets hotter you  need to take in more water as an organism to replace the water that’s  being released into the atmosphere.”</P><P>So  when the ski slopes melt down the mountains sooner in spring, we must  find a way to store enough to last the longer summer and to compensate  for the increased need of our heat strained plants.</P><P>“It  can be a little challenging to get a hard grasp on exactly how much  water we’re going to have available in the future,” Gordon says. “But  what we definitely don’t want to do is get ourselves in a situation  where we are blindsided and we have demands far outstripping available  supplies and the best way to [avoid that] is to think about it and also  to coordinate.”</P><P>He  suggests municipalities band together to plan, be aware of the range of  vulnerabilities and back each other up in emergencies.</P><P>Running low on water threatens more than our crops and our taps. If we’re hot and dry, forests are too, and that means wildfire.</P><P>“We  will have a tendency to have more wildfire,” Lukas says. “We’ve seen  that historically those years where we have warmer springs and earlier  snowmelt, you tend to get more fire.</P><P>“It  has sort of a cascading effect throughout the whole summer season, into  the fall even, for both water and our overall landscapes when we have  earlier springs,” he says.</P><P>There’s  less consensus about the future of precipitation in Colorado because  it’s based on more variable systems including jet streams, the North  American monsoon season and complexities of mountain weather patterns.</P><P>“We’re  somewhere in that no man’s land between more clearly expecting wetter  and more clearly expecting drier futures,” Lukas says.</P><P>In the northern half of the West, the future looks like rain, while the southern half is predicted to have drier skies.</P><P>“We  will probably see a shift in precipitation toward wetter winters and  drier summers,” Gordon says. “That’s probably the area of precipitation  where we have the most confidence.”</P><P>Beyond agriculture, fire and an uncertain water future, <mark>climate change</mark> poses problems for energy use and Coloradans themselves.</P><P>Energy  and <mark>climate change</mark> clash on multiple fronts. The increasing heat from  <mark>climate change</mark> prompts Coloradans to crank up their air conditioners.  This puts additional strain on electric utilities when they’re already  the most taxed — in summer — which is primarily because of our addiction  to air condition.</P><P>Fossil  fuels make up 85 percent of Colorado’s electricity generation,  according to the Energy Information Administration. Calling on more  electricity to stay cool means burning more fossil fuels, which  contributes to <mark>climate change</mark> causing more heating. It’s a  self-perpetuating loop. </P><P>Gordon, whose work focused on vulnerabilities,  says, “The question we really asked was, ‘Where is the intersection  between where the physical changes in our <mark>climate</mark> will affect the state  and where we are least prepared to adapt to them?’” </P><P>He says elements  that affect the economy, like agriculture and recreation, tend to stand  out, but the report also outlines <mark>climate change</mark>’s threats to land,  water, agriculture, energy, transportation, outdoor recreation and  public health.</P><P>“As we  kind of go down the line of impacts and vulnerabilities, there’s some  obvious consequences to that, like people being exposed to daytime hot  temperatures probably becomes much more of an issue,” Gordon says.</P><P>He  put specific emphasis on outdoor workers, like construction and highway  workers toiling in the sun; the elderly, who are more susceptible to  heat-related injury and often have no one making sure they have a chance  to cool down; and children and teachers in older classrooms without air  conditioning.</P><P>Both Gordon and Lukas emphasize that being aware of what’s coming and preparing for it are the best things we can do.</P><P>“The  prudent thing to say would be, ‘Well, what if a 2002-type drought were  to happen again? What if a 2013-type flood were to happen again?’”  Gordon says. “And then maybe you could say, ‘OK, well maybe <mark>climate</mark>  change will juice these a little bit more — are we capable of handling  that kind of thing?’” </P><P>Lukas says there are two sides of the “what do we  do” coin. The first is mitigation. By reducing the  amount of greenhouse gases we release into the atmosphere, we reduce  future effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“The  second part is adaptation,” Lukas says. “How do we adapt to the changes  that are inevitable because we’ve already baked in a fair amount of  warming to the atmosphere? Depending on what policy choices we make with  respect to future <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, we may have more or less impact to  deal with, but we’re gonna have some, we know that.”</P><P><EM>Respond: info@boulderganic.com</EM></P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

During these years, annual flows in the Colorado River averaged 19 percent below the 20th-century average. </P><P>During a similar 15-year drought in the 1950s, annual flows declined by 18 percent. But during that drought, the region was drier: rainfall decreased by about 6 percent, compared to 4.5 percent between 2000 and 2014. Why, then, is the recent drought the most severe on record? </P><P>The answer is simple: higher temperatures. From 2000 to 2014, temperatures in the Upper Basin, where most of the runoff that feeds the Colorado River is produced, were 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the 20th-century average. This is why we call this event a hot drought. High temperatures continued in 2015 and 2016, as did less-than-average flows. Runoff in 2017 is expected to be above average, but this will only modestly improve reservoir volumes.</P><P>High temperatures affect river levels in many ways. Coupled with earlier snow melt, they lead to a longer growing season, which means more days of water demand from plants. Higher temperatures also increase daily plant water use and evaporation from water bodies and soils. In sum, as it warms, the atmosphere <A href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2009JCLI2905.1"">draws more water</A>, up to 4 percent more per degree Fahrenheit from all available sources, so less water flows into the river. These findings also apply to all semi-arid rivers in the American Southwest, especially <A href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017GL073253"">the Rio Grande</A>. </P><FIGURE class=""align-center ""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">The combined contents of the nation’s two largest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, since their initial fillings.

Temperature projections from <mark>climate</mark> models are <A href=""http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/pd/<mark>climate</mark>/factsheets/howreliable.pdf"">robust scientific findings based on well-tested physics</A>. In the Colorado River Basin, temperatures are projected to warm by 5°F, compared to the 20th-century average, by midcentury in scenarios that assume either modest or high greenhouse gas emissions. By the end of this century, the region would be 9.5°F warmer if global greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced.</P><P>Using simple but strong relationships derived from hydrology models, which were buttressed by observations, we and our colleagues calculated how river flows are affected by higher temperatures. We found that Colorado River flows decline by about <A href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00228.1"">4 percent per degree Fahrenheit increase</A>, which is roughly the same amount as the increased atmospheric water vapor holding capacity discussed above. Thus, warming could reduce water flow in the Colorado by 20 percent or more below the 20th-century average by midcentury, and by as much as 40 percent by the end of the century. Emission reductions could ease the magnitude of warming by 2100 from 9.5°F to 6.5°F, which would reduce river flow by approximately 25 percent.</P><P>Large precipitation increases could counteract the declines that these all-but-certain future temperature increases will cause. But for that to happen, precipitation would have to increase by an average of 8 percent at midcentury and 15 percent by 2100. </P><FIGURE class=""align-center ""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">The American Canal carries water from the Colorado River to farms in California’s Imperial Valley.</SPAN><SPAN class=""attribution""><A class=""source"" href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/FEMA_-_44635_-_American_Canal_in_California.jpg"">Adam Dubrowa, FEMA/Wikipedia</A></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>On a year-in, year-out basis, these large increases would be substantial. The largest decade-long increases in precipitation in the 20th century were 8 percent. When such an increase occurred over 10 years in the Colorado Basin in the 1980s, it caused large-scale flooding that <A href=""http://www.hcn.org/external_files/40years/blog/WaterPolicyChaosArticle.pdf"">threatened the structural stability of Glen Canyon Dam</A>, due to a spillway failure not unlike <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oroville_Dam_crisis"">the recent collapse at California’s Oroville Dam</A>. </P><P>For several reasons, we think these large precipitation increases will not occur. <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf"">The Colorado River Basin and other areas around the globe at essentially the same latitudes</A>, such as the Mediterranean region and areas of Chile, South Africa and Australia, are especially at risk for drying because they lie immediately poleward of the planet’s major deserts. <A href=""http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/13/10081/2013/"">These deserts are projected to stretch polewards</A> as the <mark>climate</mark> warms. In the Colorado River basin, dry areas to the south are expected to encroach on some of the basin’s most productive snow and runoff areas. </P><P>Moreover, <mark>climate</mark> models do not agree on whether future precipitation in the Colorado Basin will increase or decrease, let alone by how much. Rain gauge measurements indicate that there has not been any significant long-term change in precipitation in the Upper Basin of the Colorado since 1896, which makes substantial increases in the future even more doubtful.</P><P><A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/todays-drought-in-the-west-is-nothing-compared-to-what-may-be-coming/2015/02/12/0041646a-b2d9-11e4-854b-a38d13486ba1_story.html"">Megadroughts</A>, which last anywhere from 20 to 50 years or more, provide yet another reason to avoid putting too much faith in precipitation increases. We know from <A href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007GL029988"">tree-ring studies</A> going back to A.D. 800 that megadroughts have occurred previously in the basin.</P><FIGURE class=""align-center ""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""attribution""><A class=""source"" href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/styles/large/public/2016-07/southwest-download1-2016.png"">USEPA</A></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H2>Planning for lower flows</H2><P>March of 2017 was the warmest March in Colorado history, with temperatures <A href=""https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/201703"">a stunning 8.8°F above normal</A>.

He also exploits long-gone ties with Greenpeace to sell himself as a speaker and pro-corporate spokesperson, usually taking positions that Greenpeace opposes.</P></DIV><DIV class=""articleBody""><P>While it is true that Patrick Moore was a member of Greenpeace in the 1970s, in 1986 he abruptly turned his back on the very issues he once passionately defended. He claims he “saw the light” but what Moore really saw was an opportunity for financial gain. Since then he has gone from defender of the planet to a paid representative of corporate polluters.</P><P>Patrick Moore promotes such anti-environmental positions as clearcut logging, nuclear power, farmed salmon, PVC (vinyl) production, genetically engineered crops, and mining. Clients for his consulting services are a veritable Who’s Who of companies that Greenpeace has exposed for environmental misdeeds, including Monsanto, Weyerhaeuser, and BHP Minerals.</P><P>Moore’s claims run from the exaggerated to the outrageous to the downright false, including that “clear-cutting is good for forests” and Three Mile Island was actually “a success story” because the radiation from the partially melted core was contained. That is akin to saying “my car crash was a success because I only cracked my skull and didn’t die.”</P><P>By exploiting his former ties to Greenpeace, Moore portrays himself as a prodigal son who has seen the error of his ways. Unfortunately, the media – especially conservative media – give him a platform for his views, and often do so without mentioning the fact that he is a paid spokesperson for polluting companies.</P><P>The following provides a brief overview of Patrick Moore’s positions and his history of working for corporate polluters.</P><H2>TRUTH V. FICTION ON PATRICK MOORE:</H2><P>Patrick Moore claims he is an environmentalist and represents an independent scientific perspective on forest issues.</P><P><STRONG>TRUTH:</STRONG> Moore was paid by the British Columbia Forest Alliance, an industry-front group set up by the public relations firm Burson-Marsteller (the same PR firm that represented Exxon after the Valdez oil spill and Union Carbide after the Bhopal chemical disaster). The BC Forest Alliance is funded primarily by the
logging industry. He also has ties to other corporations including Monsanto and Weyerhaeuser.</P><P>According to Moore, logging is good for forests causing reforestation, not deforestation.</P><P><STRONG>TRUTH:</STRONG> Webster’s Dictionary defines deforestation as “the action or process of clearing of forests.” The argument advanced by forest industry spin-doctors that clear-cutting “causes reforestation, not deforestation” is without basis in fact. It is like arguing that having a heart attack improves your health because of the medical treatment you receive afterwards.</P><P>According to Moore: “Forward-thinking environmentalists and scientists have made clear, technology has now progressed to the point where the activist fear mongering about the safety of nuclear energy bears no resemblance to reality.”</P><P><STRONG>TRUTH:</STRONG></P><P>– The Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) concluded years ago that the lack of containment on Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored advanced nuclear reactor designs constituted a “major safety trade-off.”</P><P>– Patrick Moore has recently begun touting the “safety” of nuclear energy at the behest of the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), which is being bankrolled by the nuclear industry to promote nuclear energy as clean and safe energy. The public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton has been hired to roll out a multi-million dollar campaign to repackage Moore’s propaganda to convince congressional leaders of public support for the building of new nuclear plants.</P><P>Hill and Knowlton are most well known for their public relations work defending the tobacco industry. The PR firm has also worked for industry interests to stall action to protect the ozone layer by executing “a carefully designed campaign attacking the science behind the ozone depletion and delaying government action for two years. This was enough time for DuPont to bring new, ozone-friendly chemicals to market.” Austin American Statesman, Cox News Service Jeff Nesmith June 26, 2005 <A href=""http://www.statesman.com/search/content/insight/stories/06/26doubt.html"" target=""_blank"">http://www.statesman.com/search/content/insight/stories/06/26doubt.html</A></P><P>More information on Hill and Knowlton can be found at:</P><P>http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Hill_%26_Knowlton</P><P>Moore’s recent call that the U.S. should generate 60 percent of U.S. electricity from nuclear power is ludicrous. These plants are acknowledged by the federal government’s own National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States – commonly referred to as the 9/11 Commission – as terrorist targets. An accident or terrorist attack at a nuclear plant could result in thousands of near-term deaths from radiation exposure and hundreds of thousands of long-term deaths from cancer among individuals within only fifty miles of a nuclear plant.</P><P>His proposal not only fails to address the risk posed to the American public by our existing plants, but also fails to address the urgent issue of global warming. According to Dr. Bill Keepin, a physicist and energy consultant in the U.S., “given business-as-usual growth in energy demand, it appears that even an infeasibly massive global nuclear power program could not reduce future emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. To displace coal alone would require the construction of a new nuclear plant every two or three days for nearly four decades…in the United States, each dollar invested in efficiency displaces nearly seven times more <mark>carbon</mark> than a dollar invested in new nuclear power.”</P><P>According to Moore, “Three Mile Island was actually a success story in that the radiation from the partially melted core was contained.”</P><P><STRONG>TRUTH:</STRONG></P><P>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission estimates that 10 million curies of radiation were released into the environment by the Three Mile Island Meltdown. Expert witnesses in the TMI law suits estimated that 150 million curies escaped, because the containment at Three Mile Island was not leak tight and the NRC ignored many of the potential escape routes for the radiation.</P><P><STRONG>VVPR info:</STRONG> Jane Kochersperger, 202-319-2493</P></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

The projections shown in the figure above are based on a medium-low emissions scenario that <mark>climate</mark> modelers refer to as RCP 4.5, which assumes that annual greenhouse gas emissions peak around 2040 and then decline through 2100, presumably from <mark>climate</mark> policies that limit emissions.</P><P>The first map in the top row shows the projected change in annual temperature by 2050, averaged across all 37 model projections. The second and third maps show the projected annual temperature changes averaged across the highest 20 percent and lowest 20 percent of the model projections, in terms of statewide change for Colorado.</P><P>All the models point to a warmer future, with statewide annual temperatures projected to warm between 2.5°F and 5°F by 2050 relative to a 1971–2000 baseline. A 2-degree increase would make the city of Denver’s temperatures in 2050 more like the southern Colorado city of Pueblo is today. With higher emissions (RCP 8.5), the projected warming for Colorado is as much as 6.5°F by mid-century, which would make Denver’s temperatures more similar to those found today in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</P><P>There is less agreement among the models about future precipitation change for Colorado, which is shown in the second row of images. The models are split on whether the future will bring increasing, decreasing, or similar-to-current precipitation in Colorado. They show a range of possible outcomes from a 5 percent decrease to a 6 percent increase by mid-century. The risk of decreasing precipitation appears to be higher for the southern parts of the state.</P><P>It may seem tough to plan for Colorado’s water future given the uncertainty in the precipitation projections, but using even uncertain and imperfect projections of future <mark>climate</mark> at hand can be more helpful to water managers than waiting around for “better” projections.</P><P>“We have high confidence in continued warming, and the warming alone will have impacts on hydrology and water resources, especially the likely continuation of the ongoing shift to earlier timing of snowmelt and runoff,” the report authors write. “The more uncertain projections of annual precipitation and streamflow for Colorado—which in many cases show little or no average change—should not be construed as a ‘no change’ scenario, but rather as a broadening of the range of possible water futures, some of which present serious challenges to the state’s water systems.”</P><P>Even if the future brings more precipitation, benefits to skiers, farmers, and cities may be offset by a warmer atmosphere pulling more moisture out of the state’s snowpacks, soils, crops, and other plants. Rising temperatures are also expected to increase the frequency and severity of heat waves, wildfires, and droughts—which would continue increasing trends already observed over the past 30 years.</P><P><EM>Map by NOAA <mark>Climate</mark>.gov, based on CMIP5 data provided by Imtiaz Rangwala.

Fortunately, <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide is present in much smaller concentrations in the atmosphere. There is no question that <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide is a pollutant  with potential to harm all living things. But, does CO also affect Earth's <mark>climate</mark>? Unlike <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, a compound that contains the same atoms as <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide, <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide is not known as a direct contributor to <mark>climate change</mark>. It does, however, play a role in this area.<mark>Carbon</mark> monoxide is different than most pollutants. It can persist in the atmosphere for about a month and can be transported long distances. However, it is not uniformly distributed around the Earth. This <A href=""http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/shindell_09/"" target=""_blank"">NASA Science Brief on <mark>Carbon</mark> Monoxide</A> explains the issue further.Although <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide is only a weak greenhouse gas, its influence on <mark>climate</mark> goes beyond its own direct effects. Its presence affects concentrations of other greenhouse gases including methane, tropospheric ozone and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide.<mark>Carbon</mark> monoxide readily reacts with the hydroxyl radical (OH) forming a much stronger, greenhouse gas--<mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. This, in turn, increases concentrations of methane, another strong greenhouse gas, because the most common way methane is removed from the atmosphere is when it reacts with OH. So, the formation of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide leaves fewer OH for methane to react with,thus increasing methane's concentration.  A NASA report indicates that <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide is responsible for a 13% reduction in hydroxyl concentrations and through other reactions, a 9% drop in sulfate concentrations. Sulfates are credited for offsetting some of the global warming due to greenhouse gases by reflecting incident solar radiation back to space.Like many pollutants, <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide has both anthropogenic and natural sources. Natural sources include volcanoes and forest fires while human sources (which make up over half of all <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide produced) are mainly vehicle emissions and slash and burn agriculture, but also include some industrial activities.As automobile emission controls have improved in recent years, <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide emissions in western countries have decreased. However, a rapid increase in industrialization and in the number of automobiles in rapidly developing countries like China and India have resulted in increased <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide emissions in those countries.  Your team has been approached by an international foundation concerned about this increase. They are looking forward to your Earth System Science (ESS) analysis.Biomass burning is the burning of vegetation.  This burning includes fires started by lightning and fires started by humans.  The latter includes fires for the purpose of land clearing to increase agricultural areas or to get rid of the stubble from the previous year's <A href=""http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BiomassBurning/"" target=""_blank"">crops.</A>  NASA satellites are able to track the huge plumes of <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide resulting from these fires.  For example, during 2007, large portions of Southeast Asia were blanketed by the smoke from human-induced fires.  <B>Taskings </B><B>Basic </B>Large cities have traditionally been known for their high concentration of <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide due to the large concentrations of motor vehicles and other human induced sources such as cooking.  Mexico City is an example of a city known for its air's high levels of <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide.   In recent years, residents of rapidly developing countries such as China, India and Brazil have greatly increased their use and purchase of motor vehicles. This is being accompanied by an increase in <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide emissions. Your team has been approached by a multinational organization interested in researching the trends in Beijing.  They want to see the trends depicted from NASA satellite data along with an Earth System Science (ESS) analysis resulting from <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide concentrations.

Southwestern ecosystems are especially vulnerable to <mark>climate</mark>- and human-induced changes because of their southern latitude and vertical landscape connectivity, and because of their history of fire exclusion.

Specific industries like biomedicine spend 12 percent or more.</P></DIV><DIV class=""subscriber-only""><P>Report authors were Robin Jolley of American Forest Management Inc., Tim Punke, formerly of <mark>Weyerhaeuser Co.</mark>, Richard Ringeisen of the University of Illinois, Larry Selzer of the Conservation Fund and John Williams of Domtar.</P></DIV><DIV class=""subscriber-only""><P>“I think it accurately calls out that there’s a significant decline in public and private dollars going in,” University of Idaho Policy Analysis Group Director Dennis Becker said. “What’s happened in the last decade or two is the responsibility (for R&amp;D funding) has fallen back on the public sector. The private sector has really pulled back in that area.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""subscriber-only""><P>The report noted that since the financial crisis of 2007, more than 1,000 mills and factories closed nationwide as housing starts fell 78 percent in the following two years. More than half the country’s pulp and paper mills have closed in the last 25 years, driven in part by the rise of paperless digital media. With about 56 percent of the nation’s timber coming off private forests, that’s put pressure on property owners to find other uses for their land.</P></DIV><DIV class=""subscriber-only""><P>“Housing starts in 2016 were barely half the January 2006 level,” the report authors wrote. “In many areas, timber markets alone are not strong enough to provide the markets and income certainty that private landowners need to maintain working forests.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""subscriber-only""><P>At the same time, technology research went dim. The report authors counted barely a quarter of the researchers in forest products technology, chemistry and general engineering compared to three decades ago. The U.S. Forest Service Forest Products Laboratory shrank from 725 after World War II to 141, only 50 of whom are researchers.</P></DIV><DIV class=""subscriber-only""><P>Todd Morgan at the University of Montana’s Bureau of Business and Economic Research said that problem grew as the timber industry moved away from its historical “vertically integrated” corporate structure.</P></DIV><DIV class=""subscriber-only""><P>“When you had mills that also owned the land and had logging crews and the value chain was all in one place, they were recovering the most value from the product,” Morgan said of the old style of companies like Champion International. “When you split that into the part that owns the land and the part that does the milling, that’s changed who the players are and who wants to get involved in the R&amp;D. And what they do do, they’re using for their own competitive advantage. It’s not something to lift all boats.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""subscriber-only""><P>The western United States, primarily Oregon and Washington, produce about a third of U.S. lumber demand. The mostly private forests of the Southeast contribute another third, with Canada supplying the remainder. Becker said that presents a particular challenge for dry, slow-growing forests in places like Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado and Arizona.</P></DIV><DIV class=""subscriber-only""><P>“The low-value products from those Ponderosa pine forests have no good markets in those areas,” Becker said. “And there’s not enough federal money to manage those forests without products being removed (such as traditional sawlogs). Those areas need to create product opportunities like heat and electricity, structural applications or manufactured products. That’s where the infusion of research is really critical.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""subscriber-only""><P>The paper recommends more science on a variety of topics, from microcrystalline cellulose used in food and cosmetics to renewable energy production. It also calls for more strategic research effort from the federal government and universities while noting “incentives are needed both for corporate investment in R&amp;D and for private landowners’ forest management and conservation.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""subscriber-only""><P>Society of American Foresters Director of Government Affairs John Barnwell agreed the industry needs to have more collaboration and clear strategic focus.</P></DIV><DIV class=""subscriber-only""><P>“But we don’t want basic research overlooked,” Barnwell added. “It’s important to experiment with new technology. But don’t lose sight of changing <mark>climate</mark> conditions, best management practices and work that’s actually going on in the forest.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""subscriber-only""><P>While the report observes that forest thinning efforts are essential for growth of large trees in the long term, “they’re prohibitively expensive if they don’t generate any income to offset the costs. Small diameter wood that was once sought by pulp and paper mills now has little value in some areas because of mill closures.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""subscriber-only""><P>On the other hand, companies like Columbia Falls’ SmartLam Technologies Group has seen enough success with its cross-laminated timber panels made from small wood that it plans to move into <mark>Weyerhaeuser Cor</mark>p.’s former lumber mill in January. The company expects to increase production from 20,000 cubic meters a year to more than 80,000 cubic meters, and grow its workforce from 31 to 75 by the end of 2019.</P></DIV><DIV class=""subscriber-only""><P>Especially in the West, those forests also require multiple-use management for things like water supplies, recreation, and wildlife habitat. The authors noted society hasn’t found a good way to price those ecosystem services,</P></DIV><DIV class=""subscriber-only""><P>“If we do want to manage our lands, do restoration treatment, hazardous fuels reduction, and help reduce incidents of catastrophic forest fires, then we need to have an industry and capacity to do work on the ground,” Morgan said. “There’s got to be a profit there. You have to be able to make money doing it. Congress isn’t willing to write a check to subsidize all forest management activity.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""reaction-wrap"" class=""reaction-wrapper hidden-print reaction-fd0737e7-bf61-5725-9b16-a78c14dbce81""><DIV id=""reaction""><DIV id=""reaction-form-wrapper""><FORM id=""reaction-form"" onsubmit=""return"" data-uuid=""fd0737e7-bf61-5725-9b16-a78c14dbce81"" method=""post"" action=""/tncms/counter/editorial/fd0737e7-bf61-5725-9b16-a78c14dbce81/?""><DIV class=""form-icons love""><LABEL class=""love-icon reaction-name""><SPAN class=""emotion-name"">Love</SPAN></LABEL></DIV></FORM></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

    Despite its great importance, there are surprisingly few economic studies of the impact of <mark>climate</mark> on agriculture and how agriculture can adapt under a variety of conditions. This book examines 22 countries across four continents, including both developed and developing economies. It provides both a good analytical basis for additional work and solid results for policy debate concerning income distributional effects such as abatement, adaptation, and equity. 
Agriculture and grazing are a central sector in the livelihood of many people, particularly in developing countries. This book uses the Ricardian method to examine the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on agriculture. It also quantifies how farmers adapt to <mark>climate</mark>. The findings suggest that agriculture in developing countries is more sensitive to <mark>climate</mark> than agriculture in developed countries. Rain-fed cropland is generally more sensitive to warming than irrigated cropland and cropland is more sensitive than livestock. The adaptation to <mark>climate change</mark> results reveal that farmers make many adjustments including switching crops and livestock species, adopting irrigation, and moving between livestock and crops. The results also reveal that impacts and adaptations vary a great deal across landscapes, suggesting that adaptation policies must be location specific. Finally, the book suggests a research agenda for the future.
Economists in academia and the public sector, policy analysts and development agencies will find this broad study illuminating.                            </DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""panel panel-default""><DIV class=""panel-heading""><H4 class=""panel-title""><A data-toggle=""collapse"" data-parent=""#accordion"" href=""#collapse-1"">

These include the mitigation of air-<mark>pollution</mark> impacts, energy-supply security (by increased energy diversity), technological <mark>innovation</mark>, reduced fuel cost, employment and reducing urban migration. Reducing GHG emissions in the energy sector yields a global impact, but the co-benefits are typically experienced on a local or regional level. The variety of co-benefits stemming from GHG mitigation policies and the utilization of new energy technologies can be an integral part of economic policies that strive to facilitate <mark>sustainable</mark> development. These include improved health, employment and industrial development, and are explored in <A href=""ch11.html"" title=""Chapter 11: Mitigation from a cross-sectoral perspective"">Chapter 11</A>. This section therefore only covers aspects specifically related to energy supply. Quantitative information remains primarily limited to health effects with many co-effects not quantified due to a lack of information. </P><P>Fuel switching and the growth of energy-efficiency programmes (Swart et al., 2003) can lead to air-quality improvements and economic benefits as well as reduced GHG emissions (Beg, 2002). The relatively high capital costs for many renewable energy technologies are offset by the fuel input having minimal or zero cost and not prone to price fluctuations, as is the case with fossil fuels (Janssen, 2002). Nuclear energy shares many of the same market co-benefits as renewables (Hagen et al., 2005). Benefits of GHG mitigation may only be expected by future generations, but co-benefits are often detectable to the current generation. </P><P>Co-benefits of mitigation can be important decision criteria in analyses by policymakers, but often neglected (Jochem and Madlener, 2002). There are many cases where the net co-benefits are not monetised, quantified or even identified by decision-makers and businesses. Due consideration of co-benefits can significantly influence policy decisions concerning the level and timing of GHG mitigation action. There may be significant economic advantages to the national stimulation of technical <mark>innovation</mark> and possible spillover effects, with developing countries benefiting from <mark>innovation</mark> stimulated by GHG mitigation in industrialized countries. Most aspects of co-benefits have short-term effects, but they support long-term mitigation policies by creating a central link to <mark>sustainable</mark> development objectives (Kessels and Bakker, 2005). To date, most analyses have calculated GHG mitigation costs by dividing the incremental costs of ‘mitigation technologies’ by the amount of GHG avoided. This implicitly attributes all the costs to GHG-emission reduction and the co-benefits are seen as ancillary. Ideally, one would attribute the incremental costs to the various co-benefits by attempting to weight them. This could lead to significantly lower costs of GHG reductions since the other co-benefits would carry a share of the costs together with a change in the cost ranking of mitigation options (Schlamadinger et al. 2006). </P><P>The reduced costs of new technologies due to experience, and the incentives for further improvement due to competition, can be co-benefits of <mark>climate</mark>-change policies (Jochem and Madlener, 2002). New energy technologies are typically more expensive during their market-introduction phase but substantial learning experience can usually be achieved to reduce costs and enhance skill levels (Barreto, 2001; Herzog et al., 2001; IEA, 2000; McDonald and Schrattenholzer, 2001; NCOE, 2004). Increased net employment and trade of technologies and services are useful co-benefits given high unemployment in many countries. Employment is created at different levels, from research and manufacturing to distribution, installation and maintenance. Renewable-energy technologies are more labour-intensive than conventional technologies for the same energy output (Kamman et al., 2004). For example, solar PV generates 5.65 person-years of employment per 1 million US$ investment (over ten years) and the wind-energy industry 5.7 person-years. In contrast, every million dollars invested in the coal industry generates only 3.96 person-years of employment over the same time period (Singh and Fehrs, 2001). In South Africa, the development of renewable energy technologies could lead to the creation of over 36,000 direct jobs by 2020 (Austin et al., 2003) while more than 900,000 new jobs could be created across Europe by 2020 as a result of the increased use of renewable energy (EUFORES, 2004). </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

The marketing group Colorado Ski Country USA, which represents 23 ski areas including Aspen Snowmass and Arapahoe Basin, reported a <A href=""https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2018/01/12/23-colorado-ski-resorts-post-13-drop-in-early.html"">13 percent drop</A> in visits between opening day and Dec. 31 compared to the same period last season. Early-season visits last season were down 8 percent from the year before, when heavy snow provided a boost.</P><P class=""p-text"">Vail Resorts reported an 11 percent decline in early-season visits at its resorts across the United States, which include four Colorado resorts. That followed a 13 percent drop in early visits last year.</P><P class=""p-text"">Colorado has seen — and bounced back from — winter droughts like this before. Longtime residents might remember the winter of 1976-77, one of Colorado's driest winters on record. The next season saw well-above-average snowfall.

The area has had an average season of 227 days — about seven and a half months — since 2010-11, according to a Coloradoan analysis.</P><P class=""p-text"">But Arapahoe Basin is also one of the most active resorts in the realm of <mark>climate change</mark> advocacy. Along with Aspen Snowmass, it's one of two Colorado resorts that partners with Protect Our Winters. Resort employees sport POW logos on their uniforms, and two employees work specifically on sustainability initiatives that include waste diversion, greenhouse gas emissions tracking, solar panels and efficient lighting.</P><P class=""p-text"">“Even though we’re not as affected as other areas, we still feel it’s our responsibility to take action now,” said Sha Miklas, senior manager of guest services and sustainability. “If Arapahoe Basin survives but everyone down the road doesn’t, that doesn’t do much for us.

Although ski resorts are uniquely vulnerable to <mark>climate change</mark>, emissions of even the largest resorts are a pittance compared to your average landfill or university campus.</P><P class=""p-text"">The true summit for resorts, Miklas and Schendler said, is teaching their patrons to look at nature as a resource that needs to be cherished — not just used.</P><P class=""p-text"">“How do we get people to correlate that connection they have with nature to sustainability?” Miklas said. “How do we get them to realize that if you don’t care about <mark>climate change</mark>, you’re going to lose that connection you feel with nature?”</P><P class=""p-text"">To that end, Aspen Snowmass has adopted a more aggressive approach.</P><P class=""p-text"">“Do you love your neighbor enough to do something about it?” reads a chairlift ad depicting a snowy mountainside and a URL for POW’s <mark>climate</mark> advocacy page. Schendler and other resort leaders lobby government officials on <mark>climate</mark> issues, and the resort’s website includes a page devoted to <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P class=""p-text"">“We got to the point where we asked ourselves, ‘Hey, if you were Aspen (Snowmass), and you legitimately cared about <mark>climate change</mark>, what would you do?’” Schendler said. “And the answer was very different from what corporate sustainability people do. It wasn’t, ‘Reduce your <mark>carbon</mark> footprint by 20 percent.’ It was, ‘Figure out where your power lies, where your leverage is, and use that leverage.’</P><P class=""p-text"">“The focus on yourself is useful in that you can be a model for the rest of the world.

He based the decision on advice from a <A href=""http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/in-the-withdrawal-from-the-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-agreement-the-koch-brothers-campaign-becomes-overt"">small cadre of lobbyists</A> from the fossil fuel industry masquerading as policy experts. <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/non-alternative-facts-about-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-agreement"">In another blog</A>, I’ve detailed the most egregiously inaccurate information in Trump’s speech announcing a withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. The following post focuses on the faulty economic case being made against the Paris Agreement—and the groups responsible for spreading this misinformation.</P><H2>Studies backed by special interests attack the Paris Agreement.</H2><P>One study Trump cited, conducted by the National Economic Research Associates (NERA), was <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/kevin-steinberger/chamber-inflates-costs-ignores-benefits-<mark>climate</mark>-action"">debunked </A>by the NRDC months before.  In the study, NERA grossly inflated the costs of <mark>climate change</mark> action while ignoring the benefits. It doesn’t account for cost-saving policy designs or energy efficiency programs and misrepresented the rapidly falling costs of low-<mark>carbon</mark> technology. The study’s core scenario (cited by Trump) falsely reports a GDP loss of trillions by 2040 due to the Paris Agreement. The American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF), for whom the NERA study was prepared, <A href=""https://www.desmogblog.com/american-council-for-capital-formation#s4"">receives funding from Koch foundations, Exxon, and other polluters</A> with a history of funding <mark>climate</mark> denial. In reality, <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/aug/31/citi-report-slowing-global-warming-would-save-tens-of-trillions-of-dollars"">study</A> after <A href=""https://riskybusiness.org/fromrisktoreturn/"">study</A> has shown the costs of <mark>climate change</mark> damages far outweigh the costs of reducing emissions. Taking <mark>climate</mark> action helps increase returns by 1-4% in 2021, rising to between 3-10% by 2035.</P><H2>Opponents of Paris Agreement Speak for Tiny Cadre of Companies </H2><P>Trump isn’t the only one making false claims based on faulty data. A tiny minority of industry groups are fabricating opposition to the Paris Agreement.</P><P>The Industrial Energy Consumers of America (IECA) sent a <A href=""http://www.ieca-us.com/wp-content/uploads/05.15.17_Letter-to-Trump-Paris-Accord.pdf"">letter</A> to Trump on May 15, expressing their support for withdrawal from Paris. In their letter, they claimed to represent large member companies with over $1 trillion in annual sales. A closer look at their 2015 membership list (because IECA does not make their membership list public), reveals that they are falsely representing many companies.

Even people skeptical about global warming’s dangers are recognizing that, simply because so many others are concerned, the phenomenon has wide-ranging implications.</P><P>Investors already are discounting share prices of companies poorly positioned to compete in a warming world. Many businesses face higher raw material and energy costs as more and more governments enact policies placing a cost on emissions. Consumers are taking into account a company’s environmental record when making purchasing decisions. There’s also a burgeoning market in greenhouse gas emission allowances (the <mark>carbon</mark> market), with annual trading in these assets valued at tens of billions of dollars. Companies that manage and mitigate their exposure to the risks associated with <mark>climate change</mark> while seeking new opportunities for profit will generate a competitive advantage over rivals in a <mark>carbon</mark>-constrained future.</P><P>This article offers a systematic approach to mapping and responding to <mark>climate change</mark> risks. According to Jonathan Lash and Fred Wellington of the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank, the risks can be divided into six categories: <EM>regulatory</EM> (policies such as new emissions standards), <EM>products and technology</EM> (the development and marketing of <mark>climate</mark>-friendly products and services), <EM>litigation</EM> (lawsuits alleging environmental harm), <EM>reputational</EM> (how a company’s environmental policies affect its brand), <EM>supply chain</EM> (potentially higher raw material and energy costs), and <EM>physical</EM> (such as an increase in the incidence of hurricanes). The authors propose a four-step process for responding to <mark>climate change</mark> risk: Quantify your company’s <mark>carbon</mark> footprint; identify the risks and opportunities you face; adapt your business in response; and do it better than your competitors.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article article-first-row premium""><ARTICLE-IDEAINBRIEF class=""article-ideainbrief""><H4 class=""ideainbrief-title""> The Idea in Brief </H4><DIV class=""ideainbrief-contents""><P>Global warming is affecting your business, no matter what industry you’re in. You face numerous <mark>climate</mark>-change risks—including tough emission-reduction legislation, damaging backlash from environmentally concerned consumers, and weather-related damage to physical assets. Consumers are increasingly taking your environmental record into account when they make purchasing decisions. And investors are already discounting share prices of firms poorly positioned to compete in a <mark>carbon</mark>-constrained world. </P><P>But the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> also offer new sources of competitive advantage, say Lash and Wellington. How to seize those opportunities? First, measure your firm’s contribution to global warming. Then assess your <mark>climate</mark>-related risks and opportunities. Reinvent your business—before rivals do—to mitigate those risks <EM>and</EM> seize the opportunities. </P><P>GE, for instance, launched Ecomagination—a set of clean technologies serving the transportation, energy, water, and consumer product sectors. Revenues from Ecomagination reached $8.5 billion in 2005, with orders and commitments nearly doubling to $17 billion. </P><P>The Idea in Practice </P><P>Lash and Wellington recommend this four-step process for mitigating <mark>climate</mark>-related risks and seizing new opportunities for competitive advantage: </P><H2>Step 1: Quantify Your <mark>Carbon</mark> “Footprint”</H2><P>Using available reporting standards (such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol), prepare an inventory that provides a true and fair account of your company’s greenhouse gas emissions. Differentiate between direct (such as smokestack) emissions and indirect emissions (for example, those resulting from your firm’s energy consumption and travel). </P><P>By quantifying your <mark>carbon</mark> “footprint,” you signal to investors, customers, and employees your recognition that <mark>climate change</mark> is a crucial issue. And you begin gaining a broad view of the risks and opportunities presented by a <mark>carbon</mark>-constrained economy. </P><H2>Step 2: Assess Your <mark>Carbon</mark>-Related Risks and Opportunities</H2><P>Consider how the following risks could hurt—or present opportunities to help—your business: </P><UL><LI><STRONG>Regulatory</STRONG>—mandatory emissions-reduction legislation</LI></UL><UL><LI><STRONG>Supply chain</STRONG>—suppliers’ passing their higher <mark>carbon</mark>-related costs to you</LI></UL><UL><LI><STRONG>Product and technology</STRONG>—rivals’ developing <mark>climate</mark>-friendly offerings before you do</LI></UL><UL><LI><STRONG>Litigation</STRONG>—lawsuits charging you with negligence, public nuisance, or trespass</LI></UL><UL><LI><STRONG>Reputation</STRONG>—destructive consumer or shareholder backlash</LI></UL><UL><LI><STRONG>Physical</STRONG>—damage to your assets through drought, floods, and storms</LI></UL><P><SPAN style=""idea-in-practice-example""><SPAN style=""idea-in-practice-example-header"">Example: </SPAN></SPAN></P><P>Forest products company Weyerhauser could ask itself questions such as: “Will milder winters spur wood-beetle populations, damaging trees? Could <mark>climate change</mark> affect demand for our products, if customers require more energy efficient building materials—or increasingly choose wood over other materials?”  </P><H2>Step 3: Adapt Your Business</H2><P>Based on your assessment of how <mark>climate change</mark> could affect your company, develop and implement strategies for reducing energy consumption and <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.

Many businesses face higher raw material and energy costs as governments around the globe increasingly enact policies placing a cost on emissions. Consumers are taking into account a company’s environmental record when making purchasing decisions. There’s a burgeoning market in greenhouse gas emission allowances (the so-called <mark>carbon</mark> market), with annual trading in these assets valued at tens of billions of dollars. Even in the United States, which has lagged the rest of the developed world in the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, the debate is rapidly shifting from whether <mark>climate change</mark> legislation should be enacted to when and in what form.</P><P>Companies that manage and mitigate their exposure to <mark>climate</mark>-change risks while seeking new opportunities for profit will generate a competitive advantage over rivals in a <mark>carbon</mark>-constrained future.

Our message: It’s not enough to do something; you have to do it better—and more quickly—than your competitors.</P><H2>The Effects of <mark>Climate Change</mark> on the Planet</H2><P>Let us stop here for a second and state our belief that <mark>climate change</mark> does in fact pose a serious problem for the world. The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is changing the earth’s <mark>climate</mark> at a rate unprecedented in history. The year 2005 was the warmest on record, and the ten warmest years have all occurred since 1980. Ice in the Arctic, the Antarctic, and Greenland is melting, and virtually all of the world’s glaciers are shrinking.</P><P>Numerous studies suggest that the warming of the earth’s oceans has resulted in more-powerful tropical storms, which generate their energy from warm ocean waters. For example, a U.S. government study released in May 2006 found that the warming of the tropical North Atlantic will contribute to more and stronger hurricanes. In fact, global data show that storms, droughts, and other weather-related disasters are growing more severe and more frequent. </P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P>The consequences for the planet of inaction on <mark>climate change</mark> are becoming clear. But what exactly are the business implications?</P></DIV></DIV><P>These observed effects are the result of a roughly one-degree-Fahrenheit warming of the planet, an increase that would accelerate under current emission trends, thereby increasing the pace of physical and biological changes. (See the sidebar “How Much Warmer Will It Get?”) Half of the fossil fuels ever burned have been used since the end of World War II, and emissions continue to rise rapidly. In order to halt the buildup of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere, global emissions would have to stop growing at all in this decade and be reduced by an astonishing 60% from today’s levels by 2050. </P><ARTICLE-SIDEBAR class=""article-sidebar sidebar--half"" data-sidebar-alternate=""sidebar""><H4 class=""sidebar-title"">How Much Warmer Will It Get?</H4><DIV class=""sidebar-contents height--collapse""><P>According to NASA, 2005 was the warmest year in over a century, and the ten warmest years have all occurred since 1980. The shrinking polar ice caps aren’t the only apparent consequence: Storms, droughts, and other weather-related disasters—for example, epidemics, whose spread is correlated with temperature and moisture rates—are growing more severe and more frequent. </P><P>All that, and the planet has warmed only by roughly one degree Fahrenheit. Most <mark>climate</mark> models predict a three- to eight-degree rise in global average temperatures if atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases reach twice preindustrial levels, something that will happen by 2050 if current trends continue. All of those models show some risk (between 5% and 15%) that the temperature will rise significantly more than that. Furthermore, there is a risk of unknown magnitude that positive feedback mechanisms in the <mark>climate</mark> system—for instance, the release of methane from melting permafrost in northern Canada, which could contribute to global warming and further melting of the permafrost—will create sudden, nonlinear accelerations in warming.</P></DIV></ARTICLE-SIDEBAR><P>The consequences for the planet of inaction on <mark>climate change</mark> are becoming clear. But what exactly are the business implications?</P><H2>The Effects of <mark>Climate Change</mark> on Your Company</H2><P>Executives typically manage environmental risk as a threefold problem of regulatory compliance, potential liability from industrial accidents, and pollutant release mitigation. But <mark>climate change</mark> presents business risks that are different in kind because the impact is global, the problem is long-term, and the harm is essentially irreversible. Furthermore, U.S. government policies have offered companies operating in the United States little guidance as to how environmental policy may change in the future. Ignoring the financial and competitive consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> could lead a company to formulate an inaccurate risk profile. 
 </P><P>While this obviously has been the case for utilities and energy-intensive industries like chemical manufacturing, it now holds true for most industries. In fact, the most important distinctions to be made when considering environmental risk assessment aren’t between sectors but within sectors, where a company’s <mark>climate</mark>-related risk mitigation and product strategies can create competitive advantage.</P><P>Government regulators aren’t the only ones monitoring individual companies for inadequate <mark>climate</mark>-related practices. Big investors are beginning to demand more disclosure from companies. For example, the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project, a coalition of institutional investors representing more than $31 trillion in assets, annually requests information from large multinational companies about their <mark>climate</mark>-risk positioning. Its most recent report, released in 2006, showed a marked increase not only in the awareness of <mark>climate change</mark> on the part of the respondents but also in the best practices being developed to manage exposure to <mark>climate</mark> risk.</P><P>Similarly, investor coalitions are filing shareholder resolutions requesting more <mark>climate</mark> risk disclosure from companies. More than two dozen <mark>climate</mark>-related resolutions were filed with companies in the 2004 to 2005 period, triple the number from 2000 to 2001.</P><P>As Wal-Mart CEO Lee Scott told us, a corporate focus on reducing greenhouse gases as quickly as possible is a good business strategy: “It will save money for our customers, make us a more efficient business, and help position us to compete effectively in a <mark>carbon</mark>-constrained world.”</P><P>The far-reaching effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on business become clearer when you start to think about the different kinds of risk—most of which can be transformed into opportunities—and how they could affect the value of your company.</P><H3>Regulatory risk.</H3><P>This is the most obvious area of impact, whether it takes the form of regulating emissions of the products you make (for example, automobile emission limits for carmakers) or of the manufacturing process you use in creating those products. Companies in much of the world are already subject to the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and other greenhouse gases by requiring developed countries—and, by extension, companies operating within those countries—to limit greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>To meet Kyoto targets, the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme, for example, grants companies <EM>allowances</EM> that authorize them to emit certain amounts of specified greenhouse gases. If a company’s emissions are higher than its allotted allowances, it has to buy additional allowances from other companies. If its emissions are lower than its allotment, it can sell its unneeded allowances on the market. Companies can earn <EM>credits,</EM> which also give the holder the right to emit certain amounts of gases, by investing in emissions abatement projects outside their own organizations and even countries—as when, say, a French company invests in a wind-powered electricity generation project in Brazil. These credits can either be used to offset companies’ own emissions or be sold on the market.</P><P>Even in the United States, which withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, various regional, state, and local government policies increasingly affect companies. Seven northeastern states have adopted an agreement to cap <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from utilities and establish a <mark>carbon</mark>-trading scheme. (See the sidebar “A U.S. <mark>Carbon</mark> Market.”) California has enacted regulations requiring that from 2008 to 2016, greenhouse gas emissions from new cars be reduced by 30% and has passed legislation to reduce total emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. A 2007 executive order also requires a reduction in the <mark>carbon</mark> content in motor fuels. Twenty states require utilities to obtain a percentage of the power they sell from renewable sources, and more than 218 U.S. cities have adopted programs to reduce emissions. 
 </P><ARTICLE-SIDEBAR class=""article-sidebar sidebar--half"" data-sidebar-alternate=""sidebar""><H4 class=""sidebar-title"">A U.S. <mark>Carbon</mark> Market</H4><DIV class=""sidebar-contents height--collapse""><P>The European Union’s market that allows companies to buy and sell greenhouse gas emission credits granted under the Kyoto Protocol has received considerable attention. A similar kind of GHG market is beginning to form in the United States, at least on a regional basis, largely owing to the success of long-standing emissions trading systems for other kinds of air and water pollutants. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is a multistate government program aimed at reducing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions from power plants in the northeastern U.S. through a mix of emissions caps and the trading of emissions allowances. The initiative will govern GHG emissions from most electricity-generating units in the region that use more than 50% fossil fuel. Starting in 2009, and at the end of each three-year compliance period thereafter, each regulated source must own allowances equaling its aggregate <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions during the period. Generating plants can buy, sell, bank, and trade allowances or purchase offset credits from other companies in ways that will keep their compliance costs as low as possible.</P></DIV></ARTICLE-SIDEBAR><P>The U.S. government seems increasingly likely to take some sort of action, possibly in the near future. One 30-country survey, conducted by GlobeScan, shows that 76% of Americans believe global warming is a serious problem, and half believe it is a very serious one. (All the other countries surveyed except Kenya and South Africa reported even greater concern on the part of residents.) Numerous emission-reduction bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and, although federal legislation is still at least several years away, U.S. companies’ investments in capital equipment—from power plants to new buildings—represent financial commitments to <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions that may become very costly under future regulatory regimes.</P><P>For most businesses, a comprehensive federal policy concerning <mark>climate change</mark> is preferable to a patchwork of state and local regulations. Consequently, U.S. companies are beginning to shift their political position; more than 40 <EM>Fortune</EM> 500 companies have announced that they favor mandatory federal regulation of greenhouse gases. In January 2007, a group of leading companies, including Lehman Brothers, Alcoa, and Pacific Gas and Electric, called for rapid enactment of mandatory, economy-wide regulatory programs to support a 10% to 30% reduction of greenhouse gases over 15 years in the U.S. At a Senate hearing in 2006, representatives of companies such as General Electric, Duke Energy, and Exelon made the case that it was time to move forward with legislation. They would rather know the rules soon, they said, than be surprised by sudden political urgency.</P><P>By immediately initiating an assessment of how future legislation might affect them, companies can manage the regulatory risk and, crucially, gain an advantage over less prescient rivals.</P><H3>Supply chain risk.</H3><P>As they assess their susceptibility to future regulations, companies should also evaluate the vulnerability of their suppliers, which could lead to higher component and energy costs as suppliers pass along increasing <mark>carbon</mark>-related costs to their customers. Auto manufacturing, for instance, relies heavily on suppliers of steel, aluminum, glass, rubber, and plastics, all of whom are likely to be seriously affected by emissions regulations or—as in the case of aluminum manufacturing, a big consumer of energy—by regulations on their suppliers’ suppliers.</P><P>A company should also take into account the geographical distribution of its supplier network. Executives should be aware of how many of their suppliers operate in, say, the European Union, where regulatory structures are already in place. In addition, executives must be mindful that the other <mark>climate</mark>-related risks discussed here could affect not just their own companies but their suppliers as well.</P><H3>Product and technology risk.</H3><P>Some companies will fare better than others in a <mark>carbon</mark>-constrained future, depending on their ability to identify ways to exploit new market opportunities for <mark>climate</mark>-friendly products and services.</P><P>For example, a technology for converting coal into energy (IGCC, or integrated gasification combined cycle), while currently more expensive than traditional methods used in pulverized-coal plants, can lower aggregate <mark>carbon</mark> emissions through better efficiency and possibly <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide capture and storage. In doing so, IGCC would reduce the significant costs that coal-fired plants would face under stricter emissions standards. Companies at the forefront of commercializing such technologies could see significant revenue growth as demand for low-<mark>carbon</mark> products increases.</P><P>Opportunities are not limited to the manufacturing sector. An investment management firm in the United Kingdom, Generation Investment Management, offers investment products that factor in the <mark>climate</mark> risks facing companies held in its portfolios. The insurance company AIG offers brokerage and greenhouse gas management services to clients participating in markets, such as the one operating in the European Union, for the buying and selling of greenhouse gas emissions allowances and credits. 
 </P><P>Indeed, these new <mark>carbon</mark> markets create all kinds of opportunities for professional services firms, particularly financial institutions. Among other things, financial services firms can help companies craft the complex hedging and trading strategies needed to minimize costs in such markets.</P><H3>Litigation risk.</H3><P>Companies that generate significant <mark>carbon</mark> emissions face the threat of lawsuits similar to those common in the tobacco, pharmaceutical, and asbestos industries. For instance, in an unprecedented case spearheaded by the former New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer and currently being considered by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals, eight states and New York City have sued five of America’s largest power companies, demanding that they cut <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. In a federal district court case in Mississippi, plaintiffs are suing oil and coal companies for greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that they contributed to the severity of Hurricane Katrina. The claims in that case include unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy (against the American Petroleum Institute), public and private nuisance, trespass, negligence, and fraudulent misrepresentation.</P><P>Companies that don’t adequately address the issue of <mark>climate change</mark> also can create personal liabilities for directors and officers who become vulnerable to shareholder-related litigation. Swiss Re, for example, has found that such suits constitute a potential exposure in the company’s directors and officers insurance portfolio.</P><H3>Reputational risk.</H3><P>Companies also face judgment in the court of public opinion, where they can be found guilty of selling or using products, processes, or practices that have a negative impact on the <mark>climate</mark>. The potential for consumer or shareholder backlash is particularly high in environmentally sensitive markets or in competitive sectors where brand loyalty is an important attribute of corporate value. In a recent study analyzing the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on brand value, The <mark>Carbon</mark> Trust, an independent consultancy funded by the UK government, found that in some sectors the value of a company’s brand could indeed be at risk because of negative perceptions related to <mark>climate change</mark>. As is the case in other risk areas, companies can turn reputational risk into an opportunity by leveraging practices that show them to be good citizens of the planet.</P><H3>Physical risk.</H3><P>Finally, there is the direct risk posed by the changing <mark>climate</mark> itself: physical effects such as droughts, floods, storms, and rising sea levels. The insurance, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, real estate, and tourism industries are particularly exposed because of their dependence on the physical environment and the elements. Physical <mark>climate</mark> risk can also affect sectors such as oil and gas through higher insurance premiums paid on assets located in vulnerable areas. Munich Re, for instance, raised its rates for insuring Gulf Coast oil rigs by 400% in the days after Hurricane Katrina struck. And ripples of physical risk can extend into some unexpected areas: For instance, Coca-Cola studies the linkages between <mark>climate change</mark> and water availability and how this will impact the location of its new bottling facilities.</P><P>Because companies’ exposure to each of these six aspects of <mark>climate</mark> risk differs greatly, it is essential to generate tailored <mark>climate</mark>-risk profiles and strategies to mitigate the risk. Of course, companies in a given sector will have similar exposure to certain risks. For example, regulatory risks are more important in the power sector, while supply chain risks are critical in retail industries. But there also are differences within sectors—for example, varying levels of reputational risk.</P><P>It’s important to remember that for some industries there is a direct upside to <mark>climate change</mark>, because government policy and public concern will create new needs and new markets. For instance, the “green buildings” market has historically occupied a tiny niche in the construction industry. Now, rising energy prices and resurgent public concern about sustainability have transformed the markets for environmentally friendly materials and technologies into explosive growth areas. The National Association of Homebuilders, for instance, estimates that green buildings will account for 5% to 10% of housing starts in 2010, up from 2% in 2005.</P><P>The venture capitalist John Doerr was recently quoted as saying that green technology could match information technology and biotechnology as a significant money-making opportunity. He called <mark>climate change</mark> “one of the most pressing global challenges” and said that the resulting demand for <mark>innovation</mark> would create the “mother of all markets.” 
 </P><H2>Improving Your Company’s <mark>Climate</mark> Competitiveness</H2><P>In working with firms as they assess their exposure to <mark>climate change</mark> and begin to develop <mark>climate</mark> strategies, we have found that the most successful efforts include four key steps, each of which requires strong leadership at the top and involves significant learning across the organization.</P><H3>Step 1: Quantify your <mark>carbon</mark> footprint.</H3><P>Since you can manage only what you measure, companies need to first understand the source and level of their own greenhouse gas emissions and begin tracking those emissions over time. This quantitative and relatively straightforward task can lead to heightened consciousness of <mark>climate change</mark> issues within a company and set the stage for a broader look at the strategic risks and opportunities they pose.</P><P>In quantifying their <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, companies need to create an accurate inventory of their greenhouse gas emissions. They should differentiate between direct and indirect emissions—that is, between their own “smokestack” emissions and those resulting from their energy consumption, travel, and other activities. They should also establish and adjust emissions baselines and evaluate best practices in reporting this information. The aim is to identify and prioritize emission reduction opportunities and establish strategies for participating in greenhouse-gas-trading markets.</P><P>One method for performing this kind of accounting is the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which our organization developed with the World Business Council for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development. This tool, which has been taken up by the International Standards Organization, has been used by several hundred companies to measure and track their own greenhouse gas emissions and by industry groups, including the International Aluminum Institute and the International Council of Forest and Paper Associations, to develop complementary industry-specific calculation tools. (For a detailed explanation of how to use the protocol—along with a tool to help assess the value of emissions reduction initiatives and to factor <mark>climate</mark>-related costs into decisions on new capital projects—go to www.ghgprotocol.org.)</P><P>The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has set guidelines requiring it to reduce its environmental footprint by lowering energy consumption. But that goal would be meaningless unless the company first created a systematic audit of its current activities that have a direct and indirect impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Having done that, the company can now identify possible conservation and emissions efficiency projects, which it reports through a companywide energy database. Pfizer has identified more than 600 such projects at all levels of the company.</P><P>Companies that quantify their footprints send a strong signal that they recognize the importance of <mark>climate change</mark> as a business risk—and an opportunity. We know of companies that began by conducting a <mark>carbon</mark> audit to uncover inefficient and costly energy practices and then moved on to identify opportunities for brand enhancement around the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>. As we’ll see, these companies eventually leveraged their knowledge about <mark>climate</mark>-related issues to develop new and profitable products.</P><H3>Step 2: Assess your <mark>carbon</mark>-related risks and opportunities.</H3><P>The emissions footprint tells only part of the story. After determining the direct and indirect impact your company is having on the <mark>climate</mark>, you need to broaden your analysis and think strategically about how the six risks could hurt—or offer opportunities that better position—your business.</P><P>The forest products company Weyerhaeuser, whose mills create a significant <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, has committed to reducing operational emissions by 40% by 2020. But the company should also be considering <mark>climate</mark>-related issues beyond its emissions profile. Will the transportation costs to deliver its products rise significantly in a <mark>carbon</mark>-constrained economy? Are there potential physical effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on its main raw material, trees, such as greater damage by wood beetles because of milder winters? 
 </P><P>Another way to assess the effect that <mark>climate</mark>-related forces will have on your company is to consider their direct and indirect financial impact. You can look at the “<mark>carbon</mark> intensity” of your profits—that is, what percentage is derived from products with high <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions. Or you can look at ways in which <mark>climate change</mark> could affect your revenues and costs. On the cost side, <mark>climate change</mark> may drive increases in raw material costs, direct regulatory costs, capital expenditures (for example, new facilities with lower emissions levels), insurance premiums for assets located in at-risk areas (such as the Gulf Coast), and possibly even new tax liabilities. Revenues will be affected by your ability to pass these costs on to customers through new pricing structures while exploiting new market opportunities and maintaining market share.

Calculating the impact of <mark>climate</mark> risk on cash flows and costs of capital is critical to understanding your company’s ability to compete in a <mark>carbon</mark>-constrained future.</P><H3>Step 3: Adapt your business in response to the risks and opportunities.</H3><P>Having assessed the ways in which <mark>climate change</mark> could affect your company, you will be prepared to develop strategies and make moves based on that knowledge. Those moves range from the obvious reductions in energy consumption and <mark>carbon</mark> emissions to sometimes wholesale reinventions of parts of your business.</P><P>Caterpillar is investing in making its already relatively low-emission diesel engines more efficient. It also has found opportunity in the risk of greater regulation by building a new business that makes particulate filter systems to be retrofitted on its own and others’ engines. The company is studying turbines that run on alternative fuels, as well as combined heat and power generation turbines that recover waste heat. It is poised to commit significant R&amp;D funds to these projects as soon as U.S. regulations put a cost on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, thus making alternative fuels and technologies more attractive.</P><P>Creative moves aren’t restricted to heavy manufacturing and other industries traditionally unfriendly to the environment. Wal-Mart is in the middle of a three-year plan to reduce energy use at its stores by up to 30%. The initiative, part of a highly publicized plan to boost energy efficiency, cut down on waste, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, was launched not only to meet current or anticipated regulations but to burnish the company’s reputation in an area where it had been attacked by critics.</P><P>In a lower-emissions sector, financial services, another industry in which reputation is important, Goldman Sachs has implemented a coordinated environmental-policy framework that, among other things, requires the measurement and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions attributable to its internal operations. The firm also is active in the burgeoning market for <mark>carbon</mark> allowances and has a team dedicated to doing research for clients on how environmental issues such as <mark>climate change</mark> can affect stock market valuations.

The analysis found that Honda and Toyota were best positioned to sell cars in a <mark>carbon</mark>-constrained economy, not only because their current fleets were more fuel efficient than most of their rivals’ but also because they were leaders in the commercialization of hybrid vehicles.

Revenues from Ecomagination products reached $10.1 billion in 2005, with orders and commitments nearing $17 billion. And the R&amp;D program is already paying off, with a 75% increase in certified Ecomagination products brought to market.</P><P>The aggressive moves by GE and other forward-looking companies show that <mark>climate change</mark> isn’t a topic to repeatedly table until next year’s meeting. It is already influencing the competitive dynamics in markets all over the world. As GE chairman and CEO Jeffrey Immelt recently commented, “Our customers have made it clear that providing solutions to environmental challenges like <mark>climate change</mark> is essential to society’s well-being, and a clear growth opportunity for GE. Companies with the technology and vision to provide products and services that address <mark>climate</mark> and other pressing issues will enjoy a competitive advantage.” Or, to put it differently, they will do not just well but <EM>better</EM> by doing good.</P><DIV class=""mvm description-text hbrgray, line-height-tight"">A version of this article appeared in the <A href=""/archive-toc/BR0703"">March 2007</A> issue of <EM>Harvard Business Review</EM>.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""authors mvl"" js-target=""authors-section""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""content-area--article column""><DIV class=""is-inline-block width-100pct""><P class=""mbn description-text ""><SPAN class=""bodybold"">Jonathan Lash</SPAN> (<A xmlns="""" href=""mailto:jlash@wri.org"">jlash@wri.org</A>) is the president and</P></DIV><DIV class=""is-inline-block width-100pct""><P class=""mbn description-text ""><SPAN class=""bodybold"">Fred Wellington</SPAN> (<A xmlns="""" href=""mailto:fwellington@wri.org"">fwellington@wri.org</A>) is a senior financial analyst at the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank based in Washington, DC.

The complaint asks SFI to suspend or revoke Weyerhaeuser’s certification and to prescribe conditions ensuring that Weyerhaeuser reforms its practices.</P><H3 class=""Subheading"">Why did Sierra Club file this complaint? </H3><P>A key priority of the Sierra Club is to encourage <mark>sustainable</mark> and environmentally-sound forestry on state and private land so that these forests provide resilient habitats for all forms of fish and wildlife in these days of <mark>climate change</mark>.  The Club believes that credible, independent forest certification is a promising tool that can encourage and reward responsible and <mark>sustainable</mark> forestry. </P><P>But credible forest certification is threatened by certification systems that are little more than fronts for timber companies and industry trade associations.  Moreover, whether a forest certification system is environmentally credible depends, in part, on whether the system maintains meaningful environmental standards and enforces those standards on the ground. </P><P>The citizens of Washington State were shocked and angered when massive landslides, log-jams, and flooding wreaked havoc on Southwest Washington in December 2007.  To understand what went wrong and what can be done to prevent future disasters, WFLC commissioned ENTRIX, an environmental consulting firm, to investigate these landslides.  The experts concluded that Weyerhaeuser engaged in highly risky forestry practices on steep and unstable slopes contrary to SFI’s environmental commitments.  Accordingly, the Sierra Club filed a complaint against Weyerhaeuser to hold the company accountable and to ensure that SFI’s environmental standards do not tolerate forestry practices that are environmentally risky and harmful.</P><H3 class=""Subheading"">What does the complaint allege?</H3><P>The Sierra Club's complaint presents scientific evidence that Weyerhaeuser’s forest practices violated the following SFI standards that are required of SFI-certified forest landowners:</P><UL><UL><LI>to conserve soil, and protect soil productivity</LI></UL><UL><LI>to identify and manage geologically important areas</LI></UL><UL><LI>to plan for wet-weather events</LI></UL><UL><LI><DIV>to replant all of the forests it logs</DIV></LI></UL><UL><LI>to protect riparian zones</LI></UL><UL><LI>to comply with state water quality standards</LI></UL><UL><LI>to conduct economically, environmentally and socially responsible forest practices</LI></UL></UL><P>The complaint is based on scientific research conducted by WFLC and ENTRIX showing that Weyerhaeuser negligently logged extremely steep and unstable mountainsides in Southwest Washington despite overwhelming evidence that they were prone to landslides.  This steep slope logging triggered massive landslides, which in turn produced downstream log-jams and exacerbated flooding in a major regional rainstorm in December 2007.  Contrary to Weyerhaeuser’s claims, the landslides and the downstream damage they caused cannot fairly be attributed solely to the quantity of precipitation.  In fact, the rainstorm, while large, was not more than a “50 year” storm.</P><P>The complaint demonstrates that Weyerhaeuser’s logging was risky and irresponsible.  For example, Weyerhaeuser:</P><UL><UL><LI>Clear-cut or built roads on many slopes exceeding 55 degrees without leaving forested buffers for many slide-prone areas.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Clear-cut or built roads on 987 acres of slopes predicted as certain to deliver to streams.</LI></UL><UL><LI><DIV>Clear-cut or built roads on 841 acres of areas that have slid in the past.</DIV></LI></UL><UL><LI><DIV>Clear-cut or built roads on 1,771 acres that Weyerhaeuser’s own studies rated as “high hazard.”</DIV></LI></UL><UL><LI><DIV>Clear-cut or built roads on 3,461 acres of slopes that had high soil erosion potential.</DIV></LI></UL><UL><LI><DIV>Had landslides that totaled about 648 acres deliver approximately 3.1 to 6.3 million cubic yards of sediment to perennial streams in two of its watersheds.</DIV></LI></UL></UL><P>Despite Weyerhaeuser’s acknowledgement that this area is “a landscape vulnerable to mass wasting” and its access to sources of best available science that map landslide risk, Weyerhaeuser harvested forests and built roads on <B>thousands of acres </B>of slopes that had a high hazard rating, probable stream delivery rating, a history of landsliding in the past, high slope instability, high soil erosion potential, and that are located in peak rain-on-snow zones. </P><P>Landslide densities inside Weyerhaeuser logging and road-building units were consistently higher than landslide densities inside harvest and road-building units on neighboring private industrial forest lands with comparable precipitation, lithology, stand age, and slope instability.  When all of these variables were combined in a multivariate model, the odds of sliding on Weyerhaeuser lands were <B>2.2 to 2.7 times</B> the odds of sliding on other private industrial forest lands with all other factors (including precipitation) being equal.</P><P>In addition, the ENTRIX report showed that the landslides were linked to the flooding and associated damage downstream.  It also found that logging and road-building increased the incidence of landslides, and the landslides delivered large quantities of woody debris and sediment to the stream network.  Large log jams accumulated downstream, and most of this wood probably originated from the landslides as opposed to the riparian buffers.  The flooding was exacerbated by these log jams, by the build-up of sediment in the stream channels, and by the scouring of stream beds and banks in the headwaters. </P></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

This would equate to a 10% increase in the current level of global forest cover.”</P><P>Currently, planted forests account for only 6.6% of world’s forests. The ambition and the recommendation of the working group is to increase this area by 158 million hectares, equivalent to 17% of the US landmass, by 2050, with a focus on the potential for degraded land to be restored.</P><P>“The model of New Generation Plantations, a program jointly developed between WWF and major forest growers, can provide the standards by which this could be achieved in a <mark>sustainable</mark> way,” Mr. Penido added.</P><P>“Critical <mark>carbon</mark> sinks such as peatlands also need to be protected and managed, especially in developing countries where they are subject to significant economic pressures. The fate of unmanaged forests has been again made clear by the recent season of fire and haze in Indonesia where two million hectares of forests have been burnt and tons of <mark>carbon</mark> and other gases have been emitted to the atmosphere. We believe that the private sector should play a key role in the protection, conservation and restoration of forests as we move towards a low-<mark>carbon</mark> future,&quot; said Mr. Bey Soo Khiang, APRIL Group Chairman.</P><P>The next phase in the ambition is to meet the tripling global demand for forest products from sustainably managed forests by 2050 and to fast track bio economy development through cross-sector and value chain collaboration.</P><P>Underpinning this ambition is the recognition that forests store vast amounts of <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>“Forests globally store approximately 638 Gt of <mark>carbon</mark>, more than the total amount of <mark>carbon</mark> in the entire atmosphere,” says Weyerhaeuser’s Dr. Edie Sonne Hall, Manager, <mark>Sustainable</mark> Forestry adding that “products from sustainably managed forests also store <mark>carbon</mark>, and displace materials that are emissions intensive or derived from fossil fuels.”</P><P>Wood-based products, from sustainably managed forests, contribute to <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration, annually adding 189 million tons of <mark>carbon</mark> per year.  Forests and its products are therefore one of the most effective and completely natural systems for the sequestration and storage of <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>“Simply, the more <mark>carbon</mark> we can store in wood-based products then the less <mark>carbon</mark> there is in the atmosphere and the less <mark>carbon</mark> we need to emit to produce goods,” said Dr. Sonne Hall.</P><P>A key feature of the action plan is the closer collaboration proposed between the forest sector value chain and the construction, automotive and energy sectors.“Under the assumption that only 5% of the 2050 biofuel uptake predicted by the International Energy Agency is attributable to forest-derived side streams and residues, the mitigation potential in 2050 is 0.1 Gt <mark>CO2</mark> per year. If this is ramped up linearly, so that the emissions saving in 2050 is 0.1 Gt <mark>CO2</mark> per annum, the cumulative emissions avoided by using forest-derived biofuels is 0.34 Gt <mark>CO2</mark> in 2030 and 1.8 Gt <mark>CO2</mark> in 2050,” said Peter Bakker, President &amp; CEO, WBCSD.Regional dialogues in five countries found that the construction sector could play a significant role in creating the demand conditions that would support the growth of sustainably managed forests.</P><P>“Recent NCASI research shows a total cumulative mitigation benefit of 2.9 Gt <mark>CO2</mark> in 2050 associated with increasing rate of growth in the use of wood in construction by 25% over the trendline” added Mr. Bakker. </P><P>The plan advocates for a shift from an economic reliance on fossil-fuels to a renewable, forest-based bioeconomy.</P><P>“Renewable materials are the solution to resource scarcity and a way to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark>. Forests and forest products, in both their traditional form and in innovative materials, can empower the bioeconomy,” says Mr Noel Morrin, EVP Sustainability at Stora Enso.  “Chemicals, intelligent packaging, plastic composites, fabrics, personal care products and almost anything made from fossil fuel resources can be made from renewable materials,” Mr. Morrin said.</P><P>Importantly, the members of the Forests and Forest Products as <mark>Carbon</mark> Sinks working group will take responsibility for reporting their achievements as part of the Forest Solutions Group Key Performance Indicator Project which tracks companies’ sustainability performance.</P><P>Drawing on the expertise of the global forest sector value chain, the Forests and Forest Products as <mark>Carbon</mark> Sinks LCTPi working group engaged a range of NGO, research and academic organizations through regional dialogues in South Africa, India, the USA, Brazil and Europe to develop the action plan.</P><P>The members of the working group are Svenska Cellulosa AB (SCA), UPM, Metsä Group, International Paper, Stora Enso, Suzano, CMPC, Weyerhaeuser, Fibria, Grupo Portucel Soporcel, APRIL Group, Unilever.  Technical support was provided by NCASI.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""bottom-content-block""><SECTION class=""zone zone-pre_footer""><DIV class=""bm-block bm-twig_block bm-vt-twig_block ""><SECTION class=""newsletter-subscriber""><DIV class=""container""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-sm-7 col-md-5 col-md-offset-1""><H3 class=""title"">Stay on top of our latest news by subscribing to our Sustain newsletter</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class=""zone zone-footer""><DIV class=""bm-block bm-twig_block bm-vt-twig_block ""><FOOTER class=""main-footer""><DIV class=""container""><DIV class=""as-table""><DIV class=""footer-copyright as-cell""><DIV class=""wrapper""><DIV class=""copyright""><DIV class=""ezxmltext-field""><P>Copyright © 2018World Business Council for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development</P><P>All rights reserved</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

												</DIV></DIV><DIV class=""meta""><SPAN class=""copyright"">© Frederick J. Weyerhaeuser / WWF</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><STRONG>Stockholm, Sweden</STRONG> – The impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> are most visible in the dramatic changes occurring to the planet’s freshwater resources, says a new report written by WWF for the World Bank.  
The report, Flowing Forward, finds both “visible” water such as rivers, lakes, precipitation, glaciers and snowpack, and water used for crops and livestock, health and sanitation services, hydroelectric and nuclear power as well as manufacturing and business are heavily influenced by <mark>climate change</mark>. 
“The very language of <mark>climate change</mark> — droughts, floods, desertification, famines, tropical cyclones — is the language of water,” says WWF-US CEO Carter Roberts. “Flowing Forward defines the methodologies that are necessary to sustain healthy economies and healthy ecosystems through water. Water is what unites us. And good water management is the tool we need to sustain development in the face of <mark>climate change</mark>.”
Effective water resource management is central to adapting our economies and societies to emerging <mark>climate</mark> conditions. But the uncertainty surrounding our future <mark>climate</mark> poses a major challenge to engineers and policymakers, especially when developing long-term water infrastructure development strategies. Flowing Forward marks the first comprehensive set of tools to achieve <mark>climate</mark>-<mark>sustainable</mark> water management.
“We can’t wait another 30 years for predictions to tell us how <mark>climate change</mark> is affecting freshwater resources. The threats are being felt now. The World Bank needs <mark>climate</mark> adaptation decision-making techniques, and it needs them now,” says Julia Bucknall, Manager for the World Bank’s Energy, Transport and Water Department.
Flowing Forward recognizes that sustainability in water management has become a moving target, and this is now the biggest obstacle to implementing solutions to the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>. 
“We can no longer assume that what is <mark>sustainable</mark> now will remain <mark>sustainable</mark> in 10 years, much less 50. So a shifting <mark>climate</mark> means that the rules for water management must change too. Our current model of ‘<mark>sustainable</mark> development’ is threatened by <mark>climate change</mark>. Engineers, policymakers and resource managers need new tools to prepare for more extreme floods and droughts, and we believe that ecosystems are the best scorecard to see how our cities farms, and economies are adapting to <mark>climate change</mark>.” says co-author John Matthews of WWF-US. 
“We need to design and operate dams, irrigation systems and energy production grids in ways that will help people and ecosystems adjust to emerging <mark>climate</mark> conditions together,” he adds. 
But report co-author Tom Le Quesne from WWF-UK says the report’s most critical finding is that water managers and policymakers already have most of the important tools to cope with <mark>climate change</mark> in hand: 
“The existing library of methods to manage river basins and water resources will go a long way in creating the conditions that will make our lakes, rivers and groundwater more <mark>sustainable</mark>. Our goal now is to help the water sector deploy tools that they already know work: environmental flows, Integrated Water Resource Management and the creation of monitoring networks.”

Though <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide does not cause <mark>climate change</mark> directly, its presence affects the abundance of greenhouse gases such as methane and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide.
</DIV></BLOCKQUOTE><P><mark>Carbon</mark> monoxide forms whenever <mark>carbon</mark>-based fuels—including coal, oil, natural gas and wood—are burned. As a result, many human activities and inventions emit <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide, including the combustion engines in cars, trucks, planes, ships and other vehicles; the fires lit by farmers to clear forests or fields; and industrial processes that involve the combustion of fossil fuels. In addition, wildfires and volcanoes are natural sources of the gas.</P><P>Little was known about the global distribution of <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide until the launch of the Terra satellite in 1999. Terra carries a sensor—<A href=""http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/MOPITT/home.html"" target=""_blank"">Measurements of <mark>Pollution</mark> in the Troposphere </A>(MOPITT)—that can measure <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide in a consistent fashion on a global scale. With a swath width of 640 kilometers (400 miles), MOPITT scans the entire atmosphere of Earth every three days.</P><P>Since CO has a lifetime in the troposphere of about one month, it persists long enough to be transported long distances by winds, but not long enough to mix evenly throughout the atmosphere. As a result, MOPITT’s maps show significant geographic variability and seasonality. To view month by month maps of <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide, visit the <A href=""http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/view.php?d1=MOP_CO_M"" target=""_blank""><mark>carbon</mark> monoxide page</A> in Earth Observatory’s <A href=""http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/?eocn=topnav&amp;eoci=globalmaps"" target=""_blank"">global maps</A> section.</P><P>In Africa, for example, agricultural burning shifts north and south of the equator with the seasons, leading to seasonal shifts in <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide. Fires are also the dominant source of <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide <mark>pollution</mark> in South America and Australia. In the United States, Europe and eastern Asia, the highest <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide concentrations occur around urban areas and tend to be a result of vehicle and industrial emissions. However, wildfires burning over large areas in North America, Russia and China also can be an important source.</P><DIV class=""image_module none"" style=""width:740px;""><FIGURE class=""inline_figure""><FIGCAPTION>
<mark>Carbon</mark> monoxide measurements taken by MOPITT in 2000. 
</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV>Terra has been in orbit long enough to observe significant changes over time. To illustrate how global <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide concentrations have changed, maps of the mission’s first (2000) and most recent full year (2014) of data are shown above. The maps depict yearly average concentrations of tropospheric <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide at an altitude of 3,700 meters (12,000 feet). Concentrations are expressed in parts per billion by volume (ppbv). A concentration of 1 ppbv means that for every billion molecules of gas in a measured volume, one of them is a <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide molecule. Yellow areas have little or no <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide, while progressively higher concentrations are shown in orange and red. Places where data was not available are gray. For both years, the data has been averaged, which eliminates seasonal variations.<DIV class=""image_module none"" style=""width:740px;""><FIGURE class=""inline_figure""><FIGCAPTION>
According to MOPITT, <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide levels have declined since 2000. 
</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV>According to MOPITT, <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide concentrations have declined since 2000. The decrease is particularly noticeable in the Northern Hemisphere. Most air quality experts attribute the decline to technological and regulatory <mark>innovation</mark>s that mean vehicles and industries are polluting less than they once did. Interestingly, while MOPITT observed slight decreases of <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide over China and India, satellites and emissions inventories have shown that other pollutants like <A href=""http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=82626"" target=""_blank"">sulfur dioxide</A> and nitrogen dioxide <A href=""http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/AirQuality/page5.php"" target=""_blank"">have risen</A> during the same period.<P>“For China, nitrogen dioxide emissions are mostly from the power and transportation sectors and have grown significantly since 2000 with the increase in demand for electricity,” explained Helen Worden, an atmospheric scientist from the National Center for Atmospheric Research. “<mark>Carbon</mark> monoxide emissions, however, have a relatively small contribution (less than 2 percent) from the power sector, so vehicle emissions standards and improved combustion efficiency for newer cars have lowered <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide in the atmosphere despite the fact that there are more vehicles on the road burning more fossil fuel.”</P><P>As illustrated by the maps, the news is also generally positive for the Southern Hemisphere, where deforestation and agricultural fires are the primary source of <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide. In South America, MOPITT observed a slight decrease in <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide; other satellites have observed decreases in the number of small fires and areas burned, suggesting a decrease in deforestation fires since 2005. Likewise, MOPITT has observed decreases in the amount of <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide over Africa. “There have been fewer fires in Africa, so that is a big part of the story there,” explained Worden. “However, growing cities might be increasing of the amount of CO in some areas of equatorial Africa.”</P><P>The line graph shows the long-term trend as well as monthly variations in <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide concentrations. While the overall trend is downward, several peaks and valleys are visible. For instance, some researchers attribute the peak from around 2002 to 2003 to an <A href=""http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/5/563/2005/acp-5-563-2005.html"" target=""_blank"">unusually active fire season</A> in the boreal forests of Russia. The dip in <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide emissions from 2007 to 2009 also matches a decline in global fire emissions. In addition, researchers have noted that this dip overlaps with a global financial crisis that started in late 2008 and caused global manufacturing output to <A href=""https://www.unido.org/fileadmin/media/documents/pdf/Publications/110905/WP062010_Ebook.pdf"" target=""_blank"">decline</A>.</P><P><EM>NASA Earth Observatory images by Jesse Allen and Joshua Stevens, using data from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the University of Toronto <A href=""https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/mopitt"" target=""_blank"">MOPITT Teams</A>.

Weyerhaeuser challenged a lower court ruling upholding a 2012 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decision to include private land where the frog does not currently live as critical habitat, potentially putting restrictions on future development opportunities. </P><P>The case pits property rights against federal conservation measures. The frog, found only in four locations in southern Mississippi, also previously inhabited Louisiana and Alabama. </P><P>The U.S. government identified the Louisiana land partly owned by Weyerhaeuser, which is based in Washington state, as meeting the criteria for the frog’s habitat under the federal Endangered Species Act. </P><P>“This was a decision that cried out for review,” said the company’s lawyer, Timothy Bishop, adding that federal law is “absolutely clear that critical habitat must first be habitat.”</P><P>The Fish and Wildlife Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </P><P>The agency’s critical habitat designation covered the tract of 1,544 acres (about 625 hectares) of private land in Louisiana as well as nearly 5,000 acres (about 2,025 hectares) in Mississippi. The owners of the Louisiana land filed a legal challenge to the designation, saying it would infringe on their rights to use the property as they see fit. </P><P>The frog has been listed as endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act since 2001. Critical habitat is defined as an area essential to the conservation of a species that may require special management or protection. </P><P>The Fish and Wildlife Service described the frog as darkly colored and moderately sized with warts covering its back and dusky spots on its belly. </P><P>The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the government in 2016. The Supreme Court, due to hear the case in its next term that starts in October, did not act on a similar appeal brought by owners of other parcels of the Louisiana land.  </P><P>In another endangered species case, the Supreme Court on Monday rejected a challenge to federal protections for a rare type of seal that were based on projections of future loss of habitat attributed to <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>In declining to hear appeals brought by the state of Alaska and industry groups, the justices left in place a 2012 decision by the administration of former President Barack Obama to protect a bearded seal subspecies that mainly lives off the coast of Alaska. </P><DIV class=""container_28wm1""><DIV class=""attribution_o4ojT""><P class=""content_27_rw"">Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

This growing population will increase the demand for food, putting further strain on global land and water resources already feeling the pressures of <mark>climate change</mark>. Responding to the urgency of these challenges, the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change brought together experts from academia and industry at a food symposium on November 5, “Feeding the World without Consuming the Planet.”</P><P>MIT Vice President Claude Canizares joined Joint Program on Global Change Co-Director Ron Prinn in opening the event. He highlighted MIT’s dedication to expanding research on agriculture, as urged by President Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology in a report published last December. He also emphasized the Institute’s long history of forming industry collaborations to confront the world’s greatest challenges.</P><P>“MIT’s 150-year history of being devoted to the industrial arts makes us very comfortable to work closely and in real partnership with industry. I can’t think of a more important problem for us to tackle,” said Canizares at the event, which included experts from Cargill, Coca-Cola Co., Mosaic Company, <mark>Weyerhaeuser Com</mark>pany, and Bunge Limited.</P><P>Cargill Vice Chairman Paul Conway also gave opening remarks outlining the challenges of increased food consumption, accelerating urbanization, demands for biofuels, and variability in <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>“We see <mark>climate change</mark> as a critical risk. We have to prepare ourselves to make sure we adapt,” said Conway, who also encouraged additional research in science and technology. “To ignore some tools that are available to us that have had a significant impact — particularly in terms of the reduction of chemicals — would be foolish.”</P><P><STRONG>Agricultural resources and inputs</STRONG></P><P>Joint Program Co-Director John Reilly kicked off the first session of the event with an overview of MIT’s work on modeling water stress, resource demands, variability in temperature, and precipitation patterns, and the economic impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on food prices.</P><P>“We need to better understand local and regional <mark>climate change</mark>s and extremes to improve agriculture,” said Reilly, of which the Joint Program is already studying with their Integrated Global System Model (IGSM) — a tool that connects earth and human systems to better predict future <mark>climate change</mark>s.</P><P>Industry is also doing its part to maximize yields and adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>. Reilly’s session focused on two key industries in particular: forestry and fertilizers.</P><P>As fertilizer companies meet growing productivity demands, they must focus on improving resource inefficiencies and misallocations of fertilizer in the developing world, said Michael Rahm of the Mosaic Company. Meanwhile, timberlands management could help mitigate <mark>climate change</mark>, according to Robert Ewing of the <mark>Weyerhaeuser Com</mark>pany. Weyerhaeuser is also working with Chevron to research how timber scraps could be used in biofuel production.</P><P><STRONG>Agricultural commodity markets, food, and consumers</STRONG></P><P>The second session of the event progressed up the food production chain and looked at the impacts on prices and trade. Describing the challenge of growing food prices, Professor Thomas Hertel from Purdue University said that there are many factors to watch including biofuel expansion, oil prices, technical capabilities, drops in research and development, and <mark>climate change</mark>. Hertel also explained income rises in the developing world will encourage diets to change and require more land intensive agriculture. Improved efficiency in trade and technology will be essential in meeting the demands of growing affluent societies.</P><P>Stewart Lindsey of Bunge Limited agreed with the importance of trade. “It plays a very important role in the world,” he said. “It really is a mechanism that gives deficit countries — countries that don’t have enough food to ensure security — the ability to do that in a pinch.”</P><P>Only 15 percent of global grains and oilseeds are exported today. By expanding global trade of agriculture, Lindsey suggested we should urge countries to be more efficient by growing and exporting foods based on their locally available resources and <mark>climate</mark> conditions.</P><P>As the food and agriculture industry continues to prepare for <mark>climate change</mark> and increased food demands by supporting agricultural trading, optimized yields, and <mark>sustainable</mark> agricultural practices, Reilly emphasized the important role of academia in such efforts.</P><P>“We look forward to continuing this conversation with collaborators in industry,” he said, “in order to improve our understanding of all these challenges, and find the best ways to adapt to our changing <mark>climate</mark> and resource demands.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></BODY></HTML>"

In comparison, a 1,000-kilowatt-hour coal plant emits 1,048 grams of CO<SUB>2</SUB> per kilowatt hour — 227 grams less than the biomass plant. </P><P>So when it comes to emissions, burning coal is technically more <mark>carbon</mark>-efficient than burning woody biomass.

The U.S. forest and paper industry is by far the world's largest, generating annual sales of $240 billion and accounting for 8 percent of total U.S. manufacturing output, according to the Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health.

By Drew Shindell — February 2007</P><P><mark>Carbon</mark> monoxide (CO) is a pollutant that affects methane, <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, and tropospheric (lower atmospheric) ozone. It thus plays a role in both air <mark>pollution</mark> and <mark>climate change</mark>, and is therefore regulated in many parts of the world. CO is unique among pollutants in the lower atmosphere in that it lasts for roughly a month, long enough for it to be transported long distances but not so long that it becomes distributed nearly uniformly. Further, it has been observed from satellites for several years. These features make comparison of modeled and measured CO a very useful way to evaluate our current understanding of and ability to model air <mark>pollution</mark>.</P><P>As part of an effort to study future air quality and <mark>climate change</mark>, a team of researchers from ten countries recently used 26 state-of-the-art atmospheric chemistry models to simulate present-day and projected near-future CO. We compared the present-day simulations with near-global observations from the Measurements of <mark>Pollution</mark> in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument flown on NASA's <A href=""http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/terra/"">Terra</A> satellite and with local surface measurements. The models show large underestimates of CO at middle and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, while typically performing reasonably well elsewhere (see figure).</P><DIV class=""floatcenter"" style=""width:520px""><P class=""caption""><B>Figure above:</B> Maps of <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide in the middle troposphere observed from MOPITT and the multi-model average, both in units of parts per billion by volume (ppbv, i.e., molecules of CO per billion molecules of air). The top row shows MOPITT observations from 2000, while the bottom row shows the equivalent for the average of the 26 models analyzed. Values in the upper right corner are the global mean area-weighted CO (ppbv). Grey indicates areas where satellite observations were not available.

</P></DIV><P>Detailed analysis of the results suggests that year-round surface emissions of CO, probably from fossil fuel burning in East Asia, and seasonal biomass burning emissions in South-central Africa, are greatly underestimated in current inventories used to drive models. Models appear to be able to reproduce many aspects of the transport and chemical transformation of CO in the atmosphere relatively well. However, variability among models is large. This is primarily due to model-to-model differences in simulating the hydrologic cycle and in representations and emissions of non-methane hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s, which can be chemically oxidized into CO. Better information on surface emissions and simultaneous observations of additional gases would clearly help resolve the limitations of current air <mark>pollution</mark> modeling revealed in this study.</P><P>Projections of the global average CO response to emissions changes in the year 2030 for three different scenarios are quite consistent among the models. Global average CO around the middle of the lower atmosphere increases by 16±4% for a high-emissions scenario, decreases by 11±3% for a low-emissions scenario, and changes by 2±2% for a mid-range scenario. Projected 2030 <mark>climate change</mark>s play a smaller role, decreasing the global average CO by 2±2%. Local changes can be much larger, however. These range from decreases of 10-15% over much of the industrialized Northern Hemisphere for the mid-range scenario to CO increases worldwide under the high-emission projection, with the largest changes over central Africa (20-30%), southern Brazil (25-40%) and South and East Asia (20-50%). The trajectory of future emissions thus has the potential to greatly influence air quality over most of the world's highly populated areas.</P><H4>Reference</H4><P>Shindell, D.T., G. Faluvegi, D.S.

Maria Cantwell (D-Wash) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) has potential to gain momentum on Capitol Hill, analysts say.</P><P>&quot;Companies are lobbying because they think the bill has legs or they want to ensure against the possibility that it does,&quot; said Kenneth Green, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think
                                tank.</P><P>Since the two senators introduced their bill in December, more than 40 businesses and organizations <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/billsum.php?id=114298&amp;lname=S.2877"">announced</A> plans to lobby on the measure
                                via official disclosure forms filed with Congress.</P><P>That came on top of dozens of corporations already <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/billsum.php?id=105753&amp;lname=H.R.1862"">advocating</A> on a similar &quot;cap-and-dividend&quot; bill introduced in the House of
                                Representatives.</P><P>The lobby list includes a slew of natural gas companies and coal-fired utilities who say they want to toss out the Senate legislation entirely or change its key provisions. The bill creates financial difficulties for their
                                industries or hurts regions of the country heavily reliant on coal, they say.</P><P>On the other hand, behemoths such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and the AARP are offering positive, if sometimes mixed, comments. Other companies like Duke Energy Corp. and <mark>Weyerhaeuser Co.</mark> are keeping quiet about their conversations
                                with lawmakers.</P><P><SPAN class=""bold"">A 'stand-alone' bill looking for 60 votes</SPAN></P><P>Supporters of the measure, which include many small environmental groups, are trying to counter the weight of opposition dollars through grassroots operations after meeting in Washington, D.C., in January to coordinate advocacy
                                efforts. They argue the bill has mass appeal because it is a simpler approach than cap-and-trade that blunts the influence of Wall Street traders and fills consumer pocketbooks.</P><P>&quot;The fact that I'm not a lobbyist and that many of the bill's supporters are not lobbyists contributes to the appeal of this bill,&quot; said entrepreneur Peter Barnes, the creator of the cap-and-dividend concept
                                who worked with Cantwell's office on the legislation.</P><P>A Cantwell aide said the office is &quot;meeting with dozens of industries.&quot; The senator plans to push the bill as a stand-alone measure, despite recent meetings with Sens. John Kerry (D-Mass), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)
                                and Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) who are working on separate global warming legislation, the aide said.</P><P>There was a &quot;misperception&quot; after the meeting that the senators agreed to some sort of compromise where competing legislative approaches would be merged into one legislative package, the aide said. Graham fueled speculation
                                by saying he thought an ultimate bill likely would be a hybrid of cap and trade and cap and dividend.</P><P>The Cantwell-Collins approach essentially takes the &quot;trade&quot; part out of cap and trade and returns most of the revenue raised by a bill back to consumers in the form of a dividend. A typical family of four would get
                                about $1,100 annually in payments, according to the senator's office.</P><P>The money would be raised by requiring companies extracting fossil fuels from the Earth to purchase &quot;<mark>carbon</mark> shares&quot; in a full auction for each ton of <mark>carbon</mark> they sell. The expectation is that those companies, such
                                as coal-mining companies or natural gas producers, would pass on the cost to buyers and everyone else in the economy as a signal to move to cleaner sources of energy.</P><P><SPAN class=""bold"">Cap but no trade</SPAN></P><P>Cap and trade, by contrast, puts a cap on emitters throughout the economy rather than just the &quot;upstream&quot; producers of fossil fuels. It also would allow complex trading by requiring capped entities to buy and sell
                                allowances to meet emission cuts.</P><P>The upstream cap in Cantwell-Collins is generating opposition from large gas producers that claim the cap penalizes them at a time of a credit crisis and limited cash flow. They say that they have little control over the price
                                of natural gas, and that if they have to pay for <mark>carbon</mark> allowances at a time when they can't sell gas at a high price, it will create financial difficulties for the industry.</P><P>&quot;The only way for us to deal with the additional costs in this bill is to reduce the amount of drilling for gas,&quot; said Chip Minty, a spokesman for Devon Energy Corp., the largest U.S.-based independent natural gas
                                and oil producer.</P><P>Many natural gas companies can't raise the selling price for gas because they are bound by long-term contracts, said Lou Hayden at the American Petroleum Institute. Some of the Institute's members like the dividend
                                part of the bill but are worried about the upstream cap, he said.</P><P>Yet the Cantwell aide said the bill addresses problems for the natural gas industry through language allowing companies in long-term contracts to modify the contracts.</P><P>The legislation also provides a grace period where companies can sell gas at a higher price -- if needed due to <mark>carbon</mark> regulations -- and use the resulting cash up to two years later to buy <mark>carbon</mark> allowances. That alleviates
                                worries about limited cash flow with gas companies in the early years of the program, the aide said.</P><P>The aide added the office is waiting for gas industry members to provide suggested text that they said &quot;could ensure that they could pass on the <mark>carbon</mark> share price&quot; and not absorb the costs of purchasing allowances.</P><P>But Minty at Devon Energy said he worried that companies never would be able to recover the cost from paying for the <mark>carbon</mark> shares, despite the grace period.</P><P>Barnes said the worries are overblown considering that the <mark>carbon</mark> shares would effect a small portion of the revenues of natural gas producers.</P><P><SPAN class=""bold"">An 'absolute daydream?'</SPAN></P><P>Other large companies also are criticizing the bill. In a December interview, American Electric Power CEO Mike Morris called it an &quot;absolute daydream.&quot; He expressed concerns that the money would never end up back
                                in people's pockets and would somehow be used to pay for other government spending.</P><P>&quot;Also, a cap-and-dividend approach would mean higher energy increases for residents and businesses in coal-dependent states more than those in the Northeast or on the West Coast, and the dividend likely wouldn't cover
                                the additional costs,&quot; said Melissa McHenry, a spokeswoman for American Electric Power Co., one of the nation's largest utilities. The bill currently envisions distributing dividends to consumers without exceptions
                                for regional differences in energy consumption.</P><P>Barnes countered that electricity prices account for only a part of the average person's energy costs. Consumers paying more for electricity in one region might be paying less for water, for example, so it's fairer
                                to have the same dividend for everyone, he said.</P><P>And even though some large companies oppose the bill, two entities with fat lobbying wallets -- ExxonMobil and the AARP -- are saying positive things about Cantwell-Collins.</P><P>Exxon likes its &quot;fresh approach&quot; and price collar, placing a lid and ceiling on <mark>carbon</mark> prices, even though the company prefers a <mark>carbon</mark> tax, said company spokesman Robert Young. The collar would create certainty for
                                businesses, Young said.</P><P>Similarly, AARP is planning to send a letter soon to Capitol Hill thanking Cantwell and Collins again for &quot;introducing their legislation and for their leadership in the <mark>climate change</mark> debate on behalf of consumers,&quot;
                                according to spokeswoman Mary Liz Burns. The organization is not endorsing the bill because it's not an environmental group, but believes &quot;elderly people need to be shielded from spikes in electricity costs,&quot;
                                Burns said.</P><P>Supporters of Cantwell-Collins, such as the Montana Environmental Information Center, are planning to push the bill &quot;through all forms of media,&quot; according to Executive Director Jim Jensen. Barnes, the creator of
                                the cap-and-dividend concept, said last week that proponents are writing letters and talking to members of Congress as much as possible.</P><P>The bill's backers argue that Cantwell-Collins offers a superior approach to controlling greenhouse gases than cap-and-trade bills circulating in Congress.</P><P>The cap-and-trade approach is seriously flawed because it relies on offsets, according to Barnes. Offsets allow companies to meet emission restrictions by paying for projects outside their own facilities, by say funding reforestation
                                projects in Brazil.</P><P><SPAN class=""bold"">A farewell to offsets</SPAN></P><P>That will never force the worst emitters to clean up their act, Barnes said. The cap-and-trade program enshrined in legislation that passed the House of Representatives last year made matters worse by offering financial breaks
                                to companies spewing a lot of greenhouse gases, he added.</P><P>There's no guarantee those companies will distribute money back to consumers, whereas a dividend will, Barnes said.</P><P>In a blog posting last week, Harvard University economist Robert Stavins offered mixed reviews of the proposal. He praised the upstream cap but said prohibiting <mark>carbon</mark> trading would reduce the efficiency of the program.</P><P>&quot;The Senators' approach is akin to responding to a tragic airplane crash by concluding that the best way to protect consumers from air disasters in the future is simply to ban flying,&quot; Stavins <A href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-stavins/any-hope-for-meaningful-u_b_457095.html"">wrote</A>.
                                He said the problems with the bill could be addressed &quot;while maintaining its basic structure and political attraction.&quot;</P><P>Meanwhile, some environmentalists are referring to cap and dividend as &quot;cap and divide&quot; because they don't believe it can garner a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate or control emissions sufficiently. Other
                                critics complain that offsets are needed to control costs in a <mark>climate</mark> regime or say the Cantwell-Collins approach doesn't provide enough money for the coal industry to develop technology to control its emissions (
                                <A href=""http://www.eenews.net/public/<mark>climate</mark>wire/2009/12/15/6""><mark>Climate</mark>Wire</A>;, December 15).</P><P>To opponents who say the coal industry needs cap and trade to help it develop and technology to capture and store greenhouse gases from power stacks, Barnes said he had no problem with Congress distributing money to coal, as
                                long as they didn't do it through a bill capping emissions.</P><P>&quot;If senators want to go ahead and pass an energy bill and start spending on this or that technology, that's fine,&quot; Barnes said. &quot;But keep the market mechanism that caps <mark>carbon</mark> clean and transparent. Don't
                                muck it up with stuff that will kill it.&quot;</P><P class=""note"">Copyright 2010 E&amp;E Publishing.

Fully understanding their separate and combined effects requires a mechanistic understanding at the local scale where their effects are ultimately realized.

We parameterized the model for four neighboring streams located in a forested headwater catchment in northwestern Oregon, USA with multi-year, daily measurements of stream temperature, flow, and turbidity (2007–2011), and field measurements of both instream habitat structure and three years of annual trout population estimates. Model simulations revealed that variability in habitat conditions among streams (depth, available habitat) mediated the effects of forest harvest and <mark>climate change</mark>. Net effects for most simulated trout responses were different from or less than the sum of their separate scenarios. In some cases, forest harvest countered the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> through increased summer flow. <mark>Climate change</mark> most strongly influenced trout (earlier fry emergence, reductions in biomass of older trout, increased biomass of young-of-year), but these changes did not consistently translate into reductions in biomass over time. Forest harvest, in contrast, produced fewer and less consistent responses in trout. Earlier fry emergence driven by <mark>climate change</mark> was the most consistent simulated response, whereas survival, growth, and biomass were inconsistent.

Although Rock Creek was the largest stream in watershed area, it had similar availability of habitat in summer relative to Gus Creek, which is half its watershed area. Gus Creek has the most variable flow in winter, and at times it exceeded flows in Rock Creek. Upper Mainstem was the coldest stream year-round, and it was the smallest in both watershed area and wetted summer area.

Although we calibrated inSTREAM to each stream using three years of trout population estimates from each field site, values of model calibrations were the same at three of the four streams, except for Upper Mainstem (<A href=""#pone.0135334.s004"" rid=""pone.0135334.s004"" class="" supplementary-material"">S1 Table</A>). Of the parameters considered in a sensitivity analysis (baseflow, benthic and drift food, summer temperature, hiding cover, piscivory risk, redd scour, spawning gravel, velocity shelter, winter temperature), biomass of adult trout was consistently sensitive to baseflow, with higher baseflows resulting in greater biomass of adult trout for these streams [<A href=""#pone.0135334.ref033"" rid=""pone.0135334.ref033"" class="" bibr popnode"">33</A>]. Although there are multiple stochastic elements in inSTREAM, it is not a highly stochastic model. Mortality is the main process represented stochastically. Other stochasticity occurs in initialization of model run (various aspects), assignment of length when trout emerge from eggs, whether a female that is ready to spawn does on an actual day, and mortality of eggs [<A href=""#pone.0135334.ref020"" rid=""pone.0135334.ref020"" class="" bibr popnode"">20</A>, <A href=""#pone.0135334.ref021"" rid=""pone.0135334.ref021"" class="" bibr popnode"">21</A>]. Hence, differences in replicate model runs represent natural variability and uncertainty in stochastic processes.</P><P id=""__p11"">InSTREAM captures many complexities of real streams. Within the inSTREAM environment, each study stream was represented as a reach (here, 210–250 m in length) made up of rectangular cells (here, 31–35 cells per reach). Reach-scale variables included flow, stream temperature, and turbidity, which varied daily. Each cell represented a unit of microhabitat from one to several square meters in area that had a specific depth, velocity, area of velocity shelter for drift-feeding, area of spawning gravel, and distance to hiding refuge. Stream depth and velocity varied daily with flow. Trout were represented as freely feeding individuals following emergence from gravel. Each trout was attributed with a length, weight, condition, and sex, and was assigned to a cell within which it feeds. Because trout were modeled as individuals, population dynamics emerged from the behaviors and fates of individual fish. The complete trout life cycle was represented in the model (redds, egg, fry, juvenile, adult). Redds were represented by both the number of eggs they contain and egg developmental status.</P><P id=""__p12"">InSTREAM operated at a daily time step following a set schedule of actions (in order: spawning, habitat selection, growth, survival, and egg development). At the start of each day, daily flow, temperature, and turbidity were taken from input files for each scenario, which are based on actual field observations. Depth and velocity for each habitat cell were updated based on the flow input. Hence, these daily updates allowed for changing environmental conditions corresponding to each scenario (see scenarios and model input sections for more details).</P><P id=""__p13"">Female trout spawn once per year if conditions, including date, flow and temperature thresholds, and female size, were met. When conditions for spawning were met, female trout moved to a cell with spawning gravel and created a redd. The number of eggs deposited increased geometrically as a function of spawner fork length. Each breeding adult (female and male) incurs a weight loss of 20% to represent energy loss due to reproduction. The model follows egg survival, development, and emergence. The developmental stage of eggs within a redd was a function of temperature degree days. Each day, the model updates developmental stage, determining how many eggs die due to processes such as temperature stress and disease, scouring, or desiccation. The timing of spawning was important because flow and temperature fluctuations, both high and low, influenced egg mortality. When surviving eggs within a redd were fully developed, they were converted into new trout, analogous to emergence and first feeding in nature.</P><P id=""__p14"" class=""p p-last"">All trout selected a cell and feeding activity to maximize short-term (90 day) fitness, which was a function of the growth and survival probability offered by each potential cell [<A href=""#pone.0135334.ref035"" rid=""pone.0135334.ref035"" class="" bibr popnode"">35</A>]. Habitat selection was executed in order of fish size, with the largest fish selecting cells first, representing a length-based hierarchy. The version of inSTREAM we used assumes that trout fed during daylight hours and competed for the food available in each cell [<A href=""#pone.0135334.ref020"" rid=""pone.0135334.ref020"" class="" bibr popnode"">20</A>]. Both metabolic and activity costs are subtracted from growth (net energy intake) and growth emerges as a function of trout size and habitat conditions (depth, and velocity). However, trout can also lose energy during spawning season (if they mature and if they spawn). Food intake was limited by food availability and the trout’s ability to capture food. Food availability depends on how much food was in each cell and how much was consumed by competing trout. The ability to capture food depends on trout size (with increasing length because larger trout see and swim better) and habitat conditions. There are two modes of feeding for trout, drift-feeding or search feeding. Food intake was represented with a drift-feeding approach where trout capture invertebrates as they are carried within range by the current. Search feeding is active searching for food. It is the primary feeding behavior for young-of-year and consists of 10–20% of food supply for adults [<A href=""#pone.0135334.ref036"" rid=""pone.0135334.ref036"" class="" bibr popnode"">36</A>]. The survival probability offered by a cell was determined by functions representing mortality due to predation by terrestrial animals, trout predation, disease and starvation, and high temperature. These functions depended on individual length and weight and on habitat variables. Hence, trout grew and survived according to growth rate and survival probabilities of the selected cell.</P></DIV><DIV id=""sec005"" class=""sec""><H3>Scenarios</H3><P id=""__p15"" class=""p p-first"">We designed this study to mimic changes in stream temperature and flows associated with separate and combined effects of forest harvest and <mark>climate change</mark>. In addition to these changes, we modeled a baseline scenario that mimicked the natural variability in temperature and flow observed from 2007–2011 at each stream. We generated 63 years of results for each scenario (duration explained in detail in section on model input). To account for two forest harvests on a 40-year rotation, we applied changes to stream flow and temperature due to forest harvest in years 1 and 41 for all of our analyses. To understand the influence of each environmental regime, we also compared the separate and combined effects of stream temperature and flow for each scenario.</P><P id=""__p16"">To model the effects of forest harvest, we comprehensively assessed information from recent forest harvest studies in the region. We used a conservative scenario of changes in magnitude and timing of stream temperature and flow. Accordingly, our forest harvest scenario represented a composite of current practices that include riparian buffers and a 40-year rotation. More generally, the literature suggested increased summer temperatures, increased summer flows, and increased flow from winter storm events for 1–2 decades following each harvest. Hence, for each cutting, we elevated stream temperatures for 15 years, with the first five years having daily mean stream temperature increased by 0.37°C [<A href=""#pone.0135334.ref022"" rid=""pone.0135334.ref022"" class="" bibr popnode"">22</A>] uniformly, followed by a gradual, linear decrease in daily mean stream temperature by 0.037°C each year for 10 years until recovery of baseline conditions [<A href=""#pone.0135334.ref025"" rid=""pone.0135334.ref025"" class="" bibr popnode"">25</A>]. Therefore, baseline temperature values were restored in year 16 and again in year 57 because that is when the forest canopy would be expected to be restored, providing shade to the stream. Responses of flow regimes to forest harvest are variable, but in the Coast Range of Oregon, alterations to flow regimes can last for 20 years with changes to storm events and seasonal low flows [<A href=""#pone.0135334.ref023"" rid=""pone.0135334.ref023"" class="" bibr popnode"">23</A>]. We increased daily water yield by 20% on the days when a storm event occurred that generated flow &gt; 2 standard deviations above the annual mean, because although water yield increases from forest harvest are highly variable, they generally increase by approximately 20% [<A href=""#pone.0135334.ref023"" rid=""pone.0135334.ref023"" class="" bibr popnode"">23</A>–<A href=""#pone.0135334.ref024"" rid=""pone.0135334.ref024"" class="" bibr popnode"">24</A>].

Measurements of habitat were completed and used to delineate cells. For each cell, we measured availability of velocity shelter and spawning gravel as well as distance to hiding cover. Depth, velocity, and water surface elevation of each cell were measured over a range of low, medium, and high flows from 2009–2010. We computed daily mean (arithmetic) of flow, stream temperature, and turbidity from field measurements recorded every 10 minutes from March 2007 to September 2011 in each of the four streams. Mean turbidity was measured using an instream nephelometer, which measures the scatter of a focused light beam by suspended solids. We evaluated multiple years of simulated data under each scenario (i.e., baseline, forest harvest, <mark>climate change</mark>, combined) for each stream. Because we had observations from only 2007–2011, we randomly selected the environmental regimes from one of those initial years every year for 67 years (a duration chosen for computational reasons). This ordering of years became the baseline scenario and was modified to create all alternative scenarios. Once the ordering of years was set for a scenario, then daily values of each environmental regime were read into the model. After we ran our scenarios, we ignored the first four years of data from all scenarios to eliminate initialization effects [<A href=""#pone.0135334.ref020"" rid=""pone.0135334.ref020"" class="" bibr popnode"">20</A>, <A href=""#pone.0135334.ref021"" rid=""pone.0135334.ref021"" class="" bibr popnode"">21</A>].

These are not separate but interwoven pursuits. It’s completely doable, and a conversation worth having.”</P><P>She holds undergraduate degrees from UC Berkeley in Economics and Public Law and a graduate degree from California State University, San Jose in Urban Planning.

And what can be done?
</ASIDE></HEADER><SECTION class=""copy""><P>
	It’s official. <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/science/earth-highest-temperature-record.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news"" target=""_blank"">Last year was the hottest ever recorded</A>. And if you think that sounds familiar, it’s because 2014 and 2015 each once held the same record. 2016 smashed 2015’s record by a wide margin, logging in at 1.69 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the twentieth century average.
</P><P>
	It might not seem like much to you – maybe you’re not a fan of cold weather – but here in Colorado, we kind of depend on abundant snow and the cool weather that makes it possible. After all, it powers a huge part of our economy.
</P><P>
	So in advance of our next <A href=""https://www.<mark>climate</mark>realityproject.org/training"" target=""_blank""><mark>Climate</mark> Reality Leadership Corps training</A>, taking place in Denver this March, we’re shining a spotlight on four major ways that residents of the Centennial State are seeing the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> <EM>right now</EM>.
</P><H3><STRONG>1. Heat</STRONG></H3><P>
	We’ll start with the obvious: thanks to <mark>climate change</mark>, Colorado is getting warmer. In fact, <STRONG>Colorado is one of the fastest-warming states in the country</STRONG>. The state’s annual average temperatures have already increased by 2 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 30 years, and looking forward, Colorado's average temperatures are expected to be one-and-a-half to two times greater than global averages, due in part to its latitude and geographical location far inland.
</P><P>
	That doesn’t just mean that our winters are warmer. Our summers are getting even hotter, too. And thanks to the <STRONG>urban heat island effect</STRONG>, our cities (Denver, in particular) are retaining even more heat.
</P><P>
	The results are, well, stressful, to say the least. Increases in heat can mean increases in serious illness and death. Additionally, increased heat can result in more air conditioning useage and higher electricity demand, energy system stress, and increased chances of brownouts and power outages. Without power, you can’t cool off. So infants and young children, people over 65, those already ill, athletes, outdoor workers, and residents of low-income neighborhoods are all especially vulnerable <STRONG>to illness and death resulting from heat stress</STRONG>. Excessive heat can also aggravate existing human health conditions like respiratory issues and heart disease.
</P><P>
	To top it all off, <STRONG>rising temperatures may reduce air quality</STRONG> by increasing the formation of ground-level ozone, which is a key component of smog. This may be problematic in areas such as Metropolitan Denver and the North Front Range, which struggle to meet the national ozone standards.
</P><H3><STRONG>2. Snowpack</STRONG></H3><P>
	You can guess what is next on Coloradan’s minds when it comes to increasing temperatures <SPAN style=""color: rgb(34, 49, 63); font-family: &quot;Noto Serif&quot;, serif; font-size: 19px;"">— </SPAN>snow!  </P><P>
	The mountains of Colorado receive nearly half of their annual precipitation in the form of snow. The state relies on regular, consistent snowfall to power its ski season and fill cool mountain springs with water for farms and residents alike.
</P><P>
	Unfortunately, most projections for Colorado’s spring snowpack show declines for the mid-twenty first century due to the projected warming, leading to a ripple effect on the water supply.
</P><P>
	The timing of snowmelt and peak runoff has already shifted earlier in the spring by one to four weeks as compared to the long-term average across Colorado’s river basins over the past 30 years. And since 2000, snowpack has generally been below average in all of Colorado’s river basins.
</P><P>
	Shorter, warmer winters are challenging outdoor recreation such as ice climbing and skiing. Ice climbing routes at popular local spots such as Silver Cascade are getting more unpredictable. Along with the other winter sports, a warming world threatens Colorado’s outdoor businesses, ski companies, and colleges that have traditionally emphasized outdoor education and recreation.
</P><H3><STRONG>3. Drought</STRONG></H3><P>
	With lower and lower levels of snowpack, we’re already seeing a “trickle-down” effect, resulting in drought.
</P><P>
	The Colorado River system is a vital source of water for agricultural and urban areas for more than 33 million people across Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, and Mexico. The river has experienced persistent drought much of the time since 2000. With Colorado’s population following urbanization trends and expected to potentially almost double in the next 40 to 50 years, the intensive ongoing water consumption does not fare well in the face of the <mark>climate</mark> crisis.
</P><P>
	In one study from 2014 quantifying the economic importance of the Colorado River, the anticipated direct loss for the State of Colorado was estimated at more than 1.1 million jobs and approximately $60.5 billion in labor income. This is assuming a shortfall in water availability of the Colorado River for one year with no other sources of water to compensate.
</P><H3><STRONG>4. Wildfires</STRONG></H3><P>
	Warm and dry conditions associated with the <mark>climate</mark> crisis may also increase the frequency and extent of wildfires across the Rocky Mountains. That’s because rising temperatures and earlier snow melt mean that forests are potentially drier for longer.
</P><P>
	We’re already starting to see the impact. <STRONG>Wildfire seasons are increasing in length</STRONG> and the number of large fires is increasing in the western US, which includes Colorado.
</P><P>
	Over 4,000 wildfires in 2012 led to record losses in Colorado. At least six people perished; 384,803 acres burned; 648 structures were destroyed; and $538 million in property losses resulted. The Waldo Canyon fire ranks among the top 10 costliest fires in the US with an estimated $450 million in losses.
</P><P>
	Then, in 2013, <STRONG>Colorado was listed as the third-most wildfire-prone state in the US</STRONG>. Nearly 374,000 households, or about 17 percent of the state’s total, were reported at high or extreme risk from wildfire.
</P><H3><STRONG>Help Colorado Confront the <mark>Climate</mark> Crisis</STRONG></H3><P>
	What can be done about the <mark>climate</mark> crisis? Well, first we need people like <EM>you </EM>to raise your voices and demand action in the state (and around the world) and support the expansion of solutions like renewable energy.

<BODY><P><A href=""/article/dn11462-<mark>climate</mark>-change-a-guide-for-the-perplexed""><B>See all <mark>climate</mark> myths in our special feature.</B></A></P><P><I>Water is a major greenhouse gas too, but its level in the atmosphere depends on temperature. Excess water vapour rains out in days. Excess CO<SUB>2</SUB> accumulates, warming the atmosphere, which raises water vapour levels and causes further warming.</I></P><P>Is water a far more important a greenhouse gas than <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, as some claim? It is not surprising that there is a lot of confusion about this – the answer is far from simple.</P><DIV id=""mpu-mid-article"" class=""mpu""><H5>Advertisement</H5></DIV><P>Firstly, there is the greenhouse effect, and then there is global warming. The greenhouse effect is caused by certain gases (and clouds) absorbing and re-emitting the infrared radiating from Earth’s surface. It currently keeps our planet 20°C to 30°C warmer than it would be otherwise. Global warming is the rise in temperatures caused by an increase in the levels of greenhouse gases due to human activity.</P><P>Water vapour is by far the most important contributor to the greenhouse effect. Pinning down its precise contribution is tricky, not least because the absorption spectra of different greenhouse gases overlap.</P><P>At some of these overlaps, the atmosphere already absorbs 100% of radiation, meaning that adding more greenhouse gases cannot increase absorption at these specific frequencies. For other frequencies, only a small proportion is currently absorbed, so higher levels of greenhouse gases do make a difference.</P><P>This means that when it comes to the greenhouse effect, two plus two does not equal four. If it were possible to leave the clouds but remove all other water vapour from the atmosphere, only about 40% less infrared of all frequencies would be absorbed. Take away the clouds and all other greenhouses gases, however, and the water vapour alone would still absorb about 60% of the infrared now absorbed.</P><P>By contrast, if CO<SUB>2</SUB> alone was removed from the atmosphere, only 15% less infrared would be absorbed. If CO<SUB>2</SUB> was the only greenhouse gas, it would absorb 26% of the infrared currently absorbed by the atmosphere.</P><P>A simplified summary is that about 50% of the greenhouse effect is due to water vapour, 25% due to clouds, 20% to CO<SUB>2</SUB>, with other gases accounting for the remainder.</P><H2>Water cycle</H2><P>So why aren’t <mark>climate</mark> scientists a lot more worried about water vapour than about CO<SUB>2</SUB>? The answer has to do with how long greenhouse gases persist in the atmosphere. For water, the average is just a few days.</P><P>This rapid turnover means that even if human activity was directly adding or removing significant amounts of water vapour (it isn’t), there would be no slow build-up of water vapour as is happening with CO<SUB>2</SUB> (see <A href=""/article/dn11638-<mark>climate</mark>-myths-human-<mark>co2</mark>-emissions-are-too-tiny-to-matter""><I><mark>Climate</mark> myths&amp;colon; Human CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions are tiny compared with natural sources</I></A>).</P><P>The level of water vapour in the atmosphere is determined mainly by temperature, and any excess is rapidly lost. The level of CO<SUB>2</SUB> is determined by the balance between sources and sinks, and it would take hundreds of years for it to return to pre-industrials levels even if all emissions ceased tomorrow.  Put another way, there is no limit to how much rain can fall, but there is a limit to how much extra CO<SUB>2</SUB> the oceans and other sinks can soak up.</P><P>Of course, CO<SUB>2</SUB> is not the only greenhouse gas emitted by humans. And many, such as methane, are far more powerful greenhouse gases in terms of infrared absorption per molecule.</P><P>While methane persists for only about a decade before breaking down, other gases, such as the chlorofluoro<mark>carbon</mark>s (CFCs), can persist in the atmosphere for hundreds or even tens of thousands years.

Fortunately, <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide is present in much smaller concentrations in the atmosphere. There is no question that <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide is a pollutant  with potential to harm all living things. But, does CO also affect Earth's <mark>climate</mark>? Unlike <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, a compound that contains the same atoms as <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide, <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide is not known as a direct contributor to <mark>climate change</mark>. It does, however, play a role in this area.<mark>Carbon</mark> monoxide is different than most pollutants. It can persist in the atmosphere for about a month and can be transported long distances. However, it is not uniformly distributed around the Earth. This <A href=""http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/shindell_09/"" target=""_blank"">NASA Science Brief on <mark>Carbon</mark> Monoxide</A> explains the issue further.Although <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide is only a weak greenhouse gas, its influence on <mark>climate</mark> goes beyond its own direct effects. Its presence affects concentrations of other greenhouse gases including methane, tropospheric ozone and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide.<mark>Carbon</mark> monoxide readily reacts with the hydroxyl radical (OH) forming a much stronger, greenhouse gas--<mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. This, in turn, increases concentrations of methane, another strong greenhouse gas, because the most common way methane is removed from the atmosphere is when it reacts with OH. So, the formation of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide leaves fewer OH for methane to react with,thus increasing methane's concentration.  A NASA report indicates that <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide is responsible for a 13% reduction in hydroxyl concentrations and through other reactions, a 9% drop in sulfate concentrations. Sulfates are credited for offsetting some of the global warming due to greenhouse gases by reflecting incident solar radiation back to space.Like many pollutants, <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide has both anthropogenic and natural sources. Natural sources include volcanoes and forest fires while human sources (which make up over half of all <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide produced) are mainly vehicle emissions and slash and burn agriculture, but also include some industrial activities.As automobile emission controls have improved in recent years, <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide emissions in western countries have decreased. However, a rapid increase in industrialization and in the number of automobiles in rapidly developing countries like China and India have resulted in increased <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide emissions in those countries.  Your team has been approached by an international foundation concerned about this increase. They are looking forward to your Earth System Science (ESS) analysis.Biomass burning is the burning of vegetation.  This burning includes fires started by lightning and fires started by humans.  The latter includes fires for the purpose of land clearing to increase agricultural areas or to get rid of the stubble from the previous year's <A href=""http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BiomassBurning/"" target=""_blank"">crops.</A>  NASA satellites are able to track the huge plumes of <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide resulting from these fires.  For example, during 2007, large portions of Southeast Asia were blanketed by the smoke from human-induced fires.  <B>Taskings </B><B>Basic </B>Large cities have traditionally been known for their high concentration of <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide due to the large concentrations of motor vehicles and other human induced sources such as cooking.  Mexico City is an example of a city known for its air's high levels of <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide.   In recent years, residents of rapidly developing countries such as China, India and Brazil have greatly increased their use and purchase of motor vehicles. This is being accompanied by an increase in <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide emissions. Your team has been approached by a multinational organization interested in researching the trends in Beijing.
