My main task going forward will be to make sure that we continue to operate safely and deliver on business goals while we adapt to new conditions, in parallel with the talks between LetterOne and BASF to merge DEA and Wintershall,&quot; says Maria Moraeus Hanssen.</P><P>Moraeus Hanssen joins DEA at a time where both the company and the oil and gas industry are facing significant changes. The changing energy markets are leading to structural changes, and early in December DEA’s owners LetterOne and BASF signed a Letter of Intent to merge DEA and Wintershall, creating a stronger Germany-based independent oil and gas company. Discussions towards a final agreement are ongoing. She underlines that the most important task for DEA is to continue running its production and projects in a way that creates value.</P><P>DEA’s new CEO expresses her pride of being part of the oil and gas industry, but acknowledges that the industry faces changes: “DEA’s most important asset is the competency of our employees, that will be of great importance also in a merged company. Over the years, DEA’s employees have shown an impressive ability to get the most out of the asset portfolio. By continuing and further developing these efforts, DEA will be able to adapt to a world with a more diversified energy market.”</P><P>Moraeus Hanssen: “It is not immoral to explore, develop and produce oil and gas. It is difficult and challenging, and for many, many years, oil and gas will still be a prerequisite for keeping the society going. Oil and gas companies' biggest challenge is still not declining demand, but how to find more oil and gas to compensate for the natural decline from existing fields.”</P><P>“We need to explore, develop and produce at lower costs, increased efficiency and with less impact on <mark>climate</mark> and environment. The oil and gas industry needs to take an active role in the ongoing energy transition. Digitalization and increased focus on technology throughout the business will be some of the levers to help us on this way”, she says.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""image-module module boundary""><FIGURE class=""watch-orientation ""><PICTURE><SOURCE srcset=""https://www.dea-group.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200_600/public/foto_von_maria_moraeus_hanssen_2.jpg?itok=_RKmehVH"" media=""(min-width: 1200px)""><SOURCE srcset=""https://www.dea-group.com/sites/default/files/styles/1024_512/public/foto_von_maria_moraeus_hanssen_2.jpg?itok=8wbj5qLf"" media=""(min-width: 1024px)""><SOURCE srcset=""https://www.dea-group.com/sites/default/files/styles/640_320/public/foto_von_maria_moraeus_hanssen_2.jpg?itok=mfX9z1F2"" media=""(min-width: 640px)""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption"">

By the end of 2015, <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/11/dow-chemical-dupont-merger-dowdupont"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Dow and DuPont announced</A> they were teaming up. Subject to regulatory approval, the new $130bn company – DowDuPont – plans to split into three parts, one of which will focus exclusively on agricultural chemicals and seeds and is set to command a hefty market share. It is estimated DowDuPont could account for <A href=""http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-dow-dupont-merger-would-raise-big-questions"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">around 40% of the corn and soybean seed market in the US</A>.</P><P>In February this year, ChemChina announced a $43bn purchase of Syngenta, bolstering ChemChina’s genetically engineered seed capacity and giving it the <A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-03/chemchina-offers-to-purchase-syngenta-for-record-43-billion"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">largest slice of the agricultural chemical market</A>. The remaining players – Monsanto, Bayer and BASF – are now under pressure to join the mega-merger dance, with talks on various potential permutations reportedly under way. </P><P>These proposed corporate mega-mergers are the result of pressure from financial investors. Years of low interest rates since the financial crisis have made corporate borrowing cheap and easy. But the onset of low agricultural commodity prices and faltering economic growth in emerging economies has weakened demand for commercial seeds and crop protection chemicals, making it harder for agribusiness firms to generate high returns for their shareholders, and to pay their debts.</P><P>Concerned about excessive borrowing and weak performance, investors have increasingly put pressure on agribusiness managers to improve their performance. In the case of Dow and DuPont, <A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-10/dow-chemical-dupont-a-merger-that-activist-investors-can-love"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">individual activist investors</A> – each managing enormous hedge funds for wealthy clients – pushed hard on these firms to cut costs through restructuring. Essentially, mergers and acquisitions have been the tools of choice to attempt to placate restless investors.</P><P>Regulators in the countries in which these firms are based are scrutinising the details of these deals, deciding whether to allow them to proceed. No doubt they are reviewing the mergers looking for evidence regarding traditional concerns about the effects of corporate consolidation – that it stifles competition, reduces <mark>innovation</mark> and can lead to a loss of tax revenue if the firm relocates its headquarters. These concerns merit close consideration, but there is so much more at stake.</P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-1 | 1""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">New index ranks Monsanto, Dupont and Syngenta on efforts to help smallholders</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P>For starters, mergers are likely to lead to higher costs of inputs for farmers. Already, the seed and chemical industries are highly concentrated. In 2013, <A href=""http://www.etcgroup.org/sites/www.etcgroup.org/files/files/etc_breakbad_23dec15.pdf"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">the top six firms controlled</A> 75% of the agrochemical market and 63% of the commercial seed market. If the number of firms drops, it will be that much easier for them to raise prices. </P><P>Consolidation in the agribusiness industry also tends to concentrate political power as giant firms lobby governments to shape the rules of the food system in ways that support their interests. <A href=""http://www.etcgroup.org/sites/www.etcgroup.org/files/Food%20Poster_Design-Sept042013.pdf"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">According to the non-profit, ETC Group</A> (pdf), small-scale farmers feed around 70% of the world’s population, and do so mainly with seeds saved from one harvest to the next rather than commercially purchased seed. Changes in government policies that favour big corporations’ desire for more large-scale industrial agriculture will directly threaten small farmers’ livelihoods.</P><P>Further spread of the industrial agricultural model is also likely to have devastating ecological effects. Large-scale, chemical-based monoculture farming is recognised as a major contributor to both <mark>climate change</mark> and <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/<mark>sustainable</mark>-business/food-system-monocultures-gm-un-diversity-day"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">biodiversity loss</A>, problems that pose significant threats to long-term food security. </P><P>If the proposed mega-mergers proceed, the food system will face profound changes in the name of increased short-term financial returns for relatively few investors. Ironically, there is <A href=""http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21695385-profits-are-too-high-america-needs-giant-dose-competition-too-much-good-thing"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">little evidence</A> to show that corporate consolidation is even economically productive in the long run. </P><P>A short-term financial boost for a handful of investors is hardly justification for allowing the mega-mergers when they threaten farmer livelihoods, the environment and long-term food security. </P><DIV class=""submeta""><SPAN class=""submeta__label"">Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It comes in several salt formulations and an acid formulation. It is a common herbicide used in getting rid of weeds and woody plants. Dicamba is sold under the names XtendiMax (Monsanto), Engenia (BASF), and FeXapan (DuPont).</P><P>New requirements for the use of dicamba &quot;over the top&quot; (above-ground spraying application to growing plants) will allow farmers to make informed choices for seed purchases for the 2018 growing season. The decision represented a victory for the biotech giants Monsanto, BASF and DuPont, as well as the farmers who want to use dicamba-based postemergents XtendiMax, Engenia or FeXapan.</P><P>Under the agreement with EPA, BASF, DuPont and Monsanto are making significant label changes for over-the-top dicamba product use. Key changes include:</P><P>With EPA’s approval, farmers are expected to plant even more dicamba-tolerant soybeans as part of next summer’s 2018 crop. Farmers planted approximately 20 million acres of dicamba-tolerant soybeans during the summer of 2017. Industry observers expect that number to double next year; so long as the demand for these agricultural commodities remains strong, the need to control difficult-to-manage weeds also will remain strong.</P><P><STRONG>CONTINUING CONCERNS OVER PESTICIDE “DRIFT” CONTAMINATION</STRONG></P><P>In the eyes of many farmers and farming experts, however, the new guidance and usage requirements on dicamba announced by the EPA do not address the problem of &quot;volatilization,&quot;<EM>i.e.,</EM> when dicamba evaporates from soil or plants where it was sprayed and drifts in unpredictable directions. Farmers across the Midwest and South, and now even in Northern states such as Minnesota and the Dakotas, are nervous about the continued use of dicamba because the pesticide has an established record of drifting into thousands of fields where it did not belong and damaging those crops.</P><P>Moreover, many independent scientists say that this vapor drift was a major cause of damage to neighboring fields this summer. For example, scientists with the Integrated Pest Management Department at the University of Missouri issued “<A class=""logclick ct_cont"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://qr.engage360.co/PREREGb1a25bf1-7794-4d76-b909-296d8a5adb73"">&quot;A Final Report on Dicamba-injured Soybean Acres&quot;</A> to provide a quantitative analysis of the extent of dicamba-injured 2017 crop soybeans throughout the United States, either in the form of official dicamba-related cases that currently are under investigation by the Missouri Departments of Agriculture, or as estimates of injured acreage from university extension weed scientists across America. The final report, issued on October 30, 2017, indicates that there are 2,708 dicamba-related injury cases currently under investigation by various state departments of agriculture around the United States.</P><P>The report also concludes that there were approximately 3.6 million acres of soybean that were injured by off-site movement of dicamba at some point during 2017. These numbers reflect an increase from previously-compiled data, primarily due to changes that occurred in some of the northern states like Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota.</P><P>While farmers have used dicamba for decades, it was only this past summer that they received permission to use it in a new way, spraying it over the top of soybean and cotton crops that Monsanto has genetically modified to tolerate the chemical. This meant that more dicamba was sprayed, and it was being applied in the heat of summer, which makes chemicals more likely to turn into a vapor and drift.</P><P><STRONG>WHAT’S AT STAKE</STRONG></P><P>Professor Robert Scott is a scientist in the Crop, Soil and Environmental Science Department at the University of Arkansas. Prof. Scott and several colleagues recently performed a series of experiments testing the volatility of dicamba’s transmission capacities. The scientists sprayed trays of soil with dicamba, then placed those trays in a field of soybeans far from any dicamba spraying. The soybean plants next to the dicamba-treated soil showed clear signs of exposure to the chemical. The results help explain why Arkansas farmers lodged more than a thousand complaints with state agriculture officials during the past year.</P><P>Dicamba drift or volatilization is problematic for many reasons. The obvious concern is contamination to fields that are cultivated under organic or <mark>sustainable</mark> conditions, without the use of chemical pesticides. Yet, an equally important concern is the impact of dicamba’s volatile transmission tendencies on a farmer’s decision regarding seed selection. Farmers who previously planted seeds that are pesticide free, but who are situated in proximity to neighbors that farm with dicamba, may be compelled to buy Monsanto's dicamba-tolerant seeds next year because those crops will not be vulnerable to windblown dicamba.</P><P>Monsanto continues to insist that vapor drift was not responsible for any of the damage that farmers saw this past summer. The company also rejects the concern that farmers are buying dicamba-tolerant seeds to defend themselves from neighbors who use dicamba. Rather, Monsanto contends that its dicamba-tolerant Xtendimax seeds are popular because they are high-yielding seeds.</P><P><STRONG>STATE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS ON DICAMBA USE</STRONG></P><P>In 2016, Missouri imposed most of the restrictions that the EPA is now requiring, and farmers in the state still saw widespread damage from drifting dicamba. Many state departments of agriculture are deciding whether they will impose any additional state requirements for the use of dicamba-related products.</P><P>The issue is about to reach a boil in Arkansas.</P><P>The Arkansas State Plant Board (ASPB) investigates complaints or allegations filed by citizens relating to alleged chemical misuse. Since 2015, the ASPB has worked to investigate and in some cases prosecute for a higher than normal volume of dicamba-related complaints.</P><P>As a result of those complaints, Arkansas banned dicamba use in July of this year for 120 days. The ASPB subsequently voted to approve regulatory changes for the application of products labeled for agricultural use that contains dicamba in Arkansas during its regularly scheduled quarterly meeting on September 21, 2017. The approved changes, if implemented, will prohibit the use of dicamba in Arkansas between April 16 and October 31 of 2018. The regulations provide exemptions for the use of dicamba in pastures, rangeland, turf, ornamental, direct injection for forestry, and home use.</P><P>As a matter of administrative procedure, the ASPB’s regulatory changes concerning the use of dicamba were subject to a 30 day public comment period, which ended on October 30, 2017. Over 25,000 comments were received by email and mail.</P><P>As a result of the extraordinary public interest, the ASPB will hold a <A class=""logclick ct_cont"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.aad.arkansas.gov/public-hearing-and-state-plant-board-special-called-board-meeting-little-rock"">special hearing</A> on November 8, 2017, to sift through public comments, receive additional input from stakeholders, and attempt to achieve a consensus regarding next steps for addressing volatilization concerns regarding dicamba. Following a growing season where nearly 1,000 off-target drift complaints were filed, expectations are for an abundance of speakers at the meeting offering vigorously-voiced and widely-diverging points of view.</P><P><STRONG>DICAMBA LITIGATION</STRONG></P><P>The decision made by Arkansas authorities could have national repercussions. Even in states where agriculture regulators decline to take action, negatively-impacted farmers are pursuing alternative legal remedies.</P><P>As agri-science continues to explore the impact of volatilization, injured farmers are filing lawsuits for losses caused by the herbicide’s over-the-top spraying that was not approved for on-crop use until late last year. Plaintiffs are contending that dicamba works for farmers who use it properly, but if their neighbors also do not use proprietary dicamba-resistant seeds, then the pesticide spreads to their fields ruining their crops.</P><P>Several law firms across the country have begun focusing on representing farmers injured by dicamba volatilization. Complaints typically claim that Monsanto and the other defendants deceptively marketed their latest dicamba formulations as “low-volatility” herbicides that would not be as prone to off-target movement. As a result, these lawsuits say that significant damage was done to millions of acres of American crops.</P><P>Not surprisingly, some plaintiff’s lawyers perceive the current dicamba situation as one that is best addressed through class action litigation. One example is the advertisement used by ClassAction.com attorney Rene Rocha, who filed a lawsuit against Monsanto, BASF, and DuPont in the Southern District of Illinois on behalf of Brian Warren, owner and operator of Warren Farms in Broughton, Illinois.</P><P>The Warren complaint alleges that in June and July of 2017, Mr. Warren observed cupping, curling, strapping, discoloration, leaf elongation, wrinkling, stunting, and twisting on his soybean and pumpkin crops. As a result, he sustained a loss of crop yield and will also sustain future losses.</P><P>The complaint goes on to state: “<EM>Numerous farmers within the vicinity of plaintiff purchased and planted Xtend variety soybean and cotton, and applied Xtendimax, Engenia, and Fexapan to their Xtend variety crops</EM>.” It also alleges that the neighboring farmers used the herbicides in the manner intended and expected by Monsanto, BASF, and DuPont, yet the resulting damage still occurred.</P><P>The lawsuit notes that there have been thousands of allegations of dicamba damage in dozens of states, and that “millions of acres of American crops have been damaged.” due to dicamba’s volatilization.</P><P><STRONG>TOWARDS WHAT END?</STRONG></P><P>Dicamba is just the latest in a long line of quandaries facing modern agriculture. At the heart of the dilemma is the correct balance between the demands for greater efficiency and yield versus the concerns over environmental integrity and safety.</P><P>As with the debate over GMOs, however, this dispute entails more than just the safety and purity of the crop itself. While many farmers choose to reap the benefits of insecticide-resistant seeds, others are determined to shun such genetically-engineered options. The issue posed by the current dicamba crisis is whether these two diametrically-opposed methods of farming can co-exist?</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

For the first  time ever, the independent sustainability research agency has identified a more than just slightly  upwards trend in its latest annual report on <mark>sustainable</mark> business governance around the globe. </P><P>One  of the possible reasons for this trend, which is most noticeable in the  midfield of the rated businesses, can be seen in the pressure to change  and the impulses for increased sustainability which are impacting  companies from many angles. These include international initiatives such  as the UN <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals (SDG), national regulations,  increasing demands of <mark>sustainable</mark> capital markets, and a general rise in  sustainability awareness. Businesses also need to respond increasingly  to transformation processes in the economy, e.g. de<mark>carbon</mark>ization in the  energy sector, and e-mobility in the automobiles industry. The study  shows clearly that not all industries are equally well prepared to face  these opportunities and challenges.

Accordingly, the government of the state willing to leave needs to notify the European Council of its intention and in return a qualified majority of the Council (without the requesting member state) needs to mandate the European Commission with the initiation of negotiations on an agreement for the future framework under which the relationship between the leaving member state and the European Union will be concluded. <A class=""weiter"" href=""index_en.php?content=news_20160624124213""> more...</A></P><H4>oekom research expands its presence to the US</H4><H4>2016/06/08</H4><P>ESG expert Ariane de Vienne to head future oekom office in New Yorkoekom  research, one of the leading international rating agencies for  <mark>sustainable</mark> investments, continues to expand its global reach and  establishes a subsidiary in the US.

This leaves them short of funds for the realisation of sovereign duties such as education, health and transport infrastructure. The (resource-rich) developing and newly industrialised countries, which the transfer of company profits to tax havens deprives of urgently needed tax revenues, are even more severely affected. Besides the loss of tax revenues, other negative effects of the existence and use of tax havens include the threat they pose to the stability of the international financial system and the support they provide for criminal and terrorist activities. <A class=""weiter"" href=""index_en.php?content=news_20140630173956""> more...</A></P><H4>oekom research Representation in London via an Exclusive Partnership with SI Partners</H4><H4>2014/05/26</H4><P>oekom research has established an exclusive partnership with <mark>Sustainable</mark> Investment Partners (SI Partners) to provide access to the London and UK market as part of its strategy to increase its global reach.

        Monsanto's Dicamba Problems Are Far From Over. Farmers File Another Lawsuit Over Drift Damage
    </H1></DIV><DIV class=""body js-expandable clearfix js-listicle-body js-update-url"" data-elid=""2445659441"" data-authors=""Lorraine Chow"" data-headline=""Monsanto's Dicamba Problems Are Far From Over. Farmers File Another Lawsuit Over Drift Damage""><DIV class=""body-description""><P>
	Arkansas farmers filed a class-action lawsuit last week against 
	<A href=""https://www.ecowatch.com/tag/monsanto"">Monsanto</A> and German chemical company <A href=""https://www.ecowatch.com/tag/basf"">BASF</A>, alleging that the companies' <A href=""https://www.ecowatch.com/tag/dicamba"">dicamba</A>-based herbicides caused damage to their properties.
</P><P>
	The plaintiffs 
	<A href=""http://www.arkansasmatters.com/news/local-news/monsanto-targeted-in-ar-farmers-lawsuit-over-dicamba/742339328"" target=""_blank"">claim</A> that Monsanto and BASF implemented and controlled the dicamba crop system, releasing seed technology without a corresponding, safe and approved herbicide.</P><P>
	According to <A href=""https://www.hoosieragtoday.com/arkansas-farmers-suing-monsanto-basf-over-dicamba/"" target=""_blank"">Hoosier Ag</A>: &quot;The farmers allege that Monsanto and BASF sold the dicamba crop system while knowing it could wipe out crops, fruits, and trees that are not dicamba tolerant. The farmers claim that those who do not plant dicamba tolerant crops are left with no protection from the herbicide.&quot;
</P><P><A href=""https://www.agweb.com/article/dicamba-ban-hangs-in-limbo-naa-chris-bennett/"" target=""_blank"">To date</A>, Arkansas' agriculture department has received 135 dicamba misuse complaints across 17 counties.
</P><P>
	The lawsuit comes as the Arkansas State Plant Board 
	<A href=""https://www.agweb.com/article/dicamba-ban-hangs-in-limbo-naa-chris-bennett/"" target=""_blank"">considers an in-crop dicamba ban</A> that was proposed by the state's pesticide committee. 
</P><P><A href=""https://www.ecowatch.com/monsanto-dupont-weed-killer-gmo-crops-1910876805.html"">The controversy</A> behind the pesticide started last year when Monsanto decided to sell its new dicamba-tolerant cotton and soybean seeds several growing seasons before getting federal approval for the corresponding herbicide. Without having the proper herbicide, cotton and soybean growers were suspected of illegally spraying older versions of the highly toxic and drift-prone chemical onto the seeds and inadvertently damaged nearby non-target crops due to drift.
</P><P>
	The spraying triggered widespread reports of 
	<A href=""https://www.ecowatch.com/monsanto-dicamba-1995121281.html"">crop damage across thousands of acres in 10 states</A> and <A href=""https://www.ecowatch.com/monsanto-lawsuits-dicamba-drift-2265408929.html"">several lawsuits</A> against pesticide makers. In October, a drift dispute between Arkansas farmers resulted in one farmer being shot to death.
</P><P>
	&quot;The dicamba crisis was created and forced upon the farming industry. Crops are at risk. Relationships are at risk. There have already been tragedies due to this crisis,&quot; Arkansas plaintiffs attorney Paul Byrd 
	<A href=""http://www.arkansasmatters.com/news/local-news/monsanto-targeted-in-ar-farmers-lawsuit-over-dicamba/742339328"" target=""_blank"">said</A>.
</P><P>&quot;Crops, fruits and trees that are not dicamba resistant were injured causing extensive damage to farmers' crops in Arkansas and other states throughout the 2016 growing season, including Alabama, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. Farmers' livelihoods are at stake, and we want to protect their interests,&quot; <A href=""http://www.arkansasmatters.com/news/local-news/monsanto-targeted-in-ar-farmers-lawsuit-over-dicamba/742339328"" target=""_blank"">added</A> attorney Phillip Duncan.
</P><P>
	Both companies sell dicamba-based herbicides, Xtendimax with VaporGrip by Monsanto and Engenia by BASF, for in-crop use on Monsanto's seeds that are 
	<A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/gmo-genetically-modified-organism/"" target=""_blank"">genetically modified</A> to resist the pesticide. These formulations are supposedly less drift-prone and volatile compared to older versions of dicamba.
</P><P>
	Along with Arkansas, agriculture officials in Missouri, Tennessee and Mississippi have either already received or are gearing up for more dicamba drift complaints this year, <A href=""https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/news/crops/article/2017/06/13/dicamba-drift-complaints-heat"" target=""_blank"">DTN</A> reported.
</P><P>
	&quot;We are here to support our customers and, if requested, can assist in investigating an off-target allegation in an advisory capacity to provide technical support,&quot; BASF told DTN.
</P><P>
	Monsanto told DTN that it is aware of media reports regarding off-target movement of dicamba, but is not willing to draw conclusions on the reports at this time and re-emphasized the importance of following all product labeling and local requirements.
</P><P>But the 
	<A href=""http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/"" target=""_blank"">Center for Biological Diversity</A> is calling for a ban of dicamba pesticides in Arkansas. </P><P>&quot;What we're seeing in Arkansas is proof of what we all already knew—that this dangerous, drift-prone pesticide is not safe to use,&quot; said Nathan Donley, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity. &quot;Assurances from pesticide makers that new dicamba products and tighter application regulations would end the drift problems that damaged hundreds of thousands of acres simply ignored reality.&quot;
</P><P>
	&quot;This dicamba crisis is only the latest evidence that dumping more pesticides on the landscape is a road to nowhere,&quot; Donley continued. &quot;And it's only going to get worse—Monsanto predicts that annual dicamba use on soybeans and cotton will jump from less than one million pounds just a few years ago to more than 25 million over the next three to four years.&quot;

It renders traditional risk management approaches – such as insurance, contingency funding or hazard mapping –  <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>analytics.org/blog/2018/preparing-for-the-suva-expert-dialogue-getting-loss-and-damage-right.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">unaffordable</A> for developing countries.<P>The calculation is simple: the more damages you experience, the higher your costs of reconstruction; the higher your risks, the costlier your risk transfer. International support is needed across the whole spectrum – enabling countries to assess and reduce their risks as well as then actually coping with losses in a <mark>sustainable</mark> and systematic manner.</P><P>The recent case of Antigua and Barbuda is illustrative of how countries cope and challenges they encounter in recovery from <mark>climate</mark>-related loss and damage. In 2017, Barbuda was hit by Hurricane Irma, a category 5 storm, which resulted in unprecedented displacement of the entire population and destruction of over <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/07/irma-destruction-island-by-island-hurricane"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">90% of its infrastructure</A>. In addition to loss of electricity and damage to housing, animal carcasses contaminated water supplies and increased the risk of spreading disease. The government declared a state of emergency, ordering <A href=""http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/article177687526.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">mandatory evacuations </A>of the island’s 1,500 residents to its neighbor island Antigua. Barbuda became uninhabited for the first time in over 300 years.</P><P>In the months following the storm, Barbuda remained <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/nov/20/the-night-barbuda-died-how-hurricane-irma-created-a-caribbean-ghost-town"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">largely unpopulated</A>, although many <A href=""http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/article177687526.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">residents longed to return home</A>. <A href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/hurricane-irma-might-bring-communal-ownership-of-barbuda-to-an-end"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Communal land ownership</A>, lack of home insurance and high percentage of renters- residents were either financially unable to rebuild or unclear about their role in the rebuilding process- added challenges to the extensive recovery efforts.</P><P>Government-led recovery efforts were also slowed by a desire to rebuild in a <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/nov/20/the-night-barbuda-died-how-hurricane-irma-created-a-caribbean-ghost-town"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">more <mark>climate</mark>-resilient manner</A>, rather than going back to business as usual. This approach required <A href=""http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/article177687526.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">more financial resources</A> than the government had available, while the already <A href=""https://countryeconomy.com/national-debt/antigua-barbuda"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">high national debt</A> disincentivised additional international borrowing of the more than US$200 million needed to rebuild. <A href=""http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/article177687526.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Debt relief, international aid and attracting private investment</A> to the island are viewed as the most feasible options for Barbuda’s recovery. However, this approach may lead to a <A href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/hurricane-irma-might-bring-communal-ownership-of-barbuda-to-an-end"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">loss of the traditional collective ownership of land</A> that has been in practice on the island since abolition of slavery in 1830.</P><P>What will the situation look like in the future? Studies have shown that half a degree increase in global temperature in the recent past has <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>analytics.org/blog/2017/half-a-degree-could-make-a-world-of-difference.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">resulted in substantial increases in extreme weather events</A>. Already at 1°C warming since the industrial revolution, warm spells have become significantly longer in half of all land areas and extreme precipitation – often leading to deadly flooding – has increased by at least 9% in a fourth of all land areas. The more we move outside the range of natural variability – the ups and downs that human and natural systems are used to – the more pronounced these changes are likely to be. And we know that changes are here to last. A <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>analytics.org/latest/sea-level-legacy-20cm-more-rise-by-2300-for-each-5-year-delay-in-peaking-emissions"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">recent study</A>has shown that each 5-year delay in peaking emissions leads to 20cm more sea-level rise in the long term.</P><P>But even just assessing the risks and scale of expected losses from <mark>climate change</mark> is the first big challenge for developing countries to prepare and cope with such situations like that which Antigua and Barbuda faces. A closer look at different loss and damage assessment methods shows why proper assessments are often missing in vulnerable developing countries.</P><P>Overall <A href=""http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2012/tp/01.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">methods</A> focus either on assessments in anticipation of <mark>climate</mark>-related events or after a specific event. Our <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>analytics.org/publications/2018/loss-and-damage-costing-and-financing-mechanisms-caribbean-outlook.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">overview</A> shows that both types of methods come with substantial challenges and are often not comparable due to the <A href=""http://repositorio.cepal.org/bitstream/handle/11362/38356/1/LCCARW7_en.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">lack of a baseline</A> which they could be compared against.</P><P>Analysis of different assessment methods exposes that developing countries in particular face limitations due to lack of available data and limited expertise in utilizing methods. In addition, most methods are not fit to analyse <A href=""http://loss-and-damage.net/download/7213.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">non-economic loss and damage</A> such as loss of life, displacement of communities or loss of social cohesion, which are relevant for the economy, especially in developing countries. Also, long-term impacts are often not included in assessing loss and damage after extreme events, due to time pressures when collecting data. Thus, lack of relevant methods and lack of data combined with scarce resources for proper assessment contribute to insufficient preparedness for the increasing risk of <mark>climate</mark> related disasters.</P><P>There are many gaps to fill when it comes to addressing loss and damage in developing countries. Facilitating risk assessments is but one important step to <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>analytics.org/blog/2017/big-change-after-the-big-storm-post-disaster-transformative-adaptation-in-small-island-developing-states.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">better prepare</A> for the inevitable.</P><P>Yet being able to estimate future losses does not mean countries will be in a position to shoulder these losses themselves. The International Monetary Fund in its <A href=""https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2018/03/20/world-economic-outlook-april-2018"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">2017 World Economic Outlook</A> clearly states that while domestic policies and national adaptation strategies can reduce impacts for developing countries, “the international community must play a key role in supporting these countries’ efforts to cope with <mark>climate change</mark>—a global threat to which they have contributed little”.</P><P>Developing countries have contributed little to <mark>climate change</mark> and are in no position to cope with resulting loss and damage by themselves. They lack the adequate resources – including data and capacities – to develop and implement solutions. <mark>Climate change</mark> further undermines their abilities to fill those gaps. The questions of feasibility, affordability and responsibility are thus key when scoping and devising solutions to loss and damage in developing countries and should be front and center during the Suva Expert Dialogue.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Conventional breeders and genetic engineers are both trying to make arabica coffee plants more robust.</DIV><DIV class=""credit"">Credit: Coffee World Research</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Mark Dunhill, CEO of English coffee, tea, and cocoa retailer Whittard of Chelsea, is obsessed with sourcing the finest ingredients. His kitchen brims with parcels of dark chocolate and tea caddies full of exotic varieties.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>But Dunhill’s even bigger obsession appears to be coffee. Every 10 days, a silver pouch packed with freshly grown and roasted coffee beans arrive from countries such as Guatemala, Tanzania and the Congo. He carefully weighs and grinds the beans before pouring them into an espresso machine that hisses as it delivers <A href=""https://cen.acs.org/articles/91/i5/Caffeine-Jitters.html"" title=""Caffeine Jitters"">caffeine</A>-powered perfection.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>For Dunhill, as for most of the world’s billion or so coffee drinkers, coffee has to be made with beans from <I>Coffea arabica</I>—a shrub discovered hundreds of years ago in the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia—or not at all. To switch to the bitter beans of <I>C. canephora</I>, also known as robusta, would be anathema.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>“Arabica beans provide a radically different and infinitely more pleasurable drinking experience,” Dunhill says. Robusta is typically relegated to instant coffee.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Unfortunately for the <A href=""https://cen.acs.org/articles/91/i13/Appreciating-Coffee.html"" title=""Appreciating Coffee"">coffee world</A>, arabica is also genetically predisposed for extinction. Cultivated arabica plants have a genetic diversity of just 1.2%, compared with more than 20% for crops such as rice and soy, making it less able to adapt to changing conditions. And it is a fragile, weakling of a variety that is susceptible to disease, including coffee leaf rust caused by the fungus <I>Hemileia vastatrix,</I> and pests such as the coffee borer beetle.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Compounding the problem, <mark>climate change</mark> in coffee-growing areas is forecast to increase stress on arabica, making it more vulnerable to pests and disease.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Stirred to action, coffee producers are working to protect arabica by crossbreeding it with more resilient <I>Coffea</I> varieties. But a debate on the rescue plan is heating up, with some scientists criticizing crossbreeding for being slow and inaccurate. They say genetic modification is the best way to ensure arabica does not go the way of the Gros Michel, a tasty species of banana wiped out by a fungus in the mid-20th century.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Coffee breeders reject this notion as well as any increased reliance on pesticides. They are counting on crossbreeding and better farming techniques to ensure arabica’s survival.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Time isn’t on arabica’s side. A leaf rust epidemic that began around 2008 wiped out large tracts of production across Central America. As long ago as 1890, rust killed off most of the arabica plants in Sri Lanka, until then a major coffee supplier to the U.K. It forced Sri Lankan growers to start growing tea, a move that is widely believed to have turned England into the nation of tea drinkers it is today.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>According to research published by London’s Royal Botanic Gardens last year in the journal <I>Nature Plants</I> (2017, <A href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nplants.2017.81"" title=""10.1038/nplants.2017.81"">DOI: 10.1038/nplants.2017.81</A>), <mark>climate change</mark> will make up to 60% of the growing land in Ethiopia—a major supplier—unsuitable for coffee cultivation by the end of the century.</P></DIV><DIV class=""htmljswidget section""><DIV style=""background-color: #e5efc1; width: 40%; float: left; padding: 10px; margin: 6px 10px 6px 2px;""><DIV style=""color: #618724; font-size: 20px; margin: 2px 0px;""><B>Spilling the beans on <I>Coffea arabica</I></B></DIV><P>Drugs in the news over the past five years offer case histories on medical break- throughs, research shortcomings, regulatory uncertainties, and pricing mayhem.</P><P><B><SPAN style=""color: #618724;"">▸</SPAN> 5.8 million metric tons:</B> Production in 2017<B><SPAN style=""color: #618724;"">▸</SPAN> 1.2%:</B> Arabica’s genetic diversity<B><SPAN style=""color: #618724;"">▸</SPAN> 15%:</B> Share of production lost to rust<B><SPAN style=""color: #618724;"">▸</SPAN> 10–14 days:</B> Time it takes for rust to appear after first infection.<B><SPAN style=""color: #618724;"">▸</SPAN> 1990:</B> Year coffee leaf rust became a global problem<B><SPAN style=""color: #618724;"">▸</SPAN> 40%:</B> Share of Colombia’s coffee crop wiped out in 2008 by rust<B><SPAN style=""color: #618724;"">▸</SPAN> 3 billion:</B> Number of trees Colombian growers have had to replant since 2008.</P><P><B>Sources:</B> The American Phytopathological Society, International Coffee Organization, London’s Royal Botanic Gardens.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Across the world, arabica crops are already being “chased up the hillside” to cooler climes, says World Coffee Research, an organization set up in 2012 by coffee producers to protect and enhance supplies of quality coffee. WCR has since begun a program to breed a resilient variety of arabica. Coffee retailers such as Starbucks have also introduced programs to breed arabica with greater disease resistance.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>WCR is working with experts around the world to identify wild arabica relatives in Ethiopia, or varieties maintained in agricultural institutes, that resist disease such as rust and crossbreed them with the weakling varieties we get our coffee beans from today.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>The group has already created 46 arabica hybrids designed for enhanced resistance to fungal diseases and is now testing them in the field. It plans to introduce the best performers commercially in 2023.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>WCR’s scientific director, Christophe Montagnon, acknowledges that the main focus is disease resistance and that heat tolerance won’t be bred into arabica soon.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>“It is very unlikely that we find now the very plant that will be necessary in 2050. We are improving the coffee populations step-by-step,” Montagnon says.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>But the crossbreeding advocated by Montagnon is not just slow but also somewhat clumsy, according to some scientists. “They are basically trying to breed a racehorse with a donkey. And it takes many, many years of backcrossing to get rid of the donkey,” says Brande Wulff, crop genetics project leader for the U.K.’s John Innes Centre, whose grandfather happened to be a tea grower in Sri Lanka.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Genetic engineering is a quicker and more effective alternative to crossbreeding for heat tolerance and disease resistance, Wulff argues. “With genetic modification, you can go to the wild relatives, identify resistance genes that matter, take them out with molecular tweezers, and stick them straight into your elite material to clinically combine the best of both worlds,” he says.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Lessons already learned from applying genetic engineering to other plant species should be transferable to arabica, Wulff suggests. “Resistance genes are like eyes that see the presence of the pathogen, and when they detect a pathogen, they can turn on defense mechanisms,” he says.</P></DIV><DIV class=""articlemedia parbase section""><DIV id=""cen-09607-bus2-curst-gr2"" style=""width:704px"" class=""article_image_box no_border bottomMargin""><DIV class=""article_border""><DIV><DIV id=""media_modal_cen-09607-bus2-curst-gr2"" class=""media_modal_image""><DIV class=""imagePopup""><DIV class=""description"">Arabica plants struggle against fungus, as seen here, and against rising temperatures.</DIV><DIV class=""credit"">Credit: Coffee Buyers Club</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""article_image_text""><DIV class=""text"">
Arabica plants struggle against fungus, as seen here, and against rising temperatures.</DIV><DIV class=""credit"">Credit: Coffee Buyers Club</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Techniques such as CRISPR can be used to change a single or a few base pairs of DNA, but Wulff says traditional genetic engineering approaches are required to incorporate a full resistance gene, which is typically 30–100 DNA base pairs long.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>A fungus might generate millions of spores, of which just one has a mutation that enables it to overcome a plant’s resistance. Two resistance genes would reduce the probability of the pathogen’s success to one in 1 trillion. Each new resistance gene can increase the odds against the pathogen’s success 1 million times. “If you introduce a stack of five genes, it should be durable for 100 years,” Wulff says.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>The cost of cloning disease-resistance genes has tumbled in recent years and now stands at roughly $70,000 per gene. And the work could be done in a few months. “So it is becoming much more affordable to clone these agronomically important genes,” Wulff says.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>University of California, Davis, researchers brought genetically modifying arabica coffee a step closer to reality in early 2017 when they released the genome sequence for the plant. “This new genome sequence for <I>C. arabica</I> contains information crucial for developing high-quality, disease-resistant coffee varieties that can adapt to the <mark>climate change</mark>s,” said UC Davis geneticist Juan Medrano, researcher on the sequencing effort, at the time of the publication.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>But WCR, which has the backing of more than 30 coffee-producing organizations, maintains that genetic modification is not an option. “The coffee world and story is not yet compatible with genetic modification,” Montagnon says diplomatically. Indeed, at this time there is no genetically modified coffee on sale anywhere in the world and no major plan under way to introduce it.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Wulff admits that genetically modified coffee would face social and regulatory challenges. The big agricultural companies are the only ones that can afford the multi-million-dollar regulatory costs required to bring such a product to market, he says.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>In the absence of genetic modification, three of the world’s biggest agrochemical firms—BASF, Bayer, and Syngenta—say they have pesticides and other technologies that will protect arabica.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Syngenta has introduced NuCoffee, a package of services that support best practices in coffee cultivation, including pesticide-use protocols. The approach is leading to significantly higher yields for coffee crops, says Daniel Bachner, a senior crop protection executive at Syngenta in Brazil.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Meanwhile, BASF says it has begun offering coffee producers a variety of the mineral kaolin, which forms a dusty coating that puts off pests while also protecting against sunburn and keeping plant canopies cooler. Named Surround, the material doubles bean yields in coffee bushes, according to Peter Barrows, international business director for BASF subsidiary TKI.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>BASF is also targeting leaf rust with an array of pesticides. “We are planning to launch a host of new products across all indications by the end of the decade,” BASF says. One example is Revysol, a triazole-based antifungal that the firm hopes will be its next blockbuster fungicide.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>WCR isn’t fond of these approaches either. “I don’t believe the solution is in pesticides,” Montagnon says. “I believe—and other scientists do—that we should be looking more at plant health.” Good use of fertilizer and farming practices such as promoting shade can be more efficient than the use of pesticides to protect rust-susceptible coffee plants, he argues.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Montagnon points to studies, including one being undertaken by Jacques Avelino, a plant pathologist at the French agricultural research institute CIRAD. According to Avelino, who has been studying coffee cultivation for 30 years and is an adviser to WCR, farming practices that promote shading of arabica bushes can be highly effective at reducing rust and other diseases.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>Scientists like Wulff warn that farming improvements and crossbreeding, however well meaning, could fail to fight off <mark>climate change</mark>, pests, and disease. Consumers will then be forced to make a choice: Either switch to bitter robusta or wake up and smell the genetically modified coffee.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>But Montagnon, who himself has 28 years of experience in breeding coffee plants and has published more than 100 articles on the subject, is confident that a combination of crossbreeding and better farming practices is the best way of ensuring arabica’s survival.</P></DIV><DIV class=""parbase section rtetext""><P>He’s also confident this approach will produce the exquisite-tasting coffee that consumers demand. Whittard’s Dunhill, among others, will be hoping that Montagnon is right and that shiny pouches of freshly roasted arabica beans will drop onto his doormat for years to come.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""clear""> </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In the wake of Monsanto the German company Bayer has become one of the largest agricultural corporations in the world. Already, Bayer is one of the leading suppliers of pesticides and seeds. A current enquiry at the European Patent Office shows that in terms of the number of GMO patents Bayer actually comes first.</P><P>Maize, wheat, rice, barley, soy, cotton, sugar beet, rapeseed, potatoes, tobacco, tomatoes, grapes – the list of transgenic plants, on which Bayer Cropscience owns patents, is long. The corporation has even taken out patents on genetically modified trees, for example poplars, pine trees and eucalyptus. This is the result of an enquiry by the Coalition against Bayer Dangers and No Patents on Seeds! at the European Patent Office (EPO) in Munich, Germany. For this purpose the initiatives scrutinised all patent applications submitted by Bayer over the last 20 years. According to the investigation the company owns 206 of the total number of 2,000 patents on transgenic plants issued in Europe. This puts Bayer in the number one spot – even before Pioneer (179), BASF (144), Syngenta (135) and Monsanto (119).</P><P><STRONG>Increasing market concentration</STRONG>
With an international market share of 20 percent Bayer Cropscience, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bayer AG, is the second largest pesticide producer in the world (after Syngenta). For seeds the company is in seventh place with a market share of 3 percent. The concentration process in the agricultural market has been ongoing for decades. The ten biggest corporations own a market share for pesticides and seeds of over 70 percent. It is the aim of this oligopoly to carve up the market amongst itself, dictate prices, steer the political framework and ultimately control how humanity will grow food. “If you control the oil you control the country; if you control food, you control the population,” former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger once remarked. To this end patents on plants and animals are an essential means. Already in 2008 the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD), initiated by the United Nations and the World Bank warned that research and dissemination of knowledge is being restricted by the increasing registration of patents. Especially in developing countries this would prevent locally adapted agricultural practices contributing to food security and economic sustainability.</P><P><STRONG>Increasing use of herbicides</STRONG>
Monsanto is the biggest supplier of genetically modified seeds in the world – by a long way. The corporation has acquired dozens of smaller seed producers and cultivators, thus achieving a share of the seed market of around 27 percent. The US company is also way ahead with the package deals with herbicides and GMOs: 95 percent of GMO soy and 75 percent of GMO plants, such as maize or cotton, are resistant to the pesticide glyphosate (trade name: Roundup) developed by Monsanto. Studies suggest that the use of this agent can cause birth defects as well as cancer. More and more farmers and farm workers are being poisoned, especially in Latin America. Contrary to the constant promises made by industry, the application of genetically modified plants has not decreased the use of pesticides in any way, but instead caused it to continually increase. Public criticism directed at Monsanto is therefore totally justified. This is a comfortable situation for the German companies Bayer and BASF because it means they are hardly the subject of public debate. However, the Bayer pesticide glufosinate, chemically related to glyphosate and also supplied in combination with herbicide-tolerant seeds, is just as dangerous. The active agent can cause deformities in foetuses and is therefore classified as a reproductive toxin. That is why the substance must be withdrawn from sale in the EU by 2017 at the latest. This has not prevented Bayer from announcing in May 2013 to build a huge new glufosinate factory in the USA. With this the corporation wants to close the gap caused by the increasing inefficacy of glyphosate against weeds.</P><P><STRONG>Bayer is taking over</STRONG>
When it comes to “green GMO technology” Bayer has been catching up steadily. Since the 1980s the corporation has been carrying out research with genetically modified plants. In 2001 it rose to the top league through the takeover of Avenetis Cropscience, which itself was created out of the GMO divisions of Schering, Rhone Poulenc and Hoechst. Then Bayer bought companies such as Plant Genetics Systems, Planttec, Prosoy Genetics and Athenix. In addition it entered into cooperation agreements with biotech companies such as Evogene (research on rice), Mertec (soy) and Futuregene (cotton) as well as research institutes such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (wheat) and the Brazilian Centre for Sugarcane Technology. Currently Bayer achieves its highest sales with cotton seeds, where the company holds 18 GMO patents. Bayer also supplies genetically modified rapeseed, sugarcane, maize and soy. It is already ten years since the company applied for a EU import licence for their herbicide resistant rice LL62.</P><P><STRONG>206 GMO patents by Bayer</STRONG> The current enquiry shows that Bayer has submitted a total of 771 applications at the European Patent Office (EPA) in the last twenty years. These were accepted in 206 cases (see table). Not one but two German companies were in the lead with the number of patents issued in the last three years: BASF (69) and Bayer (56). Bayer holds 26 patents solely for starch and sugar. Its aim is to produce starch for industrial use through genetically modified plants. Genetic modification is also a means to produce specific kinds of sugar for special applications. 23 Bayer patents are in relation to resistances against herbicides. The patents on glufosinate are partially from the 1980s and have expired by now. To extend the duration Bayer has made small changes to the DNA of important plants such as soy and cotton and applied for new patents on them. Since the patent on the Monsanto product glyphosate has expired as well, Bayer is now producing this agent itself and is holding ten own patents on glyphosate technologies. For example, patent number EP 1994158 describes a glyphosate resistance process for which Bayer has registered claims on as many as 23 different plants. These include maize, wheat, barley, soy and rice, various trees and even grass.</P><P><STRONG>Contamination scandal</STRONG>
In August 2011, Bayer received an EU import permission for glufosinate-resistant soy of the type known as A5547-127. This type of soy will be grown mainly in South America and imported to Europe as animal feed. Only a few months earlier, the company had been given a patent on this soy bean, which will be valid until 2026. The patent will also give the company the exclusive right to test seeds for contamination with this genetically modified type of soy, which might be intended to prevent independent testing. A glufosinate-resistent plant was also responsible for the biggest contamination scandal in the history of genetic engineering so far: in 2006, genetically modified rice of the type LL601 turned up in supermarkets all over the world, even though there was no permit whatsoever. Slightly more than 30% of the crop from the US was contaminated. The EU and Japan stopped all rice imports from North America. In 2012 Bayer had to pay compensation fees of more than $900 million to the farmers who were affected by this. LL601 still exists and is regularly detected in conventionally traded rice.</P><P><STRONG>Terminator patents</STRONG>Farmers have been producing their own seeds for thousands of years. They have created types of plants that are optimally adapted to local conditions. This self-perpetuating method is obviously problematic for the large seeds producers. The agricultural giants’ worst trick against the free reproduction of seeds is so-called “terminator technology”: this means that a genetic modification causes the plants to become sterile after one single sowing, forcing farmers to buy new seeds every year. All of the large agricultural companies perform research into “terminator” seeds and have registered patents in this field. Having taken over the company Hoechst Schering Agrevo GmbH (later Aventis), Bayer also owns “terminator” patents. They are called, for example, “Process for Producing Plants with Female Sterility”. Terminator plants are not currently used, as there has been a moratorium due to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity since 2000. However, this moratorium is not legally binding. There have been several attempts to weaken the ban. If they were successful, it would be an immense threat to biodiversity and to the food security of millions of people who live only on agriculture – especially in developing countries. Therefore, environmental initiatives from all over the world demand a permanent ban on this technology and also of relevant patents.</P><P><STRONG>Patent swap</STRONG>
Despite the large number of patents and co-operations, Bayer’s genetic engineering programme is mainly based on only two techniques: first, herbicide-resistant seeds sold in combination with the pesticides glufosinate or glyphosate; second, plants that contain the poisonous bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which kills insects. Both methods have been on the market since the 1990s. Due to the dangers they cause to humans and the environment, the Coalition against Bayer Dangers demands that glufosinate and glyphosate must be taken off the market immediately. Since the genetically modified plants are losing more and more of their effect, Bayer has exchanged many patents with Monsanto, Dupont, Syngenta and DOW. The companies now also use methods of their competitors and offer seeds that are immune to two or even three herbicides. In 2012, a type of soy was introduced that was tolerant of glufosinate, glyphosate and 24,D (the latter was part of the defoliant Agent Orange). Monsanto has even recently applied for an EU import permission for “Smartstax” sweetcorn, which is not only immune to glufosinate and glyphosate, but also contains six Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins.</P><P><STRONG>Patents for conventional plants</STRONG>
Over the past 25 years Bayer and others have not managed to shake the European consumers’ scepticism towards genetic engineering. BASF has given up and moved its entire GMO research to the US. In addition, the prophecies made about genetic modification have turned out to be incorrect. Yields did not rise significantly, and the use of pesticides was not reduced. For all of those reasons, Bayer is now intensifying its use of conventional methods of growing plants again. However, conventional growing is only profitable if the company has patent rights for it, so Bayer aims to obtain these – and has previously been successful. In August 2011, the European Patent Office granted a patent for growing plants with increased resistance to stress (patent EP1616013). The patent is valid until 2024. Stress factors are, for example, dryness, bright light, heat or scarcity of nutrients. Just over 100 of 2,000 plant patents issued by the European Patent Office are for such conventionally grown plants. It is also common to take plants that were grown conventionally and genetically modified later, since obtaining a patent right is easier this way. By issuing such patents, the EPO approves of grown plants being declared an “invention” and genetic resources being monopolised. This shows that international patent law has changed significantly.</P><P>Both the Strasbourg Patent Convention in 1963 and the European Patent Convention in 1977 excluded property claims relating to “essentially biological procedures”. Breeds of animals or plants or animal and plant species were not considered inventions that deserved protection – the purpose of this decision was to protect life processes from becoming trading goods. This would have made it almost impossible for genetic engineering to become a profitable economic sector. Therefore the lobby groups of Bayer and others did their utmost to reinterpret the laws through legal trickery. Their breakthrough came in 1980, when a US patent office issued a copyright for a bacterium, arguing that it was much more similar to a lifeless chemical compound than to a horse, bee or raspberry. It went swiftly on from there. In 1988, Harvard University succeeded in gaining intellectual property rights on the so-called OncoMouse (a mouse that is especially susceptible to cancer) and immediately entered a licence contract with the pharmaceutical company DuPont.</P><P>Nowadays the European Patent Office even issues property rights for conventionally grown plants. However, there is a glimmer of hope. During its last meeting before the summer break, the German Parliament decided to change the German patent law to ban the granting of intellectual property rights to conventionally-bred animals and plants. It is true that this law will not affect the practices of the EPO, but hopefully other countries will follow suit and ban patents for living organisms.</P><P><EM>This text is taken from the website of the German Coordination gegen BAYER-Gefahren: <A href=""http://www.cbgnetwork.de/5242.html"" target=""_blank"">http://www.cbgnetwork.de/5242.html</A></EM></P><P>Number of patents issued by the European Patent Organisation 1.

That’s when you’d quickly run after it, attempting to catch it, but you never could. Today, it’s almost impossible to imagine that your children or grandchildren might not get to experience the same in a few years.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Populations of the monarch butterflies have plummeted by approximately 90 percent in the last 20 years and continue to decline.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Due to inclement weather in Mexico, the annual population<A class=""externalLink"" href=""http://monarchwatch.org/blog/2017/02/11/monarch-population-status-30/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> report</A> for<I> Danaus Plexippus </I>shows a 27 percent decrease in 2017 from the previous year’s population.</P><P>“That’s a red flag and researchers who study the conservation of monarchs say that it’s going to take all of us pitching in to change this trend,” said Karli Moore, Ag Professional Development Program, BASF, in an interview.</P><P>What makes these North American species unique is that most of them fly north from central Mexico in spring and summer, up through central and eastern parts of the U.S. and even into Canada over the summer. During the migration, adult female monarchs lay eggs solely on milkweed plants. When the eggs hatch, the resulting larvae feed on milkweed leaves.</P><P>As this iconic creature’s existence continues to be in jeopardy, research points to three reasons for the population decline:</P><UL><LI>Habitat interference in Mexico (where they spend their winters)</LI><LI><mark>Climate change</mark> and severe weather, such as the extended<A class=""externalLink"" href=""http://texasbutterflyranch.com/2016/03/13/at-least-1-5-million-monarch-butterflies-perish-in-deadly-ice-storm-in-michoacan"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> drought</A> in Texas during their migration through the Lone Star state, which makes it difficult for adult butterflies to find milkweed and nectar plants</LI><LI>Loss of milkweed habitat, since milkweed, a warm-season perennial, is the sole plant that caterpillars eat</LI></UL><P>Some skeptics have honed in on the third point and say that agriculture is responsible for the milkweed loss due to new technology and effective control measures used by growers in getting weeds out of crop areas. That’s when BASF stepped in and decided to be part of the solution.</P><P>“Due to a perception that habitat loss was responsible for declining populations, we felt it was important to determine how the agricultural community could develop additional habitat in non-crop areas,” said Burleson Smith, Regulatory Affairs Manager, BASF, who’s been involved in this project from the start.</P><P>BASF launched a biodiversity research initiative called<A class=""externalLink"" href=""http://agro.basf.us/living-acres/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> Living Acres</A> two years ago in Holly Springs, N.C., in hope of increasing the monarchs’ population by<A class=""externalLink"" href=""https://www.usgs.gov/news/more-milkweeds-located-throughout-landscape-can-help-conserve-monarchs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> planting milkweed</A> in non-crop areas, such as ditches, roadsides, alleyways and border areas. The objective was to provide information to farmers about planting milkweed in non-crop areas in an economic and practical manner. BASF followed up this effort by spreading the word on social media this year and launching the<A class=""externalLink"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/BASF.LivingAcres/app/?sk=app_234658916574732"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> Monarch Challenge</A> on Facebook, encouraging farmers to sign up to receive a free milkweed starter kit and grow the plants to increase biodiversity. More than 1300 farm families signed up, exceeding BASF’s 500 goal for the year. BASF sent out 500 milkweed starter kits, consisting of 18 milkweed seedlings, which totaled 9,000 milkweed seedlings this year.</P><P>Aside from being a monarch larvae’s sole food, milkweed is also slightly toxic to most animals and insects, save for the monarchs, who metabolize it and incorporate it into their bodies, which protects them from danger. Research efforts have shown much better long-term success when milkweed plots were started with seedlings or root cuttings rather than seeds, according to Laura Vance, Living Acres Biology Representative, BASF.</P><P>As BASF’s initiative continues to gain more traction and corporations, such as agricultural company<A class=""externalLink"" href=""http://www.chsinc.com/our-company/news-and-media/news/2017/05/01/chs-inc-accepts-the-basf-monarch-challenge"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> CHS</A>, and universities started getting involved, the chemical company decided to go the extra mile and extend the Monarch Challenge to professional and specialty solutions businesses, such as turf grass customers. In June, the challenge included its first golf course—North Carolina State University’s Lonnie Poole. Volunteers from the college and BASF’s crop protection division in Raleigh collaborated to plant a variety of milkweed plants.</P><P>According to Moore,</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“Golf courses have ample opportunity to create quality habitat for pollinators and monarchs.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>“They cover large amounts of area and they already have the capacity to maintain their ground, so approaching them about small changes, like adding milkweed and nectar plants is not an issue.”</P><P>About 750 milkweed plants and wildflowers were planted in low-impact areas of the golf course in hopes of establishing monarch habitat.</P><P>BASF’s goal with this initiative is to show how modern agriculture can coexist with refuges for monarchs and play an important role in promoting biodiversity of wildlife future generations.</P><P>“Now when I look at a garden, I see it totally different than I did before,” Vance added. “I look at which insects are on which flower, and then where are they going. It connects you more with this larger cycle.”</P></DIV><FOOTER><DIV class=""td-post-source-tags""><UL class=""td-tags td-post-small-box clearfix""><LI><SPAN>TAGS</SPAN></LI></UL></DIV></FOOTER></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Biotechnology Research and Information Network AG (“BRAIN AG“, “the Company” and together with its subsidiaries “BRAIN” or “the Group”) is preparing an initial public offering (“IPO“ or “the Offer”) in the Regulated Market (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.</H3><P>BRAIN AG is one of Europe’s leading technology companies in the field of industrial biotechnology, the core discipline of the Bioeconomy. Using proprietary technology platforms, the Company identifies previously untapped, efficient enzymes, microbial producer organisms or bioactive natural substances from all that biodiversity has to offer to put them into industrial or rather bioeconomical use. The innovative product solutions developed by the help of this “Toolbox of Nature” are successfully applied in the chemical industry as well as in the consumer goods, cosmetics, animal feed, and food industries. To secure its technologies and product candidates, BRAIN AG holds more than 350 patents and patent applications divided in 48 patent families.</P><H2>Clearly focussed business model</H2><P>BRAIN’s business is based on two pillars - “BioScience“ and “BioIndustrial“.</P><P>The “BioScience“ pillar comprises the Company’s – frequently exclusive - collaboration business with selected globally active industrial partners. Since its foundation, BRAIN AG has successfully entered into more than 100 of such long-lasting industrial partnerships. Basically, these involve BRAIN providing research and development services aimed at sustainably improving processes or at identifying new products and technical solutions harnessing the methods of industrial biotechnology. To this end, the Company receives a combination of running research and development fees, milestone payments, performance payments and license fees from the respective industrial partner. Among these collaboration partners are companies such as BASF, Bayer, Clariant, DSM Nutritional Products, Evonik, Fuchs Europe, Henkel, Nutrinova, RWE, Südzucker, or Symrise.</P><P>The second pillar of BRAIN’s business, “BioIndustrial”, comprises the development and commercialisation of its own products and active product components. In order to promote the underlying industrialisation strategy, BRAIN AG targets rapidly growing market segments such as enzymes, food, wound care, or BioSubstitutes (biological substituents for chemical ingredients) as well as cosmetics and care products within the consumer goods market. For these target markets, the Company has built an extensive product pipeline intended to contribute significantly to its future sales growth.</P><P>These products and active product components are either marketed by granting licenses to third parties or by acquiring companies which are already active in the relevant markets. In this pillar of the business, BRAIN thus participates in the market through own product sales, or by license payments and royalty payments linked to the licensee’s final product sales.</P><P>In fiscal year 2014/15, the Company has acquired a majority interest in a well-established manufacturing and sales company – WeissBioTech – for the enzyme and food target markets. In earlier years, BRAIN AG had already acquired two other industrial enterprises providing both the required manufacturing capacities and market access to end consumers (B2B, B2C) within the market for cosmetics and care products.</P><H2>Consistent growth strategy</H2><P>More than 20 years of experience in the industrial collaboration business have paved the way for BRAIN AG’s consistent expansion over the past few years. During the same time period, BRAIN has established robust contacts to the industry, the scientific and academic community and political bodies in order to be accepted and act as a key enabler in the change towards a bio-based economy.</P><P>After the adoption of its industrialisation strategy in 2008, the Company had a special focus on investing into and scaling up its own product pipeline. In addition, the Company was sustainably strengthened through selective corporate acquisitions which were successfully integrated into the value chain and well positioned in attractive markets.</P><P>BRAIN’s strong growth path is also reflected in the Company’s financial development. The Group’s operating performance (sales revenues + changes in finished goods and work in progress + other income including R&amp;D grants) increased by a compound annual growth rate of 59 per cent, from EUR 10.2m to EUR 25.7m, between the 2012/13 and the 2014/15 fiscal years. A significant portion of this growth is attributable to the “BioIndustrial“ division, where the operating performance increased by an average of 68 per cent per annum from EUR 4.8m to EUR 13.5m, over the same period. Consequently, already today, this business pillar accounts for more than half (53 per cent in fiscal year 2014/15) of the Group’s operating performance. The Group’s EBIT remained almost stable in absolute numbers, with EUR -4.4m in 2012/13 and EUR -4.6m in 2014/15, while margins improved over time. The different relations between the absolute revenue and earnings developments is due to the significant increase of Research &amp; Development capabilities on the one hand, and the initial consolidation of WeissBioTech on the other hand, which does not yet include the expected earnings potential from the use of BRAIN’s product pipeline.</P><P>BRAIN AG sees future growth opportunities mainly in the expansion of its BioArchive, the so-called “Toolbox of Nature”. This is how the Company intends to secure additional rights to use and exploit biotechnology solutions. In addition, the Company continues to pursue its “multi-product opportunity“ approach, which is based on the fact that one innovative solution developed by BRAIN may often be used and monetised in different market segments in parallel.</P><P>Finally, BRAIN AG plans to further expand its business activities in the “BioScience“ division with its collaboration partnerships. It also aims to extend its “BioIndustrial” activities on a more global scale, i.e. beyond the German-speaking countries and Europe.</P><P>To be prepared for this next level of growth especially in view of the additional tasks in the product business, the BRAIN management team has been strengthened and equipped with more responsibilities during the last year. The Management Board, led by its Chairman Dr Jürgen Eck, who belongs to the group of BRAIN shareholders since 1994, was complemented by Henricus Marks (COO), who has more than 25 years of industry experience, in particular in global sales operations and key account management particularly in the enzyme business. In addition, Dr Georg Kellinghusen, former member of the BRAIN Supervisory Board, was appointed CFO with effect from January 01, 2016. The experienced management team, now consisting of ten people, is highly motivated to make a significant contribution for BRAIN and the biological transformation of the target industries.</P><H2>Offer for institutional and private investors</H2><P>The planned offer primarily consists of newly issued shares from a capital increase; meaning, the Company will receive all the proceeds from these primary shares. Besides, one existing shareholder is planning to provide shares to be used in an over-allotment option.</P><P>ODDO Seydler Bank AG is acting as Sole Global Coordinator and Bookrunner in the transaction. Blaettchen Financial Advisory GmbH is supporting the Company as IPO consultant.</P><P>Some 51 per cent of BRAIN AG’s current equity capital is held by the family office of MP Beteiligungs GmbH and around 20 per cent is owned by MIG, a group of venture capital funds. The remaining around 29 per cent are primarily in the possession of the Company’s founders and senior management. These existing shareholders will continue to hold a significant equity portion after the planned IPO.</P><P>The Offer will consist of initial public offerings in Germany and Austria as well as private placements in certain jurisdictions outside of these countries and outside the United States of America. With the aim to adequately target retail investors, BRAIN wants to reserve some 10 per cent of the offered shares for this group of investors. Plans are being made to provide dedicated subscription channels – also via the Company itself - for this particular purpose.</P><P><I>“Over the past few years, we have built up an excellent reputation within the research community, political bodies and the relevant industry players, and have realised successful collaboration projects. We have also made good progress with our industrialisation strategy - thanks to successfully integrated acquisitions on the one hand and the expansion of our product pipeline on the other hand. Now we are ready to increase our independence on the financing side, in order to properly benefit from the tailwinds in our industry. The planned IPO will bring the expansion of our Company an important step forward”,</I>says Dr Jürgen Eck, Chairman of the Management Board (CEO) of BRAIN AG.</P><P>The Company intends to use the proceeds from the IPO primarily to fund the research and development of new products, to continuously improve and upgrade existing products and technologies, and to enhance the marketing of its own product pipeline. Some portion may also be dedicated to finance further acquisitions or to increase stakes in certain subsidiary companies, if this supports the implementation of the Company’s industrialisation strategy. Finally, a small portion of the proceeds shall be used for working capital requirements and the repayment of shareholder loans granted for operational purposes.</P><H2>Increased sustainability through Bioeconomy</H2><P>Bioeconomy involves using resources from nature such as microorganisms, enzymes or individual biomolecules in industrial production processes amongst others, to achieve significant improvements compared to conventional processes or products. This results in, for instance, more resource-friendly, energy-efficient and <mark>sustainable</mark> processes in the chemical, mining and consumer goods industries, or more natural products in the food, animal feed and cosmetics industries. How such a bio-based economy needs to be built, was recently discussed in Berlin on the “Global Bioeconomy Summit”. This international event, initiated by the bioeconomy council of the German government, attracted more than 700 participants from 82 states at the end of November 2015. Shortly after, on 30 November 2015, negotiations started on legally binding universal targets for sustainability and resource efficiency within the scope of COP21, also known as the 2015 Paris <mark>climate</mark> conference.</P><P>Industrial biotechnology as harnessed by BRAIN is considered a key technology in the transition from an economy that is frequently based on fossil fuels into a <mark>sustainable</mark> and biology-based economy. In politics and industry, the term often used for this is “the biologisation of industries”.Against this backdrop, BRAIN AG perceives the global population growth, scarcity of resources, <mark>climate change</mark> as well as consumers’ needs for natural solutions in food and cosmetics products as major growth engines for products based on biotechnological processes and solutions. Another key driver identified by the Company is the increasing cost of healthcare, which can be reduced through the development of healthy foods.</P><P><I>“BRAIN is rethinking biology. The technological use of biological processes in an industrial environment reflects the Company’s core competence and philosophy. Inspired by the vision of a bio-based economy or so called Bioeconomy that is geared to natural material cycles, BRAIN is one of the creative players in this global transformation process“,</I>explains Dr Jürgen Eck when asked about his long-term view of the industry and BRAIN’s role in it.</P><P>The Company aims to facilitate and expand the use of biotechnology solutions and biological products, and intends to service both the industrial and the end consumer markets. A particular growth potential is seen in large parts of the chemical industry. Here, BRAIN AG focuses on the specialty chemicals and the consumer chemicals divisions, with an emphasis on nutrition, cosmetics and wound care. According to a scientific publication from the Journal of Commercial Biotechnology (Festel et al., 2012), experts expect the share of biotechnology products and procedures in the chemical industry to grow from approximately 12 per cent today to up to 20 per cent by 2020. In this environment, the two aforementioned market divisions BRAIN focuses on are expected to grow at an annual rate of 15.5 per cent. According to CEFIC, the European Chemical Industry Council, total sales in the chemical industry in 2013 already amounted to some EUR 3,156 bn worldwide, with a growth forecast of approximately 4 per cent per annum.</P><H3>About BRAIN</H3><P>BRAIN is one of Europe’s leading technology companies in the field of industrial biotechnology, the core discipline of Bioeconomy. As such, BRAIN identifies previously untapped, efficient enzymes, microbial producer organisms or natural substances from complex biological systems that can be put to industrial use. The innovative solutions and products developed by help of this “Toolbox of Nature” are successfully applied in the chemistry, the cosmetics and the food industries. Today, BRAIN’s business model is based on two pillars – “BioScience” and “BioIndustrial”. The first pillar, “BioScience”, comprises its – frequently exclusive – collaboration business with industrial partners. The second pillar “BioIndustrial” comprises the development and commercialisation of BRAIN’s own products and active product components.</P><H3>Disclaimer</H3><P>This document and the information contained herein are for information purposes only and do not constitute a prospectus or an offer to sell securities in the United States or a solicitation to purchase such securities in the United States.

BASF’s Chairman Kurt Bock, an advocate of shale gas exploitation in Europe, swatted aside questions about the <mark>climate change</mark> impact of shale gas on the basis that most people in the world still get their energy predominantly from fossil fuels so it should be okay for BASF, too.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">And this, just minutes after holding up a car part made from BASF’s engineered plastic and exclaiming that it is lighter than the metal it was designed to replace and so would improve fuel efficiency and hence the environmental performance of vehicles.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">Given that there is broad scientific consensus on anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>, it shows how leading chemical companies such as BASF – one of the world’s most innovative companies – is potentially both part of the solution and still part of the problem. And that’s a business model set to attract greater scrutiny as scientific understanding about anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> sharpens.</P><DIV id=""attachment_679"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">LIGHTWEIGHT: BASF’s Kurt Bock shows off lighter car components made from its engineered plastic but the firm has yet to roll out “holy grail” processes such as those that use <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide as a raw material.</P></DIV><P class=""MsoNormal"">The struggle for companies like BASF remains one of doing better for people and planet while also making money for shareholders. Right now the s</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">hareholders appear to be winning. The shift to truly <mark>sustainable</mark> technologies seemingly is too expensive or too difficult – or both. Yes new technologies are being developed, but by and large the pace of change is incremental. And being less bad for the environment doesn’t qualify as <mark>sustainable</mark>.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">As Bock mentioned in Ludwigshafen, truly <mark>sustainable</mark> processes such as those that consume <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide remain the “holy grail” of the chemical industry. But as Bock also noted it was too early for him to be able to provide details about BASF’s activities in this field because they haven’t been sufficiently developed.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">On the one hand BASF and many other chemical companies could be blamed for this state of affairs: They make a profit and only pay the current value for</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">their raw materials, such as fossil fuels. The next generation will pick up the full (and hidden) costs, including those resulting from <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">On the other hand, all chemical companies are working in the best way that they can within the current regulations and that means staying as profitable as they can, otherwise they might not survive at all.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">A potential solution for breaking this deadlock is to markedly accelerate <mark>innovation</mark> in <mark>sustainable</mark> processes by creating closer ties between academia, industry and government. Government should step up its role of funding R&amp;D for <mark>sustainable</mark> processes, and additionally provide tax breaks and a tax regime that is attractive enough for chemical companies to make the early investment in R&amp;D for truly <mark>sustainable</mark> (not less bad) processes without going broke.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">The need for closer ties between chemical firms and academia and government was a central theme taken up by a panel of experts meeting in the past week at the Royal Society of Chemistry in London as one of the best ways for “future-proofing” chemical companies and the users of chemicals. “Just in the U.K. we throw away the same number of <mark>carbon</mark> atoms that we spend £1.5 trillion [$2.5 trillion] buying in this country,” said industry veteran Ian Shott, who among his other roles is head of the Scotland’s new national center for industrial biotechnology. “There is an enormous opportunity here,” he says.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">So curing the chemical industry’s <mark>climate change</mark> schizophrenia might enable chemical companies and their users to be future-proof too.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">Shott is not the only chemicals expert advocating a closer working relationship between academia and industry as a way of securing growth and unlocking <mark>sustainable</mark> technologies. The other panelists at the RSC meeting, including David Jakubovic, open <mark>innovation</mark> director for Procter &amp; Gamble, Tony Ryan, chemistry professor and pro-vice chancellor for the University of Sheffield in the U.K., and Andrew Burgess, chief scientist for Akzo Nobel, the company hosting the meeting, also voiced support for bringing academics and industrialists closer together to accelerate <mark>innovation</mark>. Cross-fertilization of technologies across the supply chain could further accelerate <mark>innovation</mark>, the panellists agreed.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">The chemical industry’s <mark>climate change</mark> schizophrenia, as demonstrated by Bock, will go on for some time yet. But the sooner the collective chemistry brains from academia and industry come closer together – as advocated by Shott and others – the sooner chemistry can really be unleashed to tackle <mark>climate change</mark>. Then maybe Bock and other chemical industry leaders can start talking about the ‘holy grail’ chemistries that we are really interested in.</P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The DOE backed the funding of </SPAN><A href=""http://www.bioenergywiki.net/DOE_Selects_Six_Cellulosic_Ethanol_Plants_for_Up_to_$385_Million_in_Federal_Funding""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">six commercial-scale projects for $385M</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> when the biology was barely off the lab bench and no one had drafted engineering plans. Venture capitalists got excited and put too much money into very early stage companies. This is what VCs do – but in this case they expected the companies to scale and commercialize as quickly as software.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">The companies scaled their technology too quickly, skipping important developmental steps. We realized that after investors put $200M into a company, the company then needed an additional $200M to build its first plant. Then, as if high capital costs and scale-up risk were not harmful enough, when the bottom fell out of the energy market during the recession, it took much of the nascent synbio biofuel industry with it. This was followed by new energy sources and tanking oil prices. Competing with $140/barrel oil was one thing, but $50 was impossible.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Then along came the blend wall and the stalling of the </SPAN><A href=""http://www2.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-program""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Renewable Fuels Standard.</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> The problem here was not in biology – it was a systemic failure that no one saw coming soon enough. Many companies went bankrupt and investors closed their doors.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Today, advanced biofuels technology sits mostly with large, deep-pocketed companies. They have had some successes in building large advanced biofuels plants: Abengoa, DuPont, Poet, Beta Renewables, GranBio. Big, patient companies with other revenue streams can hold and improve the technology until such time as we have policies to support <mark>innovation</mark>. Energy markets are not free markets and don’t properly reward or support <mark>innovation</mark>. Advanced biofuel investors need policy made and maintained by a diverse set of governments. We hope to see such policy agreements come </SPAN><A href=""http://unfccc.int/meetings/paris_nov_2015/meeting/8926.php""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">out of Paris this week.</SPAN></A></P><H3>Pivot to Chemicals</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Challenged by cheap oil, investor fatigue, and technical hurdles, many biofuel companies pivoted to produce alternative chemical products through fermentation. We looked for products with lower costs, lower volume, and higher value, that used biomass and bioprocesses to replace petroleum as the important building block in a number of end products including plastics, lubricants, waxes, and cosmetics.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bio-based platform chemicals are now being produced at small scale mostly above the cost of the petroleum-based products they are trying to replace. These chemicals will be at price parity when we get to large-scale production. During product development and certification, products must be tested and approved throughout the supply chain by chemical producers, product manufacturers, brand owners, retailers, and end consumers. Each stakeholder in the supply chain needs to believe the product shows equal to superior performance. Powerful end users like Coca-Cola with their 20% bio-based bottle are a huge help in pulling product through the chain. They are often willing to pay premium price at the start and can adapt their packaging lines. Each new application of a new or drop-in chemical requires testing and approval that takes time and can’t be rushed by impatient investors. </SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many companies like Amyris and Solazyme are developing ingredients that go into other products, such as flavors and fragrances. As in most biochemical production, the microorganism is removed after fermentation, and at a molecular level, the product is identical to the non-fermented product it is made to replace.</SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Three companies (Solazyme, Amyris, BioAmber) have gone public and are having to deal with being in the public markets. For the most part, the companies are moving ahead, producing products and making good partnership announcements. Their share price does not reflect their advances. A sample of the companies moving forward:</SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Solazyme – produces oils for healthier foods; better home, personal care, and industrial products; and more <mark>sustainable</mark> fuels.

Went public through reverse merger with Arpida.</SPAN></LI></UL><P>Many other companies went into bankruptcy or were purchased (Cobalt, LS9, OPX).</P><H3>Next Wave</H3><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">The collision of digital and biotech has given us tools for faster, cheaper, and better product development. We now have a transformative skill set that allows for quick design, not discovery of new products in a predictable fashion. Biology is becoming more software driven using cloud resources, robots, machine learning, and automation. Development can be done in silico. Costs for doing work continue to go down – for example, the costs and time requirement for gene editing are falling rapidly. Zinc-finger nucleases are costly and can take up to a cost about </SPAN><A href=""http://www.biocompare.com/Editorial-Articles/144186-Genome-Editing-with-CRISPRs-TALENs-and-ZFNs/""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">$3,000 per gene and take up to a year. </SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now, using CRISPR/Cas9, the cost is </SPAN><A href=""http://www.biocompare.com/Editorial-Articles/144186-Genome-Editing-with-CRISPRs-TALENs-and-ZFNs/""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">below $500 per gene</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> for a more accurate process that takes only a week. A genome can now be sequenced for well </SPAN><A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-01-15/illuminas-new-low-cost-genome-machine-will-change-health-care-forever""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">under $10,000 and going lower.</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> These new technologies allow product companies to stay smaller longer without burning as much cash.</SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">These tools are opening up new company and product possibilities. Three areas of interest (outside of pharma) are platform technology companies, industrial biotech, and agriculture.</SPAN></P><H3>Platform technologies</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">I got a front row seat to the early stages of a platform technology company as a pre-Series A board member of Zymergen. These fast-emerging companies are developing technology to support and enable product companies. In the previous generation of biofuel/biochemical companies, R&amp;D had to staff their own microbiologists, buy their own robots, and develop their own bioinformatics systems. They had to engineer and optimize their own microorganisms to make desired products.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now product companies can get superior microbes engineered to order. With more than $100M raised among them this year, Zymergen, Ginkgo Bioworks, Synthace, and Biosyntia are relying on a mix of robotic automation, machine learning, novel software, and high-throughput screening to rapidly develop and optimize new strains to produce industrial chemicals and other bio-based products.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tool-based companies have caught the eye of investors this year: </SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Zymergen – brings scale and efficiency to the process of strain optimization. Raised $44M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gingko Bioworks – built organism-engineering foundry to bring new organisms to customers. Raised $54M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Caribou Biosciences – provides solutions for cellular engineering and analysis based on the CRISPR-Cas9. Raised $14.6M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Intrexon – enables products in the health, food, energy, consumer, and environmental industries using platform technology. Primarily in pharma but active in industrial bio and ag. Raised $344M + $160M IPO ($35/share)</SPAN></LI></UL><H3>Industrial Biotechnology</H3><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many startups are focusing on smaller scale, higher value products that do not compete with petroleum or low-margin commodities. These products require less cap-ex and have lower feedstock exposure due to smaller volumes. New products are more likely to help incumbents, not try to replace them. Here are a few examples of these new companies, their products, and money raised to date:</SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bolt Threads – high-performance fashion fibers. Raised $40M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gingko Bioworks  – flavors / fragrances. Raised $54M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Modern Meadow – cultured leather and meat products. Raised $11M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mango Materials – biodegradable plastics from waste biogas</SPAN></LI></UL><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">An area that has gotten much Silicon Valley investor attention is plant- and fermentation-derived meat, eggs, and dairy replacements. Demand for animal protein is increasing in the developing world, devouring resources and creating waste. The total <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of beef is 4 pounds of greenhouse gases </SPAN><A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/one-hamburger-environment-resources-2015-2""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">per quarter pound of meat,</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> including all the greenhouse gases released during its production.  Although taste and consumer acceptance are going to be challenges, animal protein substitutes are a great way to reduce the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. Some companies are developing plant-based products, while others are fermentation-based:</SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Beyond Meat – animal protein from plant protein. Raised $17M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Impossible Foods – meats and cheeses made from plants. Raised  $183M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Clara Foods – synthetic egg whites from fermentation. Raised $1.75M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Muufri – synthetic milk from fermentation. Raised $2.06M</SPAN></LI></UL><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a mentor at </SPAN><A href=""http://www.indiebio.co/""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">IndieBio</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">, an accelerator for synthetic biology startups, I’ve seen a number of exciting new companies. Many startups are focused on the post-animal bio-economy. Groups are developing organisms to make different kinds of meat, egg and milk proteins, shark fin, and gelatin. These companies have a ways to go and their exits are far from certain. But the new products and technologies will have a positive impact on the environment.    </SPAN></P><H3>Agriculture</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’ve worked for decades to commercialize advanced biotechnology tools for the development of genetically modified crops using </SPAN><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Agrobacterium</SPAN></I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> and similar methods. The new focus is on technologies considered non-transgenic in plants, biocontrol products, and plant nutrition to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and toxic inputs, use less land and water, combat pests, and increase soil fertility.</SPAN></P><P><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Feedstock for 2</SPAN></I><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">nd</SPAN></I><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> gen fuels/chemicals and power</SPAN></I></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">As we continue to expand from hydro<mark>carbon</mark>-based products to carbohydrates, we will need better plant sugars using less water, less land, and fewer inputs. As soon as there is a market pull for $20/ton biomass, there will be companies to provide it, likely using new non-GMO tools to produce better crops faster.</SPAN></P><H3>Gene editing, breeding tools</H3><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">The big six ag companies – BASF, Bayer CropScience, Dupont, Dow Chemical Company, Monsanto, and Syngenta – have invested millions of dollars in internal R&amp;D for the commercialization of genetically modified crops. They are unlikely to invest equivalent resources in building new gene editing tools to produce improved non-GMO crops. A number of companies are developing platform technologies to make gene editing faster, quicker, and better. Large seed companies will likely license, partner, and acquire these companies. Two in the forefront are Caribou, with CRISPR technology (raised $14.46M), and Cibus, using gene-editing tools to produce herbicide-resistant crops with other traits and crops on the horizon. To date three US companies are selling crop products that were engineered using gene editing techniques: Cibus – herbicide-resistant canola; Okanagan Specialty Fruits (acquired by Intrexon) – Arctic apples that resist turning brown when sliced or bruised; J. R. Simplot Company – Innate potatoes that resist bruising and produce less potentially</SPAN><A href=""http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">cancer</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">-causing chemical when fried.  Consumer acceptance of the apples and potatoes remains to be seen.</SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regulation of gene editing techniques in crops is still ambiguous, causing some investors to be cautious. The European Commission is debating regulations of the latest techniques, and they may classify plants as GMOs even if they lack foreign DNA. In the United States, modifying plants with </SPAN><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Agrobacterium</SPAN></I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> requires regulation by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, but plants modified by gene editing (ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas based methods) are not currently regulated. In July, the White House launched a multiyear initiative to review federal regulations on agricultural biotechnology so the rules could change. </SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Microbial Solutions: Inoculants, biocontrol, stimulants</SPAN></I></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the beginning of my career, I worked on commercialization of natural biocontrol products produced from sources such as the Neem tree and naturally occurring fungi. We just couldn’t make them financially viable. Now scientists can develop new products to improve crop health by discovering, developing, and altering what naturally occurs in the microbiome of plants and soils. Microbial products are made from microbes that work alone or complement traditional methods of plant production and protection. Products can protect crops from pests and disease, combat resistance, and enhance plant productivity and fertility. Inoculant and biocontrol products can be applied on broad acre crops such as corn and soy, and on fruits and vegetables to help plants take up nutrients and defend against pests, disease, and weeds. </SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Novozymes and Monsanto have formed the BioAg Alliance to catalyze the development of new microbial solutions to address this market. In November, Syngenta and DSM announced a </SPAN><A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-06/syngenta-ties-with-dsm-in-race-for-bacteria-based-crop-products""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">collaboration </SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">that will focus on creating bio-controls, bio-pesticides, and bio-stimulants. A number of smaller companies are developing technologies as well:</SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> AgBiome – researching plant-associated microbiome to discover new biological and trait genes. Raised $34.5M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Symbiota – improve plant health and growth by promoting a healthy microbiome. Raised $7.5M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Agrimetis – natural product-derived compounds to protect crops from weeds, fungal diseases, and insect pests. Raised $7.3M</SPAN></LI></UL><H3>Exits</H3><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">A number of IPOs and acquisitions occurred in the first group of biofuels and biochemical companies with varying degrees of shareholder benefit. I was at Codexis, the first of the group to go public, when we IPOed. Codexis and other early IPO companies have remade themselves a number of times and their value is mostly unrecognized in the public markets. Amyris, Solazyme, Codexis, Gevo, and Metabolix are all trading below $3 a share. REG and Bioamber are trading around $8. Without knowing the financial details, it is unlikely the acquisitions of LS9, OPX, Cobalt, and Verenium were major windfalls for investors. Investment and attitudes will shift for this sector as we develop a price scheme for <mark>carbon</mark> to drive the use of non-petroleum-based products and advanced biofuels.</SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">With all of the seed round and Series A money going into platform, ag, and early-stage biomaterials companies, there is a concern about valuations getting too high and successful routes to exit. Middle-stage capital is missing in this space; medium-size companies have trouble making it to revenues. Raising C or D rounds has been tough. As happens with new asset classes and sectors, most investment firms tracking the industry have yet to build a substantial track record and a route to exit. Private equity firms have played a relatively limited role in the agriculture technology and biomaterials space so far. One of the main reasons is that few of them have been focused on the sector due mostly to the early stage of the companies.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Two examples of acquisitions include Bayer’s $425M acquisition of AgraQuest, the biologicals company, in June 2012 from Otter Capital and Generation Investment Management. In November 2012, BASF acquired Becker Underwood, a biological seed treatment, from Norwest Equity Partners for $1.02B. A few IPOs have occurred in the ag space including Marrone Bio <mark>Innovation</mark>s, the biopesticide company, and Arcadia Biosciences, the agriculture traits producer. Marrone is currently trading 80% below its IPO price and Arcadia is 65% below IPO price. Both deals were downsized on low demand and priced below initial share price target range.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Strategic investors like the Big 6 in ag have played a role in building excitement around the sector and its exit potential. Investors outside the industry – giants like Microsoft and Google – could soon become participants and buyers in ag and biomaterials/products. They will make for interesting competitors for incumbents. </SPAN></P><H3>Going Forward</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">We are in the golden age of biology. With the development of exciting new tools, we can engineer plants and microorganisms to make better, cheaper, and unique products. Many of the solutions I have worked on over my career were not financially viable at the time. We now are able to iterate faster and get to market and revenues more quickly with lower costs. It’s why I never say, “I’ve tried that, it didn’t work.” We just didn’t have the right tools yet. We may never get all segments of the population to say the words “<mark>climate change</mark>,” but society is looking for technologies that make us more resilient and adaptable. This change will help lead us to a price scheme on <mark>carbon</mark>, stimulating investment back into advanced biofuels and chemicals. We will adopt new bio-based materials that reduce the demand for protein sources like beef and eggs for a world with more people and fewer resources. Technologies that allow us to produce more food, fuel, and fiber with fewer inputs will make it to market and create shareholder, consumer, and environmental returns.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">In Paris this week the top global leaders announced the launch of “</SPAN><A href=""http://mission-<mark>innovation</mark>.net/""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mission <mark>Innovation</mark></SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">,” a 20-country initiative to accelerate public and private global clean energy <mark>innovation</mark> to address global <mark>climate change</mark>, provide affordable clean energy to consumers, and create additional commercial opportunities in clean energy.

Munich Re reported that it was the third-costliest year on record behind 2011 and 2005. Many of the most costly events occurred in the United States, including the <mark>devastation</mark> caused by Superstorm Sandy and the widespread, prolonged drought in the Midwest. Companies and their stakeholders—governments, employees, communities and customers—are increasingly concerned about the costs associated with more frequent and intense floods, droughts, hurricanes and wildfires. Many companies are taking steps to begin to enhance their resilience to these growing risks. However, companies traditionally have planned based on past weather events, and few have attempted to integrate the increasing risks associated with the changing <mark>climate</mark> into their planning and operations. Initial efforts to do so suggest that barriers and uncertainties often stand in the way, preventing companies from achieving resilience against the rising risks of <mark>climate change</mark> impacts.</P><P>This report, <EM>Weathering the Storm</EM>, provides an in-depth look at the ways multinational companies are beginning to assess and address the risks of extreme weather and other <mark>climate change</mark> impacts. The companies examined play strategic roles in the global economy in a wide range of sectors including banking and financial services, consumer goods, healthcare, information communications, manufacturing, and materials. The report is based on two complementary lines of research:</P><UL><LI>A comprehensive review of the perspectives and activities of companies listed in the Standard and Poor’s (S&amp;P) Global 100 Index, based on their reporting to the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project and in their corporate sustainability reports and annual financial filings; and</LI><LI>In-depth case studies of the practices and experiences of six companies in diverse sectors: American Water, Bayer, The Hartford Group, National Grid, Rio Tinto and Weyerhaeuser.</LI></UL><P>Together, these sources provide a detailed snapshot of the state of resilience planning among a cross-section of global companies: how they perceive and talk publicly about their <mark>climate</mark>-related risks, the steps they are taking or planning to take, and the barriers that stand in their way. The research in this report also establishes a baseline that can be used to monitor risk management activities related to <mark>climate</mark> impacts over time.</P><P>Broadly speaking, the research reveals that while the vast majority of companies recognize risks from extreme weather and <mark>climate change</mark>, and many see these risks in the present or near term, uncertainty about the precise nature, timing and severity of <mark>climate</mark> impacts often inhibits investment in resilience beyond “business as usual.” A few leading companies are taking steps to address <mark>climate</mark> risks where they see significant opportunities to become more efficient, reduce costs, or provide greater value to customers—in other words, where there is a clear business case to do so. By and large, however, the business response thus far is largely a continuation of existing practices based on a historical picture of past risks, and often fails to adequately consider changing <mark>climate</mark> and weather conditions. Thus, the most common strategy for addressing <mark>climate</mark>-related risks leaves most companies without the resilience they need to weather future physical impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Beyond these broad conclusions, the report outlines a set of more detailed findings on prevailing attitudes and practices among S&amp;P Global 100 companies. And, to help encourage and inform stronger resilience efforts, it lays out a four-step framework for managing <mark>climate</mark> risks that incorporates the emerging best practices from case-study companies already working to prepare for the very likely prospect of increasing extreme weather and <mark>climate change</mark> impacts.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

As per normal, EPA initially invited public suggestions for nominees and then issued a long <A href=""https://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/0/09ED9DB7B1C5BFF18525814B00711533/%24File/SAB%202017%20biosketches%20LOC%20post%2009062017.pdf"">list of nominees</A> (132 individuals) for public comment, before making its final selection of the approximately 50 final members.</P><P>The list of nominees includes <mark>climate</mark>-deniers and many people with financial ties to the regulated chemical industry and that would directly and significantly benefit from lax or failed environmental safeguards.</P><P>We recognize that industry experts often have information of value to the deliberations of the SAB and the policies of EPA, including for example, technical, scientific, and market data. If industry representatives have relevant contributions to the SAB then invitations to address the committee during public meetings are appropriate.</P><P>In <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/resources/nrdc-comments-epa-sab-nominees-2017"">our comments</A> to EPA, we emphasized that the SAB would benefit greatly from members with first-hand knowledge and experience in the way that workplaces and communities experience the issues, policies, and subjects that are the deliberations of the SAB. These include for example workers, union health and safety representatives, industrial hygienists, nurses, community health experts, and social scientists. It also includes tribal representatives, environmental justice representatives, and spokespersons for susceptible populations. Such experts bring a field expertise that is tremendously valuable to ground-truth EPA policies and practices.</P><P>There are some great candidates on EPA’s list—solid scientists that believe in an EPA where the “E” and “P” really matter. EPA doesn’t have to select an industry-biased financially conflicted Science Advisory Board—and it shouldn’t if it plans to follow its own <A href=""https://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/Web/ethics?OpenDocument"">ethics guidelines</A>!

A search on PubMed, the NIH library of over 10 thousand scientific and medical journals, turned up <A href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Belzer+RB+%5Bau%5D"">only three</A> publications with his name in the last fifteen years.</P><P><STRONG>James Bus</STRONG> - Frequent consultant and collaborator with the regulated chemical industry. Employed by Exponent, Inc, whose clients include many regulated chemical manufacturers and users. Exponent has a portion of its practice dedicated to “<A href=""https://www.exponent.com/services/practices/environmental-sciences/chemical-regulation--food-safety/?serviceId=0546eed8-a627-4fed-b360-0de396c65f96&amp;loadAllByPageSize=true&amp;knowledgePageSize=3&amp;knowledgePageNum=0&amp;newseventPageSize=3&amp;newseventPageNum=0"">Chemical Regulation</A> and Food Safety” where it promises its clients, “high-quality, creative, and practical solutions to problems that affect our clients' ability to conduct business globally”, including access to its staff of “technical and regulatory consultants”. The Exponent website says, “<A href=""https://www.exponent.com/services/practices/environmental-sciences/chemical-regulation--food-safety/capabilities/chemical-regulation-and-technical-support/chemical--regulatory-support-services-overview/?serviceId=8a534e4f-b0c7-432d-ae89-e24023bd0ccf&amp;loadAllByPageSize=true&amp;knowledgePageSize=3&amp;knowledgePageNum=0&amp;newseventPageSize=3&amp;newseventPageNum=0"">We assist chemical manufacturers</A>, pesticide registrants, grower/commodity groups, and trade associations in dealing with issues that affect their ability to do business effectively…We specialize in resolving difficult pesticide and non-pesticide issues involving the U.S. EPA...”. All these client services are directly financial impacted by EPA actions and SAB deliberations. That is, weakening or avoiding EPA regulations would directly financially benefit Exponent’s clients; placing Exponent staff on the SAB provides a means for Exponent to deliver on these promises to their industrial clients.</P><P><STRONG>John Graham</STRONG> -  Founding director of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis which was partially <A href=""https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/docs/#id=pznf0128"">supported by tobacco</A>, chemical, pharma and other industries. According to a website that is no longer publicly available, the Center receives <A href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20060306123929/http:/www.hcra.harvard.edu:80/unrestricted.html"">unrestricted grants</A> from 3M, American Chemistry Council, BP America, BASF, Chevron Texaco, Dow Chemical Co, DuPont Agriculture Products, DuPont de Nemours, Electric Power Research Institute, Eastman Chemical Company, ExxonMobil Corporation, FMC Corporation, General Motors, Kraft Foods, Monsanto. Subsequently, as a political appointee under President GW Bush Graham defended the controversial “<A href=""http://www.progressivereform.org/commentary/heinzerling_senior_disc.pdf"">senior discount</A>” in risk assessment, which essentially devalues the benefits of clean air and safe drinking water for older Americans, weakening environmental safeguards. Recently he <A href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/risa.12512/abstract"">defended fracking</A>, writing that, “objective risk assessments suggest that risks are low and controllable through best risk management practices” in a paper funded by his own industry-funded Harvard Center for Risk Analysis.</P><P><STRONG>Michael Honeycutt</STRONG> - The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) under Honeycutt has <A href=""https://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/12/19/16546/one-stop-science-shop-has-become-favorite-industry-and-texas"">downgraded the toxicity</A> of about two-thirds of the 45 chemicals it has evaluated through its risk assessment program since 2007, resulting in weakened environmental safeguards, according to a 2014 investigation by the Center for Public Integrity. In a 2015 report co-authored by Honeycutt titled, “Lowering the Ozone Standard Will Not Measurably Improve Public health,” the authors write, “The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality argues that the thoughtful integration of scientific data does not support the assumption that tightening the <A href=""https://energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Shaw-Lange-and-Honeycutt-EM-2015-Ozone-Health-Benefits.pdf"">ozone standard</A> will result in measurable health benefits.”  Honeycutt has repeatedly made public statements and testified in Congress to <A href=""https://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/hearings/HHRG-112-%20SY20-WState-MHoneycutt-20120606.pdf"">dispute the harmfulness of smog</A> (ground-level ozone) and soot (PM2.5) air <mark>pollution</mark>. His outlier views on these subjects have been rejected repeatedly and emphatically by EPA’s Clean Air Science Advisory Committee, the Scientific Advisory Board and a vast body of medical science.</P><P><STRONG>Jeffrey Lewis</STRONG> - Employed by Exxon Mobil, one of the largest chemical manufacturers in the country, which has a direct financial interest in EPA policies and SAB deliberations. ExxonMobil has had over 160 <A href=""http://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/exxon-mobil"">environmental violations</A> since 2000, resulting in penalties totaling $670 million dollars. In addition to a long <A href=""https://www.corp-research.org/exxonmobil"">rap sheet</A> of environmental regulatory and criminal violations, in 2015 Exxon was shown to have <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken"">intentionally misled</A> investors and the public about the financial risks of <mark>climate change</mark>, while funding <mark>climate</mark>-deniers and fighting <mark>climate</mark>-related legislation despite evidence in their own corporate documents acknowledging the real dangers of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>Kimberly White </STRONG>- Employed by the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the trade organization for the chemical manufacturing companies including ExxonMobil. The ACC and its member companies have a direct and very substantial financial interest weakening or destroying EPA policies and regulations that would safeguard human health and the environment from toxic industrial products and <mark>pollution</mark>.  For example, <A href=""https://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/2dd7f669225439b78525735900400c31/59847b4dd6dced8385257db30001b42e!OpenDocument"">EPA enforcement actions</A> in 2014 targeted Shell and DuPont – both ACC members -  for dangerous air toxics released during industrial flaring at their refineries and chemical plants; this was noted to be particularly harmful to the health of minority and low-income communities living nearby. ACC member company <A href=""https://www.americanchemistry.com/Membership/MemberCompanies/"">Arkema Inc</A> recently made national news after it had explosions and toxic chemical spills associated with the flooding from Hurricane Harvey in Texas, initiating an <A href=""http://www.csb.gov/arkema-inc-chemical-plant-fire-/"">investigation</A> by the Chemical Safety Board. Weakening EPA rules and regulations would bring an immediate and substantial financial benefit to these chemical companies and other ACC members.</P><P>In addition to the above chemical industry employees and consultants, a dozen of the candidates are <mark>climate</mark> science deniers.</P><P><STRONG>As <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/2017/09/14/stories/1060060647"">reported in E&amp;E</A>, by News Reporter Scott Waldman (Sept 14, 2017), the following anti-science <mark>climate</mark>-deniers are also on EPA list of nominees being considered:</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Joseph D'Aleo</STRONG> runs <mark>climate</mark> skeptic websites and has appeared as a speaker at Heartland conferences. D'Aleo said his priority on the board would be attacking the endangerment finding, the legally binding document that holds that <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and other greenhouse gases harm human health and must be regulated by the executive branch. He said he wants to challenge the finding because it could otherwise be used later to build back Obama-era environmental regulations. &quot;We're going to push for reconsideration, start from scratch and put together the best science,&quot; he said. &quot;If <mark>CO2</mark> is not a serious pollutant, let's focus the attention of the EPA on other issues.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Edwin Berry</STRONG> funded his own <mark>climate</mark> research and says human <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions do not cause <mark>climate change</mark>. He has compared those who believe in human-caused <mark>climate change</mark> to &quot;Aztecs who believed they could make rain by cutting out beating hearts and rolling decapitated heads down temple steps.&quot; On his Twitter account, he has called Islam &quot;a death cult&quot; and has encouraged motorists to drive into protesters. Berry, in an email to E&amp;E News, described his tweet as a joke and said he does not advocate violence…. Berry, who confirmed that he and a number of other skeptics were nominated by Heartland, said he wants to use his position on the board to show that humans barely contribute to atmospheric <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels, which he claimed are mostly driven by natural factors. &quot;Let's get over this whole thing about <mark>climate change</mark> being an important thing, because in fact we humans have a negligible impact on <mark>climate</mark>,&quot; he said.</P><P><STRONG>Alan Carlin</STRONG>, a retired EPA employee who is affiliated with Heartland fought the agency's crafting of the endangerment finding. Carlin, an economist, was at the center of a political firestorm under Obama after he produced a widely criticized 93-page report comprising cherry-picked scientific data and blog entries concluding that regulating <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide was &quot;the worst mistake that EPA has ever made.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Kevin Dayaratna</STRONG>, a statistician at the conservative Heritage Foundation: His report was cited by Trump as a reason to withdraw from the Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord. It claimed that the agreement could shrink U.S. gross domestic product by $2.5 trillion within two decades (though Trump stated the impact as coming within a decade). The report was criticized by some as being misleading, because that amount is less than 1 percent of the aggregate GDP over that period and the report did not account for the cost of taking no <mark>climate change</mark> action. Dayaratna was invited to attend Trump's withdrawal announcement in June in the White House Rose Garden.</P><P><STRONG>Paul Driessen</STRONG>, a senior policy adviser at the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, a libertarian environmental think tank: His organization handed out leaflets at a <mark>climate</mark> protest this year in Washington, D.C., that said, &quot;<mark>CO2</mark> is not the 'control knob' of the <mark>climate</mark>.&quot; He also co-founded <mark>Climate</mark> Exit, or &quot;Clexit,&quot; which criticized the science behind the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement and holds that spiking levels of atmospheric <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide benefit the Earth. &quot;The world must abandon this suicidal Global Warming crusade,&quot; the group stated in its founding statement. &quot;Man does not and cannot control the <mark>climate</mark>.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Gordon Fulks</STRONG>, a physicist and adviser to the Cascade Policy Institute, an Oregon-based libertarian think tank: He has denied that net sea ice melt is occurring and that the Earth is warming. He has said those who express concern about <mark>climate change</mark> are like a &quot;societal pathogen that virulently spreads misinformation in tiny packages like a virus.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>David Legates</STRONG>, a professor of climatology at the University of Delaware: He has denied that human-caused <mark>climate change</mark> could have catastrophic consequences and has co-authored <mark>climate</mark> research claiming polar bears are not harmed by human-caused <mark>climate change</mark> that was quietly funded, at least in part, by Koch Industries Inc.”</P><P><STRONG>See our <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/resources/nrdc-comments-epa-sab-nominees-2017"">full comments</A> to EPA for details and references</STRONG>.</P><DIV class=""media media-element-container media-full_content""><FIGURE id=""file-16444"" class=""image-full-width file file-inline-image file-image-jpeg no-attribution has-caption""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""figcaption-element figcaption-caption"">

(1989) (Table 6), which was used for derivation of the Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) (see Characterization of Ecological Risk section), is included in Appendix I.</P><P>The ecotoxicity of ethanedial (hydrated monomer) was also modelled using ECOSAR (2008) and CPOPs (2008), and found to be very low. Ethanedial was modelled as a neutral organic by ECOSAR, and as a “base surface narcotic” by the OASIS sub-model in CPOPs. ECOSAR acute and chronic effect values ranged from 358 mg/L (for 14-day earthworm LC<SUB>50</SUB>) to greater than 100 000 mg/L. The highest values were predicted for salt-water organisms. OASIS-CPOPs acute predictions for daphnid and fathead minnow were LC<SUB>50</SUB>s of 77 000 and 63 000 mg/L, respectively. The modelled toxicity predictions show that ethandial (hydrated monomer) has low toxicity to aquatic organisms, which is in agreement with the empirical data.</P><H3>Ecological Exposure Assessment</H3><P>No data concerning concentrations of this substance in water in Canada have been identified; therefore, environmental concentrations are estimated from available information, including substance import, usage and release quantities submitted under S.71 of CEPA (Environment Canada 2010a), and size of receiving water bodies.</P><P>Some international data on concentrations of ethanedial in the environment are available. Ethanedial has been detected in surface and groundwater samples in the U.S. and Europe at low (£ 12 µg/L) levels (CICAD 2004). It has also been found in ozone-treated drinking water samples at a median concentration of 9 µg/L (IPCS 2000). More information on levels of ethanedial in the environment is available in the CICAD (2004) report.</P><H3>A – Industrial Release</H3><H4>Aquatic Environment</H4><P>Since a significant proportion of ethanedial is released to water (see previous section on Releases to the Environment), realistic but conservative (i.e. protective of the environment) scenarios were used to estimate concentrations of ethanedial resulting from industrial discharge. In these scenarios, ethanedial is released from industrial use to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) which discharges its effluent to a receiving water body. The concentration of the substance in the receiving water near the discharge point of the wastewater treatment plant is used as the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) in evaluating the aquatic risk of the substance. The PEC was calculated using the equations:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>C<SUB>water-ind</SUB> = [1000 × Q × L × (1 - R)] / [N × F × D] [1]</P><P><EM>PEC = C<SUB>water-ind</SUB> + B</EM> [2]</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P>C<SUB>water-ind</SUB>: aquatic concentration resulting from industrial releases, mg/LQ: total substance quantity used annually at an industrial site, kg/yrL: loss to wastewater, fractionR: wastewater treatment plant removal rate, fractionN: number of annual release days, d/yrF: wastewater treatment plant effluent flow, m<SUP>3</SUP>/dD: receiving water dilution factor, dimensionlessPEC: predicted environmental concentration (from both industrial releases and natural sources), mg/LB: natural background concentration, mg/L</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Exposure analyses were conducted for the aquatic compartment for the top six industrial users and/or importers of ethanedial in 2006, identified from respondents to the CEPA Section 71 Survey (Environment Canada 2010a). A combination of site-specific and generic exposure assumptions were used in the exposure analyses, to yield reasonable worst-case scenarios, as described below. Each user/importer reported an annual total use and/or import quantity of ethanedial in the range of 10 000 to 100 000 kg. These exposure analyses are therefore expected to represent realistic worst case release scenarios across Canada based on a general assumption that the quantity released is proportional to the quantity used, as per equation 1 above.</P><P>Dilution factors of 10 were applied for the concentrations in the receiving water, as all the sites discharged to large water bodies. A conservative WWTP effluent flow at the 10<SUP>th</SUP>percentile (3 456 m<SUP>3</SUP>/d) of the WWTP discharge rates across Canada was used in the calculations. The scenarios assumed that the releases occur 250 days per year, typical for small and medium-sized facilities (a conservative assumption). The fraction lost to wastewater was based on either loss estimates reported by the company involved (Environment Canada 2010a) or a default loss estimate of 5% of the total quantity used by the company, whichever was greater. The generic loss estimate of 5% is based on conservative estimates for losses from container handling and cleaning (3%) (PEI 1988), transfer pipelines (1%) and process vessels (1%) (US EPA 1992). To take into account background concentrations of ethanedial naturally present in the water, a concentration of 0.01 mg/L was included in each PEC. This background concentration is very conservative, considering that ethanedial has been found in natural waters at concentrations of £ 12 µg/L (CICAD 2004).</P><P>WWTP removal rates after primary and secondary treatment of 90.2 %, 99.7 % and 96.0 % were predicted using the models SimpleTreat (1997), STP (2001) and ASTreat (2006), respectively (Environment Canada 2010c). These high predicted WWTP removal rates are due to the high rate of biodegradation that is predicted to occur during the secondary treatment phase. The predicted environmental concentration (PEC) calculation used the most conservative WWTP removal rate of 90.2 %, as modelled by SimpleTreat (1997), for those facilities with secondary treatment, assuming no removal (e.g., by degradation) in the receiving surface water. For facilities with only primary treatment, 0% removal by the WWTP was assumed.</P><P>Based on the above assumptions, the PECs were estimated to be in the range of 0.036 mg/L to 0.89 mg/L for the top 6 industrial users of ethanedial in Canada. The PEC values obtained are considered to represent the level of exposure under realistic worst case release scenarios in the receiving water near the point of the discharge from wastewater treatment plants.</P><H4>Terrestrial Environment</H4><P>Several companies reported releases of ethanedial to soil, including one paper products manufacturer, and two companies using ethanedial as part of a water-based drilling muds or fluids used for oil and gas exploration, at concentrations of 0.4 – 0.9% (Environment Canada 2010a). The releases to soil reported by the paper products manufacturers are relatively small (approximately 1% of their total usage of ethanedial) (Environment Canada 2010a).</P><P>One of the companies involved in oil and gas exploration reported that all waste from water-based drilling muds is disposed of using an Energy Resources Conservation Board approved borrow pit, “which is monitored and remediated to ensure sound environmental performance (Environment Canada 2010a)”. The other company involved in oil and gas exploration reported that their discharges of ethanedial in the drilling fluids to land (which totalled approximately 2000 kg in 2006) follow the regulations for discharge of drilling fluids: “For land discharges, the drilling fluid system is tested with [a toxicity testing system using the bioluminescent marine bacterium (<EM>Vibrio fischeri</EM>) as the test organism]. If the drilling fluid passes [this bioassay], then it is land farmed. If it fails then it is sent to an offsite waste management facility. The products that have [ethanedial] would pass [the bioassay] themselves but other products in the drilling fluid system cause the drilling fluid to fail (Environment Canada 2010a).”</P><H3>B – Consumer Release</H3><P>Even though ethanedial is found in personal care products and in paints and coatings, it is expected to be found in only very small concentrations in these products, as a residual from polymerising reactions in the finished products (CNS 2010, Environment Canada 2010a). Ethanedial is also used in small concentrations (0.04-4%) in liquid disinfectants used for cleaning medical instruments such as in hospital facilities (DPD 2010). A total quantity of less than 1000 kg ethanedial was reported to be imported or used in disinfectants and other consumer products in Canada in 2006 (Environment Canada 2010a).</P><P>Quantities of ethanedial used in consumer applications are several orders of magnitude smaller than the amount used in industrial applications (Environment Canada 2010a). Therefore, since more dispersive releases from consumer use are expected to result in environmental exposure concentrations much smaller than those resulting from industrial applications, a PEC was not estimated for consumer releases.</P><H3>Characterization of Ecological Risk</H3><P>The approach taken in this assessment was to examine the available scientific information and develop conclusions based on a weight-of-evidence approach and using precaution as required under CEPA 1999. Lines of evidence considered include results from conservative risk quotient calculations, as well as information on the persistence, bioaccumulation, toxicity, sources and fate of the substance.</P><P>Ethanedial is expected to degrade relatively quickly in all environmental compartments and have low bioaccumulation potential. It also has relatively low ecotoxicity.</P><P>A conservative predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for the aquatic compartment was derived from the lowest aquatic toxicity value identified – the EC<SUB>50</SUB> for algae (<EM>Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata</EM>) of 149 mg/L (Table 6). This value was selected as the critical toxicity value, and divided by an assessment factor of 10 to account for uncertainties related to interspecies and intraspecies variability in sensitivity, and extrapolation from a laboratory EC<SUB>50</SUB> to a no-effect value in the field. This calculation resulted in a PNEC of 14.9 mg/L.</P><P>Risk quotients (PEC/PNEC) were calculated, based on the above-described PEC values for the top 6 industrial users/importers of ethanedial in Canada, and the PNEC of 14.9 mg/L. The risk quotients for the 6 sites ranged from 0.002 to 0.06. These conservative risk quotients for the aquatic compartment from the industrial scenarios described above indicate that exposure values are unlikely to be high enough to cause harm to aquatic organisms.</P><P>Since the majority of releases of this substance are likely to water at industrial manufacturing sites, and results of fugacity modeling indicate that virtually all of the substance discharged to water will remain in water, significant exposure of organisms at other types of locations or in media other than water are unlikely. In soil, ethanedial is not expected to persist (see Persistence Section), and given its low toxicity to soil bacteria and the one species of terrestrial plant tested, the above-described industrial releases of ethanedial to soil are not considered to be of concern.</P><P>Based on the above, ethanedial is thus unlikely to be causing ecological harm in Canada.</P><H3>Uncertainties in Evaluation of Ecological Risk</H3><P>It should be noted that this conclusion was reached despite the conservative assumptions that were made in response to uncertainties encountered in the assessment. A key uncertainty relates to the lack of empirical data on environmental concentrations in Canada, which was addressed by using conservative assumptions in the industrial exposure scenarios. There is also some uncertainty associated with the PNEC used in the risk quotient calculation, due to the paucity of chronic ecotoxicity data for this substance.</P><P>Given the use of this substance in other countries, it is possible that ethanedial is entering the Canadian market as a component of consumer products. Available information is currently not sufficient to derive a quantitative estimate that would help determine the importance of this source. Releases to sewer could be larger than the amount estimated here, due to widely dispersed releases from the imported consumer products.</P><H2>Potential to Cause Harm to Human Health</H2><H3>Exposure Assessment</H3><P><STRONG>Environmental Media and Food</STRONG></P><P>Only limited empirical data were identified for levels of ethanedial in environmental media.</P><P>Ambient air monitoring data for ethanedial is available, particularly for areas around large urban centers in North America and for the arctic (Liu 2006, Kawamura 1996, 2001, Weisel 2005). Studies from both Canada and the United States show detectable levels of ethanedial in ambient air ranging between 0.00054 – 2.29 µg/m<SUP>3</SUP> (Liu 2006, Kawamura 1996, 2001). Canadian data from a monitoring site in Simcoe, Ontario, gathered in 1999-2000, were used to estimate the intake from ambient air. The mean concentration for ethanedial was 1.06 µg/m<SUP>3</SUP>(Aiello 2009). Other studies from the United States show similar concentrations with mean concentrations ranging from 0.49 – 1.81 µg/m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P><P>Fewer studies were identified for indoor air monitoring; with no data available from Canada. Indoor air monitoring data was collected in two studies from the United States, comparing over 500 samples from three cities: Los Angeles, Houston and Elizabeth, NJ (Liu 2006, Weisel 2005). The mean concentrations during the sampling years 1999 – 2003 for ethanedial in each study were 0.87 µg/m<SUP>3</SUP> (Weisel 2005) and 2.53 µg/m<SUP>3</SUP> (Liu 2006). In the absence of Canadian indoor air data and given that there is a higher concentration of ethanedial in ambient air in the Simcoe Ontario study, 1.06 µg/m<SUP>3</SUP> was used as a surrogate for indoor air in estimating the environmental exposure.</P><P>For both soil and drinking water, no monitoring data was available in Canada or elsewhere. As a conservative approach, environmental concentrations for these media were estimated using ChemCAN, a Canada-specific environmental exposure model. Using submissions from section 71 reporting release amounts of ethanedial to the environment, predicted concentrations for water and soil were low to negligible – 8.17×10<SUP>-3</SUP> µg/L and 1.19×10<SUP>-3</SUP> µg/kg (Canada 2009b, ChemCAN 2003).</P><P>There is limited information on the concentration of ethanedial in the smoke of tobacco products available in Canada. However, Fujioka and Shibamoto (2005) detected ethanedial in tobacco smoke at concentrations of 1.93 to 6.98 µg per cigarette.</P><P>In a similar US study, the level of ethanedial in mainstream cigarette smoke from regular size cigarettes ranged from 1.93 to 4.78 µg per cigarette (Kazutoshi and Takayuki 2005).</P><P>There is limited information on the conetration of ethanedial in food. Heat processing reactions such as caramelization, roasting, frying or baking and the Maillard reaction of saccharides with proteins involving glucose contribute to the formation of ethanedial in various foods (Arribas-Lorenzo 2010, CICAD 2004). Studies have found low concentrations of the substance in food and beverages that have been fermented, baked or browned (SCCP 2005). Recent studies from Europe and Japan show the presence of ethanedial in various food products (Arribas-Lorenzo 2010, Weigel 2004, Barros 1999, Yamaguchi 1994). Naturally produced honey was found to contain 0.2–2.7 mg of ethanedial/kg of product (median: 1.7 mg/kg) (Weigel 2004). In a study of yogurt from Japan, ethanedial was detected at a concentration of 0.92 µg/kg (Yamaguchi 1994). In addition, fermented beverages, such as wine and beer, have been shown to contain concentrations of ethanedial ranging from 0.025 to 0.041 mg/L in beer and 0.36 to 1.5 mg/L in wine (Barros 1999, Yamaguchi 1994). The limited available data was used to estimate potential intake from food and beverages. While ethanedial is present in some fermented food products, fermented beverages are not commonly consumed by children under the age of 11. Therefore, beer and wine were removed from the intake estimate for this subpopulation.</P><P>The upper bounding estimate of daily intake for ethanedial from environmental media and food ranged from 0.3 µg/kg-bw per day (0–0.5 years old; breast-fed and formula fed) to 84 µg/kg-bw per day (0–0.5 years old; not formula fed).</P><P><STRONG>Consumer Products</STRONG></P><P>Ethanedial is used as an intermediate in the production of a number of compounds including resins and polymers, which have broad applications including paint coatings and primers, adhesives, paper resins and paper coatings.These uses may result in limited general population exposure to residual levels of ethanedial in certain consumer products (e.g., paint coatings and primers, paper). Upper-bounding estimates of exposure were derived for the following consumer product scenarios: inhalation and dermal exposure for individuals using water-based latex architectural paint and incidental mouthing of paper by young children.</P><P>Ethanedial is present as a production residual in cellulosic thickeners used for paint coatings and primers at concentration levels up to 0.5%. (Environment Canada 2010a, April 2010 email from Canadian Paint and Coating Association, to Risk Management Bureau, Health Canada; unreferenced). However, the concentration for ethanedial is lower in waterborne paint products due to dilution. Based on literature regarding the use of thickeners in paints, the total amount of thickener used would be between 0.4 and 1.8% by weight (June 2010 email from Canadian Paint and Coating Association, to Risk Management Bureau, Health Canada; unreferenced). This gives a conservative estimate of ethanedial upper-bounding concentration at 0.009% by weight in paint products. Ethanedial was not reported to be present in either industrial or automotive paint products. A conservative approach assumes that an individual’s use of water-based architectural paint and primer containing 0.009% ethanedial is used once a year. The following scenario using the US EPA’s Wall Paint Exposure Model was used to estimate the inhalation exposure. By priming and painting the walls of an enclosed room with a volume of 22 m<SUP>3</SUP> and an air flow rate of 0.45 air changes per hour, an acute inhalation exposure of 1.1 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> mg/kg-bw per event was determined assuming 20 hours of exposure to the air in the room (see Appendix III). This value is considered conservative based on the upper-bounding concentration of ethanedial used. As the function of ethanedial is to cross-link starches used in the thickeners, the compound is unlikely to be airborne. Furthermore, its low vapour pressure of 2.6 Pa (2.52 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> atm) indicates limited volatility.</P><P>A dermal exposure estimate to ethanedial for painters was derived using ConsExpo. The scenario was based on exposure of arms and hands to paint; painting of a surface area of 0.33 m<SUP>2</SUP>, at a rate of 30 mg/min over 120 min, results in an estimate of acute exposure of 4.6 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> mg/kg-bw per event.</P><P>Submissions pertaining to the presence of ethanedial in paper products or paper coatings from several companies identified minimal levels (Environment Canada 2010a). Similarly, companies in Australia report low concentrations of ethanedial in paper products (NICNAS 2004). The solvent form of ethanedial is used as an intermediate for paper and textile auxiliaries. In paper strength resins, ethanedial is polymerized with polyacrylamides allowing for an effective bonding with cellulose fibres (2010 personal communication from Forestry, Agriculture, Aquaculture Division, Environment Canada; unreferenced). As this is a wet treatment, it would be expected that a significant portion of free ethanedial would migrate to the wastewater stream. In the process of paper coatings, ethanedial is one of many paper coating additives, generally accounting for no more than 1% of the coating formulation. There may be little migration of ethanedial from the finished paper product due to the chemical binding of the additives and due to the desirable properties of the product containing ethanedial.</P><P>Incidental oral exposure to ethanedial could occur via mouthing of paper by young children. Such incidental exposure is more likely for children 0.5 – 4 years of age than for infants (0 – 6 months old). In a highly conservative approach for children aged 6 months to 4 years, oral exposure to ethanedial is estimated to be 0.24 mg/kg-bw per event assuming that ¼ of an 8.5 × 11” sheet of paper containing 0.37% w/w ethanedial is fully consumed, and all of the cross-linked ethanedial unlinks, solubilises and becomes bioavailable. This exposure estimate is considered very conservative as it is unlikely that all steps mentioned above will take place in reality for ethanedial to become bioavailable.</P><P>Dermal exposure to ethanedial in paper is expected to be negligible for the general population.</P><P>Ethanedial may be detected as a residual from polymerization reactions in some cosmetic and personal care products; and is an intentional ingredient in a small number of cosmetic and personal care products used by the general population. According to Health Canada’s CNS database, ethanedial is present at concentrations up to 0.1% in products such as skin cleanser, body and face moisturizer, hair dye, and shaving preparation. It is also present in hair conditioner up to 3% w/w and manicure preparation up to 1% w/w (CNS 2010). These may result in limited exposure to the general population. According to the European Union Health and Consumer Protection Directorate, maximum residuals levels of ethanedial in cosmetics may reach 100 ppm (SCCP 2005).</P><P>Ethanedial is also a nonmedicinal ingredient in one currently licensed natural health product, an acne facial cleanser at concentration of 0.001% w/w (LNHPD 2010). An acne face cleansing product sold in Canada with residual concentrations of 0.001% by weight (10 ppm) is used to estimate dermal exposure (April 2010 email from Natural Health Products Directorate, Health Canada, to Risk Management Bureau, Health Canada). Potential exposure to the facial area of an adult from daily use of acne face wash was estimated using ConsExpo, resulting in a chronic exposure of 7.05 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> mg/kg-bw per day (ConsExpo 2006) (see Appendix III).</P><P>The exposure estimates from use of cosmetics and personal care products were modelled based on the upper-bounding concentration reported by the CNS database (see Appendix III). The resulting daily dermal exposure estimates ranged from 3.6 mg/kg-bw per day (shaving preparation) to 0.23 mg/kg-bw per day (body lotion) for frequently used products, while the acute dermal exposure estimates for two products which are less frequently used were 7.1 mg/kg-bw per event for manicure preparation product and 0.14 mg/kg-bw per event for hair dyes. The derived dermal exposure estimates are considered overestimates as they were based on the reported maximum concentration from CNS (CNS, 2010) Given that ethanedial is a residual in the ingredients used in cosmetic and personal care products, and that 0.1% is the maximum concentration in the lowest reportable range in the CNS where most of the products were notified in, the actual concentration level is expected to be much lower than 0.1%. This is further supported by the orders of magnitude difference in skin cleanser reported in both CNS (&lt;0.1% w/w) and LNHPD (0.001% w/w). The concentration of ethanedial in manicure preparation would also be considered lower than what was reported by the CNS. Given that it is intended to cross-link nail protein, ethanedial is unlikely to be airborne or absorbed.</P><P>Inhalation exposure may also occur during use of manicure preparation products and Spray-on leave-in hair conditioner; however, the exposure to ethanedial during use of these products was estimated to be low (refer to Appendix III).</P><P>Ethanedial is present as an ingredient in pesticide and disinfectant products. Ethanedial is a formulant in pesticides. Pesticidal and disinfectant uses are limited to occupational settings. Therefore, exposure estimates were not derived for these products.</P><H3>Uncertainty in Exposure Assessment</H3><P>Confidence in the environmental media database is considered low due to lack of information. The Canadian ambient air data is considered acceptable for estimating air exposure to ethanedial. Despite the availability of indoor data from the United States, the Canadian outdoor air data was used, resulting in a more conservative estimate of exposure. In the absence of soil and water data, ChemCAN modelling was used to estimate Exposure, thereby increasing conservatism and uncertainty in the upper-bounding intake estimate.</P><P>Despite the lack of data on levels of ethanedial in food in Canada and the limited data available for food products containing ethanedial elsewhere, it was considered appropriate to assess the potential for Canadians to be exposed to ethanedial in foods using the available data. The resulting dietary intake estimate may overestimate exposure and is not considered representative of the Canadian situation.</P><P>Confidence in the estimates of exposure to products available for consumer use is considered moderate. There is little uncertainty in the concentrations of ethanedial found in consumer products; however, uncertainty exists due to conservative inputs in the exposure models, particularly those consumer products reporting a range &lt;0.1% from CNS and in the paper mouthing scenario where it is assumed that all of the crosslinked ethanedial is bioavailable and absorbed.</P><H3>Health Effects Assessment</H3><P>A summary of the available toxicological information for ethanedial (glyoxal) is presented in Appendix IV.</P><P>The European Commission (EU) has classified ethanedial as a category 3 mutagen (<EM>causes concern for humans owing to possible mutagenic effects</EM>) based on predominantly positive results for mutagenicity in <EM>in vitro</EM> and equivocal results in <EM>in vivo</EM> assays (EU 1996). The results of <EM>in vitro</EM> assays of genotoxicity are relatively consistent. In bacteria, ethanedial induced reverse mutations in multiple <EM>Salmonella</EM> strains in the Ames’ assay, and in various strains of <EM>E. coli</EM>(WP2uvrA, pKM101) with and without metabolic activation depending on strain (summarised in OECD 2003). Ethanedial was also positive in multiple bacterial assays for DNA damage including the SOS<EM>umu</EM>, SOS chromo, and <EM>rec</EM> assays (Von der Hude et al. 1988; Matsui et al., 1989; Ono et al. 1991a,b). However, ethanedial was negative in host-mediated assays (mouse, intravenous exposure) for bacterial DNA damage (Hellmer &amp; Bolcsfoldi 1992b).</P><P>Ethanedial exposure produced predominantly positive results in<EM>in vitro</EM> mutagenicity assays in mammalian cell lines. Positive results were obtained in the mouse lymphoma L5178TK<SUP>+/-</SUP> forward mutation assay without activation, and in COS-7 cells carrying the pMY189 plasmid, which was treated with glyoxal prior to its introduction into the cells (Wangenheim &amp; Bolcsfoldi 1988; Murata-Kamiya 1997b). Reversion of CHO AUXB1/GAT cells to adenosine-thymidine-glycine prototrophy was also observed <EM>in vitro</EM> (Taylor &amp; Wu 1980; Taylor et al. 1984). However, ethanedial did not induce forward mutations at the HPRT locus in CHO-S/HPRT or V79/HGPRT cells (Taylor et al. 1983; Societe Francaise Hoechst 1986a). Chromosomal aberrations were observed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in V79 cells with and without metabolic activation (Henkel 1986; Nishi et al. 1989). CHO AUXB1, CHO (normal), and human lymphocytes were all positive for sister chromatid exchange after exposure to ethanedial (American Cyanamid Co. 1982; Tucker et al. 1989). Furthermore,<EM>in vitro</EM> investigations of DNA damage indicated that ethanedial exposure increased instances of unscheduled DNA synthesis and single-strand breaks in Syrian hamster TC-SV40 cells and mouse lymphoma L5178TK<SUP>+/-­</SUP>cells, respectively (Cornago et al. 1989; Garberg et al. 1988; Wangenheim &amp; Bolcsfoldi 1988). Ethanedial did not induce DNA cross-links in rat hepatocytes in the presence of a metabolic activation system (Ueno et al. 1991b), but did cause increased DNA damage in TK6 human lymphoblastoid cells exposed to ethanedial (Henderson et al. 1998). At higher doses, DNA damage was also detected in rat hepatocytes by comet assay (Kuchenmeister et al. 1998). Interestingly, a dose-dependent decrease in the tail moment, and an increase in highly condensed, circular DNA spots were observed as dose increased. Of 100 compounds tested by this method, this type of damage appeared to be specific for certain aldehydes (WHO 2004). The authors suggested that the cross-linking ability of glyoxal may have prevented DNA from migrating through the gel at higher doses (Kuchenmeister et al. 1998); however, no data was provided to support this conjecture. Furthermore, human umbilical vein endothelial cells incubated in the presence of 100 µg ethanedial /ml had significantly increased numbers of formamidopyrimidine<EM>N</EM>-glycosylase (FPG)-sensitive sites without a concomitant increase in intracellular hydroperoxides (Shimoi et al. 2001). FPG is known to repair oxidative DNA damage and abasic sites as well as repair guanine-glyoxal adducts (WHO 2001), thus suggesting that ethanedial reacts directly with DNA intracellularly. In an earlier report, cell transformation was not observed when mouse embryonic cells were exposed to ethanedial (Mason 1980a, b, c) (see Appendix IV for details).</P><P>The genotoxicity of ethanedial has also been investigated <EM>in vivo</EM>. Swiss mice exposed orally to ethanedial did not have an increased incidence of micronuclei in the bone marrow at time-points up to 72 h (Societe Francaise 1986b). In an older, insufficiently documented study, subcutaneous injections of ethanedial caused chromosome aberrations in the duodenum, testes, and spleen in rats. No increase in the incidence of chromosomal aberrations was observed in the liver or pancreas (Thomas 1958). Unscheduled DNA synthesis was observed in the pyloric mucosa, but not in primary rat hepatocytes of rats exposed by gavage to ethanedial (Furihata et al. 1985; CCR 1992). Additionally, exposure by gavage, resulting in high localized concentrations, caused dose dependent increases in the number of DNA strand breaks observed in the pyloric mucosa and livers of exposed rats (Furihata &amp; Matsushima 1989; Ueno et al. 1991b). Ethanedial was negative in the sex-linked recessive lethal mutation test, the dominant lethal test, and for reciprocal translocations in <EM>Drosophila melanogaster</EM> (Barnett &amp; Munoz 1989).</P><P>The mechanism of ethanedial induced mutagenicity <EM>in vitro</EM> is not completely understood. Ethanedial has been shown to form a cyclic ethanedial dG-adduct when incubated with purified DNA under physiological conditions, <EM>in vitro</EM>. The investigators also detected GC and GA cross-links in glyoxal treated DNA (Kasai et al. 1998). Other studies have confirmed that ethanedial can form stable adducts with DNA <EM>in vitro</EM>(summarised in OECD 2003). However, Ueno et al (1991) demonstrated, in <EM>Salmonella typhimurium</EM>, that the observed mutagenicity is not necessarily due to direct interaction of glyoxal with DNA. Rather, the generation of free radicals was determined to be the cause of the observed mutagenicity, with the singlet oxygen species being the most important. Treatment of the bacteria with chemicals that scavenge singlet oxygen almost completely suppressed mutagenesis induced by glyoxal treatment (Ueno et al. 1991c). Therefore, it is unclear whether the genotoxicity of glyoxal, observed in some <EM>in vivo</EM> studies, is due to penetration of ethanedial across the cell membrane and the nuclear envelope and direct interaction with the DNA or by triggering the formation of DNA-damaging free radicals such as singlet oxygen.</P><P>Ethanedial has not been classified by other international agencies or regulatory bodies as to its carcinogenicity. No chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity data is available with respect to the oral or inhalation exposure routes. The effects of chronic dermal exposure were investigated in a lifelong bioassay in mice. Groups of mice were exposed topically to one of two commercial preparations of ethanedial for a total exposure of 23 mg/kg-bw/day<SUP><STRONG>[<A href=""#footnote3"">3</A>]</STRONG></SUP> for life. Control mice were treated with deionised water. Ethanedial did not induce tumours on the skin of any mice. One male receiving European ethanedial 40 developed a fibrosarcoma, which was not considered related to treatment as historical data indicated that these often occur spontaneously in males of this strain (Bushy Run 1982).</P><P>Ethanedial has been tested in both tumour-initiating and -promoting assays. CD-1 mice exposed topically to approximately 485 mg ethanedial/kg-bw/day (1698 mg/kg-bw administered twice weekly) for 5 weeks, followed by 47 weeks of dermal exposure to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (promoter), did not have increased incidences of skin tumours when compared to controls (Miyakawa et al. 1991). Wistar rats exposed via drinking water to<EM>N</EM>-methyl-<EM>N</EM>’-nitro-<EM>N</EM>-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) for 8 weeks, followed by 32 weeks of exposure to approximately 907 mg ethanedial/kg-bw/day, had significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased incidences of adenocarcinomas and hyperplasias of the stomach when compared to those that did not receive ethanedial (Takahashi et al. 1989) demonstrating a tumor-promoting potential <EM>in vivo</EM>.</P><P>No developmental studies via the dermal or inhalation route were identified. In contrast, oral dosing developmental studies conducted by the United States National Toxicology Program (NTP) were identified. In a range-finding study, SD rats were exposed orally, by gavage, from GD 6-15, to ethanedial trimeric dihydrate (the predominant form in solution), which converted to 166 to 1657 mg/kg-bw/day ethanedial. Maternal toxicity was evidenced by decreased weight gain at the 166 mg/kg-bw/day level and above. At exposures greater than 663 mg/kg-bw/day, clinical signs of toxicity and decreased gravid uterine weight were observed. Maternal deaths occurred at 994 mg/kg-bw/day and above (NTP 1991c). The follow up to the range-finding study exposed SD rats orally to 41, 124, 249 mg/kg-bw/day ethanedial (converted from ethanedial trimeric dihydrate) from GD 6-15. No maternal toxicity or embryotoxic effects were observed at any level in this study. A more recent investigation was conducted using 19-24 female Wistar rats per group. The rats were exposed by gavage to 0, 5, 25, or 125 mg/kg-bw/day ethanedial between GD 6 – 19. Maternal toxicity occurred only at the highest dose while no effects were observed on any developmental parameters (BASF &amp; Clariant 2001). Based on these findings an oral LOAEL of 125 mg/kg-bw/day was derived for maternal toxicity, and an oral NOEL of &gt;125 mg/kg-bw/day was derived for developmental toxicity, in rats.</P><P>Oral developmental studies conducted in rabbits indicated that maternal toxicity occurred only at concentrations that were considered corrosive and damaging to the gastric mucosa. New Zealand white rabbits receiving 0, 166, 331 mg/kg-bw/day ethanedial, by gavage, experienced systemic toxicity, decreased weight, and decreased foetal weight at the high dose only. No effects were observed at exposures below the high-dose (NTP 1991d, 1992). From this study oral LOAELs of 331 mg/kg-bw/day were derived for both maternal and developmental toxicity in rabbit.</P><P>No reproductive studies were identified. However, the results of several -dose studies, summarised below, indicate that ethanedial does not affect the male reproductive tract except at very high doses. In a 90-day oral exposure (drinking water, 107, 234, 315 mg/kg-bw/day) toxicity study with male rats a dose-dependent decrease in the absolute weight of all organs except for the testes and brain was observed. There was also no change in the weight of the testes when rats were exposed by the same route for 180 days to a dose of 298 mg/kg-bw/day (Ueno et al. 1990a). Another 90-day toxicity study exposed male and female rats to ethanedial in the feed at doses up to 250 mg/kg-bw/day. No macroscopic or histopathological changes were noted in any organs in any dose groups (Mellon 1966). In a 90-day drinking water study, male rats (10/group) were exposed at levels up to approximately 2286 mg/kg-bw/day. At the highest-dose tested male rats experienced hypospermia in the epididymis with atypical cells and slight degenerative changes in the germ epithelium in the testes. It should be noted that at this dose all animals were removed from the study after 2-weeks, due to severe cachexia. The German Advisory Committee on Existing Chemicals suggested that the effects on the male reproduction system may have been due to cachexia of the animals due to decreased water intake (NTP 1991a, BG Chemie 1998).</P><P>Decreased body and organ weights and decreased food intake were the most consistently observed effects in rats, exposed by the oral route, in repeated-dose, short-term and sub-chronic bioassays. CrlCD(SD)Br rats (6/sex/group) were exposed to 40, 120, or 400 mg/kg-bw/day ethanedial via drinking water in a 28-day bioassay. Body weight gain was decreased by 8% and 2.5% in mid dose males and females, respectively, and by 32% and 15% in high-dose males and females, respectively. Food intake was decreased by 8% and 33% in males of the 120 and 400 mg/kg-bw/day groups, respectively. In females, the food intake was only decreased in the 400 mg/kg-bw/day group (18%). Water consumption also decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Authors noted that this may have been due to the palatability of the test substance. No effects on biochemical, haematological, or urinary parameters were identified in this study (Societe Francaise Hoechst 1987). An oral short-term LOAEL of 120 mg/kg-bw/day was identified in this study based on the decreases in body-weight gain and food intake.</P><P>Several sub-chronic investigations examined the effects of oral exposure to ethanedial on male SD rats. In one investigation male rats were exposed in the range of 107 – 451 mg/kg-bw/day (see Appendix IV), via the drinking water for 30, 60, 90, or 180 days in two phases (Ueno et al. 1991a). The first phase exposed rats to three doses for 30, 60, or 90 days, while the second phase exposed rats to the high dose only for 90 or 180 days. It should be noted that total exposure decreased in each exposure group as duration of exposure increased (i.e. – the low-dose for the 90 day group is lower than that for the 30 or 60 day groups etc.). The decrease in total exposures was probably due to decreased water consumption as dose and duration of exposure increased, which was likely related to the palatability of the test substance. Commonly observed effects were significant decreases in water consumption in the low dose groups and in body weight, and food and water consumption in the mid- and high-exposure groups. The absolute weights of livers, kidneys, hearts and spleens were decreased in a dose-dependent manner in all dose groups and exposure periods, and were significantly different than controls in the mid- and high-dose groups. Relative kidney weights were increased at the high-dose after 90 days compared to controls. After 180 days of exposure to the high-dose, relative liver, kidney, and heart weights were increased in comparison to controls. Biochemical analyses identified a significant decrease in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the high-dose group, significant decreases in alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT, AST), albumin, and total protein in the mid- and high-dose groups, and a significant reduction in total serum protein in the low-dose group of the rats exposed for 90-days. In the 30 and 60 day groups, ALT was significantly decreased in all exposure groups. After 180 days, AST was only slightly reduced while ALT and LDH levels were unaffected; however, total serum protein content was decreased significantly in the 180 day exposed animals. Furthermore, declines in the incorporation of L-[<SUP>3</SUP>H]leucine were observed in rats treated either intravenously (150 mg/kg- bw), or orally (1000 mg/kg-bw), with ethanedial as compared to those not receiving ethanedial, indicating that ethanedial does inhibit protein synthesis. In the 30-day bioassay, reductions in glyoxalase I and II activity were observed. However, levels of these enzymes were normal in the longer exposure groups. There were also no effects observed on levels of glutathione or 2-thiobarbituaric acid-active substances in the liver, kidney, or erythrocytes. After 180 days exposure to 298 mg/kg-bw/day, 2 animals experienced polyps and haemorrhage in the forestomach, which the authors did not consider to be related to test substance exposure. Additionally, 4 animals displayed slight swelling of the papillary epithelial cells in the kidneys, papillary edema, and congestion of the lymph nodes located near to the kidneys (Ueno 1991a).</P><P>A second investigation exposed Wistar rats to 40% ethanedial in the feed at concentrations of 32, 63, 125, or 250 mg/kg-bw/day for 90-days. Significant reductions in body weight were observed after 2 weeks, but were reversible. In contrast to the studies outlined above, absolute liver and kidney weights were increased in the high dose group. No examinations were carried out to assess macroscopic or micropathological effects on other organs. No biochemical or haematological parameters were investigated (Mellon Institute 1966). Similar effects were observed in other sub-chronic investigations of ethanedial toxicity (Summarised in Appendix IV).</P><P>From the aforementioned sub-chronic studies, a sub-chronic oral LOAEL of 107 mg/kg-bw/day is derived based on decreased total serum protein levels in the male SD rat. Decreased water consumption was also observed at this dosage, but, as mentioned above, was likely related to the palatability of the test substance. The authors of the study from which this oral LOAEL was derived concluded that sub-chronic exposures to glyoxal resulted in an overall low degree of systemic toxicity (Ueno et al. 1991a).</P><P>Exposure by the inhalation route was examined in one short-term bioassay. Wistar rats (5/sex/group) were exposed (nose-only) to nominal concentrations of 0, 0.4, 2, or 10 mg/m<SUP>3</SUP>ethanedial, with mean aerodynamic mass diameters of 0.8 – 1.2 µm, 6 hours per day, 6 days per week, for 29 days. At the mid- and high-exposure concentrations animals displayed minimal squamous metaplasia of the epiglottal epithelium in the larynx accompanied by sub-mucosal lymphoid cell infiltration. No other adverse events were noted. Based on these findings a short-term LOAEC of 2.3 mg/m<SUP>3</SUP> (Average measured concentration at the nominal 2 mg/m<SUP>3</SUP> dose) was derived based on local effects in the larynx (Hoechst 1995).</P><P>A ten-day range finding study was carried out to determine suitable dermal exposure levels for a chronic exposure bioassay in mice. Mice were exposed to 53 or 105 mg/kg-bw/day each day for ten days. At the highest dose, open sores formed on the skin. No other adverse effects were observed in this study (Bushy Run 1982). From this study a LOAEL of 105 mg/kg-bw/day was derived for site of contact effects following short-term dermal exposure in mice. No sub-chronic data was available to address dermal exposures.</P><P>Ethanedial is an irritant and a sensitizer. It is classified by the European Union as R36/38 (<EM>irritating to eyes and skin</EM>) and R45 (<EM>May cause sensitization by skin contact</EM>) (ESIS 2010). Positive results were reported for skin and mucous-membrane (eye) irritation in white rabbits in several assays (Smyth et al. 1962; <mark>BASF AG</mark> 1963a,b; Ito 1963; <mark>BASF AG</mark> 1985b,c; WHO 2004). Skin irritation appeared to be related to the concentration of the test substance and the length of exposure. Sensitization was investigated in both humans and guinea pigs. In humans, 24 volunteers were exposed to patches soaked with 10% ethanedial, 5 times for 48 hrs each time. Twenty-four hours after the final application of the induction phase, volunteers were exposed to 2% ethanedial, under occlusive conditions, for 48 hours. All volunteers experienced reactions (Kligman 1966). In a second human investigation, workers with occupational dermatitis, suspected to be due to contact with ethanedial 40, were patch tested with 20% ethanedial. Seven of nine workers tested had positive reactions to the patch testing (Ito, 1963). Exposure to “neat” ethanedial, in its powder form, caused no irritation nor did it elicit a sensitization reaction (Monsanto Co. 1969). Ethanedial was positive in both the maximization and Buehler tests in guinea pigs (<mark>BASF AG</mark> 1987; American Cyanamid Co. 1988).</P><P><STRONG>Detoxification and Metabolism of Endogenous Ethanedial</STRONG></P><P>Endogenous formation of ethanedial occurs within the cellular milieu through several non-enzymatic reactions such as the Maillard reaction (which occurs between sugars and amino acids), DNA oxidation, peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and UV photo-damage (Fig. 1). Additionally, conditions of oxidative stress and GSH depletion as well as the metabolism of glycoaldehydes, ethylene oxides, and β-hydroxy-substituted<EM>N</EM>-nitrosoamines can contribute to the formation of ethanedial <EM>in vivo</EM> (WHO 2004).</P><P><STRONG>Figure 1.</STRONG> Endogenous Formation and Detoxification of Ethanedial (Glyoxal) (Concise International Chemical Assessment Document 57, WHO 1994)</P><P>Ethanedial (Glyoxal) is efficiently detoxified within the body by rapid reaction with proteins, and by a specialized glyoxalase system. Glyoxal reacts non-enzymatically with GSH with formation of a hemithioacetal, which is subsequently converted to S-glycolylglutathione by glyoxalase I. Glyoxalase II catalyses the hydrolysis of S-glycolylglutathione to glycolate (a nongenotoxic substance), re-generating the GSH from the first reaction. Therefore, the intracellular concentration of GSH plays a key role in determining the activity of the glyoxalase system (Thornalley 1995; Sady et al. 2000. International Programme on Chemical Safety's Concise International Chemical Assessment Documents. Number 57: Glyoxal (2004)). Other enzymatic pathways can also contribute to ethanedial detoxification. These include the NADPH-dependent aldose reductases, aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH), and 2-oxoaldehyde dehydrogenase (Kuhla et al. 2005). Thus, there are a number of protective systems to ensure any potential ethanedial (Glyoxal) hazard is neutralized.</P><P>Under normal conditions, because of binding to macromolecules (ethanedial reacts with the arginine, cysteine, and lysine side-chains of proteins), very little free ethanedial is present in biological systems. This mechanism results in the reversible binding of greater than 90% of ethanedial in biological systems, leaving less than 10% of ethanedial free within the cell (Thornalley 1995).</P><P>No quantitative data is available for the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of exogenous ethanedial in either human or animal models. A concentration of 13.2 µM ethanedial was reported in normal human urine (number of subjects not reported) (Espinosa-Mansilla et al. 1998; WHO 2004). The blood plasma concentration of ethanedial has been measured in ‘normal’ patients and those with certain pathological conditions (diabetes mellitus, uraemia). Ethanedial concentrations were increased up to two fold in diabetics (Thornalley 1998, 2000). Agalou et al. measured concentrations of ethanedial in the blood plasma in healthy subjects, patients with mild to moderate uraemia, and patients with end-stage renal disease receiving haemodialysis and determined them to be 0.23±0.13 µmol/L (n=6), 0.4±0.16 µmol/L (n=10), and 0.76±0.21 µmol/L (n=5), respectively (Aagalou et al. 2002). A second study reported blood plasma concentrations of 0.3 µmol/L for healthy subjects (n=3), 0.45 µmol/L for patients with poorly controlled diabetes, and 0.47 µmol for patients with chronic renal failure (Lapolla et al. 2003). Thus, it is evident that diabetics and patients with renal failure can have increased levels of ethanedial present in the blood.</P><H3>Characterization of Risk to Human Health</H3><P>Based principally on its classification as a category 3 mutagen by the European Commission (EU 1996), genotoxicity is considered to be a critical effect for the characterization of risk to human health for ethanedial. Ethanedial was mutagenic in a range of<EM>in vitro</EM> assays and caused DNA strand breaks and increased unscheduled DNA synthesis in <EM>in vivo</EM> assays. However, these were confined mainly to the pyloric mucosa and liver, were statistically significant only at high doses delivered by gastric instillation, and did not occur in organs distant from the site of contact. Furthermore, rats exposed to drinking water containing ethanedial for up to 180 days did not display gastrointestinal effects, indicating that only with single concentrated doses do gastrointestinal effects become evident and that the method of animal dosing plays a role in the observed effects of ethanedial exposure. Rabbit studies performed by gavage confirm these observations, reporting corrosiveness in the GI tract in animals exposed to levels above 166 mg/kg-bw/day (mid-dose).</P><P>Protection from the potential effects of ethanedial exposure is provided by the glyoxalase system. The glyoxalase system is present within the cytosol of all cells and is known to be very efficient in reducing the amount of <mark>carbon</mark>yl stress caused by α-oxoaldehydes such as ethanedial. This efficiency is partly due to the system’s narrow substrate specificity, which detoxifies ethanedial and methylglyoxal almost exclusively (Thornalley 1994, 2003). In order for ethanedial to exert genotoxic effects <EM>in vivo</EM>, it would be necessary for levels to reach an intracellular concentration that could overwhelm protein sequestration and detoxification by the glyoxalase system. Other enzymes and enzymatic systems are also known to detoxify glyoxal including the NADPH-dependent aldose reductases, aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH), and 2-oxoaldehyde dehydrogenase (Kuhla et al. 2005).</P><P>Additionally, ethanedial is a potent cross-linker, and it is therefore likely that exposure to ethanedial at levels the general population may be expected to be exposed to, would not be readily absorbed, but would become bound to macromolecules at points of entry thereby preventing ethanedial from coming into contact with the genetic material.This in itself is considered to act as a protective barrier, preventing the manifestation of genotoxic effects. In <EM>in vitro</EM> assays, in which ethanedial tests positive for genotoxicity, individual cells do not have this protective barrier and are subject to relatively large concentrations of test substance that can penetrate cell membranes and interact with DNA. Thus, genotoxic effects are observed.</P><P>The carcinogenicity of ethanedial has not been investigated in oral or inhalation bioassays, and no data was identified regarding ethanedial’s carcinogenicity in humans. Mice exposed to ethanedial dermally for their entire lifespan did not have an increased incidence of neoplasias. Additionally, no pre-neoplastic changes were observed in oral studies of shorter lengths (6 months). An increase in the number of adenocarcinomas of the stomach was observed when rats were pre-treated with the known carcinogen<EM>N-</EM>methyl-<EM>N-</EM>nitro-<EM>N</EM>-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) before oral exposure (drinking water) to approximately 907 mg ethanedial/kg-bw/day for 32 weeks, indicating that ethanedial may act as a tumour promoter. However, no tumours were evident in the stomachs of rats receiving glyoxal only. Another straight chain unsaturated dialdehyde, pentanedialdehyde, has a similar mutagenic profile to ethanedial but was not considered carcinogenic in 2-year inhalation bioassays in F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice by the US National Toxicology Program (van Birgelen 2000). Ethylene glycol, a substance that is metabolized to glyoxal by oxidative dehydrogenation, (Kurina et al. 1998) was not carcinogenic in a 2-year oral feeding study in male and female mice (NTP 1993).</P><P>As discussed, efficient detoxification of ethanedial by the glyoxalase system, other enzymatic systems, and protein binding of free ethanedial are considered to prevent ethanedial from interacting with DNA within tissues distant from the points of contact. Although it is conceivable that tissues present at points of contact may have some susceptibility to the genotoxic effects of ethanedial, the absence of carcinogencity via the dermal route indicates this may not be relevant from a human health perspective. Very high exposures could potentially overwhelm systems and lead to the presentation of adverse effects. For example, the glyoxalase system is dependent on GSH as a catalyst for the detoxification of ethanedial. During very high exposures, GSH could be depleted leading to the accumulation of free ethanedial, which in turn could result in increased DNA damage, and formation of AGEs. However, considering the protective barriers in place, it is considered that ethanedial concentrations must overwhelm the glyoxalase system, protein binding and additional pathways of enzymatic detoxification in order to induce genotoxicity <EM>in vivo.</EM> Therefore, it is considered that ethanedial levels are required to surpass a threshold in order to induce genotoxic effects.</P><P>For all age groups, except infants fed breast milk or formula, the principle route of exposure to ethanedial is expected to be from the daily intake of food and beverages. With respect to non-genotoxic effects, comparisons of the upper-bounding estimates for total daily intake (0.3 to 84 µg/kg-bw per day) to the lowest non-cancer LOAEL for repeated exposure via the oral route of 107 mg/kg-bw per day (for reduced serum protein levels) results in margins of exposure (MOEs) ranging from 1 300 to 360 000. As a worst case scenario, the European Union proposed an intake estimate from food of 10 µg/day, or 160 µg/kg-bw (64 kg) per day from all environmental media, which is less conservative than the approach in this assessment despite the large concentration found in food (SCCP 2005). However, considering that some of the food data is not reflective of dietary needs, but rather occasional food items (e.g. beer and wine), it is likely that the actual margin of exposure for the general Canadian population is greater than those derived in this assessment.</P><P>Estimates of oral exposure are considered to be worst-case scenarios that overestimate the actual exposure of the general population to ethanedial and resulting margins of exposure are considered to be protective of non-cancer effects. While incidental oral exposure could theoretically occur via paper mouthed by young children, it is unlikely that ethanedial becomes bioavailable during such events.</P><P>Genotoxicity was observed in rats exposed orally, by gastric instillation; however, in the 90-day study from which the oral LOAEL of 107 mg/kg-bw per day was identified, no GI tract effects were noted. Additionally, genotoxicity was only statistically significant at doses several fold higher than the oral LOAEL and was only observed when ethanedial was administered acutely as a concentrated bolus dose, which is not reflective of the nature of exposures that could occur in the general population. Based on these observations and information on the metabolic fate of ethanedial, it is considered that the range of margins of exposure based on the comparisons of the oral LOAEL of 107 mg/kg-bw/day to the estimates of oral exposure are also protective against genotoxic effects in the human population.</P><P>Exposure to ethanedial via the dermal and inhalation routes could also occur within the general population. Based on consumer product modelling, the air concentration of ethanedial resulting from painting a room area was 0.11 µg/m<SUP>3</SUP>. Because painting is considered to be an acute exposure for the general population, the estimated exposure of 0.11 µg/m<SUP>3</SUP> was compared with the acute (7-hour) LOEC for inhalation of 4200 mg/m<SUP>3</SUP> (Appendix IV), which is based on an observed increase in breathing rate. This comparison results in a margin of exposure of 3.8 x 10<SUP>7</SUP>. The comparison of the dermal LOAEL of 105 mg/kg-bw per day (for local skin necroses) with the dermal exposure from paint splatter, 4.6 µg/kg-bw per day, gives a margin of exposure of 23 000.</P><P>The chronic exposure estimates from use of cosmetics and personal care products, including acne face wash, ranged from 0.071 mg/kg-bw per day (face wash) to 0.27 mg/kg-bw per day (body lotion). Comparing the short-term dermal effect level of 105 mg/kg-bw per day with these exposure estimates yields margins of exposure ranging from 390 to 1 500 000. When these exposures are compared to the single exposure administered to mice for their entire life-span (23 mg/kg-bw/day), for which no statistically significant effects were observed, margins of exposure ranging from 85 – 324 000 are derived. It should be noted that the estimated exposure from acne face wash is based on actual product concentrations of ethanedial, while the estimate for body lotion, and other cosmetics, are based on the maximum value within the reporting range from CNS, which is considered to be an overestimate. Therefore, the low end of the range of margins of exposure is considered to be much higher than reported here. The acute exposure estimates from use of hair dyes and manicure preparation products were 0.14 mg/kg-bw per event and 7.1 mg/kg-bw per event, respectively. Comparing the short-term dermal effect level of 105 mg/kg-bw with these exposure estimates yields margins of exposure of 750 and 15 000, respectively.</P><P>Comparing the acute (7-hour) LOEC for inhalation of 4200 mg/m<SUP>3</SUP> with the estimated mean event concentrations during use of of spray-on leave-in hair conditioner (0.04 mg/m<SUP>3</SUP>) manicure preparation products (0.42 µg/m<SUP>3</SUP>) yields margins of exposures of 105 000 and 1 x 10<SUP>7</SUP>, respectively.</P><P>These margins of exposure are considered adequate to address uncertainties in the health effects and exposure databases.</P><P>These margins of exposure are considered adequate to address uncertainties in the health effects and exposure databases.The margins of exposure derived above are all based on comparisons of conservative, upper-bounding estimates exposure of the general population to the critical effect levels identified for oral, inhalation, and dermal exposures of the appropriate durations. The derived margins of exposure are considered to be adequate to address uncertainties in the health effects and exposure databases.</P><H3>Uncertainties in Evaluation of Risk to Human Health</H3><P>The scope of this screening assessment does not include a full analysis of the mode of action of ethanedial, nor does it take into account possible differences between humans and experimental species in sensitivity or potential differences in toxicity due to route of exposure. Furthermore, there is uncertainty in the assessment due to the lack of data available to determine the carcinogenicity of this substance following chronic oral and inhalation dosing. There is also uncertainty concerning the effects of ethanedial exposure on reproductive toxicity, as the available information was limited to examinations of reproductive organs after shorter-term repeated-dose studies, although no ill-effects were observed on these organs except at exceedingly high exposure levels. There is moderate confidence in the database concerning non-cancer effects as there is data available that addresses, short-term, and sub-chronic effects induced by exposure through the oral route, and short-term effects induced by the inhalation route. Longer-term studies were not available for the inhalation route. There are also adequate studies that address developmental toxicity induced by the oral exposure route.</P><P>There is low confidence in the environmental media data concerning water, air, soil and food intakes due to the lack of available Canadian data and the requirement for environmental modelling via ChemCAN. Confidence in consumer products, however, is moderate due to the availability of data for ethanedial concentrations found in products. As modelled, the exposures from products are considered to be overestimates.</P><DIV class=""alignRight""><P><A href=""#top"" title=""Return to Top of Page"">Top of Page</A></P></DIV><H2>Conclusion</H2><P>On the basis of the adequacy of the margins between upper-bounding estimates of exposure to ethanedial and critical effect levels, it is concluded that ethanedial is not entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that constitute or may constitute a danger in Canada to human life or health.</P><P>Based on the information presented in this final screening assessment, it is concluded that ethanedial is not entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that have or may have an immediate or long-term harmful effect on the environment or its biological diversity or that constitute or may constitute a danger to the environment on which life depends. Additionally, ethanedial does not meet the criteria for persistence and bioaccumulation potential as set out in the <EM>Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations</EM> (Canada 2000)<EM>.</EM></P><P>It is therefore concluded that ethanedial does not meet any of the criteria under section 64 of CEPA 1999.</P><P>This substance will be considered for inclusion in the Domestic Substances List inventory update initiative. In addition and where relevant, research and monitoring will support verification of assumptions used during the screening assessment.</P><H2>References</H2><P>ACD/pK<SUB>a</SUB>DB [Prediction Module]. 2005.

Expectations for the group to endorse an ambitious <mark>climate</mark> and energy action plan are high but in this guest blog for ICC, Kurt Bock, Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and CEO of BASF, and Chairman of the Business-20 (B20) Taskforce on Energy, <mark>Climate</mark> &amp; Resource Efficiency says successful <mark>climate</mark> protection will only be possible through collective, global action.</P></SPAN><P>The Paris Agreement of December 2015 represented a breakthrough: After years of intense negotiations, 195 countries adopted the first global convention on <mark>climate</mark> protection at the United Nations <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference. The goal is to limit the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C compared with pre-industrial levels. The agreement entered into force at the beginning of November 2016. More than two-thirds of the signatory countries have already ratified it. We are now entering the phase where all countries have to rigorously implement the necessary measures. Successful <mark>climate</mark> protection will only be possible with collective, global action.</P><P>“The G20 countries have to work together: Successful <mark>climate</mark> protection will only be possible with collective, global action.”</P><P>During its G20 Presidency, Germany can provide impetus. This group, comprising 19 countries and the European Union, accounts for around three-quarters of global <mark>CO2</mark> emissions. Furthermore, the G20 members generate around 80% of global gross national income*. Their common goal should be to boost the innovative strength of industry and accelerate the development of technologies. Only in this way will industry be able to make its maximum contribution to <mark>climate</mark> protection.</P><P>Companies such as BASF are very actively engaged in the Business 20 (B20), the forum for business representatives from the G20 states – including in the Energy, <mark>Climate</mark> and Resource Efficiency Taskforce. An important milestone in this process is the B20 Summit in early May 2017 in Berlin. What is our focus?</P><P>Even if the countries implement all of the currently agreed nationally determined contributions (NDCs), the international community will only be able to limit global warming to 3°C. Furthermore, countries that do not reach their targets will not face sanctions. Since in many countries growth, jobs and prosperity are still more important than <mark>climate</mark> protection, the global community is facing a major challenge in this respect.</P><P><STRONG>Collective, global action on <mark>climate</mark> protection</STRONG></P><P>For example, Germany – a country that accounts for barely 2% of global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions – cannot on its own contribute all that much to reducing emissions. Therefore, the G20 countries in particular have to work together. Europe currently has the world’s most ambitious goals for reducing greenhouse gases. Consequently, European industry bears a heavier burden than its international competitors. We therefore urgently need fair competitive conditions and a global approach to regulation. Otherwise, the energy and raw material costs in Germany and Europe – which are already high in worldwide comparison – will continue to rise and put the region at even more of a disadvantage. We would then have to reduce or even close production sites in Europe. Instead of exporting, we would import – likely from countries with a worse <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, since the energy and <mark>climate</mark> efficiency standards  are lower in most countries outside of Europe. This does not support <mark>climate</mark> protection.</P><P><STRONG><mark>Climate</mark> protection requires <mark>innovation</mark></STRONG></P><P>Effective global <mark>climate</mark> protection requires <mark>innovation</mark>s. And <mark>innovation</mark>s require a competitive industry which can advance the research and development of energy-efficient products and processes.</P><P>With its products, the chemical industry contributes to saving energy, avoiding emissions and therefore to achieving the greenhouse gas reduction targets. For example, the energy required to heat a single-family house built in the 1960s with an area of 160 m2 can be reduced by around 60% by insulating the exterior walls. In renewable energy generation with wind turbine systems, curing agents and resin systems are decisive for the size and lifespan of the rotor blades and thus for the economic efficiency of the plants.</P><P>Furthermore, the utilization of chemical products over their life cycles avoids many times the amount of <mark>CO2</mark> that was emitted during their production. We need the <mark>innovation</mark>s that come from industry in order to make the transition to renewable energies economically viable and to reduce energy consumption and <mark>CO2</mark> emissions in other sectors, such as construction and transportation. The important role played by industry should be recognized, especially by the G20.</P><P>In addition to the innovative contributions that chemical products are making to <mark>climate</mark> protection, the chemical industry has already made its production extremely efficient. The German chemical industry reduced its emissions by 47% between 1990 and 2014, making it a pioneer in Germany. At BASF, we have also accomplished a lot: While we have doubled our sales volumes since 1990, we have been able to cut our greenhouse gas emissions by half in absolute terms and by 75% when measured per metric ton of product. At this level, it becomes more and more challenging to develop new technological options to further avoid <mark>CO2</mark> emissions.</P><P><STRONG>Recommendations of the B20 Taskforce</STRONG></P><P>In the B20 Energy, <mark>Climate</mark> &amp; Resource Efficiency Taskforce, we address these developments and needs, and we focus our recommendations on three core topics:</P><P>First, we call for the establishment of a G20 <mark>Carbon</mark> Pricing Platform to accelerate the development of global pricing mechanisms. The aim is to create a dialogue forum to share experiences with greenhouse gas pricing mechanisms, such as emissions trading.</P><P>Second, we recommend the development of a G20 Energy <mark>Innovation</mark> Action Plan. This would enable governments to create incentives to develop and use innovative technologies, including digital solutions. This could bring about an enormous reduction in emissions.</P><P>And third, we suggest the creation of a G20 Resource Efficiency Platform. Resource efficiency is essential to succeed amid international competition and it can also lead to <mark>sustainable</mark> economic development. The information network proposed by the B20 will strengthen knowledge transfer and collaboration on technological developments and <mark>innovation</mark>s, in order to optimize resource use.</P><P><STRONG>Outlook</STRONG></P><P>And the G20 countries can do even more: At the moment, we are seeing a very volatile political environment. This makes it more difficult for industry to play its key role in <mark>climate</mark> protection and to push forward with the necessary <mark>innovation</mark>s. For companies, it is therefore even more important that the G20 recognizes the key function that industry plays in achieving the <mark>climate</mark> targets set out in the Paris Agreement. The G20 should create a regulatory framework that fosters <mark>innovation</mark> and enables fair competition between industrial companies on a global playing field. Industry will then be able to fully utilize its innovative power and shape <mark>climate</mark> protection in an environmentally friendly, socially responsible and economical way.</P><P>* World Bank (2014)</P></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Eighty-one journalists from 25 countries were in attendance at the event, held in the heart of the company’s operations in Ludwigshafen and surrounding region, including Limburgerhof.</P><P>The event highlighted how crucial seeds are for one of the world’s largest chemistry giants. Held just days before the merger of Monsanto and Bayer was announced on Sept. 14, the global press conference allowed BASF to showcase its business plans and some of the people responsible for shaping those plans.</P><P>“Our investment in this expanded capacity is a step forward to unlocking the agricultural potential in seeds and crops in different and untapped ways,” said Philipp Rosendorfer, vice president R&amp;D Functional Crop Care for BASF’s Crop Protection division.</P><P>The research on biological solutions, which consists of naturally occurring organisms or extracts thereof, provides great opportunities to complement BASF’s chemical crop protection, he said. Moreover, the combination between chemistry and biology generates a new range of pioneering solutions for seed treatment.</P><P>“With BASF’s unique skills in research and state-of-the art formulations, we are one of a few companies that can provide a seed treatment with a mixture of both biological and chemical compounds. This means farmers can have a well-protected and strengthened crop right from the beginning of its life.”</P><P>Ulf Schlotterbeck has been working with BASF Seed Solutions for 10 years now. Now the head for BASF Seed Solutions Technology, he notes that BASF is the only major crop protection company not offering seeds. That allows it to concentrate fully on seed solutions, and not seeds themselves.</P><P>“We are dealing with the application of the products to the seeds,” he says, and notes this gives the company a unique edge in being able to concentrate on seed solutions for growers.</P><P>“Seed treatment is one of the most important crop protection measures you can have, because you apply the active ingredient right where it’s needed — on the surface of the seed. It’s ecologically and economically a very attractive crop protection measure.”</P><DIV id=""attachment_2098"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 800px""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Ulf Schlotterbeck, head of seed solutions technology, gives a tour of the company’s new seed R&amp;D center.</P></DIV><H3>Shaping Itself for the Future</H3><P>With an area of approximately 10 square kilometres, BASF’s Ludwigshafen Verbund site is the world’s largest integrated chemical complex. As the headquarters of BASF, it is also the cradle of the Verbund concept, where production facilities, energy flows and logistics are networked together intelligently in order to utilise resources as efficiently as possible.</P><P>The company has a long history at its Ludwigshafen site in southwestern Germany, now employing a workforce of over 39,000. It also plays an indispensable role in the company history books.</P><P>That rich history formed the backdrop for the 2016 Global Press Conference. As a company with humble beginnings in Ludwigshafen that has grown into a global chemistry giant, it was fitting that Crop Protection Division president Markus Heldt noted that the company is, “Willing and ready to invest to grow its business globally.”</P><P>He’s worked in the industry for 35 years and has witnessed a plethora of changes in that time, including consolidation that’s served to change the landscape of the global ag business.</P><P>That landscape has changed even more now that Bayer announced its buyout of Monsanto for $66 billion. The combined agriculture business will have its global Seeds &amp; Traits and North American commercial headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri, its global Crop Protection and overall Crop Science headquarters in Monheim, Germany, and an important presence in Durham, North Carolina, as well as many other locations throughout the U.S. and around the world.</P><P>According to Heldt, BASF is more than confident in its ability to cope with the changing industry landscape and be agile and ready to adapt to shifting times. It’s been doing so since its inception.</P><P>The story is long and detailed, but goes like this. Entrepreneur Friedrich Engelhorn, who owned a coal gas company in the nearby city of Mannheim, very quickly recognizes the opportunities for coal tar, a byproduct of his company’s business. But he has bigger ideas — a company that spans the entire production process, from raw materials and auxiliaries through precursors and intermediates to dyes.</P><P>In April of 1865, Engelhorn turns his idea into reality. He founds a stock corporation in Mannheim under the name Badische Anilin- &amp; Sodafabrik. After the planned acquisition of a site in Mannheim falls through, the manufacturing facilities are built on the opposite side of the Rhine River in Ludwigshafen, then part of the kingdom of Bavaria. BASF is born.</P><P>BASF has always been proud of its ability to succeed no matter the circumstances, and Heldt says this ability will help carry it into the future.</P><P>“We believe size on its own — or just bundling technologies of seed and chemistry, for example — is not a recipe for success,” Heldt said. “Farmers want freedom to choose, and that’s why we’re convinced they enjoy having access to different suppliers, and not just three or four on a global scale. We see our position as robust and strong. We have a strong local footprint in all markets and an outstanding pipeline.”</P><P>BASF’s current crop protection pipeline of <mark>innovation</mark>s has new product candidates from all indications in advanced phases. The company estimates that peak sales from crop protection products launched between 2015 and 2025 will total 3 billion euros.</P><P>One example is the company’s latest fungicide, Revysol. Currently under registration by European authorities, this compound has shown outstanding biological performance against a range of pathogens, as well as a favourable regulatory profile, according to the company.</P><P>BASF strives to complement its traditional crop protection offerings to provide farmers with new technologies, like its new digital farming platform Maglis. According to Matthias Nachtmann, team lead digital farming for BASF, Maglis is BASF’s most significant accomplishment in the area of digital farming.</P><P>Launched at the beginning of 2016, Maglis helps farmers to gather, interpret, and monitor a range of crop-related data that will result in better decision-making on how to grow and market crops.</P><DIV id=""attachment_2099"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 800px""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Markus Heldt, president of BASF Crop Protection, holds up a kilogram of the company’s Nodulator product, a highly efficient active strain of rhizobium, selected to perform on soybean seed.</P></DIV><H3>Adding Value</H3><P>According to Heldt, seed solutions form a major strategic pillar for BASF.</P><P>“Everything around seed — protecting seed and improving the value of seed — is very important,” he said, including biological seed treatment products.</P><P>Heldt holds up a small jar containing about one kilogram of BASF’s Nodulator product, a highly efficient active strain of rhizobium, selected to perform on soybean seed. It contains 80 billion rhizobia.</P><P>“That one kilogram of product treats 1,000 kilograms of soybean seed,” he said. “It shows how our biological products complement conventional chemistry and add value for customers and our portfolio.”</P><P>Developing solutions derived from the combination of chemical and biological expertise is another important focus of BASF’s growth strategy. The company is one of the few that can provide, for example, a seed treatment product with a mixture of both biological and chemical compounds. The investment in biological solutions, which consist of naturally occurring organisms or plant extracts, will yield a number of benefits for farmers, including the availability of further modes of action that can lead to improved resistance management.</P><P>The recent opening of a new R&amp;D center for biologicals and seed solutions at the division’s headquarters in Limburgerhof will further accelerate the development of new products in these areas.</P><P>For the remainder of 2016, BASF expects the agricultural market to remain volatile and the business environment to be challenging. Based on current developments, the financial goal for the Crop Protection division in 2016 is to strive for the same profitability level it reached in 2015.</P><P>“Our sales force will be close to our customers. We will intensify our sales efforts, supported by the launch of new products and formulations,” said BASF board member Harald Schwager, who opened the 2016 Global Press Conference.</P><P>“Changes lead to new opportunities for business growth and differentiation. We can look back with pride on BASF’s 100-year legacy of accomplishments in bringing breakthrough solutions for farmers to the market.

Through this and related moves, Bayer is confident of fully addressing all concerns of the European Commission. 
On October 13, 2017, Bayer had already agreed to sell selected Crop Science businesses to BASF for 5.9 billion euros. This first package covers Bayer’s global glufosinate-ammonium business and the related LibertyLink™ technology for herbicide tolerance, essentially all of the company’s field crop seed businesses, and the respective research and development capabilities. The seed businesses being divested include the global cotton seed business (excluding India and South Africa), the oilseed rape/canola business in North America and Europe, and the soybean seed business.
Any sales and licenses would be subject to a successful closing of the proposed acquisition of Monsanto, which remains subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. The European Commission recently extended the examination deadline for the acquisition until April 5. Bayer is working closely with the authorities worldwide in order to successfully close the transaction in the second quarter of 2018.	<B>About Bayer</B>

The first, published Monday morning by The Guardian, suggested USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service has instructed staff during the Trump era to avoid use of the term “<mark>climate change</mark>.” It drew an immediate repudiation from USDA. The second was an unpublished government report on <mark>climate change</mark>, leaked to and published by The New York Times, that placed human activity at the center of a rise in temperatures in the U.S. since 1980 that has made recent decades the warmest in the past 1,500 years.</P><P class=""story-continued"">Story Continued Below</P><P>From a headline perspective, anyway, when it rains it pours. The Guardian published a <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/07/usda-<mark>climate</mark>-change-language-censorship-emails"" target=""_blank"">series of emails</A> by career officials at the conservation service, indicating that using the term “<mark>climate change</mark>” was a no-no and that “weather extremes” should be used instead. The phrase “build organic soil matter,” the emails revealed, was preferred to “reduce greenhouse gases.” The Feb. 16 memo from Bianca Moebius-Clune, director of NRCS’ soil health division, also instructed staff to talk about how soil health increases opportunities for economic and business growth and production efficiency.</P><P><B>USDA officials were quick to push back.</B> USDA spokesman Tim Murtaugh told MA in a phone interview that “there has never been a directive to NRCS regarding the term ‘<mark>climate change</mark>’” and that it was unclear why the career officials behind the memos had raised the issue to staff. A spokesman for NRCS in an email backed Murtaugh’s response. “The Natural Resources Conservation Service has not received direction from USDA or the administration to modify its communications on <mark>climate change</mark> or any other topic,” the spokesman said.</P><P><B>Internet check:</B> It was unclear whether NRCS officials have curbed use of the term “<mark>climate change</mark>” since earlier this year. A quick search on the department’s website found that USDA’s conservation arm still has a page on the issue that highlights adaptation and mitigation efforts. “<mark>Climate change</mark> poses environmental, social, and agricultural challenges that require adaptation measures to help human and natural systems adjust to new or changing climatic patterns,” NRCS says on the <A href=""https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/<mark>climate</mark>change/"" target=""_blank"">site</A>. </P><P><B><mark>Climate change</mark> eggshells:</B> The Trump administration’s stance on <mark>climate change</mark> and actions on scientific issues has the environmental and scientific community permanently on edge, so it’s not surprising that the emails — which don’t seem to include any transition officials — would cause a stir. President Donald Trump has long questioned the existence of <mark>climate change</mark>, once calling it a “hoax” perpetuated by the Chinese, and has been mum on whether he thinks it is <A href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/01/trump-<mark>climate</mark>-change-belief-239037"" target=""_blank"">caused by humans</A>. The Trump administration has pulled the U.S. out of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> deal and changed <mark>climate</mark>-change-related webpages for EPA and other government agencies to reflect its skepticism about the science.</P><P><B>HAPPY TUESDAY, AUGUST 8! </B>Welcome to Morning Ag, where your host is admittedly a little grumpy about being back in D.C. but very thankful for cleaner air. Smoke from wildfires in British Columbia has <A href=""http://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/local/article165660972.html"" target=""_blank"">engulfed much of Washington state</A> for the past week. The air quality is still <A href=""https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/enviwa/"" target=""_blank"">quite bad</A> across much of the state. You know the deal: Thoughts, news, tips?

Follow the whole team at<A href=""https://twitter.com/Morning_Ag"" target=""_blank""> @Morning_Ag</A>.</P><P><B>LEAKED REPORT: <mark>CLIMATE CHANGE</mark> IS HERE AND HUMANS ARE CONTRIBUTING: </B>The interagency report published by The New York Times on Monday night concluded that Americans are already seeing serious effects of <mark>climate change</mark> and that human activity is a significant contributor to rising temperatures — findings that run counter to the Trump administration’s position. </P><P>“The report was completed this year and is part of the National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment, which is congressionally mandated every four years. The <A href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_academy_of_sciences/index.html?inline=nyt-org"" target=""_blank"">National Academy of Sciences</A> has signed off on the draft and is awaiting permission from the Trump administration to release it,” the report said.</P><P>The document states it is “extremely likely” that more than half of global average temperature increases can be “linked” to human activities. The Times report also suggested scientists within the federal government are worried the Trump administration would suppress the report. Read the full story <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/<mark>climate</mark>/<mark>climate</mark>-change-drastic-warming-trump.html"" target=""_blank"">here</A>. </P><P><B>PERDUE DEFENDS CLOVIS: </B>It remains to be seen whether Senate Democrats are upset enough about Sam Clovis’ inflammatory comments on race — not to mention his past statement that crop insurance is unconstitutional — to derail his nomination to serve as chief USDA scientist. But we know Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue will be sticking by the pick as the nomination battle plays out. </P><P>Perdue on Monday defended Clovis when questioned by reporters about controversial comments Clovis made in 2011 and 2012 on a <A href=""https://www.politicopro.com/agriculture/story/2017/08/clovis-targets-progressives-socialist-barack-obama-in-old-blog-posts-160407"" target=""_blank"">since-deleted blog</A>, and said the CNN report that brought the statements to light was nothing more than a smear campaign. He also shot down criticism that Clovis is not qualified for the post. The administration has <A href=""https://www.politicopro.com/energy/story/2017/07/the-sam-clovis-factor-160036"" target=""_blank"">taken heat on the left</A> for nominating Clovis to a position that by law must be drawn from “among distinguished scientists with specialized training or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.”</P><P>“I don’t necessarily buy the issue that you have to be [a scientist] to manage that field and guide our capabilities,” Perdue said. “This person that is undersecretary of [research, education and economics] is not going to be doing basic applied research. That’s not what the job calls for.” Clovis has a Ph.D. in public administration. He taught business, management and public policy at Morningside College, a small liberal arts school in Iowa. He was an early supporter of Trump’s campaign, serving as co-chair and policy adviser.</P><P><B>Perdue’s comments were the first public response from the administration</B> after the CNN report last week, which highlighted how Clovis once called progressives “liars, race-traders and race-’traitors’” and accused labor unions of coming out of the “Communist closet” to support President Barack Obama. Perdue told reporters he was unfamiliar with those remarks, but accused the media of taking part in an effort to tear Clovis down. “That’s what the opposition does … they dredge up these stories,” he said. </P><P>Perdue said he would work to ease concerns over Clovis — a <mark>climate change</mark> skeptic — arguing that he trusts him to ensure the department engages in sound science. &quot;I fully support his nomination,” Perdue said. “I’ll do everything I can in the confirmation process.” </P><P><B>PERDUE LOOKS TO INDUSTRY FOR DICAMBA FIX:</B> Perdue doesn’t want to have to get involved in finding a solution for how to keep certain formulations of dicamba used on Monsanto’s Roundup Ready Xtend crops from damaging neighboring crops. “I’m hoping that the industry itself and the producers themselves are working toward a resolution,” the secretary told reporters Monday. “I would much prefer that method rather than a prescriptive, top-down regulation.”</P><P>Thousands of complaints have been filed across the Southeast and Midwest — <A href=""http://www.aad.arkansas.gov/arkansas-dicamba-information-updates"" target=""_blank"">Arkansas</A> alone has had 845 — by farmers who say their crops have been damaged by drift from the highly volatile herbicide. The situation has gotten so bad that some states have banned the herbicide, and a group of soybean and watermelon farmers filed <A href=""http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/arkansasmatters/document_dev/2017/06/15/Dicamba%20Complaint%20-%20Class%20Action_1497537976264_22796036_ver1.0.pdf"" target=""_blank"">suit</A> in federal court against Monsanto and BASF, which makes the herbicide, to recoup profits lost due to spoiled crops. Last week, Monsanto <A href=""https://monsanto.com/products/product-stewardship/articles/to-our-farmer-customers/"" target=""_blank"">said</A> it is taking the situation “extremely seriously.” It said it will offer support to farmers who have experienced problems with their crops and work to better educate growers of Roundup Ready Xtend crops.</P><P><B>PERDUE PREPS FOR NAFTA REWRITE: </B>Perdue plans on being in D.C. next week when formal NAFTA renegotiation talks begin. The secretary told reporters Monday that he will be engaged in the conversation, and he’ll work with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on ag issues. </P><P>There are a few areas where Perdue wants to see changes — easing controls on Canadian dairy and timber and Mexican pork, for example — but his focus will be on protecting agriculture. “The mantra I’ve continued to promulgate in the White House is first of all, do no harm to ag,” Perdue said.</P><P><B>ROAD TRIP FUEL: </B>Perdue wraps up his “Back to Our Roots” road trip across the Midwest in Indianapolis today with an event at Colt’s training camp to promote good nutrition and then a visit to the Indiana State fair. All told, Perdue’s RV will have covered more than 1,000 miles across five states, with a host of stops each day to get feedback from farmers and agribusiness on the farm bill and rural issues. While the secretary and his staff are digesting all of the information they received, MA had to ask: What does the head of the U.S. food production system eat on a road trip? Though Perdue and his staff captured a lot of the trip on Twitter, his meals were largely undocumented, with the exception of this <A href=""https://twitter.com/SecretarySonny/status/894322707445284864/photo/1"" target=""_blank"">mammoth cinnamon roll</A> in Davenport, Iowa, and a <A href=""https://twitter.com/SecretarySonny/status/893160289339920384/photo/1"" target=""_blank"">burger</A> enjoyed while chatting with farmers in Wisconsin. </P><P>A USDA spokesman tells MA that the RV was stocked with Coke products, nuts, fruit — specifically oranges, apples and bananas — and granola bars. The most popular items: Soy-and-wasabi-flavored almonds and cream puffs acquired at the Wisconsin state fair.</P><P><B>You can take the secretary out of Georgia, but ... : </B>Perdue gave a shout-out to one of his home state’s most iconic products in a <A href=""https://twitter.com/SecretarySonny/status/894602240492744705/photo/1"" target=""_blank"">tweet</A> following a farm bill discussion with Illinois Agriculture Director Raymond Poe and members of the Illinois Farm Bureau on Monday. “Got to peel back stifling regulations like a sweet Vidalia onion, one layer at a time. <A href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BackToOurRoots"" target=""_blank"">#BackToOurRoots</A> tour in Rochester, Illinois.” </P><P><B>VEGAN GROUP PETITIONS USDA OVER MYPLATE: </B>The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a vegan advocacy group made up of thousands of doctors,is filing a petition this week that will urge USDA to nix the focus on protein and dairy in its federal nutrition advice. MyPlate, which replaced the Food Pyramid under the Obama administration, currently recommends a quadrant of the plate be filled with protein. It also recommends dairy on the side. PCRM argues that instead of protein, which can be found in vegetables and grains, the protein quadrant should instead promote the “legumes food group.”</P><P>“MyPlate should focus only on essential food groups,” the petition says. “Vegetables, fruits, grains, and legumes are staples available in all grocery stores and familiar to all Americans. Together these four food groups provide the nutrients necessary for a healthful diet that maintains a healthy body weight and prevents disease.”</P><P><B>EGG SCANDAL EXPANDS IN EUROPE: </B>Eggs contaminated with the insecticide fipronil may have been sold in some seven countries, POLITICO EU reported Monday. Per our colleagues across the Atlantic: “Dutch authorities said in late July that they had shut poultry farms after finding high levels of fipronil — an insecticide banned for use on farm animals because of its danger to human health — in batches of eggs. A Belgian company is under investigation for creating an illegal mite-killer containing fipronil. Belgium launched an investigation in June, but did not notify the European Commission until July. Germany, which receives Dutch egg shipments, launched its own investigation in July.” More <A href=""http://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-warns-egg-scandal-could-now-involve-seven-countries/?utm_content=buffer47d41&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer"" target=""_blank"">here</A>. </P><P><B>MA’S INSTANT OATS:</B></P><P>— Sen. <A href=""https://cd.politicopro.com/member/140963"" target=""_blank"">Elizabeth Warren</A> has put a hold on the nomination of Makan Delrahim, Trump’s pick to run DOJ’s antitrust division, over her concerns that he would be pro-consolidation, Bloomberg <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-07/trump-s-pick-for-antitrust-chief-is-said-to-be-blocked-by-warren"" target=""_blank"">reports</A>. </P><P>— The widely held belief that poor people eat more junk food than rich people is not true, so say two academics in this <A href=""https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/7/16011002/junk-food-rich-poor-people"" target=""_blank"">Vox</A> piece. </P><P>— Is John Kelly as White House chief of staff good news for agriculture?

This is not surprising as the use of biomass induces a <mark>sustainable</mark> use of <mark>carbon</mark> i.e. <mark>carbon</mark> absorbed by plants is used to produce bio-based products, which is then released at the end of the products life cycle (so called ‘green <mark>carbon</mark>’) without increasing the atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration.</STRONG></P><P>The bio-based economy has therefore the potential to offer solutions to one of the biggest challenges of our time, but at the same time, it is not <mark>sustainable</mark> or <mark>climate</mark> friendly per se. A new paper by nova-Institute, prepared for the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), examines the relationship between the bio-based economy and <mark>climate change</mark>. The report gives a comprehensive overview on the discussion bio-based economy and <mark>climate change</mark>. What you have to consider along the whole value chain? Bio-based experts often take it for sure, that bio-based products have GHG emissions benefits – on the other hand environmental experts often see no advantaged anymore.

This drought resulted in significant food and economic losses due to reductions in barge traffic, the volume of goods carried, and the number of Americans employed by the tugboat industry. The 2012 drought was immediately followed by flooding throughout the Mississippi in the spring of 2013, which also resulted in disruptions of barge traffic and food transport.<SUP><A href=""#ref3"">[3]</A></SUP> Transportation changes such as these reduce the ability of farmers to export their grains to international markets, and can affect global food prices.</P><P>Impacts to the global food supply concern the United States because food shortages can cause humanitarian crises and national security concerns.  They also can increase domestic food prices. </P><P class=""pagetop""><A href=""#main-content"">Top of Page</A></P><H3>References</H3><P><SMALL>[1] USGCRP (2014). Hatfield, J., G.

                </SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN></SPAN>Over the long term, coal will be the cornerstone of a sustainability-focussed energy supply both on a global and on a national scale. For this reason RWE is pressing ahead with the development of technologies that will provide us with a foundation for <mark>sustainable</mark> coal-based power generation. The focus of our work lies on lignite, one of our domestic resources. If you want to achieve the CO<SUB>2</SUB> reduction targets set by policy-makers, over the long term you will need to implement <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage (CCS). This holds especially true when taking account of the planned nuclear phase-out. Solely due to the long investment cycles in the power plant sector – typically 40 years – it will take several decades before the new power plants equipped with fully integrated CO<SUB>2</SUB> capture technology will be widely realized. Thus, at an early stage RWE Power made a decision to develop advanced CO<SUB>2</SUB> scrubbing technology; from today’s point of view, CO<SUB>2</SUB> scrubbing is the only <mark>carbon</mark> capture technique that allows retrofitting into existing power plants and industrial plants in the medium term.</P></DIV><DIV id=""anchor_2724"" class=""contentItem edit_2724""><H4>How does CO<SUB>2</SUB> scrubbing work?</H4><P>In principle, the basic CO<SUB>2</SUB>-scrubbing process is very simple. In an absorber about 90% of the CO<SUB>2</SUB> contained in the flue gas can be bound to a CO<SUB>2</SUB> solvent at a relatively low temperature and, hence, removed. By raising the temperature, the solvent  “loaded” with CO<SUB>2</SUB> is rid of it in a desorber and subsequently transported as a lean solvent back to the absorber, where the scrubbing cycle starts again. The captured CO<SUB>2</SUB> has a high degree of purity and after being compressed is available for transport and underground storage or CO<SUB>2</SUB> usage.</P><H4>Cooperation with BASF and Linde to further develop CO<SUB>2</SUB> scrubbing technology</H4><P><SPAN style=""display:table-cell; width:290px;"" class=""float--left blowupPic""><SPAN class=""img-icon-wrapper""><A title="""" class=""image-popup-no-margins"" href=""/web/cms/mediablob/en/2722/blowupData/3/blob.jpg""><SPAN class=""gallery-button""><SPAN class=""img-button zoom"">

                </SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN><SPAN class=""caption""><mark>CO2</mark> scrubbing process overview </SPAN></SPAN>CO<SUB>2</SUB> scrubbing has been used successfully in the chemical, petroleum, and gas industries for a long time, though under process conditions that – in some instances – differ considerably from those that are relevant for use in power plants. Hence, what could be more logical than pooling the relevant expertise of strong partners, adapting the technology to our needs, and improving energy and economic efficiency of <mark>carbon</mark> scrubbing to such an extent that it meets our requirements? In BASF and Linde we have found two partners for this purpose that are global leaders in their respective fields and complement each other perfectly.</P><P>A new CO<SUB>2</SUB> solvent developed by BASF and optimized capture plant technology developed by Linde form the basis of the optimized CO<SUB>2</SUB> scrubbing technology. The use of the <SPAN xml:lang=""EN"">jointly developed</SPAN> CO<SUB>2</SUB> scrubbing technology will permit <SPAN xml:lang=""EN"">power plants to capture</SPAN> 90% of CO<SUB>2</SUB> of the flue gas and either utilize it to make other products or store it underground.</P><H4>Erection of a pilot CO<SUB>2</SUB> scrubbing plant at RWE’s Niederaussem power plant site</H4><P>Within the scope of a cooperation scheme with the companies BASF and Linde, we erected a pilot plant at the existing Niederaussem power plant site. The pilot plant was commissioned on 18 August 2009. In the course of the preperations, CO<SUB>2</SUB> could be separated from the flue-gas of a conventional coal power plant in Germany for the first time as early as June 2009. The pilot CO<SUB>2</SUB> scrubbing plant was built by Linde at the 1,000-MW BoA 1 lignite-fired unit, which, with a net efficiency of over 43% - together with the two new power plant units BoA 2&amp;3 at the Neurath site -, is the most modern and most efficient lignite-fired unit worldwide. In Niederaussem, the new <mark>carbon</mark> capture technology can thus be adapted to this type of power plant in an ideal manner.</P><P>The height of the pilot CO<SUB>2</SUB> scrubbing plant (40 m) corresponds to that of the future commercial plant. The plant also comprises all individual components of large plants, but on a smaller scale. The diameter of the absorber column was limited to the size required to obtain representative results. Depending on the set test parameters, up to 300 kg CO<SUB>2</SUB> per hour can be separated from a flue gas bypass (corresponds to a capture rate of 90 %).</P><P><SPAN xml:lang=""EN-GB"">During phase 1 of the CO<SUB>2</SUB> scrubbing plant’s pilot operation, initial operating experience was gained until March 2011 and various scrubbing agents tested under real operating conditions in three trials lasting six months each in order to finally identify an optimum solving agent. Between the start of the trial operation and the end of phase 1 of the development programme, more than 10,000 test hours were realized.</SPAN></P><H4><SPAN xml:lang=""EN-GB"">Breakthrough in the separation of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from the flue gases of coal-fired power plants</SPAN></H4><P>The results of the practical tests conducted to investigate the innovative CO<SUB>2</SUB> capture technology are encouraging. Compared with the customary processes used today, energy consumption can be reduced by some 20 percent with this technology. In addition, the new solvents feature much higher stability towards oxygen, so that solvent consumption is lowered substantially. Under the name OASE® blue, BASF incorporated the best solvent into its product catalogue. With a plant availability of more than 97%, the pilot plant has exceeded all expectations.</P><P>In phase 2 of the test programme further process optimizations in the plant were implemented. The design of the CO<SUB>2</SUB> absorber, where the CO<SUB>2</SUB> is separated from the flue gas, was improved by Linde in 2011, so that <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide can be scrubbed even more efficiently from the flue gas. For this purpose, newly developed high-performance packings were installed. The aim of these honeycombed metal packings is to further increase the exchange surface and enhence the contact time between liquid scrubbing agent and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. The CO<SUB>2</SUB> in the power plant’s flue gas can then be bound even more easily by the scrubbing liquid. The reconstruction work started mid-2011 and was completed by the end of that year.The tests so far were successful: The cross-sectional area of the absorbers could be reduced by more than 35%. This will allow CO<SUB>2</SUB> absorbers for major power plants, for example, to be smaller in size and erected at lower costs. </P><P><SPAN xml:lang=""EN"">To optimise the emission reduction system, a new emission mitigation system was also retrofitted into the absorber in 2011 and tested. This system helps to further lower the emission of solvent traces. At the Niederaussem location, several highly effective methods were identified to avoid this emission path via the head of the absorber.</SPAN><SPAN xml:lang=""EN"">The optimized technology will be trialled in phase 3 of the development project in an extended time test. In this phase, advanced, high-resolution online measuring methods are used and trialed. The results obtained in this test will provide valuable insights for a commercial-scale use of the CCS technology that, according to leading members of the Intergovernmental Panel of <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC), will play a key role in combating <mark>climate change</mark>. At the end of 2014, the plant had been in operation for a total of 34,000 hours, more than 26,000 hours of these with the</SPAN><SPAN xml:lang=""EN-US"">OASE® blue technology.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN xml:lang=""EN"">Future activities of the development programme in Niederaussem will particularly focus on the further increase in the performance of the scrubbing process.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN xml:lang=""EN"">RWE Power is investing a total of some €15 million in this development project. Germany’s Ministry of Economics and Technology is funding Phase 3 of the joint efforts undertaken by BASF, Linde and RWE with some € 2,5 million. The importance of this development project is stressed by the total funding of € 10 million.</SPAN></P><H4>CO<SUB>2</SUB> scrubbing for the next generation of lignite fired power plants</H4><P>The BoA 1 site at Niederaussem is ideally suited for the project for an additional reason. Linking the PCC pilot plant with BoA 1 provides the only opportunity in the world to test the <mark>CO2</mark> scrubbing process using dry lignite thanks to the raw lignite pre-drying prototype (WTA  technology) simultaneously operated at this unit. The coal predrying technique developed by RWE is a key technology for the next generation of lignite-based power plants, allowing the net efficiency of a power plant to be significantly increased. The CO<SUB>2</SUB> scrubbing technology can be precisely adjusted to the requirements of the next generation of highly flexible and highly efficient lignite-fired power plants with pre-drying technology.<SPAN xml:lang=""EN-GB""> Moreover, a high-performance desulphurization system (REAplus) is being operated in parallel with the CO<SUB>2</SUB> scrubbing pilot plant at the BoA 1 power plant in collaboration with our partner company Andritz. In an extended time test, flue gas from the REAplus system is conducted to the CO<SUB>2</SUB> scrubbing pilot plant. The REAplus technology is to help avoid the use of sodium hydroxide in the SO<SUB>2</SUB> fine scrubbing stage of a future commercial-scale CO<SUB>2</SUB> scrubbing process, thus lowering operating and investment cost.</SPAN></P></DIV><H3> </H3></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

According to an interview conducted by Dr. Oppenlander with Simon Stuart, PhD, chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission:</P><P>“Habitat loss from grazing livestock and feed crops is far and away the most pervasive threat to terrestrial animal species, impacting 86 percent of all mammals, 88 percent of amphibians, and 86 percent of all birds. One in every eight birds, one in every three amphibians, and one in every four mammals is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the near future. Overexploitation of wild animals for consumption remains a second major factor for extinction, such as can be seen in bushmeat trade in Africa and Southeast Asia and all hunting endeavors on land, globally.” </P><P>The Alliance for Global Conservation estimates 36 percent of all species on our planet are in danger of extinction.</P><P>Scientists have divided our planet into 825 terrestrial “ecoregions” (as well as 450 freshwater and a number of oceanic ecoregions), each defined by its own distinct set of animal and plant species, as well as <mark>climate</mark>. Of all these land ecoregions, almost half are reported by lead scientists (interviews/discussions) to have livestock as a current threat. The World Conservation Union reported in 2010 that “most of the world’s endangered or threatened species” on their Red List (which lists the species that are most endangered) are suffering habitat loss due to livestock—not due to agriculture but to livestock.</P><P>The Convention on Biological Diversity, held in Nagoya, Japan, in October 2010 agreed that none of their goals from 2002 for lessening the rate of biodiversity loss were met. The attendees confirmed that the main pressures for the rapid loss of species—habitat change, overexploitation, <mark>pollution</mark>, invasive species, and <mark>climate change</mark>—were all increasing in intensity.</P><P>Current biodiversity assessments (as presented by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the IUCN Red List, and the Global Environmental and Biodiversity Outlook) now generally agree that land use change, modification of river flow, freshwater <mark>pollution</mark>, and exploitation of marine environments are the most significant drivers of biodiversity change and loss of species. Because more than 50% of the land use changes on Earth are related to livestock (ILRI), 70 to 90% of freshwater <mark>pollution</mark> in western countries (particularly the U.S. and China) can be traced back to animal agriculture, minimally 14.5% of anthropogenic GHG emissions/<mark>climate change</mark>, and 100% of “exploitation of marine environments” is related to the global commercial fishing industry, it can be safely and confidently demonstrated that “the primary driver of global species’ extinctions and loss of biodiversity is animal agriculture.” </P><P> </P><P>[xx] The amount of water, land and fuel used for differing diets varies greatly from the types of foods consumed, amount consumed and the geographical region where the food was raised. Taking into consideration that 1lb of beef requires upwards of 2500 gallons of water to produce compared to only 25 gallons for 1lb of wheat, the water footprint of a person consuming a high meat diet could be 100x greater than that of a person consuming only plant foods. The same applies for land and oil use. Many arid areas of the world can not support 1 cow per 2 acres and require 50+ acre per cow, compared to a crops such as potatoes that can produce 50,000lbs+ per acre. The energy/fuel inputs are similar. 1 calorie of beef can take 27x more energy to produce than soybeans. </P><P>xxi (New) As of 2016 the estimates of wild horses and burros has increased on the range to 67,027 and the amount of wild horses and burros in holding fcailities is more than 45,000. However the BLM considers the amount of wild horses and burros on the range too populated and will attempt to remove 40,000 to bring the level back to what is considered by the BLM the 'acceptable level'</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html"" data-block-type=""2"" id=""block-yui_3_17_2_15_1414543521348_68760""><DIV class=""sqs-block-content""><P style=""text-align:center""> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Agriculture is an emissions-intensive sector; it accounted for less than 1 percent of U.S. production (in real gross value-added terms), but emitted 10 percent of U.S. GHGs in 2014. Energy-related CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission sources—which dominate GHG emissions in most other production sectors—are dwarfed in agriculture by unique crop and livestock emissions of nitrous oxide and methane. Crop and pasture soil management generates the most GHG emissions, due largely to the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers and other nutrients. Enteric fermentation (digestion in ruminant livestock) and manure management ranks second. Agriculture and forestry are unique in providing opportunities for withdrawing <mark>carbon</mark> from the atmosphere through biological sequestration in soil and biomass <mark>carbon</mark> sinks. The <mark>carbon</mark> sinks, which are largely due to land use change from agricultural to forest land (afforestation) and forest management on continuing forest, offset 11.5 percent of total U.S. GHG emissions in 2014 (see <A data-id=""15176"" href=""/topics/natural-resources-environment/<mark>climate</mark>-change/agricultural-production-and-mitigation/"" title=""Agricultural Production and Mitigation"">Agricultural Production and Mitigation</A>).</P><H3>The National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment</H3><P>The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) aims &quot;to assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.&quot; In this role, every four years it produces a National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment (NCA) that surveys and synthesizes the most recent science about <mark>climate change</mark> impacts and adaptation in the United States.

Any company’s set of relevant stakeholders in business, government and civil society will change with time; a clear picture is essential for effective engagement. Rather than relying on inflexible stakeholder mapping tools, it might be more appropriate to have skilled people and organizational structures in place for ongoing stakeholder analysis and engagement.</P><H2 class=""green""><STRONG>Why engage your stakeholders</STRONG></H2><P>How could you measure how hard a crisis has affected you (and likely your reputation) if you have not related with your stakeholders for years? How would you tally the number of upcoming, business-relevant issues you if you had not come across them through exchange with stakeholders? Engagement with stakeholders can help a company get a broader view of its market than economic figures alone can provide, improving its decision-making and performance. Stakeholders can give a company insight into their perspectives on current and emerging issues, into how they perceive the company and how they consider its impacts.</P><P>There are however, more reasons why stakeholder engagement is important: we face societal changes like the erosion of traditional opinion and decision-making mechanisms. Societies are more and more characterized by discourse and at the same time systemic challenges such as <mark>climate change</mark>, cultural disintegration or financial crises. Aren’t we beyond the point where a couple of countries can realize something like a Bretton Woods system within less than a month? Another example: The UN’s path to new <STRONG><A href=""/news_and_views/collaboration/hannah_furlong/unilever_pepsico_coca-cola_join_market_research_partners""><mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals</A></STRONG> in 2015 required an elaborated global process of multi-stakeholder consultations, academic input and intergovernmental negations.</P><P>There is growing evidence that it is simply not possible for a single institution or company to act on its own. The key to address this is to partner, consult, involve and engage with stakeholders. This does not mean delegating decision-making to external people; a company’s management should still decide on its business strategy. However, said strategy has a higher likeliness to succeed and meet the market’s needs if it is based on a participatory approach that also includes stakeholders’ views.

Water experts from BASF partnered with other representatives from industry, governments and NGOs to develop a standard that sets out the fundamental principles and criteria for <mark>sustainable</mark> water management. The result is the <STRONG>European Water Stewardship (EWS) Standard</STRONG>, which enables companies from various sectors as well as agricultural operations to examine how sustainably they use water resources. The EWS Standard includes 50 indicators, addressing the four principles of <mark>sustainable</mark> water abstraction, ensuring good water status, protection of high conservation areas and equitable water governance. The partnership with EWP highlights that a multi-stakeholder group can really achieve results beyond what is possible for a single institution. The EWS Standard is widely accepted and thus a real tool for improving water management across industries. BASF has itself set the <A href=""https://www.basf.com/en/company/sustainability/environment/water/water-stewardship.html"" target=""_blank"">goal</A> of introducing <mark>sustainable</mark> water management at its production sites in water-stressed areas by 2020 on the basis of the EWS Standard.</P><P>In Africa, BASF has established relationships with universities and science research organizations - for example, the <STRONG>Center for Scientific Industrial Research</STRONG> (CSIR) in South Africa. These are crucial in not only maintaining the company’s reputation and growing awareness of the brand in the region, but provide a mutual feedback and dialogue around various topics.</P><H2 class=""green""><STRONG>Keys for effective stakeholder engagement</STRONG></H2><P>In our experience, several factors contribute to successful stakeholder engagement:</P></LI><LI>Addressing relevant and pertinent issues at the right time</LI><LI>Identifying the relevant stakeholders and getting them to the table</LI><LI>Choosing the right form of engagement, based on the subject and stakeholders</LI><LI>Dedicating enough time and resources to thorough preparation</LI></UL><P>Internal preparation also needs to address the mindset of participating management. Interacting with some of the stakeholders may require managers to step out of their comfort zone and collaborate with unfamiliar individuals and organizations. Often resources in terms of time and research efforts are underestimated in this period but need to be invested.</P><P>When setting up and running any form of stakeholder engagement, we recommend being very clear and transparent regarding the rules of engagement. All parties should explicitly agree on the objectives, potential outcome and the way you want to interact: openly and with mutual respect. Although some engagement formats are short term, the majority of successful stakeholder interactions have a longer-term focus since building trust and reliable cooperation takes time.</P><P>Finally, a basic principle for successful stakeholder involvement is to invest in it before you need to rely on it.</P><H2 class=""green""><STRONG>The evolution of stakeholder engagement </STRONG></H2><P>Solid stakeholder relations helps a company to ensure its license <EM>to operate</EM>; it helps to mitigate risks, retain and win customers and employees, and build solid public relations.</P><P>Considering the growing complexity of the world we operate in - and the ‘communication revolution’ taking place thanks to social networks, big data – and with regard to a growing societal skepticism toward new technologies, we will talk about the license <EM>to innovate. </EM>This is especially crucial, as <mark>innovation</mark>s are key to providing solutions for the various challenges to ensure (more) <mark>sustainable</mark> development.</P><P>Also necessary to consider is the trend to operationalize and measure by metrics - be prepared for general discussions on the quantification of benefit of stakeholder engagement. But how do you measure success or impact on value?</P><P>There are various approaches to quantifying the value of stakeholder relations, but still there is no simple, ‘metric answer’ in sight – and, unfortunately, a simple answer might not be even helpful.
