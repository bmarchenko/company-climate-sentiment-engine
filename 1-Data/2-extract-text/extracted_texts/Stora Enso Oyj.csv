		  &quot;Three Australasian researchers have shown that natural forces are the dominant influence on <mark>climate</mark>, in a study just published in the highly-regarded Journal of Geophysical Research. According to this study little or none of the late 20th century global warming and cooling can be attributed to human activity. The close relationship between ENSO and global temperature, as described in the paper, leaves little room for any warming driven by human <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions. The available data indicate that future global temperatures will continue to change primarily in response to ENSO cycling, volcanic activity and solar changes.&quot; (<A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>depot.com/a/2117/PeerReviewed-Study-Rocks-<mark>Climate</mark>-Debate-Nature-not-man-responsible-for-recent-global-warminglittle-or-none-of-late-20th-century-warming-and-cooling-can-be-attributed-to-humans"" target=""_self""><mark>Climate</mark> Depot</A>)</P></DIV><P style=""text-align: justify;"">The paper claiming a link between global warming and the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)  is <A href=""http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2008JD011637.shtml"" target=""_self""><SPAN style=""color: #0046aa;"">Influence of the Southern Oscillation on tropospheric temperature (McLean 2009)</SPAN></A>.

They begin by comparing satellite measurements of tropospheric temperature to El Niño activity. Figure 1 plots a 12 month running average of Global Tropospheric Temperature Anomaly (GTTA, the light grey line) and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI, the black line).</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><EM>Figure 1: Twelve-month running means of SOI (dark line) and MSU GTTA (light line) for the period 1980 to 2006 with major periods of volcanic activity indicated (<A href=""http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2008JD011637.shtml"" target=""_self"">McLean 2009</A>).</EM></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">The Southern Oscillation Index shows no long term trend (hence the term Oscillation) while the temperature record shows a long term warming trend. Consequently, they find only a weak correlation between temperature and SOI. Next, they compare derivative values of SOI and GTTA. This is done by subtracting the 12 month running average from the same average 1 year later. They do this to &quot;remove the noise&quot; from the data. They fail to mention it also removes any linear trend, which is obvious from just a <A href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20100105151009/http://tamino.wordpress.com/2009/07/24/old-news/"">few steps of basic arithmetic</A>. It is also visually apparent when comparing the SOI derivative to the GTTA derivative in Figure 2:</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><EM>Figure 2: Derivatives of SOI (dark line) and MSU GTTA (light line) for the period 1981–2007 after removing periods of volcanic influence (<A href=""http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2008JD011637.shtml"" target=""_self"">McLean 2009</A>).</EM></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">The linear warming trend has been removed from the temperature record, resulting in a close correlation between the filtered temperature and SOI. The implications from this analysis should be readily apparent. El Niño has a strong short term effect on global temperature but cannot explain the long term trend. In fact, this is a point made repeatedly on this website (eg - <A href=""https://skepticalscience.com/What-causes-short-term-changes-in-ocean-heat.html"" target=""_self"">here</A> and <A href=""https://skepticalscience.com/Global-cooling-the-new-kid-on-the-block.html"" target=""_self"">here</A>).</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">This view is confirmed in other analyses. An examination of the temperature record from 1880 to 2007 finds internal variability such as El Nino has relatively small impact on the long term trend (<A href=""http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2008/2008GL035984.shtml"" target=""_self"">Hoerling 2008</A>). Instead, they find long term trends in sea surface temperatures are driven predominantly by the planet's energy imbalance.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">There have been various attempts to filter out the ENSO signal from the temperature record.

Similarly, <A href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7195/abs/nature06982.html"" target=""_self"">Thompson 2008</A> filters out the ENSO signal from the temperature record.

The goal of this project is to develop the sawmill industry significantly via digitalisation. One of the main objectives is to build an information system connecting all the production steps of the mill so that it is possible to track the life cycle of raw material from the beginning to the end product. Raw material and its characteristics become individually traceable (e.g., logs and their parts) in the real-time industrial environment. This makes the use of raw material more efficient. At the same time, resource-efficient processes become more <mark>sustainable</mark> which benefits conservation of nature, especially in controlling the <mark>climate change</mark>.  
</P><P>
Modern sensor systems, new computational methods, and more robust mathematical models enable developing novel machine vision based measurements for quality control systems. The capabilities of the systems can be extended by using measured information from the sawmill processes and raw material. The obtained quality information can be connected via feedback loops to sorting the logs and optimizing the sawing processes. The developed <mark>innovation</mark>s will be tested in the real industrial environment.

While an El Nino is a naturally occurring phenomenon, <mark>climate change</mark> is a man-made - some argue irreversible - trend created mostly via the emissions of greenhouse gases. </P><P>Every three to seven years, the surface waters of the tropical Southern Pacific ocean either warm or cool by 1 to 3 degrees Celsius, creating weather conditions that are often the exact opposite of the norm.</P><P><SPAN>The El Nino Southern Oscillation, known as ENSO, is when the surface waters experience the warming.

This phenomenon has been taking place even as far back as 10,000 years ago, during the Holocene period (Outavas et al. 2006). However, the El Nino didn’t receive much public attention until 1997-98 when Peru and Ecuador experienced heavy floods, Indonesia and Australia faced ghastly droughts and Southeast Asia had to shut down some of their airports due to the thick clouds of smoke arising from forest fires in the region.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">In Spanish, ‘El Nino’ directly translates to ‘Christ Child’. The seasonal arrival of warm water in the Pacific Ocean during the month of December prompted the South American fishermen to call it El Nino. El Nino and La Nina (‘Little Girl’) are opposite phases of the ENSO cycle which describes the variations in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the Equatorial Pacific. El Nino is the warm phase while La Nina is the cold phase of the ENSO.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""fws_5b0274cbc22f9"" data-midnight=""dark"" data-bg-mobile-hidden="""" class=""wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row standard_section   "" style=""padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; ""><DIV class=""col span_12 dark left""><DIV class=""vc_col-sm-12 wpb_column column_container col no-extra-padding"" data-bg-cover="""" data-padding-pos=""all"" data-has-bg-color=""false"" data-bg-color="""" data-bg-opacity=""1"" data-hover-bg="""" data-hover-bg-opacity=""1"" data-animation="""" data-delay=""0""><DIV class=""wpb_wrapper""><DIV class=""wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ""><DIV class=""wpb_wrapper""><P style=""text-align: justify;"">An upwelling or upward movement of ocean water can mix upper levels of seawater with lower levels bringing cool and nutrient rich water from the bottom of the ocean to the warmer surface where it supports large populations of phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish and fish eating seabirds. Every few years normal upwelling in the Pacific Ocean is affected by ENSO. During an ENSO prevailing winds called trade winds blowing east to west weaken (reverse direction). This allows warmer waters of the western Pacific to move towards the Western coast of South America which suppresses the normal upwellings of cold nutrient rich water.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">This leads to a disruption of the marine food chain. Warm waters send fish to cold deep water. Seals are left to suffer as they’re deprived of their food source.

It includes changes in the atmospheric temperature, precipitation and wind patterns. One of the contributing factors to <mark>climate change</mark> is global warming. This ongoing increase in the average global temperature at the earth’s surface is caused by an increase in the amount of greenhouse gases, such as <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>), in the atmosphere.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">A rise in global temperatures leads to an increase in sea surface temperatures thereby facilitating the El Nino phenomenon. The relationship between El Nino and <mark>climate change</mark> is somewhat cyclic. Oceans act as <mark>carbon</mark> sinks; that is, they capture and store <mark>carbon</mark> as dissolved CO<SUB>2</SUB>. CO<SUB>2 </SUB>dissolves more readily in colder waters.

A new box for shipping fresh fish has hit the market

</H1><P><B>EPS has traditionally been used for food packaging because of its good insulation qualities. But the plastic tends to end up in our seas. That is about to change as Stora Enso’s new EcoFishBoxTM hits the market. </B></P><P>Every year, large amounts of plastic waste, from materials such as EPS, end up in the world’s seas and lakes. Studies show that residues from this waste are present in the internal organs of saltwater fish and other species. </P><P>Not anymore. The new EcoFishBoxTM from Stora Enso is set to revolutionise the way in which fresh fish is packaged. The new corrugated board box is 100% recyclable and takes up seven times less space than a conventional Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) box. A state-of-the-art laminate liner solution from Walki provides an effective barrier to moisture, water and fat.</P><P class=""image__info"">Stora Enso partners with Walki to develop new eco-packaging solution for fish</P><H2>
Replacing the plastic fish box

</H2><P>Finnish pulp and paper giant Stora Enso has decades-long experience of developing all manner of corrugated board packaging. Its latest <mark>innovation</mark> is a new version of its established waterproof, leak-tight corrugated board solution that has now been adapted for the fish industry. The EcoFishBoxTM is made of materials approved for food contact, and complies with the hygiene standards for food packaging. </P><P>“Traditionally, EPS has been the packaging solution of choice for fish – because it’s light, with good insulation qualities,&quot; explains <B>Vesa Penttinen</B>, Sales Development Manager, Stora Enso Packaging Solutions. “However, the recycling process for this fossil-based packaging material is not comprehensive and it poses a serious threat to the environment.&quot;And in talks with customers, Stora Enso found out that in addition to the environmental problems, the productivity of the fish packaging process also needed to improve.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>“This new product will not only reduce packaging costs but also facilitate a huge leap in productivity,&quot; says Penttinen.
	</BLOCKQUOTE><H2>
A recyclable packaging solution

</H2><P>Stora Enso’s virgin fibre corrugated board packages are made of renewable Nordic wood fibre. Corrugated board packaging is fully recyclable, and the recycling rates are among the highest in the world. In Finland, 99% of all collected corrugated board material is recycled. </P><P>Furthermore, corrugated packaging offers savings of up to 60% when it comes to waste handling, transport and recycling costs. In comparison with an EcoFishBoxTM, which is delivered as a flat corrugated board sheet, a traditional EPS box takes up seven times as much space in storage and during transport.</P><P>“It’s reasonable to assume that seven times less space means seven times fewer trucks on the road and seven times less <mark>pollution</mark>,&quot; says <B>Jan-Anders Fagerhed</B>, Sales Manager at Walki.</P><H2>
Insulated box for shipping fish

</H2><P>The EcoFishBoxTM is not only better for the environment – tests have also shown that it offers good insulation for fish logistics. Its outstanding waterproof, moisture-proof and fat-proof properties are the result of two fibre-based barrier liner solutions provided by Walki. The outside liner is a Walki-Line Aqua PE-laminate, while the inside liner is a Walki-Line Ultra PET-laminate.</P><P>“Each liner has a thin polymer layer that provides an effective barrier against contaminants like water and moisture and leaking agents like fat,&quot; says Fagerhed. “The combination of the two liners makes the box waterproof, and fat proof on the inside.&quot;Another advantage of corrugated board boxes is good printability. Company logos, images and other information can be printed directly on the corrugated board material in up to five colours, giving the packaging a more premium appearance.The EcoFishBox™ was announced as one of the winners of the Scanstar Nordic packaging competition and the World Star Packaging competition in 2017. </P><H3>More stories</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The event gathered together over 200 representatives from companies, organizations and universities, as well as policymakers and experts. Their mission of the day was to discuss about the business opportunities provided by <mark>sustainable</mark> development and how to speed up entering into new markets on a global level.</P><P>The program of the day consisted of key note speeches, thematic panel discussions and presentations of business cases, where companies have done <mark>innovation</mark>s towards SDGs. This following text summarizes the main topics and discussions of the interesting day.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>The Global Challenge: There is No Planet B<SPAN style=""color: #800080;"">Mari Pantsar</SPAN></STRONG>, Director, Resource-wise and <mark>Carbon</mark>-neutral Society, Finnish <mark>Innovation</mark> Fund Sitra</P><P>Director Mari Pantsar from the Finnish <mark>Innovation</mark> Fund Sitra opened the day with an important kickstart and a valuable reminder: we only have one planet. Even if the global population has been expected to grow into 9 billion in 2050, <mark>climate change</mark> and scarcity of resources set limitations for economic growth, societies, and in the end for the whole Earth.</P><P>Instead of speaking about <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, we should talk about <mark>carbon</mark> handprint. We should find new, <mark>sustainable</mark> ways to create economic growth – by changing energy production and use of natural resources change into a <mark>carbon</mark>-neutral economy. The challenges are global but so are markets: by providing solutions to the largest problems in the world countries, such as Finland, can be successful and at the same time lead the way for others in the path of <mark>sustainable</mark> development. It is not only the right thing to do but also profitable – and above all a must – we have no planet B.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Making the <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals Your Business: The Why and How<SPAN style=""color: #800080;"">Kai Mykkänen</SPAN></STRONG>, Minister for Foreign Trade and Development, Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland</P><P>Renewable resources on the Earth are limited and the demand multiplies day by day. Minister for Foreign Trade and Development, Kai Mykkänen compared investing into clean energy to a home insurance. You never know when the catastrophes happen but you still secure your home. He emphasized the active participation of private sector in producing new <mark>innovation</mark>s to achieve SDG goals. To create new business models, we also need long-term goals and funding for <mark>sustainable</mark> business. It is well recognized why we need green growth and we also have the solutions. Isn’t the choice obvious then? Does your company want to stay in the forefrot of development or stick into 10 % who stay with the old technology?</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Global Markets in Transition: Trends and Business Opportunities Created by the <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals<SPAN style=""color: #800080;"">Nikolaj Gilbert</SPAN></STRONG>, Director, Partnerships, Communications and Partnerships Group, UNOPS</P><P>Developing markets show huge potential for export companies and new <mark>innovation</mark>s. Ethiopia, for example, has grown with speed in the recent years and the continental has the youngest population in the world, who can be companies’ future customers. The expertise of private sector is crucial in exporting new products and services, which can at the same time solve global challenges. ”Finland can be in the forefront to turn risks in to opportunities, especially with partnerships. There are only a few as inspiring places as Finland”, cheered Director of Partnerships, Communications and Partnerships Group Nikolaj Gilbert from UNOPS.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Panel discussion - Theme 1: Business <mark>innovation</mark>s and market opportunities created by <mark>sustainable</mark> development</STRONG> </P><P>When it comes to new market opportunities, the role of exchanging insights with consumers and making customers’ wishes a number one priority was a crucial element. In Finland, there is a strong network of different societal actors, which creates an excellent platform for new trials and applications in new markets. However, committing experts in local conditions is also important for success.</P><P>Success stories of three Finnish companies in developing markets brought the discussion concretely into life. CEO Vesa Korhonen told how <SPAN style=""color: #800080;""><STRONG><A href=""http://nocart.com"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #800080;"">Nocart’s</A></STRONG></SPAN>electricity production systems, such as hydro or solar -powered plants, have created possibilities to study for children in Africa and Southeast Asia (SDG 7 Affordable and clean energy). It also sold a complete biogas plant to Africa, which turns cows’ dung into electricity.</P><P>The economic consequences caused by weather phenomena and catastrophes have increased rapidly during the past 20 years. Especially developing countries are vulnerable for changes in weather. Director of Meteorology Panu Partanen from <STRONG><SPAN style=""color: #800080;""><A href=""http://www.vaisala.com/en/Pages/default.aspx?_ga=1.11474612.1478301230.1471848796"" class=""wf_file"" style=""color: #800080;""><SPAN class=""wf_file_text"">Vaisala</SPAN></A></SPAN></STRONG> told that the company has done significant work for developing new weather observations systems (SDG 13 <mark>Climate</mark> action). In countries such as Vietnam, where the accuracy of meteorological observations has improved and moderated the negative consequences of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P><SPAN style=""color: #800080;""><STRONG><A href=""http://www.honkajokioy.fi/eng"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #800080;"">Honkajoki Oy</A></STRONG></SPAN> is a recycling facility, which returns animal-based slaughter by-products back to nature as fertilizers, animal feed and raw material for energy production (SDG 2 Zero hunger). The model, based on circular economy, is being developed for countries where access to energy, waste treatment and clean water are huge challenges. ”Being active and present locally is a must to see new ways to create business. What works here in Finland, doesn’t necessarily work elsewhere”, told Business Development Manager Reetta Nevala.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Panel discussion - Theme 2: How to accelerate <mark>sustainable</mark> development and market entries with partnerships and co-operation?</STRONG></P><P>The knowledge of the local culture cannot be underestimated: the interest and activity of company is seen in creating partnerships. The goals need to be clarified for both participants, when the partnerships should be chosen to serve both parties’ needs. Finding a suitable partner can be challenging, when organizations, research institutions and companies of different sizes can be in their own boxes. The strength of partnerships is influenced by many factors, such as societal factors (education, financial opportunities, politics) as well as individual and geographical elements.</P><P>Local knowledge, shared values and clarity of goals are good starting points for actions in spite of possible language barriers. When partnerships are reciprocal and have invesments from both sides, the results can be really successful. Senior Specialist Mika Välitalo from <STRONG><SPAN style=""color: #800080;""><A href=""https://plan.fi/en"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #800080;"">Plan International Finland</A></SPAN></STRONG> presented an <mark>innovation</mark> born from collaboration of a company and an organization.

A three-year project ”Water Stewardship – Shared Value Creation” is executed in collaboration with local villagers, NGOs and another Finnish company Stora Enso, which has knowledge from tree plantation management. In the village of Baimei, the quality of water has already improved and there are plans to build a second well to give enough water for farming.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Panel discussion - Theme 3: How the SDGs influence investments and financial markets?</STRONG></P><P>The representative of FINSIF (Finland’s <mark>Sustainable</mark> Investment Forum), Head of Manager Selection at eQ <SPAN style=""color: #800080;""><STRONG>Esa Saloranta</STRONG></SPAN> noted, that responsible investment has became more mainstream, and there are no barriers that the investments couldn’t be directed into SDGs. At the moment weak infrastructure and unstable conditions in developing markets are factors that create uncertainty and prevent investments. Consumers’ interest in <mark>carbon</mark>-neutral products has grown, which also makes the investors more interested in the effects of their investment targets.</P><P>At the moment green bond signalizes the strategic direction of the company, however it may also be interpreted as greenwashing. What is green now, may not be green anymore in the future. Impact investing is a way to direct private capital into projects that pursue positive and measurable societal impacts. Advisor Heidi Humala from Finnish <mark>Innovation</mark> Fund (Sitra) noted that even if there is capital for impact investing, the choice of targets is considered challenging, as well as the measurement of the impacts.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>How to move forward?<SPAN style=""color: #800080;"">Sari Siitonen</SPAN> - </STRONG>Director of <mark>Sustainable</mark> Business, Confederation of Finnish Industries</P><P>In the conclusive speech of the event, the Director of <mark>Sustainable</mark> Business at the Confederation of Finnish Industries Sari Siitonen encouraged Finland to focus on increasing its <mark>carbon</mark> handprint i.e. offer know-how to combat <mark>climate change</mark> globally. Finland has a lot to offer in this respect.</P><P>There are over 3000 companies in Finland that offer clean technologies and solutions. Entering global markets requires knowledge on each countries’ circumstances, expectations and needs of local customers. Companies do not need to go at it alone. Valuable partners can be found in startups and cities. Also the Team Finland network exists to aid companies in gaining ground at foreign markets, when investors and financiers are increasingly interested in new, agile <mark>sustainable</mark> solutions.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Further of the event and what FIBS has to provide related to <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals you can ask from Helena Kekki, tel. +358 50 3451 966, helena.kekki(at)fibsry.fi</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""footer-outer""><DIV id=""footer-sub""><DIV id=""footer""><DIV class=""custom-footer""><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

An El Niño has been wreaking havoc around the world, causing major flooding in South America, droughts in Indonesia and southern Africa, an unprecedented hurricane season in the North Pacific last fall, and much more.
Climatologists are still calculating whether this is the biggest El Niño on record. What they do agree on is that there have now been three “super-El Niños” in the space of just over three decades — in 1982-83, 1997-98, and now 2015-16. This unusual recurrence gives weight to a forecast made by Wenju Cai of Australia’s national science agency, CSIRO, two years ago that headline-grabbing “super El Niños” were in the process of upgrading from once every 20 years to once every ten years.</P><DIV class=""imageleft""><DIV class=""credit"">This town in Entre Rios Province, Argentina, was flooded after El Niño-related rains in December.

Eventually, there is a breakout. The warm waters turn and wash back east toward the Americas. They take the weather with them, bringing downpours to some normally arid sections of the western coasts of both North and South America, while leaving normally wet Indonesia dry and fire-prone.</P><P>Meanwhile knock-on effects from this climatic and oceanic convulsion spread around the world, impacting every continent with floods or droughts, heat waves or cold snaps.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>Most models predict the chances of routine El Niños turning into extreme events is growing.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>These breakouts, of greater or lesser extent, are a regular feature of the planet. They typically happen every three to six years and last for up to a year. They are often followed by an exaggerated version of normal conditions, known as La Niña, which typically brings heavy rains over Indonesia, floods in southern Africa, tropical cyclones that blast the Chinese coast, hurricanes in the Atlantic, and dry conditions on the Pacific coast of the Americas. </P><P>Cai’s study, using 20 <mark>climate</mark> models from different research institutions that simulate Pacific Ocean conditions with and without <mark>climate change</mark>, found that this rhythm of normal El Niño cycles is unlikely to change as the world warms. But most of the models predict that the chances of routine El Niños turning into extreme events — super El Niños — is growing strongly, with the likelihood of extremes expected to double.</P><P>Cai explains why: Big El Niños happen when the warm waters from the western Pacific push most strongly eastward. And <mark>climate change</mark> is making that easier, because temperatures in the normally cool waters along the western coasts of North and South America are rising faster than those in other parts of the oceans. So the extra heat from the west can spread further, which loads the dice in favor of major El Niño events.</P><P>Not everyone agrees with this conclusion. Skeptics such as Kevin Trenberth at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, point out that <mark>climate</mark> models may be good at simulating ocean temperatures, but forecasting what might happen to the El Niño effect is far more difficult. When <mark>climate</mark> modelers feed ocean temperature data from past El Niños into supercomputers, they are none too good at predicting the occurrence of those prior El Niños.And even models that predict more big El Niños disagree about where exactly we are headed. Some project that global warming could ultimately drag the world into near permanent El-Niño conditions. But last year an analysis of 12 million years of temperature changes in the Pacific found no evidence of past permanent El Niños, even during times much warmer than today. “Global warming does not drive the Pacific Ocean into a permanent El Niño-like condition,” concluded author Mark Pagani, a Yale University paleoclimatologist.</P><P>But Cai, in addition to predicting that the intensity of El Niños could increase, also forecast in a paper last year that La Niñas could grow in intensity, too, with a “near-doubling in the frequency of future extreme La Niña events.”</P><BLOCKQUOTE>El Niño is delivering disruptions that could intensify as the world continues to warm.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>While <mark>climate change</mark> appears to make big El Niños more frequent, it is also true that El Niños return the favor by giving a short-term stimulus to atmospheric global warming. This is because the spread of warm waters across the tropical Pacific results in a release of heat energy from the oceans into the atmosphere.</P><P>The last big El Niño, in 1998, set global temperature records that lasted for several years. In fact its impact was so marked that in the aftermath of that spike in temperatures, many concluded that global warming had somehow “stalled” because temperatures fell briefly from those heights.</P><P>That was wide of the mark, however. The underlying temperature trend continued to carry on up. There have been a series of record global average temperatures since 2005. And when the next big El Niño erupted, it ensured that 2015 became easily the warmest year yet. Many expect there will be enough extra warmth still coursing around the world to deliver a new record in 2016.</P><P>But while climatologists are watching global averages, for most people it is the day-to-day weather that matters. And El Niño is certainly delivering some startling events — disruptions that could intensify as the world continues to warm.</P><P>The drought it has created in Indonesia has sustained the worst forest and peatland fires there since 1998. Equally dramatic have been floods in Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, and southern Brazil that displaced some 150,000 people in December. The current El Niño is also responsible for the big rains and snowfall in California that have at least temporarily eased the drought there.</P><DIV class=""imageleft""><DIV class=""credit"">El Niño-related drought has devastated parts of southern Africa, including this area in southwest Zimbabwe. ZINIYANGE AUNTONY/AFP/GETTY IMAGES </DIV></DIV><P>Spreading its influence across the Indian Ocean, El Niño is also responsible for an escalating drought in southern Africa that could result in famine later in the year, scientists say. And it is being blamed for everything from the accelerated melting of tropical glaciers in the Andes in recent months to the bleaching of overheated coral reefs from Florida to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef.</P><P>It was also one element behind the unusually warm temperatures in the tropical Atlantic that triggered Hurricane Alex, the first hurricane to form in the North Atlantic in January since 1938, along with East Coast blizzards and record December rainfall and high temperatures on the other side of the Atlantic in the U.K.</P><P>Less noticed, there was also an unprecedented hurricane season in the North Pacific in the late fall, stretching into January, when Tropical Storm Pali became the earliest new-year storm ever recorded. Add in a record heat wave in India, bush fires in Australia, and the coldest weather in decades in parts of China, and the disruption around the world in the past three months, when El Niño was at its most intense, has been immense.</P><P>Some scientists are even attributing recent disease outbreaks, in part, to the current El Niño. But these claims look less justified. For instance, several new reports have linked El Niño to the growing outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease zika in South America. The suggestion is that it has created the high temperatures and standing water that mosquitoes flourish in.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>The current El Niño has been, by some measures, a record — bigger than 1982 or 1998.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>El Niño has indeed made much of the continent a little warmer than normal. But the Zika outbreak is in northeastern Brazil, some 1,800 miles north of the recently flooded region of the continent. In classic El Niño fashion, northeastern Brazil has been unusually dry in recent months. So, despite claims that the proliferation of water containers set up by people fearing drought might attract the insects, the suggestion appears, on the face of it, to be based on bad geography.</P><P>Long-term weather-watchers had been on tenterhooks for an El Niño for a while. There had been several false alarms, says Steve Zebiak of Columbia University’s Earth Institute, one of the first researchers to attempt El Niño forecasts. “In early 2014, we had a definite warming that looked like an onset, but which fizzled out in mid-year,” he says. When identical things happened early in 2015, many predicted another dud. Wrong again. Instead, the warming built and spread.</P><P>“I haven’t seen a convincing explanation of why 2015 was different from 2014,” says Zebiak. But his hunch is that the difference may have been the unwinding of another long-term cycle in atmospheric-oceanic interactions in the Pacific, known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which operates on longer timescales than El Niño and is centered in middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.</P><P>Whatever the trigger, the current El Niño has been, by some measures at least, a record — bigger than 1982 or 1998. Certainly neither of its rivals exceeded the 3.1 degrees Celsius of warming recorded in the central Pacific in December. But the heat is starting to dissipate now. El Niño may be gone by early summer, its final goodbye heralding a delay in the return of offshore winds that bring the monsoon season to India, meteorologists predict.</P><P>What’s next? Nothing is certain. But some smart money is on a big La Niña being underway by late 2016, as the warm waters rush back west. Cai’s studies forecast that in future the greatest risk of extreme La Niñas “occurs in the year following an extreme El Niño, thus projecting more frequent dramatic swings of opposite extremes from one year to the next.”</P><P>If it happens, we can expect drought turning to floods in Africa, a resurgence of tropical cyclones, the U.S. Southwest locked back into its long-term drought, and probably much else. Unless you enjoy wild weather, the prognosis from here on out does not look good.</P></DIV></SECTION></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Photo: NOAA/Stuart Rankin</P></DIV><P>The United Nations has declared 2015 the hottest year since record keeping began. It was also a year marked by the occurrence of a “super” El Niño. El Niño is a phenomenon that disrupts normal weather patterns, bringing heavy rains and drought to different parts of the world. Are the warming temperatures and El Niño connected?</P><P>Most scientists agree that the warming trend (2011 to 2015 is the hottest five-year period ever.) is due to greenhouse gases humans have put into the atmosphere. But 2015’s warming of .9˚C above the average for the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century was the “largest margin by which the annual global temperature record has been broken” according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, because of the presence of a strong El Niño.</P><P><A href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPA-KpldDVc-fuels"">El Niño</A> is a complex and naturally occurring weather pattern that results when ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean near the equator vary from the norm. The phenomenon typically occurs every two to seven years. The 2015-2016 El Niño, however, is being called a “super” El Niño, the worst in 15 years. The two previous super El Niños occurred in 1982-1983 and 1997-1998.</P><P>Normally­—that is, in years when El Niño does not occur—strong trade winds blow from east to west across the Pacific Ocean around the equator. The winds push warm surface ocean water from South America west towards Asia and Australia, and cold water wells up from below in the east to take its place along South America. This creates a temperature disparity across the Pacific, which also keeps the trade winds blowing (the temperature difference and the trade winds reinforce each other). The accumulation of warm water in the west adds heat to the air, causing it to rise and create unstable weather, which is why the western Pacific region is warm and rainy. Cool, drier air is usually found on the eastern side of the Pacific.</P><P>In an El Niño year, the trade winds weaken or break down. The warm water that is normally pushed towards the western Pacific washes back across, piling up on the east side of the Pacific from California to Chile, causing rain and storms.</P><P>Although El Niño’s strongest impacts are felt around the equatorial Pacific, they can affect weather around the world by influencing high and low pressure systems, winds and precipitation. And as the warmer ocean waters release excess energy (heat) into the atmosphere, global temperatures rise.</P><P>Often, a year after an El Niño, the pendulum swings back and La Niña occurs, which is an intensification of the normal pattern. The trade winds blow harder from east to west, and more cold water wells up on the east and moves west, resulting in weather patterns that are the reverse of El Niño. The western Pacific is rainier and flooding can be severe if following El Niño-induced droughts; northern Australia often experiences more cyclones. Cooler temperatures and less rainfall occur along the coast of South America. Together, the cycling of El Niño and La Niña is called El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO).</P><P>The changing weather patterns can having damaging impacts on agriculture, fisheries, ecosystems, health, energy demand and air quality, and increase the risks of wildfires around the globe.</P><DIV id=""attachment_55367"" style=""max-width: 303px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Fighting wildfires in Indonesia.</P></DIV><P>Sea surface temperatures usually peak around December (The phenomenon was called El Niño, Christ Child in Spanish, because of the time of year it generally occurs.), but bigger impacts are often felt a few months later as global oceans gradually heat up. This year’s El Niño will likely last through March and could persist until May. It has already increased temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific up to 2.78˚C higher than normal. So far, typhoons in the Pacific, wildfires in Indonesia, heavy rains and floods in southeastern India, and flooding of the Mississippi River have been attributed to El Niño.</P><DIV id=""attachment_55368"" style=""max-width: 303px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Flooding in Chennai, India</P></DIV><P>The Earth Institute’s <A href=""http://iri.columbia.edu"">International Research Institute for <mark>Climate</mark> and Society</A> forecasts that spring will likely bring drier conditions over northern South America, southern and central Africa, southeast Asia, western Canada, western Alaska, the northern U.S., western Africa, southern India and Sri Lanka. The U.S. South, northern Caribbean, coastal Ecuador and Peru, southern Brazil and eastern Paraguay will likely experience increased precipitation.</P><P>Even without El Niño, 2015 would have been a record warm year, but <mark>climate</mark> scientists believe El Niño was responsible for 8 percent to 10 percent of the warming. Gavin Schmidt, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, estimated that El Niño accounted for 0.07˚C of the above average warming that occurred in 2015. Adam Scaife, head of long-range prediction at the U.K.’s Meteorological Office, expects that El Niño will contribute 25 percent of new record global temperatures in 2016.</P><DIV id=""attachment_55369"" style=""max-width: 303px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">2015, the warmest year. Photo: NASA</P></DIV><P>Scientists know that El Niño contributes to an increase in global temperatures. But do rising global and ocean temperatures, in turn, intensify El Niño?</P><P>The science here is as yet inconclusive. One <A href=""http://www.nature.com/n<mark>climate</mark>/journal/v4/n2/full/n<mark>climate</mark>2100.html"">2014 study </A>suggests that super El Niño events could double in the future due to <mark>climate change</mark>. Using 20 <mark>climate</mark> models to examine possible changes in El Niño over the next 100 years, the scientists projected that extreme El Niño events could occur roughly every 10 years instead of every 20.</P><P>Lisa Goddard, director of the International Research Institute for <mark>Climate</mark> and Society, finds the study interesting, but questions its conclusions because observational evidence of El Niño only goes back a few decades, whereas scientists know that there is a great deal of natural variation in El Niño events over long periods of time. Moreover, said Goddard, “The models have limitations in their representation of El Niño and its variability.”</P><P>Other <mark>climate</mark> models differ in their assessment of future El Niño events. Some suggest the ENSO cycle will become more intense, others say it will weaken, and some find there will be little change. According to Schmidt, “There is a very large variation in ENSO statistics (frequency/magnitude) over time, and so detecting a shift due to <mark>climate change</mark> is very challenging. Models as a whole are all over the shop, and so it doesn’t fill one with great confidence.”</P><P>A <A href=""http://www.nature.com/articles/n<mark>climate</mark>2915.epdf?referrer_access_token=8SznqZ834K3wu2IcVDhhlNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0O52T_z3xdIZTeJhjUyMTWREQtgEo_1gP3K5ezHJr6e6d9v4hD0rDYlp7TW72Lwdes-EA_3ms6iOmza4WNC0VAODs6vPgdNiYCxi5iint2Xf_Cs2GNJUkw9Cf8XAYzUBMzMYiCgE8SZuuS-0vjJaiu7EjYhQVHxMhdwvEnXVkHGEJZYJ0gu127BIusUW95mmhnxw3-1RyayiTSL1jb01UEa&amp;tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com"">recent report </A>studying the amount of heat the ocean has absorbed since 1865 found that nearly half of the industrial era increases in ocean warming occurred in the past 20 years, with over a third of that heat being accumulated below 700 meters. Twenty years ago, the deep ocean contained just 20 percent of the extra heat from greenhouse gas emissions. This finding actually has to do with La Niña rather than El Niño, explained Goddard. La Niña generates stronger trade winds, so the sea surface gets colder, drawing more energy (heat) out of the atmosphere. As the warm water accumulates in the western Pacific, it pushes large amounts of warm upper ocean water down deeper than usual, where the heat is stored.</P><P>There is an ongoing variable but steady increase in ocean heat content, but no one yet knows how that might affect El Niño.</P><P>“We have to think <mark>climate change</mark> will influence El Niño in some way and will impact its impacts,” said Goddard. “But how El Niño events themselves change because of global warming? It’s hard to say, and harder to observe because there is so much variation in El Niño by itself from decade to decade. It’s a tough question to answer.”</P><DIV id=""attachment_55370"" style=""max-width: 303px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">An early start to the West Pacific typhoon season in 2015 due to El Nino.</P></DIV><P>Scientists are working on it, however. One of the World <mark>Climate</mark> Research Programme’s CLIVAR (<mark>Climate</mark> and Ocean: Variability, Predictability and Change) projects is bringing together scientists from around the world to study <A href=""http://www.clivar.org/research-foci/enso"">“ENSO in a Changing <mark>Climate</mark>.” </A> CLIVAR says that it has not been possible to determine how ENSO will be affected by changes in coming decades because there has not been long and comprehensive enough observation of ENSO phenomena, and because the ability of computers to model the complex interplay of the many ocean and atmospheric processes involved in ENSO is limited. The project’s goal is to better understand how different physical processes influence ENSO and the variability of El Niño events over decades.</P><P>This research is critical, because future El Niño events will unfold against the background of global warming. Michael Jarraud, former secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, warned that El Niño could be “playing out in uncharted territory.” “This naturally occurring El Niño event and human induced <mark>climate change</mark> may interact and modify each other in ways we have never before experienced,” said Jarraud.</P><P> </P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In Simo post-glacial rebound park, the continuously rising land causes the sea to retreat further from the continent.  Every year the land surface in the park area increases the size of a house lot, shipping routes are becoming shallower and new islands are formed all the time.  Information plaques and maps in the park will help you see the signs of post-glacial rebound and the changes the landscape has gone through during the past few centuries.  Learn more about post-glacial rebound! In Scandinavia, land is rising as a result of the ice age. The last ice age, called &quot;Veiksel&quot;, covered Scandinavia and part of Europe with a thick glacier. The glacier covering Scandinavia was 1,000–3,700 metres thick,  and it pressed the 60-metre thick continental plate underneath it into a dent.  In the park area the pressure of the ice against the crust of the earth was approx. 3000 tons per square kilometre.  The depth of the dent caused by the glacier varied from tens to hundreds of metres. In the area of the park the dent was about 900–1000 metres deep. During the past 10,000 years the dent has started to straighten out, which can be seen in the seashore moving further from the continent.  Simo post-glacial rebound park has 10 information points where you can learn about how the shoreline has moved during the last 500 years.  Because the land rebound is strongest in the Bothnian Bay area, changes in the shore landscape are also very clear here.  The oldest residents in the area can remember when the seashore used to be closer to habitation and boat harbours closer to houses.  Change is slow, but the sea level has gone down by almost a metre during the lifetime of the area's oldest inhabitants. Today there are still places where glaciers are pressing the earth's crust in this way.  For example, the current situation in the Antarctic and Greenland are similar to that in Scandinavia 15,000 years ago.  In Greenland the thickness of the glacier in the middle of the island is over 3 km, and it has pressed the earth's crust underneath it below the sea level. </SPAN><P style=""text-align:center;""><SPAN style=""font:12px ArialMS; "">Fennovoima Oy</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Predicting the behavior of the El Niño weather cycle is a challenge for forecasters and <mark>climate</mark> scientists, and the stakes are high.</P><P>
El Niño and its counterpart La Niña, driven by changes in sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, can have major effects on weather conditions hundreds and thousands of miles away. Studies have linked catastrophic floods, droughts, disease outbreaks, wildfires and even social unrest to the weather cycle, known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.</P><P>
Yet scientists have struggled to understand whether <mark>climate change</mark> is altering that cycle. <mark>Climate</mark> models have produced conflicting results, and reliable instrumental records of ENSO events begin in the early 20th century.</P><P>
Now a new study, which builds on prior efforts to reconstruct El Niño's past behavior by examining coral growth, suggests that El Niño and La Niña events have become more variable and intense over the past several decades.</P><P>&quot;We kind of answered the question, is El Niño changing with respect to recent natural variability?&quot; said Kim Cobb, the Georgia Institute of Technology <mark>climate</mark> scientist who led the research published yesterday in the journal <EM>Science</EM>. &quot;The answer is yes, tentatively so.&quot;</P><P>
The 7,000-year portrait painted by the corals she examined suggests El Niño may get stronger as the level of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere climbs, Cobb said.</P><P>
But researchers will need to do more work -- including a concerted effort to fill gaps in the record of El Niño's past behavior -- to prove that connection, for now a tentative one, she said.</P><P>&quot;It could be thrown out,&quot; Cobb said. &quot;But whatever the result, we will have confidence with more data.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Coral cores tell the story</STRONG>
The new analysis is based on samples that Cobb describes as a data &quot;down payment,&quot; tripling the amount of coral-core data available from the past 7,000 years.</P><P>
Cobb and her colleagues extracted 17 cores from fossilized corals on two tiny islands, Christmas and Fanning, in the Line Islands archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean.</P><P>
Researchers painstakingly examined each core millimeter by millimeter, using radioactive dating to determine the age of each sample.</P><P>
To determine how temperature and precipitation had changed during each coral's lifetime, the scientists tracked variations in the ratio of two oxygen isotopes, O-18 and O-16. During warm, rainy El Niño periods, the coral that grows has less O-18. During cool, drier La Niña events, new coral has more O-18.</P><P>
Cobbling together the data from those 17 coral samples -- each covering a period 20 to 80 years long -- allowed the scientists to reconstruct the ENSO cycle thousands of years into the past.</P><P>
The results show that the variability and strength of the ENSO cycle was greater during the 20th century than at most points in the 7,000-year fossil record -- but the episode is not unprecedented, the scientists said, pointing to a similar period during the early 17th century.</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>wire with permission from Environment &amp; Energy Publishing, LLC. <A href=""https://www.eenews.net"" target=""_blank"">www.eenews.net</A>, 202-628-6500</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3><SECTION class=""article-author""><DIV class=""article-author__main""><P class=""article-author__desc t_body t_body--article"">Lauren Morello works for <A href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/index.html"" target=""_blank""><EM>Nature</EM></A> magazine.</P><DIV class=""article-author__suggested""><H4 class=""article-author__suggested__title"">Recent Articles</H4></DIV></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

This has been put to use in increasing volumes over the years to generate heat and power, and its potential as a fuel, particularly in cogeneration, was one of the main catalysts involved in the development of bubbling fluidised bed (BFB) and circulating fluidised bed (CFB) combustion for energy-generation purposes.</P><P class=""para"">Forest products giant Stora Enso and leading refiner Neste Oil have now set their sights on developing technology to produce a new generation of biofuel from this type of residue, and have set up a 50/50 joint venture known as NSE Biofuels for the purpose. A 12 MW demonstration plant for gasification and gas reforming trials is currently being built at Stora Enso’s Varkaus mill in central Finland and is scheduled to start up in spring 2009.</P><P class=""para""><A href=""javascript:openWindow('/modules/system/stdreq.aspx?P=38&amp;VID=default&amp;SID=708189695848969&amp;S=3&amp;template=plain&amp;A=open%3ahtf%3aimage_popup%3a742%3a1&amp;C=37302','popupWindow',800,600,'no','no','no','no','yes','yes');"">The process behind Stora Enso / Neste Oil Joint Venture</A></P><P class=""subtitle"">Ultra-clean syngas</P><P class=""para"">The biomass gasification technology being employed was initially developed as part of the Ultra Clean Gas project, which ran between 2004 and 2007 and was led by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, which is acting as the main research and testing partner for the joint venture. Gasification equipment is being supplied by Foster Wheeler, a leader in the field.</P><P class=""para"">The demonstration process is based on the use of Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis and covers the entire chain from drying wood-based biomass to testing the FT catalysts needed to produce bio-based crude wax that can then be refined into premium-quality renewable diesel by Neste Oil. Much of the development effort has focused on ensuring good syngas output from of an oxygen-blown CFB gasifier and that it can be reformed and cleaned catalytically to a sufficiently high level of purity to yield the best results from the latest generation of FT synthesis.</P><P class=""para"">Energy efficiency, the ability to handle different types of feedstock, and the potential for integration with existing pulp and paper mills have also been prioritised in the design.</P><P class=""para"">The demonstration plant will start using sawmill by-products, shavings, and sawdust before testing the main feedstock intended for a commercial-scale plant: forest residues, such as logging waste, stumps, and small-dimension logs that cannot be used as pulpwood.</P><P class=""para"">When sufficient experience has been accumulated with the demonstration plant, the plan is to build a full-scale commercial facility at one of Stora Enso’s mills capable of producing in the order of 100,000 t/a of bio-based crude wax for final refining into renewable diesel by Neste Oil.</P><P class=""para"">Over the longer term, the gasification technology being developed could have the potential for producing other products, such as chemicals, plastics, and alcohols.</P></DIV><DIV class=""infobox""><DIV class=""highlight""><DIV class=""contents""><P class=""heading"">Leaders in their industries</P><P class=""para"">Stora Enso is an integrated forest products company that produces newsprint, magazine paper, fine paper, consumer board, industrial packaging, and wood products.

The company’s refineries at Porvoo and Naantali have a combined crude oil refining capacity of some 260,000 barrels a day. One plant based on the company’s NExBTL technology is already producing advanced renewable diesel – which offers greater effcieincy and a lower level of environmental impact than either fossil diesel or FAME-type biodiesel – and another three are building: in Finland, the Netherlands, and Singapore.</P><DIV class=""hr""> </DIV><P class=""heading"">A <mark>sustainable</mark> resource</P><P class=""para"">The world’s growing demand for biofuels is being driven by a mix of factors, such as <mark>climate change</mark>, ambitious regulatory targets, uncertainties surrounding the future price and availability of oil, and a desire for increased energy self-sufficiency.</P><P class=""para"">New-generation biofuels, such as the wood-based renewable diesel being developed by the Stora Enso-Neste Oil joint venture, have the potential to make a valuable contribution to reducing CO₂ emissions, by replacing fossil fuels with a <mark>carbon</mark>-neutral alternative.

Despite considerable progress in our understanding of the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on many of the processes that contribute to ENSO variability (e.g., Collins et al. 2010), it is not yet possible to say whether ENSO activity will be enhanced or damped, or if the frequency or character of events will change in the coming decades (Vecchi and Wittenberg 2010). As changes in ENSO have the potential to be one of the largest manifestations of anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>, this status has profound impacts on the reliability of regional attribution of <mark>climate</mark> variability and change. Two main reasons can be invoked for these shortcomings. First there is a lack of long and comprehensive enough observations of the various ENSO processes to be able to detect past changes. It may be that we need to observe ENSO for another several decades to detect and attribute significant ENSO changes (Wittenberg 2009; Stevenson et al. 2012). Second, as ENSO involves a complex interplay of numerous ocean and atmospheric processes, accurately modeling this <mark>climate</mark> phenomenon with CGCMs, and understanding, anticipating, and predicting its behaviour on seasonal to decadal and longer time scales still pose formidable challenges (Guilyardi et al. 2009). Even though the ability of CGCMs to simulate El Niño has largely improved over the last few years, the diversity of model simulations of present-day El Niño characteristics indicate current limitations in our ability to model this <mark>climate</mark> phenomenon and anticipate changes in its properties on short and long time scales. In this context, there is a pressing need to assess how can we use models to anticipate potential changes to ENSO in a warmer <mark>climate</mark>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-node""><H2 class=""pane-title"">

But what about when we look at it more indirectly? Looking at other elements of the <mark>climate</mark> system, for example, we can focus on one reasonably robust finding: an intensification of mean rainfall in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific is ‘<EM>likely,' </EM>according to the <A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch1s1-6.html"">IPCC criteria.</A> Recently, my colleagues and I have been focusing on the possibility that these overall rainfall changes may impact ENSO. </P><H3>
	Answers at last?</H3><P>There have been a number of modeling studies since the publication of the IPCC report that have seemed to hint at a clearer picture of future changes in ENSO. The picture began to come into focus when looking at changes in the <EM>rainfall response</EM> in the equatorial Pacific to an El Niño event (Cai et al., 2014) rather than just changes in the ocean surface temperature in the traditional regions (<A href=""http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/nino_regions.shtml"">Niño-3 or Niño-3.4</A>).</P><P>By “rainfall response,” I mean the differences in intensity or location of rainfall anomalies during El Niño. During an El Niño event, massive cumulus clouds and rainfall linked to atmosphere convection move away from Indonesia, out into the central or eastern Pacific following the eastward extension of warm waters. Figures 1 and 2 show the shift in convection with transition from ENSO-neutral to El Niño conditions.</P><DIV class=""media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__16178 img__view_mode__float_left attr__format__float_left inline-img-caption""><SPAN class=""ii-caption""><DIV class=""field field-name-field-caption field-type-text-long field-label-hidden""><DIV class=""field-items""><DIV class=""field-item even""><P>Generalized Walker Circulation (December-February) during ENSO-neutral conditions.  Convection associated with rising branches of the Walker Circulation is found over the Maritime continent, northern South America, and eastern Africa.

During very strong or ‘extreme’ El Niño events, such as those that occurred in 1982/3 and 1997/8, the convection reached all the way into the tropical east Pacific, reaching South America (2).</P><P>So, if we consider El Niño events only in terms of these rainfall patterns, what do <mark>climate</mark> models show us? First, we find that not all models can simulate present day conditions very well. However, some do. When we look at the <mark>climate change</mark> simulations of these better models, we see an increase in instances where rainfall spreads all the way into the east Pacific, as is the case for more extreme El Niños (3) but not for moderate events.</P><P>So, there may be some model agreement on changes in the most extreme El Niño events in the future when viewing the phenomena in terms of rainfall patterns rather that SST patterns.</P><H3>
	But is that the final answer?  </H3><P>Just because the change is seen in models, or even a subset of models, doesn’t mean that we should believe it without question. Not only do we have to factor in errors or biases in the models, but we also have to have a convincing physical argument for the changes.</P><P>A feature of model predictions for the end of the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century is an increase in the average rainfall over the equatorial central and eastern Pacific. Average rainfall changes in the tropics are related to changes in atmospheric circulation (Chadwick et al., 2013), which are, in turn, closely tied to changes in sea surface temperature (SST) patterns. In particular, there is a equatorial maximum in SST warming across the Pacific basin which is seen in many different models (Xie et al., 2010).</P><P>But these SST changes are occurring in a region where there are known and persistent biases in <mark>climate</mark> models. The relatively colder SSTs in the east Pacific (“cold tongue”) are often too cold and extend too far into the central and, sometimes, west Pacific. If the models represent the region as being colder than it is at present, the predicted warming they show may be exaggerated. Hence the change in rainfall which seems to occur in all models might be tied to errors in SSTs which are common to all models.</P><P>As far as a good physical explanation for the projected changes, one hypothesis for the increase in the frequency of extreme El Niño events is that, because of average rainfall increases in the equatorial Pacific, it is easier for El Niño events to shift atmospheric convection from the west Pacific Warm Pool region into the east. In others words, the atmosphere is already primed to rain harder.</P><DIV class=""media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__16663 img__view_mode__float_left attr__format__float_left inline-img-caption""><SPAN class=""ii-caption""><DIV class=""field field-name-field-caption field-type-text-long field-label-hidden""><DIV class=""field-items""><DIV class=""field-item even""><P>Changes in mean rainfall under <A href=""http://www.wmo.int/pages/themes/<mark>climate</mark>/emission_scenarios.php"">Representative Concentration Pathway</A> (RCP) 8.5 for the period 2081-2100 expressed as anomalies with respect to 1986-2005. Hatching indicates regions where the multi-model mean change is less than the natural variability (computed from 20-year averages taken from pre-industrial control experiments). Images generated using <A href=""http://climexp.knmi.nl/plot_atlas_form.py"">http://climexp.knmi.nl/plot_atlas_form.py</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SPAN></DIV><P>So, the picture of changes in ENSO, when viewed in terms rainfall response patterns, may be limited by errors and biases that have been long-term features in <mark>climate</mark> models. Research is required to test the potential impact of SST biases on the change in average precipitation in the tropics. We must improve models, but we must also to better understand the processes whereby biases in present-day simulations link to future projections. Until we get a better handle on these issues, the prediction of an overall increase in rainfall in the eastern tropical Pacific, and its year-to-year variability, remains uncertain.</P><H3>

The targets have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative.“For over a decade we have been actively reducing the energy-intensity of our operations and our dependence on fossil fuels,” says Stora Enso CEO Karl-Henrik Sundström. “As a company operating in a bioeconomy and using renewable raw materials, we are in a unique position to take the next step.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">We are now committing to further reducing our <mark>CO2</mark>and other greenhouse gas emissions in line with the 2°C limit set for global warming by the Paris Agreement. The new targets coveremissions from our own operations, but also includes engagement targets for our partners all through the value chain.”  The target commits Stora Enso to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from operations by 31% per tonne of pulp, paper and board produced by 2030 from a 2010 base-year. To reduce emissions in the value chain, Stora Enso commits to have 70% of non-fibre suppliers and downstream transportation suppliers in terms of spend set their own GHG reduction targets by 2025, towards the aim that these suppliers adopt science-based GHG reduction targets by 2030. In addition, the company will educate 100% of customer-facing staff on the advantages of setting science-based targets by 2020. Alexander Liedke, Manager of <mark>Sustainable</mark> Business &amp; Markets at WWF and member of the Science Based Targets initiative steering committee said, “We congratulate Stora Enso on being the first forest products company to have their science-based targets approved by our team. By setting targets that align their business with global efforts to avoid the worst impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>, Stora Enso is positioning itself to thrive as the global economy transitions to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> future. It is particularly encouraging to see Stora Enso working with its suppliers to adopt their own science-based targets, helping to mainstream science-based target setting across the value chain.” About the Science Based Targets Initiative Science Based Targets initiative mobilizes companies to set science-based targets and boost their competitive advantage in the transition to the low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy. It is a collaboration between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and one of the We Mean Business Coalition commitments. The initiative defines and promotes best practice in science-based target setting, offers resources and guidance to reduce barriers to adoption, and independently assesses and approves companies’ targets.sciencebasedtargets.org<SPAN>For further information, please contact: Ulrika Lilja, EVP, Communications, tel. +46 72 221 9228 Noel Morrin, EVP, Sustainability, tel. +46 73 076 8898 Investor enquiries: Ulla Paajanen-Sainio, SVP, Investor Relations, tel. +358 40 763 8767 Stora Enso is a leading provider of renewable solutions in packaging, biomaterials, wooden constructions and paper on global markets.

EU member states’ national targets for renewable energy generation agreed in 2009 have helped ensure that the EU is now the world’s largest producer and consumer of wood for energy. And although other member states use wood more extensively for heat, the UK is the EU’s largest user for electricity generation, mostly sourced from the US and Canada.</P><P>Wood for energy often has a positive image: a natural product of growing forests. The biomass energy industry, which has grown rapidly on the back of government subsidies, likes to contrast it with dirty coal or oil. They point to the government’s sustainability criteria, which notionally guarantee a reduction of at least 60 per cent in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the fossil fuels the biomass replaces.</P><P>The problem with this happy picture, however, is that in fact biomass, when burnt, <A href=""//www.chathamhouse.org/publication/impacts-demand-woody-biomass-power-and-heat-<mark>climate</mark>-and-forests"">emits more <mark>carbon</mark> per unit of energy than most fossil fuels.</A> The exact amount varies with the type of biomass and the type and age of the power plant, but figures from the Drax power station, Europe’s largest consumer of wood pellets, show that in 2013 it emitted about 13 per cent more <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide per unit of energy generated from biomass than from coal.</P><P>How is this consistent with meeting the government’s requirement for a 60 per cent reduction in emissions? Only by completely ignoring the <mark>carbon</mark> emitted when the wood is burnt; the sustainability criteria measure only supply-chain emissions from harvesting, processing and transporting the wood. (Direct land-use change – for example, clearance of the forest for agriculture or urban development – also falls outside the criteria, but biomass for energy generally originates from existing forests.)</P><P>This treatment of combustion emissions as zero – and thus, the awarding to wood the same kind of financial and regulatory support as other renewables such as solar PV and wind – is justified on the basis that the <mark>carbon</mark> contained in woody biomass is part of the natural forest cycle. The <mark>carbon</mark> released during combustion was absorbed by forest growth in the past and will be reabsorbed by forest growth in the future; in contrast, fossil fuels originate outside this cycle and their combustion adds <mark>carbon</mark> to the atmosphere.</P><P>But this argument rests on a basic fallacy. <mark>Carbon</mark> is <mark>carbon</mark>, wherever it comes from, and if you burn wood for energy, you increase <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere (by more than if you had used fossil fuels), and thereby contribute to <A href=""//www.chathamhouse.org/research/current-topics/<mark>climate</mark>""><mark>climate</mark></A> change. The fact that the <mark>carbon</mark> emitted was absorbed by growing trees in the past is simply irrelevant. After all, when it’s harvested you don’t have to burn it; you could use it for construction or furniture or window frames or a host of other uses, fixing the <mark>carbon</mark> in wood products rather than emitting it to the atmosphere.</P><H2><mark>Climate</mark> impacts</H2><P>It is true that continued forest growth will absorb <mark>carbon</mark> in the future, but the process is a long one, taking decades or even centuries if whole trees are harvested and burnt. Replacing large mature trees, with plentiful leaf cover absorbing large volumes of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, with small young ones mean that the rate of <mark>carbon</mark> uptake will be far lower for years. On top of that, the impact of harvesting itself releases soil <mark>carbon</mark> into the atmosphere, further accelerating <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The impact on the <mark>climate</mark> of using sawmill or forest residues for energy rather than whole trees is undoubtedly lower, since these tend to be wastes from other industries which harvest trees for their own purposes, and do not imply any additional harvesting. Sawmill wastes which, if left to themselves, would rot and release their stored <mark>carbon</mark> into the atmosphere in a matter of months or years, are in many ways the ideal feedstock; it makes sense to use them for energy rather than leave them to decay. However, mill residues are already intensively used and there seems little room for expansion; <A href=""https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/gtr/gtr_wo091.pdf"" target=""_blank"">a survey in the US in 2011</A> found that over 99 per cent of mill residues were already used, mainly for energy and wood products such as particleboard.</P><P>Forest residues are the parts of harvested trees that are left in the forest after log products have been removed, including stumps, tops and small branches, and pieces too short or defective to be used; these can amount to as much as 40–60 per cent of the total tree volume. Their impact on the <mark>climate</mark> if used for energy varies significantly. While the smallest pieces tend to rot and release their stored <mark>carbon</mark> into the atmosphere quite quickly, if left in the forest, they are generally not suitable for use for energy, as they contain too much dirt and ash to be burnt cleanly. Larger pieces are more suitable but take much longer to decay; burning them for energy instead of leaving them in the forest thereby increases <mark>carbon</mark> concentrations in the atmosphere for years or decades. And on top of that, a portion of the <mark>carbon</mark> and other substances contained in the residues is transferred to the soil as they decay; their removal from the forest for energy may reduce both soil <mark>carbon</mark> and the levels of the nutrients trees need to grow, again with negative impacts on the <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>The biomass industry generally likes to claim that it uses mainly mill and forest residues, though on closer inspection the categories they report often contain whole trees, perhaps classified as ‘unmerchantable’ or similar. (This is not helped by the fact the categories used by Ofgem, for example, to whom UK biomass users have to report, are confusing and potentially overlapping.) Several independent studies, however, have concluded that the use of mill and forest residues is in reality substantially lower; pellet plants in the US – the UK’s main source of supply – <A href=""http://www.aebiom.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DG-ENVI-study-imports-from-US-Final-report-July-2016.pdf"" target=""_blank"">in fact</A><A href=""http://docplayer.net/25281897-An-analysis-of-uk-biomass-power-policy-us-south-pellet-production-and-impacts-on-wood-fiber-markets-prepared-for-the-american-forest-paper.html"" target=""_blank"">source</A> about 75 per cent whole trees.</P><P>Setting aside these arguments about feedstock, however, can it be safely assumed that future forest growth allows us to treat biomass as <mark>carbon</mark>-neutral? If the trees would have grown anyway, even in the absence of the biomass energy industry, it cannot be assumed that their future absorption of <mark>carbon</mark> cancels out the <mark>carbon</mark> emitted when wood is burnt. If the rate of <mark>carbon</mark> absorption in forests remains the same whether or not some of the harvested wood is burnt, then clearly, the best outcome for the <mark>climate</mark> in the short and probably medium term is not to burn it, but to use it for wood products or leave it to decay slowly in the forest. This is not an academic argument: the current global rate of emissions of greenhouse gases is incompatible with the aims of the Paris Agreement and may risk triggering irreversible tipping points in the Earth’s <mark>climate</mark> system. We need to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions now, not in several decades’ or centuries’ time.</P><P>The biomass industry likes to point to the expansion of US forests in recent decades to show that forests overall have been absorbing more <mark>carbon</mark> even while increasing volumes are burnt for energy – sometimes implying that this forest growth has been encouraged by the demand for energy. But in fact US forest expansion started in the 1950s, decades before European subsidies stimulated the expansion of the modern biomass industry. And there is little evidence of recent overall forest growth in the US southeast, the location of almost all the pellet plants supplying European demand. In any case, the point is not whether US (or European) forests are expanding, but whether they would have grown at a different rate if part of their wood had <EM>not</EM> been burnt for energy. If they would have grown at the same rate, or faster, in the absence of biomass energy use then it cannot be assumed that using wood for biomass is good for forests, or the <mark>climate</mark>.</P><H2>Redirecting public money</H2><P>There is no question that renewable energy policy and forest policy both have a critical role to play in the mitigation of <mark>climate change</mark>. But governments have limited resources to deploy in their support, which is why the Chatham House paper questions whether it is really a good use of public money to subsidise activities which release stored forest <mark>carbon</mark> into the atmosphere, thereby increasing <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and accelerating <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>I argue instead that support should be limited to those feedstocks which genuinely reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions over the short term – i.e. mill residues and post-consumer wood waste. This would not only have a positive direct impact on the <mark>climate</mark> but would also release more resources for genuine zero-<mark>carbon</mark> technologies, such as solar, wind or tidal – and perhaps also for programmes encouraging afforestation and the more extensive use of wood in buildings and products. Use it, don’t burn it.</P><P><EM>To comment on this article, please contact <A href=""//www.chathamhouse.org/forms/chatham-house-feedback"">Chatham House Feedback</A></EM></P></DIV><DIV class=""block-sharethis-sharethis-block block block-sharethis sharebar""><H2>Share</H2></DIV></SECTION></ARTICLE></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

To increase the fire resistance of structures such as wall, ceiling or roof elements, plaster building materials (gypsum plasterboard, etc.) are generally used as, even if they are not very thick, they provide effective protection.
Effective protection is particularly based on the combined crystal water in the panels’ gypsum core, which has a concentration of approximately 20%. Energy is consumed by the evaporation of this crystal water, and a protective steam curtain is also formed on the fire-exposed side of the panel. In addition to delaying the spread of fire, the dehydrated gypsum layer also acts as insulation through the declining thermal conductivity.
Fire protection plasterboard also contains glass fibre which reinforces the gypsum core and ensures structural cohesion when exposed to fire.
European standard EN 1995‑1‑2, or its national requirements and supplements, specifies equations for determining fire resistance. Based on previous tests on timber frame constructions, these equations are used to determine two key times: the time when charring begins behind the gypsum plasterboard cladding, and the failure time of this cladding.
However, several large-scale fire tests performed in recent years on clad CLT elements have overshadowed the failure times of gypsum plasterboard determined according to the standards. The large-scale fire tests revealed significantly higher failure times for plasterboard fire protection directly attached to Stora Enso CLT elements. These times have been confirmed in an expert opinion and may be used when designing structures in accordance with EN 1995‑1‑2. For example, in the case of 12.5 mm-thick gypsum plasterboard, vertical components reached a failure time of 55.0 minutes rather than the 31.5 minutes determined according to the standards. In turn, this signifies a considerable advantage with regard to the charring depth or residual cross-section to be determined.
These higher failure times only apply to fire protection plasterboard in accordance with ÖNORM B 3410 or DIN 18180, or to type F and DF gypsum plasterboard in accordance with EN 520 directly attached to Stora Enso CLT wall elements.
More information on the failure times of gypsum plasterboard and the corresponding calculation methods can be found in the comprehensive document “<SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline""><A href=""http://www.clt.info/en/product/technical-specifications/fire-safety/"">CLT documentation on fire protection</A></SPAN>”.</P></DIV></ARTICLE><ARTICLE class=""news""><DIV class=""teaser-box""><TIME class=""meta"">March 2014</TIME><H4>CLT can also be used in a different way – as a supporting material for façade elements</H4><P>The Austrian company, GAP solutions, is specialised in providing intelligent façade solutions for the <mark>sustainable</mark> restoration of buildings.</P><P>At the end of 2013, an apartment complex in Graz (Austria) was converted into a passive house using pre-fabricated solar façade elements.

For this project, 600 m³ of pre-cut, non-visual quality CLT was delivered to the company Kulmer Bau (Pischelsdorf, Austria) where the façades were mounted onto CLT elements under the critical eye of the quality controllers, GAP solutions. The company Kulmer then mounted the pre-fabricated façade elements onto the buildings in situ. GAP solutions opted for CLT because, as a supporting material, CLT offers structural advantages and simplifies installation. Furthermore, the residents did not have to move out at all while the renovation work was going on.

Year after year, around 70,000 employees are made redundant during the winter months because the number of orders falls rapidly towards the end of the summer. In recent years, the early onset of winter and long periods of cold weather have severely afflicted construction activities and made the building season even shorter.
However, all is not lost thanks to CLT solid wood elements which have successfully demonstrated that building work can continue even throughout the cold winter months. Stora Enso, the market leader, supplies internationally acclaimed construction projects directly from its factories. CLT enables a high level of prefabrication and offers virtually boundless possibilities in terms of construction concept, style and architecture. Many elements can be prefabricated in the factory and this reduces construction times at building sites by up to 40%. In addition, the prefabricated elements can be assembled in all seasons. CLT is the construction material of the future and offers building industry companies and employees huge potential, providing them with a <mark>sustainable</mark> alternative when it comes to adapting to changing weather conditions.
According to a survey carried out by the opinion research centre <I>market</I> in 2010, the popularity of wood as a building material is steadily increasing. As many as 80% of those questioned have a positive attitude towards wood. In the private construction sector, the construction of timber houses has increased by 10% since 2009, and the trend towards wood is also evident in the municipal development sector. CLT plays out its strengths particularly in larger construction and urban development projects. Whether for loft conversions or multi-storey buildings in urban spaces, more and more builders are opting for CLT. This is great news for the building industry, as the more CLT is used as an all-year-round building material, the more positive the effect will be on seasonally fluctuating unemployment and economic uncertainty.</P></DIV></ARTICLE><ARTICLE class=""news""><DIV class=""teaser-box""><TIME class=""meta"">June 2013</TIME><H4>Earthquake simulation</H4><P>A three-storey CLT building was exposed to different earthquake simulations on a shaking table.

However, this is changing, according to the authorities in Finland and Sweden. The unusually mild winters turned the soil into a dense layer of mud capable of swallowing a 25-tonne machine, used to collect material, which subsequently turns into pulp, paper and packaging.</P><P>Temperatures in many places in Sweden were up to 3 degrees Celsius higher than normal for December and January, according to data from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. This warming is part of a trend that is likely to hold on, officials said, expecting the degrees to continue to rise over the next six decades, pushed up by global warming.</P><P>The difficulties, which the businesses in Scandinavian forests is facing, highlight the impact of the <mark>climate change</mark>. Although warming opens up new waterways and routes for exploring natural resources, the countries and companies in the region are forced to resort to different ways of doing their traditional business.</P><P>For Swedish and Finnish companies such as BillerudKorsanas, Holmen AB, <mark>Stora Enso Oyj</mark> and UPM-Kymmene Oyj, the <mark>climate change</mark> is a major challenge as if the ground does not freeze enough to withstand heavy machinery, the companies can not reach the timber and need to move their business. Also, the high water levels after wet and soft autumn and winter create a difficult situation for timber supply.</P><P>And this is particularly important for the local economies. Forestry products have for centuries been a pillar of the Swedish and Finnish economies. The exports of such goods represent 10% of all Swedish exports for the past year and 22% of Finland’s exports in 2016.</P><P>“The main reason for the scarcity of wood for pulp is the unusually humid and soft winter”, said BillerudKorsnas in January. The company, which receives 75% of its raw material from the Swedish forests, warned that higher temperatures led to a shortage of raw materials at the end of 2017 and early 2018 and a negative impact on first-quarter earnings.</P><P>The company has begun to scan forest with lasers and draw maps of the more sensitive areas in an attempt to find more stable routes. BillerudKorsnas is also starting to use larger tires as well as special rubber tracks for some machines in an attempt to limit damage to soil and forest growth – another problem that comes from softer times.</P></DIV><DIV class=""share-post""><SPAN class=""share-text"">Share</SPAN></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

They were selected from more than 3,300 companies that were assessed. CDP collaborated with the UK’s <mark>Carbon</mark> Saving Trust and BSR in compiling the report.</P><P>	The report, which analyses <mark>climate</mark> and water-related data disclosed to CDP by more than 4,300 supplier-companies, reveals that reductions equivalent to 434 million tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide – more than France’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2014 – were achieved by suppliers worldwide in 2016.</P><P>	HP was singled out for helping its suppliers avoid 800,000 tonnes of <mark>CO2</mark>e emissions through energy-saving action plans targeting local efficiency improvements. (see <A href=""http://www.ethicalcorp.com/how-re100-helped-hp-put-sustainability-stake-ground"">How RE100 helped HP put a sustainability stake in the ground</A>).</P><P>	Dutch technology company Royal Philips was praised for targeting “risk suppliers” for participation in its numerous supplier sustainability programmes. It has also developed a tool to help suppliers to quantify their <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.</P><P>	Meanwhile BT’s new online sustainability assessment tool aims to help its suppliers understand how to reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> impact.</P><P>	With supply chains responsible for on average four times a company’s direct emissions, they are a critical focus area for companies seeking to avoid the risks presented by the low-<mark>carbon</mark> transition, CDP said. Yet despite a 20% increase since 2015 in the number of big buyers requesting <mark>climate</mark> and water-related data from their suppliers, only 22% of supplier respondents in the survey engage with their own suppliers on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and 16% engage with their suppliers on water use.</P><P>	Common barriers include lack of experience in calculating and managing their own emissions, a perceived lack of leverage over business partners, costs associated with managing an engagement programme and an absence of mandatory requirements from customers or regulation.</P><P>
	The report contains a four-part framework, developed by the <mark>Carbon</mark> Trust, for companies to catalyse change within their supply chains.</P><P>	“The overall picture that emerges is that the sustainability commitments and practices of leading organizations are not being replicated at scale downwards through the supply chain,” the report says. “And even among leading organizations, there is a comparative immaturity in strategies to address supply chain impacts when compared with their action on direct impacts.”</P><P>	Dexter Galvin, head of supply chain, CDP said: “Companies have a critical role to play in delivering on the Paris Agreement, and as well as setting their own house in order, it is essential they turn their attention to the risks and opportunities outsourced to their supply chain.”</P><P>	The 29 companies recognized on CDP’s supplier engagement leader board are:</P><P>	3M Company</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
