In The Great Derangement he goes a step further and sets us amidst the great collectivity of a living and dying planet. This intensely lyrical work from a visionary writer at his best calls for a restitution of the sacred- in its most inclusive form - so that we can face the <mark>climate</mark> crisis of our times with our finest remaining resources.” Leela Gandhi, Brown University</P><P>“Amitav Ghosh has written brilliant fiction, impactful essays. But this work on <mark>climate change</mark> is the most transformational and powerful piece of writing to come from his pen. The Great Derangement is a book on our burning planet for those who are burning it and are being burnt with it. Ghosh gives us, in scalding anguish, a masterpiece that reflects the Buddha's Adittapariyaya Sutta or 'The Fire Sermon' which T S Eliot so plangently re-affirmed in The Waste Land. We have here a book that seeks to chastise, challenge and change our brain's clogged circuitry.” Gopal Gandhi</P><P>&quot;<mark>Climate change</mark> is one of the most important factors that has shaped human history. Much has been written about the science of <mark>climate change</mark>, but in his new book The Great Derangement, one of India's best known storytellers explores an interesting new question - the inability of the modern literary imagination to grasp the sheer scale of change that may await us.&quot; Sanjeev Sanyal</P><H3>About the Author</H3><P>Amitav Ghosh is an award-winning novelist and essayist whose books include 'The Circle of Reason', 'The Shadow Lines', 'In an Antique Land', 'Dancing in Cambodia', 'The Calcutta Chromosome', 'The Glass Palace', 'The Hungry Tide and the Ibis Trilogy: Sea of Poppies', 'River of Smoke' and 'Flood of Fire'.

        A Conversation with Amitav Ghosh
    </H3><P>
            The Great Derangement is award-winning author Amitav Ghosh’s first non-fiction book in nearly a decade. In this ground-breaking work, he examines why humanity at the level of literature, history and politics has failed to grasp the scale and violence of <mark>climate change</mark>. We caught up with him to know more about the premise of his latest work. An excerpt from an interview with the author.
        </P><P>
            Q. Why have we as a society collectively failed to talk about the impact of <mark>climate change</mark>?
        </P><P>
            Amitav Ghosh: It is certainly true that our institutions have not been able to address <mark>climate change</mark> effectively. But what interests me most is why artists and writers in particular haven’t (with some honorable exceptions) treated <mark>climate change</mark> with the seriousness that it deserves. This is, in a sense, the central question of ‘The Great Derangement’.
        </P><P>
            Q. You suggest that the extreme nature of today’s <mark>climate</mark> events make them resistant to contemporary modes of thinking and imagining, why?
        </P><P>
            Amitav Ghosh: It may have something to do with some of the modes of thought that became dominant in the 19th century and which are still influential today. In the book I’ve examined some of these forms of thought, like ‘gradualism’ and ‘catastrophism’ in geology.
        </P><P>
            Q. How does <mark>climate change</mark> impact politics?
        </P><P>
            Amitav Ghosh: It impacts politics at multiple levels. In some countries <mark>climate</mark> science has come to be viewed through a conspiratorial lens and has been conflated with other, completely unrelated political issues. Elsewhere <mark>climate change</mark> has had a ‘multiplier effect’ that has exacerbated already existing tensions and conflicts. Syria and South Sudan are good examples.

            Q. Is there any connection between the <mark>climate</mark> crisis and human migration?
        </P><P class=""a-spacing-base"">
            Amitav Ghosh: Yes there is a direct connection. In Bangladesh for example rising sea levels have forced many people to abandon their lands. Some of these ‘<mark>climate</mark> migrants’ have had no choice but to move to cities or even to other countries. 
        </P><P class=""a-spacing-base"">
            Q. How does <mark>climate change</mark> impact the economy? 
        </P><P class=""a-spacing-base"">
            Amitav Ghosh: Some impacts are all too obvious – changing patterns of rainfall will certainly have an impact on agriculture, rising sea levels will threaten coastal cities and so on. But there will be many other impacts as well there is an extensive literature on the subject.
        </P><P class=""a-spacing-base"">
            Q. Who are your literary forbearers, your mentors? 
        </P><P class=""a-spacing-base"">
            Amitav Ghosh: Herman Melville is a writer who has had a great influence on my work. He was intensely attentive to the ways in which human beings interacted with their surroundings. 
        </P><P class=""a-spacing-base"">
            Q. In the book, you very eloquently draw attention to the cataclysmic impact of global warming, how do you suggest we take more action, both individually as well as collectively? 
        </P><P class=""a-spacing-base"">
            Amitav Ghosh: Some <mark>climate change</mark> impacts are now unavoidable, like sea level rise. We can certainly prepare for the consequences both individually and collectively. 
        </P><P class=""a-spacing-base"">
            Q. What are you working on next?
        </P><P class=""a-spacing-base"">
            Amitav Ghosh: I am working on several things, among them a short book, based on my research for the Ibis Trilogy, on the global impact of the 19th century China trade.

The team looked at rainfall measurements and the moisture content of the forest canopy. </P><P>The most striking data came from the summer of 2005, when 270,000 square miles of forest experienced a severe drought that caused widespread, observable damage to the canopy. The drought conditions were so severe that the rainforest was unable to fully recover before the next drought struck in 2010. </P><P>&quot;The biggest surprise for us was that the effects appeared to persist for years after the 2005 drought,&quot; Yadvinder Malhi of Oxford University and co-author of the study <A href=""http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-025"">said in a press release</A>. &quot;We had expected the forest canopy to bounce back after a year with a new flush of leaf growth, but the damage appeared to persist right up to the subsequent drought in 2010.&quot;</P><P>The two extensive droughts - called a &quot;double whammy&quot; by one researcher - could mean the region, known as Amazonia, will suffer long-lasting damage. It is also more evidence for the increasingly clear fact that the Amazon is receiving less and less rainfall per year.</P><P>Observations from ground stations in the southern Amazon have found that average rainfall in the region dropped nearly 3.2 percent per year in the period from 1970 to 1998. <mark>Climate</mark> analyses from the period from 1995 to 2005 also show a steady decline in water availability in the forest. This prolonged period of below-average rain may have exacerbated the damage caused by the current megadrought. </P><P>Tropical forests, home to countless animal and plant species, are considered some of the most diverse areas on the planet. Rainforests are sensitive ecosystems, and the reduced rainfall has had a noticeable impact on the region. Satellite and ground data has found an increase in wildfires and tree die-offs following droughts. </P><P>&quot;Our results suggest that if droughts continue at five- to 10-year intervals or increase in frequency due to <mark>climate change</mark>, large areas of the Amazon forest are likely to be exposed to persistent effects of droughts and corresponding slow forest recovery,&quot; said NASA scientist Sassan Saatchi, lead researcher of the study. &quot;This may alter the structure and function of Amazonian rainforest ecosystems.&quot;</P><P>Results of the study were published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""copyright"">© 2013 CBS Interactive Inc.

(02/20/2008) One of the worst droughts on record in the Amazon was caused by high temperatures in the Atlantic rather than el Nino. The research, published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, suggests that human-driven warming is already affecting the <mark>climate</mark> of Earth's largest rainforest.
<B><A href=""https://news.mongabay.com/2008/0124-nepstad.html"">55% of the Amazon may be lost by 2030</A></B>
(01/23/2008) Cattle ranching, industrial soy farming, and logging are three of the leading drivers of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. As commodity prices continue to rise, driven by surging demand for biofuels and grain for meat production, the economic incentives for developing the Amazon increase. Already the largest exporter of beef and the second largest producer of soy - with the largest expanse of &quot;undeveloped&quot; but arable land of any country - Brazil is well on its way to rivaling the U.S. as the world's agricultural superpower. The trend towards turning the Amazon into a giant breadbasket seems unstoppable. Nevertheless the decision at the U.N. <mark>climate</mark> talks in Bali to include &quot;Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Degradation&quot; (REDD) in future <mark>climate</mark> treaty negotiations may preempt this fate, says Dr. Daniel Nepstad, a scientist at the Woods Hole Research Institute.

(11/07/2007) While the mention of Amazon destruction usually conjures up images of vast stretches of felled and burned rainforest trees, cattle ranches, and vast soybean farms, some of the biggest threats to the Amazon rainforest are barely perceptible from above. Selective logging -- which opens up the forest canopy and allows winds and sunlight to dry leaf litter on the forest floor -- and 6-inch high &quot;surface&quot; fires are turning parts of the Amazon into a tinderbox, putting the world's largest rainforest at risk of ever-more severe forest fires. At the same time, market-driven hunting is impoverishing some areas of seed dispersers and predators, making it more difficult for forests to recover. <mark>Climate change</mark> -- an its forecast impacts on the Amazon basin -- further looms large over the horizon.
<B><A href=""https://news.mongabay.com/2007/1021-amazon.html"">2007 Amazon fires among worst ever</A></B>
(10/22/2007) By some measures, forest fires in the Amazon are at near-record levels, according to analysis Brazilian satellite data by mongabay.com. A surge in soy and cattle prices may be contributing to an increase in deforestation since last year. Last year environmentalists and the Brazilian government heralded a sharp fall in deforestation rates, the third consecutive annual decline after a peak in 2004. Forest loss in the 2006-2007 season was the lowest since record-keeping began in the late in 1970s. While the government tried to claim credit for the drop, analysts at the time said that commodity prices were a more likely driver of slow down: both cattle and soy prices had declined significantly over the previous months.
<B><A href=""https://news.mongabay.com/2007/0604-nepstad_interview.html"">Globalization could save the Amazon rainforest</A></B>
(06/03/2007) The Amazon basin is home to the world's largest rainforest, an ecosystem that supports perhaps 30 percent of the world's terrestrial species, stores vast amounts of <mark>carbon</mark>, and exerts considerable influence on global weather patterns and <mark>climate</mark>. Few would dispute that it is one of the planet's most important landscapes. Despite its scale, the Amazon is also one of the fastest changing ecosystems, largely as a result of human activities, including deforestation, forest fires, and, increasingly, <mark>climate change</mark>. Few people understand these impacts better than Dr. Daniel Nepstad, one of the world's foremost experts on the Amazon rainforest. Now head of the Woods Hole Research Center's Amazon program in Belem, Brazil, Nepstad has spent more than 23 years in the Amazon, studying subjects ranging from forest fires and forest management policy to <mark>sustainable</mark> development. Nepstad says the Amazon is presently at a point unlike any he's ever seen, one where there are unparalleled risks and opportunities. While he's hopeful about some of the trends, he knows the Amazon faces difficult and immediate challenges.
<B><A href=""https://news.mongabay.com/2007/0508-amazon.html"">Amazon rainforest locks up 11 years of <mark>CO2</mark> emissions</A></B>
(05/08/2007) The amount and distribution of above ground biomass (or the amount of <mark>carbon</mark> contained in vegetation) in the Amazon basin is largely unknown, making it difficult to estimate how much <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is produced through deforestation and how much is sequestered through forest regrowth. To address this uncertainty, a team of scientists from Caltech, the Woods Hole Institute, and INPE (Brazil's space agency), have developed a new method to determine forest biomass using remote sensing and field plot measurements. The researchers say the work will help them better understand the role of Amazon rainforest in global <mark>climate change</mark>.
<B><A href=""https://news.mongabay.com/2007/0314-hammond.html"">Amazon rainforest fires date back thousands of years</A></B>
(03/14/2007) Fires are nothing new to the Amazon reports a study published in the journalBiotropica. Analyzing soils in the eastern Amazon, a team of scientists led by David S. Hammond of NWFS Consulting, has found evidence of forest fires dating back thousands of years. While the origin of these fires is unclear, the authors propose intriguing scenarios involving pre-Colombian human populations and ancient el Nino events which could have so dried rainforest areas that they became more prone to forest fires.
<B><A href=""https://news.mongabay.com/2006/1023-interview_fearnside.html"">Global warming could cause catastrophic die-off of Amazon rainforest by 2080</A></B>
(10/23/2006) For the Amazon, there is an immense threat looming on the horizon: <mark>climate change</mark> could well cause most of the Amazon rainforest to disappear by the end of the century. Dr. Philip Fearnside, a Research Professor at the National Institute for Research in the Amazon in Manaus, Brazil and one of the most cited scientists on the subject of <mark>climate change</mark>, understands the threat well. Having spent more than 30 years in Brazil and now recognized as one of the world's foremost experts on the Amazon rainforest, Fearnside is working to do nothing less than to save this remarkable ecosystem. Fearnside believes saving the Amazon will require a fundamental shift in perception where the Amazon is recognized as an asset beyond the current price of mahogany, soybeans, or cattle, where its value is only unlocked by its destruction. The Amazon is far worth more than this he says. It can play a key role in fighting <mark>climate change</mark> while providing economic sustenance for millions through <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture and rational utilization of its renewable products. It can serve as a storehouse for biodiversity while at the same time ensuring reliable water supplies and moderating regional temperature and precipitation. In short, maintaining the Amazon as a viable ecosystem makes sense economically and ecologically -- it is in our best interest to preserve this resource while we still can.
<B><A href=""https://news.mongabay.com/2006/1016-interview_laurance.html"">Rainforests face myriad of threats says leading Amazon scholar</A></B>
(10/17/2006) The world's tropical rainforests are in trouble. Spurred by a global commodity boom and continuing poverty in some of the world's poorest regions, deforestation rates have increased since the close of the 1990s. The usual threats to forests -- agricultural conversion, wildlife poaching, uncontrolled logging, and road construction -- could soon be rivaled, and even exceeded, by <mark>climate change</mark> and rising levels of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere. Understanding these threats is key to preserving forests and their ecological services for current and future generations. William F. Laurance, a distinguished scholar and president of the Association for Tropical Biology and conservation (ATBC) -- the world's largest scientific organization dedicated to the study and conservation of tropical ecosystems, is at the forefront of this effort.

There are not many references to it online, except for CEO Jeff Bezos’ famous Day One letter in which he outlined the company’s customer obsession. Back then, it had 614 employees and 200,000 titles on its site. The company’s cash balance was $125 million. For context, Amazon has 341,000 employees as of this year and reported $3.4 billion in net cash flow at the end of last year. (See also: <EM><A href=""/articles/investing/082715/if-you-had-invested-right-after-amazons-ipo.asp"">If You Had Invested Right After Amazon's IPO</A></EM>)</P><P>But annual shareholder meetings are about more than letters and statistics. As the e-commerce juggernaut and its effect on the retail economy grows, its annual meeting has also begun attracting protestors and well-wishers alike. For example, women’s rights groups urged Bezos to Dump Trump last year while animal rights activists protested the sale of foie gras on the company’s website. This year is not expected to be much different. (See also: <EM><A href=""/news/why-credit-suisse-thinks-amazon-will-fly-higher-amzn/"">Why Credit Suisse Thinks Amazon Will Fly Higher</A></EM>)</P><H2>What To Expect This Year </H2><P>The Seattle company’s annual shareholder meeting this year occurs against a backdrop of optimism about its prospects. Amazon introduced its cashless grocery store – Amazon Go - last December. According to reports, it is planning to expand the Amazon Go concept internationally. It is quite possible that Bezos will provide more than a hint of his plans for the concept during the meeting. The company’s smart assistant Alexa has moved from strength to strength to dominate the market for consumer-friendly AI technology. It is likely that we will get indicators of how and where Amazon is likely to move next. This year’s meeting will not be without protests. </P><P>According to reports, Amazon Prime Air cargo pilots <A href=""https://www.geekwire.com/2017/prime-air-cargo-pilots-<mark>climate</mark>-advocates-challenge-amazon-shareholder-meeting/"" target=""_blank"">protesting working conditions</A> and salaries and <mark>climate change</mark> activists urging the company to do more for civic and environmental issues are set to make their case heard at the annual general meeting through protests. Diversity in the technology industry is also likely to be on the agenda. After attending the company’s AGM in 2015, Reverend Jesse Jackson will be back this year to make a case for diversity. More diversity in its ranks should have a positive effect on Amazon’s bottom line. A McKinsey study <A href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters"" target=""_blank"">released recently</A> stated that companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35% more likely to have financial returns above national industry medians.</P><P> </P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

We’re now among the ranks of only two other countries who haven’t signed the agreement: Syria and Nicaragua (who didn’t sign the agreement because it<A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/05/31/why-nicaragua-and-syria-didnt-join-the-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-accord/?utm_term=.e305531a8137""> </A><A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/05/31/why-nicaragua-and-syria-didnt-join-the-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-accord/?utm_term=.e305531a8137"">wasn’t strict enough</A>).</P><P>As evidenced by this decision, President Trump can do many things that you may or may not agree with. Case in point: <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>communication.yale.edu/publications/paris_agreement_by_state/"">7 out of 10 American voters (and almost half of Trump voters) think the U.S. should participate in the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement</A>. While Trump can make decisions that have a big impact on your current and future well being, one area he cannot dictate is your spending. If you’re one of the 69% of Americans that support the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement, you can still put your money where your <mark>climate</mark> values are. To help you vote with your wallet, we’ve compiled a list of ways that you can use your normal daily spending to help combat <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><H2><SPAN style=""font-weight: bold; color: #666666;"">Use the Oroeco app</SPAN></H2><P>“What gets measured gets managed” is an old adage. The idea behind the<A href=""https://www.oroeco.com/""> </A><A href=""https://www.oroeco.com/"">Oroeco app</A> is that you can literally put a scientifically-verified number on how you live and what you buy every day.</P><P>All you have to do is link up your<A href=""http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2015/green-generation-millennials-say-sustainability-is-a-shopping-priority.html""> </A><A href=""http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2015/green-generation-millennials-say-sustainability-is-a-shopping-priority.html"">Mint.com account</A> (it’s free to sign up) and answer a few questions.

Can I get it on Amazon Smile?</P><P>Things like water bottles, grocery/produce bags, coffee cups, and paper towels are all great candidates for reusable replacements. A great side bonus?

Agriculture is the largest &quot;consumer&quot; of water because it pulls water from the source and locks it up in products, not returning it to the source immediately, if ever.</P><P> </P><P>[xvi]  $414 billion of externalized costs breaks down to: $314 billion in health-care costs, $38 billion in subsides, $37 billion in environmental costs, $21 billion in cruelty costs, $4 billion in fishing-related costs. Learn more by reading Meatonomics, by David Robinson Simon.</P><P> </P><P>[xvii]  On average, one acre of land of any level of fertility will be able to produce 15 to 18 times more protein from plant based sources than from animal products. Additionally, using any agricultural database regionally, nationally, or internationally, one can calculate that on average between 10 times and 100 times (in weight) more plant foods (vegetables, fruit, grain/nuts) on one acre of land than from animal products raised on that same acre of land, regardless of the level of fertility of that particular acre of land, presuming it is the same acre used for either product, animal or plant based.</P><P> </P><P>[xviii] Many organizations are studying humanity’s effect on soil degradation, erosion, and eventual desertification but not willing to emphasize the final connection of dots to animal agriculture. According to the UNCCD (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification), nearly 20 million acres of arable land is lost each year due to desertification and the primary reasons are:</P><P>1. deforestation due to cultivation of crops and pasture</P><P>2. overgrazing from livestock (“eating away grasses and eroding topsoil with hooves”)</P><P>3. intensive farming stripping away nutrients in soil</P><P><A href=""http://www.un.org/en/events/desertificationday/background.shtml"">http://www.un.org/en/events/desertificationday/background.shtml</A></P><P>Overgrazing by livestock is the principal land problem related to desertification as indicated in the article: <A href=""http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/docs/002-186/002-186.html"">http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/docs/002-186/002-186.html</A> And, according to the UNDDD: “Nearly 20% of the degrading land (globally) is cropland, and 20-25%, rangeland.” Understanding that over 70% of the global arable land used for agriculture is planted for crops grown for livestock, there is be ample support for the statement that “animal agriculture is the leading driver for approximately 1/3 of the land lost on earth due to desertification.” <A href=""http://www.un.org/en/events/desertification_decade/whynow.shtml"">http://www.un.org/en/events/desertification_decade/whynow.shtml</A></P><P> </P><P>[xix]   Few prominent scientists will openly proclaim the connection of their research findings with the need to eliminate animal agriculture or promotion of fully plant based nutrition. This is an observation that spans all aspects of global depletion related to food choice, including the topic of loss of biodiversity and extinction of species. </P><P>The statement that animal agriculture is the primary driver of biodiversity loss and extinction of species is supported by many discussions and interviews with leading authors and scientists working for the Convention of Biodiversity and IUCN as well as publications regarding current biodiversity assessments as presented by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the IUCN Red List, and the Global Environmental and Biodiversity Outlook.</P><P>Most organizations that associate their work with species and ecosystem/biodiversity concerns as well as the scientific community as a whole believe that the six main threats to our oceans are <mark>climate change</mark>, overfishing, predator loss, <mark>pollution</mark>, destruction of habitat, and bycatch, (“bykill”).</P><P>(For instance: The Species Survival Commission of the World Conservation Union and the Convention on Biological Diversity).</P><P>As of August 2012, the 2004 Global Species Assessment was the most recent empirical data on global extinction rates, based on birds, mammals, and amphibians. According to an interview conducted by Dr. Oppenlander with Simon Stuart, PhD, chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission:</P><P>“Habitat loss from grazing livestock and feed crops is far and away the most pervasive threat to terrestrial animal species, impacting 86 percent of all mammals, 88 percent of amphibians, and 86 percent of all birds. One in every eight birds, one in every three amphibians, and one in every four mammals is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the near future. Overexploitation of wild animals for consumption remains a second major factor for extinction, such as can be seen in bushmeat trade in Africa and Southeast Asia and all hunting endeavors on land, globally.” </P><P>The Alliance for Global Conservation estimates 36 percent of all species on our planet are in danger of extinction.</P><P>Scientists have divided our planet into 825 terrestrial “ecoregions” (as well as 450 freshwater and a number of oceanic ecoregions), each defined by its own distinct set of animal and plant species, as well as <mark>climate</mark>. Of all these land ecoregions, almost half are reported by lead scientists (interviews/discussions) to have livestock as a current threat. The World Conservation Union reported in 2010 that “most of the world’s endangered or threatened species” on their Red List (which lists the species that are most endangered) are suffering habitat loss due to livestock—not due to agriculture but to livestock.</P><P>The Convention on Biological Diversity, held in Nagoya, Japan, in October 2010 agreed that none of their goals from 2002 for lessening the rate of biodiversity loss were met. The attendees confirmed that the main pressures for the rapid loss of species—habitat change, overexploitation, <mark>pollution</mark>, invasive species, and <mark>climate change</mark>—were all increasing in intensity.</P><P>Current biodiversity assessments (as presented by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the IUCN Red List, and the Global Environmental and Biodiversity Outlook) now generally agree that land use change, modification of river flow, freshwater <mark>pollution</mark>, and exploitation of marine environments are the most significant drivers of biodiversity change and loss of species. Because more than 50% of the land use changes on Earth are related to livestock (ILRI), 70 to 90% of freshwater <mark>pollution</mark> in western countries (particularly the U.S. and China) can be traced back to animal agriculture, minimally 14.5% of anthropogenic GHG emissions/<mark>climate change</mark>, and 100% of “exploitation of marine environments” is related to the global commercial fishing industry, it can be safely and confidently demonstrated that “the primary driver of global species’ extinctions and loss of biodiversity is animal agriculture.” </P><P> </P><P>[xx] The amount of water, land and fuel used for differing diets varies greatly from the types of foods consumed, amount consumed and the geographical region where the food was raised. Taking into consideration that 1lb of beef requires upwards of 2500 gallons of water to produce compared to only 25 gallons for 1lb of wheat, the water footprint of a person consuming a high meat diet could be 100x greater than that of a person consuming only plant foods. The same applies for land and oil use. Many arid areas of the world can not support 1 cow per 2 acres and require 50+ acre per cow, compared to a crops such as potatoes that can produce 50,000lbs+ per acre. The energy/fuel inputs are similar. 1 calorie of beef can take 27x more energy to produce than soybeans. </P><P>xxi (New) As of 2016 the estimates of wild horses and burros has increased on the range to 67,027 and the amount of wild horses and burros in holding fcailities is more than 45,000. However the BLM considers the amount of wild horses and burros on the range too populated and will attempt to remove 40,000 to bring the level back to what is considered by the BLM the 'acceptable level'</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html"" data-block-type=""2"" id=""block-yui_3_17_2_15_1414543521348_68760""><DIV class=""sqs-block-content""><P style=""text-align:center""> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Delivery trucks also contribute substantially to the burden of fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, in the air, which is associated with many effects on human health.</P><P>Relatively little research has thoroughly traced the effects of online shopping on transportation networks. But a recent study in Newark, Delaware suggests that the knock-on effects of online shopping may worsen traffic congestion and transport-related <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.</P><P>Researchers at the University of Delaware conducted a survey of downtown Newark residents’ shopping habits and preferences and used the responses to calculate the quantity of goods purchased through home shopping.</P><P>They also got information from delivery companies about the number of trucks on the road and the number of packages per truck, and used this to determine how many delivery trucks are required to distribute home shopping purchases.</P><P>Finally, the researchers used transportation simulation software and data from local transportation authorities to determine the effect of delivery trucks on the transportation network, focusing on an area of downtown Newark that includes a portion of the university’s campus.</P><P>They conducted similar analyses in 2001, at the dawn of the online shopping era, and again in 2008. They reported their results <A href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504509.2015.1124471?journalCode=tsdw20"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">in a recent paper</A> in the International Journal of <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development &amp; World Ecology.</P><P>Curiously, the 2008 data suggested that home shopping in Newark had grown by only 14.8% since 2001. That’s much less than the researchers predicted in their earlier study. It also contrasts with data from other researchers showing that internet shopping increased six-fold between 2001 and 2011.</P><P>The researchers don’t offer any explanation for their unexpected finding. However, a large proportion of their survey respondents were university students, and the convenience of internet shopping may appeal more to people who are running a household.</P><P>Also, it’s significant that the researchers’ latest data are from 2008, which suggests that if anything their study underestimates the effect of home shopping on the transportation network.</P><P>In any case, the researchers found that even though home shopping by residents of Newark grew more slowly than anticipated, traffic in 2008 was worse than they had predicted.</P><P>An increase in the number of home shopping purchases increases travel time, traffic delays, and vehicle emissions of the transportation network as a whole, the researchers say.</P><P>While some previous studies suggest that e-commerce is associated with lower <mark>carbon</mark> emissions than traditional retail, other researchers have warned of a “rebound effect,” which occurs when gains in efficiency merely stimulate new consumption. Something similar may be going on in Newark, the results suggest.</P><P>“We found that the total number of vehicles miles travelled hasn’t decreased at all with the growth of online shopping,” says study leader Arde Faghri, professor of civil and environmental engineering and director of the Delaware Center for Transportation. “This suggests that people are using the time they save by shopping on the internet to do other things like eating out at restaurants, going to the movies, or visiting friends.” </P><DIV class=""submeta""><SPAN class=""submeta__label"">Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Enter the information <EM><STRONG>at least two weeks prior</STRONG></EM> to your event for best consideration. It may take up to a week to put it online, so please be patient. If you submit the event last minute, it unfortunately may not be published. If you submit multiple events not all may be published, but we try! Information must be entered in starred fields; others are optional. There is a limit of 250 characters in the text description. Please do not use exclamation points, or type in all capital letters. Remember to fill out the fields for date, time, and venue, if appropriate for your event. <EM><STRONG>Do not include prices, or any word related to cost, including the word 'free.' YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT MAY BE DECLINED if you include prices.</STRONG></EM> Write as if you were addressing a single person. All input is subject to approval and we reserve the right to edit any and all submissions. Please include the proper website, phone number or email address for people who want further information. If you have a question about your submission, please write <A href=""mailto:help@wmnf.org""> help@wmnf.org.</A>
WMNF reserves the right to publish, decline, or edit all Political Action submissions to protect our FCC &amp; Non-Profit status. All the other guidelines for submitting an event apply to Political Actions as well.

If this announcement is for a concert that’s not a benefit for a nonprofit organization, you can contact Laura Taylor to find out about being included on WMNF’s Concert Calendar, on-air and on our website. We have special rates for local bands: 
<A href=""mailto:laura@wmnf.org"">laura@wmnf.org</A> or 813-238-8001 x 132.  While we will post some concerts that are posted on the events page, for just a few dollars you can have your event highlighted, add a picture, and be in the concert calendar, which airs multiple times every week.
<STRONG>Community Announcement Guidelines</STRONG>
The Community Bulletin Board at WMNF is offered as a courtesy to non-profit organizations to broadcast events and fundraisers to listeners within the Tampa Bay region. For priority placement on the Community Bulletin Board, you must represent a 501(c)(3) or (4) IRS-designated organization. We will consider other arts and culture events offered free of charge to the public as space allows.

Sorry, WMNF does not do public service announcements for partisan political groups.
<STRONG>Record an announcement:</STRONG>
WMNF 88.5 FM invites nonprofit organizations to record a 30-second public service announcement for broadcast on 88.5. The guidelines are below.

The announcement must be for a registered nonprofit organization. Announcements are recorded with just voice, no music. A person from YOUR organization voices it. Since we’re non-commercial, announcements we can’t do a Call to Action for another organization. So you can’t say “come on down,” “don’t miss it,” “sign up now” or anything similar. But you can say, “You can go to (this website) for more information.” WMNF can’t announce prices, but you can direct people to a website or phone number for more information. And if it’s time-sensitive, we’d want to record that <EM><STRONG>at six weeks </STRONG></EM> before the date, so we have time to get things together and broadcast it for two weeks.

PSAs can be about what your group does and when you meet, or about a specific event you’re putting on. We’ll air one PSA at a time for each group, and the
station reserves the right to refuse announcements.

You can email a draft of your script to <A href=""mailto:nonprofitpsa@wmnf.org"">nonprofitpsa@wmnf.org</A> . Once your script is ready, we’ll find a good time for you or someone from your group to come to the station and record it.</LI><LI id=""field_5_1"" class=""gfield gfield_contains_required field_sublabel_below field_description_below gfield_visibility_visible""><LABEL class=""gfield_label gfield_label_before_complex"" for=""input_5_1_3"">Name<SPAN class=""gfield_required"">*</SPAN></LABEL></LI></FORM></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

However, all living things, including trees, must respire and “breathe” out <mark>CO2</mark> as well. It’s better to think of the rainforests as a force that counteracts global warming. Plants, such as the many millions of trees that make up the rainforest, take in <mark>CO2</mark> in order to make food via photosynthesis. This food is usually stored in the form of glucose, which is a <mark>carbon</mark>-rich sugar. Thus, the rainforest is a major contributor to <mark>carbon</mark> storage, and any <mark>carbon</mark> stored within the trees isn’t contributing to the greenhouse effect and warming the planet as a greenhouse gas.</P><P>However, degradation and deforestation releases the <mark>carbon</mark> stored within the trees back into the atmosphere at an alarming rate. About 30% of our <mark>carbon</mark> emissions come from burning the rainforests alone. According to a study published in Global Change Biology in 2014, forests that experienced disturbances such as logging and fires stored 40% less <mark>carbon</mark> than undisturbed forests.[1]What is degradation? The authors of the paper define anthropogenic forest degradation as “the reduction in the overall capacity of a forest to supply goods and services including <mark>carbon</mark> storage, <mark>climate</mark> regulation, and biodiversity conservation. It can result from various types of human disturbances, such as selective logging, understory fires, and overhunting.”1 Let’s look at one part of that definition: <mark>climate</mark> regulation. We know that when the trees store <mark>carbon</mark>, they’re keeping it out of the atmosphere, and when they are chopped down and decompose or are burned, that <mark>carbon</mark> is released back into the atmosphere. This <mark>carbon</mark> then functions as a greenhouse gas. <mark>Climate</mark> scientists Deborah Lawrence and Karen Vandecar recently released a paper that detailed the effects of deforestation on <mark>climate change</mark>. As deforestation increases, global warming is exacerbated, and global temperature increases and precipitation patterns are altered. What’s more, Amazonia is the region most affected by such effects of deforestation, and would experience a temperature increase of up to 3.8°C and a precipitation decrease of around 15% of annual rainfall if total deforestation were to occur.[2]The effects of <mark>climate change</mark> would wreak havoc on the ecosystems of the Amazon. Andean cloud forests, for example, are home to thousands of species that live nowhere else. Their habitat range is temperature-dependent, so as global temperatures increase, their habitable range moves upslope. However, in a 2013 paper on the implications for biodiversity loss with <mark>climate change</mark>, David Lutz pointed out that many of the species living in the cloud forests can’t keep pace with the change in habitat – their current pace of upslope migration “is around 2% of what it needs to be to stay in equilibrium with <mark>climate change</mark> by 2100.”[3] This means that unless humans give the migrating species a boost in their journey up the mountain by physically altering the environment to allow the seedlings to take hold (and give up our rate of fossil fuel consumption), many of these endemic species will go extinct – a huge loss for biodiversity.</P><P>The Amazon forest is a major player in determining global <mark>climate</mark>. It pulls the most important greenhouse gas from the air and puts it in storage. It transpires water, creating clouds that carry moisture around the world. It provides ecological services and is home to much of the world’s biodiversity. However, as the forest is degraded and destroyed, the power of the Amazon to mitigate global <mark>climate change</mark> is weakened, and it is adversely affected by the implications of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""et_pb_module et_pb_toggle et_pb_toggle_0 et_pb_toggle_item  et_pb_toggle_close""><H5 class=""et_pb_toggle_title"">References</H5></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Why ?</I></P><P><I> Well, read the interviews of editor-in-chief Dean Baquet</I><A href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/01/dean-baquet-addresses-nyts-republication-of-antisemitic-200788.html "" target=""_blank""><I>to know why</I></A><I>:</I></P><P><I> 'Here is how I made the call, and it wasn't easy. We have a standard that is pretty simple. We don't run things that are designed to gratuitously offend.'</I></P><P><I> 'Gratuitously offend'? What is offensive about Charlie's last cover? Depicting a bearded muslim, not even designated as Muhammad, with a sign 'I Am Charlie' and a message 'All Is Forgiven'? Drawn by a guy who had been shot at a week before by two Islamic turds and miraculously managed to survive? Offensive TO WHOM?</I></P><P><I> Well, we know. We know that the New York Times has not shied from publishing anti-semitic caricatures when those caricatures were news. And Baquet makes no bones about it:</I></P><P><I> 'Let's not forget the Muslim family in Brooklyn who read us and is offended by any depiction of what he sees as his prophet. I don't give a damn about the head of ISIS but I do care about that family and it is arrogant to ignore them.'</I></P><P><I> And Public Editor Margaret Sullivan adds: 'Ultimately, he decided against it, he said, because he had to consider foremost the sensibilities of Times readers, especially its Muslim readers. To many of them, he said, depictions of the prophet Muhammad are sacrilegious; those that are meant to mock even more so. We have a standard that is long held and that serves us well: that there is a line between gratuitous insult and satire. Most of these are gratuitous insult.'</I></P><P><I> So it's not that Baquet and the NYT are saying that Charlie's latest cover is particularly offensive or disrespectful. No, its only drawback it THAT IT IS. Not even 'a depiction of Muhammad'. No: a depiction of a bearded muslim that might be construed by some muslim reader in Brooklyn to be Muhammad.</I></P><P><I> What's the meaning of this? Some say that the NYT is simply scared, scared of being the target of Muslim fundamentalists if it publishes the Charlie cover. But it's not even that â€“ which would already be bad enough. It's worse.</I></P><P><I> It's that they have made the choice that they'd rather pander to the sensibilities of their muslim readership, in Brooklyn or elsewhere, than bring them the news. They have accepted that if their muslim readership thought a depiction of a bearded muslim who may be construed as Muhammad was offensive to them, then they would not show it to them, or anyone else.</I></P><P><I> And what in turn is the meaning of this? 'Islam' mean 'submission', you know. The New York Times has made the choice of submitting to the 'sensibilities' â€“ e.g., to the religious prejudices â€“ of its muslim readership. Nobody seems entirely aware of this but, in effect, THE NEW YORK TIMES HAS, OF ITS OWN CHOICE, DECIDED TO BECOME AN ISLAMIC NEWSPAPER.</I></P><P><I> So: all your prophecies are becoming true. And the irony is: NOT in France, NOT in Europe: in America alone.</I></P><P><I> Ed Reichenbach</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>~And finally, if you want to be reading the new eBook <I><mark>Climate Change</mark>: The Facts</I> within minutes, simply locate your friendly neighborhood digital bookstore below and click away:</P><P>For Amazon US, click <A href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S5L5Y0W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00S5L5Y0W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=steynonline-20&amp;linkId=ZKIZ4445ICP7W5MZ"">here</A>.</P><P>For Amazon UK, click <A href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00S5L5Y0W?*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0"">here</A>.</P><P>For Amazon Canada, click <A href=""http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00S5L5Y0W?*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0"">here</A>.</P><P>For Amazon Australia, click <A href=""http://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B00S5L5Y0W?*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0"">here</A>.</P><P>For Amazon India, click <A href=""http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00S5L5Y0W?*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0"">here</A>.</P><P>For Amazon Brazil, click <A href=""http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/B00S5L5Y0W?*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0"">here</A>.</P><P>For Amazon France, click <A href=""http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00S5L5Y0W?*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0"">here</A>.</P><P>For Amazon Germany, click <A href=""http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00S5L5Y0W?*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0"">here</A>.</P><P>For Amazon Italy, click <A href=""http://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B00S5L5Y0W?*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0"">here</A>.</P><P>For Amazon Japan, click <A href=""http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B00S5L5Y0W?*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0"">here</A>.</P><P>For Amazon Mexico, click <A href=""http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/B00S5L5Y0W?*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0"">here</A>.</P><P>For Amazon Netherlands, click <A href=""http://www.amazon.nl/gp/product/B00S5L5Y0W?*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0"">here</A>.</P><P>For Amazon Spain, click <A href=""http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B00S5L5Y0W?*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0"">here</A>.</P><P>For Kobo and Nook formats, you'll have to hold on a couple of days, but we will let you know.</P></DIV><P style=""clear:both; text-align:center;""><I>© 2018 Mark Steyn Enterprises (US) Inc.

Tree biomass stores <mark>carbon</mark> through photosynthesis, so deforestation contributes to <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. Tropical forests contain about 25% of the world’s <mark>carbon</mark>, and other forest regions of the world add another 20% of the world’s <mark>carbon</mark>. In just the Amazon basin, studies estimate that forests contain 90-140 billion tons of <mark>carbon</mark>, which could be equivalent to 9-14 decades of human <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. Previous statements by the IPCCC estimated tropical deforestation and land use change to contribute about 20% of global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, although more recent studies have placed this percentage closer to 10%. Nevertheless, <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from deforestation remain significant, a primary motivation behind the REDD+ mechanisms as an international <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation program. At the smaller level, forests affect local <mark>climate</mark> patterns; trees transpire water, so deforestation can reduce rainfall and contribute to desertification. Changes in local <mark>climate</mark> patterns can have significant impacts on food production, especially in rural tropical areas practicing subsistence agriculture and semi-arid tropical regions such as the Cerrado of Brazil.  Studies have found that since 1980, <mark>climate change</mark> resulted in declines in temperate corn and wheat yields, and mixed effects on soybean and rice yields.</P><P>Forests not only affect <mark>climate</mark>, but <mark>climate</mark> affects forests. At the global level, increased <mark>carbon</mark> could potentially benefit forest growth in a “fertilization” scenario, but <mark>climate change</mark> could also result in a rise in temperatures and increased water stress, causing a decrease in forest growth.  Studies in the Amazon basin predicts a “dieback” scenario, where a rise in temperature corresponds with a 10-20% reduction in rainfall, followed by change from forest ecosystems to savanna ecosystems. In this scenario, lower forest cover results in greater <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, less water retention, further drying, and a pernicious feedback cycle. Forest fires also alter the situation: fires induce drought and further emissions, although smoke facilitates cloud production and reduces surface temperatures. Some estimate the tipping point of this dieback scenario to occur when deforestation passes 40% of the Amazon basin (about double the present level). However, recent studies have found that rainforests may be more resilient to drought and changing <mark>climate</mark>, and may continue to store <mark>carbon</mark> longer.</P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> also affects many threatened species dependent on tropical forests. Globally, temperatures are likely to rise faster in polar regions than in tropical regions, affecting vulnerable species such as polar bears. In the tropics, however, rare species and isolated populations are also threatened, especially ones in sensitive environments such as islands, scrublands and forest canopy. In extreme heat waves in tropical Australia from 2003 to 2006, scientists documented high mortality of flying foxes. Tropical mountains are also extremely vulnerable; in many tropical regions, <mark>climate</mark> patterns associated with elevation gradients define species distributions. In the tropical Andes and Central America, amphibians are especially vulnerable to changing temperatures and reduced cloud cover. The golden toad from Monteverde, Costa Rica, was the first extinction attributed to <mark>climate change</mark>, in the early 1990s. Since then, scientists have documented the probable extinction of dozens of species of harlequin frogs, attributed to a synergy of the chytrid fungal disease and <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Many conservation programs address the issues of tropical forests and <mark>climate change</mark> through mitigation and adaption. The <A href=""/conservation/redd""><STRONG>REDD+ mechanism </STRONG></A>is the primary payment for ecosystem service mechanisms that uses international funding to stem deforestation and prevent <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. Adaptation programs include agroforestry systems and community forestry which provide forest communities with a diversity of alternatives to ensure economic revenue, food security, and <mark>sustainable</mark> forest management.  </P><DIV><P><STRONG>Read more about <mark>Climate Change</mark> in our tropical focal regions below: </STRONG></P><DIV><P><STRONG>Sources:</STRONG></P><P>Bonan, G.

In this same vein, several non-profit organizations, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”), the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”), the <mark>Climate</mark> Disclosure Standards Board (“CDSB”) and the International Integrated Reporting Counsel (“IIRC”), have developed voluntary sustainability reporting standards for issuers to consider. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) is currently seeking public comment in connection with its Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative on whether it should “increase or reduce the environmental disclosure required” in Regulation S-K, it is unclear whether any sustainability-related disclosures will be mandated. In the absence of an SEC rule requiring sustainability disclosures, shareholders seeking to influence corporate action on sustainability reporting, as well as on <mark>climate change</mark> and other environmental issues, have increasingly turned to shareholder proposals in an effort to achieve their goals. These proposals have come in various forms; while some proposals seek increased disclosure, other proposals target companies’ corporate governance regime by requesting the nomination of directors with expertise in environmental matters or linking executive compensation with sustainability criteria.</P><P>Shareholder proposals pertaining to environmental issues have become increasingly prevalent over the past five years. As of June 30, 2016, 90 environment-related proposals had been submitted to a vote at Russell 3000 companies this year, compared to 84 proposals in 2015 and 58 proposals in 2014. Despite this steady increase, however, environmental proposals have been overwhelmingly unsuccessful. Of the 90 proposals that have been voted on so far this year, only one proposal (or 0.1%) passed, while 89 proposals (or 99.9%) failed. This outcome is consistent with voting results in previous years; over the past five years, only two out of a total of 324 environmental proposals that reached a vote at Russell 3000 companies (or 0.6%) have passed. Additionally, thus far this year, shareholder proposals submitted to a vote at Russell 3000 companies received average shareholder support of 21.9%. This result is in line with the average support of 19.9% and 20.1% garnered by environmental shareholder proposals in 2015 and 2014, respectively.</P><P>Nonetheless, these proposals appear to be getting more traction, as companies seem to be more inclined to negotiate with proponents as compared to previous years.</P><H1 id=""i.-positions-of-the-proxy-advisory-firms"">I.

Policies</H3><P>As a general matter, ISS recommends a vote case-by-case on proposals addressing social or environmental issues, with the “overall principle” guiding its vote recommendations focusing on “whether the implementation of the proposals is likely to enhance or protect shareholder value.” In reaching its vote recommendations on social or environmental proposals, ISS also considers several enumerated factors, namely:</P><UL><LI>whether “the issues presented in the proposal are more appropriately or effectively dealt with through legislation or government regulation”;</LI><LI>whether “the company has already responded in an appropriate and sufficient manner to the issue(s) raised in the proposal”;</LI><LI>whether the request in the proposal is “unduly burdensome” in its scope or timeframe or is “overly prescriptive”;</LI><LI>how the company’s approach compares to “any industry standard practices for addressing the issue(s) raised by the proposal”; and</LI><LI>in cases where the proposal requests “increased disclosure or greater transparency, whether or not reasonable and sufficient information” is available to the company’s shareholders and “whether or not implementation would reveal proprietary or confidential information that could place the company at a competitive disadvantage.”</LI></UL><P>ISS also has distinct voting policies on various specific environmental issues. The most notable of these are discussed below.</P><H4 id=""<mark>climate</mark>-changegreenhouse-gas-ghg-emissions.""><mark>Climate Change</mark>/Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) Emissions.</H4><UL><LI><EM>Disclose information on risks of <mark>climate change</mark></EM>. ISS generally recommends a vote in favor of proposals that seek the disclosure of information on the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> to the company’s operations and investments, considering the following factors:
</LI><LI>whether the company already discloses current information “on the impact that <mark>climate change</mark> may have on the company as well as associated company policies and procedures to address related risks and/or opportunities”;</LI><LI>whether the company’s level of disclosure is comparable to that of industry peers; and</LI><LI>whether there are “no significant controversies, fines, penalties, or litigation associated with the company’s environmental performance.”</LI></UL><LI><EM>Report on GHG emissions</EM>. ISS also generally recommends a vote in favor of proposals requesting a report on GHG emissions from the company’s operations and/or products, unless:
</LI><LI>the company already discloses information on the potential impacts of GHG emissions on the company, as well as related company policies and procedures designed to address related risks and/or opportunities;</LI><LI>the company’s “level of disclosure is comparable to that of industry peers”; and</LI><LI>there are “no significant controversies, fines, penalties, or litigation associated with the company’s GHG emissions.”</LI><LI><EM>Adopt GHG reduction goals</EM>. ISS takes a case-by-case approach, however, on proposals calling for the adoption of GHG reduction goals from products and operations, taking into account the following factors:
</LI><LI>“whether the company provides disclosure of year-over-year GHG emissions performance data;</LI><LI>whether company disclosure lags behind industry peers;</LI><LI>the company’s actual GHG emissions performance;</LI><LI>the company’s current GHG emission policies, oversight mechanisms and related initiatives;</LI><LI style=""list-style: none;"">and</LI><LI>whether the company has been the subject of recent, significant violations, fines, litigation, or controversy related to GHG emissions.”</LI><H4 id=""sustainability-reporting."">Sustainability Reporting.</H4><P>ISS generally supports proposals requesting “that a company report on its policies, initiatives, and oversight mechanisms related to social, economic, and environmental sustainability,” unless “the company already discloses similar information” or “has formally committed to the implementation of a reporting program based on Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines or a similar standard within a specified time frame.”</P><H4 id=""renewable-energy."">Renewable Energy.</H4><P>ISS generally recommends a vote in favor of proposals requesting reports on “the feasibility of developing renewable energy resources,” unless the report would be duplicative of existing disclosure or irrelevant to the company’s business. ISS, however, generally recommends a vote against “proposals requesting that the company invest in renewable energy resources.” In ISS’s view, these decisions “are best left to management’s evaluation of the feasibility and financial impact that such programs may have on the company.”</P><H4 id=""general-environmental-proposals-and-community-impact-assessments."">General Environmental Proposals and Community Impact Assessments.</H4><P>ISS assesses, on a case-by-case basis, proposals requesting “reports on policies and/or the potential … environmental impact of company operations,” considering the following factors:</P><UL><LI>the company’s current disclosure of applicable policies and risk assessment reports, as well as risk management procedures;</LI><LI>the regulatory, legal or reputational impact of failing to “manage the company’s operations in question”;</LI><LI>the “nature, purpose, and scope of the company’s operations in the specific region(s)” in question;</LI><LI>the degree to which the company’s policies and procedures are “consistent with industry norms”; and</LI><LI>the scope of the proposal.</LI></UL><H4 id=""environmental-social-and-governance-esg-compensation-related-proposals."">Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Compensation-Related Proposals.</H4><P>ISS recommends voting case-by-case on “proposals to link, or report on linking, executive compensation to sustainability (environmental and social) criteria,” taking into account:</P><UL><LI>“the scope and prescriptive nature of the proposal”;</LI><LI>whether the company has significant and/or persistent controversies or regulatory violations regarding social and/or environmental issues;</LI><LI>whether the company has management systems and oversight mechanisms in place regarding its social and environmental performance;</LI><LI>the degree to which industry peers have incorporated similar non-financial criteria in their executive compensation practices; and</LI><LI>the company’s current level of disclosure regarding its environmental and social performance.”</LI></UL><H4 id=""changes-to-the-board-of-directors."">Changes to the Board of Directors.</H4><P>Shareholder proposals seeking to advance environmental causes may request that the board nominate a director with subject matter expertise or create a standing committee to oversee sustainability efforts. ISS recommends voting case-by-case on “proposals that establish or amend director qualifications,” considering “the reasonableness of the criteria and the degree to which they may preclude dissident nominees from joining the board.” ISS also recommends voting case-by-case on “resolutions seeking a director nominee who possesses a particular subject matter expertise, considering:</P><UL><LI>“the company’s board committee structure, existing subject matter expertise, and board nomination provisions relative to that of its peers;</LI><LI>the company’s existing board and management oversight mechanisms regarding the issue for which board oversight is sought;</LI><LI>the company’s disclosure and performance relating to the issue for which board oversight is sought and any significant related controversies;</LI><LI style=""list-style: none;"">and</LI><LI>the scope and structure of the proposal.”</LI></UL><P>In addition, ISS generally recommends voting against “proposals to establish a new board committee,” considering:</P><UL><LI>“existing oversight mechanisms,” “level of disclosure” and “company performance related to the issue for which board oversight is sought”;</LI><LI>“[b]oard committee structure compared to that of other companies in its industry sector; and</LI><LI>the scope and structure of the proposal.”</LI></UL><H4 id=""hydraulic-fracturing."">Hydraulic Fracturing.</H4><P>ISS generally recommends voting for proposals “requesting greater disclosure of a company’s (natural gas) hydraulic fracturing operations, including measures the company has taken to manage and mitigate the potential community and environmental impacts of those operations.” In determining its vote recommendation, ISS considers:</P><UL><LI>the company’s “current level of disclosure of relevant policies and oversight mechanisms” and how it compares to that of industry peers;</LI><LI>“potential relevant local, state, or national regulatory developments”;</LI><LI style=""list-style: none;"">and</LI><LI>“controversies, fines, or litigation related to the company’s hydraulic fracturing operations.”</LI></UL><H4 id=""recycling."">Recycling.</H4><P>ISS recommends voting case-by-case on “proposals to report on an existing recycling program, or adopt a new recycling program,” considering:</P><UL><LI>“the nature of the company’s business;</LI><LI>the current level of disclosure of the company’s existing related programs;</LI><LI>the timetable and methods of program implementation prescribed by the proposal;</LI><LI>the company’s ability to address the issues raised in the proposal; and</LI><LI>how the company’s recycling programs compare to similar programs of its industry peers.”</LI></UL><H3 id=""practice"">2. Practice</H3><P>Thus far this year, ISS has recommended a vote “For” 67 of 90 environment-related shareholder proposals (or 74.44%) submitted to a vote at Russell 3000 companies. ISS recommended a vote “For” an overwhelming majority of proposals related to sustainability reports, GHG emissions and <mark>climate change</mark>, with 13 out of 14 (or 92.86%), 13 out of 17 (or 76.47%), and 16 out of 22 (or 72.73%) proposals receiving a favorable recommendation, respectively. Notably, within the <mark>climate change</mark> category, ISS recommended a vote “Against” both “<mark>climate change</mark> action” proposals, which requested an increase in capital distributions to shareholders in light of <mark>climate change</mark> risks.</P><H2 id=""b.-glass-lewis"">B. Glass Lewis</H2><P>Glass Lewis’s proxy voting guidelines recognize that “day-to-day management and policy decisions, including those related to social, environmental or political issues, are best left to management and the board as they in almost all cases have more and better information about company strategy and risk.”</P><P>Glass Lewis will, however, favor “reasonable, well-crafted” shareholder proposals “when there is a clear link between the subject [of the proposal] and value enhancement or risk mitigation,” and, in Glass Lewis’s estimation, the company has not successfully addressed the issue. While discouraging the use of shareholder initiatives to “attempt to micromanage a company, its businesses or its executives,” Glass Lewis recognizes that, in some cases, these initiatives may serve to “protect shareholder value.”</P><P>Accordingly, Glass Lewis evaluates environment-related proposals “in the context of risk, on a case-by-case basis,” considering the following types of risk:</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Direct environmental and social risk,</STRONG> including “financial exposure to direct environmental risks associated with [the company’s] operations”;</LI><LI><STRONG>Risk due to legislation and regulation,</STRONG> i.e. “exposure to changes or potential changes in regulation that affect current and planned operations”;</LI><LI><STRONG>Legal and reputational risk,</STRONG> i.e., “the risk of damaging negative publicity and potentially costly legislation” resulting from “[f]ailure to take action on important environmental or social issues”; and</LI><LI><STRONG>Governance risk</STRONG>, i.e., the risk resulting from leadership that is ineffective or fails to thoroughly consider potential risks from environmental or social issues, which could ultimately lead to loss of shareholder value.</LI></UL><P>Glass Lewis also includes, in its proxy voting guidelines, policies regarding specific categories of environmental proposals. The most notable of these are discussed below.</P><H3 id=""<mark>climate</mark>-changeghg-emissions.""><mark>Climate Change</mark>/GHG Emissions.</H3><P>Glass Lewis considers recommending a vote in favor of “reasonably crafted proposals that request disclosure of a company’s <mark>climate change</mark> and/or [GHG] emission strategies” when:</P><UL><LI>the company “has suffered material financial impact from reputational damage, lawsuits or government investigations”;</LI><LI>“there is a strong link between <mark>climate change</mark> and its resultant regulation and shareholder value at the firm”;</LI><LI>the company “lags its peers regarding the requested disclosure or actions”; and/or</LI><LI>the company “has inadequately disclosed how it has addressed <mark>climate change</mark> risks.”</LI></UL><P>In addition, Glass Lewis considers supporting, on a case-by-case basis, “well-crafted proposals requesting that companies report their GHG emissions and adopt a reduction goal for these emissions[,] [p]articularly for companies operating in <mark>carbon</mark>- or energy-intensive industries.” In evaluating such proposals, Glass Lewis considers:</P><UL><LI>“the industry in which the company operates;</LI><LI>a lack of robust risk management of environmental issues as evidenced by material fines, lawsuits or reputational damage; and</LI><LI>whether a company’s peers have provided disclosure concerning their GHG emissions and future reduction goals.”</LI></UL><H3 id=""sustainability-and-environmentally-related-reports."">Sustainability and Environmentally-Related Reports.</H3><P>In its evaluation of proposals requesting that the company produce a sustainability or other “environmentally-related” report, Glass Lewis considers, among other factors:</P><UL><LI>the “financial risk to the company from its business operations”;</LI><LI>“the company’s current level of relevant disclosure;</LI><LI>the quality and comprehensiveness of sustainability information disclosed by the company’s peers;</LI><LI>the industry in which the company operates;</LI><LI>the company’s oversight of sustainability issues;</LI><LI>the level and type of sustainability concerns and controversies at the company;</LI><LI>the time frame within which the relevant report is to be produced; and</LI><LI>the level of flexibility granted to the board in implementing the proposal.”</LI></UL><P>Glass Lewis will consider recommending voting for “reasonably crafted proposals” requesting that companies “with significant exposure to sustainability-related risks,” such as those in extractive industries, produce “reports regarding the risks presented by their environmental and adverse effects on stakeholders that reduce shareholder value.” Glass Lewis will nonetheless evaluate these proposals, like all other environmental proposals, on a case-by-case basis.</P><H3 id=""renewable-energy.-1"">Renewable Energy.</H3><P>When evaluating “proposals requesting an action or disclosure related to renewable energy or energy efficiency,” Glass Lewis will take into account:</P><UL><LI>“current energy regulations facing the company and their attendant risks to its operations; o the company’s responsiveness to issues related to energy efficiency and renewable energy; o the company’s current disclosure on this issue; and</LI><LI>whether the company’s actions and disclosure are aligned with that of its peers.”</LI></UL><P>Glass Lewis may consider recommending a vote in favor of “well-crafted” proposals that seek “increased disclosure of renewable energy strategies or efforts toward increased energy efficiency,” where:</P><UL><LI>“there is credible evidence of egregious or illegal behavior regarding the company’s energy strategy or actions in this regard;</LI><LI>the company has been largely unresponsive to shifting regulatory changes related to energy policies; or</LI><LI>adoption of the requested disclosure will clearly lead to an increase in or the protection of shareholder value.”</LI></UL><P>Glass Lewis, however, is “not inclined to support proposals requesting the adoption of renewable energy goals or proposals seeking the implementation of prescriptive policies related to energy efficiency or renewable energy.”</P><H3 id=""executive-compensation."">Executive Compensation.</H3><P>With regard to proposals that request tying executive compensation to environmental or social practices, Glass Lewis will:</P><UL><LI>“review the target firm’s compliance with (or contravention of) applicable laws and regulations”;</LI><LI>“examine any history of environmentally and socially related concerns, including those resulting in material investigations, lawsuits, fines and settlements”; and</LI><LI>“review the firm’s current compensation policies and practices.”</LI></UL><P>As a general matter, however, Glass Lewis believes that “the selection of performance metric for executive compensation … should be left to the compensation committee.”</P><H1 id=""ii.-positions-of-large-institutional-shareholders"">II. Positions of Large Institutional Shareholders</H1><P>Large institutional shareholders have not uniformly provided explicit guidance as to their voting policies on environment-related proposals. The voting guidelines of Fidelity, Vanguard and BlackRock, for example, do not reference environmental proposals. Additionally, institutional investors’ policies on environmental proposals are usually broad in scope and do not necessarily address how a specific proposal will be evaluated. Because environmental proposals tend to be specific, it can be difficult to discern how these institutional investors will respond to any given proposal. State Street Global Advisors, for example, addresses environmental proposals in its voting guidelines, indicating that it is chiefly concerned the financial and economic implications of environmental issues. According to its voting principles, State Street “encourages companies to be transparent about the environmental and social risks and opportunities they face and adopt robust policies and processes to manage such issues.” State Street evaluates shareholder proposals related to environmental and social risks on an issuer by issuer basis, with the understanding that “environmental and social risks can vary widely depending on a company, its industry, operations, and geographic footprint.”</P><H1 id=""iii.-environmental-proposals-trends"">III. Environmental Proposals Trends</H1><H2 id=""a.-overall-trends"">A. Overall Trends</H2><UL><LI><STRONG>The number of environment-related shareholder proposals submitted to a vote has been steadily increasing, reaching a high this year.</STRONG> The number of proposals relating to environmental issues has increased meaningfully in recent years, with 90 proposals reaching a vote during the first six months of 2016 (with one proposal pending as of June 30), as compared to 84 proposals in 2015 and 58 proposals in 2014. The number of proposals submitted to a vote this year represents a 114.3% increase in the number of environmental proposals submitted to a vote from 2012.</LI></UL><UL><LI><STRONG>Consistent with previous years, the overwhelming majority of environmental proposals failed this year.</STRONG> Only one of the 90 environmental proposals (or 0.1%) to reach a vote this year at Russell 3000 companies passed. Of the 324 environmental proposals that reached a vote over the past five years, only two (or 0.62%) garnered majority support—one in 2013 and one in 2016. Both proposals requested the production of sustainability reports.</LI><LI><STRONG>Average shareholder approval rates for environmental proposals remained low, consistent with prior years.</STRONG> During the 2016 proxy season, shareholder proposals submitted to a vote at Russell 3000 companies received average shareholder support of 21.9%.

Although shareholders voted against environmental proposals in each of the 23 cases in which ISS opposed the proposal, this result appears to be consistent with shareholders’ general approach toward these proposals and is unlikely the result of ISS’s recommendation.</LI><LI><STRONG>The most prevalent type of environmental proposal this proxy season related to <mark>climate change</mark>, followed by proposals pertaining to GHG emissions.</STRONG> At Russell 3000 companies, 22 <mark>climate change</mark> proposals and 18 GHG proposals were submitted to a vote in 2016. These included two innovative “<mark>climate change</mark> action” proposals that requested an increase in the return of capital to shareholders in light of <mark>climate change</mark> risks.

responsible” investors submitted the vast majority of environmental proposals.</STRONG> “Socially responsible” investors submitted 43 (or 47.8% of) shareholder proposals on environmental matters that reached a vote at Russell 3000 companies so far this season. Among these, Calvert Asset Management submitted the greatest number of environmental proposals, submitting eight (or 8.9% of) such proposals. The single proponent that submitted the largest number of environmental proposals, however, was As You Sow Foundation, which submitted 18 (or 20% of) proposals, followed by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, which submitted 11 (or 12.2% of) proposals.</LI></UL><H2 id=""b.-successful-proposal-clarcor-inc."">B. Successful Proposal: CLARCOR, Inc.</H2><P>This proxy season, there was only one successful environmental shareholder proposal. The proposal, submitted to CLARCOR, Inc. by Walden Asset Management, requested that the company “issue a report describing [its] present policies, performance and improvement targets related to key environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals.” The proposal further provided that the report should be disclosed by the end of 2016.</P><P>Management recommended that shareholders vote against this proposal, claiming that the proponent had unsuccessfully submitted similar proposals in 2014 and 2015 and that preparing a sustainability report would “involve significant expense and would not be an efficient use of our limited financial and human resources.” Furthermore, the company argued that its larger peers that issue sustainability reports are substantially larger and have significantly greater resources than CLARCOR. Despite management’s opposition, the proposal passed, receiving shareholder support of 54.5%.</P><P>This was the third consecutive year in which CLARCOR received a sustainability reporting proposal. In 2015, the sustainability reporting proposal received shareholder support of 39.2%, while in 2014 it received shareholder support of 33.1%. ISS recommended a vote “For” the proposal in all three years. Glass Lewis, however, had previously opposed the measure, but in 2016, the proxy advisory firm supported it, possibly helping to swing the vote.</P><H1 id=""iv.-sec-no-action-letters"">IV. SEC No-Action Letters</H1><P>As of June 30, 2016, 26 no-action requests have been decided this proxy season by the SEC staff (the “Staff”) with regard to shareholder proposals on environmental issues. A total of 11 requests were granted and 13 were denied on substantive grounds. The no-action requests granted on substantive grounds were decided based on one of the following exclusionary rules:</P><UL><LI>Rule 14a-8(i)(1)—The proposal is not a proper subject for action by shareholders under the laws of the jurisdiction of the company’s organization (one no-action letter granted).</LI><LI>Rule 14a-8(i)(7)—The proposal relates to the company’s ordinary business operations (seven no-action letters granted).</LI><LI>Rule 14a-8(i)(10)—The company has already substantially implemented the proposal (one no-action letter granted).</LI><LI>Rule 14a-8(i)(12)—The proposal is substantially similar to a proposal submitted in prior years which did not receive sufficient shareholder support for resubmission (two no-action letters granted).</LI></UL><P>In 2014, Glass Lewis recommended a vote against the proposal, explaining, among other things, that although it “would like to see more specific disclosure regarding the Company’s sustainability initiatives,” it “[did] not believe that proponent ha[d] sufficiently demonstrated that the Company’s current practices [at the time] present[ed] a threat to shareholder value.” Furthermore, the Company did not have any “recent high-profile environmental and social controversies,” and it relatively “align[ed] with its peers regarding disclosure.” Glass Lewis repeated its recommendation in 2015, noting that though a similar proposal received “significant shareholder support” of 40% in 2014, it was still “not convinced that adoption of this proposal [was] necessary at [the] time or that shareholders would derive significant benefit from the production of the requested report.” In 2016, however, Glass Lewis recommended a vote in favor of the proposal because “it would signal responsiveness to shareholders” and “would be in the best long-term interest of the Company and its shareholders.” In addition to noting that “there is room for improvement” in the company’s current disclosure, Glass Lewis explained that although 40% and 45.2% of shareholders supported this proposal in 2014 and 2015, respectively, “the Company made no meaningful improvements to its report or disclosure over the last year.” Glass Lewis expressed concern that this might “indicate a level of unresponsiveness to shareholder concerns.”</P><H2 id=""a.-improper-under-state-law-under-rule-14a-8i1-nextera-energy"">A. Improper Under State Law under Rule 14a-8(i)(1): NextEra Energy</H2><P>During the 2016 proxy season, one company submitted a no-action request to the SEC arguing that the shareholder proposal it had received was not a proper subject for action by shareholders under state law. The shareholder proposal at issue, which was submitted to NextEra Energy, Inc., requested that the company “report material risks and costs of sea level rise to company operations, facilities, and markets based on a range of [sea level rise] scenarios projecting forward to 2100, according to best available science.” In its no-action request, NextEra argued that the proposal was not a proper subject for action by shareholders under Florida law because the proposal “is not cast as a recommendation or request but as a mandatory proposal that would be binding upon the Company if approved,” in contravention of the discretionary power of the board under state law. The Staff concurred but noted that “this defect could be cured … if the proposal were recast as a recommendation or request to the board of directors.” Accordingly, the Staff concluded that it would not recommend enforcement action unless the proponent revised the proposal within seven days.</P><H2 id=""b.-ordinary-business-operations-under-rule-14a-8i7-general-electric-ball-corporation-dunkin-brands-group-amazon.com-the-tjx-companies-cvs-health-corporation-and-duke-energy-corporation"">B. Ordinary Business Operations under Rule 14a-8(i)(7): General Electric, Ball Corporation, Dunkin’ Brands Group, Amazon.com, The TJX Companies, CVS Health Corporation and Duke Energy Corporation</H2><P>By far, the most popular ground on which issuers requested no-action relief from the Staff with regard to environmental proposals this year was Rule 14a-8(i)(7), which permits the exclusion of shareholder proposals that deal with “a matter relating to the company’s ordinary business operations.” Fifteen companies faced with environmental shareholder proposals submitted seventeen no-action requests to the SEC on this basis, seven of which were successful. Notably, the Staff appears to consider <mark>climate change</mark> and GHG emissions to be “significant policy issues,” thereby precluding no-action relief under Rule 14a-8(i)(7) for proposals relating to GHG emissions or requesting <mark>climate change</mark> reports or action.</P><P>Accordingly, the Staff did not grant no-action relief this year with regard to any such proposals under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</P><H3 id=""general-electric-company-ge."">General Electric Company (GE).</H3><P>GE received a shareholder proposal requesting that the company “undertake an independent evaluation and prepare an independent report by October 2016, demonstrating that the company has assessed all potential sources of liability related to [Polychlorinated Biphenyl] discharges in the Hudson River … and offering conclusions on the most responsible and cost-effective way to address them.” In its no-action request, GE asserted that this proposal relates to the company’s ordinary business operations because it would substitute the board’s judgment with that of the shareholders on decisions involving litigation strategy with regard to an ongoing litigation and because it interferes with the company’s legal compliance program by putting shareholders in a position to evaluate its effectiveness. The SEC granted no-action relief, specifically noting that the proposal would “affect the conduct of ongoing litigation to which the company is a party.”</P><H3 id=""ball-corporation."">Ball Corporation.</H3><P>The shareholder proposal submitted to Ball Corporation requested that the company “issue a report (by October 2016, at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information) reviewing the Company’s policies, actions, and plans to reduce [bisphenol-A (‘BPA’)] use in its products and set quantitative targets to phase out the use of BPA, in light of reputational and regulatory risks.” In its request for no-action relief, Ball Corporation argued that this proposal deals with matters relating to the company’s ordinary business operations because it “seeks to influence the Company’s development, manufacture and sale of its packaging products, which comprise the core of the Company’s packaging business.” The SEC concurred, noting that the proposal “relates to Ball’s product development.”</P><H3 id=""dunkin-brands-group-inc."">Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc.</H3><P>The shareholder proposal received by Dunkin’ Brands requested that the company “issue a public report describing the company’s short- and long-term strategies on water use management specifically related to toilets in the retail facilities.” In its no-action request, Dunkin’ argued that this proposal is excludable pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(7), among other exclusionary provisions. The company asserted that the proposal would involve a “direct interjection into the Company’s relationship with its customers, the franchisees, which is a crucial component of [its] day-to-day business operations.” The company took the position that the proposal seeks to micro-manage this relationship and, in particular, the company’s ongoing efforts to “assist its franchisees in building more <mark>sustainable</mark> restaurants” through the DD Green Achievement Program, a certification program for franchisees. Furthermore, the company claimed that the proposal “focuses on the specific issue of water consumption by toilets, which is not a significant policy issue that transcends the company’s day-to-day business operations.” The Staff granted no-action relief pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</P><H3 id=""amazon.com-inc."">Amazon.com, Inc.</H3><P>Amazon received a shareholder proposal seeking a report “on the company’s policy options to reduce potential <mark>pollution</mark> and public health problems from electronic waste generated as a result of its sales to consumers, and to increase the safe recycling of such wastes.” The company argued that this proposal is excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(7) because it requests that Amazon.com “offer a specific service (to assist in recycling customers’ discarded electronics” and that it “revise its policies regarding products it sells.” The company further asserted that the proposal “relates to [its] customer relations efforts.” The Staff concurred that “the proposal relates to the company’s products and services and does not focus on a significant policy issue.”</P><H3 id=""the-tjx-companies-and-cvs-health-corporation."">The TJX Companies and CVS Health Corporation.</H3><P>The proposals received by The TJX Companies and CVS Health Corporation requested that senior management “set company-wide quantitative targets by November 2016 to increase renewable energy sourcing and/or production.”</P><P>The TJX Companies argued that the proposal is excludable because it “concerns the Company’s management of energy expenses” and establishes a deadline of five months, which is “unjustifiably short, arbitrary and inappropriately seeks to dictate the allocation of the Company’s human and financial resources.” Similarly, CVS maintained that the proposal relates to its ordinary business operations by: “(1) focusing on cost-saving measures and the day-to-day financial management of the Company and (2) micro-managing (a) the deadline … and (b) the manner in which the Company chooses to pursue … environmentally-friendly initiatives.” In both cases, the Staff agreed that the proposal may properly be excluded under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</P><H3 id=""duke-energy-corporation."">Duke Energy Corporation.</H3><P>The proposal submitted to Duke Energy requested that “a committee of the Board of Directors oversee a study of the potential future impact of changes in the electric utility industry, and prepare a report on how to meet these challenges and protect shareholder value” by September 2016. The company argued that the proposal concerns its ordinary business decisions of products and services offered, since it focuses on Duke’s “consideration of which alternative energy sources to offer” and “choice of technologies,” therefore attempting to impermissibly micro-manage its business. The Staff granted no-action relief pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</P><H2 id=""c.-substantial-implementation-under-rule-14a-8i10-dominion-resources"">C. Substantial Implementation under Rule 14a-8(i)(10): Dominion Resources</H2><P>Eight companies sought to exclude ten environmental shareholder proposals this year pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(10), which permits the exclusion of a proposal if the company had already substantially implemented it. Only one such company, Dominion Resources, Inc., was successful.</P><P>The proposal received by Dominion Resources requested that the company’s board publish a report on how the company is “measuring, mitigating, setting reduction targets, and disclosing methane emissions.” In its no-action request, Dominion Resources took the position that it had substantially implemented the proposal through its publicly available <EM>Methane Management Report 2015</EM>, which describes the company’s practices related to methane emissions and thus “compares favorably with the guidelines in the Proposal.” The company further asserted that, in addition to mandatory disclosures, it makes various voluntary disclosures that address its GHG emissions, including in its 2014 Greenhouse Gas Report. The SEC agreed that the company’s actions “compare favorably with the guidelines of the proposal” and thus granted no-action relief under Rule 14a-8(i)(10).</P><H2 id=""d.-resubmission-under-rule-14a-8i12-wal-mart-stores-inc.-and-chevron-corporation"">D. Resubmission under Rule 14a-8(i)(12): Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Chevron Corporation</H2><P>During the 2016 proxy season, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Chevron Corporation requested three no-action letters on the ground that an environmental shareholder proposal they had received was substantially similar to a previous shareholder proposal that was submitted to a vote at the company but did not receive the requisite shareholder support for resubmission under Rule 14a-8(i)(12). Two of these requests were successful.</P><P>The shareholder proposal submitted to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. urged the company to “set quantitative goals, based on current technologies, for reducing total greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions produced by the international marine shipping of products sold in Walmart’s stores and clubs” and “to report to shareholders by December 31, 2016 … regarding the goals and steps Walmart plans to take to achieve them.” In its no-action request, Wal-Mart explained that the proposal was nearly identical to a proposal that was included in its 2015 proxy materials. The company indicated that the proposal submitted to a vote in 2015 received a mere 1.75% of the vote. Accordingly, the company asserted, the proposal “did not receive the support necessary for resubmission” under rule 14a-8(i)(12)(i), which permits exclusion where the proposal deals with substantially the same subject as another proposal in the preceding five years and received less than 3% of the vote. Concurring that the 2015 proposal “deal[t] with substantially the same subject matter,” and the Staff granted the company no-action relief.</P><P>Chevron Corporation similarly requested no-action relief under Rule 14a-8(i)(12), though under a separate provision thereof, which permits the exclusion of a proposal dealing with substantially the same subject matter as a proposal that received “[l]ess than 10% of the vote on its last submission to shareholders if proposed three times or more previously within the preceding 5 calendar years.” The proposal submitted to Chevron Corporation in 2016 requested that the company prepare a report that includes:</P><P>“a) The numbers of all offshore oil wells… that Chevron Corporation owns or has a partnership in
b) Current and projected expenditures for remedial maintenance and inspection of out-of-production wells
c) Cost of research to find effective containment and reclamation following marine oil spills.”</P><P>Chevron argued that this proposal deals with “substantially the same subject matter” as at least three previous shareholder proposals submitted to a vote at the company in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and that, on its last submission, the proposal “did not receive the support necessary for resubmission.” Given that the previously submitted proposals were virtually identical, the Staff found that “proposals dealing with substantially the same subject matter were included in Chevron’s proxy materials for meetings held in 2013, 2012 and 2011.” Indicating that “the 2013 proposal received only 7.25 percent” support during its last submission to shareholders in 2013, the Staff concurred that Chevron may exclude the proposal under Rule 14a-8(i)(12)(iii).</P><H1 id=""v.-takeaways"">V. Takeaways</H1><P>Although environmental shareholder proposals are increasingly prevalent, they are rarely successful. If faced with a shareholder proposal related to <mark>climate change</mark>, sustainability or other environmental issues, management should consider whether it is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders to attempt to negotiate exclusion of the proposal through the substantial implementation of the proposal’s request or to submit the proposal to a shareholder vote. If management determines not to negotiate with the proponent (or if negotiations are unsuccessful), and if no-action relief is either unlikely to be granted or is denied, management should bear in mind that proposals of this nature are unlikely to receive majority support.</P><P>The complete publication, including footnotes, is available <A href=""http://www.stblaw.com/docs/default-source/memos/firmmemo_08_08_16_environmental-proposals.pdf"" target=""_blank"" class=""external"" rel=""nofollow"">here</A>.</P><DIV class=""hatom-extra"" style=""display:none;visibility:hidden;""><SPAN class=""entry-title""><mark>Climate Change</mark>, Sustainability and Other Environmental Proposals</SPAN><SPAN class=""published""> 2016-09-06T09:52:37-04:00</SPAN><SPAN class=""updated""> 2016-09-06T09:52:37-04:00</SPAN><SPAN class=""author vcard""><SPAN class=""fn"">Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation</SPAN></SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The report stated that &quot;it takes a tremendous amount of energy to manufacture and power our devices, data centers, and related infrastructural needs. The energy footprint of the IT sector is already estimated to consume approximately 7% of global electricity&quot;

The report scored 15 global internet companies and gave them a grade between A (the top) and F. The score was based on:

- Percentage of coal, nuclear and gas used to generate electricity
- Transparency on energy use
- Commitment to renewable energy use
- Energy efficiency and green house gas mitigation strategies
- Renewable energy procurement
- Proactive advocacy

Amazon Web Services (AWS) received an overall score of C, this put it roughly in the middle of the table - three other companies were given a C and six companies gained a higher score. AWS’s lowest score was for transparency (F) the report stated “AWS’ greatest barrier to earning the confidence of its customers in its 100% renewable energy goal continues to be its lack of transparency.” It earned its highest score (B) for Renewable Energy Advocacy and was praised for using its influence to push for renewable energy policy. It was given Cs for Renewable Energy Procurement and Energy Efficiency &amp; <mark>Pollution</mark> Management and a D for Renewable Energy Commitment &amp; Siting Policy. The report highlighted the concern that AWS’ rapid growth was outstripping its increases in renewable electricity use.</P><SMALL>Greenpeace Campaign Report:Greenpeace Click Clean Report update (January 2017)</SMALL></DIV><DIV><H4><mark>Climate</mark> Counts rated 'stuck'</H4><P>In 2015 Ethical Consumer viewed the <mark>Climate</mark> Count's website www.<mark>climate</mark>counts.org.

The prize is eye-catching — potentially 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in investment. Cities, including Chicago, have stampeded to join the race.</P><P>Amazon has listed some of the things it wants — a big city, a good business <mark>climate</mark>, a smart labor force. But the biggest factor has been left unsaid. <mark>Climate change</mark> has simply made many cities too risky.</P><P>In the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Amazon has to ask itself: How can it ensure its new headquarters are safe when the next megastorm ravages a great American city?</P><P>Chicago stands alone in offering much of what Amazon wants while avoiding the one thing it can’t accept — citywide <mark>devastation</mark>. Chicago, like every place on Earth, faces clear and real impacts and challenges from <mark>climate change</mark>. But the challenges to many other cities are simply much worse.</P><P>Admittedly, this is an awkward conversation, particularly now. It sounds like Chicago is exploiting the misery of Houston or Miami. Well, that’s one way of putting it. But it seems fair to point out that Amazon would be rash to ignore the growing threat of <mark>climate change</mark> and Chicago would be wise to note that it is a haven from this threat.</P><P><A id=""PEBSL000379"" title=""Jeff Bezos"" href=""/topic/business/consumer-goods-industries/jeff-bezos-PEBSL000379-topic.html"">Jeff Bezos</A> has built Amazon with a maniacal focus on “long-term thinking,” one of the four guiding principles that drive the company. In the very long term, a stronger effort to prevent risk from storms enhanced by <mark>climate change</mark> is vital. But Amazon’s proposal notes that it is thinking “beyond 2027,” and in that time frame, <mark>climate change</mark> and these storms are going to get only worse.</P><P>This is the cold calculation that Amazon must now make.</P><P>In looking toward and beyond 2027, truly dangerous risks are found in cities across the country, including some bidding for that Amazon bonanza.</P><P>Coastal cities face extraordinary threats from sea level rise and from water-driven hurricanes. The <A id=""ORGOV000265"" title=""World Bank Group"" href=""/topic/business/world-bank-group-ORGOV000265-topic.html"">World Bank</A> ranked cities at the highest economic risk from <mark>climate change</mark>-related flooding.

Drought and heat, for instance, will plague the nation. A recent study in Science magazine, analyzing economic risks from <mark>climate change</mark>, found the greatest risk comes from deaths caused by heat waves.

Hurricane Irma, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in recorded history, hit the islands of the northeast Caribbean on Sept. 6, 2017, before roaring along a path to Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Florida.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P>Chicago’s position is instructive. The city suffered a deadly heat wave in 1995, but in the decades since, it has worked to become more resilient to heat. Measures from community outreach to neighborhood cooling centers are in place.</P><P>In other words, heat waves, like blizzards, will happen here again. But the city knows how to handle heat and snow, and keep running. No seacoast city plagued by hurricanes can say that.</P><P>Neither can any West Coast city astride an earthquake fault line. No company wants to put 50,000 of its employees in a city that might be hit by the next Big One. Already, more and more companies are putting data centers here, because they know they are supersecure.</P><P>The word is beginning to get around. Weather.com listed the 25 cities most likely to be affected by <mark>climate change</mark>. Chicago wasn’t on the list. But it was on a New York Times list of the best American places to live to avoid the threats of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>In a world fixated on <mark>climate change</mark>, Chicago is more than just a safe haven. In its announcement, Amazon said it was the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in 2016. In driving down <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, Amazon will find a forceful partner in Chicago, a city that is committed to the Paris <mark>climate</mark> goals and to powering its operations with renewable energy.</P><P>As everyone knows, Chicago’s biggest problem is human, not climatic. It is a city split between the high-tech talent that Amazon wants and the despairing young people caught in the warfare that plagues its poorest neighborhoods. Well, Jeff Bezos loves a challenge. As Amazon hires its team, it can offer partnership and pathways to the many Chicagoans left behind. If Chicago can solve Amazon’s problem, perhaps Amazon can be a player in solving Chicago’s epidemic of violence and inequality.</P><P>Amazon’s Oct. 19 proposal deadline is rapidly approaching. The selected city must check the main boxes that Amazon requires. Chicago is doing that right now.</P><P>In this world of turbocharged storms, however, an unwritten factor has seeped into the discussion.</P><P>Is the city at risk?</P><P>In choosing Chicago, Amazon will answer that question now while it works to ensure that more cities check that box in the future.</P><P><EM>Karen Weigert, a senior fellow on global cities at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, served as Chicago’s first chief sustainability officer from 2011 to 2016.

For example, Amazon could very well be scrutinized for its need for vast amounts of transportation resources and packaging materials. Also, as the company continues to develop and produce more and more private label products, the public may consider the environmental cost of producing those products. Likewise, the various suppliers and sellers utilizing the Amazon marketplace could face similar challenges.</P><P>AWS requires considerable energy consumption. This dependence on energy production could entail massive future costs in the event of rising energy prices as well as in potentially negative public perception if Amazon’s power mix skews towards traditional energy sources. However, Amazon is also facing a significant opportunity in that the use of centralized data centers (e.g. AWS) is far more cost effective and energy efficient for corporate clients. Corporate clients under pressure to become more environmentally friendly would likely be more inclined to consider a transition towards off-premise solutions.</P><P><STRONG><EM> </EM></STRONG></P><P><STRONG><EM>Steps Taken</EM></STRONG></P><P>Amazon has gone to great lengths to consider its role in energy efficiency and is actively engaged across a number of fronts to reduce both its, and its clients’, environmental impact.</P><P>In its marketplace business, Amazon has sustainability efforts on packaging and process improvement. Recently, Amazon has introduced “frustration-free packaging” that is 100% recyclable. Amazon states that most orders are shipped in corrugated packaging that is fully recyclable and is composed of 43% reclaimed materials. The company has also started working with other suppliers and vendors on its platform to provide free analysis and advice around packaging <mark>innovation</mark> with the ultimate goal of reducing resource needs. In addition to packaging efforts, Amazon has introduced a sustainability bent to its Kaizen Program. Under Kaizen, employees are encouraged to consider continuous improvement opportunities, including energy efficiencies and opportunities to reduce consumption. For example, employees redesigned the process by which trucks were filled with product ready to ship. The reconfiguration of product layout increased truck capacity by 20%, decreasing the net need for transport. Another example includes the selective operation of conveyors and lights based on employee presence and usage in lieu of continuous operations</P><P>Other efforts include Amazon’s emphasis on <mark>sustainable</mark> buildings and preference for LEED-certified facilities and Amazon Green, a cross-category program that includes a customer-generated list of the ‘best’ green products available on Amazon.</P><P>Amazon’s AWS business has confirmed a long-term commitment to achieve 100% renewable energy use for its global infrastructure footprint. Amazon sees three levers in regards to efficient power consumption: the number of servers running, the energy required to power each server, and the energy input type of each server. The company notes that in general, cloud solutions (e.g. AWS) consume 84% less power vs. on-premises solutions. This is driven primarily by two factors: large-scale server farms generally achieve 65% utilization vs. 15% utilization of on-prem solutions; and dated on-premise solutions are 29% less efficient in energy usage for comparable computing resources. Also, even as they consume less energy as compared to the technologies they’re replacing, AWS also uses a ‘less-dirty’ power mix, stating that their inputs are 28% less <mark>carbon</mark> intense. In 2015, 25% of power consumed by AWS was renewable, with a goal of 40% in 2016. To achieve this, Amazon has started to build/acquire their own power generation facilities. Amazon owns solar and wind farms across the US generating 1,660,000 megwatts of power annually (the equivalent power consumption of all homes in Cleveland, Ohio)</P><P><STRONG><EM> </EM></STRONG></P><P><STRONG><EM>Additional Steps to Consider</EM></STRONG></P><P>Although Amazon’s efforts thus far have been commendable, there are a number of other steps they should consider:</P><UL><LI>Investing in additional power generation sources</LI><LI>Fulfillment efficiency and alternative means of fulfillment, in-housing logistics</LI><LI>Energy-efficient production of low impact, private label products</LI><LI>Leveraging supplier power to enable market-based influence of production</LI><LI>Incentivizing sale and use of energy efficient, low impact, products in new and emerging markets.

material terms of the performance goals, as amended, in the 1997 Plan. Approval of the material terms of the performance goals is a condition for certain awards made under the 1997 Plan to qualify as tax-deductible performance-based compensation
under Section 162(m) of the Code. The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter is required to approve the amended and restated plan,
including material terms of the performance goals. Broker nonvotes will have no effect on the outcome of this matter. Abstentions will be counted as present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of this matter and will have the effect of a vote against
the approval of the amended and restated plan. </FONT></P><P style=""margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%""><FONT style=""font-family:Times New Roman"" size=""2"">Section 162(m) places a limit of $1 million on the amount the Company may
deduct in any one year for compensation paid to a covered employee, which means any person who as of the last day of the fiscal year is the chief executive officer or one of the Companys three highest compensated executive officers
other than the CFO, as determined under SEC rules. There is, however, an exception to this limit on deductibility for compensation that satisfies certain conditions for qualified performance-based compensation set forth under
Section 162(m). One of the conditions requires shareholder approval every five years of the material terms of the performance goals of the plan under which the compensation will be paid. The Companys shareholders most recently approved
the material terms of the performance goals of the 1997 Plan at the Companys 2007 Annual Meeting. The Company has amended the list of business criteria on which performance goals may be based and is asking shareholders to approve the material
terms of the performance goals, as amended, under the 1997 Plan. No other terms of the 1997 Plan are being amended. </FONT></P><P style=""margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px""><FONT size=""1""> </FONT></P><P style=""margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"" align=""center""><FONT style=""font-family:Times New Roman"" size=""2"">11 </FONT></P><P style=""margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%""><FONT style=""font-family:Times New Roman"" size=""2"">For purposes of Section 162(m), the material terms of the performance goals include
(i) the employees eligible to receive compensation under the 1997 Plan, (ii) a description of the business criteria on which the performance goal is based and (iii) the maximum amount of compensation that can be paid to an employee
under the performance goal.

administrator from time to time selects. The plan administrator for the 1997 Plan is the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee. Awards may also be granted to consultants, agents, advisors and independent contractors who provide services
to the Company and its subsidiaries. The approximate number of persons who currently are eligible to participate under the 1997 Plan is 64,000. </FONT></P><P style=""margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px""><FONT style=""font-family:Times New Roman"" size=""2""><B>Performance Goals </B></FONT></P><P style=""margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%""><FONT style=""font-family:Times New Roman"" size=""2"">Under
the 1997 Plan as amended, for awards made in the form of or denominated in common stock, the business criteria on which performance goals can be based are: (i) profits or loss, revenue or profit growth or loss reduction, profit or loss related
return ratios, or other balance sheet or income statement targets or ratios; (ii) market share, including targets, ratios or other objective measures of sessions, units, orders, customers, sales, and other comparable metrics related to the
various businesses conducted by the Company; or (iii) cash flow, share price appreciation, dilution or total stockholder return, as the plan administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion. Such performance goals may be stated in absolute

Such
awards may include, but are not limited to, stock options and awards made or denominated in shares of common stock. Awards may be granted singly or in combination. Not more than 4,500,000 shares of common stock may be made subject to awards under
the 1997 Plan to any individual in the aggregate in any one fiscal year of the Company, except that the Company may make additional one-time grants of up to 18 million shares to newly hired or newly promoted individuals. The foregoing
share limitations will be proportionately adjusted by the plan administrator in the event that a stock dividend, stock split, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, distribution to shareholders other
than a normal cash dividend, or other change in the Companys corporate or capital structure results in the Companys outstanding shares (or any securities exchanged therefore or received in their place) being exchanged for a different
number or class of securities of the Company or of any other corporation or new, different or additional securities of the Company or of any other corporation being received by the holders of shares of the Companys common stock.

compensation arrangements that qualify as fully tax deductible performance-based compensation in the 1997 Plan. The Board is therefore asking shareholders to approve, for Section 162(m) purposes, the material terms of the performance goals set
forth above. However, shareholder approval of the 1997 Plan is only one of several requirements under Section 162(m) that must be satisfied for amounts realized under the 1997 Plan to qualify for the performance-based compensation
exemption under Section 162(m), and submission of the material terms of the 1997 Plans performance goals for shareholder approval should not be viewed as a guarantee that the Company can deduct all compensation under the 1997 Plan.
Nothing in this proposal precludes the Company or the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee from making any payment or granting awards that do not qualify for tax deductibility under Section 162(m)<B>, </B>nor is there any guarantee
that awards intended to qualify for tax deductibility under Section 162(m) will ultimately be viewed as so qualifying by the Internal Revenue Service. A summary of other significant terms of the 1997 Plan is set forth as Appendix A to this

These activities
include direct and indirect contributions to candidates; political parties or organizations; independent expenditures; or electioneering communications for federal, state, or local candidates. </FONT></P><P style=""margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%""><FONT style=""font-family:Times New Roman"" size=""2"">Disclosure is affirmed by the US Supreme Court, is in the best interest of Amazon shareholders, and is critical for compliance with
federal ethics legislation. Absent transparency and accountability, Amazon money can be used in ways that harm the long-term interests and objectives of Amazon and its shareholders. </FONT></P><P style=""margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%""><FONT style=""font-family:Times New Roman"" size=""2"">Despite assertions to the contrary, publicly available data is <U>not</U> readily accessible and does <U>not</U> provide a complete
picture of Amazons political expenditures. For example, Amazons payments to trade associations used for political activities are entirely undisclosed and unknown. </FONT></P><P style=""margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%""><FONT style=""font-family:Times New Roman"" size=""2"">As evidence of this, the <B>CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Accountability and Disclosure</B> ranks Amazon at the bottom of S&amp;P 100 companies for political disclosurewith a score of
zero out of 100 points. At many companies, management does not know how trade associations use corporate money politically. This proposal asks Amazon to disclose all of its political contributions, including payments to trade associations and other
tax exempt organizations. This would bring Amazon in line with more than half of the S&amp;P 100, who have disclosure polices like these and present this information to shareholders. </FONT></P><P style=""margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%""><FONT style=""font-family:Times New Roman"" size=""2"">Disclosure and transparency is needed for both Company and shareholders to fully evaluate the political use of corporate assets.
</FONT></P><P style=""margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%""><FONT style=""font-family:Times New Roman"" size=""2"">The bottom line is simple: Amazon either has this information and can readily share it with shareowners, or it should have it
(absent which, it is failing in its duty to protect shareholder value). </FONT></P><P style=""margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%""><FONT style=""font-family:Times New Roman"" size=""2"">Therefore, please vote <B>FOR</B> this common-sense

to be reported and disclosed on applicable state websites of the Secretary of State, ethics commission, public disclosure commission, or legislature, or similar websites. As disclosed in the Political Expenditures Statement, in 2011 most of our
spending on our state government relations efforts related to California, specifically contributions to More Jobs Not Taxes, a coalition of an affiliate of the Company and California consumers, formed to seek a ballot referendum on certain
provisions relating to sales tax collection in the annual California budget bill.</FONT></P><P style=""margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%""><FONT style=""font-family:Times New Roman"" size=""2"">We also belong to certain trade associations

report in our Political Expenditures Statement. </FONT></P><P style=""margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%""><FONT style=""font-family:Times New Roman"" size=""2"">Finally, as noted in the Political Expenditures Statement, we have formed a
political action committee (PAC), but the PAC is funded by voluntary contributions of our employees and shareholders, and their spouses  not corporate funds. The PACs activities are subject to federal regulation, including detailed
public disclosure requirements. The PAC files regular public reports with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), and political contributions to and by the PAC are required to be disclosed. These reports are publicly available on the FEC

Droughts and floods happen more often, as well as forest fires.</STRONG></SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">But in recent years, Brazil’s government, which holds the largest swathe of the biggest tropical forest in the world, has privileged economic interests over preservation, according to one of the world’s leading experts on the region and its environment.</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">Philip Fearnside, a US-born professor at Brazil’s National Institute for Research in Amazonia (INPA), has researched the Amazon for three decades. In an interview with <mark>Climate</mark> Home in his office in Manaus, he explains how <mark>climate change</mark> is driving forest fires through the most important forest on earth, creating a cycle of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions that threatens to push beyond human’s capacity to control it. </SPAN><SPAN class=""s1"">He also criticises Brazil’s government for their favouring of industry and explains the country’s peculiar relationship to its own laws.</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1""><B>CH: What do we know and what don’t we know about <mark>climate change</mark> in the Amazon? </B></SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">PF: The <mark>climate</mark> has changed. Major droughts and major floods are both more frequent. The water levels in the rivers have gone to extremes. Higher floods than ever before and also more lower water levels in the low water periods than ever before, so it’s something that is obviously different from what the patterns had been in the past century.</SPAN></P><DIV id=""attachment_34981"" style=""width: 210px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Philip Fearnside (Photo: INPA)</P></DIV><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">This is most likely the result of different phenomena that are linked to global warming, which, of course, is an anthropogenic phenomenon. You have two major things that cause droughts here. El Niño, which causes droughts in the northern part of the Amazon region, and you have Atlantic dipole, which causes droughts in the southern part.</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">This Atlantic dipole has been increasing in frequency at a tremendous rate, much faster than El Niño, which is also increasing. We had a major drought in southern Amazonia in 2005 and another one in 2010, just five years later.</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">It’s linked to warming of water on the surface of the tropical part of the Atlantic, north of the Equator. And that is explained by a decrease in the amount of dust over the Atlantic ocean. There’s a lot of dust that comes from the deserts in Africa and there have been particles coming from <mark>pollution</mark> in Europe, too, which is also decreasing.</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">But the rainfall in the world is increasing. As you have the oceans warming up all over the world, so there’s more water evaporating. And water has to fall somewhere as rain. Rainfall has increased over the Atlantic Ocean. So that is washing out this dust that is in the atmosphere, removing what was a shield that was keeping some of the energy from the sun from reaching the water in the ocean.</SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p1""><A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changenews.com/2017/07/17/brazils-temer-extends-amnesty-amazon-land-grabbers/"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>Report:</STRONG> Brazil’s Temer extends amnesty to Amazon land-grabbers</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">Removing a lot of that shield allowed the water to warm up more, so more air is going to rise. Warm water also has consequences for hurricanes, but for Amazon droughts the problem is that more air is rising when the sun is right above that patch of water. The place on the Earth where the sun is beating down directly migrates north and south of the equator, and for part of the year this location is in the tropical north Atlantic.</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">This air cools as it goes up, and it will dump a lot of rainfall right there, and the rising air then divides, with part going north and part going south. The air travels for 30 degrees latitude and then falls back to the surface of the Earth, after which it makes a circle and goes back to where it was before. </SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">If there’s more air going up, it means there also more coming down in the other side of cycle. The place where the air is coming down, is over the southern part of the Amazon, in places like Acre and Rondônia. The descending air is dry, creating a drought when it comes down.</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">Also, the warmer water in the tropical north Atlantic pushes the place where the air comes down even farther north. This means it’s even farther into the Amazon, where it’s drying things out. This is what gives you an Atlantic dipole drought. </SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">Those things together give a pattern: extreme drought in the southern part of the Amazon. Forest fires in Acre, which is not a place that is used to forest fires like the northern part of the Amazon is. This is a kind of drought that is expected to increase rapidly over the next few decades. </SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1""><B>What is the impact of El Niño?</B></SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">In the fourth report of the IPCC there is a clear statement that, with more global warming, there will be more “El Niño-like conditions”. This is the key phrase. It’s not El Niño itself, but rather means a big patch of warm water in the Pacific Ocean, which is what causes El Niño.</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">The problem is to get <mark>climate</mark> models to agree on the next step, which is how the warm water affects currents of air in the atmosphere and, therefore, droughts and floods in different parts of the world. The <mark>climate</mark> models don’t agree enough to be able to say all these are linked to global warming.</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">But one of the impacts of a patch of warm water in the Pacific that you can see that very clearly  is big droughts in the northern part of the Amazon. For that, there is no doubt – it’s very obvious.</SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p1""><A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changenews.com/2017/05/19/brazils-pro-beef-president-temer-betrayed-industry-courted/"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>Report: </STRONG>Brazil’s pro-beef president Temer, betrayed by the industry he courted</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">Every time there is a big patch of warm water in the Pacific Ocean, you have a big drought and forest fires in the Amazon. That happened in 1982, 1997, 2006, and 2015. El Niño produced <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/30/vast-amazon-wildfire-destroys-forest-in-brazil-and-threatens-uncontacted-tribe"" target=""_blank"">huge forest fires</A> in the Brazilian state of Roraima and in Venezuela.</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">These fires represent something that the forest simply can’t stand up to. The Amazon forest isn’t adapted to fire, it’s not like the savannahs in central Brazil, where the trees have thick bark and are adapted to fires. Amazon forest fires kill a lot of trees. The fire moves through the understory of the forest, burning leaves and twigs on the ground. It’s not what people imagine of a forest fire. People think of the Disney movie Bambi, with the whole forest burning up. That’s what you get in pine forest, not an Amazonian forest. But even that little line of fire will kill a lot of trees. It moves very slowly, so it takes times to pass each one of the trees.</SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p1""><A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changenews.com/2017/09/26/forest-diamonds/""><STRONG>Forest Diamonds:</STRONG> How the Catholic church helped open up a forest to miners</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">So, the next time you have an El Niño, there will be a lot of dead wood in the forest, and that’s firewood that’s going to burn. It’s a vicious cycle that gets started and after three or four fires, basically you don’t have a forest anymore, just a bare area with a few scattered trees here and there.</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">This is very dangerous for the <mark>climate</mark> because it’s something that doesn’t depend on people deciding what to do. You can decide not to burn fossil fuels and not to cut down trees with chainsaws. But if a forest is being killed because there are more forest fires, it’s something happening beyond human control. And there’s a limit to how much humans can do to control global warming. </SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1""><B>What are the policy changes that are taking place in the Brazilian Amazon?</B></SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">There are many problems with changes in public policies in the Amazon. There were also problems in the previous presidential administration, but they certainly became more grave in the year we have had this administration [under Michel Temer]. There is a series of bills and proposed constitutional amendments passing through the national Congress that would basically, eliminate environmental licensing, open indigenous lands to mining, and make it <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changenews.com/2017/07/17/brazils-temer-extends-amnesty-amazon-land-grabbers/"">easier for land claims</A> to be legalised. </SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p1""><A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changenews.com/newsletter-sign-up/""><STRONG><mark>Climate</mark> Weekly:</STRONG> Sign up for your essential <mark>climate</mark> news update</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">These things lead to more construction projects for highways, dams, mines and so forth without the environmental and social restrictions that have helped slow down the most damaging kinds of development.</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">The economy as a whole is moving towards extraction of physical products and exporting minerals, timber and soybeans, things like that, as opposed to manufactured goods and other things that have less environmental impact.</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1""><B>How easy it is to change policies in Brazil?</B></SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">The politics in Brazil are different to other countries in various ways. One important thing is that it is very easy to pass constitutional amendments. It’s very different from the US, for example, and other places. The constitution has been amended 95 times since it came into effect in 1988. This opens the way to have all sorts of fundamental things change.</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">There are other aspects of Brazil that are strange. There are many laws that are simply never enforced. Laws are tested to see whether they will actually be enforced or not. This happens over and over with regulations on deforestation, environmental licensing and whatever. People in other countries just assume that whatever is the law is what actually is going to happen. That isn’t the case here. </SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">Brazil has decreed that it requires indigenous people be consulted over projects that would directly affect them. It is part of <A href=""http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C169"" target=""_blank"">convention number 169</A> of the International Labour Organisation, which was converted into a Brazilian law in 2004. It’s simply not enforced. </SPAN></P><DIV style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Michel Temer (Photo: Diego DEAA)</P></DIV><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">You’ve got a dam that just got its final approval a couple of weeks ago: the São Manuel Dam, which didn’t have any sort of consultation with the indigenous peoples. It’s only 700 metres from an indigenous area.</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">There are other things that are different. One is putting things in “contingency” status. This simply does not exist in North America or Europe. Here you have a budget for the environment ministry, for example, at the beginning of the year, but that doesn’t mean they’re actually going to get that money. Sometime in the middle of the year, the money runs out and so the government puts different areas in contingency status, which means they don’t get the money they were promised until the government collects more taxes and has money to give out. </SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">In practice, there is much less money for enforcing environmental laws that you would imagine just looking at the federal budget. So, lots of things can happen between a public policy being set up and having the actions actually happen in practice. This is certainly evident in many different ways in the environment area.</SPAN></P><DIV class=""yarpp-related""><H3>Related posts:</H3></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

This threshold, also referred to as a tipping point, may occur when Amazonian forests die and are progressively replaced by fireprone brush and savanna (ecological tipping point), and rainfall is inhibited on a regional scale (climatic tipping point).
The <mark>climate</mark> and deforestation-driven substitution of forests to savanna-like and semiarid vegetation has been dubbed the Amazon forests’ “die back” (Cox et al. 2000, Cox et al. 2004; Nobre et al. 1991; Oyama and Nobre 2003). While there is still debate among scientists about this concept, some <mark>climate</mark>-simulation vegetation models predict that such a die-back could occur by the end of this century.
For some scientists (Nepstad, 2008), however, this timeframe may be optimistic as these models do not include land-use change or the synergistic effects of deforestation and regional <mark>climate change</mark>. If these factors were taken into account, we could face a dire scenario in which current trends in livestock, agriculture, logging expansion, fire and drought could destroy or severely damage 55% of the Amazon rainforest by the year 2030 (Nepstad 2008).</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""right-column""><DIV class=""container col4 image aside highlight boxed""><DIV class=""image-caption""><DIV class=""container""><DIV class=""caption hover"">Soil moisture levels across the Amazon during four periods of severe drought.

Water released by plants into the atmosphere through <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evapotranspiration"">evapotranspiration</A> (evaporation and plant transpiration) and to the ocean by the rivers, influences world <mark>climate</mark> and the circulation of <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_currents"">ocean currents</A>. This works as a feedback mechanism, as the process also sustains the regional <mark>climate</mark> on which it depends. <H3>What is happening in the Amazon?</H3>
But scientists are noticing something disturbing in the Amazon rainforest - the hydrological engine is beginning to fail. Two major factors are at play.
One factor is the <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.elnino.noaa.gov/"">El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</A>, a climatic phenomenon which influences much of the climatic variability in Latin America. Although ENSO events are a natural occurrence, human-induced <mark>climate change</mark> is expected to increase their frequency in the future.
ENSO is associated with dry conditions in northeast Brazil, the northern Amazon, the <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altiplano"" target=""_blank"">Peruvian-Bolivian Altiplano</A>, and Pacific coast of Central America. Meanwhile, southern Brazil and northwestern Peru have exhibited unusually wet conditions during ENSO events.
Another factor is deforestation, which in addition to removing forest cover causes a dramatic change in rainfall patterns and distribution. These findings imply that current deforestation in the Amazon has already altered the regional <mark>climate</mark>. They also support previous reports of increased shallow cloudiness over deforested areas.</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""right-column""><DIV class=""container col4 listing links boxed aside""><DIV class=""inner""><H3>Find out more</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></OBJTEMPLATE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

For example, it doesn’t publish a comprehensive annual sustainability report, unlike many peers. A proposal by shareholders to issue such a document garnered <A href=""http://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/jeff-bezos-marks-amazons-banner-year-at-shareholders-meeting/"" class=""content-link"">only 25 percent of the vote</A> at last May’s annual shareholder meeting.</P><P>Amazon’s board said that, given it’s already committed to developing <mark>sustainable</mark> practices, working on an annual report “would not be an effective and prudent use” of time and resources.</P><P>Greenpeace in 2015 gave it an “F” for transparency for not providing enough detail about energy-saving measures in its cloud-computing business.</P><P>Aseem Prakash, director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington, says Amazon doesn’t disclose its figures to the CDP simply because it hasn’t felt it had to.</P><P>The company topped the 2016 list of “most reputable companies” among the U.S. public, gathered by the Reputation Institute, an advisory firm.</P><P>Amazon has flown under the radar of most environmental groups focused on other companies or in other industries and has little damage to reputation to mitigate on that front.</P><P>“Environmentalists have not paid sufficient political attention to Amazon,” Prakash said.</P><P>Moreover, despite the CDP’s claims that big investors want to see environmental data, the reality is most investors don’t necessarily care, Prakash said. Amazon’s stock price has more than doubled in two years.</P><P>The CDP says it represents 827 investors with $100 trillion in assets. Members include investment-management funds such as BlackRock and pension funds such as the California Public Employees’ Retirement System.</P><P>“It’s important to remember in the early days of corporate accounting, corporations were not expected to disclose what was on their books,” Pierce said.</P><P>“Now, of course, that’s not an option, really, in order for investors to understand whether you’re a good investment or not. There’s a substantial subset of investors around the world who believe that’s the case on <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>Pierce says publicly accounting for their <mark>carbon</mark> emissions has benefits for companies that go well beyond appeasing some investors or policymakers.</P><P>He said Wal-Mart, when establishing a process of CDP disclosure, found new ways of seeing and managing their operations more efficiently.</P><P>“They learn things about their companies,” he said.</P></DIV><DIV class=""extended-byline""><DIV class=""single-byline"">Ángel González: 206-464-2250 or <A href=""mailto:agonzalez@seattletimes.com"" class=""webonlylink"">agonzalez@seattletimes.com</A>.

They tested for three scenarios: a 2°C rise in global temperatures, the upper threshold of the <A href=""http://time.com/4801344/paris-agreement-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-donald-trump/"">Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement</A>, a 3.2°C increase that the U.N. warns is now the <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/31/un-warns-of-unacceptable-greenhouse-gas-emissions-gap"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">estimated forecast</A> for the end of the century, and a 4.5°C increase, if <mark>carbon</mark> emissions remain unchanged from current rates.</P><P>The study found that if global temperatures rose by 3.2°C, 60% of plant life and 50% of wildlife in the Amazon would be at risk. But that risk <A href=""https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/<mark>climate</mark>-change-could-imperil-half-of-plant-and-animal-species-in-the-world-s-most-naturally-rich-areas"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">increases dramatically </A>at if temperatures rise by 4.5°C, and would be catastrophic for the flora and fauna in particularly vulnerable areas such as the Miombo Woodlands in southern Africa, where the study projects the loss of 90% of amphibians and 80% or more of mammal, plant, and bird life.</P><P>The study’s authors propose two methods of reducing this ecological toll. One is dispersal, or allowing species to migrate to new, less vulnerable territory, which could decrease extinction by 20-25% if global temperature increases are kept to 2°C. The other, and more effective method, according to <A href=""https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/publications/1149/files/original/WWF_-_Wildlife_in_a_Warming_World_-_2018_FINAL.pdf?1520886759"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">the study</A>, is mitigation, or curtailing greenhouse gas emissions more ambitiously to minimize temperature increase.</P><P>“Mitigation really matters,” the study’s authors write, advocating for temperatures increases to be kept to 1.5°C if possible. But even “a best-case mitigation scenario” would see many parts of the world rendered uninhabitable to numerous species, the report found. “The most important thing the world can do is to keep global temperature rises to a minimum by doing everything possible to reduce the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""bottom-recirc padded-mobile "" data-tracking-zone=""bottom-recirc""><DIV class=""component lead-gen clearfix bottom-recirc"" data-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3365&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABPFT&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-mobile-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3365&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABPFT&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-partial=""sponsored-tile"" data-variation=""bottom-recirc"" data-title=""SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT"" data-provider=""dianomi"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-bottom-recirc"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-right-rail"" data-logo=""http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png"" data-logo_url=""https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&amp;utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank"" data-native_ad=""%7B%22dimensions%22%3A%22482x100%22%2C%22placement%22%3A%22footer%22%2C%22priority%22%3A6%7D"" data-nativekey=""KRVQvVbckcRMP4FTYBYnvWqY""><DIV class=""title-wrapper""><H3 class=""subtitle"">SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

A spokesperson did not immediately comment for the story, but a website for it appears to suggest that <A href=""http://www.wearestillin.com/"">more information is coming later today</A>. </P><P id=""gJvF0b"">For now, though, their opening salvo is a public commitment: Tech giants, along with other business and political leaders, said they are “joining forces for the first time to declare that we will continue to support <mark>climate</mark> action to meet the Paris Agreement.”</P><P id=""neuqHD"">“The Trump administration’s announcement undermines a key pillar in the fight against <mark>climate change</mark> and damages the world’s ability to avoid the most dangerous and costly effects of <mark>climate change</mark>,” according to a copy of the missive shared by sources with <STRONG>Recode</STRONG>. “Importantly, it is also out of step with what is happening in the United States.”</P><P id=""T3Y9pi"">“In the U.S., it is local and state governments, along with businesses, that are primarily responsible for the dramatic decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in recent years,” the note continues. “Actions by each group will multiply and accelerate in the years ahead, no matter what policies Washington may adopt.”</P><P id=""PMnUcE"">Announcing his intent to leave the Paris agreement during a speech in the White House’s Rose Garden last week, Trump said it “disadvantages the United States, to the exclusive benefit of other countries,” while arguing that it left “American workers, who I love, and taxpayers to absorb the costs.”</P><P id=""qyu91B"">Hours after Trump revealed his thinking, however, many state leaders, city mayors and U.S. businesses declared their opposition — while tech giants in Silicon Valley, which often have fought Trump, <A href=""https://www.recode.net/2017/6/1/15726132/donald-trump-withdraw-united-states-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-agreement-silicon-valley"">once again declared war on the White House. </A></P><P id=""eOJPja"">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <A href=""https://www.recode.net/2017/6/1/15727122/mark-zuckerberg-trump-paris-agreement-statement"">described the decision to withdraw</A> as “bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk.” Top executives at Google and Twitter tweeted similarly, and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who has advised Trump on business issues, even said he would <A href=""https://www.recode.net/2017/6/1/15726628/elon-musk-trump-paris-agreement"">cease participating on the president’s economic councils</A>. In a note to employees, obtained last week by <STRONG>Recode</STRONG>, Apple CEO Tim Cook also expressed his “disappointment” with Trump’s move. The iPhone giant’s chief even called the president — days before Trump announced his plans — to try to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement.</P><P id=""Xmaz0R"">Some of those companies previously joined with other business leaders to run full-page advertisements in major newspapers that pleaded with Trump to remain part of the Paris pact. The deal would have expanded “markets for innovative clean technologies,” they said, which could spur economic growth and job creation. And companies expressed fear that withdrawing would “expose us to retaliatory measures” from other countries’ governments.</P><P id=""v2bIoi"">Read the new, full letter, as obtained by <STRONG>Recode</STRONG>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P id=""Hq9kSA"">We, the undersigned mayors, governors, college and university leaders, investors and businesses, are joining forces for the first time to declare that we will continue to support <mark>climate</mark> action to meet the Paris Agreement.</P><P id=""3KYnhO"">In December 2015 in Paris, world leaders signed the first global commitment to fight <mark>climate change</mark>. The landmark agreement succeeded where past attempts failed because it allowed each country to set its own emission reduction targets and adopt its own strategies for reaching them. In addition, nations – inspired by the actions of local and regional governments, along with businesses – came to recognize that fighting <mark>climate change</mark> brings significant economic and public health benefits.</P><P id=""FjhlQ3"">The Trump administration’s announcement undermines a key pillar in the fight against <mark>climate change</mark> and damages the world’s ability to avoid the most dangerous and costly effects of <mark>climate change</mark>. Importantly, it is also out of step with what is happening in the United States.</P><P id=""6SiQ6s"">In the U.S., it is local and state governments, along with businesses, that are primarily responsible for the dramatic decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in recent years. Actions by each group will multiply and accelerate in the years ahead, no matter what policies Washington may adopt.</P><P id=""8BLJas"">In the absence of leadership from Washington, states, cities, colleges and universities and businesses representing a sizeable percentage of the U.S. economy will pursue ambitious <mark>climate</mark> goals, working together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions.</P><P id=""fTQVXf"">It is imperative that the world know that in the U.S., the actors that will provide the leadership necessary to meet our Paris commitment are found in city halls, state capitals, colleges and universities, investors and businesses. Together, we will remain actively engaged with the international community as part of the global effort to hold warming to well below 2°C and to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy that will benefit our security, prosperity, and health.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><ASIDE id=""i9sKM9""><DIV class=""c-newsletter_signup_box"" id=""newsletter-signup-short-form"" data-newsletter-slug=""recode_daily""><DIV class=""c-newsletter_signup_box__main""><SPAN class=""c-newsletter_signup_box__icon""><SVG id=""Layer_1"" data-name=""Layer 1"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" viewbox=""0 0 235.85 235.84""><TITLE>recode_logomark</TITLE></SVG></SPAN><H3 class=""c-newsletter_signup_box__title"">

They provide homes for people—three hundred million people worldwide live in forests, and 1.6 billion depend on them for their livelihoods. Forests also provide habitat for a vast array of plants and animals, many of which are still undiscovered.</P><P>But forests are being destroyed and degraded at alarming rates. Deforestation comes in many forms, including fires, clear-cutting for agriculture, ranching and development, un<mark>sustainable</mark> logging for timber, and degradation due to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Combining Avon’s global presence with WWF’s experience, we work together to protect the world’s forests, and as a result, our planet, biodiversity and peoples’ well-being.</P><H2>Why We Are Partnering</H2><P>Healthy forests are important to both WWF and Avon. WWF’s mission is to conserve nature and reduce the most pressing threats to the diversity of life on Earth. Forest conservation is a top priority in WWF's work.</P><P>Avon Products, Inc is the world's largest direct seller of beauty, fashion and home products, with more than $11 billion in annual revenue.

WWF’s Living Planet Report finds that biodiversity has declined 61% in tropical areas. The report estimates that more than one billion people living in poverty rely directly on forests for their livelihoods, while about 32 million acres have been lost globally each year between 2000 and 2010, a size equal to the state of Mississippi.</P><P>Responding to the alarming rate of deforestation driven by demand for timber, paper and agricultural products, Avon joined WWF’s <A href=""../../../initiatives/global-forest-trade-network"" target=""_self"">Global Forest &amp; Trade Network (GFTN)</A> in 2010, committing to purchase responsibly sourced paper. By participating in GFTN, Avon receives technical support from WWF to help meet its commitment that all papers used for the company’s product brochures and other marketing papers are sourced responsibly.</P><P>Specifically, Avon has committed to purchase 100 percent of its paper from independently certified or post-consumer, recycled-content sources by 2020, with a preference for Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified paper through the <A href=""http://www.avoncompany.com/corporatecitizenship/corporateresponsibility/sustainability/helpingenddeforestation/avon-paper-promise.html"">Avon Paper Promise</A>. As of 2011, 74 percent of Avon's brochure paper met the Avon Paper Promise commitments, and approximately 25 percent of paper used in Avon's product brochures is sourced from FSC certified forests.</P><H2>Helping Halt Deforestation</H2><P>Many of the world’s most threatened and endangered animals live in forests. Millions of people around the globe rely on forests for food, clothing, traditional medicine, shelter and subsistence agriculture. Yet the world’s forests are disappearing at a rate of 36 football fields per minute. This rapid forest loss is having devastating consequences for the environment as well as the wildlife and communities that depend on forests for their survival.</P><P>Avon’s Hello Green Tomorrow campaign is actively supporting WWF’s reforestation efforts in Indonesia. Home to orangutans, tigers and countless other species—as well as millions of people. In more than 50 countries the campaign is raising funds and building awareness to help end deforestation and restore critically endangered rainforests.</P><P>As a company committed to empowering women, Avon knows that forests also provide a direct source of income for hundreds of millions of entrepreneurial women. In addition to traditional forest-related employment opportunities, Hello Green Tomorrow has funded WWF projects that provide well-paying jobs for women.</P><P>To fund these important projects, Avon has turned to its customer base for support. In the U.S., 100 percent of the net proceeds from an exclusive Hello Green Tomorrow reusable water bottle, and other products go to WWF and other conservation organizations for the restoration of critically endangered forests. Through this partnership, Avon has donated almost two million dollars, providing critical funding for forest conservation.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""footer""><DIV class=""email-signup-login-footer shaded-dark gutter-vert-in""><DIV class=""row wrapper""><DIV class=""email-signup-footer span8""><P>Get the latest conservation news with WWF email.

    Outside contributors' opinions and analysis of the most important issues in politics, science, and culture.
  </P></ASIDE><DIV class=""c-entry-content""><P id=""DHdtn3"">Americans have always loved to compare themselves to the ancient Romans. Our political language and ideology are suffused with Latin influences like “capitol,” “forum,” and “senate”; the neoclassical style is our federal architecture; our very model of a constitutional republic is deeply indebted to Rome’s example.</P><P id=""54uvLY"">Naturally, the example of a great, seemingly indomitable power fading into ruin haunts the American imagination. The Roman Empire at its height stretched from the edges of Scotland to the sands of the Sahara, from the shores of the Atlantic to the hills of Syria. Economically, the Romans engineered one of the greatest “golden ages” of any preindustrial society. The empire was generous in granting Roman citizenship throughout its vast territory, and by making subjects into citizens, the empire helped to unleash the cultural potential of the provinces under Roman sway. </P><P id=""ulBoDe"">By the time of the first emperor Augustus (who ruled from 27 BC to AD 14), the Romans controlled virtually the entire Mediterranean shoreline, and they kept it for nearly half a millennium. </P><P id=""SvfAzT"">The empire reached its height in the middle of the second century. Although the great English chronicler of Rome’s fall, Edward Gibbon, described a long process of decline followed by piecemeal disintegration, today’s historians are skeptical of the idea of a slow decline. Rather, fiscal, social, and geopolitical challenges mounted and then suddenly overwhelmed the Romans. </P><P id=""Wm65lT"">The fall came in two parts: German kingdoms replaced Roman rule in the West in the fifth century, then Arab conquerors seized the prize parts of the Eastern empire in the middle of the seventh century. Of course, the underlying causes have always been hotly debated. Did the Romans tax too little or too much? Was there class conflict underneath the political regime? </P><P id=""or1aC2"">But in recent years historians have also started to revisit the fall of the Roman Empire with an openness to the importance of environmental factors, including <mark>climate change</mark> and pandemic disease. Thanks to amazing new evidence from the natural sciences, we can now see that, while the human factors remain integral, they are sometimes just the surface effects of the deeper and more powerful forces of nature. </P><P id=""6je1FJ"">The story of Rome, ultimately, reminds us of the fragility of human societies in the face of nature and our precarious dependence on the fickle planet that is our home. </P><P id=""qMbmhI"">Here are six ways that the environment — physical and biological — brought down the mighty empire. </P><H3 id=""kjzHry"">The Romans were enormously lucky when it came to <mark>climate</mark>. Then they got less lucky.</H3><P id=""hfVQyI"">Today, greenhouse gas emissions are altering the earth’s <mark>climate</mark> at an alarming pace, but <mark>climate change</mark> is nothing new. Slight variations in the tilt, spin, and orbit of the earth change the amount and distribution of solar energy reaching its surface; the sun itself emits variable amounts of radiation; volcanoes spew ash that hangs in the upper atmosphere and reflects heat back into space. Historians have only recently begun to take into account the gold rush of new data about the <mark>climate</mark> in the classical world.  </P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>Ecological zones of the Roman Empire	</FIGCAPTION><CITE>Kyle Harper</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""whUfb4"">It turns out the Romans were lucky. The centuries during which the empire was built and flourished are known even to <mark>climate</mark> scientists as the “Roman <mark>Climate</mark> Optimum.” From circa 200 BC to AD 150, it was warm, wet, and stable across much of the territory the Romans conquered. In an agricultural economy, these conditions were a major boost to GDP. The population swelled yet still there was enough food to feed everyone. </P><P id=""Sfi2R1"">But from the middle of the second century, the <mark>climate</mark> became less reliable. The all-important annual Nile flood became erratic. Droughts and severe cold spells became more common. The <mark>Climate</mark> Optimum became much less optimal.</P><P id=""aFVaIR"">The lesson to be drawn is not, of course, that we shouldn't worry about man-made <mark>climate change</mark> today, which threatens to be more severe than what the Romans experienced. To the contrary, it shows just how sensitive human societies can be to such change — now amplified in speed and scope by human activity.</P><H3 id=""HpCsM5"">Globalization brought great wealth — and disease</H3><P id=""cDJ4Eo"">In the AD 160s, at the apex of Roman dominance, the empire fell victim to one of history’s first recorded pandemics — an event known as the “Antonine Plague” (after the family name of the ruling dynasty). It was unprecedented in magnitude. Death tolls are hard to come by, but the outbreak took the life of something like 7 or 8 eight million victims. By comparison, the worst defeat in Roman military history claimed around 20,000 lives.</P><P id=""RQXqfN"">Its cause remains debated, but the likeliest candidate is the smallpox virus or an ancestor of smallpox (a virus that may have evolved not long before this outbreak, most likely in Africa). The Romans traded throughout the Indian Ocean world, across the Red and Persian Seas; their ships reached India and the East African coast. </P><P id=""pr5FbC"">This trading network carried spices and precious metals and slaves — and germs. Unleashed inside the densely settled and interconnected Roman Empire, the new pathogen was devastating. The Roman Empire survived the Antonine Plague, but the social order was unsettled. From that moment onward, maintaining Rome’s dominance along the frontiers became a greater challenge.</P><H3 id=""n8bTso"">A second pandemic pushes social institutions past the breaking point</H3><P id=""ITVgXC"">The empire rebounded from the Antonine Plague behind the vigorous rule of an African-Syrian dynasty known as the Severans. But in the AD 240s, a ferocious drought struck. Close on its heels, another pandemic, known as the Plague of Cyprian, broke out. The biological agent of this pestilence remains a mystery (though genomic evidence may yet turn up), but its impact is clear. It wasted the population from one end of the empire to the other.  </P><P id=""Kt6LJO"">The resulting demographic crisis triggered a total meltdown of the entire imperial system, known as the “crisis of the third century.” Enemies poured across every border, piercing deep into parts of the empire which had not seen war for centuries. One emperor after another seized the throne.</P><P id=""97wUyW"">The crisis is considered the “first fall” of the Roman Empire. The empire did reemerge, but with at least two profound changes. First, the empire was henceforth ruled by a different kind of emperor: A cadre of military officers from the provinces along the Danube seized control from the old, wealthy, Mediterranean aristocracy. </P><P id=""j8jHrc"">Second, the plague led to a crackdown on Christians that backfired mightily. At first, the Roman authorities blamed the pestilence on the Christian religious minority, and they set about trying to extirpate it. The church not only withstood the violent attacks but campaigned to care for the sick and bury the dead amid the pestilence — earning respect. Christianity grew more rapidly than ever in the aftermath of this trial. </P><H3 id=""Mupfuv""><mark>Climate change</mark> prodded the Huns to move, setting up a chain reaction</H3><P id=""KEtTpS"">The Roman Empire in the fourth century, led now by Christian emperors, enjoyed a kind of second golden age. But it was not destined to last. In the last decades of the fourth century and the first decades of the fifth century, the empire suffered a series of military defeats unlike anything in its history — at the hands of the Goths. But the Goths, in turn, were prodded to move against the Romans because of an incursion into Europe of Huns, from central Asia.</P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>Evidence from tree rings has helped historians study the paleo<mark>climate</mark>.</FIGCAPTION><CITE><A href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tree_rings_-_geograph.org.uk_-_738518.jpg"">Wikimedia Commons</A></CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""PiV8eS"">New paleo<mark>climate</mark> evidence helps to explain why the Huns suddenly moved West. The Huns were nomads, native to the great belt of steppe that stretches from Hungary to Mongolia, an arid zone that depends on westerly mid-latitude storm tracks for rain. </P><P id=""S2uF37"">Tree rings suggest that a megadrought in the middle of the fourth century might have made these nomads desperate for greener pastures. As they migrated West, they terrified the highly developed kingdoms, such as those of the Goths, that had long existed along Rome’s frontier. Partly because of this <mark>climate</mark>-caused upheaval, the Goths challenged Rome’s frontiers as never before. Rome’s Western territories ended up being carved up and reconfigured as Germanic kingdoms. </P><H3 id=""SdsvcC"">The Late Antique Little Ice Age</H3><P id=""TNnSRK"">We rightly fear <mark>climate change</mark> in the form of global warming, but in the later Roman Empire, the greater danger was sudden sharp cooling. While the Western half of the empire fell, the Eastern, Greek half of the empire, now centered on New Rome, a.k.a. Constantinople, thrived. </P><P id=""XIei7X"">In fact, during the reign of Justinian (who ruled from 527 to 65), the Roman Empire found new glory. In the first part of his reign, Justinian codified all of Roman law, went on the grandest building spree in Christian history (including erecting the Hagia Sophia), and took back Roman Africa and Italy. </P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>A painting (circa 1774 to 1776) depicting Vesuvius erupting, by Thomas Wright. Volcanic eruptions in the 530s and 540s nearly blotted out the sun.</FIGCAPTION></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""61tpyR"">But then came perhaps the worst environmental catastrophe yet: the dual blow of a little ice age and yet another pandemic. In the 530s and 540s, volcanic eruptions rocked the globe. We have long known that in the year 536 there was no summer; for about 15 months, the sun seemed to shine only dimly, unnerving people worldwide. In recent years, careful work on tree rings and polar ice cores has clarified what happened. </P><P id=""mH5XgV"">First, in AD 536, there was a massive eruption in the Northern Hemisphere. Second, in AD 539/40, a tropical volcano erupted. The result was not just a year of darkness but truly staggering global cooling: The decade 536 to 545 was the coldest decade of the last 2000 years, with average summer temperatures in Europe falling by up to 2.5 degrees Celsius. And this was no passing phenomenon. For a century and a half, colder temperatures prevailed across large parts of the Northern Hemisphere. </P><H3 id=""B6mGAz"">The <EM>first</EM> black death</H3><P id=""BkDf7J"">Just as the <mark>climate</mark> started to turn colder, the plague appeared on the Southern shores of the Mediterranean — in AD 541. This was true bubonic plague, caused by the bacterium <EM>Yersinia pestis</EM>, the agent of the more famous medieval Black Death. </P><P id=""JcXgqe"">Thanks to remarkable analysis of its genome, the history of this bacterium is now well understood. The plague is at root a disease of rodents, and had been endemic among social burrowing rodents in central Asia. It probably traveled to Rome across the trading networks that carried silks from China to the Mediterranean. The plague first spread from one rodent species to another, carried by fleas — ultimately infecting black rats, which live in close quarters with humans. Once the bacterium reached the rats of the Roman Empire, it was mayhem. </P><P id=""Lq1V7S"">This precursor to the more famous European “Black Death” of the middle ages may have carried off half of the entire population of the Roman Empire. The immediate (and insuperable) problem was disposing of the corpses; the longer-range problem was managing an empire with a severely weakened tax base and a serious manpower shortage — including in the army. </P><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION>Yersina pestis, the bacterium that causes the plague.</FIGCAPTION><CITE>Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIAID, NIH</CITE></SPAN></FIGURE><P id=""DN7nSF"">What’s more, the first pandemic inspired a wave of apocalyptic fervor. The pandemic not only wrecked Justinian’s dream of restoring Roman glory; it triggered a spiral of dissolution and state failure that stretched over the next century. One insidious aspect of plague is that it does not vanish after its initial work. It became permanently established in rodent colonies inside the Roman Empire and broke out repeatedly, every 10 to 20 years, unleashing new destruction each time. This helped push the Romans past the breaking point. By the middle of the seventh century, very little remained of the “eternal empire.”</P><P id=""as7ZzV""><EM>Kyle Harper is professor of classics and letters, and senior vice president and provost at the University of Oklahoma.

In a series of articles over the coming months, we will explore the question of how digitalization can be done “on purpose” — that is, how we can ensure that digitalization will be a force for good, a force to transform economies so that they foster greater equity, environmental integrity, and shared global prosperity. </P><P>This article sets out to define the terms <EM>digitization, digitalization</EM>, and <EM>digital transformation</EM> so that they can serve as a framework for understanding how the digital revolution can also become a revolution for <mark>sustainable</mark> development. It represents a first step in helping leaders purposefully guide their organizations toward a better digital future.</P><H3>The Digitalization Blitzkrieg</H3><P>The progressive digitalization of industries is causing anxiety in C-suites around the world. Wave after wave of digitalization — publishing, music, film, banking — has disrupted multibillion-dollar industries. It is now upending retail, as companies like <mark>Amazon.com Inc.</mark> leave a trail of zombie shopping malls across the heartland. On the horizon is the disruption of sectors like energy, hotels, and transportation. Manufacturing is not far behind. </P><P>It’s no wonder that most leaders are struggling merely to come to grips with the implications of digitalization, let alone forming a clear strategy about how to deal with it. But if we can rise above the fog of digital war, a larger horizon can be seen. From our elevated view we can ask larger questions about what businesses and society want from digitalization. Questions like: “Can we pursue digitalization with a higher purpose in mind?” and “Can we steer digitalization to be a force for good, a force to transform economies so that they foster greater equity, environmental integrity, and shared global prosperity?”</P><P>Right now, two principal forces are driving digitalization. One is digital technology itself and its associated services and gadgets. Another is the invisible hand of the market responding to the evolving wants of consumers. </P><P>While these have historically been two powerful forces for progress, there are inherent limitations in their ability to steer society. First, laissez-faire markets have inequality built into them. This is because they respond preferentially to the wants of those with fat wallets. The needs of the world’s poor are poorly translated into market signals. Markets are also imperfect in that they fail to take into account externalities like environmental <mark>pollution</mark>, which degrades the planet. These limitations, if not attended to, almost guarantee that digitalization will not become the force for societal good that it has the potential to be.</P><H3>Purposeful Digital Transformation</H3><P>The world’s leaders — commercial, nonprofit, and governmental — need to pursue digitalization on purpose, purposefully leading the world toward a <A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/tag/digital-leadership/""> better digital future</A>. Doing so requires a bigger perspective and greater responsibility for decisions made around digital technologies. It requires proactively scanning the emerging landscape for both social and environmental risks while simultaneously looking for opportunities to use digital technologies to resolve global challenges. This is digital transformation on purpose.</P><P>Grounded decision-making depends on having a framework for understanding the consequences of choices, so it would be helpful to have a framework for understanding how digitalization proceeds. We offer one below that defines the terms <EM>digitization, digitalization</EM>, and <EM>digital transformation</EM>. There is no consensus on the meaning of these terms and their definition often depends on who is using them: <A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dont-confuse-digital-with-digitization/"">technologists</A>, <A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/digital-transformation-is-a-misnomer/"">consultants</A>, <A href=""https://www.i-scoop.eu/digitization-digitalization-digital-transformation-disruption/"">etc</A>. Our goal in defining the terms here is to create a framework that can help managers and policy makers think about using digital technology for the purpose of tackling the world’s sustainability problems. The definitions are presented in “A Framework for Understanding Digitalization.”</P><DIV class=""callout-highlight""><ASIDE class=""l-content-wrap""><ARTICLE><H4>A Framework for Understanding Digitalization</H4></ARTICLE></ASIDE></DIV><P>At a basic level is <EM>digitization</EM>, which is the initial conversion of products and services into a digital format, along with the concomitant inventions that result from digitization. This has happened first with sectors like publishing, music, and finance, mostly because their products were really just information to begin with — it’s just that the information had historically been captured in a physical analog format like vinyl records and accounting ledgers. </P><P>While digitization of this type of information is relatively easy, it has been slower with more tangible, physical products. New technologies, however, are changing this. Manufacturing will be upended by imaging technology that can scan 3-D objects and turn them into data files that can be freely shared over the internet. Improving sensor technology will allow for the capture of digital data about objects in real time, forcing continuous evolution of the <A href=""http://www.infosys.digital/do-more/tech-trends/trillion-sensor"">internet of things</A>. Combine these technologies with 3-D printers that can locally render the digital files into desired objects and you open the floodgates for the disruption of nearly every manufacturing sector. </P><P>The next phase is the <EM>digitalization</EM> of industries in which innovators and entrepreneurs develop new business models and business processes that can take advantage of the newly digitized products. It was the process of digitalization that allowed Steve Jobs to become the world’s largest music retailer. Apple didn’t invent the digitization of the music industry, but it did invent the digital business model that upended it. </P><P>Digitalization is usually disruptive for incumbents because it renders their existing business models and processes obsolete. The proud legacy assets of market giants quickly go from a source of competitive advantage to the proverbial albatross around the neck. This is why executives’ hair is graying as digitalization progresses across industries.</P><DIV class=""email-signup-form""><FORM><H1><P>Research Updates from </P></H1><P class=""email-signup-text"">Get semi-monthly updates on how global companies are managing in a changing world.</P><BUTTON type=""button"" name=""submit"">Sign up</BUTTON><P class=""email-signup-error"">Please enter a valid email address</P><P class=""email-signup-success"">Thank you for signing up</P><P class=""email-signup-link""><A href=""/privacy-policy/"">Privacy Policy</A></P></FORM></DIV><P>Digitalization will not be limited to the commercial sector, however. It is also coming to the public sector and will alter the role of governments and how they engage with their constituencies. Digital technologies do not, in general, recognize political boundaries but instead connect citizens of many countries into a single network. The question of who is a constituent in this environment will change. For example, citizens in many countries are affected by the election of a U.S. president, but only Americans (in theory, if not always in practice) have a say in the choice.  Similarly, Amazon’s decisions about where to <A href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/09/29/what-would-boston-look-like-amazon-job-came-here/eIlKY4quXqaZ0XcbqOeMbJ/story.html"">locate facilities</A> can have a huge impact on a locality’s economic development, but only senior executives have a say in deciding. </P><P>Questions of global inclusion, equity, prosperity, and environmental integrity will likely shift us <A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-accords-rely-on-the-power-of-markets"">away from traditional thinking about “government” to a broader understanding of “governance” </A>that will blur the roles of local communities, governments, and corporations.</P><P>The final phase in this framework is <EM>digital transformation</EM>, which occurs when new digital business models and processes restructure economies. Societies also evolve as people integrate the technologies into their lives and habits. <A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/achieving-digital-maturity/"">Digital transformation </A> is a systems-level transition that alters behaviors on a large scale. </P><P>Consider mating behavior. The telephone and the automobile, for example, revolutionized dating, taking young couples out from under the watchful eye of their parents at the church picnic to far more private parking lots and “cruising” spots across suburbia. Smartphone apps have more recently upended dating, replacing flowers and chocolates with Tinder swiping and hookups, even <A href=""https://realbotix.systems/"">obviating the need for another human</A> for sex. Digital technologies are poised to continue transforming everything from <A href=""https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/04/google-pixel-buds-translation-change-the-world/"">communication</A> to <A href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/human-capital/us-cons-digital-workplace-and-culture.pdf"">work</A> — even the <A href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609203/crispr-20-is-here-and-its-way-more-precise"">human genome</A>.</P><P>Of course, technology-facilitated transformations restructure society in both positive and negative ways. And humanity has usually adapted in a reactive — not proactive — way to these changes. This is often because technologies can proliferate much faster than our ability to understand their impacts. The automobile had been ubiquitous for decades before we understood the downsides of “car culture,” like smog, sprawl, and <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>Undoubtedly, there are unforeseen and unintended consequences looming from digital transformation. The stakes for getting this right, or wrong, are huge. <A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/video-the-impact-of-machine-learning-on-work-is-bigger-than-you-think/"">Technological unemployment</A> risks deepening inequality, but also offers new opportunities for leisure and artistic expression. Bioengineering advances offer hope for a healthier future, but also risks eugenics. Broad-based digital infrastructure connects the world, but also introduces new systemic <A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/safeguard-your-organizations-iot-initiatives/"">threats and vulnerabilities</A>. Digitalization on purpose demands that we not let the transformation of society be driven solely through the animal spirits of imperfect market forces, but also through the visible hand of society’s better angels.</P><H3>Being Purposeful About Transformation</H3><P>Each step in the above process offers opportunities to ask how digital technology can be used to tackle the world’s sustainability challenges. In fact, there are examples of this already happening. </P><P>Silicon Valley’s Tesla Inc., for example, was explicitly founded to “accelerate the advent of <mark>sustainable</mark> transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.” An integral part of <A href=""https://www.tesla.com/blog/mission-tesla"">this mission</A> is the use of digital technology to transform transportation by connecting Tesla automobiles into shared fleets of self-driving vehicles operating on a distributed, renewable energy grid. <A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/mastercard-pins-down-the-cash-economy/"">Mastercard Inc.</A> is similarly using its digital network to help governments like South Africa tackle corruption and foster financial inclusion by converting social benefit programs from cash to safer digital payments. <A href=""https://www.cleanweb.co/about/"">The Cleanweb Initiative </A> is an organization of businesses, developers, and investors working to ensure information technologies become “a tool to improve global sustainability, economic prosperity, and human well-being.” </P><P>Opportunities like these will abound as the digital future unfolds. Our subsequent articles will follow the ensuing social transformation to provide real-time insight into how leaders can ensure their inevitable decisions serve our common digital future.</P><ASIDE class=""article-ad ad-300 ad-loop ad-300x250""><H6>advertisement</H6></ASIDE><DIV id=""article-authors"" class=""l-ref-block article-authors--inside ""><ASIDE><H5>About the Authors</H5><P>Gregory Unruh is the Arison Group Endowed Professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, and the <CITE>MIT Sloan Management Review</CITE>’s guest editor for the Sustainability Big Ideas Initiative.

Those figures rose to 67 percent for <mark>Amazon.com Inc.</mark>, 68 percent for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., 69 percent for Facebook Inc. and 70 percent for Microsoft Corp. These five companies are among the top corporate purchasers of renewable energy in the United States.</P><P>At the same time, 58 percent of adults under the age of 30 said they had heard either “a lot” or “some” about Google’s renewable energy-related practices. Forty-eight percent in that age bracket said the same about Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft, and 49 percent for Wal-Mart. Among all age groups, awareness of such practices ranged from 31 percent to 37 percent for the five companies.</P><P>The nationwide survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""column is-7 is-offset-1""><DIV class=""single-post__content""><DIV class=""single-post__content__plain""><P>After President Donald Trump announced on June 1 his intention to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord, all of the aforementioned companies signed the “We Are Still In” pledge to pursue the targets established by the international agreement.

Google and Facebook declined a request for comment.</P><P>Jenkins said that one way that Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Wal-Mart could better market their <mark>sustainable</mark> policies is through product packaging. He pointed to the packaging for Procter &amp; Gamble’s Tide purclean detergent, which states that the formula is made with 100 percent renewable electricity.</P><P>“I think as more brands begin to emphasize their investments on package and product marketing, you’ll see those recognition numbers pick up,” Jenkins said. “And I think those brands will continue to be rewarded as a result.”</P><P>Bowman was skeptical that consumers will pay close attention to sustainability messages from individual companies, especially when it’s about positive change instead of environmental foibles or scandals.</P><P>“It’s hard to expect people to pay that close attention to advertising or mission statements,” she said.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

CEOs at Ford, Goldman Sachs, Nike, and Starbucks spoke out against them.</P><P>When Indiana and North Carolina curbed anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, leaders of big companies strongly objected. PayPal <A href=""http://hrc-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com//files/assets/resources/NC_CEO_Letter_%283%29.pdf"">canceled plans</A> to expand in North Carolina, and the NBA moved its all-star game out of Charlotte.</P><P>But as President Trump prepares to back away from the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement, roll back the Obama administration’s signature <mark>climate change</mark> initiatives, and appoint an Environmental Protection Agency administrator who has repeatedly fought the agency, the leaders of corporate America have for the most part been muted or silent.</P><P>This poses a problem for environmentalists and their allies in Congress, particularly on the <mark>climate</mark> issue. </P><P>U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and a persistent advocate for <mark>climate change</mark> action, puts it this way: “One of the dirty secrets that we have to live with is that even the good-guy corporations don’t show up in Congress to lobby for doing something about <mark>climate change</mark>. Collectively, they do zero or less than zero to support <mark>climate</mark> legislation… That leaves the field to the bad guys.” </P><P>Without support from business, the environmental movement will struggle to defend itself against what David Goldston, director of government affairs for the Natural Resources Defense Council, calls an “incredible onslaught from both Congress and the administration.” What’s more, if environmentalists are to have any chance of convincing the federal government to enact stronger laws or regulations to curb <mark>climate change</mark> — a long shot, admittedly, for now — they will need big companies to use their political clout to turn around the Republicans who control Congress and the White House.</P><P>The reluctance of Fortune 500 companies to speak up on behalf of environmental protection is striking because it comes after decades of efforts by environmental nonprofits, ranging from The Nature Conservancy to Greenpeace, to develop partnerships with business. This work has paid off: Many companies have pledged to reduce their own <mark>carbon</mark> footprints, curb waste, and buy renewable energy. But few are willing to spend political capital on behalf of the environment.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">Why aren’t companies “speaking out more against the Trump administration’s ‘alternative facts’ on <mark>climate</mark>?”</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>The nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA is a case in point. “He’s not just bad on one thing,” says Fred Krupp, president of the business-friendly Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). “He’s bad on everything.” It’s the first time that EDF has campaigned against an EPA nominee, but the group has few business allies in the battle.</P><P>Tom Murray, an EDF vice president who works closely with business, says he hopes that “pragmatic business voices” will eventually step up to influence the Trump administration. “At this point, however, companies are hanging back on engaging in policy and politics,” he says. “Companies are trying to make sense of the new political landscape, concerned about becoming the president’s next social media target, and enticed by the potential of regulatory and tax reform.”</P><P>A business affiliate of the Natural Resources Defense Council called E2 (it stands for “environmental entrepreneurs”) did put together a letter from “<A href=""https://members.e2.org/jsp/controller?docName=petition(AlertPruittNomEPA)"">500 business leaders</A>” who oppose Pruitt, but the signatories include a registered nurse, a physical therapist, and not a single big-company CEO. </P><P>Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director, says big business needs to step up. “It simply makes no sense that big companies like Coke, Microsoft, Google, and other companies that care about and are doing great things with clean energy and sustainability aren’t speaking out more against the Trump administration’s ‘alternative facts’ on <mark>climate change</mark> and a national energy plan that will only increase our dependence on fossil fuels,” he says.</P><P>Worse, at least for environmentalists, some companies are actively turning against their erstwhile allies. Two days after Trump was elected, the Alliance of American Automobile Manufacturers, which represents Ford and General Motors, among others, urged the president’s transition team to roll back stringent fuel economy rules that were agreed to by the carmakers early in the Obama years. Environmentalists were stunned.</P><P>Says Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a nonprofit alliance of environmentalists and investors: “General Motors is doing a lot of good things on waste, they’re committed to 100 percent renewables, they’re supportive of the Paris talks. But on fuel economy standards, they like this new administration.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">In 2016, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google all donated more money to Republicans than Democrats.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>Meantime, as the political winds have shifted rightwards, so have campaign contributions from corporate political action committees (PACs). In 2016, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google — all of which had previously favored Democratic congressional candidates over Republicans — donated more money to Republicans than Democrats. Congressional Republicans have united to oppose plans to regulate the greenhouse gases that cause <mark>climate change</mark> since 2008.</P><P>All of this means that, when it comes to <mark>climate change</mark>, the loudest business voices in Washington belong to the fossil fuel industry and powerful trade associations, notably the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, that have staunchly opposed <mark>climate</mark> regulation. The chamber’s board includes executives from Accenture, Allstate Insurance, AT&amp;T, Caterpillar, Dow Chemical, FedEx, Florida Power &amp; Light, and Pfizer, all of which have pledged to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions. Public pension funds and so-called socially responsible investors have <A href=""http://www.ott.ct.gov/PolicyAndEducation/LettertoCompaniesAddressing<mark>Climate</mark>Change.pdf"">called on chamber members</A> to “address any misalignment between their own positions and actions on <mark>climate change</mark> and their funding of the chamber’s actions,” to little apparent effect.</P><P>To be sure, some big companies have backed up their <mark>climate change</mark> rhetoric with action in Washington. In 2009, Apple left the U.S. chamber over its <mark>climate change</mark> position and Nike resigned from the chamber board, citing the <mark>climate</mark> issue. Last year, Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft filed a legal brief in federal court supporting the EPA’s Clean Power Plan. General Mills, Mars, and Starbucks have lobbied side-by-side with Ceres on <mark>climate</mark> issues. </P><P>Since the election, Ceres, World Wildlife Fund, and a group called We Mean Business recruited a large number of small companies and a small number of large ones — Campbell Soup, DuPont, Gap, General Mills, HP, Intel, Kellogg, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mars, Mondelez, Monsanto, Staples, Starbucks, and Unilever, among them — to <A href=""http://www.low<mark>carbon</mark>usa.org/"">sign a letter</A> asking the new administration to affirm its commitment to the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement. Yet without further action at the state or federal level, the U.S. will probably fall short of meeting the <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> target that it agreed to in Paris, <A href=""https://phys.org/news/2016-09-track-<mark>carbon</mark>-<mark>pollution</mark>-goal.html"">experts say</A>.</P><P>Companies contacted by <EM>Yale Environment 360</EM> declined to discuss their Washington lobbying, campaign contributions, or trade association memberships. In a statement, Google explained its donations to Republican <mark>climate</mark> skeptics by saying: “Google engages on a wide variety of public policy issues and we work with policymakers and advocacy groups across the political spectrum. We’re never going to agree 100% with every organization or policymaker on every issue.” </P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">Corporations do not want to become a target of a president who is willing to call out individual companies by name.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>Gary Garfield, who recently retired as CEO of Bridgestone Tire, is one chief executive who did step up, wrangling senior executives in the tire industry to call for strong <mark>climate</mark> action. But he says environmental issues aren’t a priority for many CEOs because, unlike immigration or gay rights, they do not directly affect company employees. CEOs don’t want to unnecessarily aggravate political allies, shareholders, or employees over an issue that “doesn’t really directly affect their business,” he notes.
  </P><P>The Trump presidency complicates the calculus for businesses that need to manage an array of Washington issues, insiders say. “Companies absolutely care about <mark>climate change</mark>, but they care about other things too,” says Ceres’ Lubber. “They are balancing and juggling.” Corporations want Trump and the Republican Congress to support corporate tax cuts and infrastructure spending, and they do not want to become a target of a president who has been willing to call out individual companies by name. 
  </P><P>“Companies see a bully in the schoolyard, and they are off in the corner, doing their homework, and hoping the bully picks on someone else,” says Aron Cramer, the president and CEO of BSR, a network of businesses dedicated to sustainability. But, he says, business leaders understand the importance of <mark>climate policy</mark>, and they will speak up: “The underlying fundamentals will cause business to sustain their <mark>climate</mark> commitments and ultimately to be more vocal about those commitments.”

If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units.

In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the revenue recognition guidance to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are continuing to evaluate our method of adoption and the impact this ASU, and related amendments and interpretations, will have on our consolidated financial statements.</FONT></DIV><DIV style=""line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:29px;font-size:10pt;""><FONT style=""font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"">In July 2015, the FASB issued an ASU modifying the accounting for inventory. Under this ASU, the measurement principle for inventory will change from lower of cost or market value to lower of cost and net realizable value. The ASU defines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The ASU is applicable to inventory that is accounted for under the first-in, first-out method and is effective for reporting periods after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.</FONT></DIV><DIV style=""line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:29px;font-size:10pt;""><FONT style=""font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"">In November 2015, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for income taxes and requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current on the consolidated balance sheet.
