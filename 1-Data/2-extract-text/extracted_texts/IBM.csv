 Perhaps the coolest thing about <mark>IBM</mark>’s 9<SUP>th</SUP> “Five <mark>Innovation</mark>s that will Help Change our Lives within Five Years” predictions is that none of them sound like science fiction.
</P><P>
“With advances in artificial intelligence and nanotechnology, we aim to invent a new generation of scientific instruments that will make the complex invisible systems in our world today visible over the next five years,” said Dario Gil, vice president of science &amp; solutions at <mark>IBM</mark> Research in a statement.
</P><ASIDE id=""fsb-2114"" class=""fakesidebar fakesidebar-auto""><A href=""https://www.networkworld.com/article/3069956/security/5-ways-microsoft-has-improved-sharepoint-security.html#tk.nww-fsb"">RELATED: 5 ways Microsoft has improved SharePoint security</A></ASIDE><P>
Among the five areas <mark>IBM</mark> sees as being key in the next five years include artificial intelligence, hyperimaging and small sensors. Specifically, according to <mark>IBM</mark>:
</P><P>
1. In five years, what we say and write will be used as indicators of our mental health and physical wellbeing. Patterns in our speech and writing analyzed by new cognitive systems will provide tell-tale signs of early-stage mental and neurological diseases that can help doctors and patients better predict, monitor and track these diseases. At <mark>IBM</mark>, scientists are using transcripts and audio inputs from psychiatric interviews, coupled with machine learning techniques, to find patterns in speech to help clinicians accurately predict and monitor psychosis, schizophrenia, mania and depression.
</P><P>
Today, it only takes about 300 words to help clinicians predict the probability of psychosis in a user. Cognitive computers can analyze a patient’s speech or written words to look for tell-tale indicators found in language, including meaning, syntax and intonation. Combing the results of these measurements with those from wearables devices and imaging systems (MRIs and EEGs) can paint a more complete picture of the individual for health professionals to better identify, understand and treat the underlying disease.
</P><P>
2. In five years, new imaging devices using hyperimaging technology and AI will help us see broadly beyond the domain of visible light by combining multiple bands of the electromagnetic spectrum to reveal valuable insights or potential dangers that would otherwise be unknown or hidden from view. Most importantly, these devices will be portable, affordable and accessible, so superhero vision can be part of our everyday experiences.
</P><ASIDE id=""fsb-2602"" class=""fakesidebar fakesidebar-auto fakesidebar-sponsored""><STRONG>[ <A href=""https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/321564/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fadministering-office-365-quick-start"" rel=""nofollow"">Become a Microsoft Office 365 administrator in record time with this quick start course from PluralSight.</A> ] </STRONG></ASIDE><P>
A view of the invisible or vaguely visible physical phenomena all around us could help make road and traffic conditions clearer for drivers and self-driving cars. For example, using millimeter wave imaging, a camera and other sensors, hyperimaging technology could help a car see through fog or rain, detect hazardous and hard-to-see road conditions such as black ice, or tell us if there is some object up ahead and its distance and size. Embedded in our phones, these same technologies could take images of our food to show its nutritional value or whether it’s safe to eat. A hyperimage of a pharmaceutical drug or a bank check could tell us what’s fraudulent and what’s not.
</P><P>
3. In the next five years, new medical labs on a chip will serve as nanotechnology health detectives– tracing invisible clues in our bodily fluids and letting us know immediately if we have reason to see a doctor. The goal is to shrink down to a single silicon chip all of the processes necessary to analyze a disease that would normally be carried out in a full-scale biochemistry lab.
</P><P>
The lab-on-a-chip technology could ultimately be packaged in a convenient handheld device to let people quickly and regularly measure the presence of biomarkers found in small amounts of bodily fluids, sending this information streaming into the cloud from the convenience of their home. There it could be combined with data from other IoT-enabled devices, like sleep monitors and smart watches, and analyzed by AI systems for insights. When taken together, this data set will give us an in-depth view of our health and alert us to the first signs of trouble, helping to stop disease before it progresses.
</P><P>
4. In five years, new, affordable sensing technologies deployed near natural gas extraction wells, around storage facilities, and along distribution pipelines will enable the industry to pinpoint invisible leaks in real-time. Networks of IoT sensors wirelessly connected to the cloud will provide continuous monitoring of the vast natural gas infrastructure, allowing leaks to be found in a matter of minutes instead of weeks, reducing <mark>pollution</mark> and waste and the likelihood of catastrophic events. Scientists at <mark>IBM</mark> are working with natural gas producers such as Southwestern Energy to explore the development of an intelligent methane monitoring system and as part of the <A href=""https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/monitor"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">ARPA-E Methane Observation Networks with Innovative Technology to Obtain Reductions (MONITOR) program</A>.
</P><P>
5. In five years, we will use machine-learning algorithms and software to help us organize the information about the physical world to help bring the vast and complex data gathered by billions of devices within the range of our vision and understanding. We call this a &quot;macroscope&quot; – but unlike the microscope to see the very small, or the telescope that can see far away, it is a system of software and algorithms to bring all of Earth's complex data together to analyze it for meaning.
</P><P>
By aggregating, organizing and analyzing data on <mark>climate</mark>, soil conditions, water levels and their relationship to irrigation practices, for example, a new generation of farmers will have insights that help them determine the right crop choices, where to plant them and how to produce optimal yields while conserving precious water supplies. Beyond our own planet, macroscope technologies could handle, for example, the complicated indexing and correlation of various layers and volumes of data collected by telescopes to predict asteroid collisions with one another and learn more about their composition.

<mark>IBM</mark> has had some success with its “five in five” predictions in the past. For example, in 2012 it predicted computers will have a sense of smell. <mark>IBM</mark> says “sniffing” technology is already in use at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, working to preserve and protect priceless works of art by monitoring fluctuations in temperature, relative humidity, and other environmental conditions. “And this same technology is also being used in the agricultural industry to monitor soil conditions, allowing farmers to better schedule irrigation and fertilization schedules, saving water and improving crop yield,” <mark>IBM</mark> said.

In 2009 it had an expectation that buildings will sense and respond like living organisms. <mark>IBM</mark> said it is working with The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) to develop and install advanced <A href=""http://www.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/37788.wss"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">smart building technology</A> in 50 of the federal government’s highest energy-consuming buildings. “Part of GSA’s larger smart building strategy, this initiative connects building management systems to a central cloud-based platform, improving efficiency and saving up to $15 million in taxpayer dollars annually. <mark>IBM</mark> is also helping the second largest school district in the U.S. become one of the greenest and most <mark>sustainable</mark> by making energy conservation and cost savings as easy as sending a text message,” <mark>IBM</mark> stated.

Also to note is that today’s markets are not too pretty in terms of gains. Everything is in the red, including Stellar (XLM) that should be basking in the news that <mark>IBM</mark> will issue a token on its blockchain to help offset <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The current market analysis puts XLM at the value of $0.323 and down 12.24% in 24 hours. The rest of the market is also in the red. Bitcoin (BTC) is at the low $8,000 levels and currently trading at $8,248. Ethereum (ETH) is down below $700 and currently trading at $690. Ripple (XRP) is down 8% in 24 hours and currently trading at $0.68.</P><P>It is with this market background that Stellar might be moving to better days with the earlier mentioned announcement by <mark>IBM</mark> which has been known to being a Stellar partner for quite some time. The partnership was confirmed <A href=""https://www.stellar.org/blog/<mark>IBM</mark>-KlickEx-Partnership/"">back in October</A> when <mark>IBM</mark> and KlickEX chose Stellar to power the future of cross-border payments. <mark>IBM</mark> is currently running 9 stellar nodes for this purpose.</P><P><mark>IBM</mark> will then use the Stellar blockchain, in partnership with an environmental fintech startup called Veridium labs, to <A href=""https://www.ccn.com/<mark>ibm</mark>-to-issue-cryptocurrency-token-on-stellar-blockchain/"">tokenize <mark>carbon</mark> credits</A> in a bid to track the <mark>pollution</mark> emitted from big companies and to attempt at offsetting these damages to the environment. Proceeds from the token sale will be used to reforest a 250 square mile piece of rain-forest on the island of Borneo in Indonesia. The new token can be redeemed and traded on the Stellar blockchain simplifying the <mark>carbon</mark>-credit process. Companies and institutional investors can buy the same <mark>carbon</mark> credits using the tokens on the Stellar blockchain, allowing for easier tracking and redemption on the blockchain.</P><P>A <mark>carbon</mark> credit is defined as a  permit which allows a country or organization to produce a certain amount of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and which can be traded if the full allowance is not used. If a set amount of <mark>carbon</mark> is not emitted, the owner of the <mark>carbon</mark> credit can redeem it using the token.</P><P>With this news and the current ongoing Consensus Summit in New York, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies will assist in mitigating the progression and finally the end of global warming. The pioneer crypto for reducing global warming will be Stellar (XLM). This mission is in line with the vision of the Stellar foundation in that it brings together two companies, <A href=""https://globalcoinreport.com/why-<mark>ibm</mark>-is-getting-serious-about-investing-on-stellar-xlm/""><mark>IBM</mark></A> and Veridium, to help solve a real-life issue threatening our existence on this earth.</P><P><STRONG>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our <A href=""https://t.me/globalcoinreport"">Telegram</A>!</STRONG></P><P><EM>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Inspired by UN’s Ten Essentials for Making Cities Resilient, this tool enables cities to prioritize needs, track and measure the progress cities make, and identify major areas of weakness – before a natural disaster identifies these for them.

Consider the work of researchers in the field of <A href=""http://computational-sustainability.cis.cornell.edu/index.php"" target=""_blank"">Computational Sustainability</A><A href=""http://computational-sustainability.cis.cornell.edu/index.php)--"">--</A> a field of AI research making us better stewards of life on Earth. Despite being a relatively new research field, Computational Sustainability has already helped <A href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/06/paws-artificial-intelligence-fights-poaching-ranger-patrols-wildlife-conservation/"" target=""_blank"">fight wildlife poaching</A>, <A href=""https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S45/81/58E59/index.xml?section=topstories"" target=""_blank"">reduce greenhouse gas emissions</A>, <A href=""http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6301/790"" target=""_blank"">understand poverty</A>, <A href=""https://www.wired.com/2016/04/starfish-killer-robot/"" target=""_blank"">manage wildlife populations</A>, and <A href=""https://phys.org/news/2016-10-wildlife-migration-routes-multiple-species.html"" target=""_blank"">protect biodiversity</A>. Each of these contributions address one of the United Nations <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals (SDGs). The collected progress of AI is addressing all SDGs, but I will highlight three specific cases.</P><P><STRONG>SDG: <mark>Climate</mark> Action</STRONG></P><P>A core tenant of Computational Sustainability is balancing the environmental, economic, and societal needs for a <mark>sustainable</mark> future. Nowhere is the need for balance more apparent than in making energy production decisions. Renewable energy can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect us from <mark>climate change</mark>, but renewables like wind power cannot increase output whenever consumers increase their electricity demands. How can we rely on wind power if we cannot choose when the wind blows? Computational Sustainability researchers <A href=""http://www.newswise.com/articles/electrical-grid-could-use-offshore-wind-for-10-million-homes"" target=""_blank"">solve the problem</A> by predicting everything from wind speeds to squirrel interference in power distribution. With these improved predictions, it is possible to idle dirty power plants without risking shortfalls in power generation.</P><P><STRONG>SDG: Life on Land</STRONG></P><P>Protecting wildlife often requires governments to acquire land for wildlife protection, but budgets for land purchases are small compared to the <A href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/05/140529-conservation-science-animals-species-endangered-extinction/"" target=""_blank"">number of wildlife extinctions</A>. To make small budgets for wildlife conservation save more species, researchers from five institutions showed how to select lands for purchase that <A href=""https://phys.org/news/2016-09-optimization-technique-cost-effective-biodiversity-corridors.html"" target=""_blank"">simultaneously protect multiple threatened species</A>. Instead of protecting a few charismatic species, we are learning to protect entire ecosystems.</P><P><STRONG>SDG: Life Underwater</STRONG></P><P>Protecting multiple species requires knowing how those species inhabit an environment, but we know very little about the life and environment of our oceans. With the help of autonomous robots, we will soon be able to <A href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/mach/<mark>innovation</mark>/ocean-discovery-xprize-aims-reveal-deepest-secrets-sea-n744916"" target=""_blank"">survey the entire ocean floor</A> for a fraction of the current expected cost.</P><P>Despite these successes, the number of researchers solving global problems with AI is still relatively small. The benefits of Computational Sustainability are widespread, but the costs are concentrated. Without concerted government support to build on the work of Computational Sustainability, we will not see the many of the public goods made possible by AI.</P><P><EM>Sean serves as Technical Manager for the <mark>IBM</mark> Watson AI XPRIZE.

The task force began by asking women leaders about their perceptions regarding the barriers to advancement. A formal, six-month examination of these issues resulted in the creation of numerous subcommittees with an emphasis on global concerns. The various task forces—the Women of Color and Women in Technology subcommittees, the Global Women Leaders’ Steering Committee, and programs such as Mentoring and Employee Development—empowered, developed, and advanced diverse individuals throughout <mark>IBM</mark>. Specific global-focused components include a work/life survey in Latin America; a work/life survey in Europe, the largest work/life survey in the world; Global Women’s Leadership conferences; a global dependent care assessment; the institution of global women’s networks and women’s council; and a global partnership promoting flexibility in the workplace.</P><P>As a champion of <mark>IBM</mark>’s Task Force initiative, CEO and Chairman Lou Gerstner encourages a “top-down, bottom-up” approach to culture change. He communicates personal commitment to employees through letters, e-mails, and postings on the company’s intranet. Managers are required to attend diversity training courses, conduct departmental diversity meetings, and promote attendance at diversity town-hall gatherings. At the same time, constituency groups are encouraged to drive the culture change and diversity agenda by identifying their needs and opportunities for change. Accountability at <mark>IBM</mark> is strong: managers are accountable for meeting diversity results; Gerstner in turn reports results directly to <mark>IBM</mark>’s Board of Directors. Evaluations for both executives and managers include sections on commitment to diversity efforts.</P><P>Women’s representation at the executive level worldwide has increased steadily since the start of the initiative, <EM>Global Women Leaders' Task Force: Creating the <mark>Climate</mark> to Win</EM>. In North America, women comprised 14 percent of all executives in 1995; by 1999, that figure has risen to 21 percent. In the Asia-Pacific region, women executive representation grew from 1 percent in 1995 to 8 percent in 1999. In Latin America, there were no women executives in 1995; in 1999, women account for 5 percent of executives. And in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, women’s executive representation grew from 2 percent in 1995 to 8 percent in 1999. In fact, in total since year end 1995, the number of women in executive level positions has increased 175 percent and now totals over 500 women executives around the world.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

But if all goes well for Chad Rigetti, this summer he will join them, by making the machine on your desk as obsolete as an abacus.</P><P>“We’re on a mission to build the world’s most powerful computer,” says Rigetti, “to solve humanity’s most pressing problems.” Cancer, <A href=""https://www.ozy.com/acumen/the-science-of-<mark>climate</mark>-change-skepticism/76084"" target=""_blank""><mark>climate change</mark></A>, world hunger — all targets of the technology Rigetti has in mind. It’s a striking vision for a 38-year-old farm boy from Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, who once thought he would grow barley after high school.</P><P>To achieve his goal — creating the first commercial quantum computer — would amount to a revolution in computing. Conventional computers reduce logic problems to math problems, and math problems to a binary counting system: On or off equals one or zero. The time required to solve difficult problems has been getting shorter and shorter as computer engineers figure out how to make their on/off switches smaller, each year doubling the computing power contained within the same-size box. They now envision the day when they’re working on switches the size of atoms.</P><P>But that’s also the point at which they’ll hit a barrier, because subatomic particles behave according to the bizarre rules of quantum mechanics. A single particle can be in two places at once. It can instantly affect another particle light-years away. And it can travel through insulation, so it’s hard to find when you need it.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><SPAN class=""quote-text""><P>After more or less blundering into a physics class, Rigetti found himself lured by the mystery of quantum mechanics.</P></SPAN></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Such unpredictable behavior makes particles such as photons and electrons difficult to control — but it also gives them a kind of superpower. Instead of bits, a quantum computer uses qubits, which can be both on and off at the same time. A conventional processor does one calculation at a time. A quantum processor with one qubit can do two calculations at once. A two-qubit processor can do four, and so on. A 70-qubit processor would be more powerful than the most powerful supercomputer ever built, and a 100-qubit processor would be more powerful than a conventional computer the size of the universe.</P><P>Why does this matter? On a grand scale, quantum computers could make quantum mechanics more intuitive, perhaps triggering a shift in human understanding similar to the discovery that the Earth orbits the sun. More practically, they could solve complex problems involving the interactions of multiple variables, enabling them, say, to dramatically accelerate the pattern recognition essential to <A href=""https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/upgrading-ivf-with-the-help-of-artificial-intelligence/77069"" target=""_blank"">artificial intelligence</A>. They could also model how molecules interact to create new drugs — or they might develop a fertilizer that sucks greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.</P><DIV class=""inline_image inline_image_left image_size_med fullsize inline-element"" data-attachment=""109947"" data-sequence=""1"" id=""109947"" inline-image=""""><DIV class=""sharing-options""><DIV class=""close-button"" close-button-share=""""><SPAN class=""ozy-icon i-share-icon i-share-icon-dims""> </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""share-item"" url=""https://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/can-this-quantum-computing-genius-beat-out-<mark>ibm</mark>-and-google/79169#img109947"" picture=""https://pictures.ozy.com/pictures/1300xany/9/4/7/109947_chadrigettmeeting.jpg"" title=""Can This Quantum-Computing Genius Beat Out <mark>IBM</mark> and Google?"" description=""The Best Rising Stars of 2017: Chad Rigetti has plans to develop cures for cancer and to fight <mark>climate change</mark>.""><A class=""facebook-share"" facebook-picture-share="""" href=""javascript:void(0)"" data-evcat=""Story Page"" data-evact=""story_inline_med"" data-evlabel=""FB picture Share""><SPAN class=""ozy-icon i-share-hover-facebook-off i-share-hover-facebook-off-dims icon-off""> </SPAN><SPAN class=""ozy-icon i-share-hover-facebook-on i-share-hover-facebook-on-dims icon-on""> </SPAN></A><A class=""twitter-share"" twitter-picture-share="""" href=""javascript:void(0)"" data-evcat=""Story Page"" data-evact=""story_inline_med"" data-evlabel=""Twitter picture Share""><SPAN class=""ozy-icon i-share-hover-twitter-off i-share-hover-twitter-off-dims icon-off""> </SPAN><SPAN class=""ozy-icon i-share-hover-twitter-on i-share-hover-twitter-on-dims icon-on""> </SPAN></A><A class=""pinterest-share"" pinterest-picture-share="""" href=""javascript:void(0)"" data-evcat=""Story Page"" data-evact=""story_inline_med"" data-evlabel=""Pinterest picture Share""><SPAN class=""ozy-icon i-share-hover-pinterest-off i-share-hover-pinterest-off-dims icon-off""> </SPAN><SPAN class=""ozy-icon i-share-hover-pinterest-on i-share-hover-pinterest-on-dims icon-on""> </SPAN></A><A class=""email-share"" href=""mailto:?subject=Can This Quantum-Computing Genius Beat Out <mark>IBM</mark> and Google?&amp;body=The Best Rising Stars of 2017: Chad Rigetti has plans to develop cures for cancer and to fight <mark>climate change</mark>.%20https://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/can-this-quantum-computing-genius-beat-out-<mark>ibm</mark>-and-google/79169#img109947%0A%0ADon't forget to Sign up for OZY emails (http://www.ozy.com/emailsignup) or Like OZY on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Ozy)."" data-evcat=""Story Page"" data-evact=""story_inline_med"" data-evlabel=""Email Share""><SPAN class=""ozy-icon i-share-hover-email-off i-share-hover-email-off-dims icon-off""> </SPAN><SPAN class=""ozy-icon i-share-hover-email-on i-share-hover-email-on-dims icon-on""> </SPAN></A></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""meta no-icons""><DIV class=""caption""><DIV class=""sleeve""><P class=""inline_source""><CITE>Source <A href=""https://www.ozy.com"">Courtesy of Rigetti Computing</A></CITE></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>That last example comes readily to Rigetti, who operated a tractor as a teenager.

Once there, however, a torn ligament halted his athletic career — and curiosity took over.</P><P>After more or less blundering into a physics class, Rigetti found himself lured by the mystery of quantum mechanics — and he brought a wrestler’s tenacity to the thorniest equations. Eventually his efforts led him to Yale, where he teamed with Michel Devoret, an applied physicist with ideas for grappling with subatomic particles. Devoret proposed refrigerating silicon chips to colder than outer space, a temperature at which they become superconducting. Materials that are superconducting still behave in quantum ways, but their larger size makes it possible to manipulate them far more easily than individual photons and electrons.</P><P>Rigetti saw ways to build this idea into an actual quantum computer. From Yale, he took it to <mark>IBM</mark>, before founding his startup in 2013. Sitting for an interview in a conference room at Rigetti Computing in Berkeley, California, Rigetti sports the requisite <A href=""https://www.ozy.com/opinion/the-devils-guide-to-silicon-valley/76313"" target=""_blank"">Silicon Valley</A>–casual attire: down vest over a pin-striped shirt, and blue sneakers. The newly minted entrepreneur is also newly married, to Susan Fowler, the former Uber engineer whose blog post about sexual harassment at the company was a key factor in forcing its CEO, Travis Kalanick, to take a leave of absence. But while Rigetti may appear nonchalant, he’s anything but laid-back. He is obsessively punctual, runs a meticulously clean laboratory and tightly limits what’s disclosed about the company’s technology.</P><DIV class=""inline_image inline_image_left image_size_med fullsize inline-element"" data-attachment=""109948"" data-sequence=""2"" id=""109948"" inline-image=""""><DIV class=""sharing-options""><DIV class=""close-button"" close-button-share=""""><SPAN class=""ozy-icon i-share-icon i-share-icon-dims""> </SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""meta no-icons""><DIV class=""caption""><DIV class=""sleeve""><P class=""inline_source""><CITE>Source <A href=""https://www.ozy.com"">Courtesy of Rigetti Computing</A></CITE></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>“Secretive” is the word that Daniel Lidar, a quantum computing expert at the University of Southern California, chooses to describe Rigetti.

And the competition is formidable. <mark>IBM</mark>, Google, Microsoft and Chinese tech giant Alibaba are all racing to invent the first general purpose commercial quantum computer.</P><P>What makes Rigetti think he can slay these Goliaths? “It’s like GM versus Tesla,” Rigetti says. “You can do amazing things by building an organization from scratch.” That narrative has so far convinced venture capitalists to lay out $69.2 million, enabling the company to open offices in Berkeley and Fremont, California, and hire physicists from top universities and leading tech companies.</P><P>“I know people who work there,” says Seth Lloyd, professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, who devised part of the theoretical framework for quantum computing. “I don’t know if they’re going to win this race, but they are certainly real competitors in it.”</P><P>When Rigetti Computing launches its computer — the company promises an announcement this summer — experts such as Lloyd and Lidar have math problems ready to challenge it. If the quantum computer solves them faster than a conventional computer, a new era may be at hand for all of humanity. If not, the world still needs barley.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The supercomputer, a Power 575 Hydro-Cluster named &quot;Bluefire,&quot; was the first in a highly energy-efficient class of machines to be shipped anywhere in the world. Jobs first ran on Bluefire on May 30, 2008. It was placed into full production service on July 1, 2008, and decommissioned February 1, 2013.</P><P>Scientists at NCAR and across the country used Bluefire to accelerate research into <mark>climate change</mark>, including future patterns of precipitation and drought around the world, changes to agriculture and growing seasons, and the complex influence of global warming on hurricanes.</P><P>Bluefire's computing power helped scientists create the first-ever comprehensive computer model of sunspots. Researchers also used the system to improve weather forecasting models, enabling society to better anticipate where and when dangerous storms are most likely to strike. Each year Bluefire provided numerous opportunities for studying challenging problems, including projects related to snowfall and snowpack predictions, <mark>climate change</mark> simulations for use in water resource adaptation planning, ocean conditions, and unfolding natural disasters.</P><P>Researchers using Bluefire generated <mark>climate</mark> simulations needed for the fifth report on global warming by the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC), which conducts detailed assessments under the auspices of the United Nations. The IPCC was a recipient of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. Some of Bluefire's capacity was dedicated to the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System for operational weather forecasting in support of the NSF’s Office of Polar Programs.</P><P>As the primary production system for the <mark>Climate</mark> Simulation Laboratory (CSL) and the NCAR/UCAR user community, Bluefire proved to be a reliable and efficient computational platform.</P><P>Bluefire had a peak speed of more than 77 teraflops (77 trillion floating-point operations per second), replacing three supercomputers that together had an aggregate peak speed of 19 teraflops. It also more than tripled NCAR's sustained computing capacity when it became fully operational. For a time, Bluefire ranked among the 50 most powerful supercomputers in the world.</P><P>An <mark>IBM</mark> Power 575 supercomputer, Bluefire housed the POWER6 microprocessor, which featured a clock speed of 4.7 gigahertz. The POWER6 chip supported simultaneous multithreading, which increased the speed of many applications run at NCAR by approximately 20%.</P><P>The Bluefire system comprised 4,064 processors in 128 Power 575 nodes. Each node contained four dual-chip modules, each of which contained eight POWER6 processor cores. The system featured more than 12 terabytes of memory, an eight-plane 4xDDR InfiniBand interconnect, and 150 terabytes of FAStT DS4800 disk storage. The disk capacity available to Bluefire users increased to 1.6 petabytes with the deployment of the GLADE central disk resource in August 2010.</P><P>Bluefire relied on a unique, water-based cooling system that was 33 percent more energy efficient than earlier air-cooled systems. Heat was removed from the electronics by water-chilled copper plates mounted in direct contact with each POWER6 microprocessor chip. As a result of this water-cooled system and POWER6 efficiencies, Bluefire was three times more energy efficient per rack than its predecessor.</P><P>Bluefire delivered more 162 million core-hours, running more than 7.3 million individual jobs over its 1,677 days of production service. Its overall availability was just over 97%.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

With headlines proclaiming &quot;water is the new oil,&quot; the race to make desalination a viable solution to worldwide water shortages is on.
</P><P>
In recent years, a number of big-name companies have gotten into the desalination game, including Dow and General Electric, both of which have worked on advanced material membranes for desalination. Today, <mark>IBM</mark> joined the group with its announcement of a pilot desalination project in Saudi Arabia.
</P><P>
Conducted in partnership with a team of researchers from the <A href=""http://www.kacst.edu.sa/en/Pages/default.aspx"">King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology</A>, the <mark>IBM</mark> pilot will test two new technologies from <mark>IBM</mark>'s research team: a nanomaterial membrane that will help to chemically separate water from salt and other elements found in ocean or brackish water, and a concentrated solar system with an innovative cooling mechanism that will allow it to take better advantage of the desert heat and fuel the desalination process with renewable energy.
</P><P>
As is the case with most projects that grow out of Big Blue's research team, these technologies will be tested by <mark>IBM</mark> but commercialized by someone else.
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
	&quot;We are not about to get into the solar business or the membrane business, we're in IT,&quot; explains Sharon Nunes, vice president of <mark>IBM</mark>'s Big Green <mark>Innovation</mark>s.
	</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>
The project gets at one of the primary reasons many environmentalists have long opposed desalination: It's energy intensive.
</P><P><STRONG>
Shifting to Solar</STRONG></P><P>
The vast majority of desalination plants in the world employ a process called reverse osmosis. Either ocean water or brackish water is pushed through a series of membranes at very high pressure, effectively separating water from other elements.
</P><P>
Most companies looking to get into the desalination space, which is all but guaranteed to grow over the next several years, concentrate on the membrane, researching advanced materials that can help to chemically strip water from other elements and thus reduce the pressure requirements for the water coming through the membranes, which in turn reduces the energy requirements of the process.
</P><P>
According to the Encyclopedia of Desalination and Water Resources, the theoretical minimum amount of energy required to desalinate a cubic meter of water is .86 kWh, but the actual energy required in plants throughout the world is five to 26 times that. The theoretical minimum calculates only the energy required to separate water from other elements, not the power required to keep a plant running in general.
</P><P>
That's where the solar power comes in.
</P><P>
Desalination plants and solar energy are a natural fit: More often than not, areas with water shortages also tend to be areas where there's quite a bit of sun. At the <mark>IBM</mark>/KAST Saudi Arabia plant, a solar concentrator system will capture energy equivalent to 1,500 suns, according to <mark>IBM</mark>, powering a plant that will produce 30,000 cubic meters per day of fresh water for a city of 100,000 people.
</P><P>
So why haven't solar-powered desal plants been popping up all over the world?
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
	&quot;Solar is still not at grid parity, and if you're going to build a solar system into a desalination plant, you also need a back-up system in case of cloudy days or dust storms, and all of that is a large additional cost to building a plant,&quot; explains Nunes.
	</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Part of what reduces the cost of solar in this case, according to Nunes, is a proprietary cooling technology that cuts down on system outages and maintenance issues. The liquid metal interface of the system, a technology that grew out of <mark>IBM</mark>'s experience with mainframe computers and chip manufacturing, enables very high cooling rates, according to Nunes, and thus more intense energy capture.
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
	&quot;Usually, the more energy capture, the hotter your solar cell gets, and we're talking about really extreme temperatures, which means you end up with unreliable chips or you burn out your chips entirely, so cooling these systems is very important,&quot; she said.
	</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG>
High-Tech Membranes Increase Efficiency </STRONG></P><P>
According to Nunes, the membranes employed at the Saudi desalination plant will help reduce the plant's energy requirements.
</P><P>
The membrane includes fluorine, which is naturally hydrophobic, but at an adjusted pH that makes it hydrophilic. In layman's terms, through the magic of chemistry, a material that usually repels water now attracts it, which makes it a very effective membrane with which to desalinate water. The material also is resistant to chlorine, which is often used to pre-treat water in purification systems but typically degrades membranes.
</P><P>
The membrane is also more resistant to fouling than other membranes on the market, according to Nunes. The sand, shells, weeds and small sea creatures that can get stuck on membranes means they need to be cleaned fairly often, and when the membranes are at their dirtiest, more energy is required to push water through them at a higher pressure.
</P><P>
Which gets to the other aspects of desalination that environmentalists don't particularly like, aspects that <mark>IBM</mark>'s technology isn't yet focused on: loss of biodiversity in some marine areas and the effect of the briny effluent produced by the desalination process, which is generally dumped back into the original water source.
</P><P><STRONG>
Concerns for Biodiversity </STRONG></P><P>
The brine (a highly salty water that's 10 times saltier than average ocean water) produced by desalination plants has been tested in labs and shown to have little effect on marine life, but the argument from some marine biologists is that in a lab test, fish and other sea life can't get away; while the brine may not kill them, in a real-world scenario they may opt to just leave an area that is suddenly 10 times saltier than it used to be.
</P><P>
The loss of biodiversity is an issue that has largely been pooh-poohed by desalination proponents. There are currently more than <A href=""http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/drinkseawater.html"">12,000</A> desalination plants in the world, and as that number grows, it could have a drastic effect on marine ecosystems as the smallest organisms are routinely sucked into a pump and crushed against membranes.
</P><P>
The current focus on improving energy and water efficiency in desalination plants is a positive one, and replacing coal-powered desalination with solar-powered desalination is imperative, otherwise the &quot;solution&quot; to the water problem is helping to exacerbate one of the causes: <mark>climate change</mark>.
</P><P>
But the idea of efficiency needs to be more broadly applied to the water problem as a whole. One of the reasons that fresh water is at a premium is that much of it has been polluted. In some cases, that renders the water completely undrinkable; in others, in order to drink it, the fresh water needs to be purified in much the same way that saltwater needs to be desalinated, and that process is also energy intensive.
</P><P>
Purification processes need to become more efficient, fresh water stores need to be better protected and technologies that help people use less water and use it more efficiently are still desperately needed. As is the case with energy, solutions to the water shortage need to look at efficiency first and then filling in with &quot;new&quot; water where nothing more can be done on the efficiency front.
</P><P>
As a researcher at the Pacific Institute studying the pros and cons of desalination once put it to me, if you've got a leaky bucket, what's the more logical solution, to just add more water or to plug the holes?
</P><P>

Created in 2012, SOSCIP supports collaborations between academic researchers and small- and medium-sized companies using advanced computing and big data analytics. The ultimate goal is for these projects to bring new products and services to market. </P><H2><A href=""http://news.utoronto.ca/tags/soscip"">Read more about SOSCIP at U of T</A></H2><P>Together with OCE and Mitacs, which will contribute funding to support SOSCIP projects and provide high-tech training opportunities for students and post-doctoral fellows, <mark>IBM</mark>’s latest investment was critical to securing the matching funding required to generate the support of the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario). As a result, SOSCIP is able to launch a major expansion of its activities.</P><P>In addition to the four new areas of focus and new academic members, SOSCIP will place a strategic emphasis on commercialization and partnerships with medium-sized companies to help them adopt advanced computing and big data analytics technologies.  </P><P>“U of T, Western and our SOSCIP colleagues have already benefitted immensely from our partnership with <mark>IBM</mark> Canada. Now, thanks to this additional $65 million investment by <mark>IBM</mark>, SOSCIP has been able to launch its second phase of operations, using state-of-the-art computing to solve critical problems in areas of great social, economic and environmental importance,” said U of T President <STRONG>Meric Gertler</STRONG>. “This latest investment will enable SOSCIP to add new areas of research focus. It will also support more opportunities for students and post-doctoral fellows to gain skills and experience in high-tech settings.” </P><P>SOSCIP was founded with a focus on research into five core areas—cities, health, energy, water and advanced computing. Using state-of-the art technology, such as the <mark>IBM</mark> BlueGene/Q (the fastest supercomputer in Canada and one of the fastest in the world), research has progressed by way of scientists such as U of T Engineering Professor <STRONG>Eric Miller</STRONG>, who is analyzing urban transportation and Professor <STRONG>Richard Peltier</STRONG>, who is investigating <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>In addition to U of T, SOSCIP is co-led by Western University.</P><P>“Western is very proud to co-lead the SOSCIP project with the University of Toronto and its team and we are thrilled to have such a strong relationship with <mark>IBM</mark> as our lead industrial partner,” said Amit Chakma, president of Western University. </P><P>“With this additional investment, we will continue to move ideas into practice by increasing confidence in the digital economy through improved online security, by empowering health professionals to more quickly provide accurate diagnoses and by preparing businesses to identify risks and take advantages of new opportunities. This is where research has impact in our communities.”</P><P>The president of <mark>IBM</mark> Canada, Dino Trevisani, said “We believe one of the best ways to address the <mark>innovation</mark> gap this country is facing is for academia, industry and government to work more collaboratively on common initiatives. Our partnership in SOSCIP is driving Canadian competitiveness and growth by pairing global industry expertise with academia, providing access to technology tools otherwise out of reach and fueling made-in-Canada <mark>innovation</mark> that can move quickly out of the labs and into the market.” </P><P>The other founding partners in SOSCIP are McMaster University, Queen’s University, University of Ottawa, University of Waterloo and the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, <mark>IBM</mark> Canada Ltd. and OCE. Four additional universities joined SOSCIP in April 2014: Carleton, Ryerson, York and Wilfrid Laurier. In August of this year, OCAD University, Seneca College and the University of Windsor also joined the consortium. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Additionally, in the public domain, it will strengthen the understanding of what it takes to protect lives and will help facilitate a more rapid economic recovery.

This investment to advance the field of meteorology and improve global forecasts secures the U.S. reputation as a world leader in atmospheric and water prediction sciences and services.  </DIV></DIV><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body""><DIV class=""pane-content""><DIV class=""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden""><DIV class=""field-items""><DIV class=""field-item even""><P>The computers — called Luna and Surge — are located at computing centers in Reston, Virginia and Orlando, Florida. They are now running at 2.89 petaflops each for a new total of 5.78 petaflops of operational computing capacity, up from 776 teraflops of processing power last year. </P><P>“This significant investment in our operational supercomputers equips us to handle the tidal wave of data that new observing platforms will generate and allows us to push our science and operations into exciting new territory, said Kathryn Sullivan, Ph.D., NOAA’s administrator. “The faster runs and better spatial and temporal resolution that Luna and Surge provide will allow NOAA to improve our environmental intelligence dramatically, giving the public faster and better predictions of weather, water and <mark>climate change</mark>. This enhanced environmental intelligence is vital to supporting the nation’s physical safety and economic security.” </P><P>Sullivan said the ultimate goal of investment in operational and research supercomputing capacity is to build resilient communities in the United States by arming people with reliable environmental intelligence to make good decisions, as NOAA works to build a Weather-Ready Nation.</P><P>The increase in supercomputing strength will allow NOAA to roll out a series operational model upgrades throughout 2016. For example:</P><UL><LI>Upgrades to the High Resolution Rapid Refresh Model (HRRR) will help meteorologists predict the amount, timing and type of precipitation in winter storms and the timing location and structure severe thunderstorms.</LI><LI>Implementation of a new National Water Model will expand the National Weather Service’s current water quantity forecasts at 4,000 locations to forecasts of flow, soil moisture, snow water equivalent, evapotranspiration, runoff and other parameters for 2.7 million river and stream locations across the country, representing a 700-fold increase in spatial density. This new information, provided nationally at the neighborhood scale, will enable forecasters to more accurately predict droughts and floods, and better support water resources decisions. </LI><LI>Upgrades to the Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting Model (HWRF) will mark the first time NOAA models have had direct connections between the air, ocean and waves to improve forecasts of hurricane tracks and intensity. This upgrade will increase the number of storms NOAA can forecast for at any given time to 8.</LI></UL><P>The increase in supercomputing capacity comes via a $44.5 million investment using NOAA's operational high performance computing contract with <mark>IBM</mark>, $25 million of which was provided through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 related to the consequences of Hurricane Sandy. Cray Inc., headquartered in Seattle, serves as a subcontractor for <mark>IBM</mark> providing the new systems to NOAA.</P><P>NOAA’s mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment, from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun, and to conserve and manage our coastal and marine resources.

A cornerstone of the <A href=""https://www.greenbiz.com/microsite/102837/article/good-copbad-cop-how-business-fared-paris-agreement"">Paris Agreement</A> coming out of the <A href=""https://www.greenbiz.com/microsite/cop21"">U.N. COP21 <mark>climate</mark> talks</A> was investing in renewable energy, such as solar and wind, alongside energy efficiency.</P><P>Want to be a part of expanding the renewables economy? Here are 10 nifty apps for businesses and consumers alike.</P><H3><A href=""https://www.mapdwell.com/en"">1. Mapdwell</A></H3><P>What's the solar potential of your town ? This app, developed by MIT researchers, maps the solar potential of entire cities by doing a cost-benefit analysis for every rooftop. Enter an address, and Mapdwell estimates installation costs, the number of years it will take to earn back this investment, the amount of <mark>carbon</mark> offset by the installation, and detailed installment specs such as the optimal panel tilt and the number of panels to fit on the roof.</P><P>Mapdwell has mapped a handful of cities across the U.S. and Chile, with plans for every major U.S. metro area by the end of 2016.</P><H3><A href=""https://www.google.com/get/sunroof#exp=7.1&amp;p=0"">2. Project Sunroof</A></H3><P>For getting from Point A to Point B you may already turn to Google Maps, which Project Sunroof Google aims to leverage to advance solar energy. Sunroof gives homeowners details about how much solar power their roof can generate and how much money they could save on electricity by installing solar. Its 3D modeling calculates the amount of space on a building’s roof for solar panels, and analyzes the positioning of the sun over the course of a year, accounting for the type of cloud cover and temperature in the neighborhood.</P><P>Launched in August in San Francisco, Fresno and Boston, Sunroof recently expanded to 42 states, and can analyze around 43 million rooftops. Now tens of millions of potential solar customers can Google their own rooftops for solar suitability.</P><H3><A href=""https://www.iapps4you.com/iphone_ipad_apps/248442_windspire_me.html#.V1BSemboEQ1"">3. Windspire Me</A></H3><P>This nifty, if slightly dated, app allows you to measure wind speeds with a smartphone, estimating what a Windspire wind turbine could power and how much <mark>CO2</mark> could be saved. Tap the &quot;Check my wind&quot; button and hold the phone up with the microphone facing the wind. You can the post the speed to a map and share it with others.</P><P>While this isn’t much more than a creative marketing tool for wind turbine producer <A href=""http://www.windspireenergy.com/"">Windspire</A>, it also serves to generate public interest in wind energy by directly showing the positive environmental dividends of embracing wind power.</P><H3><A href=""http://www.greenbuttondata.org/"">4. Green Button</A></H3><P>This technically isn’t an app but an open data initiative launched by the energy industry in response to a White House call to action. Yet Green Button enables households and businesses to use web and smartphone apps more easily to pick the best rate plan for themselves; to take advantage of customized energy efficiency tips; to use easy-to-use tools to size and finance rooftop solar panels; and to download virtual energy audit software that can cut costs for building owners and help start retrofits sooner.</P><P>SolarCity is integrating Green Button Connect My Data into its sales consultations to help customers assess the potential of solar energy to reduce home energy consumption and bills. Likewise, ChargePoint is using Green Button to report energy consumption data to utilities from its electric vehicle charging stations.</P><H3><A href=""https://www-03.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/press/us/en/photo/44326.wss"">5. <mark>IBM</mark>’s HyRef</A></H3><P><mark>IBM</mark>'s &quot;Hybrid Renewable Energy Forecasting&quot; (HyRef) system aims to help utilities increase the reliability of renewable energy by combining weather prediction and analytics to forecast the availability of wind power and solar energy. The idea is to then help utilities integrate more renewable energy into the power grid, helping to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions while significantly boosting clean energy output.</P><H3><A href=""http://irena.masdar.ac.ae/"">6. Global Atlas</A></H3><P>This free smartphone app allows businesses and individuals to calculate the renewable energy generation potential of a given location. <A href=""https://www.greenbiz.com/article/calculating-your-renewable-energy-potential-theres-app"">Launched</A> in 2015 by the International Renewable Energy Agency, it allows renewable energy &quot;prospectors&quot; and investors to comprehensively research projects before making early investment decisions. It draws on data from 1,000 maps provided by 67 governments and 50 data centers.</P><H3><A href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/windfarm-locator/id867440338?ls=1&amp;mt=8"">7. Windfarm Locator</A></H3><P>This app turns an iPhone or iPad into a global wind farm-monitoring platform, which lets you see real-time renewable energy production from turbines around the world. Overall, tens of thousands of wind farms on the app span from the United States to Germany and beyond.</P><P>One interesting feature is being able to find nearby wind farms using a feature that shows real-time production data. The app also colors the wind farms according to size, offers capacity information, shows the number and model of turbines, indicates estimated electricity production per year for each and estimates the number of homes that electricity could power.</P><H3><A href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/solar-checklist/id688633696?ls=1&amp;mt=8"">8. Solar Checklist</A></H3><P>From the Clean Energy Council, this app is designed to make it easier for solar installers and businesses to track their jobs, to perform high quality installation work and to cut down on administration. It includes details for each step of a solar installation, and lets you record and verify that every job has been installed to standards.</P><P>Solar Checklist incorporates a barcode scanner, up-to-date technical help and a way of linking photos. Overall, the app helps solar installers document the details of each solar installation, provides handy prompts and can save time and paperwork.</P><H3><A href=""//oaspub.epa.gov/powpro/ept_pack.charts"">9. Power Profiler</A></H3><P>Input a ZIP code, and the EPA Power Profiler tool lets you compare the fuel mix and air emissions rates of the electricity to the national average and determine the air emissions impacts of electricity use. However, the Power Profiler does not provide information about the environmental attributes of electric power generated by individual companies.</P><H3><A href=""https://www.epa.gov/energy/egrid"">10. eGRID</A></H3><P>Another offering of the EPA, the Emissions &amp; Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) is a comprehensive source of data on the environmental characteristics of almost all electric power generated in the United States. This includes air emissions for nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide; emissions rates; net generation; resource mix; and many other attributes.</P><P>eGRID data can be used for greenhouse gas registries and inventories, <mark>carbon</mark> footprints, consumer information disclosure, emission inventories and standards, power market changes and averted emissions estimates.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""field field-name-field-greenbiz-topics-ref field-type-entityreference field-label-inline clearfix""><DIV class=""field-label"">Topics: </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Thanks to AI, our speech will be a window into our mental health</STRONG></P><P>You can tell a lot about someone based on how they talk - whether they're bored, flustered, distracted, or miserable.</P><P>As humans, we've evolved to pick up these cues, but rapid advancements being made in computer processing power means speech analysis is about to become a whole lot more insightful.</P><P><A href=""http://www.research.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/5-in-5/mental-health/""><mark>IBM</mark> predicts</A> that in five years, &quot;What we say and write will be used as indicators of our mental health and physical wellbeing.&quot;</P><DIV class=""priad-mobile-spacer""> </DIV><P>For example, mental illness and diseases such as Parkinson's could be spotted sooner with a mobile phone app, thanks to AI calculations being done in the cloud, and the earlier we spot these conditions, the better placed we are to treat them.</P><P>It might sound like a stretch to link speech cues to symptoms of disease, but experimental systems such as this are already appearing.</P><P><A href=""/this-computer-program-can-tell-when-someone-s-depressed-by-their-speech-patterns"">Last year,</A> a team from the University of Southern California built a program that was able to detect variations from normal speech patterns and identify signs of depression.</P><P><STRONG>2. Superhero vision will be possible with AI and powerful new devices</STRONG></P><P>Our eyes are fantastic pieces of biological equipment, but <A href=""http://www.research.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/5-in-5/hyperimaging/"">according to <mark>IBM</mark></A>, powerful, tiny cameras combined with the fast processing smarts of AI mean we'll be able to see more than ever before by 2022.</P><P>As well as visible light, we could see <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_imaging"">microwave</A>, <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimeter_wave_scanner"">millimetre wave</A>, and <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"">infrared</A> images through devices small enough to fit in your pocket or clip onto your shades - think the visual capabilities of something like an airport security scanner, but in a device the size of your phone.</P><P>Using this kind of technology, you could instantly see whether food is safe to eat, and it could give self-driving cars the capacity to see through fog or rain much more easily.</P><P>The first of these devices are already appearing, <A href=""/watch-a-colourblind-guy-freak-out-when-he-sees-colour-for-the-first-time"">like the EnChroma sunglasses</A> that help colour blind people see colour for the first time.</P><P>Right now, they're expensive and experimental, but by 2022, they could be commonplace.</P><P><STRONG>3. 'Macroscopes' will help us understand Earth's complexity in infinite detail</STRONG></P><P>Thanks to satellite imagery, being able to see a bird's eye view <A href=""/google-timelapse-now-lets-you-see-how-any-location-on-earth-has-changed-in-32-years"">of anywhere on Earth</A> feels normal - but Google Earth is just the beginning. </P><P><A href=""http://www.research.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/5-in-5/macroscopes/""><mark>IBM</mark> predicts</A> that &quot;macroscope&quot; systems - like microscopes, but at the other end of the scale - are going to combine &quot;all of Earth's complex data together&quot;, so we can analyse it from all kinds of new perspectives.</P><P>Not only will this technology provide us with more data from satellites, smart sensors, and weather stations, it will offer much better ways to organise and sort through it all.</P><P>This technology wouldn't just apply to natural processes on Earth and beyond - all kinds of devices, including our lights and fridges, could be studied using macroscopes of the future to predict everything from <mark>climate change</mark> trends to the best ways of distributing food to various communities around the globe.</P><P>From <A href=""/this-crazy-cyber-attack-shows-that-even-our-light-bulbs-aren-t-safe-from-hackers"">remote-controlled lightbulbs</A> to <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo#Available_services"">'smart' speakers</A> that can record your shopping lists and look up Wikipedia for you, many more devices in homes and across cities are getting smarter and more connected, so imagine the potential of being able to sift through all that data in a more intelligent way.</P><P><STRONG>4. 'Labs on a chip' will revolutionise medicine</STRONG></P><P>As computing technology shrinks and gets more and more powerful, the medical benefits could be huge, <A href=""http://www.research.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/5-in-5/nanotech-for-healthcare/""><mark>IBM</mark> predicts</A>. Imagine during accurate dignoses in your home, at a low cost, to catch diseases earlier than ever.</P><P>&quot;New medical labs on a chip will serve as nanotechnology health detectives - tracing invisible clues in our bodily fluids and letting us know immediately if we have reason to see a doctor,&quot; <A href=""http://www.research.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/5-in-5/nanotech-for-healthcare/"">explains <mark>IBM</mark></A>.</P><P>In other words, a full biochemistry lab in the palm of your hand.</P><P>Detecting diseases such as cancer or Parkinson's in their early stages can make a <A href=""/parkinson-s-could-be-predicted-in-advance-by-a-simple-eye-test"">big difference</A> to <A href=""/new-eye-test-can-detect-glaucoma-4-years-before-current-tests"">how successful</A> treatments are, which is why scientists are working to improve analysis of our tears, blood, urine, and sweat.</P><P>By 2022, your sleep tracker and fitness band could be feeding back data to an AI system in the cloud, and with that information, you could access detailed advice about how to improve your health, while also remotely alerting your doctor to any warning signs of impending disease.</P><P><STRONG>5. Smart sensors will detect environmental <mark>pollution</mark> faster than ever</STRONG></P><P><A href=""http://www.research.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/5-in-5/environmental-pollutants/""><mark>IBM</mark> predicts</A> that the mix of smart hardware and AI analysis featured in its other predictions could also be used to detect environmental <mark>pollution</mark> almost instantly.</P><P>Just as a smart tracker could spot early signs of disease in the human body, smart sensors embedded in the ground or fitted to drones could detect pollutants and emissions in real-time, without having to transfer samples back to a lab.</P><P>One example of this is <A href=""https://www.edf.org/energy/methaneleakage"">methane leaks</A> - invisible to the naked eye, and estimated to be the second largest <A href=""/scientists-just-discovered-a-major-new-source-of-greenhouse-gases"">contributor to global warming</A> after <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide.</P><P>Smart sensors located along pipelines, around storage facilities, and near natural wells will be able to raise the alarm about leaks quicker than ever before.</P><P>Such leaks could be &quot;found in a matter of minutes instead of weeks&quot;, <A href=""http://www.research.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/5-in-5/environmental-pollutants/"">explains <mark>IBM</mark></A>, &quot;reducing <mark>pollution</mark> and waste and the likelihood of catastrophic events&quot;.</P><P>As we mentioned above, predicting the future is notoriously tricky, but these kinds of technologies are already well into development by research teams all over the world, so it's really just a question of when we get there.</P><P>Let's hope things are even more awesome in 2022, thanks to whatever amazing tech scientists can come up with.</P><P>Because the Universe is set to give us <A href=""/here-s-why-a-bright-new-star-could-be-appearing-in-the-night-sky-in-2022"">a bright new 'star' in the night sk</A>y by then, so let's see if we can top that.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""article-latest""><DIV class=""moduletable""><H3>More From ScienceAlert</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Rather, it's a crucial source of <mark>climate</mark> information and reminders about indisputable physical phenomena in an era when even the most basic facts are under attack.</P><P>To learn more about <A href=""http://weather.com"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">weather.com</A>'s editorial direction in 2017, we spoke to the website's editor-in-chief of nearly five years, Neil Katz. The former executive editor of the Huffington Post and <A href=""http://CBSNews.com"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">CBSNews.com</A>, Katz now leads an editorial team of 60 people at TWC. He spoke to us on the phone about The Weather Channel's new vision for its homepage, its relationship to politics, and the big stories its reporters are tracking right now.</P><P><STRONG>To start off, tell me a little bit about what inspired the &quot;</STRONG><STRONG>AMERICA, THIS IS STILL HAPPENING</STRONG><STRONG>&quot; headline on Friday and the coverage of Hurricane Maria on the homepage.</STRONG></P><P>This story is a slow-moving, ongoing tragedy, and just because the hurricane-force winds and crashing waves have left <A href=""https://psmag.com/social-justice/puerto-rico-was-undergoing-a-humanitarian-crisis-long-before-hurricane-maria"">Puerto Rico</A> doesn't mean the story has left. A lot of the news media has moved on—that's the [news] world we live in, it's a fast cycle. But we wanted to make very clear to everybody that we should still be paying attention. These are Americans, and, 30 days later, they're still in trouble. We thought it was [important] to dedicate our page to what they're going through.</P><P><STRONG>Coverage of the headline on Friday reminded me of</STRONG><STRONG> the site's decision to plaster <mark>climate</mark>-change coverage on the homepage on the day Trump announced the U.S. was </STRONG><A href=""https://psmag.com/environment/donald-trumps-dangerous-nationalist-rhetoric-on-<mark>climate</mark>""><STRONG>pulling out</STRONG></A><STRONG> of the Paris Agreement. What was the thinking behind that decision?</STRONG></P><P>We discovered that, if we think about our website almost like a magazine, where the cover of a magazine has real power and when you devote an entire issue of a magazine to an issue, people pay attention. It turns out we can do the same thing with the homepage of <A href=""http://weather.com"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">weather.com</A>. We don't do it a lot, and we don't do any political grandstanding as much as people might have thought that's what was going on that day, but when there are big issues that matter to America and the world and The Weather Channel, we think it's worth devoting all of our reporting efforts to an issue and explaining that to the public. The things we care about are obviously <A href=""https://psmag.com/economics/there-are-no-natural-disasters"">breaking weather news</A> and <A href=""https://psmag.com/social-justice/what-harvey-and-irma-taught-about-using-social-media-in-emergency-response"">keeping people safe during storms</A>, but also <A href=""https://psmag.com/series/cccc-303""><mark>climate change</mark></A>, <A href=""https://psmag.com/environment/so-much-for-pristine-bay"">environmental degradation</A>, and <A href=""https://psmag.com/news/to-make-this-land-home-again"">aftermath</A>. We think it's certainly worth giving an entire day's worth of coverage to issues that matter.</P><P><STRONG>As you said, you are working with <mark>climate</mark> facts, but some of these are politicized issues. To what extent do you consider how politics affects <mark>climate</mark> and the weather when you're planning out your news coverage?</STRONG></P><P>Somewhere between 0 and 0 percent.</P><DIV class=""m-detail--body-item""><FIGURE class=""l-wrap-left tml-image m-detail--tml-image--left"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/ImageObject""><FIGCAPTION><P class=""tml-image--caption"" itemprop=""caption"">Neil Katz.</P><P class=""tml-image--attribution"" itemprop=""author""><SPAN>(Photo: Twitter)</SPAN></P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><P><STRONG>Why is that? </STRONG></P><P>If you want to argue about politics, there are so many great places to do that, but we don't need to be another outlet for that. We hope the weather is at least one of the things we can agree should be apolitical. It's hard to make fake news when you see the wind and rain outside your window. That's just real. Certainly <mark>climate change</mark> is an issue that has become politicized, but we are not focused on that part of it, we are focused on the science of <mark>climate change</mark>, the causes of <mark>climate change</mark>, and the weather-based impacts that affect millions of people. We think there's plenty of news to cover in those three buckets without getting into the echo chamber that everyone else is so thoroughly saturated with.</P><P><STRONG>Right, but your decision to devote your homepage to <mark>climate change</mark> on the day Trump said the U.S. was leaving the Paris Agreement felt politically pointed. Has The Weather Channel's website had to <A href=""https://psmag.com/news/the-trick-to-debunking-fake-news"">advocate more for facts</A> since Trump became president?</STRONG></P><P>From our perspective, issues like <mark>climate change</mark> or an aftermath that an entire island of three million people is facing are so much bigger than who sits in the White House. We just don't feel that we have to focus on the political rat race of it, which is so well covered everywhere else. </P><P>People will read into it what they do. Certainly because we report on the science that says <mark>climate change</mark> is real and an increasing danger, we took a stance that doing less to work on <mark>climate change</mark> wasn't a good idea. But [as for analyzing] the politics of that decision, or who should make that decision in the White House, we don't feel that's our place.</P><P><STRONG>Accordingly, I would imagine your readership is quite bipartisan: What are your site's political demographics like? Do you know off the top of your head?</STRONG></P><P>I don't; that's not something we've ever polled or focus-grouped. About 250 million people a month use our properties, so that's a lot of everybody. And when we run these stories, we find people with very strong opinions on both sides of it. And that's kind of nice, actually. It's nice to do news that's not just for the congregation of the converted, regardless of what you're talking about. It's not a bad thing to have a little bit of everybody on the site.</P><P><STRONG>So you're not worried about estranging particular segments of your readership?</STRONG></P><P>I don't know. I mean, when we do these stories, that's certainly not our focus, to figure out who's going to be happy or not with the weather and reporting. We think it's important news, and want to get it to people.</P><P><STRONG>What has the feedback been like so far for the Hurricane Maria coverage that you did on Friday?</STRONG></P><P>For the most part positive. It's certainly less controversial than <mark>climate change</mark> is, and I think just about everyone who comes to the site and sees us focus on the suffering of Americans that needs to addressed, it's hard to get upset about that. It's been very positive.</P><P><STRONG>Most people probably think of </STRONG><A href=""http://weather.com"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank""><STRONG>weather.com</STRONG></A><STRONG> as a place to get their local forecast; do you want to reframe how your site is viewed?</STRONG></P><P>We've always been a utility and a place for weather news. If you go back to when the channel began 35 years ago on television, in some ways it functioned like an app does today. Every 10 minutes you'd get local weather data. And in between that you'd get explanation, you'd get breaking weather news coverage to keep you safe during the biggest storms, and perhaps surprisingly—to go back to the archives—you would also see stories about the effects of <mark>pollution</mark>, stories about how weather was affecting agricultural business or how the weather was affecting different parts of the country differently. So we're certainly famous for being a real-time utility where you can check your weather every day. So that's great, and we're happy to have those customers. We also have a three-decade history of doing big breaking news when it matters to our fans.</P><P><STRONG>So in other words, you're kind of doing what you've always done?</STRONG></P><P>We think we're doing it in a sharper way today, but what we're doing is I think pretty much in line with the history of the company and the spiritual DNA of The Weather Channel brand.</P><P><STRONG>As you continue to move forward with your coverage, what are the big stories that you and your reporters are tracking right now?</STRONG></P><P>The No. 1 story for us is always keeping people safe from severe weather. So, yes, we're coming out of hurricane season but we'll be moving into winter storms and tornado season—so that's always No. 1 what everyone's mobilized against. When those are slow, we're able to focus much more on <mark>climate change</mark> both on a global basis and how it affects Americans directly. We are about three-quarters through a giant reporting project this year called the <A href=""http://features.weather.com/us-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" phx-track-event="""" target=""_blank"">United States of <mark>Climate Change</mark></A>: We do a story on how <mark>climate</mark> is affecting every state in the country. It's been a huge, year-long commitment across the entire reporting team. And of course environmental degradation, we're definitely interested in environmental legislation, the hot debate about the role of regulation to protect the environment or to make things easier for some businesses, we're very interested in that topic as well. And we're deeply interested in the science behind it all. I think that's what makes us unique: Take any one of these issues, and what is the latest scientific and research and facts that can help us make really good decisions about these topics?</P><P><STRONG>Do you plan on using these magazine-like covers going forward?</STRONG></P><P>We do.</P><P><EM>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</EM></P><P><EM><STRONG>*Update — October 24th, 2017</STRONG>: This story has been updated to reflect <mark>IBM</mark>'s ownership of weather.com.</EM></P></DIV><FOOTER class=""m-detail--footer""><DIV class=""m-detail--meta""><DL><DT class=""m-detail--label"">Tags</DT></DL></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Image courtesy of Wikipedia</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV itemprop=""articleBody"" class=""article-body""><DIV class=""standfirst""><P><mark>IBM</mark> has identified the five <mark>innovation</mark>s the computer technology company believes will change our world within the next five years.
</P></DIV><P>The ‘<mark>IBM</mark> 5 in 5’ include artificial intelligence helping to better understand our mental health, hyperimaging and AI will give us superhero vision, macroscopes helping us to understand Earth’s complexity in infinite detail, medical labs “on a chip” will serve as health detectives for tracing disease at the nanoscale, and smart sensors will detect environmental <mark>pollution</mark> at the speed of light.</P><P><mark>IBM</mark> predicts that with artificial intelligence, our words will be a window into our mental health, and that in five years what we say and write will be used as indicators of our mental health and physical well being.</P><P>This will be achieved through the use of cognitive computers which will analyse the patient’s speech or written words to look for tell-tale indicators found in language, including meaning, syntax, and intonation.</P><P>The results of these measurements from cognitive computers combined with measurements gained from wearable devices and imaging devices (MRIs and EEG’s) will allow once invisible signs will become clear signals of a patient’s likelihood of entering a certain mental state, and will give health professionals a better understanding of how to treat the underlying mental disease.</P><P>If this <mark>IBM</mark> prediction becomes reality, it could address the global issue of mental health conditions, which are expected to cost over $6t by 2030.</P><P><mark>IBM</mark> also predicts that hyper imaging and artificial intelligence (A.I) will give us superhero vision in five years.</P><P>This will be achieved by new imaging devices using hyper imaging technology and AI to see broadly beyond the domain of visible light by combining multiple bands of the electromagnetic spectrum to reveal valuable insights or potential dangers that would otherwise be unknown or hidden from view.</P><P>More than 99.9% of the electromagnetic spectrum cannot be seen by the naked eye, with instruments in existence which do this such as for use in medicine and security, but which are incredibly specialized and expensive.</P><P>The new predicted technology could solve this problem by offering a portable, affordable and accessible device, thus introducing this ‘superhero vision’ technology into everyday use.</P><P>According to the ‘<mark>IBM</mark> 5 in 5’, by 2022 macroscopes will help us understand Earth’s complexity in infinite detail.</P><P><mark>IBM</mark> predicts that in five years we will use machine-learning algorithms and software to help us organize the information about the physical world to help bring the vast and complex data gathered by billions of devices within the range of our vision and understanding.</P><P><mark>IBM</mark> calls this understanding of data a ‘macroscope’– a system of software and algorithms to help bring all of Earth’s complex data together to analyze it by space and time for meaning.</P><P>Most of the world’s data is currently unorganized with new sources of data from millions of connected objects pouring in from the Internet of Things.</P><P>Macroscope technology will help to address this data problem while also transforming many industries in that the organization and analyzing of data will reveal the problems humanity faces, such as <mark>climate change</mark> and the availability of food and water.</P><P>Another prediction by <mark>IBM</mark> is that in five years new medical labs on a chip will serve as nanotechnology health detectives by tracing invisible clues in our bodily fluids and letting us know immediately if we have any reason to see a doctor.</P><P>The goal of this potential <mark>innovation</mark> is to shrink down into one single silicon chip all of the processes necessary to analyze a disease that would normally be carried out in a full-scale biochemistry lab.</P><P>This lab-on-a-chip technology could be a groundbreaking <mark>innovation</mark> in that it could ultimately be packaged in a convenient handheld device to allow people to quickly and regularly measure the presence of biomarkers found in small amounts of bodily fluids and then sending this information securely streaming into the cloud from the convenience of their home.</P><P>This information could then be combined with real-time health data from other IoT-enabled devices such as sleep monitors and smart watches.</P><P>This data would then give the user an in-depth view of our health and alert us to the first signs of trouble to help stop the disease before it progresses.</P><P>The lab-on-a-chip technology will help solve the current problem of some diseases such as cancer or Parkinson’s being hard to detect, in that they lie hiding in our bodies before symptoms appear.</P><P>Currently, information about the state of our health can be extracted from tiny bioparticles in body fluids, but are difficult to capture and analyze due to their minuscule size.</P><P>The medical labs on a chip are predicted to solve this problem by identifying these clues in our bodily fluid by condensing the capacity of a lab into one silicon chip.</P><P>The fifth prediction by <mark>IBM</mark> states that smart sensors will detect environmental <mark>pollution</mark> at the speed of light.</P><P>They predict that in five years new affordable sensing technologies deployed near natural as extraction wells, around storage facilities, and along distribution pipelines will enable the industry to pinpoint invisible leaks in real-time.</P><P>Networks of IoT sensors wirelessly connected to the cloud will provide continuous monitoring of the vast natural gas infrastructure, allowing leaks to be found in a matter of minutes instead of weeks, reducing <mark>pollution</mark> and waste and the likelihood of catastrophic events.</P><P>These smart sensors will be able to address the problem that exists in that most pollutants are invisible to the human eye, such as methane which is estimated to be the second-largest contributor to global warming after <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide.</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV><ASIDE class=""site-sidebar

But now <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/28/technology/<mark>ibm</mark>-inch-closer-on-quantum-computer.html?_r=1"" target=""_blank""><mark>IBM</mark> believes</A> it’s made progress in developing quantum computers, which don’t use binary coding. It is not overstating the matter to say this really may be the ultimate answer in computing machines. Quick, mop your brow and don’t worry: The science isn’t too hard to grasp and the revolution, when it comes, could rock the world. In a very good way.</P><P>First, a little background: Computers today, everything from the chip controlling your washing machine cycle to the screen you’re reading this on, rely on binary math to work. This reduces the information in problems you ask a computer to a counting system based on just “1”s and “0”s. That translates beautifully into the electronics of a computer circuit: A “1” matches up with a little burst of electricity, a “0” means none. By shuttling trillions upon trillions of these pulses, called bits, through tiny silicon circuits and transistor gates that flip their direction or trigger an ongoing signal, the chip does math with these ones and zeros. It’s a mind-bogglingly complex and very swift dance that ultimately results in <EM>Angry Birds</EM> playing on the screen of your iPad. Or, after kajillions of calculations more in a supercomputer, it results in a model predicting <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Now, what if instead of simply being able to do math with ones and zeros, a computer chip could work with bits that included other numbers? You’d have to design more complex circuitry, for sure, but it means every single one of those tiny electronic calculations that’s happening every millisecond could tackle more information at once, and would ultimately mean a more powerful computer that may calculate faster. Got that? Good. Now how about if instead of a one or a zero, your computer’s “bits” could have any one of an infinite number of values? </P><P>That’s quantum computing. Essentially this moves way beyond the well-known physics of electronics, and on into the weird and wonderful world of quantum physics–where bizarre twists of the laws of the universe mean a “bit” in a quantum computer could hold both a “1” and a “0” and any other value at the same time. That means the circuits of a quantum computer could carry out an incredibly huge number of calculations at the same time, handling more information at once than you can possibly imagine.</P><P>By using some other very strange physics (superconducting materials cooled to hundreds of degrees below freezing) <mark>IBM</mark>’s research team is trying to build some of the core components of a quantum computer, and has made big progress. They’re now saying they’ve made the quantum “bits” of information, also called qubits, live a lot longer before they essentially get scrambled. They’ve also worked out how to speed up the actual quantum computing circuit. <mark>IBM</mark>’s progress is so impressive that they’re now confident a quantum computer could be made sooner rather than later, perhaps as close as 15 years away.</P><P>Whenever it arrives, the world will change.</P></DIV><DIV class=""ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_1""><DIV class=""ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap""><DIV class=""ad-wrapper__ad-slug"">advertisement</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV><P>On a very simple level, this is because instead of asking a supercomputer to work with endless strings of “1”s and “0”s to calculate all the variables in, say, a global warming simulation (performing trillions of small math calculations one after the other to work out the dynamics of the <mark>climate</mark> over a period of hours or days) a quantum computer would be able to process much of the math at the same instant instead of sequentially. Which could reduce the compute time to a second or less. Which ultimately means better and more accurate models of the <mark>climate</mark>. Similar processing tricks could improve medical imaging, or maybe even simulations of your own particular disease’s spread, which may improve treatment.</P><P>And there are many ways this tech would touch your life on an everyday basis, as well. Tasks like image recognition in <A href=""//www.fastcompany.com/company/google "">Google</A><A title="" "" href=""//www.fastcompany.com/1640181/google-goggles-app-translates-the-real-world-so-you-can-remain-monolingual-forever"" target=""_blank"">Goggles</A> or voice recognition in <A href=""//www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2012/apple "" target=""_blank"">Apple’s</A><A href=""//www.fastcompany.com/1788343/9-questions-to-ask-siri"" target=""_blank"">Siri</A> rely on whisking your data off to a powerful computer, running it through a process, and sending you the results back (identifying that photo of a building as the Eiffel tower, or answering your question about the rain in Spain). These recognition problems are partly based on how good the recognition algorithm is, but also on how much time the computer can afford to spend on your problem. A quantum computer would work so swiftly that there would be no issues with spending more time trying to accurately understand your query, meaning we could reach near-perfect image and voice recognition. Perhaps even in real time, from a video feed. Imagine the sort of augmented reality tech that that would enable, with a <A href=""//www.fastcompany.com/1818541/follow-up-googles-goggles-get-plausible"" target=""_blank"">head-up display</A> on your view of the world constantly delivering relevant info about everything you see.</P><P>Then think about security–most encryption systems nowadays rely on clever math that means they couldn’t be cracked even by a supercomputer running for years. A quantum computer could try every single combination of passwords to crack the security in a single second, which is pretty terrible news. That’s going to force all sorts of changes with how we protect information, and yet it could also lead to more secure encryption, made by a quantum computer. There’s also the matter of surveillance: Recognizing every word of every phone conversation on the planet and identifying every single face on every CCTV image would defeat all of today’s supercomputer power…but maybe a quantum computer could do it. George Orwell would’ve loved that. Also on the dark side, ponder how insurance firms would use or abuse this phenomenal power (“our simulation says it’s 75% more plausible the accident was your fault”), or how worried nations could simulate social dynamics to <A href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20117058-281/homeland-security-moves-forward-with-pre-crime-detection/"" target=""_blank"">try to predict crime</A>.</P><P>Next, on the lighter side, consider art. Or at least the movies. Look at computer graphics in films: The computers in render farms that companies like Pixar use to make <EM><A href=""http://pixarplanet.com/blog/first-look-rendered-brave-image"" target=""_blank"">Brave</A></EM> take hours to put together a single frame, and that limits how truly amazing the image can be made. A quantum computer could tackle a render of today’s Pixar movies in a blink of an eye. And that has all sorts of implications, maybe meaning CGI actors could be even more realistic.</P><P>Which leads on to artificial intelligence–a sci-fi promise that’s so far been very difficult to make real, although <mark>IBM</mark>’s Watson has <A href=""//www.fastcompany.com/1728740/inside-<mark>ibm</mark>s-jeopardy-winning-watson-supercomputer"" target=""_blank"">recently wowed</A> everyone. What if quantum computing suddenly enabled such swift, complex calculations that a system like Watson or Siri could talk back to you convincingly, reading the nuances in your voice enough to ask, as a friend might, if you’re a little stressed today and wondering if they could help?</P><P>Quantum computers won’t necessarily be able to speed up solving every class of problem you throw at them, but it’s undeniable that they’ll change modern life in many ways, at times small, at others great. As for questions on life, the universe, and everything? Those still require the human element to try to answer.</P></DIV><DIV class=""ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_2""><DIV class=""ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap""><DIV class=""ad-wrapper__ad-slug"">advertisement</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV><P>[<EM>Image: Flickr user <A href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/ruthhb/2621930333"" target=""_blank"">Ruth Flickr</A></EM><EM>and <A href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/jannem/2357169829"" target=""_blank"">Janne Moren</A></EM>]</P></DIV></ARTICLE><FOOTER class=""post__footer""><DIV class=""author author--post""><H4 class=""author__title"">About the author</H4><P class=""author__description"">I'm covering the science/tech/generally-exciting-and-innovative beat for Fast Company.

They tout specific green projects, like solar roofs and increased efficiency. But when it comes time to report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the same companies stick to broad terminology and sanded-down statements.</P><P>Take Target Corp., which outlined some of its efforts to become more <mark>climate</mark>-friendly in its 2015 sustainability <A href=""https://corporate.target.com/_media/TargetCorp/csr/pdf/2015-Corporate-Social-Responsibility-Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">report</A>: solar panels, smart-grid technology, low-power stores, recycling programs and a recent pledge made at the White House to cut greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>Or <mark>IBM</mark>, which issued a detailed <mark>climate</mark> report last year, too, telling a nonprofit that energy efficiency standards for computer products present a “high” financial cost that would be “virtually certain” to affect the tech giant within a year.</P><P>Even though information for both companies is publicly available—and could sway someone from buying or selling Target or <mark>IBM</mark> stock—none of it is on file at the SEC. And the imabalance is widespread.</P><P>A <EM><mark>Climate</mark>Wire</EM> examination of corporate documents, congressional audits and independent reports, along with interviews with investors, former SEC employees and congressional staffers, shows a disparity in what companies say about <mark>climate change</mark> and where they say it.</P><P>In fact, analysts say, for investors interested in managing the economic risks of <mark>climate change</mark>, the SEC is among the least helpful places to look.</P><P>“Often companies will put information out in news releases or sustainability reports,” said Warren Lavey, a law and environmental sciences professor at the University of Illinois, “and yet that information doesn’t find its way into the SEC filings.”</P><H2>Disclosure through other means</H2><P>U.S. law requires public companies to tell shareholders of substantial events that relate to their business, such as lawsuits, financial performance and overall business trends.</P><P>Those data culminate in annual reports, known as 10-Ks, which are snapshots of U.S. companies’ performance. They are documents that Wall Street analysts, investors and consultants rely on to evaluate the world economy.</P><P>Yet as governments, businesses and individuals worldwide try to grapple the risks of <mark>climate change</mark>, the SEC, whose mission is to protect investors and maintain fair financial markets, has done little to extract information about <mark>climate change</mark> from the companies it oversees.</P><P>That has prompted critics to argue that shareholders are not getting a full picture of their holdings—and to question if the agency fully understands the economic threats of global warming.</P><P>The SEC is aware of the information gulf. The commission <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/assets/2016/04/25/document_cw_01.pdf"" target=""_blank"">announced</A> in April that it was considering changing a key rule that governs environmental disclosure, Regulation S-K, saying it knew some investors were unhappy with the “incomplete and inconsistent” landscape of <mark>climate</mark> disclosure.</P><P>“Investors are flying blind and the SEC is not doing their job,” said Jean Rogers, the CEO of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a nonprofit working to establish widespread accounting rules that quantify environmental risks.</P><P>Rogers said many investors aren’t exposed to useful <mark>climate</mark> disclosure in 10-Ks. “The ones who are really doing their due diligence are working very hard to get it other ways,” she said.</P><P>One of those ways—CDP, formerly known as the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project—has been available for years.</P><P>The London-based nonprofit, founded in 2003, surveys the private sector on <mark>climate</mark>, forestry, water and other sustainability topics. Its advisers credit the group with inventing environmental disclosure.</P><P>Paula DiPerna, an adviser at CDP, said the SEC’s move to consider extracting more information on <mark>climate change</mark> comes as <mark>climate</mark> science is “piling up,” and as the firms it oversees are already sharing a wealth of information with other sources.</P><P>Companies that make up 70 percent of publicly traded stocks worldwide are already disclosing <mark>climate</mark> information through CDP, she said.</P><P>“So you have to be an ostrich to still have your head in the sand about <mark>climate change</mark>,” DiPerna added. “And the SEC is waking up to that.”</P><P>Yet a number of business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Petroleum Institute and the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), oppose the SEC’s steps to tighten its <mark>climate</mark> disclosure rules.</P><P>“The disclosures that public companies, public manufacturing companies, must file are already really lengthy and burdensome and overwhelm not only the issuers ... but also their shareholders,” said NAM Director of Tax Policy Christina Crooks.</P><H2>A difficult history</H2><P><mark>Climate</mark> disclosure is a thorny subject at the SEC.</P><P>In 2010, the commission issued voluntary <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2010/33-9106.pdf"" target=""_blank"">guidelines</A> encouraging companies to report serious <mark>climate</mark> risks that could harm their profits. Those perils include international <mark>climate</mark> accords, domestic regulation, physical damages and market trends. The rules passed on a 3-2 party-line vote.</P><P>“We are not opining on whether the world’s <mark>climate</mark> is changing, at what pace it might be changing, or due to what causes,” said Mary Schapiro, an Obama appointee and then-SEC chairwoman, who voted to pass the guidelines.</P><P>Kathleen Casey, a Republican commissioner nominated by President George W. Bush, said the policy was politically motivated and beyond the SEC’s “fundamental mission.”</P><P>Investors convinced that rising seas and extreme weather threatened their returns at first welcomed the 2010 action. The agency was also initially diligent about enforcing the guidelines, writing so-called “comment letters” to companies to get them to explain in greater detail how <mark>climate change</mark> affected their operations.</P><P>Then such reporting petered out, documents show. It eventually stopped under current SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White, whose tenure began April 2013. She’s an independent nominated by President Obama.</P><P>SEC officials wrote 38 comment letters on <mark>climate change</mark> in 2010, followed by 11 in 2011 and three in 2010, according to a 2014 report by Ceres, the <mark>sustainable</mark> finance advocacy group. The SEC wrote zero comment letters in 2013.</P><P>Bevis Longstreth, a Democratic former SEC commissioner who was appointed under President Reagan, blasted that outcome.</P><P>“It has been widely ignored by issuers and the commission alike,” he said of the 2010 document, “reducing what should be mandatory disclosure concerning material effects of <mark>climate change</mark>” to voluntary statements “that fail to usefully inform investors.”</P><H2>Lagging behind international markets</H2><P>Even when the agency was enforcing disclosure, the responses of U.S. companies were often vague compared to those of their international counterparts. Both file SEC documents, but foreign companies generally provide more information.</P><P>Molson Coors Brewing Co., headquartered in Denver, for example, devotes a paragraph to <mark>climate change</mark> in its annual report.</P><P>Its competitor, Diageo PLC, a U.K. company that brews Guinness, provides a rich description of plans to save water and protect its profits. It also talks about the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement and its goals to cut <mark>carbon</mark>, and pinpoints 39 of its locations in water-scarce regions.</P><P>“Water scarcity is particularly important to us because water is our main ingredient,” Diageo said in its latest <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/835403/000119312516676099/d211646d20f.htm"" target=""_blank"">annual report</A>.</P><P>Molson Coors’ entry is more nebulous. It doesn’t provide specific steps to avoid what it says is a risk: “<mark>Climate change</mark> and water availability may negatively affect our business and financial results,” it says in its latest <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/24545/000002454516000054/tap2015123110-k.htm"" target=""_blank"">10-K</A>.</P><P>“If Diageo can do that—and we’re talking about water here in the food and beverage industry—an investor deserves comparable information on how Molson Coors is managing their water risk,” Rogers said.</P><P>A January <A href=""http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/674518.pdf"" target=""_blank"">report</A> by the Government Accountability Office found that implementing financial reforms, specifically the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, took priority over <mark>climate</mark> topics.</P><P>Part of the challenge in getting companies to talk openly at the SEC is that <mark>climate change</mark> data can be subjective. And businesses are often unsure about how <mark>climate</mark> regulations might affect them.</P><P>“Markets have a hard time with qualitative data,” said Jon Lukomnik, executive director of the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute. “They want quantitative data.”</P><P>Nonetheless, Lukomnik said, the SEC is lagging behind other regulators. Stock markets in Brazil and South Africa require firms to publish <mark>climate</mark> data in order to trade on their exchanges, he said.</P><P>“I think you have to look at the SEC in context,” he said, “the context being the rest of the world is moving toward disclosure of environmental factors.”</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>Wire with permission from Environment &amp; Energy Publishing, LLC.

<BODY><MAIN class=""main""><DIV class=""sheet "" id=""sheet-1121663""><DIV class=""wrapper""><DIV class=""split""><P>Across the globe, <mark>IBM</mark>’s researchers are creating solutions to some of the biggest problems our planet and species face today, and machine learning is a huge part of its efforts.</P><P><FIGURE class=""post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter""><FIGCAPTION>Credit: <mark>IBM</mark></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></P><P>To take a deeper dive, we spoke with Lloyd Treinish, an <mark>IBM</mark> researcher with an awesome title: <mark>IBM</mark> Distinguished Engineer, Chief Scientist – Environmental Modeling, <mark>Climate</mark>, Weather and Deep Thunder.</P><P>What does AI bring to the table that wasn’t there five years ago?</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>I think that the biggest contribution that AI has made is in helping people make better decisions, associated with environmental problems, especially when there is uncertainty. However, we must start with the science, otherwise there are no data for AI techniques to use. For example, for weather forecasts, we use our knowledge of the physics of the atmosphere to create mathematical models, which we solve with supercomputers.</P><P>The data may also be used with machine learning (i.e., “AI”) to further the models, so that we can predict the impact of weather, which is what is needed to enable better decisions. We have been doing research on this for over a decade. But in the last few years, it has become practical. In fact, we now have commercial offerings that use this approach.</P><P>Consider, for example, the ability to predict when the power will go out from storm-driven damage a couple of days from now. The storm prediction is a physics problem. Forecasting outages uses AI (machine learning) driven by what the physics tells us and what utilities tell us about outages. The idea is that we can decompose a very hard problem like predicting outages into two simpler ones, and couple them together (i.e., physics + AI).</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>What will <mark>IBM</mark>’s planet-saving AI initiatives look like five years from now?</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Let me rephrase the question, if you don’t mind. They will be environmental initiatives that can help save the planet, not merely AI initiatives. We will use AI and other technologies, driven by solid science from many disciplines. They will help people, businesses and governments make better decisions, to assess uncertainty in different scenarios, and to understand the implications of the tradeoffs of different choices.</P><P>To illustrate what I mean let me outline a couple of examples. Consider a city planner who is keen on mitigating the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> through policy changes. Of particular concern are the impacts from more intense heat waves that can affect the health of citizens, energy usage, etc.</P><P>The planner could ask which approaches should be required such as making all roofs green. But how would one know it they would actually work vs. other choices? What are the tradeoffs, including the costs? Via physics, we can simulate the <mark>climate</mark> over the coming decades at an urban scale as a base.</P><P>We would then redo the simulations with adjustments in the characteristics of the city that reflect different mitigation strategies to see how heat waves would evolve differently. The results of the simulations could be used by an AI-based assistant that can help the city planner do what-if evaluations of such choices and what contribution to more intense heat waves comes from global warming vs. urbanization.</P><P>Consider another example, where a farmer needs to choose between two different types of corn to plant in the upcoming season. They each have different yield characteristics, depending on temperature and rainfall during the growing season, and different value in the market place. There is some variation in the cost to grow, including use of fertilizer, pesticides and irrigation, all of which are dependent on the weather.</P><P>The output of physical models of the atmosphere, agronomic models of crop growth, and economic models of the corn, water and electricity markets covering the pending growing season could be used by an AI-based assistant to help the farmer assess tradeoffs in profit vs. environmental impact (e.g., <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, water usage, effects on soil) to determine a more optimal choice.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>What can my readers do to help <mark>IBM</mark> save the planet?</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>They can become informed about <mark>climate change</mark>, environmental impacts of human activities, and share that knowledge with others.

But to uncover those insights and leverage these techniques, scientists need much more computing power than they typically have access to.  
		 
		World Community Grid addresses that gap. <mark>IBM</mark>'s World Community Grid is a crowd-sourced virtual supercomputer that is powered by the surplus computing power of computers and Androids donated by individual volunteers and organizations.

		Up to five of the most promising environmental and <mark>climate</mark>-related research projects will be supported, with technology and services contributions valued commercially at approximately $200 million. 
		 
		These resources can support many potential areas of inquiry, such as impacts on fresh water resources, predicting migration patterns, and developing models to improve crop resilience. 
		 
		Proposals will be evaluated for scientific merit, potential to contribute to the global community's understanding of specific <mark>climate</mark> and environmental challenges and development of effective strategies to mitigate them, and the capacity of the research team to manage a sustained research project.  
		 
		In return for this support, winning scientists agree to support open science by publicly releasing the research data from their collaboration with us, enabling the global community to benefit from and build upon their findings.  
		 
		Scientists from around the world are encouraged to apply at <A href=""https://<mark>climate</mark>.worldcommunitygrid.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><mark>climate</mark>.worldcommunitygrid.org</A>, with a first round deadline of 15 September. Individuals and organisations can also support this work by joining <A href=""https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">worldcommunitygrid.org</A> to donate their spare computing power to the winning research projects.  
		 
		<mark>Climate change</mark> is a serious threat to people and our planet. And time is of the essence.

•The Project Builds on The UAE’s Commitment Towards Global Prosperity 

HE Dr. Thani Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, UAE Minister of <mark>Climate Change</mark> and Environment, was briefed on the collaboration efforts between <mark>IBM</mark>, Future Society of  Harvard and the Global Manufacturing and Industrialization Summit to use cognitive computing, also widely known as artificial intelligence, to monitor, simulate, predict and suggest policy recommendations related to achieving the UN <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals (SDGs). The briefing was held at the <mark>IBM</mark> Watson Center in New York on the sideline of the UN General Assembly meetings last week. Commenting on this novel approach, Dr. Al Zeyoudi said: &quot;The deployment of cognitive computing to measure progress in achieving the UN SDGs is a truly innovative. By using this technology, all relevant stakeholders will benefit from having a universal and effective platform to monitor, simulate, predict and suggest policy recommendations that would have significant impact on global prosperity.&quot;</P><P>The Seventeen <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals were adopted by world leaders at a historic UN summit in September 2015 with a target set on achieving them by 2030 to eradicate poverty, combat inequality, and address the growing threat of <mark>climate change</mark>. Member countries are responsible for monitoring progress, and driving these goals towards building global prosperity.</P><P>Cognitive computing platforms such as <mark>IBM</mark> Watson can access and analyze a substantial amount of structured and unstructured data that are scattered across multiple databases, as well as social networking sites. This data can be monitored, simulated, and extrapolated to predict impact and support policy makers to make better decisions. <mark>IBM</mark> is currently working on hundreds of applications to expand Watson in areas such as healthcare, law, education, insurance and finance.</P><P> &quot;The United Arab Emirates played a key role in shaping the SDGs, and remains to be one of the very first countries to take concrete steps, locally and internationally, towards its implementation. The United Arab Emirates also set ambitious targets to protect the environment and, from the outset, contributed significantly to limit the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> by jointly collaborating on the development of policies and programs that transform challenges into opportunities for <mark>sustainable</mark> development and prosperity, reinforcing sustainability as a key aspect to UAE’s Vision 2021,&quot; Dr. Al Zeyoudi added.</P><P> “The UAE government is among the first governments to utilize cognitive computing to offer significantly enhanced government services to its citizens and residents” said Dr. Julia Glidden, General Manager <mark>IBM</mark> Global Government Industry. “Cognitive computing will transform public and private sectors and significantly enhance quality decision making for leaders.”, she added.   </P><P> The United Arab Emirates is one of the first countries in the region to have companies invest in cognitive computing. Cognit Technology Solutions was established in 2015 to apply <mark>IBM</mark>’s Watson in the Middle East and North Africa region, bringing cognitive computing solutions to local industries, and supporting a regional ecosystem of entrepreneurs, application developers, and startups that create Watson applications and services across the region.</P><H4>For more information:</H4></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Our discoveries chime with the <A href=""http://wcr.unhabitat.org/main-report/"" rel=""nofollow"">recent findings</A> of the UN Human Settlements Program, which highlights three key trends affecting cities today:</P><UL><LI><H4><STRONG>Urbanization and decentralization</STRONG></H4><P>By 2050, 66% of the world's population will live in urban environments, with most growth happening in small and medium-sized cities. Urbanization and growing decentralization are forcing local authorities to become more self-reliant and increase their capacity to fund local services and institutions, turning cities into incubators that can test new public policy and local government-led initiatives.</P></LI><LI><H4><STRONG><mark>Climate change</mark></STRONG></H4><P>Many cities are in areas vulnerable to <mark>climate change</mark>, such as river deltas, coastlines and drought-prone regions. As cities around the world experience significant shifts from historic weather patterns and an increase in extreme weather events, effective local resiliency strategies to bolster city and regional stability are increasingly important.</P></LI><LI><H4><STRONG>Migration</STRONG></H4><P>Extensive migration across international borders has significant implications for urban communities, presenting both opportunities and challenges for cities receiving influxes of migrants. Large migration flows can rapidly increase the need for services, such as affordable housing, employment opportunities and sanitation. But with the population aging in Europe and other regions, cities also stand to benefit from the increase in migrants who can ease skill shortages and boost economies.</P></LI></UL><H4><STRONG>Social equity</STRONG></H4><P>Inequality has risen to its highest levels in the past three decades, interacting with the other trends in significant ways. Rapid population growth due to urbanization challenges the ability of many cities to provide services for residents in need, such as access to affordable housing, employment, transportation and healthcare. Low-income populations often disproportionately bear the negative impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>, while migrants often are a vulnerable population whose access to social and financial capital has been significantly disrupted.</P><P>These urban trends highlight priority areas for cities and regions to invest in and build capacity to support the needs of their current and future residents. Cities have an essential role to play in tackling these key social equity challenges by delivering vital city services and addressing disparities in social and environmental conditions.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN><ASIDE role=""complementary"" class=""u-bg u-bg--color-lemon""><DIV class=""o-container  u-pad--h u-space--h""><DIV class=""o-content  u-center""><H2>Big data and cognitive computing can help</H2><P>Rapid technological advancements have increased the potential for big data and cognitive technology to empower city leaders to make better decisions and deliver services more effectively, efficiently and equitably. <mark>IBM</mark> cognitive computing and cloud capabilities can help cities tackle the most complex problems they are facing today.</P><H3>The Weather Company® (an <mark>IBM</mark> Business)</H3><P>With the acquisition of The Weather Company and its data from 2.2 billion weather forecast points, <mark>IBM</mark> offers the most accurate, personalized and actionable weather data and insights to millions of people and organizations around the world.

Tech companies are perpetually on the cutting edge of progress, advancing new technologies meant to make the world a better place – but they're not always known for doing it sustainably. However, <STRONG><mark>IBM</mark> and the environment</STRONG> go hand in hand, with the famed corporation leading the way on green tech issues like the environmental friendliness of its source materials.
</P><P>
Recipient of a range of environmental awards including <A href=""http://www.bitc.org.uk/media_centre/press_releases/international_award.html"">the prestigious Coffey International Award</A> for its innovative approach to sustainability issues in business, <mark>IBM</mark> has also earned top honors among electronics manufacturers on the <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>counts.org/scorecard_score.php?co=28""><mark>climate</mark> friendliness scorecard from <mark>Climate</mark> Counts</A>.
</P><P>
Each year, <mark>IBM</mark> releases an annual report that outlines its sustainability goals and actions. The report, upon which much of this article is based, makes it easy for the public to track <mark>IBM</mark>'s progress on issues like electronic waste disposal, chemical management, wildlife protection, and even how much it spends on green initiatives.
</P><P><STRONG><mark>Sustainable</mark> Global Supply Chain</STRONG></P><P>
Starting this year, all of <mark>IBM</mark>'s suppliers <A href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/1616281/<mark>ibm</mark>-challenges-suppliers-to-embrace-sustainabilityor-else?partner="">will be asked to establish environmental goals</A> and measure performance in energy conservation, greenhouse gas emissions and waste management and to publicly disclose the results. In this far-reaching program – the first of its kind among tech companies – <mark>IBM</mark> is using its considerable influence to ensure that chemicals are properly managed and that products are designed with long life in mind.
</P><P>
It's just the latest of a long line of environmental initiatives coming out of <mark>IBM</mark> in recent years, but it has the potential to create a wave of change among a diverse array of suppliers. <mark>IBM</mark> hopes the changes will be complete by 2011, and those that don't comply may lose the company's business.

All of <mark>IBM</mark>'s environmental efforts stem from its comprehensive <A href=""http://www.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/<mark>ibm</mark>/environment/policy/"">Environmental Affairs Policy</A>, which was formalized in its earliest form in 1967. The policy includes a long list of directives including conserving natural resources, using energy responsibly, using development and manufacturing processes that don't cause harm to the environment and creating products that can be reused, recycled or disposed of safely.
</P><P>
<mark>IBM</mark> also set out to create products that actually help solve environmental problems around the world, notably in its collaboration with Tokyo's Kogyo Co., Ltd. <A href=""http://cleantech.com/news/2978/<mark>ibm</mark>-tokyo-ohka-kogyo-to-work-on-thin-film-solar"">in the development of solar power products</A>. Seeking to develop cheaper, more efficient and thinner solar cells, <mark>IBM</mark> hopes to bring forth the next generation of this clean energy technology so it's more accessible to all.
</P><P><STRONG><mark>Climate</mark> Protection, <mark>Pollution</mark> Prevention &amp; Resource Conservation</STRONG></P><P><A href=""http://www.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/<mark>ibm</mark>/environment/<mark>climate</mark>/index.shtml""><mark>IBM</mark> says <mark>climate change</mark> is a serious concern</A> that requires a joint effort between the public and private sectors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. <mark>IBM</mark> has chosen to concentrate many of its <mark>climate change</mark> efforts in energy conservation, since the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions released by energy companies that power <mark>IBM</mark>'s facilities represent the tech giant's biggest impact on the <mark>climate</mark>.
</P><P>
Since 1990, <mark>IBM</mark> has saved 4.9 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity consumption, avoided almost 3.3 million metric tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions and saved over $343 million <A href=""http://www.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/<mark>ibm</mark>/environment/<mark>climate</mark>/energy.shtml"">through energy conservation</A>. <mark>IBM</mark> also began procuring renewable energy in 2008, and has <A href=""http://www.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/<mark>ibm</mark>/environment/<mark>climate</mark>/pfc.shtml"">exceeded its goal</A> of reducing perfluorocompounds (PFCs) from semiconductor manufacturing operations over 1995 levels.
</P><P>
Hazardous waste represents a huge challenge to the tech industry, but <mark>IBM</mark> has been seeking to <A href=""http://www.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/<mark>ibm</mark>/environment/<mark>pollution</mark>/"">eliminate or reduce use and disposal of toxic substances</A> since 1971. Product redesigns and careful oversight of hazardous waste disposal and recycling has helped <mark>IBM</mark> reduce its output by 10.9 percent in 2008.
</P><P>
In 2000, <mark>IBM</mark> <A href=""http://www.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/<mark>ibm</mark>/environment/conservation/"">identified the source of its greatest water consumption</A>, in its microelectronics manufacturing operations, and established a water savings goal of 2 percent of total annual water usage within these operations. Within 5 years, <mark>IBM</mark> exceeded that goal, reaching 4.6 percent, and that figure was up to 5.5 percent by 2008.
</P><P>
<mark>IBM</mark> also has a wide range of waste management, recycling and material conservation programs. When products reach the end of their usage, <A href=""http://www.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/<mark>ibm</mark>/environment/conservation/""><mark>IBM</mark> takes responsibility</A>. In 2008, the company processed 42,302 metric tons of end-of-life product and product waste, reusing or recycling 96.9 percent and sending only 0.6 percent to landfills or incineration facilities.

Today, however, concerns over <mark>climate change</mark> are taking this to a whole new level, and companies will have to adapt to growing regulatory, environmental, and consumer pressures.</P><P>
This is a daunting prospect. That may explain why, in a survey of S&amp;P Global 100 companies by the Center for <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy Solutions, only 28 percent said they had done <mark>climate</mark> assessments, and an even smaller number (18 percent) said they use <mark>climate</mark>-specific tools or models to assess their risks.<A onclick=""return false;"" href=""#"" rel=""#footnote1"" class=""link-footnote""><SUP>1</SUP></A><SPAN style=""display: none;"" class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote1""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">1.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text""><EM>Weathering the Storm: Building Business Resilience to <mark>Climate Change</mark></EM>, Center for <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy Solutions, 2013, c2es.org.
</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN> But delay is not a strategy. Organizations can benefit by taking action to recognize and even anticipate such <mark>climate</mark>-related risks as changing government policies, product-preference shifts, and price volatility.<A onclick=""return false;"" href=""#"" rel=""#footnote2"" class=""link-footnote""><SUP>2</SUP></A><SPAN style=""display: none;"" class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote2""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">2.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text"">“<A href=""/insights/energy_resources_materials/the_business_of_sustainability_mckinsey_global_survey_results"">The business of sustainability: McKinsey Global Survey results</A>,” October 2011.

There are, in broad terms, six different kinds of <mark>climate</mark> risks (Exhibit 1). These can be divided into two interconnected groups: value-chain risks and external-stakeholder risks.</P><FIGURE id=""exhibit-main_0_ctl13_h4Headline"" class=""text-s exhibit "" data-module=""Exhibit"" aria-labelledby=""main_0_ctl13_h4Headline"" aria-describedby=""main_0_ctl13_divDescription""><FIGCAPTION class=""metadata""><DIV class=""eyebrow"">Exhibit 1</DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H2>Value-chain risks</H2><P><EM>Physical risks</EM> are those related to damage inflicted on infrastructure and other assets, such as factories and supply-chain operations, by the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as wildfires, floods, or hurricanes. According to the <EM>New England Journal of Medicine</EM>, the frequency and severity of <mark>climate</mark>-related disasters like floods, droughts, and storm surges has increased markedly since the 1970s.</P><P>
This can affect company performance in real and visible ways. In 2012, for example, Cargill, one of the world’s largest food and agricultural companies, posted its worst quarterly earnings in two decades, in large part because of the US drought. While no single event can be attributed to <mark>climate change</mark>, of course, this is an example of how <mark>climate</mark> can and does affect business prospects. Western Digital Technologies, a major supplier of hard disk drives, posted a sharp decline in revenues in 2011 after flooding in Thailand, where most of its production was located. That loss of production meant global supply slumped, with severe reverberations for computer manufacturers.</P><P>
Such physical risks are impossible to control, but companies can take steps to prepare for the changes that could occur in years and decades to come. First, it helps to forecast a range of reasonable scenarios; doing so may require the help of specialized <mark>climate</mark> modelers. <mark>Climate</mark> forecasting can highlight high-level risk probabilities by region, such as for flood, drought, or sea-level rise, and for long-term changes in such factors as temperature, humidity, or rainfall patterns. The scenarios should help reveal which parts of the business are vulnerable. A variety of mitigating risk processes, technical standards, and capabilities can then be put in place. In the long term, risk management could call for changes to supply chains (to build in geographic variability or redundancy), including moving away from suppliers and/or locations that are highly exposed.</P><P><EM>Price risks</EM> refer to the increased price volatility of raw materials and other commodities. Drought can raise the price of water; <mark>climate</mark>-related regulation can drive up the cost of energy. High-tech and renewable-energy industries, for example, face price risks in the competition for rare earths, which are used in the production of computer hard drives, televisions, wind turbines, solar photovoltaic systems, and electric vehicles.</P><P>
For more than a decade, the prices of many resources have been both rising and volatile.<A onclick=""return false;"" href=""#"" rel=""#footnote3"" class=""link-footnote""><SUP>3</SUP></A><SPAN style=""display: none;"" class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote3""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">3.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text"">

Some companies are taking significant steps to get ahead of this concern. IKEA is in the process of substituting renewables for conventional sources of energy; in time, it hopes to be largely self-sufficient with regard to power. In that event, the retailer will have a good idea of what price it will pay for power and will insulate itself against global and regional energy price spikes.<A onclick=""return false;"" href=""#"" rel=""#footnote4"" class=""link-footnote""><SUP>4</SUP></A><SPAN style=""display: none;"" class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote4""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">4.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text"">“Ikea unveils plans to use 100% clean energy by 2020,”<EM>Guardian</EM>, October 23, 2012, theguardian.com.
</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN> Volkswagen is doing something similar. To hedge against the possibility of rising fossil-fuel prices, the German car maker is investing €1 billion in renewable-energy projects and is aiming to power its manufacturing sites mainly through on-site production.<A onclick=""return false;"" href=""#"" rel=""#footnote5"" class=""link-footnote""><SUP>5</SUP></A><SPAN style=""display: none;"" class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote5""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">5.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text"">“VW will unabhängig von Stromversorgern warden,”<EM>Handelsblatt</EM>, October 12, 2012, handlesblatt.com.

Antonio Volpin, “How businesses can address the risks related to energy consumption,”<EM>Energy World</EM>, January 2014, energyinst.org.
</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><EM>Product risks</EM> refer to core products becoming unpopular or even unsellable. Effects could range from losing a little market share to going under entirely. Alternative cooling technologies, for example, could conceivably displace air-conditioning systems; ski resorts that no longer can count on snow or cold weather could go under. Regulatory and production costs could raise the price of coal in some markets above that of lower-<mark>carbon</mark> competition, with ripple effects for mining-equipment manufacturers and related industries.</P><P>
This kind of risk, of course, is familiar; new products, by definition, displace older ones. The difference is that responding to <mark>climate</mark>-related pressures can change the entire context in which a business operates, not just a specific segment. It’s more like the change from the horse-and-buggy era to the car than shifting from manual to automatic transmission. Utilities, for one, know this; they are seeing their traditional business model threatened in markets where renewable energy accounts for a greater part of new generation.</P><P>
On the positive side, however, greener products are emerging in a number of industries. The construction and infrastructure sectors are developing new products and services that cater to cleaner cities, such as electric-vehicle charging infrastructure, renewables integration, smart metering, smart grids, congestion-fee  systems, and high-performance building technologies.</P><P>
In the business-to-consumer sectors, especially retail and consumer products, new segments are making inroads as people make it clear they are willing to pay for greener products. Groceries advertised as <mark>sustainable</mark>, for example, are growing fast in the United States, and the organic-food sector has seen double-digit growth for the past decade. This is a testament to the emergence of a significant cohort of customers for whom environmental consciousness is a factor in where and what they buy.</P><P>
How can companies adapt? One approach is to adopt a “design to sustainability” approach, in which new products are designed to minimize waste and to be broken down for reuse or recycling. Another is to redefine corporate strategy to align business interests with <mark>climate</mark>-change mitigation and adaptation. Siemens, for instance, has developed a dedicated “environmental portfolio” of <mark>carbon</mark>-efficient products, while Saint-Gobain, the construction and packaging giant, puts <mark>sustainable</mark> housing technologies at the core of its product-development strategy.</P><H2>External-stakeholder risks</H2><P>We define <EM>ratings risk</EM> as the possibility of higher costs of capital because of <mark>climate</mark>-related exposure such as <mark>carbon</mark> pricing, supply-chain disruption, or product obsolescence.</P><P>
While the ratings risk varies widely between and within industries, even companies with <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive activities can start to manage it. Already, more than 4,000 organizations are reporting their exposure to the CDP (previously known as the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project), a first step in dealing with the issue. A number of oil majors use an internal <mark>carbon</mark> price to guide some of their strategic decisions.</P><ASIDE class="" text-l -span-right disruptor ""><DIV class=""disruptor-content""><SPAN id=""main_0_ctl15_sectionHeadline"" class=""title headline"">Would you like to learn more about our <A href=""/business-functions/sustainability-and-resource-productivity/how-we-help-clients"">Sustainability &amp; Resource Productivity Practice</A>?</SPAN></DIV></ASIDE><P><EM>Regulation risk</EM> refers to government action prompted by <mark>climate change</mark>. This can take many forms, including rules that add costs or impede specific business activities, subsidies in support of a competitor, or withdrawal of subsidies. In many industries, government plays a crucial role in setting the rules of the game; with <mark>climate change</mark> in mind, many of those rules are changing.</P><P>
Around the world, we are seeing governments respond to the possibility of <mark>climate change</mark> in ways that necessarily affect business prospects. To cite just a few examples: China is launching <mark>carbon</mark>-trading programs in seven regions in preparation for a potential national plan by 2020. Most US states have introduced renewable portfolio standards, which require a certain proportion of the state’s electricity to be produced from renewable sources. Ethiopia has charted a course to become a middle-income country through low-emissions growth with its <mark>Climate</mark>-Resilient Green Economy strategy.</P><P>
One complication is that on the national and international level, <mark>climate</mark>-change policies often change, sometimes with the speed of an election result. That makes it difficult for businesses to make long-term investment and operating decisions. Businesses can, however, take the initiative in managing regulation risk. The first step in preparing for and helping to shape future regulation is to understand the policy options. The second step is to develop an internal strategy on <mark>climate change</mark> to put the company in a position to react effectively to regulations and policy changes. The final step is to work with external stakeholders, such as regulators and industry groups, to get their perspectives.</P><P><EM>Reputation risk</EM> can be either direct, stemming from a company-specific action or policy, or indirect, in the form of public perception of the overall industry. In the <mark>climate</mark>-change context, reputation risk can be understood as the probability of profitability loss following a business’s activities or positions that the public considers harmful. A poor reputation on <mark>climate</mark> can hurt sales through consumer boycotts or local community protests. It could damage the regulatory environment and investor relationships. And it could make the company less attractive to current or future employees.</P><P>
This is part of a larger trend: the changing expectations of stakeholders. Investors are asking for disclosure of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and starting to lodge concerns about “stranded” assets—those that become unusable due to <mark>climate</mark>-policy regulation or physical <mark>climate change</mark>. Many employees want sustainability to be part of the day-to-day operations of their companies. Nongovernmental organizations are getting more prominence when it comes to their ability to measure and compare corporate actions.</P><P>
In response, some companies have taken very public steps to adopt <mark>climate</mark>-change strategies. Unilever, for example, leads the FTSE CDP <mark>Carbon</mark> Strategy risk and performance index and has improved its <mark>carbon</mark> efficiency by 40 percent since 1995. Its stated goal is to reduce the <mark>carbon</mark> and water footprints of its products to half of 2010 levels by 2020. The retailer Kohl’s has been recognized for its efforts to green its operations and reduce emissions.<A onclick=""return false;"" href=""#"" rel=""#footnote7"" class=""link-footnote""><SUP>7</SUP></A><SPAN style=""display: none;"" class=""tooltip"" id=""footnote7""><SPAN class=""footnote-content""><SPAN class=""footnote-number"">7.</SPAN><SPAN class=""footnote-text""><EM>Partner Profile</EM>, United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2015, epa.gov.

</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN> Just about every company in the Fortune 500 touts its commitment to sustainability. There is still a long way to go in many respects, but it can be said that action has well and truly started.</P><H2>The big picture</H2><P>Based on case studies, industry interviews, and our analysis, Exhibit 2 evaluates the <mark>climate</mark>-change risk exposure of seven different industries.</P><FIGURE id=""exhibit-main_0_ctl16_h4Headline"" class=""text-s exhibit "" data-module=""Exhibit"" aria-labelledby=""main_0_ctl16_h4Headline"" aria-describedby=""main_0_ctl16_divDescription""><FIGCAPTION class=""metadata""><DIV class=""eyebrow"">Exhibit 2</DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>
Results for individual companies will vary, of course, depending on geography, target markets, and management. But this chart is a useful way to look at the economic landscape.</P><P>
One truth is evident across all these industries: companies that ignore <mark>climate</mark>-related risks are likely to feel the consequences. Those that identify the most pertinent risks, think through how they relate to one another, and then put in place appropriate measures can begin to manage the challenges ahead. These companies will not only put themselves in position to ride out the storm; they could rise above it.</P><FOOTER id=""main_0_divAboutAuthors"" role=""contentinfo"" class=""about-authors text-s""><H4 class=""headline"">About the author(s)</H4><STRONG>Hauke Engel</STRONG> is a consultant in McKinsey’s Frankfurt office, <STRONG>Per-Anders Enkvist</STRONG> is a principal in the Stockholm office, and <STRONG>Kimberly Henderson</STRONG> is a consultant in the London office.The authors wish to thank Blandine Antoine and Julien Cochard for their contributions to this article.

As CEO in what were arguably <mark>IBM</mark>’s darkest hours, Gerstner brought the company back from the brink. After nearly ten wrenching years, in which the big-machine manufacturer remade itself into a comprehensive software, hardware, and services provider, business was looking good. So the challenge for Sam Palmisano, when he took over as CEO in 2002, was to come up with a mandate for a second act in the company’s transformation.</P><P>His primary aim was to get different parts of the company working together so <mark>IBM</mark> could offer customers “integrated solutions”—hardware, software, services, and financing—at a single price. As part of this effort, he asked all of <mark>IBM</mark>’s 320,000 employees, in 170 countries, to weigh in on a new set of shared corporate values.</P><P>Over a 72-hour period, thousands of <mark>IBM</mark>ers throughout the world gave Palmisano and his executive team an earful in an intranet discussion dubbed “ValuesJam,” an often-heated debate about the company’s heart and soul. Twenty-four hours into the exercise, at least one senior exec wanted to pull the plug. The jam had clearly struck a chord with employees, but it was a dissonant one, full of rancor and discontent.</P><P>Palmisano let the discussion continue, and the next day, the mood began to shift. The criticism became more constructive. Out of the million words generated by the jam grew a set of values that, as Palmisano explains in this interview, are meant to guide the operational decisions made by <mark>IBM</mark>’s employees—and, more important, to serve as Palmisano’s mandate to continue the reinvention of the company.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article article-first-row premium""><DIV class=""interview-intro""><P>In July 2003, International Business Machines Corporation conducted a 72-hour experiment whose outcome was as uncertain as anything going on in its research labs. Six months into a top-to-bottom review of its management organization, <mark>IBM</mark> held a three-day discussion via the corporate intranet about the company’s values. The forum, dubbed ValuesJam, joined thousands of employees in a debate about the very nature of the computer giant and what it stood for.</P><P>Over the three days, an estimated 50,000 of <mark>IBM</mark>’s employees—including CEO Sam Palmisano—checked out the discussion, posting nearly 10,000 comments about the proposed values. The jam had clearly struck a chord.</P><P>But it was a disturbingly dissonant one. Some comments were merely cynical. One had the subject line: “The only value in <mark>IBM</mark> today is the stock price.” Another read, “Company values (ya right).” Others, though, addressed fundamental management issues. “I feel we talk a lot about trust and taking risks. But at the same time, we have endless audits, mistakes are punished and not seen as a welcome part of learning, and managers (and others) are consistently checked,” wrote one employee. “There appears to be a great reluctance among our junior executive community to challenge the views of our senior execs,” said another. “Many times I have heard expressions like, ‘Would you tell Sam that his strategy is wrong!!?’” Twenty-four hours into the exercise, at least one senior executive wanted to pull the plug.</P><P>But Palmisano wouldn’t hear of it. And then the mood began to shift. After a day marked by critics letting off steam, the countercritics began to weigh in. While acknowledging the company’s shortcomings, they argued that much of <mark>IBM</mark>’s culture and values was worth preserving. “Shortly after joining <mark>IBM</mark> 18 years ago,” wrote one, “I was asked to serve on a jury. When I approached the bench and answered [the lawyers’] questions, I was surprised when the judge said, ‘You guys can pick whoever else you want, but <EM>I want this <mark>IBM</mark>er</EM> on that jury.’ I have never felt so much pride. His statement said it all: integrity, excellence, and quality.” Comments like these became more frequent, criticism became more constructive, and the ValuesJam conversation stabilized.</P><P>The question of what was worth preserving and what needed to be changed was at the heart of ValuesJam. In 1914—when the company was making tabulating machines, scales for weighing meat, and cheese slicers—president Thomas Watson, Sr., decreed three corporate principles, called the Basic Beliefs: “respect for the individual,” “the best customer service,” and “the pursuit of excellence.” They would inform <mark>IBM</mark>’s culture, and help drive its success, for more than half a century.</P><P>By 2002, when Palmisano took over as CEO, much had happened to Big Blue. In the early 1990s, the company had suffered the worst reversal in its history and then, under Lou Gerstner, had fought its way back, transformed from a mainframe maker into a robust provider of integrated hardware, networking, and software solutions. Palmisano felt that the Basic Beliefs could still serve the company—but now as the foundation for a new set of corporate values that could energize employees even more than its near-death experience had. Looking for a modern-day equivalent, Palmisano first queried 300 of his senior executives, then quickly opened up the discussion, through a survey of over a thousand employees, to get a sense of how people at all levels, functions, and locations would articulate <mark>IBM</mark>’s values and their aspirations for the company. Out of this research grew the propositions that were debated in ValuesJam.</P><P>After—and even during—the jam, company analysts pored over the postings, mining the million-word text for key themes. Finally, a small team that included Palmisano came up with a revised set of corporate values. The CEO announced the new values to employees in an intranet broadcast in November 2003: “dedication to every client’s success,” “<mark>innovation</mark> that matters—for our company and for the world,” “trust and personal responsibility in all relationships.” Earthshaking? No, but imbued with legitimacy and packed with meaning and implications for <mark>IBM</mark>.</P><P>To prove that the new values were more than window dressing, Palmisano immediately made some changes. He called on the director of a major business unit—e-business hosting services for the U.S. industrial sector—and charged her with identifying gaps between the values and company practices. He bluntly told his 15 direct reports that they had better follow suit. Another online jam was held in October 2004 (this one informally dubbed a “logjam”) in which employees were asked to identify organizational barriers to <mark>innovation</mark> and revenue growth.</P><P>Although Palmisano, by his own account, is building on a strategy laid down by Gerstner, the leadership styles of the two men are very different. Under Gerstner, there was little expansive talk about <mark>IBM</mark>’s heritage. He was an outsider, a former CEO of RJR Nabisco and an ex-McKinsey consultant, who was faced with the daunting task of righting a sinking ship. In fact, he famously observed, shortly after taking over, that “the last thing <mark>IBM</mark> needs right now is a vision.” Palmisano, by contrast, is a true-blue <mark>IBM</mark>er, who started at the company in 1973 as a salesman in Baltimore. Like many of his generation who felt such acute shame when <mark>IBM</mark> was brought to its knees in the early 1990s, he clearly has a visceral attachment to the firm—and to the hope that it may someday regain its former greatness. At the same time, the erstwhile salesman is, in the words of a colleague, “a results-driven, make-it-rain, close-the-deal sort of guy”: not the first person you’d expect to hold forth on a subjective topic like “trust.”</P><P>In this edited conversation with HBR senior editor Paul Hemp and HBR’s editor, Thomas A. Stewart, Palmisano talks about the strategic importance of values to <mark>IBM</mark>. He begins by explaining why—and how—hard financial metrics and soft corporate values can coexist.</P></DIV><P>Corporate values generally are feel-good statements that have almost no effect on a company’s operations. What made—what makes—you think they can be more than this?</P><P>Look at the portrait of Tom Watson, Sr., in our lobby. You’ve never seen such a stern man. The eyes in the painting stare right through you. This was <EM>not</EM> a soft individual. He was a capitalist. He wanted <mark>IBM</mark> to make money, lots of it. But he was perceptive enough to build the company in a way that would ensure its prosperity long after he left the scene. His three Basic Beliefs successfully steered this company through persistent change and repeated reinvention for more than 50 years.</P><P>An organic system, which is what a company is, needs to adapt. And we think values—that’s what we call them today at <mark>IBM</mark>, but you can call them “beliefs” or “principles” or “precepts” or even “DNA”—are what enable you to do that. They let you change everything, from your products to your strategies to your business model, but remain true to your essence, your basic mission and identity.</P><P>Unfortunately, over the decades, Watson’s Basic Beliefs became distorted and took on a life of their own. “Respect for the individual” became entitlement: not fair work for all, not a chance to speak out, but a guaranteed job and culture-dictated promotions. “The pursuit of excellence” became arrogance: We stopped listening to our markets, to our customers, to each other. We were so successful for so long that we could never see another point of view. And when the market shifted, we almost went out of business. We had to cut a workforce of more than 400,000 people in half. Over the course of several years, we wiped out the equivalent of a medium-sized northeastern city—say, Providence, Rhode Island.</P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P>We were so successful for so long that we could never see another point of view. And when the market shifted, we almost went out of business.</P></DIV></DIV><P>If you lived through this, as I did, it was easy to see how the company’s values had become part of the problem. But I believe values can once again help guide us through major change and meet some of the formidable challenges we face.</P><P>For instance, I feel that a strong value system is crucial to bringing together and motivating a workforce as large and diverse as ours has become. We have nearly one-third of a million employees serving clients in 170 countries. Forty percent of those people don’t report daily to an <mark>IBM</mark> site; they work on the client’s premises, from home, or they’re mobile. And, perhaps most significant, given <mark>IBM</mark>’s tradition of hiring and training young people for a lifetime of work, half of today’s employees have been with the company for fewer than five years because of recent acquisitions and our relatively new practice of hiring seasoned professionals. In a modest hiring year, we now add 20,000 to 25,000 people.</P><P>In effect, gradually repopulating Providence, Rhode Island!</P><P>Exactly. So how do you channel this diverse and constantly changing array of talent and experience into a common purpose? How do you get people to <EM>passionately</EM> pursue that purpose?</P><P>You could employ all kinds of traditional, top-down management processes. But they wouldn’t work at <mark>IBM</mark>—or, I would argue, at an increasing number of twenty-first-century companies. You just can’t impose command-and-control mechanisms on a large, highly professional workforce. I’m not only talking about our scientists, engineers, and consultants. More than 200,000 of our employees have college degrees. The CEO can’t say to them, “Get in line and follow me.” Or “<EM>I’ve</EM> decided what <EM>your</EM> values are.” They’re too smart for that. And as you know, smarter people tend to be, well, a little more challenging; you might even say cynical.</P><P>But even if our people did accept this kind of traditional, hierarchical management system, our clients wouldn’t. As we learned at <mark>IBM</mark> over the years, a top-down system can create a smothering bureaucracy that doesn’t allow for the speed, the flexibility, the <mark>innovation</mark> that clients expect today.</P><P>So you’re saying that values are about how employees behave when management isn’t there, which it can’t be— which it shouldn’t be—given <mark>IBM</mark>’s size and the need for people to make decisions quickly. You’re basically talking about using values to manage.</P><P>Yes. A values-based management system. Let me cast the issue in a slightly different light. When you think about it, there’s no optimal way to organize <mark>IBM</mark>. We traditionally were viewed as a large, successful, “well-managed” company. That was a compliment. But in today’s fast-changing environment, it’s a problem. You can easily end up with a bureaucracy of people overanalyzing problems and slowing down the decision-making process.</P><P>Think of our organizational matrix. Remember, we operate in 170 countries. To keep it simple, let’s say we have 60 or 70 major product lines. We have more than a dozen customer segments. Well, if you mapped out the entire 3-d matrix, you’d get more than 100,000 cells—cells in which you have to close out P&amp;Ls every day, make decisions, allocate resources, make trade-offs. You’ll drive people crazy trying to centrally manage every one of those intersections.</P><P>So if there’s no way to optimize <mark>IBM</mark> through organizational structure or by management dictate, you have to empower people while ensuring that they’re making the right calls the right way. And by “right,” I’m not talking about ethics and legal compliance alone; those are table stakes. I’m talking about decisions that support and give life to <mark>IBM</mark>’s strategy and brand, decisions that shape a culture. That’s why values, for us, aren’t soft. They’re the basis of what we do, our mission as a company. They’re a touchstone for decentralized decision making. It used to be a rule of thumb that “people don’t do what you expect; they do what you inspect.” My point is that it’s just not possible to inspect everyone anymore. But you also can’t just let go of the reins and let people do what they want without guidance or context. You’ve got to create a management system that empowers people and provides a basis for decision making that is consistent with who we are at <mark>IBM</mark>.</P><P>How do the new values help further <mark>IBM</mark>’s strategy?</P><P>In two main ways. Back some 12 years ago, three-fifths of our business was in computer hardware and roughly two-fifths was in software and services. Today, those numbers are more than reversed. Well, if three-fifths of your business is manufacturing, management is basically supervisory: “You do this. You do that.” But that no longer works when your business is primarily based on knowledge. And your business model also changes dramatically.</P><P>For one thing, people—rather than products—become your brand. Just as our products have had to be consistent with the <mark>IBM</mark> brand promise, now more than ever, so do our people. One way to ensure that is to inform their behavior with a globally consistent set of values.</P><P>Second, the IT industry has continued to shift toward reintegration. We all know the story of how the industry fragmented in the 1980s and 1990s, with separate companies selling the processors, the storage devices, and the software that make up a computer system—almost killing <mark>IBM</mark>, the original vertically integrated computer company. Now customers are demanding a package of computer products and services from a single company, a company that can offer them an integrated solution to their business problems. This is a big opportunity for <mark>IBM</mark>. We probably have a wider array of computer products and services and know-how than anyone. But it’s also a challenge. How can we get our people in far-flung business units with different financial targets and incentives working together in teams that can offer at a single price a comprehensive and customized solution—one that doesn’t show the organizational seams?</P><P>Companies usually face the issue of workforce integration after a huge merger. We needed to integrate our existing workforce as a strategic response to the reintegration of the industry. It won’t surprise you that I didn’t think the answer lay in a new organizational structure or in more management oversight. What you need to foster this sort of cooperation is a common set of guidelines about how we make decisions, day in and day out. In other words, values.</P><P>And what happens when the strategy changes?</P><P>Ah, that’s why the right set of values is so important. There’s always going to be another strategy on the horizon as the market changes, as technologies come and go. So we wanted values that would foster an organization able to quickly execute a new strategy. At the same time, we wanted values that, like Watson’s Basic Beliefs, would be enduring, that would guide the company through economic cycles and geopolitical shifts, that would transcend changes in products, technologies, employees, and leaders.</P><P>How did <mark>IBM</mark> distill new values from its past traditions and current employee feedback?</P><P>The last time <mark>IBM</mark> examined its values was nearly a century ago. Watson was an entrepreneur, leading what was, in today’s lingo, a start-up. So in 1914, he simply said, “Here are our beliefs. Learn them. Live them.” That was appropriate for his day, and there’s no question it worked. But 90 years later, we couldn’t have someone in headquarters sitting up in bed in the middle of the night and saying, “Here are our new values!” We couldn’t be casual about tinkering with the DNA of a company like <mark>IBM</mark>. We had to come up with a way to get the employees to create the value system, to determine the company’s principles. Watson’s Basic Beliefs, however distorted they might have become over the years, had to be the starting point.</P><P>After getting input from <mark>IBM</mark>’s top 300 executives and conducting focus groups with more than a thousand employees—a statistically representative cross-section—we came up with three perfectly sound values. [For a detailed description of how <mark>IBM</mark> got from the Basic Beliefs to its new set of values, see the sidebar “Continuity and Change.”] But I knew we’d eventually throw out the statements to everyone in the company to debate. That’s where ValuesJam came in—this live, companywide conversation on our intranet.</P><ARTICLE-SIDEBAR class=""article-sidebar sidebar--half"" data-sidebar-alternate=""sidebar""><H4 class=""sidebar-title"">Continuity and Change </H4><DIV class=""sidebar-contents height--collapse""><P><mark>IBM</mark>’s new values grew out of a long tradition. In 1914, Thomas Watson, Sr., the founder of the modern International Business Machines Corporation, laid out three principles known as the <EM>Basic Beliefs</EM>: </P><UL><LI>Respect for the individual </LI></UL><UL><LI>The best customer service </LI></UL><UL><LI>The pursuit of excellence </LI></UL><P>Although these beliefs played a significant role in driving <mark>IBM</mark>’s success over most of the twentieth century, they eventually were subsumed—and, in effect, redefined—by a sense of entitlement and arrogance within the organization. That, according to CEO Sam Palmisano, contributed to the company’s failure to respond to market changes in the early 1990s and to its near demise. </P><P>In February 2003, just under a year after taking over as CEO, at a meeting of <mark>IBM</mark>’s top 300 managers, Palmisano raised the idea of reinventing the company’s values as a way to manage and reintegrate the sprawling and diverse enterprise. He put forth <EM>four concepts</EM>, three of them drawn from Watson’s Basic Beliefs, as possible bases for the new values: </P><UL><LI>Respect </LI></UL><UL><LI>Excellence </LI></UL><UL><LI><mark>Innovation</mark> </LI></UL><P>These were “test marketed” through surveys and focus groups with more than 1,000 <mark>IBM</mark> employees. The notion of “respect” was thrown out because of its connotations of the past. It was also decided that statements rather than just words would be more compelling. </P><P>Out of this process grew the three <EM>proposed values</EM> discussed during the July 2003 online forum, ValuesJam: </P><UL><LI>Commitment to the customer </LI></UL><UL><LI>Excellence through <mark>innovation</mark> </LI></UL><UL><LI>Integrity that earns trust </LI></UL><P>Using a specially tailored “jamalyzer” tool—based on <mark>IBM</mark>’s e-classifier software, but turbocharged with additional capabilities designed to process constantly changing content—<mark>IBM</mark> analysts crunched the million-plus words posted during the ValuesJam. Some themes emerged. For example, many people said that a silo mentality pitted the business units against one another, to the detriment of <mark>IBM</mark> as a whole. Several people characterized this as a trust issue. But the proposed value “integrity that earns trust” was criticized as being too vague. Some thought it was just another way of saying “respect for the individual,” one of the original Basic Beliefs that many now viewed as outdated. And the notion of trust was seen as being too inwardly focused—management trusting its employees—and not prescriptive enough in terms of how employees should behave with each other or with parties outside the company. </P><P>Drawing on this analysis, the results of pre- and post-jam surveys, and a full reading of the raw transcripts, a small team, with input from Palmisano, arrived at a revised set of new corporate values: </P><UL><LI><STRONG>Dedication to every client’s success</STRONG></LI></UL><UL><LI><STRONG><mark>Innovation</mark> that matters—for our company and for the world</STRONG></LI></UL><UL><LI><STRONG>Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships</STRONG></LI></UL><P>These were published on the company intranet in November 2003.</P></DIV></ARTICLE-SIDEBAR><P>What was your own experience during the jam?

[For a selection of Palmisano’s postings during the ValuesJam, see the sidebar “Sam Joins the Fray.”] And yes, the electronic argument was hot and contentious and messy. But you had to get comfortable with that. Understand, we had done three or four big online jams before this, so we had some idea of how lively they can be.

In fact, the whole place was in flames. There was even talk of breaking up the company. And he responded brilliantly. Here’s this outsider who managed to marshal the collective urgency of tens of thousands of people like me to save this company and turn it around: without a doubt one of the greatest saves in business history. But the trick then wasn’t creating a sense of urgency—we had that. Maybe you needed to shake people out of being shell-shocked. But most <mark>IBM</mark>ers were willing to do whatever it took to save the company, not to mention their own jobs. And there was a lot of pride at stake. Lou’s task was mostly to convince people that he was making the right changes.</P><P>Once things got better, though, there was another kind of danger: that we would slip back into complacency. As our financial results improved dramatically and we began outperforming our competitors, people—already weary from nearly a decade of change—would say, “Well, why do I have to do things differently now? The leadership may be different, but the strategy is fundamentally sound. Why do I have to change?” This is, by the way, a problem that everyone running a successful company wrestles with.</P><P>So the challenge shifted. Instead of galvanizing people through fear of failure, you have to galvanize them through hope and aspiration. You lay out the opportunity to become a great company again—the greatest in the world, which is what <mark>IBM</mark> used to be. And you hope people feel the same need, the urgency you do, to get there. Well, I think <mark>IBM</mark>ers today do feel that urgency. Maybe the jam’s greatest contribution was to make that fact unambiguously clear to all of us, very visibly, in public. 
 </P><P>What were the chief points of debate—or contention?</P><P>There was actually remarkable agreement on <EM>what</EM> we all value. The debate, as it turned out, wasn’t over the values themselves so much. The debate was about whether <mark>IBM</mark> today is willing and able to live them.</P><P>For instance, people seemed to understand the need to reintegrate the company, but there were complaints—legitimate complaints—about things that are getting in the way. People would describe extremely frustrating situations. They’d say something like: “I’m in Tokyo, prototyping software for a client, and I need a software engineer based in Austin <EM>right now</EM> to help in a blade server configuration. But I can’t just say, ‘Please come to Tokyo and help.’ I need to get a charge code first so I can pay his department for his time!”</P><P>There’s a collective impatience that we’ve been tapping into to drive the change needed to make <mark>IBM</mark> everything that all of us aspire for it to be. I’m convinced that we wouldn’t have gotten to this point if we hadn’t found a way to engage the entire <mark>IBM</mark> population in a genuine, candid conversation.</P><P>By the way, having a global, universally accessible intranet like ours certainly helps, but the technology isn’t the point. I think we would’ve found a way to have this companywide dialogue if the Web didn’t exist. [For an explanation of how the jam worked, see the sidebar “Managing ValuesJam.”]</P><ARTICLE-SIDEBAR class=""article-sidebar sidebar--half"" data-sidebar-alternate=""sidebar""><H4 class=""sidebar-title"">Managing ValuesJam </H4><DIV class=""sidebar-contents height--collapse""><P><mark>IBM</mark> had experimented before with jam sessions—relatively unstructured employee discussions around broad topics—both on the corporate intranet and in face-to-face off-site brainstorming sessions. But the 72-hour ValuesJam, held in July 2003, was the most ambitious, focusing as it did on the very nature and future of <mark>IBM</mark>. </P><P>One thing was clear: You wouldn’t be able to orchestrate a forum like this, the verbal equivalent of an improvisational jam session among jazz musicians. In the words of CEO Sam Palmisano, “It just took off.” But, much like a musical jam, the dialogue was informed by a number of themes: </P><H2>Forum 1. Company Values </H2><P>Do company values exist? If so, what is involved in establishing them? Most companies today have values statements. But what would a company look and act like that truly lived its beliefs? Is it important for <mark>IBM</mark> to agree on a set of lasting values that drive everything it does? </P><H2>Forum 2. A First Draft </H2><P>What values are essential to what <mark>IBM</mark> needs to become? Consider this list: 1. Commitment to the customer. 2. Excellence through <mark>innovation</mark>. 3. Integrity that earns trust. How might these values change the way we act or the decisions we make? Is there some important aspect or nuance that is missing? </P><H2>Forum 3. A Company’s Impact </H2><P>If our company disappeared tonight, how different would the world be tomorrow? Is there something about our company that makes a unique contribution to the world? </P><H2>Forum 4. The Gold Standard </H2><P>When is <mark>IBM</mark> at its best? When have you been proudest to be an <mark>IBM</mark>er? What happened, and what was uniquely meaningful about it? And what do we need to do—or change—to be the gold standard going forward?</P></DIV></ARTICLE-SIDEBAR><P>What happened after the jam?</P><P>Well, we got a mountain of employee comments. The team analyzed all of it, and it was clear that the proposed value statements needed to change to reflect some of the nuances and emotion people expressed. So, drawing on this analysis, along with other employee feedback, a small team settled on <mark>IBM</mark>’s new corporate values.</P><P>The first value is “dedication to every client’s success.” At one level, that’s pretty straightforward: Bring together all of <mark>IBM</mark>’s capability—in the laboratory, in the field, in the back office, wherever—to help solve difficult problems clients can’t solve themselves. But this is also a lot more than the familiar claim of unstinting customer service. “Client success” isn’t just “the customer is always right.” It means maintaining a long-term relationship where what happens after the deal is more important than what happens before it’s signed. It means a persistent focus on outcomes. It means having skin in the game of your client’s success, up to and including how your contracts are structured and what triggers your getting paid.</P><P>The second is “<mark>innovation</mark> that matters—for our company and for the world.” When employees talked about <mark>IBM</mark> making a difference in the world, they included more than our work of inventing and building great products. They talked about how their work touches people and society, how we can help save lives—say, through our cutting-edge work with the Mayo Clinic or by helping governments fight terrorism with our data technology. This kind of <mark>innovation</mark> is a major reason we are able to attract great scientists. They can do cool stuff and maybe make more money in Silicon Valley—for a while, anyway—but they can do work that actually changes business and society at <mark>IBM</mark>. And it’s also about what I mentioned before: a continually experimental attitude toward <mark>IBM</mark> itself. Over most of our 90 years, with the exception of that one period when we became arrogant and complacent, this company never stopped questioning assumptions, trying out different models, testing the limits—whether in technology or business or in progressive workforce policies. Employees reminded us that those things are <mark>innovation</mark>s that matter at least as much as new products.</P><P>The third value is “trust and personal responsibility in all relationships.” There’s a lot in that statement, too. Interestingly, the feedback from employees on this value has focused on relationships among people at <mark>IBM</mark>. But we’re also talking about the company’s relationships with suppliers, with investors, with governments, with communities.</P><P>We published the values in their final form—along with some elaboration on them and some direct employee postings from the jam—in November 2003. Over the next ten days, more than 200,000 people downloaded the online document. The responses just flooded in, both in the form of postings on the intranet and in more than a thousand e-mails sent directly to me, telling us in often sharp language just where <mark>IBM</mark>’s operations fell short of, or clashed with, these ideals. Some of the comments were painful to read. But, again, they exhibited something every leader should welcome: People here aren’t complacent about the company’s future. And the comments were, by and large, extremely thoughtful.</P><P>What did you do with this feedback?</P><P>We collected and collated it. Then I printed all of it out—the stack of paper was about three feet high—and took it home to read over one weekend. On Monday morning, I walked into our executive committee meeting and threw it on the table. I said, “You guys ought to read every one of these comments, because if you think we’ve got this place plumbed correctly, think again.”</P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P>On Monday morning, I walked into our executive committee meeting and said, “You guys ought to read every one of these comments, because if you think we’ve got this place plumbed correctly, think again.”</P></DIV></DIV><P>Don’t get me wrong. The passion in these e-mails was positive as well as negative. People would say, literally, “I’m weeping. These values describe the company I joined, the company I believe in. We can truly make this place great again. But we’ve got all these things in our way.…” The raw emotion of some of the e-mails was really something.</P><P>Now, if you’ve unleashed all this frustration and energy, if you’ve invited people to feel hope about something they really care about, you’d better be prepared to do something in response. So, in the months since we finalized the values, we’ve announced some initiatives that begin to close the gaps.</P><P>One I have dubbed our “$100 million bet on trust.” We kept hearing about situations like our colleague in Tokyo who needed help from the engineer in Austin, cases in which employees were unable to respond quickly to client needs because of financial control processes that required several levels of management approval. The money would usually be approved, but too late. So we allocated managers up to $5,000 annually they could spend, no questions asked, to respond to extraordinary situations that would help generate business or develop client relationships or to respond to an <mark>IBM</mark>er’s emergency need. We ran a pilot for a few months with our 700 client-facing teams, and they spent the money intelligently. There were lots of examples of teams winning deals and delighting clients with a small amount of “walk around money” to spend at their discretion. So, based on the success of that pilot, we expanded the program to all 22,000 <mark>IBM</mark> first-line managers.</P><P>You can do the math: $5,000 times 22,000 managers is a big number. I’m sure there were people in the company who said, “We need to get this under control.” But they’re not the CEO. Yes, you need financial controls. Yes, not every dollar spent from this Managers’ Value Fund will yield some tangible return. But I’m confident that allowing line managers to take some reasonable risks, and trusting them with those decisions, will pay off over time. The program also makes a point: that we live by our values.</P><P>The value of “trust and personal responsibility in all relationships”—including those with <mark>IBM</mark>’s shareholders— led to another initiative: a change in the way we grant top executive stock options. After getting a lot of outside experts to study this (and concluding that the complicated algorithms they recommended were wonderful, if you wanted to hire the outsiders as permanent consultants, but terrible if you wanted a simple formula that aligned executive behavior with shareholder interests), we settled on a straightforward idea. Senior executives will benefit from their options only after shareholders have realized at least 10% growth in their investments—that is, the strike price is 10% higher than the market price on the day the options are issued. Look at it this way: <mark>IBM</mark>’s market value would have to increase by $17 billion from that date before any of the execs realize a penny of benefit. We think we are the first large company to take such a radical step—and it grew out of our values.</P><P>Let me give you one more example. It may not sound like a big deal, but for us, it was radical. We overhauled the way we set prices. We heard time and again from employees about how difficult it was to put together a client-friendly, cross-<mark>IBM</mark> solution, one involving a variety of products and services at a single, all-inclusive price. We couldn’t do it. Every brand unit had its own P&amp;L, and all the people who determine prices had been organized by brand. Remember those 100,000 cells in our 3-d matrix? Our people were pulling their cross-<mark>IBM</mark> bids apart, running them through our financial-accounting system as separate bids for individual products and services. This was nuts, because it’s our ability to offer everything—hardware, software, services, and financing—that gives us a real advantage. When we bid on each of the parts separately, we go head-to-head against rivals by product: EMC in storage, say, or Accenture in services. This was tearing out the very heart of our strategy of integration, not to mention our unique kind of business-plus-technology <mark>innovation</mark>.</P><P>Let me give you a humorous (if somewhat discouraging) illustration. Every senior executive has responsibility for at least one major client—we call them “partnership accounts.” Our former CFO John Joyce, who now heads <mark>IBM</mark>’s services business, put together a deal for his account that involved some hardware, some software, and some services. He was told he couldn’t price it as an integrated solution. And he’s the CFO! So we figured out a way to set a single price for each integrated offering.</P><P>This sounds like a great business move. But what does it have to do with values? Wouldn’t you ultimately have decided you had to do that in any case?</P><P>To be honest, we’d been debating the pricing issue at the executive level for a long time. But we hadn’t done anything about it. The values initiative forced us to confront the issue, and it gave us the impetus to make the change. You know, there are always ingrained operations and habits of mind in any organization—I don’t care whether it’s a business or a university or a government. Well, the values and the jam were great inertia-busting vehicles. A small business in this place is $15 billion, and a big one is $40 billion. So you have senior vice presidents running <EM>Fortune</EM> 500–sized companies who aren’t necessarily looking for bright ideas from the CEO or some task force every day. But when you hear from so many of our people on the front lines, you can’t just ignore it. They’re crying out: “We say we value ‘client success,’ and we want to grow our business. This one thing is getting in the way of both!” You’ve got to pay attention—if not to me, then to them.</P><P>So we took the pricers—the people who set the prices for client bids—and we said to them, “You work for <mark>IBM</mark>. When there’s a cross-<mark>IBM</mark> bid with multiple products, you price it on the <mark>IBM</mark> income statement, not on the income statements of each product.” Needless to say, this involved a series of very difficult meetings with senior executives. There was a huge debate among the finance people about all the reasons why we couldn’t do it: “It will be too much work to reallocate all the costs and revenue of a project back to individual profit centers.” And they’re right: It isn’t easy, especially when we now have to certify everything. But the CFO was with me on this: After all, he’d seen the problem firsthand! And we made the change, so that now when we make a truly cross-<mark>IBM</mark> bid, we can optimize it for the client and for us.</P><P>This brings us back to the tension between soft values and hard financial metrics. In the long run, they shouldn’t conflict. But along the way, they’re going to be jabbing at each other. After all, people still have to make their numbers.</P><P>Certainly, there’s no getting around that in a commercial enterprise. But I think values inject balance in the company’s culture and management system: balance between the short-term transaction and the long-term relationship, balance between the interests of shareholders, employees, and clients. In every case, you have to make a call. Values help you make those decisions, not on an ad hoc basis, but in a way that is consistent with your culture and brand, with who you are as a company.</P><ARTICLE-PROMO class=""article-promo promo--half""><H4 class=""promo-title"">This article also appears in:</H4></ARTICLE-PROMO></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE-CONTENT></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Developed for the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction by AECOM and <mark>IBM</mark> (NYSE: <A href=""http://www.<mark>ibm</mark>.com/investor""><mark>IBM</mark></A>), with support from United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the European Commission, the Scorecard provides better access to information, knowledge resources and tools to effectively reduce risks from the impacts of natural hazards and <mark>climate change</mark>. This is part of United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction’s (UNISDR) Making Cities Resilient Campaign, which currently has 3,500 signatory cities.</P><P>Losses due to disasters from natural and man-made hazards including floods, storms and the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> are mounting and on average cost governments over US$300 billion globally each year. The Scorecard provides a set of assessments that cover the policy and planning, engineering, organisational, financial, social and environmental aspects of disaster resilience. Designed to be led by local government authorities, the Scorecard aims to assist in monitoring and reviewing progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction: 2015-2030, the global plan to reduce disaster losses.</P><P>Mr. Robert Glasser, the Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, said: “National governments have the primary responsibility of implementing the Sendai Framework working with many stakeholders, and the Scorecard is a valuable support.”</P><P>“Disaster resilience is a broad and complex endeavor that involves far more than just emergency response. It entails thinking, planning and collaborating between agencies, governments, private sector and communities in advance, during and after the event,” said Peter Williams, chief technology officer, <mark>IBM</mark> Big Green <mark>Innovation</mark>s. “The Disaster Resilience Scorecard for Cities is a highly effective way to bring city stakeholders together to anticipate, mitigate, prepare for and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner.”</P><P>“Applying the new scorecard can be an important first step towards building resilience to disasters. Based on the feedback we’ve received so far, we are confident the new Scorecard is pitched at an appropriate level to facilitate productive conversation – most likely through a short workshop – in cities,” said AECOM’s Ben Smith, director, <mark>sustainable</mark> development, and co-author of the scorecard. “It can help capture what works well and what needs to be improved and can support cities in establishing action plans and prioritising investment to improve their resilience. We’ve also developed supporting tools to make using the scorecard easier for cities.”</P><P>Greater Manchester in the U.K. participated in an EU funded pilot project to implement the Scorecard along with four other European cities, including Stoke on Trent, Amadora, Arvika and Jonkoping.</P><P>Kathy Oldham, Head of Civil Contingencies and Resilience Unit, Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA), commented: “Using the Disaster Resilience Scorecard gave us the opportunity to broaden and deepen our understanding of resilience, bringing together partners from across the city region in conversations to explore the different issues the Scorecard highlights. Using the framework of indicators and standards enabled us to create a snapshot of our current resilience, to build new relationships between organisations who have a role in mitigating the risks of emergencies and to draw on ideas and <mark>innovation</mark> from across the globe”</P><P>The Scorecard is structured around the United Nation’s 10 Essentials of Disaster Resilience to enable cities to identify priorities for investment and to track progress over time. The goal is to guide cities towards optimal resilience, while challenging complacency and reminding authorities and stakeholders that there is always more to be done to ensure lasting resilience. The new scorecard replaces UNISDR’s Local Government Self-Assessment Tool, with local governments now encouraged to use the scorecard to set baselines, identify gaps and develop action plans.</P><P>The Scorecard is a free self-assessment tool to be used by cities or local government agencies. The full scorecard can be accessed via the UNISDR website <A href=""http://www.unisdr.org/campaign/resilientcities/home/toolkit"">here</A>.</P><P><STRONG>About AECOM</STRONG>

The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP (<SPAN id=""”symbol_BX.N_13”""><A href=""/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=BX.N"">BX.N</A></SPAN>).    </P><P>Blackrock Inc (<SPAN id=""”symbol_BLK.N_14”""><A href=""/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=BLK.N"">BLK.N</A></SPAN>) Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump’s business forum, despite reservations about the White House <mark>climate</mark> decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors.    </P><P>General Motors Co (<SPAN id=""”symbol_GM.N_15”""><A href=""/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=GM.N"">GM.N</A></SPAN>) said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co’s (<SPAN id=""”symbol_F.N_16”""><A href=""/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=F.N"">F.N</A></SPAN>) new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group.  </P><P>In February, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump’s immigration policies. </P><DIV class=""container_28wm1""><DIV class=""attribution_o4ojT""><P class=""content_27_rw"">Editing by Matthew Lewis</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
