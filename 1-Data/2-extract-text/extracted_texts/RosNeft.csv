These documents, <A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html"">which you really should read in their entirety</A>, paint a troubling portrait of our President-elect. According to the as-yet-verified claims made in the 40-some pages of intelligence memos that comprise the dossier, Trump had been developed as a Russian asset over the past several years through an intricate campaign involving both blackmail and financial incentives. While there’s some question as to the accuracy of the claims, we’re told that the former British intelligence officer who prepared the materials, <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/12/christopher-steele-ex-mi6-officer-named-as-author-of-trump-dossier"">Christopher Steele</A>, is well-respected in the intelligence community. Not only that, but the <A href=""http://theweek.com/speedreads/672669/bbc-claims-second-source-backs-trump-dossier"">the BBC has come out to say that a second source has confirmed the claims</A>… Well, with all of that by way of background, I’d like to spend some time right now delving into one specific claim made at the end of the report involving Russia’s desire to see Trump installed as President in order to open up oil exploration in the Arctic.</P><P>As you may recall, I suggested some time ago that I thought that <A href=""http://markmaynard.com/2016/12/now-that-we-know-the-russians-plotted-to-get-trump-elected-what-are-we-going-to-do-about-it/"">Putin was interested in seeing Trump become President not just because he would allow Russia to do what it wanted in the Baltic states, but because, as President, Trump could help lift sanctions against Russia, thereby allowing their $500 billion oil exploration deal with Exxon to move forward in the Arctic</A>. Well, if you read to the very end of the intelligence document noted above, you will find the following mention of these sanctions and a financial offer that was apparently made to Trump on behalf of the largely state-owned Russian oil company <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<mark>Rosneft</mark>""><mark>Rosneft</mark></A>.</P><P>Yes, you read that right. Trump emissary Carter Page, according to this intelligence dossier, met with representatives of <mark>Rosneft</mark> to discuss the lifting of sanctions against Russia which had stopped their plans to drill in the Arctic. In return for lifting these sanctions, according to the report, Trump would be given a 19 percent stake in <mark>Rosneft</mark>…<I>Can someone please calculate 19 percent of $500 billion?</I></P><P>Here, by way of context, is a clip from something I’d written recently on <A href=""http://markmaynard.com/2017/01/of-course-its-all-about-oil-putin-tump-and-the-campaign-to-keep-the-world-addicted-to-fossil-fuels/"">the role of oil in all of this</A>…</P><P><B>FROM THE POST “OF COURSE IT’S ALL ABOUT OIL”:</B></P><P>…To put it simply, Russia, despite the bluster, has been failing under Putin. Here, from The Diplomat, is a clip a 2014 article titled “<A href=""http://thediplomat.com/2014/03/russia-is-doomed/"">Russia is Doomed</A>.” This section relates specifically to the country’s energy reserves – one of four “pillars of Russian power” the authors describe as “steadily declining.”</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>…Another source of modern Russian power has been its massive energy reserves. Indeed, high oil prices during the 1970s allowed the Soviet Union to flex its muscles abroad. However, as energy prices stabilized during the 1980s the artifice upon which the Soviet system began to crumble. Far from continuing to expand, the end of the decade saw the Soviet empire disintegrate, with Moscow powerless to stop it.</I></P><P>The so-called resurgence Russia has enjoyed since Putin first assumed power has also been built on high energy prices. And like the Soviet leaders before him, Putin has squandered the temporary respite provided by high energy prices instead of using it to reinvest in the country and its people. As the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development noted gloomily in December 2012, “Not only are Russian exports highly concentrated in natural resources, this concentration has increased over time: the shares of oil, gas and other minerals in Russia’s exports are higher today than they were 15 years ago.”</P><P>It went on to reflect: “In 2012 Russia remains highly dependent on its natural resources. Oil and gas now account for nearly 70 percent of total goods exports…. Oil and gas revenues also contribute around half of the federal budget. The non-oil fiscal deficit has averaged more than 11 per cent of GDP since 2009, while the oil price consistent with a balanced budget is now in the region of US$115 per barrel and rising.”</P><P>The problem with the Russian Federation’s economic model, much like that of the Soviet Union’s before it, is that it is only <mark>sustainable</mark> so long as energy prices remain artificially high. But, of course, energy prices are almost certainly going to decline over the coming years as a result of greater energy efficiency in the West, slowing growth in the East, and greater supply as a result of the energy revolutions being enjoyed in the Western Hemisphere and elsewhere around the world. And as goes the price of oil so goes the Russian state…</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Be sure to go back and read that last paragraph, in case you missed it… The Russian economic model is only <mark>sustainable</mark> “so long as energy prices remain artificially high.” And, more importantly, “energy prices are almost certainly going to decline over the coming years as a result of greater energy efficiency in the West.” So, as the world migrates to renewables, the Russian state, having not diversified, is going to suffer…<I>Unless, of course, the West stops the migration to renewables.</I></P><P>In March 2014, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham summed it up rather well. Russia, he said, is merely “an oil and gas company masquerading as a country.” Some took offense at the comment. From what I’ve seen, though, most saw quite a bit of truth in it. The Carnegie organization, for instance, after saying that Graham’s assertion came across as absurd at first blush, essentially acquiesced, detailing in a 2014 report just how “<A href=""http://carnegie.ru/commentary/?fa=61272""> heavily dependent on oil</A>” Russia’s economy was.</P><P>So, <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-06/wind-and-solar-are-crushing-fossil-fuels"">as solar and wind are beginning to outperform fossil fuels</A>, we have this former super-power that has essentially put all of its eggs in the “oil and gas” basket, refusing to either invest in renewables, or, for that matter, diversify their economy in any way. Instead, they continue, as Sarah Palin would say, to “<A href=""https://youtu.be/seXMIHgMFj8?t=1m32s"">drill, baby, drill</A>,” ignoring the reality of global <mark>climate change</mark> and the fact that wind and solar are growing more competitive by the day.</P><P>OK, so here’s where things get interesting… Once Trump was elected (thanks, in large part, to Russia’s help), he promptly named <A href=""http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/309813-trump-picks-exxon-ceo-tillerson-for-secretary-of-state-report"">Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, a close collaborator with the Russians, to be his Secretary of State</A>… Here, from CNN, is a clip about <A href=""http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/11/investing/rex-tillerson-exxon-russia-putin/index.html"">Tillerson’s deep economic ties to Russia</A>.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>…In 2013, Vladimir Putin awarded ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson the Order of Friendship, one of the highest honors Russia gives to foreign citizens…</I></P><P>The 64-year-old Tillerson, a lifetime Exxon employee, came up through the ranks by managing the company’s Russia account…</P><P>In fact, his close relationship with Russia is one of the major reasons Tillerson was selected to succeed Lee Raymond as CEO of Exxon (XOM) in 2006, according to Steve Coll’s book “Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power.”</P><P>Once he became CEO, Exxon bet billions on Russia’s vast but notoriously-elusive oil resources through a bold partnership with Russian oil giant <mark>Rosneft</mark>. Putin himself attended the 2011 signing ceremony for the deal with <mark>Rosneft</mark>, which is majority owned by Moscow.</P><P>Russia has already indicated it would welcome Tillerson being named America’s top diplomat.</P><P>“Trump continues to amaze,” Alexey Pushkov, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russian parliament, said on Twitter. He said that selecting Tillerson would be a “sensation” and noted he has “a lot of experience working with Russia”…</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Here are Tillerson and Putin together, sharing a laugh. Judging by how happy they look, I’d say it was taken either since Trump won, or prior to 2014, <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/trump-putin-and-exxonmobil-team-up-to-destroy-the-planet-fb88650acfa1#.2x6agtshx"">when sanctions levied by the Obama administration killed a $500 billion dollar oil joint exploration venture in the Arctic between Russia and Exxon</A>.</P><P>And that’s what I think all of this is really about, when you strip everything else away. This is about not just killing NATO, and allowing Russia to re-exert its dominance in Europe, but ensuring that oil remain our global currency.</P><P>Obama, to put it simply, was bad for big oil. And that’s a big reason why Trump is now our President-elect.</P><P>Obama killed a $500 billion dollar oil project in the Artic, so Putin invested in a candidate who would not only give him what he wanted in the Arctic, but also effectively stop research into alternative energy, global <mark>climate change</mark>, etc. [Relevant recent headlines: “<A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/trump-zero-out-federal-clean-energy-56cca794790#.fah90vxlx"">Trump just proposed ending all federal clean energy development</A>,”“<A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/09/trump-transition-team-for-energy-department-seeks-names-of-employees-involved-in-<mark>climate</mark>-meetings/"">Trump transition team for Energy Department seeks names of employees involved in <mark>climate</mark> meetings</A>“] It’s difficult to imagine that Putin could have dreamed of a better scenario. Not only will Exxon be running the State Department, but the United States – the world’s largest market – will remain on the oil teat for the foreseeable future.</P><P>END QUOTE</P><P>And now, if this intelligence dossier is to be believed, we know just what it cost the Russian’s to get Trump to dismiss global warming, shut down <mark>climate</mark> research and open up the Arctic. Again, I think we have a good case for treason. Let’s hope our elected officials pursue it. The future of planet is at stake. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Greenpeace is holding a series of actions to prevent Gazprom from completing the work that will allow them to begin drilling in this fragile region.

Mega US and international oil companies have partnered with Russian oil companies who not only have a horrendous track record of environmental safety and regulation, but also have little to no offshore drilling experience and little interest in a positive public image.



So far Exxon, BP, Statoil and Eni have partnered with Rosfneft, a government-owned oil company, while Shell has joined Gazprom, Russian's largest company, in what you might call an ecological death squad. What do these companies get out of shaking hands and sealing the deal? In exchange for access to the Russian Arctic and the continental shelf, the international oil companies will provide capital and technical expertise.



Theyre going to need it.

<H2>6. <mark>Rosneft</mark> is responsible for 75 percent of spills in Russians largest oil province while extracting only 25 percent of the total regional output.</H2>

This fact isn't that surprising considering the company also has the lowest overall safety budget.



[caption id=&quot;attachment_19186&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;] An oil spill at the <mark>Rosneft</mark> oil field,[/caption]

<H2>5. No director or member of the Gazprom board of directors has a lick of offshore experience. Suppose they left Must have experience in oil drilling off the job descriptions?</H2>In addition to Gazprom having no experienced leadership on offshore drilling, <mark>Rosneft</mark> is no expert either. In fact, they have never operated an offshore project to an extraction stage. Meaning the thing that they're trying to do in one of the most fragile and crucial ecosystems in the world, they've actually never done before.

<H2>4. Gazprom ordered a<A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-16/russia-s-biggest-company-orders-3-7-million-tablet-for-ceo.html"" target=""_blank"">$3.7 million tablet for its CEO</A>claiming it was crucial to running the business more efficiently. Because a fancy iPad is all you need to run an oil company.</H2>

While millions of dollars can buy you a fancy tablet, it apparently can't buy you offshore drilling experience.

<H2>3. In 2011, Gazprom rig, the Kolskaya, sank off the coast of Russia killing 53 of its 67 crew members in the frigid Pacific Ocean. <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/world/europe/oil-rig-sinks-in-storm-off-russia-49-missing.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">This sinking actually killed more people than the BP Deepwater disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.</A></H2>

While in tow from Russia, the rig hit a storm and sank within 20 minutes. While not drilling when it sank, the incident was certainly a setback for a company with plans for more Arctic drilling.

<H2>2. Vladimir Putin is encouraging Exxon and <mark>Rosneft</mark> to start their new partnership off with a bang and <A href=""http://newseurope.me/2013/07/16/putin-urges-<mark>rosneft</mark>-and-exxon-mobil-to-start-joint-projects-in-gulf-of-mexico/"" target=""_blank"">head for the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico.</A>If any company knows how to one up BP on oil spills, its <mark>Rosneft</mark>.</H2>

Broadcasting straight from a drilling rig,Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed his enthusiasm for the Exxon/<mark>Rosneft</mark> joint venture, and suggested they set their sights on the Gulf of Mexico.

<H2>1. <mark>Rosneft</mark> is so big, bad and evil that the band Pussy Riot chose them as the target of their <A href=""http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/pussy-riot-releases-its-first-song-and-video-since-the-jailing-of-its-three-members/?ref=<mark>rosneft</mark>"" target=""_blank"">first video</A> after being released from prison.</H2>

The group said the goal of their latest video was to highlight the corrupt relationship of the Russian government, particularly President Putin, and energy companies. The band members were previously sentenced to two years in prison for &quot;hooliganism.&quot;

That will represent a savage reduction on 2014’s spend, said in October to be $14bn-$16bn. It follows cuts announced recently by other major firms around the world totalling $65bn.</P><P>Although predicting continued volatility and saying he did not want to get into a “guessing game”, he said the oil price could start to rise again in the final quarter of this year. This was because the current oversupply of oil was insignificant compared with previous oil crises like 1985, so the fundamental supply and demand equation did not justify the current price slump. Moreover, demand is rising, primarily in Asia, and not falling like it was in 1985, he said.</P><P>He repeatedly expressed his concerns that there could be a global shortage of oil if companies did not return to investing in production and output.</P><FIGURE class=""inline-media align-none""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption"">President of Russian petroleum company <mark>Rosneft</mark>, Igor Sechin, participates in a press conference in 2013</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>If investment levels recovered, next year’s price would be $60-$80 a barrel, he said. However, if they do not, and the supply-demand equation was not rebalanced, it could bounce back to $100-$110 as the lack of investment in drilling caused a shortfall in production.</P><P>He talked for the first time of his close bond with the senior management of BP, particularly Bob Dudley, the US-born chief executive who famously fled Russia in fear of his safety during BP’s battle with the oligarch partners of its BP-TNK joint venture.</P><P>And, speaking after <mark>Rosneft</mark>’s legal case against EU sanctions was sent from the High Court in London to the European Court of Justice, he declared: “We are fighting: the knot will be untied.”</P><P>Mr Sechin said <mark>Rosneft</mark> was prepared for a long haul in its battle to overturn the sanctions, placed on both him and the company by the US and EU authorities in response to the Ukraine conflict.</P><P>Asked about the prospects of the time extension of the case’s move from London to the European Court, he said wryly: “Instead of three years, the case may be a year and a half… What can you do? I don’t know if the case will be tried on merit and our claims will be justly reviewed and evaluated.”</P><P>He attacked the European authorities for the way the sanctions were applied in such a way to ban legal appeals against them: “That is what concerns me most… The EU imposed a ban in the European Court on accepting claims from Russian entities and individuals that have been subjected to sanctions. [This] has severe consequences, including consequences for European democracy. Is there an independent rule of law?”</P><P>Asked what his message would be to the governments of Europe, Britain and the US about the sanctions situation, he declared: “I am not a politician. I am just a manager. I can only wish them success in building a multipolar world for the benefit of all countries and nations.” </P><FIGURE class=""inline-media i-gallery align-""><H2>Biggest oil producers (IEA figures)</H2><DIV class=""thumbnails""><BUTTON class=""gallery-btn"" on=""tap:gallery-lightbox-3395221""><SPAN class=""count-wrap""><SPAN class=""count"">

All those will face severe consequences.”</P><P>He added: “The world economy will face severe consequences. The application of sanctions against the company cannot be justified. We are not a subject of political decisions, so the extension of sanctions to the corporate level is absolutely illegal and illegitimate.”</P><P>He said it was not just Russians who suffered: 300,000 German jobs rely on equipment supplies to Russia.</P><P>Mr Sechin spoke at length about the current turmoil of the global oil market, saying the speed of the 2014 crisis exceeded anything before. Oil has crashed from $115 a barrel in June to just $57 today.</P><P>But despite <mark>Rosneft</mark>’s plans to reduce expenditure, he declared there would be no job cuts among its 235,000-strong workforce because the company is hiring crews to develop its in-house capabilities so as to rely less on outside contractors.</P><P>In the UK oil industry, Mr Sechin is best-known for the way he drove negotiations to strike a $53bn deal with BP and a group of Soviet-born oligarchs.</P><P>BP had tried with Mr Sechin to form an alliance with <mark>Rosneft</mark> in 2011 to jointly develop Russia’s Arctic shelf. But BP was already in a joint venture on Russia called TNK-BP with a group of oligarchs and Russia’s Alfa Bank. These partners, known as the AAR consortium, were outraged at the proposed BP-<mark>Rosneft</mark> alliance and successfully had it overturned in court. It was seen as a severe blow both to Mr Dudley and Mr Sechin.</P><P>Relations between the oligarchs and BP went from bad to worse until BP eventually declared it wanted to sell its stake in TNK-BP.</P><FIGURE class=""inline-media align-none""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption"">Russian oil giant <mark>Rosneft</mark> have their headquarters in Moscow</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Mr Sechin said <mark>Rosneft</mark> would buy it. This was seen as a tactical manoeuvre to force the oligarchs to sell their half to <mark>Rosneft</mark> as well: Mr Sechin guessed AAR would never want to be joint shareholders in a Russian state-owned company run by Mr Putin’s right-hand man. The plan worked: BP sold its stake for $22bn plus a 20 per cent stake in <mark>Rosneft</mark> – a deal totalling $28bn. <mark>Rosneft</mark> paid AAR $27.73bn in cash in a deal closed in March 2013.</P><P>However, that transaction was completed when the oil price was above $100 a barrel, leading to accusations recently that <mark>Rosneft</mark> overpaid while the oligarchs and Alfa-Bank got the deal of the century.</P><P>But Mr Sechin refuted this when asked if he regretted the price: “Regret is not the word here. I think we can be proud we had the opportunity to strike a deal this complicated. We continue to increase synergy so the efficiency of the acquisition grows.”</P><P>He denied talk of a cantankerous relationship with the oligarchs, saying of the deal process: “You need to understand how challenging that job itself was, and how different the [various parties’] interests were. And everyone was standing their ground… During the stages that led to execution of that deal we did have some rough moments and we did have some discussions but that did not lead to any tensions in terms of personal relationships.”</P><P>Asked how he felt about the oligarchs now, he said: “They are very decent people, all of them.” He recently met Alfa-Bank chief Petr Aven. “He said he was missing me,” Mr Sechin laughed.</P><P>The long period of working with BP over the years had led to a strong bond with BP chief executive Mr Dudley and his predecessor Tony Hayward, who left in the aftermath of the Gulf of Mexico spill. “We have known each other for a long time. I am very familiar and very well acquainted with the members of the board and directors of BP.</P><P>“That is what I call trust and mutual consideration. Those things helped us successfully go through that enormous transaction – the largest acquisition in the history of oil and gas.”</P><P>The TNK transaction has left <mark>Rosneft</mark> with huge debts to repay. Given the collapse in the oil price and sanctions on the company, some investors have been concerned whether repayments are affordable, with some speculation <mark>Rosneft</mark> may seek to renegotiate terms or even default.</P><FIGURE class=""inline-media align-none""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption"">Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Igor Sechin (left) push the button launching a new oil terminal at the Black Sea port of Tuapse in 2012</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P> </P><P>But Mr Sechin said: “I do not think there is any need to renegotiate it. We are managing all the payment schedules.”</P><P>Yesterday, the company paid the latest instalment of $7bn. Mr Sechin said other payments would also be made, adding: “The basis for our optimism is the actual economic performance of the company. Last year, the company’s revenue was $146bn.”</P><P>He dismissed talk of drawing on Russian state funds, saying repayments would be met from internal company funds. Despite the pressures faced by the company, it would also continue paying its dividend at 25 per cent of net profits.</P><P>The TNK-BP deal was one of the biggest steps in the Kremlin’s regrouping of Russia’s energy assets, which were split up during the Yeltsin era and sold often on the cheap to the oligarchs.</P><P>Asked if he might consider more deals, such as a takeover of Lukoil, he laughed, saying: “What does Lukoil have to do with that? In crisis there is always a good opportunity for mergers and acquisitions, but we are not looking at Lukoil.” He later added: “We don’t comment on the rumours. There is no such offer on the market now. That is why we do not comment on it.”</P><P>Sechin also denied speculation that <mark>Rosneft</mark> aims to consolidate the sector more generally: “This is impossible, these options will never be considered. The Russian oil and gas industry constitutes a part of the global oil and gas sector, foreign investors own around 25 per cent of it. And I would like to reiterate that <mark>Rosneft</mark> did not receive its assets through privatisation but acquired them on market-based terms – by paying for them.”</P><P>Mr Sechin also warned of the risk of manipulation of the oil market by financial investors and those “paper traders” who speculate on the price. He raised parallels with Libor fixing and the bogus valuations by credit rating agencies of US sub-prime mortgages.</P><P>The shares of US shale oil producers resembled the dotcom bubble of 1999, he hinted, pointing out that European exploration and production companies’ shares fell 42 per cent last year while US shale oil producers were still at January 2014 levels.</P><P>“Is it another bubble?” he asked.</P><P>He cited the example of America’s EOG, which is valued 34 per cent higher than Lukoil despite having 3.9 times lower reserves.</P><P>He also railed against the US for protectionism, saying: “Can you answer a simple question: why have the US been restricting oil exports from their country for 40 years? They are protecting their own refineries. They are providing competitive advantage for American refining.</P><P>“Can you imagine the same actions taken by someone like the Russian Federation? Let’s say Russia said ‘no more oil exports: refined products only’. What do you think the market would feel?… But we’re not taking that path. One needs to be reasonable.”</P><P><STRONG>Not so green: Sechin on the environment</STRONG></P><P>Igor Sechin is unlikely to win any awards from Greenpeace. He joked of how, at a conference this week where he was speaking, a member of the audience said people should be limited to alternative energy sources.</P><P>“I can tell you I am not a big expert in that area but I know a few things. First of all, we are the subject of global <mark>climate change</mark> cycles. I actually comforted the guy. I said: ‘Those cycles repeat every 30 million years, so everything is normal. The human effect on the environment is less than any volcano. A volcanic eruption produces more <mark>Co2</mark> than any human activity. The rotting of algae in the ocean significantly exceeds any man-made effect, so one should be calm about it.”</P><P>He did praise alternative energy, but stressed that it was expensive and that consumers would have to pay extra for it. “I am confidently saying that there should be no barriers. Both oil and gas need to be produced.</P><P>“Energy security needs to be provided for economic growth and the increase of people’s wealth throughout the planet.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></BODY></HTML>"

He had the evidence of an Austrian explorer with a “photographic memory” who said melting glaciers and ice cover had started almost 90 years ago.</P><P>Putin didn’t name the explorer, but said he had visited the Franz Josef Land archipelago in 1930, where Putin himself had been the day before his remarks.</P><P>Twenty years after that, the explorer was shown photographs of another expedition taken of the area by “the future King of Italy” and, according to Putin, the explorer concluded there were fewer icebergs than when he had been there.</P><P>“That’s when there were no such anthropological factors, such emissions, and the warming had already started,” said Putin. Based on this flimsy account, Putin said there was nothing to be done about <mark>climate change</mark>, and that it was all bound up with something well beyond humanity’s control anyway.</P><P>“The issue is not stopping it, because that’s impossible since it could be tied to some global cycles on Earth or even of planetary significance,” Putin said.</P><P class=""image  align-left""><SPAN class=""caption"" style=""width: 300px !important;"">
			Putin at the Arctic: Territory of Dialogue conference. (Photo: Courtesy of Mikhail Metzel, TASS)		</SPAN></P><P>But it doesn’t have to be all bad.</P><P>“<mark>Climate change</mark> brings in more favorable conditions and improves the economic potential of this region,” he told <A href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/30/vladimir-putin-russia-trump-us-<mark>climate</mark>-policy.html"">CNBC</A> from the conference. “Today, Russia’s GDP is the result of the economic activity of this region.”</P><P>Putin hasn’t called <mark>climate change</mark> a “<A href=""https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en"">hoax</A>” perpetrated by the Chinese, like Donald Trump famously has, but the two men are fond of signaling major policy changes that fly in the face of evidence, science and common sense by citing the advice of vague friends and acquaintances.</P><P>Trump, for instance, has a “<A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/trump-bernhard-langer-voting-fraud.html"">very famous</A>” German golfing buddy who can prove that he won his squeaker election by many millions more votes than he actually did. Likewise, Trump’s “very, very substantial” <A href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/13/who-is-trumps-friend-jim"">Francophile friend</A> “John” told him that Paris has turned into a rat’s nest of refugee terrorists, and cited that to justify a US immigration ban. No one has yet been able to figure out if John is real.</P><P>But that’s beside the point. Putin and Trump’s friends – real or imagined – are drawing them together, and these friends are apparently urging them following each other’s cues on environmental policy.</P><P>Putin’s shift on <mark>climate change</mark> – which he told the United Nations <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference in Paris in 2015 “has become one of the most serious challenges facing humanity” – came with a big wink to the Trump administration.</P><P>Last week, Trump instructed <A href=""http://bellona.org/news/fossil-fuels/2016-12-trump-chooses-<mark>climate</mark>-denier-whos-suing-the-epa-to-run-it"">Scott Pruitt</A>, his appointee to run the Environmental Protection Agency who has said loudly he doesn’t believe <mark>climate change</mark> is real, <A href=""http://bellona.org/news/<mark>climate</mark>-change/international-<mark>climate</mark>-conferences/2017-03-trump-poised-take-first-steps-against-<mark>climate</mark>-action-%c2%ac-and-trip-into-a-legal-morass"">to start undoing the Obama era Clean Power Plan</A>, a policy to limit greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning power plants. The plan formed the cornerstone of America’s commitment to the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement, in which 194 countries agreed to meet national benchmarks in reducing planet-warming emissions.</P><P>Two days later, Trump’s press spokesman Sean Spicer signaled the administration would decide whether America would pull out of Paris – as Trump threatened to do on the campaign trail – by next month.</P><P>From the Arctic conference, Putin praised Pruitt, telling CNBC that people like the EPA administrator “who are not in agreement with opponents may not be at all silly.”</P><P>While Putin reaffirmed Russia’s commitment to reaching Paris goals, he again massaged the Trump administration by demurring to comment on the White House’s seeming desire to buck the agreement.</P><P>“I would not dramatize things, and I wouldn’t use these global factors for the domestic American political struggle,” he told CNBC.</P><P>He might do well to stay silent: While US Congress the Senate, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are probing possible Kremlin meddling undergirding Trump’s surprise presidential victory, their collusion in public to undermine the Paris Accord could hardly be more obvious.</P><P>Central to that <A href=""http://bellona.org/news/fossil-fuels/2017-01-putin-hacks-his-own-election-tarring-paris-accord-with-exxonmobil-oil"">potential backstairs relationship</A> might be the Arctic’s vast reserves of oil. A $500 billion deal between Exxon Mobil, formerly headed by Trump’s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and Russia’s <mark>Rosneft</mark> oil company to drill the Arctic was put on ice when the Obama Administration imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014. Trump’s opponent Hillary Clinton, was unlikely to repeal those sanctions, but Trump has said he might.</P><P>To further persuade him, Putin and his Austrian explorer friend apparently see the benefit in endorsing Trump’s destructive <mark>climate change</mark> denial.</P><P><EM>Anna Kireeva contributed to this report.</EM></P><P> </P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Which was more important to you in the past election? And how do you view the appointment of Scott Pruitt as the new administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency? <STRONG>William Reilly:</STRONG> I decided several elections ago that I could no longer support a presidential candidate who rejected the science on <mark>climate change</mark>. Republican presidential candidates up through John McCain in 2008 did accept the science, and McCain was even the lead GOP sponsor of the <mark>climate</mark> bill, McCain-Lieberman, in the Senate. For a prospective EPA administrator to doubt or even contest a conclusion that 11 national academies of science have embraced is willful political obstruction. By all reports, Scott Pruitt is a highly intelligent lawyer and he has cited no alternative scientific authority that disputes mainstream science. Science is the secular religion underlying everything EPA does, and one who cannot rely on it, or is determinedly contemptuous of it, cannot effectively lead the agency or serve as the country’s environmental conscience, which is EPA’s unique mission.</P><P><STRONG>e360:</STRONG> What was your first thought when you heard that Scott Pruitt will lead the agency? </P><P><STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> There has never been a more explicit and opposing interpretation of the authority and responsibility of EPA by an EPA nominee. Scott Pruitt has petitioned to reverse President Obama’s Clean Power rule to reduce <mark>CO2</mark> from electric generating plants. These account for about a third of U.S. <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions, and so the rule is one of the major pillars of the U.S. effort to avert catastrophic <mark>climate change</mark>. I have submitted a legal brief vigorously disputing Pruitt’s interpretation of the law and the very role of EPA on <mark>climate</mark>. </P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">“One hopes that in four years someone claiming to be a Republican environmentalist won’t make people laugh.”</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P><STRONG>e360: </STRONG>Mr. Pruitt has sued the agency because it attempted to reduce methane emissions. Do you see that as a conflict of interest? </P><P><STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> I would not argue that Pruitt is conflicted because he has sued to overturn EPA’s methane rule. Lawyers argue cases, defend positions, represent clients — it’s what they do. The key question for Pruitt in his Senate confirmation is, what does he believe and propose to do as EPA administrator to reduce methane emissions? Many energy companies are working to reduce them. Does he have an alternative to the rule? Are these emissions tolerable? <STRONG>e360: </STRONG>How painful is Trump’s environmental policy for somebody like you who is both an environmentalist and a Republican? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> One hopes that in four years someone claiming to be a Republican environmentalist won’t make people laugh. A Republican — President Nixon — created the EPA precisely to avert a race to the bottom by states competing for polluting industries. Trump’s environmental positions, judging from the Republican Party platform and his campaign statements — <mark>climate change</mark> is a hoax conceived by the Chinese, the EPA should be dismantled and its authorities transferred to the states — would roll back the clock. <STRONG>e360:</STRONG> How was it possible that the Republicans stopped listening to scientific advice? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> This begins with the traditional conservative wariness about excesses of government and costs of regulation. The Tea Party, the coal mining industry and its workers, industry spokesmen who have blamed their decline on <mark>pollution</mark> controls, nativists who fear loss of sovereignty from the Paris agreements — all that is involved. <STRONG>e360:</STRONG> Who is the driving force within the Republican Party? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> When I have asked Republican Congress members who fully understand <mark>climate change</mark> but are constrained by constituent pressures, who is it that feels so strongly opposed to <mark>climate</mark> initiatives, they tell me it’s evangelicals. Evangelicals constitute something like a third of GOP voters, and they voted 80 percent for Donald Trump. Hence Republican office holders from the Southwest, for example, say that they would be defeated in their primaries if they were to vote for <mark>carbon</mark> regulation. <STRONG>e360: </STRONG>Do you think that the <mark>climate</mark>- and Earth-monitoring programs the U.S. government runs through agencies like NASA, NOAA, or EPA will survive four years of Trump? </P><P><STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> There will undoubtedly be efforts to muzzle them. The entire world will lose something very valuable if that is allowed to happen. Much of the science on <mark>climate</mark> — on causes, chemistry, and measuring <mark>climate change</mark> — has been done by U.S. agencies: NOAA [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], NASA, NCAR [the National Center for Atmospheric Research], EPA. The budgets and priorities of these agencies must be watched very carefully for they are likely to represent countervailing opinions to the administration’s <mark>climate</mark> deniers, and they won’t like it. <STRONG>e360:</STRONG> Speaking of NASA, what is your opinion about plans to cut its Earth-monitoring programs? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> Cuts in NASA’s Earth monitoring program would be so destructive, a reckless head-in-the-sand posture that says, “If we don’t look, then nothing bad will happen.” <STRONG>e360:</STRONG> If you were an EPA official — would you consider quitting? Do you have any advice? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> When I took office as EPA administrator in 1989, the environment had not been a priority for the eight years of the Reagan administration. However, after a scandalous two years when Reagan had a deregulator running EPA, the ship was righted and some good things got done, including the Montreal Protocol [to protect the ozone layer]. I had the good fortune to inherit many fine civil servants who had weathered the storm of attempted relaxation of environmental protections, and I was frankly amazed and impressed that some of the best people had stayed at the agency through the darkest years, even as their leader was fired and one senior official went to prison. So I would not advocate that committed people leave. We need them now more than ever! </P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">“If there is anything positive to say, I suppose it is to acknowledge that the president-elect is not an ideologue.”</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P><STRONG>e360:</STRONG> What will happen to U.S. renewable energy and to the Paris <mark>climate</mark> treaty now? </P><P><STRONG>Reilly: </STRONG>Last year, 60 percent of new solar installations were utility grade — that represents a breakthrough. I believe there is enough support in the Congress and the states to protect renewables, which are becoming competitive now. California, Texas, and other states will continue to support renewables. The good news in America is that the country is de<mark>carbon</mark>izing. The success of fracking, the resulting plentiful supply and low price of natural gas, is displacing coal and leading to annual stable or even decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, all without the Clean Power rule. </P><P><STRONG>e360:</STRONG> If Donald Trump puts his promises into effect, how will this affect the global efforts to limit <mark>climate change</mark>? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> One has to hope that the European Union and China stay the course set in Paris if Trump disavows the commitments. I was in Beijing recently and spoke with senior government officials. <mark>Pollution</mark> reduction is a major source of public anger and concern and as coal consumption comes down and <mark>pollution</mark> is reduced, so too will <mark>CO2</mark>. I worry more about India, which has been explicit that it will require outside financing if it’s to reduce its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint and honor its promises made in Paris. <STRONG>e360:</STRONG> Can you imagine an outside event that might change the current course of the Trump administration? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> I have long believed that, unfortunately, a catastrophe will be necessary to jolt American opinion to demand the urgent and sweeping measures required to avert severe inhospitable weather. American politics can turn on a dime. George Bush, who served for eight years as Ronald Reagan’s vice president, is the same man who promised in his campaign to be “the environmental president” and who appointed me, the president of the World Wildlife Fund at the time, as his EPA administrator, and who initiated a fabulously successful and cost-effective clean air law. <STRONG>e360:</STRONG> Are there positive aspects of Donald Trump’s environmental agenda? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> If there is anything positive to say, I suppose it is to acknowledge that the president-elect is not an ideologue, is not apparently a fervent <mark>climate</mark> denier, is someone who follows polling results and who presumably will be exposed to high-level briefings on science and <mark>climate</mark> which his entourage has not yet tapped. There is also likely to be a reinvigoration of people and groups determined to ensure that states and cities adapt and prepare for <mark>climate change</mark> and promote the energy efficiencies, renewables, water conservation, and agricultural transformation that will help people flourish and prosper even as the earth warms and the sea level rises. <STRONG>e360:</STRONG> Is the appointment of Rex Tillerson, CEO of Exxon, as Secretary of State the death-blow for U.S. environmental policy? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> I would offer a counter-intuitive measure of respect. It was Tillerson who discontinued his predecessor’s funding of <mark>climate</mark> deniers. He imposed a high shadow <mark>carbon</mark> price when assessing the anticipated returns from capital investments. He has publicly supported a <mark>carbon</mark> tax and has acknowledged the science and characterized <mark>climate change</mark> as a serious challenge. I know from my experience as co-chair of President Obama’s Commission on the BP Gulf of Mexico disaster that ExxonMobil’s competitors and peers regard the company as the most environmentally effective and safety conscious of all the major [oil companies]. For that reason, I asked him to speak at one of our hearings and to explain how his company had transformed itself after its own disaster in Alaska [the Exxon Valdez oil spill] in 1989 when I was EPA administrator. </P></DIV><ASIDE class=""article__block article__block--footnoteBlock article__block--footnoteBlock--align-left"" role=""complementary""><H3 class=""footnote-head"">Words of Caution on <mark>Climate</mark> From Obama's Top Scientist</H3><P>In an interview with <EM>Yale e360</EM>, President Obama’s chief science adviser, John Holdren, talks about the urgency of the <mark>climate</mark> challenge and why he hopes the next administration will not abandon efforts to address it. <A href=""https://e360.yale.edu/features/obama_top_scientist_words_of_caution_<mark>climate</mark>_john_holdren"">Read more.</A></P></ASIDE><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P><STRONG>e360:</STRONG> There are fears he will team up with the authoritarian government of Russia to help fossil fuel exploitation in the Arctic. </P><P><STRONG>Reilly:  </STRONG>His familiarity with Russia is deep, and I suspect he has no illusions. He has stated that Russia has no rule of law. As to whatever major exploration Russia and ExxonMobil may do in the Arctic, my own knowledge of the industry would indicate that most Arctic countries — Canada, Norway, Greenland, the U.S. — are all planning major Arctic exploration and investments. So better <mark>Rosneft</mark> [the state-owned Russian oil company] has a responsible partner. As to the sanctions, one must hope that he views them through a different lens once he speaks not for his company, but for America. And let’s be serious: Compared with some of the names mentioned for Secretary of State, Tillerson is safe hands. </P><P><STRONG>e360:</STRONG> Is it an option to just wait for four years until the Trump presidency is over and then move on? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> For some time there has been the sense that serious <mark>climate</mark> disruptions are likely to confront our grandchildren, not us. Current forecasts indicate problems are more imminent. Midwestern plant zone changes have already led Chicago to cease planting Norway spruce, maple, and ash trees in the parks. Termites, tropical diseases, and bark beetles all are flourishing and moving into warming regions. Zika and dengue fever are in Florida and Texas. The problem, the challenge, is upon us. Time is important, and it appears the nation will not lead on the most urgent planetary challenge in modern history, which is profoundly saddening. But Washington is not the only locus of change and policy in America, and competing centers of influence are mobilizing in this very big and dynamic country. None of us who care are giving up. </P></DIV></SECTION></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

      have agreed to expand their cooperation under their 2011 Strategic 
      Cooperation Agreement to include an additional approximately 600,000 
      square kilometers (150 million acres) of exploration acreage in the 
      Russian Arctic and potential participation by <mark>Rosneft</mark> (or its affiliate) 
      in the Point Thomson project in Alaska. They have also agreed to conduct 
      a joint study on a potential LNG project in the Russian Far East.
    </P><P>
      The agreements, which include plans to explore seven new blocks in the 
      Chukchi Sea, Laptev Sea and Kara Sea, were signed by Igor Sechin, 
      president of <mark>Rosneft</mark>, and Stephen Greenlee, president of ExxonMobil 
      Exploration Company, in the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    </P><P>
      The license blocks include Severo-Vrangelevsky-1, Severo-Vrangelevsky-2 
      and Yuzhno-Chukotsky blocks in Chukchi Sea, Ust’ Oleneksky, Ust’ Lensky 
      and Anisinsko Novosibirsky blocks in Laptev Sea and Severo Karsky block 
      in Kara Sea, which are among the most promising and least explored 
      offshore areas globally.
    </P><P>
      A separate Heads of Agreement was signed providing <mark>Rosneft</mark> (or its 
      affiliate) an opportunity to acquire a 25 percent interest in the Point 
      Thomson Unit, which covers development of a remote natural gas and 
      condensate field on Alaska’s North Slope. It is estimated that Point 
      Thomson contains approximately 25 percent of the known gas resource base 
      in Alaska’s North Slope.
    </P><P>
      <mark>Rosneft</mark> and ExxonMobil also executed a Memorandum of Understanding to 
      jointly study the economic viability of an LNG development in the 
      Russian Far East, including the possible construction of an LNG 
      facility. The companies will form a joint working group, which is 
      expected to commence work in the coming weeks to study the viability of 
      an LNG project using available natural gas resources.
    </P><P>
      Commenting on the agreements signed, Igor Sechin said, “The agreements 
      signed today bring the already unprecedented scale of the <mark>Rosneft</mark> and 
      ExxonMobil partnership up to a completely new level. The acreage in the 
      Russian Arctic subject to geological exploration and subsequent 
      development increased nearly six-fold. That means the enormous resource 
      potential of Russian Arctic offshore fields will be explored and 
      developed in the most efficient manner with the application of 
      cutting-edge technologies and expertise of our strategic partner, 
      ExxonMobil, and using state-of-the-art environmental protection systems. 
      Participation in the Point Thomson project will increase <mark>Rosneft</mark>’s 
      access to the latest gas and condensate field development technologies 
      used in harsh climatic conditions.”
    </P><P>
      Stephen Greenlee said the agreements build on the ongoing successful 
      cooperation between the companies. “This expansion is an illustration of 
      the strength of the partnership that exists between ExxonMobil and 
      <mark>Rosneft</mark>,” said Greenlee. “We look forward to working together on these 
      new projects.”
    </P><P>
      The companies are committed to using global best practices and 
      state-of-the-art safety and environmental protection systems for the 
      Arctic operations. The work will be supported by the recently signed 
      Declaration on the Russian Arctic Shelf Environmental protection. Also, 
      ExxonMobil and <mark>Rosneft</mark> will work together through an Arctic Research 
      Center to provide a full range of research and design services to 
      support their cooperation on Arctic projects.
    </P><P>
      <mark>Rosneft</mark> and ExxonMobil continue to implement a program of staff 
      exchanges of technical and management employees to help strengthen 
      relationships between the companies.

</P><P>An industry source said <mark>Rosneft</mark> could not increase ESPO loadings at Russia's Kozmino due to the Pacific port's capacity limits. Kozmino can load 2.6 million to 2.8 million tons of ESPO Blend a month, with <mark>Rosneft</mark> accounting for about 1 million.
</P><P><mark>Rosneft</mark> is already committed to selling a minimum of one cargo of ESPO a month to China National Petroleum Corp in a state-to-state deal, while China's Chemchina will receive one or two cargoes a month under a term contract.
</P><P>That leaves <mark>Rosneft</mark> with seven to nine cargoes a month to sell, which is the volume it has now agreed to send to CEFC.
</P><P>Trafigura declined to respond when asked about the shift in trade, saying it did not comment on commercial matters. <mark>Rosneft</mark> and CEFC did not respond to Reuters request for comment.
</P><P>Under its deal with <mark>Rosneft</mark>, CEFC plans to supply China's small, privately owned &quot;teapot&quot; refineries, which want ESPO due to lower transport costs compared with crude from other ports.
</P><P><mark>Rosneft</mark> has tended to shift between traders every few years. Gunvor once dominated <mark>Rosneft</mark>’s trade in Europe but then lost ground to Glencore and Vitol, which both offered prefinance contracts. Trafigura then took over as <mark>Rosneft</mark>'s biggest lifter of seaborne crude volumes in Europe and Asia.
</P><P>Although Trafigura now looks set to lose its top position in Asia, a trading source said it was expected to increase its presence in supplying <mark>Rosneft</mark>'s crude to Western destinations.
</P><P>&quot;If CEFC is likely to replace Trafigura in the East, I think <mark>Rosneft</mark> will think of some compensation for its old ally. There will be Urals to offer,&quot; he said.
</P><P><mark>Rosneft</mark>'s five-year prefinance contracts with Glencore and Vitol expire in March, which could free up about 1 million tons of Urals a month for April-December 2018, traders said. <mark>Rosneft</mark> has yet to indicate how that volume will be divided.

The alleged “urgency” of replacing fossil fuels with “eco-friendly renewable energy” (to prevent catastrophic manmade <mark>climate change</mark>) drives and excuses operations that define or barely skirt “corrupt practices.”</P><P>The arrangements are too convoluted to explain in one article. Even the U.S. Senate’s “<A href=""http://www.naro-us.org/Resources/NARO%20CA/NARO-CA,%20US%20Senate%20Minority%20Report,%20Billionaires%20Club%20(1).pdf"">Billionaires’ Club</A>” report, the Environmental Policy Alliance’s “<A href=""https://www.biggreenradicals.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Klein_Report.pdf"">From Russia with Love</A>” study, and articles by investigative journalists like <STRONG><A href=""http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/the-hidden-persuaders-of-the-environmental-elite/article/2551714#!"">Ron Arnold</A></STRONG> and <STRONG>Lachlan Markay</STRONG> (<A href=""http://freebeacon.com/politics/how-dem-moneyman-nat-simons-profits-from-political-giving/"">here</A>, <A href=""http://freebeacon.com/national-security/liberal-foundation-distributed-money-from-bermuda-to-liberal-nonprofits/"">here</A>, and <A href=""http://freebeacon.com/issues/foreign-firm-funding-u-s-green-groups-tied-to-state-owned-russian-oil-company/"">here</A>) barely scratch the surface.</P><P>Washington is out of control. The IRS targeting conservative groups, Clinton Foundation and national security scandals, FBI pseudo-investigations and whitewashing, bureaucrats imposing $1.9 trillion in economy-crushing regulations that <A href=""https://info.mrc.org/COLLATERAL-DAMAGE.html"">ruin families and communities</A> – with virtually no perpetrators ever held accountable.</P><P>Here we are talking about radically and fundamentally dismantling the energy system that powers the American free enterprise, transportation, communication, and healthcare systems … replacing it with expensive, subsidized, unreliable, land-hungry wind, solar, and biofuel energy – and using vindictive government power to bankrupt and impoverish disfavored factions, while enriching favored allies.</P><P>Imagine the trillions of dollars required for the U.S. to accept the wind industry’s “vision” of 4,000,000 megawatts of electricity from <A href=""https://www.cfact.org/2016/10/21/cfact-comments-to-the-department-of-energy-on-ice-breaker-lake-erie-wind-project/"">500,000 to 1,250,000 mega-turbines</A> in our Great Lakes and along our Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico coasts. Picture the multiple trillions required to achieve <A href=""http://townhall.com/columnists/pauldriessen/2016/10/01/green-pixie-dust-energy-policies-n2226185"">50% renewable energy by 2027</A> and a “100% <mark>carbon</mark>-free economy” by 2050. Envision the potential billionaire profits!</P><P>As the investigators reveal, the billionaires’ green network transfers millions of dollars from individual, corporate, and “charitable foundation” donors … through tax-exempt “educational” nonprofits that do not have to disclose donor names … to activist and pressure groups that work to influence elections, legislation, regulations, legal actions and public perceptions on energy and environmental issues. A lot of money originates with Russian and other foreign interests that want to protect their monopoly revenues.</P><P>Many wealthy donors and foundations that bankroll these operations also have venture capital firms that invest in “green” energy companies which benefit from the laws, policies, regulations and lawsuits – and from government contracts, grants, guaranteed loans, subsidies, feed-in tariffs, and mandates for energy systems, ethanol blends or wind and solar electricity. In turn, U.S. money can end up in the coffers of radical <A href=""http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/foreign-funding-for-adani-lawsuits/news-story/d7179b0bbdfa5967d7ffd292c75b3f6e"">Australian groups</A> that block coal exports to India, thereby keeping its people mired in poverty.</P><P>Coal billionaire/<mark>climate</mark> activist <STRONG><A href=""http://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2016/10/tom-steyer-pursuing-racial-and-economic-justice-issues-invested-heavily-in-for-profit-prisons-106634"">Tom Steyer</A></STRONG> and other club members invest in for-profit prisons where <A href=""http://freebeacon.com/issues/prison-labor-helps-solar-firm-backed-by-dem-donor-undercut-competition/"">inmates make</A> ultra-low-cost solar panels. <STRONG><A href=""http://www.investors.com/politics/viewpoint/russians-paying-to-kill-us-sandpiper-pipeline/"">Warren Buffett</A></STRONG> funneled millions through his family foundation to the secretive Tides Foundation to pressure groups campaigning against the Keystone and Sandpiper Pipelines, thereby benefiting his railroad and tank car companies that haul oil. Others support North Dakota pipeline protesters who <A href=""http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/25/obama-steers-clear-as-dakota-access-pipeline-prote/"">destroyed equipment</A>, mutilated cattle and harassed local residents.</P><P>One of the most clandestine, devious arrangements involves firms owned or controlled by Nathaniel Simons and Laura Baxter-Simons. Tax records reveal that their Sea Change Foundation gives tens of millions a year to the Natural Resources Defense Council, Food and Water Watch, U.S. <A href=""https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/the-<mark>climate</mark>-action-network-funding-<mark>climate</mark>-alarmist-stunts-around-the-world""><mark>Climate</mark> Action Network</A>, League of Conservation Voters, Center for American Progress, White House counselor <STRONG>John Podesta</STRONG>’s Progressive Policy Institute – and the Sierra Club, which received millions from Sea Change for its “Beyond Natural Gas” campaign, to battle drilling, fracking, pipelines, and hydro<mark>carbon</mark> use.</P><P>The Simons regularly give millions to Sea Change. Other donors include the Gates Foundation, eBay’s Omidyar Network Fund, <STRONG>David Rockefeller</STRONG>’s personal foundation, and the Walmart Foundation. Sea Change also gets money from hedge funds incorporated in Bermuda and headed by Simons’ father <STRONG>Jim Simons</STRONG>, a major Democratic donor whose net worth is over $12 billion.</P><P>But much of Sea Change’s funding comes through Bermuda-based Klein, Ltd., whose sole purpose is to channel money covertly to Sea Change and thence to environmental advocacy and “educational” groups. Klein is a shell company that exists only on paper. Its only officers are employees of Bermuda law firm Wakefield Quin, its address is the same as WQ’s, and its registered business agents work for Wakefield.</P><P>A sizable portion of Klein’s funds come from the IPOC Group, an international growth fund owned by Russian minister of telecommunications and Putin friend <STRONG>Leonid Reiman</STRONG>; Spectrum Partners, a Moscow-based energy investment firm with major assets in Russian oil and gas; <mark>Rosneft</mark>, the Russian-government-owned oil and gas giant that is one of Wakefield’s largest clients; and other Russian companies.</P><P>Their motives are easy to discern. U.S. fracking has battered Russia’s income, economy, and ruble. One way to reverse this is to support groups that oppose drilling, fracking, and pipelines – and support wind, solar, and biofuel projects that Simons views as the foundation of a future “low-<mark>carbon</mark> U.S. economy.”</P><P>That’s why <A href=""http://townhall.com/columnists/maritanoon/2016/10/17/wikileaks-hillarys-conflicted-comments-on-fracking-n2233435""><STRONG>Hillary Clinton</STRONG> told German bankers</A> in 2013 that U.S. energy development is “up against” Russian “oligarchs” who are funding “phony environmental groups.” She supports fracking, she claimed, while publicly saying her regulations won’t leave many places where the practice will be tolerated.</P><P>Nat Simons also runs venture capital firms Elan Management and its offshoot Prelude Ventures, which invest in “green energy” companies that benefit from policies that his Sea Change operations promote. At least seven companies in Prelude’s portfolio (including prison-labor solar company Suniva) have received bounteous federal funding from the Energy, Defense, Agriculture and Justice Departments, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies. Many WQ clients have ties to the Russian government.</P><P>Klein, Ltd., director and Wakefield Quin senior counsel <STRONG>Nicholas Hoskins</STRONG> is also a director in the IPOC Group and vice president of a London-based investment firm whose president is a member of Putin’s inner circle and used to chair the board of Russia-owned oil company <mark>Rosneft</mark>. He also serves as director of a holding company with extensive shares in an oil company owned by Russian billionaire <STRONG>Alexander Lebedev </STRONG>(photo)<STRONG>.</STRONG></P><P>WQ senior counsel <STRONG>Roderick Forrest</STRONG> operates Medallion Investments and Meritage Investments, hedge funds owned by Nat Simons. Forrest and Hoskins are also tied closely to Spectrum Partners and Marcuard-Spectrum, Moscow-based firms with significant assets in Russian oil and gas.</P><P>All these subterranean networks and connections came to light thanks to tax records and the sources cited earlier in this article. It’s no wonder the Senate report called Sea Change “shadowy” and its operations “a deceitful way to hide the source of millions of dollars … attempting to effect political change.”</P><P>On the personal front, Simons commutes to work across San Francisco Bay on the “Elan,” a 54-ft, 1,550-HP, gas-guzzling yacht – and manages his household staff and 6,700-square-foot home via Elan Household LLC. Laura Baxter-Simons fired their 9-month-pregnant housekeeper after she requested maternity leave. But their planet-focused ethical star shines bright in environmentalist skies.</P><P>On this Halloween eve, it is truly frightening to grasp the extent to which America’s politicians, policies, laws, regulations, energy, economy, jobs, and future are controlled by a cabal of stealthy billionaires – who receive billions from state and federal government agencies, and use those riches to become even wealthier, more powerful, and more in control of our lives, livelihoods, living standards, and liberties.</P></DIV><DIV class=""meta entry-terms clearfix""><DIV class=""entry-categories""><H6>Categories</H6></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

As a result, Russian oil production has hit a post-Soviet record high. <A href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=28432"">Article courtesy of US EIA</A>.</EM></P><P>Russia’s two main hydro<mark>carbon</mark> taxes are calculated by formulas that result in lower tax rates at lower crude oil prices. As oil prices fall, petroleum companies retain a larger share of revenue, but government revenues from oil and natural gas production fall even faster than prices.</P><P>In 2015, the Brent crude oil price, measured in U.S. dollars per barrel, declined by 47% versus 2014, and the price for the first half of 2016 is down an additional 31% versus the first half of 2015. Because of changes in the exchange rate, the decline in the Brent price as measured in Russian rubles is not as dramatic: a 16% decline from 2014 to 2015, and an additional 16% from the first half of 2015 to the first half of 2016. Over the same periods, Russian federal budget revenues from oil and natural gas fell by 21% and 29%, respectively.</P><P>However, many Russian petroleum companies have, in ruble terms, increased investment or seen only modest declines in investment over the same period.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><EM><STRONG>Ccontinued high investment levels at <mark>Rosneft</mark>, Lukoil, and other Russian oil and natural gas companies, and slower production declines at old fields all have helped push oil production to record post-Soviet levels</STRONG></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>State-owned <mark>Rosneft</mark> and independent Lukoil are Russia’s two largest oil producers. Together, the two companies account for about half of Russia’s roughly 11 million barrels per day oil production. While oil prices and government revenues declined in 2015, <mark>Rosneft</mark> increased its capital expenditure on exploration and production for projects in Russia by 30% compared with 2014.</P><P><mark>Rosneft</mark>’s exploration and production capital expenditure in the first half of 2016 was 33% higher than in the first half of 2015. In comparison, Lukoil’s spending on exploration and production for projects in Russia declined 11% in 2015 versus 2014, and expenditures in the first half of 2016 were 2% lower than in the first half of 2015.</P><P>The favorable tax structure and exchange rate for Russian oil companies, the subsequent continued high investment levels at <mark>Rosneft</mark>, Lukoil, and other Russian oil and natural gas companies, and slower production declines at old fields all have helped push oil production to record post-Soviet levels. Considerable investment has also been made in many new fields that have recently started up or are due to start in the near future.</P><P>The Russian government has implemented or proposed various measures to increase revenues that could affect companies’ future investment plans. The government has changed the two main hydro<mark>carbon</mark> taxes (minerals extraction tax and export tax) several times in recent years. The most recent changes and proposals for upcoming changes all tend to raise the taxes paid by oil and gas companies.</P><P>In January 2015, the Russian government announced its intention to sell some of its shares in several Russian companies, including Bashneft and <mark>Rosneft</mark>. Bashneft was one of Russia’s 10 largest oil producers. On October 12, 2016, the federal government <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-forum-<mark>rosneft</mark>-bashneft-idUSKCN12C2DA"">sold its 50.08% controlling stake in Bashneft</A> to <mark>Rosneft</mark>, Russia’s largest oil producer, for $5.3 billion. The Russian government currently owns 69.5% of <mark>Rosneft</mark>. It also intends to sell up to 19.5% of <mark>Rosneft</mark>, retaining a controlling interest.</P><P>In addition to taxes, the government also collects dividends from oil and gas companies in which the state is a shareholder. In April 2016, the Russian government directed state-controlled companies to pay 50% of 2015 net income out as dividends, nearly double the dividends companies would normally pay. Oil companies have objected to the tax and dividend increases, arguing they divert money from capital investment programs.</P><P>For more information on Russia’s energy industry, see EIA’s <A href=""http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis.cfm?iso=RUS"">Country Analysis Brief on Russia</A>.</P><P><STRONG>Editor</STRONG><STRONG>’</STRONG><STRONG>s Note</STRONG></P><P><EM>This article was first published <A href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=28432"">on the website of the US EIA</A> and is republished here with permission.

Since the turn of the century, Tillerson has expanded ExxonMobil’s presence in Russia’s near-Arctic through partnership with <mark>Rosneft</mark>. In particular, Exxon and <mark>Rosneft</mark> jointly co-own Exxon Neftegaz Ltd and its oil and natural gas operations in Sakhalin (Japan’s SODECO and India’s ONGC are</SPAN><A href=""http://www.sakhalin-1.com/Sakhalin/Russia-English/Upstream/about_consortium.aspx"">also co-owners</A><SPAN style=""color: #000000;"">).

In 2013, the partnership was expanded to several more blocks across the Russian Arctic, but further cooperation was derailed by western sanctions imposed in the summer of 2014, after the Russian invasion of Crimea. Although ExxonMobil tried to</SPAN><A href=""http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0809/Despite-sanctions-ExxonMobil-XOM-starts-drilling-in-Russia.-Putin-cheers"">push ahead</A><SPAN style=""color: #000000;"">despite sanctions, by the end of the year they were forced to put their work in Russia’s Arctic</SPAN><A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-01/exxon-<mark>rosneft</mark>-scrap-arctic-contracts-as-russia-sanctions-bite"">on hiatus</A>.</P><P><SPAN style=""color: #000000;"">Concerns have been raised about Tillerson’s nomination because of his friendly ties to Russia, including a 2013 award – the</SPAN><A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/13/what-is-the-russian-order-of-friendship-and-why-does-trumps-pick-for-secretary-of-state-have-one/?utm_term=.141aca78f3ba"">Russia’s Order of Friendship</A><SPAN style=""color: #000000;"">. Rex Tillerson has also</SPAN><A href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rex-tillerson-is-no-fan-of-russia-sanctions/"">vocally opposed</A><SPAN style=""color: #000000;"">the US sanctions on Russia, criticising US policy toward Russia. As an employee and CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson understandably prioritised the interests of his shareholders, and presumably, he will prioritise the interests of his administration and the American public as Secretary of State. In addition, under conflict of interest laws, Tillerson would be</SPAN><A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/12/13/trump-and-tillerson-an-ethical-pigpen/?utm_term=.514c2a7f97d7"">forced to divest himself</A><SPAN style=""color: #000000;"">of his shares in ExxonMobil and manage his wealth through a blind trust. However, even without financial ties to the energy industry as motivation, it is likely that his experiences working in the energy industry and cooperating with Russians will colour his views on how to best serve America’s interest in regard to Russia, sanctions, and other elements.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""color: #000000;"">How will Rex Tillerson’s views on America’s interests impact the Arctic? The most obvious result will be either ending sanctions against Russia, or at least restructuring how they operate.

But the bigger question is how far the Trump Administration will go to subsidise Arctic activity over safer investments elsewhere.

While China will loan <mark>Rosneft</mark> $2 billion backed by 25 years of oil supply, <mark>Rosneft</mark> will boost oil exports to China by 800,000 metric tons this year.

A total of 21,000 meter of seismic studies have been conducted in the period and as many as 114 prospective structures identified. The preliminary resource estimates for the Khatanga license area amount to 9,5 billion tons of oil equivalents, Sechin told to the President.</P><H6>Difficult access</H6><P>During summer 2016, two ice-class ships loaded with more than 8,000 tons of equipment and technology, including the drilling rig, made it from Arkhangelsk to the remote Khatanga Bay.</P><P>The drilling will be conducted horizontally from the shore on depths down to 5,000 meters.</P><P>«This will significantly reduce financial resources and provide economic efficiency and high ecological standards», <A href=""https://www.<mark>rosneft</mark>.ru/press/releases/item/186075/"" target=""_blank""><mark>Rosneft</mark> says in a press release</A>. «The company is today among the world leaders in the development of offshore fields», it adds with confidence.</P><P>The drilling comes after <mark>Rosneft</mark> in August 2016 <A href=""https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/arctic-industry/2016/08/<mark>rosneft</mark>-builds-base-laptev-sea-coast"" target=""_blank"">opened a research base in the area</A>. The base was developed as «a research outpost for development and testing of new technology, technical equipment and materials».</P><P>The Gulf of Khatanga is among the least accessible places in the Russian Arctic. Located east of the Taymyr Peninsula by the ice-covered Laptev Sea, the license area is open for regular shipping only two months in the year. The nearest settlement is Khatanga, a town with a population of about 2,500 located about 350 km to the southwest.</P><H6>Putin’s interest in Arctic oil and gas</H6><P>«It is still a long way to go before exploitation, but what we are doing is actually to start the development of a new oil and gas province, which, even with preliminary estimates, holds enormous resources», Putin underlined in the televised meeting.</P><P>The drilling of the well comes as Putin puts the Arctic on top of his agenda. Last week, he <A href=""https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/arctic/2017/03/medvedev-franz-josef-land"" target=""_blank"">first visited the Franz Josef Land</A> and subsequently took part in the Arctic Forum, the grand event in Arkhangelsk.</P><P>In a <A href=""http://www.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/54147"" target=""_blank"">meeting held during the visit to Franz Josef Land,</A> and in the premises of the Russian Arctic National Park, Putin highlighted not environment and <mark>climate change</mark>, but the major oil and gas potential of the region.</P><P>The Russian Arctic zone includes energy resources worth up to $20 trillion, he maintained and said that the country’s production on the shelf by year 2030 will amount to 2,2 million barrels per day.</P><P>The Laptev Sea is one of several regions of attention. In 2014, <mark>Rosneft</mark> together with ExxonMobil made a major discovery in the Pobeda well in the Kara Sea.</P><P>In 2018, the turn will  come for the Barents Sea, <mark>Rosneft</mark> says.

Later, he asserted his country’s claim to the oil underneath it. “Natural resources, which are of paramount importance for the Russian economy, are concentrated in this region,” <A href=""https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/03/vladimir-putin-visits-arctic-reaffirm-russia-claim-170329200545418.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">he said</A> in remarks to Russian state media. W<SPAN>ithout</SPAN><SPAN> supporting evidence, Putin claimed that</SPAN><SPAN> $30 trillion worth of black gold lay beneath his country’s portion of the Arctic. Oil companies from other countries would be welcome to help extract these reserves, he said, but they would be extracted one way or another. And the riches would flow to Russia.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Easier said than done. Putin has long dreamed of reaping profits from Arctic oil. But sanctions, low oil prices, and the weather have proven significant obstacles. Now, with Donald Trump as president, Putin faces yet another potential speed bump—one he didn’t face when Barack Obama was in the White House. He has to compete with the United States for business in the polar region. </SPAN></P><P>Over the last month, Trump has moved to open more of the U.S. Arctic to oil development. On Friday, he took the first step of “an aggressive effort to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, one of the country’s most pristine and environmentally sensitive areas,” <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/04/19/trump-just-took-the-first-step-of-an-aggressive-effort-to-drill-in-the-arctic/?utm_term=.ccf7864b0b0f"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">according to</A><I>The Washington Post</I>. The 19 million-acre portion of Alaskan coast had been off-limits to oil developers since 1980, when Congress designated it as protected wilderness. But that changed in December, when Congress passed a tax bill that included a provision allowing drilling in<SPAN> ANWR’s coastal plain.</SPAN><SPAN> Now, Trump has started the process of leasing that plain to oil and gas companies. He plans to formally </SPAN><SPAN>issue leases as soon as next year.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>This alone wouldn’t be problematic for Russia; there’s enough oil to go around. But at the same time Trump has been making it easier for oil companies to develop in the U.S. Arctic, he’s making it harder for them to develop in Russia’s portion. In early April, he placed </SPAN><A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/us/politics/trump-sanctions-russia-putin-oligarchs.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">tough new sanctions</A><SPAN>on Russia that targeted some of the country’s richest men—many of them oil executives. Under the terms of the sanctions, American companies cannot conduct business with those men or their companies. </SPAN></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""article-text-wrap""><DIV class=""article-text-grid""><P>More important, Trump’s sanctions make Western oil companies broadly wary to invest in Russia, said Victoria Herrmann, president of the The Arctic Institute, a think tank. The Obama administration and the European Union had already placed sanctions on Russia in 2014 that <A href=""http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/targeting-russia-s-oil-why-sanctions-will-ultimately-work"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">prohibited the country’s use of drilling equipment</A> and technology from America and Europe. “These new sanctions are an indication that the general relationship [between Russia and the U.S.] is not going to improve in the coming years,” Herrmann said. “And you don’t want to invest in something that’s uncertain, because oil takes a long time to extract and sell.” </P><P>Oil companies are already leaving Russia as a result of the sanctions. In February, ExxonMobil announced it was leaving a valuable venture with <mark>Rosneft</mark>, Russia’s largest oil company, to drill millions of acres on and offshore in Russia’s Arctic. This was a huge blow to Putin, who had “personally blessed the arrangement, which envisioned decades of exploration in some of Russia’s richest, untouched fields,” according to <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-28/exxon-quitting-russian-oil-ventures-frozen-by-u-s-eu-sanctions"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Bloomberg</A>. ExxonMobil cited sanctions as the reason for its withdrawal.</P><P>Those companies leaving Russia are also seeing new opportunity in America—specifically the <SPAN>Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</SPAN><SPAN>, </SPAN><SPAN>Herrmann said</SPAN><SPAN>. “The opening of ANWR has definitely changed the conversation, and changed where companies are pursuing business,” she said. “With an administration that’s not just pro-oil, but pro-oil in Alaska specifically, you have a revitalization of companies that didn’t see the appeal now being quite eager.”</SPAN></P><P>These aren’t the makings of a brewing oil war between Russia and America, though. Neither the opening of ANWR or Russian sanctions were done with the explicit purpose of gaining a <SPAN>competitive edge</SPAN><SPAN> in the Arctic oil race. Trump opened ANWR to appease fossil fuel interests and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski. He sanctioned Russia for </SPAN><A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/us/politics/trump-sanctions-russia-putin-oligarchs.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">interfering in the 2016 election</A><SPAN>.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>But the notion that such a race exists could benefit Putin. Arctic oil extraction is important to Russia’s economy and its self-image. So sanctions or not, Russia will </SPAN><SPAN>continue to </SPAN><SPAN>aggressively pursue it:</SPAN><SPAN> The country announced on Monday that it will begin active offshore drilling in the Arctic </SPAN><A href=""http://tass.com/economy/1001275"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">next year</A><SPAN>.</SPAN><SPAN>“State media can now</SPAN><SPAN>showcase how strong Russia is in the face of the Untied States,” Herrmann said. “</SPAN><SPAN>Despite the sanctions, despite Exxon pulling out, Russian oil hasn’t stopped. It’s hit a speed bump, but they’re still opening up new fields.”</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""article-text-wrap""><DIV class=""article-text-grid""><P>Unlike Russia, though, America doesn’t need the oil from its Arctic territory to sustain its economy. So luring oil companies to Alaska only comes at the expense of one of America’s most wild, pristine environments—and may further contribute to <mark>climate change</mark>. “The United States can develop in ANWR and Russia can simultaneously do the same there; this isn’t a zero sum game,” Herrmann said. “The likely outcome here is that Russia and the U.S. both ramp up oil.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER class=""article-footer-wrap"" data-reactid="".1tyiefpdl1m.2.1.0.0.$0.2""><DIV class=""article-author-bio"" data-reactid="".1tyiefpdl1m.2.1.0.0.$0.2.0:$0""><DIV class=""bio-body"" data-reactid="".1tyiefpdl1m.2.1.0.0.$0.2.0:$0.0""><DIV class=""bio-text"" data-reactid="".1tyiefpdl1m.2.1.0.0.$0.2.0:$0.0.0""><P>Emily Atkin is a staff writer at <I>The New Republic</I>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

He is also senior counsel at the Bermudan law firm Wakefield Quin and the vice president of a London-based investment firm whose president until recently chaired the board of the state-owned Russian oil company <mark>Rosneft</mark>.</P><P>In addition to those roles, Hoskins is a director at a company called Klein Ltd. No one knows where that firm’s money comes from. Its only publicly documented activities have been transfers of $23 million to U.S. environmentalist groups that push policies that would hamstring surging American oil and gas production, which has hurt Russia’s energy-reliant economy.</P><P>With oil prices plunging as a result of a fracking-induced oil glut in the United States, experts say the links between Russian oil interests, secretive foreign political donors, and high-profile American environmentalists suggest Russia may be backing anti-fracking efforts in the United States.</P><P>The interest of Russian oil companies and American environmentalist financiers intersect at a Bermuda-based law firm called Wakefield Quin. The firm acts as a corporate registered agent, providing office space for clients, and, for some, &quot;managing the day to day affairs,&quot; according to its website.</P><P>As many as 20 companies and investment funds with ties to the Russian government are Wakefield Quin clients. Many list the firm’s address on official documentation.</P><P>Klein Ltd. also shares that address. Documents filed with Bermuda’s registrar of companies list just two individuals associated with the company: Hoskins, Wakefield Quin senior counsel and managing director, and Marlies Smith, a corporate administrator at the firm.</P><P>According to documents filed with Bermuda’s registrar of companies, Klein Ltd. was incorporated in March 2011 &quot;exclusively for philanthropic purposes,&quot; meaning &quot;no part of the net earnings … inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.&quot;</P><P>&quot;The company does not propose to carry on business in Bermuda,&quot; the documents stated.</P><P>The only publicly available documentation of any business conducted by Klein Ltd. were two Internal Revenue Service filings by the California-based Sea Change Foundation, which showed that Klein had contributed $23 million to the group in <A href=""http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990pf_pdf_archive/204/204952986/204952986_201107_990PF.pdf?_ga=1.16971577.1015383331.1422285311"" target=""_blank"">2010</A> and <A href=""http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990pf_pdf_archive/204/204952986/204952986_201207_990PF.pdf?_ga=1.16971577.1015383331.1422285311"" target=""_blank"">2011</A>. Klein Ltd. was responsible for more than 40 percent of contributions to Sea Change during those years.</P><P>The foundation passed those millions along to some of the nation’s most prominent and politically active environmentalist groups. The Sierra Club, the Natural Resource Defense Council, the League of Conservation Voters, and the Center for American Progress were among the recipients of Sea Change’s $100 million in grants in 2010 and 2011.</P><P>Neither Wakefield Quin nor Sea Change responded to multiple requests for more information about their relationships with Klein Ltd.</P><P>&quot;None of this foreign corporation’s funding is disclosed in any way,&quot; the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee wrote of the company in a <A href=""http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&amp;FileStore_id=8af3d005-1337-4bc3-bcd6-be947c523439"" target=""_blank"">report</A> last year. &quot;This is clearly a deceitful way to hide the source of millions of dollars that are active in our system, attempting to effect political change.&quot;</P><P>The Sierra Club, which received nearly $8.5 million from Sea Change in 2010 and 2011, launched its &quot;Beyond Natural Gas&quot; campaign the following year. The effort has become one of the largest and best-funded environmentalist campaigns combating fracking and the extraction of natural gas in general.</P><P>Sea Change’s &quot;skeletal staff quietly shovels tens of millions of dollars out the door annually to combat <mark>climate change</mark>. And that's pretty much all it does,&quot; <A href=""http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2014/12/31/philanthropy-awards-2014.html"" target=""_blank"">noted</A> Inside Philanthropy, which awarded the foundation its &quot;sharpest laser focus in grantmaking&quot; award last year.</P><P>Nathaniel Simons and his wife run the foundation and are, except for Klein Ltd., its only donors. Simons, a hedge fund millionaire who <A href=""freebeacon.com:politics:dem-mega-donor-commutes-to-work-on-gas-guzzling-yacht"" target=""_blank"">commutes</A> to work across San Francisco Bay aboard a 50-foot yacht, also runs a venture capital firm that <A href=""http://freebeacon.com/politics/how-dem-moneyman-nat-simons-profits-from-political-giving/"" target=""_blank"">invests in companies</A> that benefit from environmental and energy policies that Sea Change grantees promote.</P><P>Simons himself has ties to Klein Ltd. Several Wakefield Quin attorneys are listed as directors of hedge funds that his firm manages, and in which Sea Change has assets.</P><P>Senior counsel Rod Forrest was <A href=""http://freebeacon.com/national-security/liberal-foundation-distributed-money-from-bermuda-to-liberal-nonprofits/"" target=""_blank"">listed</A> on documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a director of two investment funds, Medallion International Ltd. and Meritage Holdings Ltd., in which Sea Change had tens of millions invested while it received money from Klein Ltd.</P><P>Simons’ company runs the Meritage Fund. The Medallion Fund is run by Renaissance Technologies, the hedge fund management firm run by his father, billionaire and Democratic mega-donor Jim Simons. Both funds listed Wakefield Quin’s Hamilton, Bermuda, address on SEC filings.</P><P>Wakefield Quin’s Hoskins and Smith, as well as a number of other employees of Wakefield Quin, have worked in some capacity for companies or investment funds owned by or tied to Russian state-owned corporations and high-level officials in the country.</P><P>Hoskins, Forrest, and another Wakefield employee named Penny Cornell were all <A href=""http://www.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=958219654&amp;page_id=6579606530&amp;page_url=//www.spectrumfunds.com/Page/Directors-Officers&amp;page_last_updated=2013-06-24T05:18:13"" target=""_blank"">listed</A> as executives of Spectrum Partners Ltd., a fund with <A href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20131206230000/http://spectrumfunds.com/Page/Contacts"" target=""_blank"">offices</A> in Moscow, Cypress, and Bermuda, Cornell at the address of Wakefield Quin’s offices.</P><P>According to a performance <A href=""http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/spectrum-report.jpeg"" target=""_blank"">report </A>for one of Spectrum Partners’ funds, its portfolio consisted of &quot;Russian and CIS [former Soviet state] securities and securities outside of Russia or CIS but having significant economic or business involvement with Russia and/or CIS.&quot;</P><P>As of 2008, more than half of the fund’s holdings were in the oil and gas sectors.</P><P>Numerous executives at Wakefield Quin have ties to Russian oil and gas companies, including <mark>Rosneft</mark>, which is majority-owned by the Russian government and in 2013 became the largest oil company in the world.</P><P>Hoskins is the vice president of a London-based company called Marcuard Services Limited, and a member of the firm’s board, according to its website.</P><P>The company’s president, and the chairman of its parent company, Bermuda-based Marcuard Holding Limited, is Hans-Joerg Rudloff. Rudloff is also a former <A href=""http://marcuardheritage.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hansjoerg_Rudloff_2014.pdf"" target=""_blank"">vice-chairman</A> of the <mark>Rosneft</mark>’s board.</P><P>Hoskins is also a <A href=""http://www.isda.org/smallbang/sbpdf/TroikaDialogBermudaLtd101309.pdf"" target=""_blank"">director</A> at a Bermuda-based subsidiary of Russian investment bank Troika Dialog. That firm organized an initial public offering for Timan Oil &amp; Gas, which is run by Russian oligarch Alexander Lebedev.</P><P>The Environmental Policy Alliance, which provided the <EM>Washington Free Beacon</EM> with a <A href=""http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/epa-report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">copy</A> of an upcoming report on Klein Ltd.’s Kremlin ties, said Wakefield Quin’s ties to environmental financiers and Russian oil barons merit closer scrutiny.</P><P>&quot;The American public deserves to know whether environmentalists are attacking US energy companies at the behest of a Russian government that would like nothing more than to see their international competition weakened,&quot; Will Coggin, a senior research analyst at the EPA, said in an emailed statement.</P><P>&quot;In the face of mounting evidence, environmental groups are going to have to start answering hard questions about their international funding sources,&quot; Coggin said.</P><P>The overlap between executives at firms with ties to Russian oil interests and a multi-million-dollar donor to U.S. environmentalist groups has some experts worried that Russians may be replicating anti-fracking tactics used in Europe to attack the practice in the United States.</P><P>&quot;I have met allies who can report that Russia, as part of their sophisticated information and disinformation operations, engaged actively with so-called non-governmental organizations—environmental organizations working against shale gas—to maintain European dependence on imported Russian gas,&quot; Anders Fogh Rasmussen, formerly NATO’s secretary general, <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/19/russia-secretly-working-with-environmentalists-to-oppose-fracking"" target=""_blank"">said</A> last year.</P><P>It is unlikely that the Kremlin is directly involved in doing so in the United States, according to Ron Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise.</P><P>&quot;If anybody in Russia is behind all the secretive Bermuda investment house and law firm action, it’s most likely some oligarch bidding against U.S. competition,&quot; he said in an email.</P><P>Arnold, the author of <EM>Undue Influence: Wealthy Foundations, Grant Driven Environmental Groups, and Zealous Bureaucrats That Control Your Future</EM>, said that the opacity of Klein Ltd.’s involvement with the Sea Change Foundation exemplifies attempts to shield the source of donations to such groups.</P><P>&quot;In my experience of trying to penetrate offshore money funnels for U.S. leftist foundations and green groups, I have found that Liechtenstein, Panama and Bermuda are the Big Three green equivalents of the Cayman Islands for hedge fund managers—totally opaque and impervious to my specially designed research tools,&quot; Arnold said.</P><P><STRONG>Update April 27, 2017 9:08 a.m.:</STRONG> A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Food and Water Watch as a recipient of Sea Change grants.</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

But one important player is still missing. Russia, the world’s <A href=""http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/news_docs/jrc-2015-trends-in-global-<mark>co2</mark>-emissions-2015-report-98184.pdf"">fifth-largest greenhouse gas emitter</A> is unlikely to ratify by the end of the year. </P><P>Following a special <mark>climate</mark> event at the 2016 United Nations General Assembly, Alexander Bedtritsky, special adviser on <mark>climate</mark> to Vladimir Putin, <A href=""http://tass.ru/obschestvo/3639933"">confirmed that</A> “Russia will not artificially speed up the ratification process”. </P><FIGURE class=""align-right ""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">Singapore’s Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon at the Paris agreement ratification ceremony.</SPAN><SPAN class=""attribution""><SPAN class=""source"">Mike Segar/Reuters</SPAN></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Russian representatives have said they need more time to evaluate the effects of the Paris agreement on the Russian economy, which is <A href=""https://theconversation.com/russia-a-global-energy-powerhouse-thats-much-more-than-a-petro-state-57766"">heavily dependent on fossil fuels</A>. The government wants to <A href=""http://kommersant.ru/Doc/2951538"">draft a low-<mark>carbon</mark> development strategy</A> before deciding to ratify.</P><P>So far, the plan is to work out an analysis of the socio-economic effects of the <A href=""http://kommersant.ru/Doc/2951538"">ratification by mid-December</A>, and to later draft a strategy for low-<mark>carbon</mark> development. No certain deadline for ratification, which is due to take place by passing a corresponding legal act within Russia, has been set. </P><H2>The great <mark>climate</mark> debate</H2><P>Why is Russia dragging its feet? One reason is the fact that opinions on the merits of the Paris agreement are split within the country. Most senior officials and federal ministries support the treaty and informally speak in favor of quicker ratification. But opposition comes mainly from large private businesses, predominantly from the coal and steel sectors.</P><P>The companies, whose extracting and processing facilities are largely located in <A href=""http://kommersant.ru/doc/3037549"">Siberia</A>, claim that quick ratification, and the introduction of any kind of <mark>carbon</mark> price within Russia will cause serious socio-economic damage. This will affect vulnerable groups employed in the coal industry the most, they say. </P><P>These companies have secured support among powerful business lobby groups,  <A href=""http://kommersant.ru/doc/3042039"">think-tanks and research institutes</A>. Together, these groups run anti-Paris agreement campaigns, including one on the “<A href=""http://www.right4coal.ru"">right to coal</A>”, in some of Russia’s resource-rich regions. Meanwhile, authors of <A href=""http://kommersant.ru/doc/3042039"">privately sponsored research papers</A> argue that the Russian economy will suffer severe losses after the agreement enters into force.</P><P>Most oil and gas majors, however, are keeping quiet, neither objecting nor openly supporting the new <mark>climate</mark> treaty. Representatives of the Russian gas giant Gazprom often talk about importance of <A href=""http://www.gazprom.com/nature/kioto/%20or%20http://kommersant.ru/doc/2984626"">switching to natural gas</A> to bring down greenhouse gas emissions, but rarely speak openly about the importance of the Paris agreement.</P><P>There are a number of pro-<mark>climate</mark> stakeholders, however. These include officials from federal ministries, think tanks and NGOs, as well as certain businesses, all of whom argue vocally for ratification. </P><P>Shortly before the Paris <mark>climate</mark> summit in December 2015, a number of Russian companies launched the <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>partners.ru/"">Russian Partnership for <mark>Climate</mark> Protection</A>, including high-tech state-owned enterprise Rusnano, state-owned hydro-energy company Rushydro, state-owned banks Sberbank and Vneshtorgbank, private bank Alfabank, and a group of aluminium companies, Rusal. </P><P>Oleg Deripaska, the owner of Rusal and one of Russia’s richest oligarchs, has been quoted in the <A href=""https://www.ft.com/content/34c3a69e-9d02-11e5-b45d-4812f209f861"">international media</A> calling for a global price on <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>According to a <A href=""https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/001/132/original/CDP_<mark>Carbon</mark>_Price_report_2016.pdf?1474453251"">recent report</A>, three Russian companies have already embedded a <mark>carbon</mark> price into their business strategy.</P><FIGURE class=""align-center ""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">Vladimir Putin and Oleg Deripaska at APEC in 2014.</SPAN><SPAN class=""attribution""><SPAN class=""source"">Wang Zhao/Reuters</SPAN></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H2>Bad economic <mark>climate</mark></H2><P>There are other significant barriers to <mark>climate</mark> progress. The perception prevails that Russia can’t allow itself an ambitious domestic <mark>climate policy</mark> for economic reasons – namely, the lack of funding for emission reduction and energy efficiency measures. </P><P>Speaking at a recent joint China-Russia group meeting on <mark>climate change</mark>, a high-level official with the Ministry of Economic Development said that the core activities in <mark>carbon</mark> regulation in Russia should be concentrated around energy efficiency. This requires an <A href=""http://kommersant.ru/doc/3096251"">annual investment</A> of no less than €6 billion. </P><P>Energy efficiency was high on the Russian agenda from 2009-2011. But following the imposition of <A href=""https://europa.eu/newsroom/highlights/special-coverage/eu_sanctions_en"">international sanctions</A> over the conflict in Ukraine, the issue has been dropped.

Scientists had already been warning that a runaway greenhouse effect could disrupt Earth’s <mark>climate</mark> system to a point of no return. <mark>Climate change</mark> impacts continued to worsen in regions across the globe, and few communities were sufficiently prepared for these impacts. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil was investing its massive $45 billion in earnings in maximizing extraction and processing of oil and gas, including the controversial use of hydrofracturing (fracking) to extract fuel from tar sands and the expansion of offshore oil drilling. Despite pressure from shareholders to address <mark>climate change</mark> meaningfully, CEO Rex Tillerson stood his ground in suggesting that bringing fossil fuels to those who lack ready access (such as the <A href=""https://www.iea.org/topics/energypoverty/"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>1.2 billion people without electricity</STRONG></A>) was the “humanitarian” thing to do, rather than leading the transition away from an increasingly risky high-<mark>carbon</mark> energy future. By 2013, nine of the ten hottest years on record had occurred since the turn of the century, and growing instances of harmful <mark>climate</mark> impacts across the US and the world were impossible to ignore. Yet, these risks were readily discounted by corporate leadership at ExxonMobil.<STRONG>The Rising Stakes of Escalating Greenhouse Gas Emissions in 2013</STRONG>In the spring of 2013, the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii reported that the concentration of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere had exceeded 400 parts per million for the first time in human history; indeed, for the first time in millions of years. The last time levels were this high, Earth was in the middle of the Miocene period and there was almost no ice on the planet. A <A href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/05/130510-earth-<mark>co2</mark>-milestone-400-ppm"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>feature article</STRONG></A> in <EM>National Geographic</EM> puts things in perspective:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“The last time the concentration of Earth’s main greenhouse gas reached this mark, horses and camels lived in the high Arctic. Seas were at least 30 feet higher—at a level that today would inundate major cities around the world. The planet was about 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer. But the Earth then was in the final stage of a prolonged greenhouse epoch, and CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations were on their way down.”</P><P>According to <A href=""https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201313"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center</STRONG></A>, “2013 tied with 2003 as the fourth warmest year globally since records began in 1880.” The year 2013 also marked “the 37<SUP>th</SUP> consecutive year (since 1976) that the annual temperature was above the long-term average.” As of 2013, nine of the ten warmest years on record had occurred during the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century; only one year, 1998, was warmer than 2013. Global average temperatures were climbing steadily, at rate of about a third of a degree Fahrenheit since 1970. The previous year, 2012, was the hottest year on record in the lower 48 states. <EM>It is virtually impossible to believe that this corporation, with all of its scientific prowess, did not know this.</EM></P><P>In January 2013, the US Global Change Research Program released a draft of the third National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment, a comprehensive report of <mark>climate</mark> impacts being experienced in the United States — an assessment required by law to be conducted and published at least once every four years. As <A href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/national-<mark>climate</mark>-assessment-obama-best-chance-global-warming"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>reported</STRONG></A> by Chris Mooney at <EM>Mother Jones</EM> at the time (now a journalist at the <EM>Washington Post</EM>), the draft report warned unequivocally that unchecked greenhouse gas emissions would cause the global warming trend to “accelerate significantly,” bringing more heat waves and weather extremes, severe storms, rising seas, devastating floods, prolonged droughts, and more. The key takeaway quote was made by Ed Maibach, director of George Mason University’s Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Communication and a member of the federal advisory committee that released the assessment: “Data is accumulating to show that Americans want their politicians to take action.” Still, despite <A href=""https://www.c2es.org/federal/congress/113"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>a host of <mark>climate change</mark> bills</STRONG></A> introduced in both the House and the Senate in the 113<SUP>th</SUP> Congress, the passage of meaningful <mark>climate</mark> legislation was not yet in the cards, and is even less of a possibility today given the current political <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>The Underwhelming Response by Rex Tillerson and the Exxon Mobil Corporation</STRONG>Meanwhile, the ExxonMobil Corporation had taken in a whopping $45 billion in earnings in 2012. It expanded extraction using hydrofracturing in tar sands to increase activity in offshore oil drilling all over the world, thereby maximizing its rate of fossil fuel extraction and processing. <A href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exxonmobil-corporation-ceo-hosts-annual-221305776.html"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>Addressing shareholders</STRONG></A> at the company’s annual meeting on May 29, 2013, CEO Rex Tillerson bragged that 2012 earnings were the second highest in the history of the oil giant, and was crystal clear about corporate priorities:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“In 2012 we invested $39.8 billion in capital expenditures and total shareholder distributions were $30.1 billion. For the 19th consecutive year, we added more oil and natural gas reserves than we produced and our crude reserve replacement rate exceeded 100%. All of the above results reflect the hard work, diligence and dedication of the almost 77,000 men and women who work on ExxonMobil’s behalf the world over.”</P><P>Tillerson was aware of pressure from shareholders to address the <mark>climate</mark> threat more meaningfully than it had been doing. Pressure was even coming from heirs to the oil fortune, descendants of the company’s original founders. Jane Dale Owen, granddaughter of one of the founders of Humble Oil, the parent company of ExxonMobil, <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/how-will-exxonmobil-adapt-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change-crisis-it-helped-create-4b5047d16b8c"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>made a strong appeal</STRONG></A> to shareholders to put more pressure on corporate leadership to divert its resources to cleaner more renewable forms of energy. She wrote:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“As I cast my votes this year, I hope that more shareholders will get involved to move ExxonMobil toward a life-sustaining future. ExxonMobil’s $44.9 billion in earnings for 2012 came close to a world’s record. Instead of wildcatting in costly, unproven non-conventional fossil fuel technologies such as fracking and tar sands that add greenhouse gas to the atmosphere, the company could show foresight and leadership by investing in clean, renewable energy such as wind, solar and geothermal.”</P><P>But the shareholder resolution asking the company to set greenhouse gas and emissions reductions goals was defeated: even though it got a respectable share of the vote – 26.8% of voting shares supported the resolution – 73.2% voted against. Still, this sent a strong message to corporate leadership. Normally, when more than a quarter of shareholders demand an outcome, most corporate leaders make strong efforts to meet that outcome; Rex Tillerson was not among them. Instead, despite the growing certainty of <mark>climate</mark> science that was readily available and widely communicated to the public – most recently in the draft Fourth National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment – <A href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/exxonmobil-corporation-ceo-hosts-annual-221305776.html"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>he had this to say</STRONG></A>:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“If you examine the temperature record of the last decade, it really hadn’t changed. I know you will like to hear that as it don’t [sic] comport to some of the views of others, but last 10 years’ temperatures had been relatively flat.”</P><P>This statement is false and misleading, and is a classic example of one of the favorite tactics of <mark>climate change</mark> deniers: the use of short time periods to draw false conclusions about longer-term trends. As stated above, nine of the hottest ten years on record had occurred since 2000, and one of those ten occurred in 1998.</P><P>Moreover, instead of acknowledging the urgency of the problem and the growing certainty of the science, Tillerson brought out the tired claim that the science justifying action was not there yet: “[O]ur ability to understand all of the relationships between emissions and the environment and the feedback loops continues to be one of the science community’s grand challenges,” he said. Exaggerating scientific uncertainty around the <mark>climate change</mark> threat was one of the planned tactics of the oil industry’s Global <mark>Climate</mark> Coalition formed in the 1980s to push back against the Kyoto Protocol, and continued to be a recurrent theme at Exxon headquarters.</P><P>At the shareholders meeting, Tillerson pointed out that fossil energy raises the standard of living for people and asked, “What good is it to save the planet if humanity suffers in the process?” The irony of his statement was lost on him: those who were already suffering – and dying – ­from <mark>climate</mark> impacts (such as more extreme weather, intense flooding, prolonged droughts, and so on) evidently were not considered in Tillerson’s equation.</P><P>In a <A href=""http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/company/news-and-updates/speeches/a-business-perspective-on-global-energy-markets"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>speech</STRONG></A> delivered just days later, in June 2013, to the Asia Society, Tillerson reiterated the corporate “feel good” philosophy – the story company leaders apparently told themselves to justify the drill-baby-drill mentality:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“Approximately 1.3 billion people on our planet still do not have access to electricity for basic needs like clean water, cooking, sanitation, light, or for the safe storage of food and medicine. Therefore, whether we are leaders in business, policymakers in government, or decision makers in philanthropic organizations, the need to expand energy supplies has a humanitarian dimension that should inform and should guide our energy policy dialogue.”</P><P>So, following this logic, it’s humanitarian to continue, even to expand, our dangerous addiction to fossil fuels worldwide. But is it humanitarian to bury one’s head in the sand when it comes to the negative side effects of continuing this reliance?</P><P>Contrast Exxon’s and Tillerson’s message, which implies that it’s the right thing to do to lock us into a high-<mark>carbon</mark> energy future, with that made by the newly reelected President Barack Obama in his January 2013 Inaugural Address. President Obama <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>sciencewatch.org/2013/01/22/looking-ahead-from-the-inaugural-address/""><STRONG>declared</STRONG></A>:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“We will respond to the threat of <mark>climate change</mark>, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms. The path towards <mark>sustainable</mark> energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition; we must lead it.”</P><P>Evidently ExxonMobil had no intention of leading this transition; rather, the corporate attitude was spelled out clearly in its <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000003408814000012/xom10k2013.htm"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>2013 10-K report </STRONG></A>to the SEC and shareholders. Public policies that protect against environmental harms are listed as a business risk,<EM> i.e. </EM>a threat to their basic business model. Under the category “Regulatory and litigation risks” the 10-K says specifically that “changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business opportunities (including changes in laws related to offshore drilling operations, water use, or hydraulic fracturing)” are a risk to the company’s health and wellbeing. Also listed under “risks” to the bottom line are policies or regulations that promote “alternative fuels” or “uncompetitive fuel components” – as these further “expose” the company and “could adversely affect results.”</P><P>It is apparent to us that Tillerson was seeing <mark>climate change</mark> in a different light: the global warming trend was having the effect of making it possible to drill for oil in areas that had heretofore been too covered in thick ice to make drilling feasible. In February, ExxonMobil and <mark>Rosneft</mark> (Russia’s state-run oil company) agreed to <A href=""http://news.exxonmobil.com/press-release/<mark>rosneft</mark>-and-exxonmobil-expand-strategic-cooperation"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>expand the deal</STRONG></A> they made in 2011 to drill for oil in the Russian Arctic. The 10-K report mentions the new joint venture with <mark>Rosneft</mark> and talks about this massive Russia oil deal this way:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“ExxonMobil’s net acreage holdings in Sakhalin at year-end 2013 were 85 thousand acres, all offshore. A total of 0.9 net development wells were completed. Development activities continued on the Arkutun-Dagi project during 2013. At year-end 2013, ExxonMobil’s net acreage in the <mark>Rosneft</mark> joint venture agreements for the Kara and Black Seas was 11.3 million acres, all offshore.”</P><P>This Russia oil deal has raised much controversy, has now made ExxonMobil subject to penalties and fines for violating US sanctions against the country, and is a focal point of concerns surrounding the appointment of Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. This will be covered extensively in future posts.</P><P><STRONG>How was ExxonMobil Talking about Addressing the Global Threat of <mark>Climate Change</mark>?</STRONG>The <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000003408814000012/xom10k2013.htm"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>2013 10-K report</STRONG></A> address <mark>climate change</mark> and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions this way:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;""><STRONG>“<mark>Climate change</mark> and greenhouse gas restrictions.</STRONG> Due to concern over the risk of <mark>climate change</mark>, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include adoption of cap and trade regimes, <mark>carbon</mark> taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. These requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s, as well as shift hydro<mark>carbon</mark> demand toward relatively lower-<mark>carbon</mark> sources such as natural gas. Current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions.”</P><P>It is a well-known fact that cadres of highly paid lobbyists representing ExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute fought hard against the so-called Waxman-Markey bill, a comprehensive legislative proposal before the Congress in 2009 that passed the House but was not brought up in the Senate. The American Clean Energy and Security Act, if passed, would have established a broad cap-and-trade scheme and required cuts in <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions across the board. Oil, gas, and coal companies were vehemently opposed to this, and used vast resources to defeat the proposal — the only major <mark>climate</mark> bill to have real legs.</P><P>ExxonMobil’s formal position supporting a <mark>carbon</mark> tax grew out of its opposition to a cap-and-trade scheme. While many have praised the oil giant for adopting a more enlightened policy position, it is probably more accurate to say that the company’s leadership is hedging its bets and using its support for a <mark>carbon</mark> tax to help fend off stricter public policy solutions. It is also quite likely that corporate accountants have found a way to make this a win-win, monetarily, for ExxonMobil. Consider <A href=""https://www.thestreet.com/story/12728015/1/why-a-<mark>carbon</mark>-tax-could-profit-us-business-consumers.html"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>this statement</STRONG></A> regarding the company’s stated concern about regressive taxation:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“If policymakers do move to impose a cost on <mark>carbon</mark>, we believe that a <mark>carbon</mark> tax would be a more effective policy option to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions than alternatives such as cap-and-trade. And to ensure revenues raised from such a tax are indeed directed to investment, and to assist those on lower incomes who spend a higher proportion of their income on energy, a <mark>carbon</mark> tax should be offset by tax reductions in other areas to become revenue neutral for government. It is rare that a business lends its support to new taxes. But in this case, given the risk-management challenges we face and the policy alternatives under consideration, it is our judgment that a <mark>carbon</mark> tax is a preferred course of public policy action versus cap and trade approaches.”</P><P>In other words, ExxonMobil is looking for a zero-sum game in which a <mark>carbon</mark> tax would be offset by tax benefits, and the cost to the company would essentially be nil.</P><P><STRONG>How was ExxonMobil Talking about Low-<mark>Carbon</mark> Renewable Energy Options</STRONG>The company’s <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000003408814000012/xom10k2013.htm"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>2013 10-K report</STRONG></A> says this about renewable energy, referring to it as “alternative energy” that has more negative connotations in the energy business world than does the word “renewable”:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;""><STRONG>“Government sponsorship of alternative energy.</STRONG> Many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies. Governments are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources. We are conducting our own research efforts into alternative energy, such as through sponsorship of the Global <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy Project at Stanford University and research into liquid products from algae and biomass that can be further converted to transportation fuels. Our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a cost-competitive manner.”</P><P>ExxonMobil’s attempted venture into the use of algal biofuels would allow the company — if successful — to continue to use much of its existing infrastructure.

Doubtful.</P><P><STRONG>What Did the <mark>Climate</mark> Denial Force Look Like in 2013?</STRONG>The groups that set out to obfuscate the scientific findings around the <mark>climate change</mark> problem back in the 1980s had largely succeeded in creating a constellation of organizations that would become a permanent presence in the <mark>climate change</mark> landscape. In 2013, the Union of Concerned Scientists <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/solutions/fight-misinformation/global-warming-skeptic.html#.WOHBA1KZORs"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>published a document</STRONG></A> listing these groups which it refers to as “skeptic” organizations; a term CSPW takes issue with, as healthy skepticism is a lynchpin in the scientific process — without it, peer review would be a fruitless exercise. The UCS web page, “Global Warming Skeptic Organizations,” lists all the groups that take oil industry money to spread propaganda about the <mark>climate change</mark> threat and the underpinning science. The American Enterprise Institute, Americans for Prosperity, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Heartland Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and a few others are profiled. The “global warming denial machine” was alive and well in 2013, and continued to have an impact on public opinion regarding the seriousness of the problem.</P><P>Moreover, some truly ridiculous statements were being made about <mark>climate change</mark> by people who had a voice in American discourse and a responsibility not to say such things. The June 2013 issue of <EM>Rolling Stone </EM>published some of these utterings, several made by prominent elected officials, in its funny article, “<A href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-10-dumbest-things-ever-said-about-global-warming-20130619"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>The 10 Dumbest Things Ever Said About Global Warming</STRONG></A>,” just as likely to draw tears as it is to invoke laughter. Yet, this was part and parcel to the groupthink at the time, and in many ways, still is: sad, but true.</P><P><STRONG>High Marks to the Obama Administration for Taking on <mark>Climate Change</mark> Impact Preparedness</STRONG>In 2008, <mark>Climate</mark> Science Watch called for the US federal government to take on a National <mark>Climate Change</mark> Preparedness Initiative. On November 1, 2013, President Obama signed an Executive Order doing just that. As CSW founder Rick Piltz <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>sciencewatch.org/2013/11/04/obama-preparedness-executive-order-part1/""><STRONG>noted at the time</STRONG></A>, the order, “Preparing the United States for the Impacts of <mark>Climate Change</mark>,” was long overdue. Piltz stated:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“It has taken 25 years – since the global warming problem was first recognized as a major public issue — to get to this stage, with <mark>climate change</mark> preparedness planning and action being framed as a U.S. presidential order to the Executive Branch.”</P><P>One can only imagine the extent of lives saved, habitat spared from destruction, property damage avoided, if such an initiative had taken hold decades earlier. The failure to prepare adequately for <mark>climate</mark> conditions has imposed a heavy cost, one that only goes up over time.</P><P>While this Preparedness Initiative only went so far, and never truly took a strong hold on local, state, or federal public policymaking, it is an idea that should be supported and expanded, not abandoned as the Trump Administration has clearly done.</P><P>In sum, the Exxon Mobil Corporation has not been taking the <mark>climate change</mark> threat seriously enough to do justice to its investors and shareholders. Old-school mentality dominates the corporate culture, and has been articulated clearly year after year in its 10-K reports to shareholders. The truth about <mark>climate change</mark> is now coming back to bite this oil giant.</P><P> </P><P><EM>CSPW Senior <mark>Climate Policy</mark> Analyst <STRONG>Anne Polansky</STRONG> has 30 years of experience in public policies relating to energy and the environment, with a strong focus on <mark>climate change</mark> and renewable energy.

His thesis was straightforward: he thought the U.S. economy would see improved growth under President Trump, pulling up global gross domestic product—and with it, oil demand.</P><P>That growth would mean Saudi Arabia would be closer to maxed out on its capability to produce oil, no longer a significant threat to U.S. shale. Under this world view, American producers would be able wrest more market share in the future without fear of toppling prices, hence the Trump administration’s optimistic view of U.S. energy <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-first-doesnt-mean-america-alone-1496187426"" title=""“dominance.”"" target=""_blank"">“dominance.”</A></P><SECTION class=""more-on desktop-only ""><P class=""more-on__title"">More on:</P><P class=""more-on__content""><A href=""/middle-east-and-north-africa/saudi-arabia"" class=""more-on__link"">Saudi Arabia</A></P></SECTION><P>At the time, it seemed like a rosy prognostication. I pointed out how easily Russia, armed with a cheap ruble and flexible tax policy, could also increase its own oil output.But 2018 is now around the corner and that conversation now seems somewhat more prophetic. It raises the question: What would it mean for Saudi Arabia and U.S. shale producers if Russia does an about-face and makes a production push.</P><P>It’s something to watch.</P><P>Because, while Saudi Arabia might not be technically maxed out, global demand is on the rise and Saudi ability to flood the market to punish challengers is, at least for the moment, greatly reduced.</P><P><A href=""https://www.cfr.org/blog/oil-and-more-muscular-saudi-arabia"">Not only is the kingdom boxed in to supporting higher prices because of domestic economic pressures and its planned initial public offering (IPO) of state oil giant Saudi Aramco</A>, it is also facing long term oil field problems that will not be cheap or easy to fix. Already this year, an unexpected corrosion problem at a significant pipeline at the large Manifa field reduced Saudi spare capacity. Saudi Aramco’s hefty new capital budget reportedly targets increases at three offshore fields by 2022 to replace declining capacity elsewhere but past efforts to expand <mark>sustainable</mark> production capacity have been a painstaking process, stretching over more than a decade at a cost of tens of billions of dollars. The next tranche will be even more challenging.</P><P>Regardless of its handicap versus the United States and Russia at adding new producing areas in its oil fields, Saudi Arabia is not yet abdicating its leadership role. It took a pro-active stance towards recent deliberations to extend OPEC-non-OPEC production cuts into 2018. Saudi’s steadfast commitment to the deal was not initially reciprocated by Russia, which was more tentative in public statements leading up to the November OPEC meeting. The cat and mouse process led one seasoned journalist to note Russian President Vladimir Putin has <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-24/putin-crowns-himself-opec-king"" title=""“crowned himself king of OPEC.”"" target=""_blank"">“crowned himself king of OPEC.”</A> The sequence of events prompted questioning whether Russia has finally achieved what four decades of sponsored military proxies failed to do—surreptitiously gaining sway over Saudi oil policy.For its part, <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-14/russia-is-said-to-hesitate-on-length-of-opec-oil-cuts-extension"" title=""Russia’s stated concern about a production cut extension"" target=""_blank"">Russia’s stated concern about a production cut extension</A> was linked in part to the advantage higher oil prices are giving to <A href=""https://www.ft.com/content/3c6ca27c-ca11-11e7-ab18-7a9fb7d6163e"" title=""U.S. shale producers"" target=""_blank"">U.S. shale producers</A>. Russian oil companies complained to Moscow about their excess of 1.2 million barrels a day (b/d) of new oil field projects they’d like to green light. A Citibank report, “From Russia with Love – A Crude Romance,” suggests that not only do Russia’s largest companies have 300,000 b/d in idled current capacity, they are sitting on some 23 fields that could add substantial new production in the next five years, including 14 fields on state firm <mark>Rosneft</mark>’s books aggregating 770,000 b/d. Russia also has untapped shale potential.</P><SECTION class=""more-on mobile-only ""><P class=""more-on__title"">More on:</P><P class=""more-on__content""><A href=""/middle-east-and-north-africa/saudi-arabia"" class=""more-on__link"">Saudi Arabia</A></P></SECTION><P>Any Russian increases will come head to head with rising U.S. oil production, which <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-oil-eia-outlook/eia-raises-2018-u-s-oil-output-forecast-to-highest-on-record-idUSKBN1E62IP"" title=""the U.S. Energy Information Administration said last week could hit 10 million b/d in 2018, up 780,000 b/d"" target=""_blank"">the U.S. Energy Information Administration said last week could hit 10 million b/d in 2018, up 780,000 b/d</A>. Analysts at Cornerstone Macro are similarly bullish on U.S. supply, especially should prices be above $60 a barrel. They project U.S. tight oil production could rise by 960,000 b/d next year (ex-natural gas liquids) and an additional 770,000 b/d in 2019, if prices hold around $60, bringing total U.S. crude oil production above 11 million b/d over the next two years. Increases would be even larger in a $65 oil price environment, Cornerstone Macro suggests. Longer term, the upward potential for U.S. production could be substantially higher than that, with some estimates as high as 20 million b/d.</P><P>The storyline that lack of access to new funds would force capital discipline and thereby lower production gains, (e.g. focus on profits, not growth), looks increasingly questionable given that <A href=""https://www.ft.com/content/5469ca98-e065-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce"" title=""oil and gas exploration and production companies have raised more than $60 billion in bond sales so far this year"" target=""_blank""> oil and gas exploration and production companies have raised more than $60 billion in bond sales so far this year</A>, levels typical of pre-price drop conditions.

Traders, shale investors, and even reportedly Saudi Arabia, are betting that continued problems in Caracas, among other locales, will make ample room for U.S. rising production. Longer term, there are more producers in line to increase exports, including Iran, Iraq, Brazil, and Canada, to name a few.</P><P>But the real geopolitical showdown for market share will likely come down to Russia and the United States: who can bring on new oil fastest?</P><P>A looming U.S.-Russia oil and gas rivalry has deep geopolitical implications. It works against improvement in bilateral relations and is a delicate security matter for trading partners of both countries.</P><P>The possible conflict over market share is existential to Russian power. Washington’s energy dominance tack, which recently included an <A href=""http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-oversees-major-natural-gas-deal-between-alaska-china/article/2640134"" title=""announced gas export deal for Alaska"" target=""_blank"">announced gas export deal for Alaska</A> during the Trump visit to Beijing, sounds as threatening to Russian ears <A href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/713660353?journalCode=tsur20"" title=""as NATO expansion did a decade or more ago"" target=""_blank"">as NATO expansion did a decade or more ago</A>. Not only does Russia rely heavily on its energy exports for its statist budget and as a diplomatic lever, but the commanding heights of Putin’s inner circle and his grip on power is intimately inter-linked with Russia’s oil and gas elite. <A href=""https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/new-alignments-the-geopolitics-of-gas-and-oil-cartels-and-the-changing-middle-east/"" title=""Russian influence and economic health has suffered in the past from orchestrated alliances between the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar"" target=""_blank"">Russian influence and economic health has suffered in the past from orchestrated alliances between the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar</A> that targeted Russia’s energy earnings. The threat of rising U.S. oil and gas exports could be one factor encouraging increasingly risky Russian adventurism since doing nothing about it could neutralize a major tool of Russian foreign policy.</P><P>For now, Russia seems content to collaborate with Saudi Arabia on oil market stability which ironically also suits the current U.S. administration, whose America first jobs message is tied heavily to the economic engine of the shale revolution.</P><P>But that delicate oil truce rests on the back of Venezuela and its woes, which is making space for everyone. At some later date, if Saudi stability seems vulnerable to continuing proxy wars in the Middle East, Putin may be tempted to see if he can tip the scales further in Russia’s favor, making additional space for his long term export surge and rendering his giant reserves all the more important.</P><P><EM>This article first appeared as a “Gray Matters” column in the Houston Chronicle. </EM></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""chapters""><DIV class=""chapters__btn-toggle""><SVG viewbox=""0 0 20 11"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" class=""icon icon-up-arrow""><TITLE>Up</TITLE></SVG></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

That simple principle, called <EM>Piliriqatigiingniq,</EM> is a pillar of an ancient social code that has guided Inuit through centuries of hardship, to sustain life and community in one of Earth’s most lethal environments.</P><P>Since the end of the <A href=""http://time.com/4722615/donald-trump-russia-cold-war-putin-kremlin/"">Cold War</A>, the U.S., Russia and six other circumpolar neighbors have quietly worked together in the Arctic Council, a sort of United Nations of the North, even when frictions created heated disputes farther south. Now, as ancient <A href=""http://time.com/4745827/antarctica-water-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">Arctic ice</A> barriers melt to nothing, the rush to exploit oil, natural gas and other resources has quickened, threatening to destabilize the region.</P><P>Secretary of State Rex Tillerson raised hopes Thursday that Arctic cooperation might continue to trump rising tensions elsewhere in the world while handing over the rotating chairmanship of the Arctic Council to Finland. Despite an intense debate in the White House over whether to pull out of the 2015 Paris Agreement to fight <mark>climate change</mark>, Tillerson joined the Council’s seven other permanent members in signing a fresh commitment to the accord. But he cautioned that U.S. interests, not the views of other countries, will guide Washington’s decision on whether to remain in the <mark>climate</mark> action agreement.</P><P>President Donald Trump’s recent decision to overturn <A href=""http://time.com/4608280/arctic-drilling-barack-obama-trump/"">President Barack Obama’s</A> 2016 ban on offshore Arctic drilling pushes the frontiers of fossil fuel extraction further north, right when the world is supposed to be sharply cutting back its <mark>carbon</mark> output. A dangerous Arctic paradox has opened: shrinking ice creates more space to compete over, which increases the pace of the onrush. Forces could be unleashed that endanger more than the spirit of polar cooperation. The health of the planet is at risk.</P><P>The Arctic is <A href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/13/505434080/scientists-report-the-arctic-is-melting-even-more-rapidly"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">warming</A> at least twice as fast as anywhere else on Earth. Making it easier to drill massive new fields of oil and natural gas would help fuel a <mark>climate</mark> catastrophe. Up to a quarter of the world’s undiscovered <A href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=4650"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">fossil fuel</A> reserves are concealed north of the Arctic Circle. More than 80% of that lies <A href=""https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2008/3049/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">beneath the sea</A>, according to a U.S. Geological Survey estimate.</P><P>When Tillerson was <A href=""http://time.com/4750792/exxon-mobil-treasury-waiver-russia/"">Exxon</A>’s CEO, he signed a $500 billion deal with <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-<mark>rosneft</mark>-idUSBRE83H0UE20120418"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><mark>Rosneft</mark></A>, Russia’s state-owned oil company, to find and tap Arctic reserves. That stalled under economic sanctions following Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Exxon has asked the Treasury Department for an exemption in the <A href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/21/white-house-refuses-to-give-exxonmobil-special-waiver-to-drill-in-sanctioned-russia.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Black Sea</A>, a request that was rejected. If broader sanctions eventually do melt away with the Arctic ice, more cracks will undermine the 175-nation Paris Agreement to wean the world off fossil fuels.</P><P><A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org//news/31032017/-<mark>climate</mark>-change-science-greenland-global-warming-ice-melt"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Scientists</A> warn the Far North may be near, or already past, a <mark>climate</mark> <A href=""http://time.com/4734991/arctic-ice-photographer-mario-tama-exploration/"">tipping point</A>. Caught in a calamitous feedback loop, the planet’s natural air conditioner may be breaking down. <A href=""https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/sea-ice-extent-sinks-to-record-lows-at-both-poles"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Sea ice</A> receded to a new record low at both poles this winter. At least three times, <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/02/10/temperatures-in-the-arctic-are-skyrocketing-for-the-third-time-this-winter/?utm_term=.1912addc9910"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">temperatures</A> soared as high as 50 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. Ominous signs suggest the Greenland ice sheet may be headed for complete meltdown. That would raise sea levels by 24 feet, according to a recent study.</P><P>The U.S. military warns that <A href=""https://<mark>climate</mark>andsecurity.org/militaryexpertpanel/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">rising seas</A> already threaten coastal bases and “will present serious risks to military readiness, operations and strategy,” an expert panel reported last fall. <A href=""https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/07/f24/QER%20Analysis%20-%20<mark>Climate</mark>%20Change%20and%20Energy%20Infrastructure%20Exposure%20to%20Storm%20Surge%20and%20Sea-Level%20Rise_0.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Oil refineries</A> along the Gulf Coast are increasingly vulnerable to storm surges. Around the world, millions of people living near oceans and river deltas may become refugees as homes and farms, factories and offices, end up under water.</P><P>For centuries, ice barriers have protected the High Arctic from the bloody competition for resources that has scarred other parts of the planet. They are collapsing. This opens new perils for international security. Russia is expanding on its substantial, Soviet-era lead in Arctic military power and civilian infrastructure. The <A href=""http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/25/heres-what-russias-military-build-up-in-the-arctic-looks-like-trump-oil-military-high-north-infographic-map/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Trump Administration</A> is committed to responding to what it calls Russian aggression.</P><P>As the Arctic rapidly warms, and the sea ice barrier recedes, cooperation that has been the hallmark of circumpolar politics since the end of the Cold War is fracturing. “The Arctic is key strategic terrain,” Secretary of Defense James Mattis told Congress during his confirmation hearings. “Russia is taking aggressive steps to increase its presence there. I will prioritize the development of an integrated strategy for the Arctic.” Russian President <A href=""https://www.rt.com/news/319394-arctic-military-base-islands/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Vladimir Putin</A>‘s military buildup has included moving two brigades to the Far North, reopening several airstrips, and starting construction of a new base in the Laptev Sea.</P><P>Mattis also told Congress “<mark>climate change</mark> is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today” and combat planners need to take a warming planet into account. That’s especially true in the Arctic, where Russia has long been the dominant power.</P><P>Russia has more icebreakers than the rest of the world combined, with plans for at least 11 more, including nuclear-powered vessels strong enough to penetrate ice several yards thick.</P><P>The <A href=""http://www.cfr.org/arctic/arctic-imperatives/p38868"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">U.S. Coast Guard</A> has two seaworthy conventional icebreakers, the medium-class USCGC <EM>Healy</EM> and the much older USCGC <EM>Polar Star</EM>, a heavy icebreaker commissioned in 1976. The Coast Guard, which needs a fleet of six icebreakers according to a Department of Homeland Security assessment, has only one in the design stage. If built, it could cost $1 billion.</P><P>At a recent conference on the Arctic in Archangelsk, <A href=""https://www.newsdeeply.com/arctic/articles/2017/03/30/putin-plays-mr-nice-guy-at-russian-arctic-forum"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Putin</A> tried to calm security concerns by stressing a desire to “maintain the Arctic as a space of peace, stability and mutual cooperation.” But Russia’s Arctic neighbors remain suspicious. <A href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39140100"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Sweden</A> brought back the military draft in March and, along with Finland, is debating whether to join NATO, which could spur Russia to further strengthen its Arctic forces.</P><P>The history of <A href=""https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/07/f24/QER%20Analysis%20-%20<mark>Climate</mark>%20Change%20and%20Energy%20Infrastructure%20Exposure%20to%20Storm%20Surge%20and%20Sea-Level%20Rise_0.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">human conflict</A> over resources is long and ugly, but it doesn’t have to spread to the top of the world. Russia’s military strength in the Arctic is still far below Cold War levels. Green energy sources are getting steadily cheaper, and becoming more widespread, which could persuade investors that pushing higher into the Arctic for fossil fuels isn’t worth it.</P><P>We still have time to pause, listen and heed the Arctic’s lessons, as the Inuit did long ago.</P><DIV class=""component inline-tout media footer-variation""><DIV class=""media-img"">IDEAS</DIV><DIV class=""media-body"">TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary on events in news, society, and culture.

Maxim Khudalov, an analyst at AKRA, believes that the growing volumes in warehouses close to Rusal’s plants have spurred the growth of shipments within Russia. According to the expert, this aluminum will be purchased by small traders, which do not fear sanctions and will try to use various export schemes. Russian consumers could likewise increase purchase volumes, but it is not the right time for that now, since aluminum prices have risen, and Rusal is hardly ready to sell it at old prices.</P><P>Judging by data provided by Russian Railways, Rusal shipped about half of the aluminum to warehouses in April, Kommersant’s source in an investment company said.

The transcript of the launch is available on <A href=""http://www.kremlin.ru/"">www.kremlin.ru</A>.</P><P>According to Mr Sechin, the drilling at the Tsentralno-Olginskaya-1 well is the first in the eastern Arctic. It will be drilled from the Hara-Tumus Peninsula under the Laptev Sea.</P><P>&quot;We carried out 21,000 running kilometers of seismic surveys, which revealed about 114 promising underground oil and gas traps.

The company will confirm a number of geological parameters to make a final decision on exploration depth. This will continue until August 2017.</P><P>According to RIA Novosti, the Khatangsky block is located in Khatanga Bay in the Laptev Sea in the north of the Krasnoyarsk Sea. <mark>Rosneft</mark> owns 28 blocks on the Arctic shelf with total estimated reserves of 34 billion tons of oil equivalent.

It is no surprise that this year, writer and mafia expert Roberto Saviano called the UK “<A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/29/roberto-saviano-london-is-heart-of-global-financial-corruption"" target=""_blank"">the most corrupt place on Earth</A>”.</P><H2>Keep it in the ground </H2><P>The Oil &amp; Money conference throws light on an important convergence — the link between <mark>climate change</mark> and corruption.</P><P>Across the world, corruption is frequently cited in polls as a <A href=""http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/11/06/crime-and-corruption-top-problems-in-emerging-and-developing-countries/"" target=""_blank"">top problem</A>. Stolen state funds mean underfunded healthcare, unbuilt schools and depleted social programmes. Money destined for aid or disaster relief is siphoned off. Corruption cements unfairness: university places and degrees are bought, <A href=""http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2015/08/peru-rotten-wood-150812105020949.html"" target=""_blank"">impunity is purchased</A>, and hospital beds are auctioned.

The fossil fuel industry spends <A href=""http://priceofoil.org/thepriceofoil/corruption/"" target=""_blank"">hundreds of millions</A> of US dollars every year <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dark-money-funds-<mark>climate</mark>-change-denial-effort/"" target=""_blank"">corrupting science</A> and politics through sponsorship, <A href=""http://www.desmog.uk/2016/04/08/oil-giants-spend-114m-obstruct-<mark>climate</mark>-policy-s-just-tip-iceberg"" target=""_blank"">lobbying</A>, and think-tank funding. This has allowed the industry to shape public discourse, gain proximity to decision-makers and exert decisive influence over political processes. In Russia, for example, the lobbying weight of the fossil fuel industry is <A href=""https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/renewable-energy-feared-by-oil-lobby-7494"" target=""_blank"">frequently cited</A> as the <A href=""http://deepde<mark>carbon</mark>ization.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DDPP-Factsheet_Russia.pdf"" target=""_blank"">leading impediment</A> to the <A href=""http://bellona.org/news/renewable-energy/2016-01-russia-pushes-for-renewables-but-entrenched-power-lobbies-and-poor-organization-remain-foes"" target=""_blank"">development of renewable energy</A>.</P><P>Political corruption is an investment which pays off like no other.

In the UK for example, the Minister of State for Energy and <mark>Climate Change</mark> from 2010 to 2014 was Greg Barker, <A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/newsdesk/energy/analysis/whos-who-energy-greg-baker"" target=""_blank"">previously employed by Sibneft</A>. Sergey Donskoy, Russia’s Minister for Natural Resources, worked at Zarubezhneft and Lukoil. </P><P>The revolving door turns both ways, as government officials leave office to enter private business.

While much of the early opposition to Tillerson's nomination has focused on his close ties to Russia—Tillerson received the Russian &quot;<A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/13/what-is-the-russian-order-of-friendship-and-why-does-trumps-pick-for-secretary-of-state-have-one/?utm_term=.d905f132ab09"" target=""_blank"">Order of Friendship</A>&quot; from Vladimir Putin—Tillerson's potential to do lasting damage to global <mark>climate</mark> progress cannot be taken lightly. </P><P>Several former State Department officials I spoke with say the department's role in <mark>climate</mark> progress worldwide—and the role that <mark>climate change</mark> negotiations have played in ensuring general global stability—cannot be understated. </P><P>In her first year as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton created a new department within the State Department <A href=""http://www.state.gov/s/<mark>climate</mark>/"" target=""_blank"">called the Special Envoy for <mark>Climate Change</mark></A>; this department was critical in negotiating the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement and the <A href=""http://motherboard.vice.com/read/obama-and-china-cut-a-deal-that-just-might-save-the-world"">US-China agreement that preceded it</A>. </P><P>&quot;This is not first and foremost about saving the environment for its own sake,&quot; Paul Bodnar, former counselor to the envoy and now a senior fellow at the Rocky Mountain Institute, told me. &quot;It's about protecting our economic and security interests around the world. If you support food security, global health, poverty eradication, you should be very concerned about how <mark>climate change</mark> works to counteract those goals.&quot; </P><P>Lucky for us, it's impossible to completely separate Tillerson's Russian connections from his potential to do harm to the environment at the State Department. This fact may allow Republicans who feel uneasy about his ties to Putin to find common ground with Democrats hoping to salvage <mark>climate</mark> deals signed under the Obama administration by opposing Tillerson. </P><P>For instance: In 2011, ExxonMobil struck a deal with the Russian government-owned oil company <mark>Rosneft</mark> to exploit three new oil frontiers in the Black Sea, Siberia, and the Arctic. But sanctions stemming from Russia's invasion of Crimea scuttled that deal, <A href=""http://motherboard.vice.com/read/tillerson-putin-arctic-oil"">which cost Exxon $1 billion</A>. With Tillerson as Secretary of State, a Trump administration could repeal these sanctions, which could put that deal back on the table, and more importantly could hasten drilling in the Arctic, which is <A href=""http://motherboard.vice.com/read/arctic-report-card-noaa-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">perhaps the most threatened region on Earth</A>. </P><P>But Tillerson's potential to do damage to <mark>climate</mark> progress extends far beyond possible new drilling projects in Russia, which should be considered little more than a sideshow compared to what's at stake in the rest of the world. </P><P>&quot;The focus on <mark>climate</mark> at the international level has completely changed and transformed over the last decade, particularly the role the US has had in terms of diplomatic leadership,&quot; Jessica Brown, former Foreign Affairs Officer and lead <mark>climate</mark> finance negotiator at the State Department, told me. &quot;There has been a lot of trust built between the US and other countries because of the progress we've made on <mark>climate</mark> agreements.&quot; </P><P>While the science of <mark>climate change</mark> and whether we should do anything about it has been very much politicized in the United States, there is widespread global consensus that <mark>climate change</mark> is a top-tier issue, and progress must move forward. If the US starts ignoring treaties or stops leading the way on <mark>climate</mark> issues, America could quite quickly find itself diplomatically ostracized. </P><P>&quot;Frankly, the concern is that if the Trump administration does a u-turn on <mark>climate change</mark> in terms of its commitment to Paris Agreement and its commitment to move in lockstep with the 190 countries in addressing this challenge, it would have a negative effect on ability too right <mark>climate change</mark> but would affect its abilities to advance other interests in the world,&quot; Bodnar said. </P><P>This, too is an important point. The Paris Agreement must be considered one of the more impressive feats of global diplomacy, and there have been undeniable side benefits from that cooperation. </P><P>&quot;We saw positive knock-on effects from our leadership on <mark>climate</mark> on other areas,&quot; he said. </P><P>Those knock-on effects have been particularly important in our <A href=""http://motherboard.vice.com/read/obama-and-china-cut-a-deal-that-just-might-save-the-world"">frequently fraught relationship with China</A>; <mark>climate</mark> cooperation has kept diplomatic doors open there. Again, these international agreements are negotiated by the State Department, and so having an oil-friendly Secretary of State could very well do more damage to <mark>climate</mark> progress than perhaps even Scott Pruitt could at the EPA. </P><P>&quot;To forfeit areas of mutual benefit with China unilaterally and voluntarily seems like the wrong thing for the Secretary of State to be doing at this time,&quot; Pete Ogden, who studies <mark>climate policy</mark> at the Center for American Progress and formerly worked at the State Department and in the White House, told me. </P><P>This brings us to the hugely important question of what kind of Secretary of State Tillerson might be. While those desperate looking for a bright spot for the environment in Trump's cabinet have pointed out that Tillerman and ExxonMobil have both acknowledged <mark>climate change</mark> in recent years, the fact remains that the company, and by extension, Tillerman, have historically been some of the worst <mark>climate</mark> actors. </P><P>In an excellent <A href=""http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/rex-tillersons-state-of-denial"" target=""_blank""><I>New Yorker</I></A> piece, Elizabeth Kolbert points out that those hoping for Tillerson to be progressive on <mark>climate</mark> are quite possibly delusional. </P><P>&quot;Tillerson is smart enough to have positioned himself, and repositioned his company, so that there's now at least confusion about where he stands,&quot; she wrote. &quot;But you have to be pretty desperate—and at this point many people are—to take this as cause for optimism.&quot; </P><P>Under Tillerson's leadership, ExxonMobil has moved away from overt <mark>climate</mark> denial and has started engaging in what Kolbert calls more &quot;insidious&quot; forms of denial. A <A href=""https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2803702/AGU-Report-Final-20160325.pdf"" target=""_blank"">report by MIT and Harvard researchers</A> released earlier this year noted that ExxonMobil still &quot;financially supports more than 100 <mark>climate</mark>-denying members of Congress and continues to generate its own misinformative comments about <mark>climate</mark> science.&quot; That means while the company have publicly changed its tune about <mark>climate change</mark> and greenhouse gas emissions, Tillerson cannot simply be given the benefit of the doubt or be deemed the most enlightened of Trump's cabinet picks. </P><P>&quot;While ExxonMobil does today acknowledge the reality of anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> in its public statements, it also continues to support and perpetuate <mark>climate</mark> science misinformation through a variety of increasingly veiled initiatives,&quot; the report found. Within the last three years, Tillerson has publicly questioned the validity of <mark>climate</mark> models, temperature records, and has called into question the findings of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>. </P><P>Hoping against hope that Tillerson will stand up as the lone supporter of global <mark>climate</mark> progress in a cabinet that is loaded with deniers is an act of desperation. But if we must muscle up some <mark>climate</mark> optimism in the Trump administration, perhaps the best we can hope that Trump's interests align with our broader environmental ones. </P><P>&quot;<mark>Climate</mark> is central to issues that do seem to be important to Trump, like security and the refugee crisis in Syria,&quot; Brown said. &quot;Thinking about the Syrian crisis, several reports note the link between it and <mark>climate change</mark>-related droughts. If security and refugee issues are important to Trump, it would make sense for them to continue the progress that's been made.&quot; </P><P><B>Scott Pruitt, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency</B></P><DIV class=""article__media""><PICTURE class=""article__image""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 25em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/40553/1481914459939724.jpg?resize=400:*, https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/40553/1481914459939724.jpg?resize=600:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 40.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/40553/1481914459939724.jpg?resize=650:*, https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/40553/1481914459939724.jpg?resize=975:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 53.125em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/40553/1481914459939724.jpg?resize=850:*, https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/40553/1481914459939724.jpg?resize=1275:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 65.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/40553/1481914459939724.jpg?resize=1050:*, https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/40553/1481914459939724.jpg?resize=1575:* 2x""><P class=""article__image-caption"">Image: <A href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/gageskidmore/16502619990/in/photolist-r9heYS-r9oCJP-rqQHPX-eac2U8-E3i3aK-rqKgqb-nbH2zo-nsVqj3-nbGwQY-nbGtUu-9mXmBW-6LaCys-nbGqz2-nbGnqM-nteJif-nte9nu-r9g9xm-nbH1aX-qu4gpp-nbH3D4-nsV2gZ-qu49w6-nsUuWa-nr9pGw-nbGtX2-nsVpdW-nbGWWL-roxxSu-nbGpWD-r7w9jM-roxzyL-9mXnoy-nsVe6S-ntbZYR-8sDtvi-r9hceU-nbGyyQ-9mUjLk-nbGr7W-nbGZRS-nbGJ5d-nuY8Px-8vGwz2-nsVi6A-8sGwmo-roxGE9-8sGwrC-nr9QVs-9mXnt3-ntc6ii"" target=""_blank"">Gage Skidmore/Flickr</A></P></SOURCE></SOURCE></SOURCE></SOURCE></PICTURE></DIV><P>While Tillerson could wreak havoc on America's foreign <mark>climate</mark> obligations, no one is better positioned to dismantle <mark>climate change</mark> policies domestically than Scott Pruitt. </P><P>If confirmed by the Senate to run the EPA, the Oklahoma attorney general will have leeway to chip away at important regulations that ensure clean land, air, and water. And centered in his crosshairs is the proposed Clean Power Plan, a <mark>climate change</mark> and human health policy that's immensely popular in many states, but is reviled by Republicans for mandating emissions limits on power plants. </P><P>Pruitt is best known for being a key architect of the <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/us/politics/scott-pruitt-epa-trump.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">28-state</A> lawsuit in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia against President Obama's <mark>climate</mark> rules. Here, he's waged a legal battle against the Clean Power Plan—an emissions-limiting policy that will be crucial to America's Paris Agreement pledge—calling it an unconstitutional <A href=""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/27/politics/clean-power-plan-obama/"" target=""_blank"">power-grab</A> on behalf of the EPA. If Pruitt, at the urging of President-elect Trump, allows the United States to default on the Paris Agreement, this could burden <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/21/trump-threat-paris-agreement-california-<mark>climate</mark>-change"" target=""_blank"">individual states</A> with finding new ways to meet the nation's emissions goals. </P><P>&quot;Pruitt opposes the mission of the agency he's been asked to lead. He rejects the science the EPA has developed, and is essentially unwilling to uphold the laws that Congress has given it to enforce. It's enormously troubling that he's in a position to subvert standards and protections already in place, and to do it under the mantle of the agency intended to protect the public from environmental threats,&quot; Bradley Campbell, president of the Conservation Law Foundation, told me. </P><P>Unlike other nominees, there's little need to infer Pruitt's allegiance to oil, gas, and coal interests based on things like political funding. (For the record, however, during election years, he received <A href=""http://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?c-t-eid=6583668&amp;d-cci=36,33&amp;d-ccb=95,98,97#%5B%7B1%7Cgro=y"" target=""_blank"">$314,996</A> from the fossil fuel industry since 2002.) Pruitt's longstanding friendship with energy companies was revealed in a Pulitzer Prize-winning <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/us/politics/energy-firms-in-secretive-alliance-with-attorneys-general.html"" target=""_blank"">investigation</A> by the <I>New York Times</I> from 2014, which shed an unforgiving light on the mutualistic dealings between state lawmakers and utility giants. </P><P>The expose, based on emails obtained through an open-records request, uncovered an alliance between energy companies and Republican attorneys general that had been forged, in part, by Pruitt. In exchange for fighting federal regulations, these companies would generously donate to the campaign coffers of their sponsors. Pruitt's interactions with Oklahoma's Devon Energy, a utility based out of his home-state, were especially conniving. </P><P>A <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/07/us/politics/1-devon-energy-scripted-letters.html"" target=""_blank"">collection of emails</A> dating back to 2011 proved that Devon Energy's legal staff had written several letters sent from Pruitt to the EPA, Obama Administration, and Department of the Interior, lobbying on behalf of the company's interests. &quot;Outstanding!&quot; wrote a Devon Energy representative to the attorney general's office, regarding an email sent to EPA administrator Lisa Jackson about methane emissions. </P><P>It's this kind of thinking that Trump almost certainly values in Pruitt. While many of the lawmaker's attempts to thwart environmental rules <A href=""https://www.edf.org/blog/2016/11/30/epa-candidate-brags-about-suing-agency-calls-<mark>climate</mark>-science-unsettled"" target=""_blank"">have failed</A>, he's exhibited a willingness to go to bat for the fossil fuel industry. Now, emboldened by a like-minded administration, and empowered with authority, Pruitt may never have as good an opportunity to expand his pro-drilling agenda nationwide, and possibly with less &quot;job-killing&quot; regulation. </P><P>&quot;What Pruitt and his lawyers have been trying to do is make it much more difficult for administrations in the future to regulate <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. Pruitt will likely be part of a team of lawyers charged with rolling back the legal underpinnings of how we've been forced to regulate <mark>carbon</mark>. We're going to feel the consequences of that in lives,&quot; Jamie Henn, communications director and co-founder of 350.org, told me. </P><P>Shortly after Pruitt's candidacy was announced, the attorney general stated his intentions for the EPA, stoking the fears of environmentalists that he would betray the agency's core mission. </P><P>Considering Trump's vocal contempt for EPA oversight, as well as his promise to &quot;unleash an energy revolution,&quot; it's not unlikely that Pruitt will use his position to benefit fossil fuel companies while simultaneously unraveling <mark>climate</mark> action. </P><P>&quot;The American people are tired of seeing billions of dollars drained from our economy due to unnecessary EPA regulations, and I intend to run this agency in a way that fosters both responsible protection of the environment and freedom for American businesses,&quot; Pruitt said in a press release last week. </P><P>A few Democrats have already challenged Pruitt's nomination, such as Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz, <A href=""http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/08/politics/senate-democrats-trump-epa-scott-pruitt/"" target=""_blank"">who called</A> the lawmaker a &quot;professional <mark>climate change</mark> denier,&quot; and urged fellow party-members to block his confirmation.

While the Republican congressman from Montana shares many qualities with the likes of Rex Tillerson and Scott Pruitt, he strays the course on a few interesting issues. </P><P>Zinke, a geologist, reneged his acknowledgment of global warming in recent years, but before that, the congressman was advocating for <mark>climate</mark> action. In 2010, he signed onto <A href=""http://intelligentdiscontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/CLEAN-Sign-on-letter-with-1210.pdf"" target=""_blank"">a letter</A> from the Coalition of Legislators for Energy Action Now that called <mark>climate change</mark> &quot;a threat multiplier for instability in the most volatile regions of the world,&quot; and asked the Obama Administration to pass a suit of clean energy and <mark>climate change</mark> laws. </P><P>Since then, Zinke has backed down on his initial beliefs, calling the actual science of <mark>climate change</mark> <A href=""http://www.montanakaimin.com/news/article_0ec6d8be-6066-11e4-87f0-001a4bcf6878.html"" target=""_blank"">into question</A>, and eventually <A href=""http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/shields-and-brooks-on-joni-ernsts-sotu-response/"" target=""_blank"">refuting it</A> as a man-made phenomenon. Because of this, his qualifications for Secretary of the Interior, which would give him jurisdiction over 20 percent of America's public lands—including those vulnerable to <mark>climate change</mark>—are worth questioning, but not without hope for science-based reasoning. </P><P>Still, over the course of his career, Zinke has received<A href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cycle=Career&amp;type=I&amp;cid=N00035616&amp;newMem=N"" target=""_blank""> $345,136</A> in campaign funding from the oil and gas industry.

Sources close to the transition team said Trump's eldest son—a passionate hunter—ultimately preferred Zinke for his position on public lands as they relate to hunting access. </P><P>&quot;The younger Mr. Trump has a longtime interest in preserving wilderness areas for hunting and fishing, and Mr. Zinke's own opposition to selling off federal lands stems from his concern that it would mean less access to public lands for outdoor sports,&quot; wrote Amy Harder for the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>. &quot;This dynamic helps explain why the president-elect settled on a relatively little-known figure for his interior pick, unlike his choices for most other high-profile posts.&quot; </P><P>The congressman has rustled a modicum of goodwill from environmentalists for supporting the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which allocates some oil and gas royalties to conservation projects, and for occasionally splitting with his party to defend public access to federal lands. </P><P>However, Zinke was given a 3 percent score by the League of Conservation Voters, and his nomination was taken with a generous dose of skepticism by organizations like the Center for Biological Diversity, <A href=""http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2016/ryan-zinke-12-13-2016.php"" target=""_blank"">who noted</A> that despite his modest record on public lands, Zinke &quot;consistently votes for the interests of oil and gas companies, which is not surprising since Oasis Petroleum is his largest campaign contributor and the oil and gas industry is his third-largest sector contributor.&quot; </P><P>Indeed, Zinke has voted in support of <A href=""http://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/ryan-zinke"" target=""_blank"">numerous</A> fossil fuel development bills, and <A href=""https://zinke.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/zinke-president-s-rejection-keystone-it-s-just-wrong"" target=""_blank"">opposed</A> President Obama's rejection of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would funnel 830,000 barrels of crude oil per day from Canada's oil sands to Texas. And while Zinke is in favor of an &quot;all of the above&quot; energy mix, which President Obama <A href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/05/29/new-report-all-above-energy-strategy-path-<mark>sustainable</mark>-economic-growth"" target=""_blank"">has also endorsed</A>, the congressman's voting record shows that he would do away with many Interior regulations for fossil fuel projects. </P><P>At first glance, Zinke is the slightly less predictable wildcard in Trump's cohort of oil barons. He's been known to champion ideals that even the greenest groups would applaud, but almost always with the caveat of benefiting his Montana's sportsmen, indigenous groups, and conservation community—constituents with whom he'd need to curry favor. However, his consistent pursuit of fossil fuel interests is likely to carry over into the Trump Administration. </P><P>&quot;A coal mine isn't a good place for duck hunting. Fracking wells tend to get in the way of a good time out with your kid,&quot; Henn said. &quot;We agree that public lands should be for public access. The distinction is that they should be protected, not leased out to the fossil fuel industry for a cent per acre.&quot; </P><P>If confirmed as Secretary of the Interior, Zinke, who <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-reportedly-picks-montana-congressman-ryan-zinke-for-interior-secretary/"" target=""_blank"">once</A> called himself &quot;a Teddy Roosevelt guy&quot; will decide the fate of Roosevelt's conservation legacy by overseeing America's national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges. His commitment to public lands will be evidenced by how he intends to use them. </P><P><B>Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy</B></P><DIV class=""article__media""><PICTURE class=""article__image""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 25em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/40553/1481914335514486.jpg?resize=400:*, https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/40553/1481914335514486.jpg?resize=600:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 40.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/40553/1481914335514486.jpg?resize=650:*, https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/40553/1481914335514486.jpg?resize=975:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 53.125em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/40553/1481914335514486.jpg?resize=850:*, https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/40553/1481914335514486.jpg?resize=1275:* 2x""><P class=""article__image-caption"">Image: <A href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/gageskidmore/5449935896/in/photolist-9iAm51-dq1Jqm-aqoLLX-dq1yie-btecYp-b3bCtx-b3byYt-axEFmP-axEGjg-axEG9a-b3bJ76-b3b5rk-9VqsYT-b3bryF-b3bouZ-axHoWo-axEGnz-axHotU-axHpeb-axHobC-axHoyh-9Vqhmw-9Vnrqt-9VqusK-9VthHh-9VquRk-9Vtm6b-9VqhPE-9VqicY-aqoWLg-e432Sh-e3Wphe-e3Wok2-e431vy-e42ZUu-e432vq-e3WnPz-e3WqC6-axHpjE-axHpgw-aqoYeX-b3b9uB-9Vtk8d-b3bbxn-aBDBBG-aBAWWc-aBAWMa-dq1yBF-9ixcZt-an7mV2"" target=""_blank"">Gage Skidmore/Flickr</A></P></SOURCE></SOURCE></SOURCE></PICTURE></DIV><P>While the others on this list have cynically used <mark>climate</mark> denial to earn their companies record profits or systematically dismantle and attack regulations, Rick Perry is uncomplicated, a caricature of standard Republican <mark>climate</mark> skepticism and denial. During his 2011 run for president, Trump's new Energy Secretary was called a &quot;straightforward <mark>climate</mark> science skeptic&quot; by <A href=""https://newrepublic.com/article/94198/why-right-wing-anti-science-matters"" target=""_blank""><I>The New Republic</I></A>. </P><P>While other potential cabinet members we've profiled here have made careers playing a Machiavellian game of <mark>climate</mark> denial chess, Perry is playing a much simpler game, perhaps <mark>climate</mark> denial Speak-N-Say, with each pull of the string leading him to say and do things that make him unfit to serve in any position of authority. </P><P>During his failed presidential run, Perry <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/29/opinion/republicans-against-science.html"" target=""_blank"">vowed to abolish the Department of Energy</A>, then forgot he'd made the promise. In April 2011, Perry officially proclaimed a statewide &quot;<A href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-gov-rick-perry-proclaims-days-of-prayer-for-rain/"" target=""_blank"">Days of Prayer for Rain in the State of Texas</A>&quot; in response to wildfires and drought that were ravaging the state in April 2011. The drought worsened for four months, and in September of that year, Perry and the conservative Texas legislature <A href=""https://www.texastribune.org/2011/04/08/texas-forest-service-battles-fires-budget-cuts/"" target=""_blank"">cut funding</A> for the agency tasked with battling the forest fires. </P><P>Perry's public statements on <mark>climate change</mark> are offensive and demonstrably false; in 2011, <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/29/opinion/republicans-against-science.html"" target=""_blank"">he said</A> he believes that &quot;there are a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling into their projects,&quot; and in his <A href=""http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2011/09/rick-perry-happily-grabs-anti-science-brass-ring"" target=""_blank"">2010 book</A> he noted that Earth is going through a &quot;cooling&quot; trend. He has, at times, turned this rhetoric into action. While he was Texas governor, Perry's administration <A href=""http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Professor-says-state-agency-censored-article-2211691.php"" target=""_blank"">censored scientific research</A> by deleting references to sea level rise and <mark>climate change</mark> from a paper it commissioned about environmental changes in Galveston Bay. </P><P>Unsurprisingly, Perry also has close ties to the fossil fuel industry. Perry is <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-energy-idUSKBN14316Q"" target=""_blank"">board director</A> of Energy Transfer Partners LP and Sunoco Logistics Partners LP, which are jointly trying to build the North Dakota Access Pipeline amid widespread protests from local Native American populations. </P><P>There is one incredibly important upshot here: The Department of Energy really has very little to do with fighting <mark>climate change</mark> and up until George W. Bush's presidency, had been run by run-of-the-mill politicians and bureaucrats, as opposed to scientists. This doesn't make Perry a <I>good</I> pick, but unless Trump significantly changes the general purview of the department, Perry's relationship with the oil industry is less concerning, than Tillerman's or Pruitt's. </P><P>The Department of Energy's main concern is managing and securing the country's stockpile of nuclear weapons and, to a lesser degree, managing the nation's nuclear power plants and cleaning up nuclear waste. Fun fact: The department does this with its National Nuclear Security Administration—the NNSA, not to be confused with the NSA. </P><P>The DOE is also in charge of the country's 17 national laboratories, which perform a whole host of important basic and applied physics and energy research. Of particular note and fame are Lawrence Livermore, Sandia, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Fermilab. The labs work on lasers, nuclear and fusion energy, new types of renewable energy, particle accelerator-type research, and the like. Also, one scientist as Fermilab is <A href=""http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-government-researchers-think-we-may-be-living-in-a-2d-hologram"">trying to determine if reality is actually a 2D hologram</A> (do not tell Donald Trump we are spending money on this). So far, 115 scientists working at or associated with the national labs <A href=""http://www.theintelligencer.com/news/article/Lesson-one-for-Rick-Perry-The-Energy-Department-10799928.php"" target=""_blank"">have won Nobel Prizes</A>. </P><P>The DOE's laboratories are highly respected on both sides of the aisle—much of its research finds its way into military technology, which Republicans like. It is possible that under an anti-science, anti-progress Trump administration, some labs shift focus to research clean coal and building a better oil rig in lieu of making <mark>sustainable</mark> energy advances or find themselves newly targeted as an area to be cut, but if it comes to that, we will certainly have bigger problems on our hands. </P><P class=""text-center"">* </P><P>All four men still need approval from the Senate to assume their respective roles. Environmental groups and progressive Democrats are planning their opposition strategy with hopes of blocking their confirmations. The reality of the situation, though, is that presidential nominations are often confirmed. It will require a concerted effort to block any one of these four nominations, and blocking all of them is unlikely. </P><P>This of course is part of the plan—if any one of these nominations are rejected, there's nothing to suggest that any subsequent one would be any better. With his team of anti-environment, oil friendly advisors, Trump will have wide latitude to destroy much of the <mark>climate</mark> progress made under Obama. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Ports and supply bases that could serve exploration campaigns or future fields in production will reduce overall costs.</P><P>Some of the blocks made available for oil companies in the maritime border area might actually cross the border itself. The delimitation agreement between Norway and Russia has a set of guidelines on how to share such possible cross-border resources under the seabed.</P><P>“We have had 12 expeditions in the border areas collecting environmental data. I’m sure this would be interesting for the Norwegians,” Millang suggests.</P><P>He admits synergies from shared operations and infrastructure will not come easy, or by itself. “There are different sets of rules and framework. How, as an example, could a Russian helicopter land on a Norwegian platform, etc.”</P><P>The head of <mark>Rosneft</mark>’s Norwegian subsidiary points to the North Sea where Norway and Great Britain for nearly five decades have drilled for oil, but where standards are still very different. “Taking a rig from the British sector to the Norwegian sector requires a set of modifications.”</P><P>While cross-border cooperation seems logically from a human resources-, technical and economical perspectives, current international political controversies make such ideas far out of the horizon.</P><P>Norway follows the European Union’s Russia-related sanctions; putting a ban on the possibilities Norwegian companies have to team-up with <mark>Rosneft</mark>’s oil drilling on Russia’s Arctic shelf.</P><P>Last month, the United States tightened the screws even more.</P><P>“The January 29th sanctions by the United States are designed to prohibit American companies to deal with Russian controlled companies.

It’s gratifying to see that <mark>Rosneft</mark> is getting recognition for its hard work because this project is important not only in reducing flaring and greenhouse gas emissions, but also for the positive impact it is having on the local environment surrounding oil fields and for making better use of precious resources.</P><P>In 2002 six major oil companies joined the World Bank in creating the GGFR, a public-private partnership to encourage the reduction of flaring of natural gas associated with oil production. Methane escapes when oil is extracted (oil and associated gas, or APG) and it’s usually flared, converting it into <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, because methane is 21 times worse for the environment than <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is. But still, it’s a large source of emissions and the gas can instead be refined and used as natural gas.</P><P>As global demand for petroleum increases, oil production at the Komsomolskoye oil field is only expected to increase, and with it, flaring. But if you install an APG booster compression station you can treat (dehydrate) the gas, clean it up and use it as natural gas. The installation of the booster compression station is expensive but by doing so, you are protecting the environment.  So in 2007, the World Bank, through its <A href=""http://www.<mark>carbon</mark>finance.org""><mark>Carbon</mark> Finance Unit</A>, and <mark>Rosneft</mark> started exploring the possibility of developing a Joint Implementation project under the Kyoto Protocol. The idea was that the project would lower its greenhouse gas emissions and thereby generate <mark>carbon</mark> credits.  From the beginning, <mark>Rosneft</mark> was very supportive of the project, despite investment costs of about US$60 million. In fact, the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> are pretty obvious to people at the site. A man, who had worked at the Komsomolskoye oil field for many years, told me that he could see the impact of a changing <mark>climate</mark> on the ground because he can now hear the chirping of small birds in the nearby forest during the summer. Twenty-five years earlier, the forest was silent since summer was shorter and too cold for birds to nest and have chicks.Due to extreme weather conditions at the project site between November and March, outdoor construction stops. In spite of this and some technical and operational challenges, the project was implemented successfully. It now reduces flaring of 1.3 million cubic meters of APG annually, translating into a reduction of one million tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide per year. It is also producing natural gas (which <mark>Rosneft</mark> sells to Gazprom), which decreases the need for natural gas production elsewhere. Perhaps more important for the people of Gubkinskiy nearby, it has also reduced emissions of soot, <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen oxide by an average of 72%. And because there is less flaring, there is now less thermal, light and noise <mark>pollution</mark> locally.   </P><P>With five years of project preparation under its belt, the <mark>Rosneft</mark> team has significantly enhanced its internal capacity to implement similar projects elsewhere. They have started several similar projects at other oil fields across Russia, and best practice on gas flaring reduction is spreading within the biggest oil company in the world.</P><P><STRONG>Related Information</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Barring legal prohibitions, Exxon and other public companies are duty-bound to put shareholder interests first.  </P><P>It's a reality that remains obscured as energy lobbyists and Congressional lawmakers campaign for sweeping policy shifts and controversial projects, such as construction of the Keystone XL oil import pipeline, fast-tracking natural gas export plants and removing limits on domestic oil exports.</P><P>Lately, politicians have used Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula to press for those changes. By allowing the unfettered export of U.S. natural gas and crude oil, they argue, we could free Europe and the Ukraine from their reliance of Russian supplies.</P><P>&quot;Why not export to friends and be a threat to Putin?&quot; By doing so, the United States can &quot;tell Russia to go stick it&quot; is how Michigan Congressman Fred Upton, chairman of the House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee, <A href=""http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Keystone-pipeline-Russians-Ukraine/2014/03/13/id/559428/"" target=""_blank"">put it earlier this year</A>. </P><P>But the truth is that the LNG and other export projects are not effective weapons for loosening Putin's energy stranglehold on Europe. Once LNG projects get approved, for instance, it takes years for them to start exporting. In addition, many of the U.S. LNG plant owners already have deals with Asian buyers, and they're unlikely to break those contracts to supply Europe. Finally, even though U.S. LNG exports could lower world prices, European buyers have to turn the LNG back into gas, making those supplies far more expensive than buying pipeline gas from nearby Russia.</P><P>&quot;Decisions about whom to export to and import from are made by commercial entities, not by governments,&quot; Michael Levi, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, <A href=""http://blogs.cfr.org/levi/2014/03/05/an-energy-weapon-vs-russia/"" target=""_blank"">wrote last March in an opinion piece called &quot;An Energy Weapon vs. Russia?</A>&quot;</P><P>Patriotism is simply not part of the culture at a multinational corporation like Exxon. Years ago, the company's then-chief executive Lee Raymond was asked about building more U.S. refineries to protect the economy and consumers from fuel shortages. Raymond's response, memorialized in a <A href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-18/book-review-private-empire-by-steve-coll"" target=""_blank"">book about Exxon by Steve Coll</A>, was this: &quot;I'm not a U.S. company, and I don't make decisions based on what's good for the U.S.&quot;</P><P>For Exxon, its shareholders and other energy companies, Russia's allure is a simple matter.</P><P>The country, already the world's top oil producer and the largest exporter of natural gas, has promising fossil fuel prospects in shale formations, heavy oil, the Arctic seas and elsewhere. That bounty has led to Russian deals with Exxon and most of its global brethren, including BP, Shell, Chevron, Eni (Italy), Total (France), Statoil (Norway), PSVSA (Venezuela), Petrobras (Brazil) and plenty of others.</P><P>They are all doing business with Russian oil and gas companies and Putin, the man House Speaker John Boehner has <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BygaY-2myQE"" target=""_blank"">called</A> a &quot;thug.&quot; BP even owns nearly 20 percent of <mark>Rosneft</mark>, the state-controlled oil company that is now subject to U.S. and European economic sanctions.</P><P>&quot;Vladimir Putin may not be politically correct these days, but he has a lot of oil and he probably isn't going away anytime soon,&quot; Daniel Jennings <A href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/2336545-exxonmobil-is-smart-to-stay-in-russia"" target=""_blank"">wrote</A> for the investment blog <A href=""http://seekingalpha.com/"" target=""_blank"">Seeking Alpha</A>. &quot;Making friends with Putin and sticking by him is a good business decision.&quot;</P><P>It's a tricky situation for Exxon, though, according to <A href=""http://www.amymyersjaffe.com/content/about.html"" target=""_blank"">Amy Myers Jaffe</A>, an expert on the energy geopolitics and executive director of the University of California Davis Program on Energy and Sustainability.</P><P>&quot;You're a multinational corporation, and your shareholders are paying you to do things that are profitable,&quot; Jaffe said in an interview. To that end, the company also wants to avoid provoking Putin into seizing Exxon assets in Russia.</P><P>&quot;But you still have to consider the image of the company...and it's not just about how does it look to the Congress or politicians who might go on CNN, it's also about what's your appetite for risks that might come to you for really sticking your neck out [for Russia]?&quot;</P><P><STRONG>ExxonMobil's Close Ties</STRONG></P><P>Exxon's links to Russia stretch back more than two decades, but in recent years, the relationship has grown beyond typical joint ventures into a long-term global partnership.</P><P>In 2011, the company and <mark>Rosneft</mark> signed a strategic cooperation agreement that included joint exploration and production in Russia, the United States and other parts of the world. That led to joint projects to extract hard-to-access oil in Siberia and export Russian LNG, the founding of an Arctic research center, and the targeting of 150 million acres in the arctic for joint development.</P><P>The two companies also share technology and expertise, and conduct staff exchanges for <mark>Rosneft</mark> and Exxon technical and management employees. In March 2013, a <mark>Rosneft</mark> subsidiary acquired a 20 percent stake in 20 Exxon prospects in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. </P><P>A few months later, Putin presented Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson with the <A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-04/putin-honors-exxon-s-tillerson-eni-s-scaroni-ex-stasi-warnig.html"" target=""_blank"">Order of Friendship award</A>.</P><P>All of that may put Exxon in an awkward spot—but it stands to profit from both sides of the dispute.  </P><P>So far, Western sanctions have not interfered with Exxon's projects with <mark>Rosneft</mark> and other Russian partners—though an Exxon spokesman said the latest sanctions are still under review. Barring changes on that front, the oil giant can continue with business-as-usual in Russia.</P><P>At the same time, Exxon can reap substantial benefits if the anti-Russia push in Washington helps bring about something U.S. oil and gas companies covet: Free rein to export domestic oil and liquefied natural gas. Recent streamlining of government review procedures have already boosted prospects for a domestic Exxon LNG project.</P><P>Here's a snapshot of the major energy-related developments in the Ukraine crisis and Exxon's Russian interactions since the conflict began:</P><UL><LI><P><STRONG>April 29, 2014</STRONG>—The United States accused the Kremlin of arming pro-Russia rebels in Ukraine and imposed sanctions on some of Putin's close allies, including <mark>Rosneft</mark> chief executive Igor Sechin. The move bars him from traveling to the U.S. and prohibits American citizens from doing business with him (not <mark>Rosneft</mark> itself, though).</P></LI></UL><UL><LI><P><STRONG>May 23, 2014</STRONG>—Putin hosts the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. Under pressure from the Obama Administration, PepsiCo, U.S. banks and others with interests in Russia skipped it. Attendance by Exxon and other energy companies &quot;salvaged what would have otherwise been an embarrassing event for the Kremlin,&quot; according to <A href=""http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Exxon-BP-Defy-White-House-Extend-Partnership-with-Russia.htm"">Oilprice.com</A>.</P><P>During the forum, Exxon signed an agreement with <mark>Rosneft</mark> to build an LNG terminal on Russia's pacific coast. BP signed a major shale exploration deal with <mark>Rosneft</mark> the following day. &quot;We are very pleased to be a part of [the] Russian energy complex,&quot; BP CEO Bob Dudley said at the event.</P></LI></UL><UL><LI><P><STRONG>May 26, 2014</STRONG>—Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson told reporters, &quot;There has been no impact on any of our business activities in Russia to this point, nor has there been any discernible impact on the relationship&quot; with <mark>Rosneft</mark>. Tillerson said he opposes sanctions, and that his views &quot;are being heard at the highest levels.&quot;</P></LI></UL><UL><LI><P><STRONG>Mid-July 2014</STRONG>—The United States imposed new sanctions that prohibit &quot;U.S. persons&quot; from providing new medium-term or long-term financing to two of Russia's major energy companies: <mark>Rosneft</mark>, Russia's largest petroleum company and OAO Novatek, the country's biggest independent natural gas producer. No new debt of longer than 90 days maturity.</P></LI></UL><UL><LI><P><STRONG>Aug. 9, 2014</STRONG>—Just weeks after the Obama Administration imposed sanctions on <mark>Rosneft</mark>, executives from Exxon and <mark>Rosneft</mark> appeared aboard an oil platform in the Arctic to celebrate the launch of exploratory drilling for a joint project worth billions. The platform is part of a 2013 agreement that predates the sanctions, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said.</P><P>Russian President Vladimir Putin, who participated via video link, applauded the accomplishment. &quot;In spite of the difficult current political situation, pragmatism and common sense still have the upper hand, and that is very gratifying,&quot; Putin told a bundled up Glenn Waller, president of Exxon Russia. &quot;ExxonMobil is our old, reliable partner, and we greatly value our relationship.&quot;</P></LI></UL><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

A move by BP into a Russian natural gas field gives Russian energy company <mark>Rosneft</mark> a lift in Chinese and Europe export efforts, an analyst said.</P><P>

Russian energy company <mark>Rosneft</mark> said Thursday it signed an agreement with the Russian division of BP to develop the natural gas reserves in the Kharampurskoe and Festivalnoye license areas in the north of the country. <mark>Rosneft</mark> estimates the region holds billions of oil-equivalent barrels in natural gas.</P><P>

<mark>Rosneft</mark> will hold a 51 percent stake in the region and market any of the oil and natural gas produced from Kharampurskoe and Festivalnoye. The Russian company said it was an important step forward in developing a global gas relationship with BP.</P><P>

Samuel Lussac, a research manager at consultant group Wood Mackenzie, said in emailed commentary that the field is &quot;at the heart&quot; of Russian gas ambitions. Production is expected to peak in the late 2020s.</P><P>

&quot;<mark>Rosneft</mark> continues to lobby for access to gas export markets, whether in China or Europe, and partnership with BP at Kharampurskoye will add further leverage to the company's efforts to secure export prices for its gas,&quot; he said.</P><P>

Russia has some of the largest natural gas reserves in the world and serves as one of the primary exporters to European and Asian economies. By company, Russian energy company Gazprom, co-owned by the government, is one of the main gas producers.</P><P>

Gazprom's 2018 plans include a variety of gas transmission pipelines, notably the Power of Siberia line for China and the doubling of the twin Nord Stream network crossing the Baltic Sea to the shores of Germany.</P><P>

European leaders in particular are wary of Russia's grip on the regional energy sector because companies like Gazprom control both the reserves and the transit networks. Nevertheless, an October report from RBC Capital Markets found companies like Gazprom and <mark>Rosneft</mark> have worked strategically to gain leverage in the global energy market by capitalizing on chaos.</P><P>

&quot;Moscow may yet close out 2017 as the preeminent energy super power,&quot; the report read.</P><P>

The United States, meanwhile, has said Russia is using its natural resources as a weapon, though the Kremlin said Washington is using diplomatic pressure as cover for its own energy ambitions in Europe and Asia.</P><P>

The Russian oil producer is a target of U.S. sanctions imposed after the government in Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine following upheaval in the former Soviet republic in 2014.</P><P>

BP CEO Bob Dudley served formerly as a top official at Russian joint venture TNK-BP before moving to the British major.</P><SPAN class=""BHB""><A href=""http://www.oilgasdaily.com/reports/Closures_maintenance_meant_Norway_produced_less_oil_and_gas_999.html"" class=""fullstory"">Closures, maintenance meant Norway produced less oil and gas</A></SPAN><SPAN class=""BDL"">Washington (UPI) Dec 20, 2017</SPAN><SPAN class=""BNTX"">

First, prior to the election, “most industry watchers had written off the chances of a foreign investor being found for <mark>Rosneft</mark>,” as Fortune <A href=""http://fortune.com/2016/12/08/russia-<mark>rosneft</mark>-qatar-glencore-oil/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">explained</A> at the time.

First, Schiff noted, “in early July, Carter Page, someone candidate Trump identified as one of his national security advisers, travels to Moscow on a trip approved by the Trump campaign.” He was nominally there to give “a speech critical of the United States and other Western countries.”</P><P>But, Schiff notes, “according to Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer who is reportedly held in high regard by U.S. Intelligence, Russian sources tell him that Page has also had a secret meeting with Igor Sechin, CEO of Russian gas giant <mark>Rosneft</mark>.” (Sechin is, as the UK Guardian puts it, Putin’s “<A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/11/trump-russia-dossier-explainer-details"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">de facto deputy</A>.”) Schiff notes that “according to Steele’s Russian sources, Page is offered brokerage fees by Sechin on a deal involving a 19 percent share of the company.”</P><DIV class=""ad-wrapper"" data-slot=""1""><DIV class=""ad-label"">Advertisement</DIV></DIV><P>Schiff explains that since this is a public hearing, his remarks are “drawn from public sources alone,” not all of which have been confirmed.</P><P>What makes Schiff’s concerns so salient now is that Putin <EM>did</EM> sell off 19.5 percent of <mark>Rosneft</mark> in early December and that, as Reuters reported, “it still isn’t possible to determine from public records the full identities of those who bought it.”</P><P>No FBI investigation into collusion can possibly be considered complete if it can’t determine the full slate of buyers—and whether any of them are connected to Trump officials or the Trump business empire.</P><H4>Follow the money</H4><P>Any examination of the <mark>Rosneft</mark> sale should start by looking at the 2014 deal between Exxon and <mark>Rosneft</mark>, valued at $500 billion, and eventually killed by sanctions imposed by the Obama administration.</P><DIV class=""ad-wrapper"" data-slot=""2""><DIV class=""ad-label"">Advertisement</DIV></DIV><P>That deal would have married ExxonMobil, with its expertise in Arctic drilling, to <mark>Rosneft</mark>, Russia’s state-owned (i.e. Putin-controlled) oil giant, with its vast reserves in inhospitable locations. Coincidentally, it was then-Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson (now Trump’s Secretary of State) who negotiated the deal with Putin and Sechin. Tillerson’s rise as Exxon’s ‘Russia czar’ happened to coincide with the rise in power of both Putin and Sechin—and their successful <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<mark>Rosneft</mark>"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">kleptocratic efforts</A> to expand <mark>Rosneft</mark>.</P><FIGURE class=""post__figure post__figure--format-title-width""><FIGCAPTION>Russia’s $500 billion oil deal with Exxon was killed by U.S. sanctions.

Suddenly, the Kremlin had a half-trillion-dollar motive to elect someone who would end the sanctions.</P><P>Since the election, we’ve learned that key members of Trump’s campaign team—<A href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-kislyak-russia_us_58bf087ee4b0e6e6ccb56870?ks0x2e97iy3ng3c8fr&amp;"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">including Trump himself</A>—met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, while denying publicly that they had. In particular, Trump’s national security adviser Michael Flynn was forced to resign after it turned out he talked with Kislyak about softening the sanctions. CNN <A href=""http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/02/world/sergey-kislyak-russian-ambassador-us-profile/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">notes that</A>“current and former U.S. intelligence officials have described Kislyak as a top spy and recruiter of spies.”</P><P>Another key development since the election: Putin pulled off the <mark>Rosneft</mark> sale in December. When <A href=""http://fortune.com/2016/12/08/russia-<mark>rosneft</mark>-qatar-glencore-oil/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Fortune reported</A> on this deal, they pointed out that it was “confounding expectations that the Kremlin’s standoff with the West would scare off major investors.”</P><DIV class=""ad-wrapper"" data-slot=""3""><DIV class=""ad-label"">Advertisement</DIV></DIV><P>But this deal “pointed to a possible reassessment by foreign investors of the risks of dealing with Russia, at a time when the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president has heightened expectations of a thaw between Moscow and Washington.”</P><P>Significantly, the $11 billion raised by the sale went to the Kremlin, not <mark>Rosneft</mark>. No wonder “Russian officials were jubilant that <mark>Rosneft</mark> had pulled off a deal which will deliver a large chunk of the cash they need to fill gaps in the state budget caused by an economic slowdown and sanctions,”<A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-<mark>rosneft</mark>-privatisation-idUSKBN13W2QG"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">as Reuters</A> reported.</P><P>Kleptocracy—and possibly meddling with a foreign election—looks like it pays very well for team Putin.</P><P>As for the buyers, Sergey Aleksashenko, a former deputy head of Russia’s central bank, <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-<mark>rosneft</mark>-privatisation-insight-idUSKBN1582OH"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">wrote</A> in a blog post earlier this year, “the main question in relation to this transaction, as ever, still sounds like this: Who is the real buyer of a 19.5 percent stake in <mark>Rosneft</mark>?”</P><P>Reuters notes that “important facts about the deal either have not been disclosed, cannot be determined solely from public records, or appear to contradict the straightforward official account of the stake being split 50/50” between Swiss oil trading firm Glencore and the Qataris. The funding sources for almost a quarter of the deal “have not been disclosed by any of the parties.”</P><P>This deal “uses a structure of shell companies owning shell companies, commonly referred to in Russia as a ‘matryoshka,’ after the wooden nesting dolls that open to reveal a smaller doll inside.” For instance, “public records show the ownership structure of the stake ultimately includes a Cayman Islands company whose beneficial owners cannot be traced.”</P><P>Unnesting all of the dolls and figuring out the full identities of the buyers should be a top priority for the FBI’s collusion investigation and anyone in the media who wants to <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follow_the_money"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">follow the money</A> of this ever-growing scandal.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In particular, these sanctions – imposed by Barack Obama, supported by Hillary Clinton, and repeatedly questioned by Donald Trump and Rex Tillerson – are blocking a lucrative long-term oil agreement between Russia and ExxonMobil, a deal whose value is underscored by a little-noticed 1988 declassified <SPAN class=""caps"">CIA</SPAN> document.</P><P>As law enforcement and congressional investigations go forward, a key issue is whether there were pre-election discussions between the Putin and Trump camps involving the possible lifting of these sanctions, just as Russia was seeking to influence the election in Trump’s favor.</P><P>The apparent hook for Flynn’s multiple phone calls with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak was Obama’s December 29 imposition of new sanctions against Russia, penalties imposed in the wake of <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> intelligence findings that Russia had aimed to tilt the election to Trump by hacking emails and spreading disinformation. Although transcripts of the calls from intelligence community intercepts have not been publicly released, the <EM>Washington Post</EM><A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-adviser-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-despite-denials-officials-say/2017/02/09/f85b29d6-ee11-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html?utm_term=.349abfd3cadb"">reported</A> that some senior <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> officials interpret Flynn’s words as signaling that Moscow could expect a lessening of the sanctions. Thereafter, Putin announced that Russia would not impose retaliatory sanctions, a decision that Trump then praised on Twitter.</P><P>But the scope of those December sanctions are small potatoes compared with other penalties already in place prior to the election: the <A href=""https://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/ukrainerussia/"">2014 sanctions</A> that the <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> imposed after Russia’s military annexation of Crimea and other abuses in Ukraine. Those sanctions penalize numerous companies and individuals in Putin’s inner circle, as well as key Russian banks and energy companies, and block U.S oil companies, including Exxon, from working on Russian oil and gas drilling joint ventures.
 </P><H3><STRONG>The Russia-Exxon Deal</STRONG></H3><P>Perhaps the biggest deal that the <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> sanctions shut down was the remarkable 2011 <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/world/europe/rex-tillersons-company-exxon-has-billions-at-stake-over-russia-sanctions.html?_r=0"">agreement</A> that Putin and <mark>Rosneft</mark>, Russia’s state oil company, brokered with Exxon and its <SPAN class=""caps"">CEO</SPAN>, Rex Tillerson. The two sides called the agreement a “Strategic Partnership.” The plum in this <A href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/13/exxon-mobil-could-tap-huge-arctic-assets-if-us-russian-relations-thaw.html"">deal</A>, potentially worth hundreds of billions of dollars, was new exploration for offshore oil and gas in the Russian Arctic. (The drilling deal was facilitated by global warming that has <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/exxon-makes-billion-dollar-bet-<mark>climate</mark>-change-is-real-here-now-and-going-to-get-worse-but-keeps-e5e31ddca18c#.odle3brkr"">melted Arctic ice</A>; some have asked whether Exxon was sharing with <mark>Rosneft</mark> its knowledge and modelling of accelerating <mark>climate change</mark>, even as it continued to <A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/exxon-and-the-oil-industry-knew-about-<mark>climate</mark>-change/exxons-<mark>climate</mark>-denial-history-a-timeline/"">fund efforts to conceal</A> the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> from the American people.)</P><P>This deal is made even more interesting by a <A href=""https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000498653.pdf"">1988 <SPAN class=""caps"">CIA</SPAN> secret report</A>, since declassified, on the Kara Sea, the very location where Exxon and <mark>Rosneft</mark> were planning their major offshore operations. The Kara Sea, the <SPAN class=""caps"">CIA</SPAN> stated, “could become one of the major petroleum regions in the <SPAN class=""caps"">USSR</SPAN> early in the next century.” But the agency judged that development was unlikely without joint ventures with Western oil companies.</P><P>Twenty-three years later, Exxon stepped into the very role the <SPAN class=""caps"">CIA</SPAN> predicted.</P><P>Oil and gas revenue has accounted for upwards of 70 percent of Russia’s export income and <A href=""https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i8TRkfzZ_OKY/v2/-1x-1.png"">40 to 50 percent</A> of the Russian budget over the past decade. A glut of oil on the global market has crashed oil prices and tanked the Russian economy in the last few years. Nonetheless, Russia is now second to the United States in oil and gas production, and only the <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> fracking boom of the past 5 years puts the U.S in the lead. And in brokering the Russian deal, Exxon promised to <A href=""http://business.financialpost.com/news/energy/exxon-fracking-siberia-to-help-putin-maintain-oil-clout"">teach <mark>Rosneft</mark> to frack</A>, with made-in-America technology and equipment.</P><P>The Russian Arctic alone is said to hold upwards of 90 billion barrels of oil. And <mark>Rosneft</mark> has exclusive access, granted by Putin. The <mark>Rosneft</mark> deal was also <A href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/13/exxon-mobil-could-tap-huge-arctic-assets-if-us-russian-relations-thaw.html"">crucial for Exxon’s future</A>, allowing it to book massive reserves unavailable elsewhere on earth, before the sanctions shut it all down.  </P><P>One might ask how allowing this deal to proceed would help the United States anywhere except at Exxon headquarters. But the deal has the potential to make Russia great again.  
 </P><H3><STRONG>Trump and the Russia Sanctions</STRONG></H3><P>Now Putin and Exxon have a potential savior in Donald Trump. Candidate Trump promised in July that he “<A href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trump-crimea-sanctions-russia-226292"">would be looking into</A>” recognizing Crimea as part of Russia and lifting the Obama sanctions. A few days later Trump <A href=""http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/trump-crimeas-people-prefer-russia-elected-putin-ukraine/story?id=41029437"">told an interviewer</A> that “the people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia.”</P><P>Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, had <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/hillary-clinton-says-vladimir-putins-crimea-occupation-echoes-hitler"">compared Putin’s intervention</A> in Crimea to Adolph Hitler’s aggression and called for maintaining and indeed strengthening <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> sanctions against Moscow.</P><P>On January 16, president-elect Trump returned to the subject, saying he might propose a deal under which the <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> would end its Crimea sanctions if Russia agreed to a nuclear arms agreement. “Russia’s hurting very badly right now because of sanctions,” <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-arms-deal-idUSKBN14Z0YE"">Trump said</A>, “but I think something can happen that a lot of people are gonna benefit.”</P><P>Buttressing the idea that Trump has been preparing to lift the Russia sanctions was his choice for secretary of state: Rex Tillerson, who had no diplomatic or government experience but who spent 41 years at Exxon. In pursuing the arctic drilling deal, Tillerson developed <A href=""https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2016/12/21/295592/moscow-on-the-potomac/"">strong personal ties</A> to <mark>Rosneft</mark> head Igor Sechin, an ex-<SPAN class=""caps"">KGB</SPAN> agent close to Putin. In 2012, Russia awarded Tillerson one of its highest honors, the Order of Friendship decoration. Despite Tillerson’s <A href=""http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/11/14237748/tillerson-exxon-russia-lobbying"">denials</A> at his confirmation hearing, <A href=""http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2014/Q2/300667995.xml"">Exxon lobbied</A> against Obama’s 2014 <A href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/exxon-mobile-russia-sanctions-rex-tillerson-232770"">sanctions</A>, which included penalties on <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/28/<mark>rosneft</mark>-chairman-us-sanctions-bp"">Sechin personally</A>. Tillerson thereafter told his shareholders that Exxon generally <A href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rex-tillerson-trumps-pick-secretary-state/story?id=44112481"">opposed</A><SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> sanctions as ineffective. (Tillerson’s former colleagues at Exxon will now also benefit from a <A href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/davidhalperin/trump-tillerson-exxon-ame_b_14575170.html"">range of Trump policies</A> that favor oil and gas interests.)</P><P>Now there is evidence that Trump associates from outside the administration have been actively pushing the White House to end the sanctions. On Sunday, the <EM>New York Times </EM><A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/us/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-russia.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news"">reported</A> that Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s long-time personal lawyer at the Trump organization, hand-delivered to Flynn, the week before he resigned, a proposal for a Russia-Ukraine peace deal that includes lifting the <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> sanctions. The plan was endorsed by Cohen, Felix Sater, a Russian-American businessman with longstanding connections to Trump, and a Ukrainian opposition politician.</P><P>To be sure, there are <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/why-putin-wants-a-trump-victory-so-much-he-might-even-be-trying-to-help-him/2016/08/17/897ab21c-6495-11e6-be4e-23fc4d4d12b4_story.html?utm_term=.7cd547e3cf6f"">reasons</A> besides the sanctions that Putin might have wanted to help Trump win: Trump lacked Hillary Clinton’s national security and government experience and thus was potentially a weaker adversary; Trump was calling into question <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> alliances and commitments overseas, including <SPAN class=""caps"">NATO</SPAN>; and Trump repeatedly expressed personal admiration for Putin.</P><P>But the chance to rescue the flagging Russian economy certainly would have loomed large for the Kremlin leader.</P><H3><STRONG>The Trump Camp’s Russia Ties</STRONG></H3><P>Meanwhile, Trump not only was the potential beneficiary of this aggressive Russian interference in the <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> election; he actively cheered it on during the campaign, endlessly praising the leaking of Democrats’ emails, quoting from those messages, and calling on Russia to hack into Hillary Clinton’s server to “find the 30,000 emails that are missing.”</P><P>There is plenty of evidence of engagement between the Trump camp and Russia. Flynn, who was Trump’s campaign advisor before briefly serving as his White House national security adviser, has <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/mike-flynn-resign-pence-russia.html"">significant ties to Russian interests</A>, as do Trump advisers <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/trump-russia-associates-investigation.html"">Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and Roger Stone</A>.

In return, Page had expressed interest and confirmed that were Trump elected <SPAN class=""caps"">US</SPAN> president, then sanctions on Russia would be lifted.”)</P><P>Reuters <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-cyber-idUSKBN15X0OE"">reported</A> over the weekend  that the <SPAN class=""caps"">FBI</SPAN> is examining “financial transactions by Russian individuals and companies who are believed to have links to Trump associates.” And the <EM>New York Times</EM><A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/russia-intelligence-communications-trump.html"">reported</A> last week that calls intercepted by <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> intelligence calls show that Trump associates and campaign officials “had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election.” Meanwhile, two days after the election, the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei A. Ryabkov, <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/moscow-had-contacts-with-trump-team-during-campaign-russian-diplomat-says/2016/11/10/28fb82fa-a73d-11e6-9bd6-184ab22d218e_story.html?utm_term=.b928568f6e77"">said</A> “there were contacts” between Russian officials and Trump’s team during the campaign. “Obviously,” Ryabkov added, “we know most of the people from his entourage.” Obviously.</P><P>At his press conference on Thursday, Trump flatly denied that he had any financial connections to Russia, <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-business.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0"">despite</A> the <A href=""http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/12/19/the-curious-world-of-donald-trumps-private-russian-connections/"">extensive evidence</A> that he does. He added that “nobody that I know of” from his campaign talked with Russian officials during the campaign. But as to whether <A href=""http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/who-told-flynn-to-call-russia-214782"">Flynn</A> discussed the sanctions with Kislyak in December, Trump said, “It would have been okay with me… I would have directed him if I thought he wasn’t doing it.”</P><P>Thus the signs of a possible arrangement: The Trump and Putin camps are acquainted. Putin helps Trump become president. Trump ends the sanctions that are holding back Putin’s economy, especially the Exxon-<mark>Rosneft</mark> deal.

The conservative Frum was famous for authoring Bush’s controversial “<A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_evil#David_Frum"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">axis of evil</A>” speech about the danger posed by Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.</P><P>But it appears our democracy and our children have a new axis to worry about: <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/trump-putin-and-exxonmobil-team-up-to-destroy-the-planet-fb88650acfa1#.u0nibpg9a"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Putin, Trump, and ExxonMobil</A>, whose CEO Rex Tillerson—an <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/trump-picks-exxonmobil-ceo-to-be-americas-next-secretary-of-state-121d0dfef757#.9feb2qi21"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">extreme Russophile</A> and long-time director of a <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/18/leak-rex-tillerson-director-bahamas-based-us-russian-oil-company?CMP=edit_2221"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">US-Russian oil company</A>—is Trump’s puzzling choice for Secretary of State.</P><DIV class=""ad-wrapper"" data-slot=""0""><DIV class=""ad-label"">Advertisement</DIV></DIV><P>I say “puzzling” because the long-serving Exxon employee (from age 23!) has <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/exxon-ceo-trump-worst-nominee-for-<mark>climate</mark>-40c00f67ccfe#.3me0di2d1"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">no qualifications</A> to be secretary of state—other than a history negotiating major oil deals with countries like Putin’s Russia, which in any sane world would actually disqualify him or at least force a recusal from all State Department dealings with Russia.</P><P>But that puzzle disappears if we follow the famous dictum from the Watergate era for uncovering a tangled web of covert campaign acts: “Follow the money.” And perhaps another puzzle is also solved: Why did Putin take such a “fearful risk,” as Frum put it, to “mount a clandestine espionage and disinformation campaign on behalf” of Trump and against Clinton, “when Putin had every reason to expect that he probably <EM>would</EM> end up facing a President Clinton,” and a tremendous backlash.</P><P>You can certainly make a plausible case, as U.S. intelligence agencies do in their <A href=""https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3254237/Russia-Hack-Report.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">bombshell new report</A>, that Putin had plenty of motivation to interfere. He wanted to undermine the legitimacy of U.S. elections and a Clinton Presidency, he blamed Secretary Clinton for “inciting mass protests against his regime,” and he was angry with the U.S. for the <A href=""https://panamapapers.icij.org/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Panama Papers</A> leaks. Those leaks showed a $2 billion trail of offshore accounts and deals that traced back to Putin and his cabal of kleptocrats, who, among other things, were getting rich “<A href=""https://www.ft.com/content/31d99184-fa66-11e5-8f41-df5bda8beb40"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">trading shares in <mark>Rosneft</mark>,</A>” Russia’s state-owned (i.e. Putin run) oil monopoly.</P><P>But a half trillion dollars to line their pockets and prop up the Russian economy offers a much more tangible motivation for team Putin to get Trump elected. And it was Tillerson who had made the <A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-candidate-for-state-has-close-ties-to-vladimir-putin-1481033938"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">$500 billion oil deal</A> with Putin that got <A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/sanctions-over-ukraine-put-exxon-at-risk-1410477455"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">blocked by sanctions</A>.</P><DIV class=""ad-wrapper"" data-slot=""1""><DIV class=""ad-label"">Advertisement</DIV></DIV><P>Blocking the deal did not just “put Exxon at risk,” as the Wall Street Journal <A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/sanctions-over-ukraine-put-exxon-at-risk-1410477455"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">reported</A> in 2014.

And Trump’s election already appears to have delivered $11 billion to the Kremlin through sale of a 19.5 percent stake in <mark>Rosneft</mark>, “confounding expectations that the Kremlin’s standoff with the West would scare off major investors,” as <A href=""http://fortune.com/2016/12/08/russia-<mark>rosneft</mark>-qatar-glencore-oil/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Fortune has reported</A> in a must-read piece.</P><P>Kleptocracy—and interfering with our election—pays.</P><P>So that’s why it matters so much what Trump and his cabinet do in response to the overwhelming evidence that Putin did clandestinely interfere in the election. Conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/01/08/trump-must-prove-putins-assessment-wrong/?utm_term=.58cbd7b01509"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">writes</A> that if Trump doesn’t aggressively go after Putin, including working with “Congress to pass a stiff sanctions package,” and instead “sticks with Putin, he’ll have proved Putin and Trump’s critics right—he really is a patsy for Putin.”</P><DIV class=""ad-wrapper"" data-slot=""2""><DIV class=""ad-label"">Advertisement</DIV></DIV><P>Indeed, if Trump and Tillerson instead end the sanctions that are blocking the Exxon-Rossneft deal, it is going to look suspiciously like a half trillion dollar quid pro quo for Putin’s help getting elected.</P><P>And if Trump and Tillerson work together to kill the Paris <mark>climate</mark> deal, the last best chance to save Americans from catastrophic <mark>climate change</mark>—and a <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/trump-terrible-deal-maker-<mark>climate</mark>-83ea3c16f68a#.bdsjoxgol"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">ridiculously good deal for the U.S.</A>— that will look like they are putting Putin’s interests and Exxon’s profits above America’s national interest and the health and well-being of our children.

The leak occurred last week just outside Nefteyugansk, a major oil town near the Ob river in the Khanty-Mansiysk region of Siberia, and quickly contaminated several hectares of water in the area, which has been suffering from flooding. The leak had been stopped as of Monday, the watchdog said.</P><P>A regional prosecutor is investigating the company’s actions to prevent accidents and to clean up after the spill.</P><P>Although the spill is only one of thousands that happen across the oil-exporting country’s ageing pipeline infrastructure each year, it’s proximity to the city of 120,000 has made it particularly visible. More than 10,000 oil leaks have been reported in Russia in previous years, and the Hydrometeorological Centre of Russia estimates 4.5m tonnes of oil are spilled on the Russian mainland each year, or <A href=""http://europe.newsweek.com/russia-need-not-drill-arctic-if-it-repairs-oil-pipeline-leaks-321372"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">seven times more than the BP Deepwater Horizon spill</A> in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. </P><P>“The fact that it’s in Nefteyugansk is a good reason to change a system that is designed not to protect the environment but rather to favour oil companies, the system for following up on oil spills,” said Yevgeniya Belyakova, Arctic project coordinator at <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greenpeace"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Greenpeace</A> Russia.</P><P>According to the environmental oversight agency, the pipeline leak started on 23 June 1km (0.6 miles) outside Nefteyugansk, releasing oil into the Cheuskin channel, part of the intricate network of rivers and streams ultimately connected to the Ob. A film of oil 1mm thick formed over a four-hectare area, although the “exact extent of the contamination, as well as the environmental damage, are being determined”, it said in a statement. Previous estimates put the contamination at 10 hectares or more.</P><FIGURE itemprop=""associatedMedia image"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/ImageObject"" data-component=""image"" class=""element element-image img--portrait  "" data-media-id=""3abed1c7f2dc49bf9cbbda0854e87f80550c731c""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption caption--img caption caption--img"" itemprop=""description""> Locals have uploaded photographs of oily water in their backyards and sinks.

The company told RBC newspaper it had deployed 60 people and eight pieces of equipment to clean up the spill, and said the oil did not pose a threat of flowing into the nearby Yuganskaya branch of the major Ob river.</P><P>Warning that oil could get into people’s basements and release fumes over an extended period, Belyakova called the leak a catastrophe, one which pointed to a larger problem. After the government assesses the damage from a spill, oil companies are given a choice to pay a fine or clean up the contamination, with minimal oversight of the “recultivation” programme they draw up and carry out in the affected area, she said.</P><P>“The problem is the system of control over oil drilling and how resource-extraction companies conduct themselves,” she said. “Leaking oil is simpler and less expensive than to fix infrastructure, [and] take measures so that there aren’t spills.”</P><P>According to Belyakova, most of the oil pipelines near Nefteyugansk are Soviet-built and prone to leaks. Greenpeace <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Russia</A> had observed an oil leak contaminating 4 sq km at the nearby Mamontovskoye oil field that has been growing for the past 11 years, she added.</P><DIV class=""submeta""><SPAN class=""submeta__label"">Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Oil and gas giant ExxonMobil stands to gain nearly $1 trillion from Trump administration policies, according to a new report from the left-leaning Center for American Progress. </P><P> The report, titled &quot;How Exxon Won the 2016 Election,&quot; details how the energy and environmental policies of Trump's Cabinet picks could benefit Exxon, the eighth-largest company in the world and the largest of the world's six Big Oil companies. </P><P> The CEO of Exxon and Trump's pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, will be grilled in a Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday about the <A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/rex-tillerson-trump-secretary-of-state-romney-2016-12"" target=""_blank"">potential conflicts of interests he faces</A> as a result of his company's extensive global operations. The company produces oil and gas in 22 countries, and Tillerson owns company shares worth $180 million, according to the report. </P><P> Tillerson has promised to sever ties with Exxon if he is confirmed by the Senate, <A href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2017/01/04/secretary-of-state-appointee-rex-tillerson-reaches-180-million-severance-deal-with-exxon/#7fd3cf2871f8""> in exchange for a payout</A> that matches the value of his shares. But he is also likely to face questions about his personal ties to Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, whom the US intelligence community <A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/us-intelligence-russian-hacking-report-putin-trump-2017-1"" target=""_blank"">said last week ordered an &quot;influence campaign&quot;</A> aimed at diminishing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during the presidential election. </P><P> Tillerson, whose relationship with the Kremlin dates back to the early 1990s, has struck several major deals with the Russian state-run corporation <mark>Rosneft</mark> and received the prestigious Order of Friendship award from Putin in 2013. </P><P> In 2014, Exxon was on the brink of signing a lucrative deal with <mark>Rosneft</mark> to drill for oil in the Russian Arctic when the US leveled sanctions against Russia for annexing Crimea and invading eastern Ukraine. The Obama administration sanctioned Russia again late last month for its meddling in the presidential election. </P><P><FIGURE id=""img-862634"" class=""figure image-figure-image image-figure-float-right float-md-right postload"" data-type=""img"" data-e2e-name=""image-figure-image"" data-media-container=""image"" style=""""><SPAN class=""image-source-caption""><FIGCAPTION class=""image-caption"" data-e2e-name=""image-caption"">In this photo taken June 21, 2012, Russian President Vladimir Putin presents ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson with a Russian medal at an award ceremony of heads and employees of energy companies at the St. Petersburg economic forum in St. Petersburg, Russia.</FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""image-source"" data-e2e-name=""image-source"">

The head of the company's operations in Russia, Glenn Waller, <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-exxon-mobil-arctic-idUSKCN0XG1VP""> said last April</A> that the company will return to its joint project with <mark>Rosneft</mark> once sanctions against Moscow are lifted. </P><P> Exxon would also benefit from the likely reversal of the Obama administration's executive order requiring a presidential permit to construct cross-border pipelines. The construction of additional pipelines —<A href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/trudeau-pipelines-kinder-morgan-trans-mountain-calgary-1.3905846""> supported by</A> Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — would facilitate the mining and transportation of Canadian tar sands, which make up <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/12122016/exxon-<mark>climate</mark>-change-investigation-tar-sands-oil-development-canada""> more than one-third</A> of Exxon's global liquid reserves. The reserves are worth roughly $277 billion at current oil prices, the CAP report estimated. </P><P> Trump's pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, has sued the agency multiple times to prevent rules that would curb air and water <mark>pollution</mark> from taking effect. </P><P> Pruitt <A href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/11/<mark>climate</mark>-deniers-trump-administration""> has opposed</A> the EPA's Clean Air and Clean Power acts, arguing that energy regulation should be left to individual states. Exxon, like any oil company, would likely benefit from the relaxation or elimination of anti-<mark>pollution</mark> laws that have often required companies to invest in research and technology to make their operations safer and more efficient. </P><P> Trump's pick to lead the Department of Energy (DOE), former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, has received more than $5 million in contributions from the oil and gas industry, the CAP report said, including <A href=""http://info.tpj.org/reports/pdf/PerryRGACrossOver.pdf"">$40,000 directly</A> from Exxon. Perry said during a 2011 run for president that he wanted to eliminate the DOE — which, among many other things, regulates fracking and offshore drilling. </P><P><FIGURE id=""img-447061"" class=""figure image-figure-image  postload"" data-type=""img"" data-e2e-name=""image-figure-image"" data-media-container=""image"" style=""""><SPAN class=""image-source-caption""><FIGCAPTION class=""image-caption"" data-e2e-name=""image-caption"">Texas governor Rick Perry, Trump's pick to lead the Energy Department, has received more than $5 million in contributions from the oil and gas industry.</FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""image-source"" data-e2e-name=""image-source"">

Those policies, the CAP report suggested, will increase oil demand and drive up oil prices, which are &quot;the single largest determining factor in Exxon's profitability each year.&quot; </P><P> Exxon may yield influence over the Justice Department, too, which will be led by Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions if he is confirmed by the Senate. As attorney general, Sessions would be able to put a definitive end to calls for Exxon to be investigated for <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-07/will-exxonmobil-have-to-pay-for-misleading-the-public-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change""> allegedly knowing about the dangers of <mark>climate change</mark> as early as the 19 70s</A>, but failing to disclose them to the public. </P><P> Under Tillerson, the company became more accepting of evolving <mark>climate change</mark> science. But such an investigation could end up setting the company back anywhere from $84 billion to $246 billion in settlement costs or fines. </P><P> In 2016, Sessions and four other Republican senators <A href=""http://dailycaller.com/2016/05/26/senators-demand-doj-stop-investigating-global-warming-skeptics/""> wrote a letter</A> to Attorney General Loretta Lynch asking her to &quot;immediately cease&quot; the investigation into Exxon, which they said confirmed that the government was trying &quot;to silence debate on <mark>climate change</mark>.&quot; </P><P> It is unclear how much Exxon's lobbying influence would have been quelled by a Clinton administration, however. The Clinton Global Initiative has received between <A href=""https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%241%2C000%2C001+to+%245%2C000%2C000""> $1 million and $5 million</A> from the oil company, according to its website. And as <A href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/05/10/hillary-clinton-s-oily-exxon-connections.html""> The Daily Beast</A> noted in May, Ursula Burns, a member of the company's board of directors, gave the Clinton campaign the maximum contribution of $5,400. </P><P><FIGURE id=""img-911640"" class=""figure image-figure-image  postload"" data-type=""img"" data-e2e-name=""image-figure-image"" data-media-container=""image"" style=""""><SPAN class=""image-source-caption""><FIGCAPTION class=""image-caption"" data-e2e-name=""image-caption"">Hillary Clinton conceded the presidential election at the New Yorker Hotel on November 9.</FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""image-source"" data-e2e-name=""image-source"">

For nine months, the crisis-stricken oil major had been weathering the US fallout from the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which killed 11 workers and caused the largest oil spill in history.</P><P>BP had lost almost half its value on the stock market.

</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P> Dudley had run BP’s Russian joint venture for years and knew better than anyone the risks and rewards in the booming hydro<mark>carbon</mark> superpower. On 14 January, the BP boss agreed a bold share swap deal with Putin’s state-controlled <mark>Rosneft</mark>.</P><P>It was a deal that stunned the business world, revealing BP’s determination to reinvent itself with a new centre of gravity to the east. It was again perceived as a global force on the world stage, and its shares hit their highest level since the disaster.</P><P> Environmentalists, though, were infuriated. Once at the vanguard of efforts to migrate to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> world “Beyond Petroleum”, BP was now hitching its wagon to Putin’s controversial state-controlled oil giant, a business racing to dominate fossil fuel riches beneath Arctic — and dismissive of western <mark>climate change</mark> warnings.</P><P>Whatever <mark>climate change</mark> rhetoric might have been aired before or since, this was serious. In BP’s hour of need, like so often before, the British government sprung forward with its official blessing.</P><P> “You cannot move to a low <mark>carbon</mark> economy overnight,” said the then energy minister Chris Huhne after the hastily arranged signing ceremony on that damp, dark Friday evening at BP’s head office in London’s St James’s Square. “This is a very key British player which happens to be a fundamental part of almost everybody’s pension fund.”</P><P>“BP, as we all know, is coming out of a difficult period in its history. This partnership shows BP is very much open for business.” </P><P>Yet it was only three years since Dudley had fallen out spectacularly with the Russian establishment, fleeing Moscow in the face of what he claimed was “sustained harassment” and going into semi-hiding.</P><P>Leaked US diplomatic cables revealed how Dudley had been whispering to American officials, accusing Igor Sechin, Putin ally and <mark>Rosneft</mark> boss, of supporting a “black PR” campaign against him. Another US cable recorded many observers “believe [Sechin] was behind … attacks on TNK-BP”. TNK-BP was the BP joint venture Dudley had run.</P><P>The eventual BP-<mark>Rosneft</mark> tie-up was to be cast on slightly altered terms than initially planned — BP sold its Russian joint venture and took cash and a 19.75% stake in <mark>Rosneft</mark>. But this was the UK giant pointing to its future.</P><P> When Vladimir Putin was asked why he had chosen to link up with a company so recently tainted by the Gulf of Mexico disaster, he reached for a suitably muscular Russian proverb: “One man who’s been beaten is worth two who haven’t.” In Washington, there was outrage. “BP once stood for British Petroleum. With this deal, it now stands for Bolshoi Petroleum,” spluttered Ed Markey, senior Democrat on the House of Representatives’ natural resources committee.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It's a big challenge - not least for the region's vulnerable ecosystems.</P><DIV class=""group""><DIV class=""longText""><P> Some 13 percent of the world's untapped oil reserves and almost a third of untapped gas reservoirs are estimated to be stored in the Arctic - a region that was long deemed inaccessible to the machinery needed to extract the resources.</P><P> But since <mark>climate change</mark> has caused sea ice to melt, there has been a virtual oil rush by the industry's giants to tap these reserves. Rising oil prices and the desire to be independent from oil imports are adding to a growing wish to extract new sources of energy.</P><P><STRONG>Cooperation in the cold instead of 'Cold War'</STRONG></P><P> An agreement between Russian state group <mark>Rosneft</mark> and BP was cancelled last year. After a year of negotiations, <mark>Rosneft</mark> signed a deal Monday with American giant Exxon, agreeing to concessions in the field of energy taxes and tariffs.</P><P> &quot;Experts describe the project as just as ambitious as manned space travel or the journey to the moon,&quot; Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin said at a presentation in New York.</P><P> Energy groups Exxon and <mark>Rosneft</mark> plan to invest a total of more than 380 billion euros ($502 billion) in their cooperation. At least 15 sea platforms would be built on the Arctic Kara Sea, Sechin told reporters. The Kara Sea is estimated to hold 36 billion barrels of recoverable reserves.</P><P> &quot;Today <mark>Rosneft</mark> and Exxon Mobil enter offshore projects of unprecedented scale,&quot; said Rosnef President Eduard Khudainatov.</P><DIV class=""picBox	full

""><P>Oil rigs used in the Arctic Ocean have to be iceproof - like here in the Caspian Sea</P></DIV><P> Environmental groups have warned about the dangers of a possible oil disaster in the region with its sensitive ecosystems. According to Greenpeace, the Arctic ecosystem is the ultimate loser in the deal between <mark>Rosneft</mark> and Exxon, which was initially made public in August 2011 and has only now been presented with all its details.</P><P> &quot;An oil spill like the one we saw in the Gulf of Mexico would have far worse consequences in the Arctic,&quot; said Greenpeace's oil expert Jörg Feddern.</P><P> Scientists blame the chemicals that were used to dissolve the oil after the accident for reports about diseases and disfiguration of fish and shrimps in the Gulf of Mexico. And more than 20 years after the Exxon Valdez spill the waters in Alaska still carry traces of oil.</P><DIV class=""picBox	medium


""><P>The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico killed many animals</P></DIV><P>A study by the international insurance company Lloyds warned about the high risks entailed in economic endeavors in the Arctic. Charles Emmerson of the Chatham House think tank which conducted the study on behalf of Lloyds, said there are &quot;imminent costs, environmental risks, and uncertainties&quot; to developing the Arctic and that strong political guidance, risk management and enhanced scientific research are necessary to cope with the project's unique risks and challenges.</P><P><STRONG>Education vs. extraction</STRONG></P><P> John Farrel, CEO of the US Arctic Research Commission, said additional data about the Arctic needed to be collected. The region is warming up twice as fast as the rest of the planet and he added that research was losing in significance as the race for resources picked up speed.</P><P> Aqqualuk Lynge, a Greenlander and chairman of the Inuit organization Circumpolar Council, which represents some 160,000 Inuit who live in the Arctic regions of Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Chukotka (Russia) and calls for caution and sustainability when accessing the Arctic's natural resources, criticized the speed with which the project has been pushed forward. He said he doubted the technology was in place to drill safely in Arctic waters without harming seals and whales.</P><P><STRONG>Infrastructure with flaws </STRONG></P><P> Safety and infrastructure represent big challenges when drilling and transporting oil across the Arctic, according to Jörn Harald Andersen, a consultant with Norwegian Clean Seas Association (NOFO), which supports the operating companies in Norwegian waters in charge of cleaning away oil spills.</P><DIV class=""picBox	medium

""><P>Less ice because of <mark>climate change</mark> means the Arctic is more accessible</P></DIV><P>&quot;The further north we go for work the less daylight there obviously is in winter,&quot; Andersen said, adding that the companies also have to deal with restricted visibility because of fog, low temperatures and a lack of proper infrastructure.</P><P> &quot;We have to transport lots of equipment and staff there. There's hardly any local support and logistics is more difficult than elsewhere,&quot; he said. But he also said he is convinced that his group could cope with a potential oil spill in the Arctic.</P><P><STRONG>Ecosystem under pressure</STRONG></P><P> Environmental groups, however, disagree. WWF and Greenpeace both said they doubt the oil industry is sufficiently prepared for a large oil spill in the Arctic.</P><P> Signing a sea rescue operation agreement by the Arctic Council last year is not enough to guarantee safety when expanding oil exploitation and oil transport activities in the Arctic, according to Frida Bengtsson of Greenpeace Norway.</P><P> The Arctic's enormous territory is difficult to access, making it difficult to react appropriately in the event of an oil disaster caused by drilling activities or tanker transport, she said.</P><P> &quot;I think it's the biggest imminent threat to the Arctic ecosystem,&quot; Bengtsson said.</P><P> Author: Irene Quaile / nh       </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

ExxonMobil, the largest American petroleum company, and <mark>Rosneft</mark>, one of Russia’s huge state-owned oil companies, really hit it lucky, striking oil with their first well—drilled by the West Alpha, a semisubmersible owned by Norway-based North Atlantic Drilling and operated by ExxonMobil.</P><P>Well, maybe not just lucky—years ago surveys earmarked this chunk of the Arctic as 100% likely to contain oil and gas resources, as it does below the neighborhood immediately onshore (the West Siberian oil and gas province, which accounts for 60% of Russia’s current oil production). <A href=""http://www.<mark>rosneft</mark>.com/Upstream/Exploration/arctic_seas/"">The Kara Sea oil well</A> apparently has the potential to exceed the oil production of the Gulf of Mexico. China is the most likely buyer because of its location.</P><P>Igor Sechin, the head of <mark>Rosneft</mark>, characterized the discovery:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“Preliminary assessment of the resource base only for this first opening has trapped 338 million cubic meters of gas and 100 million tons of oil, and this is only one of the [geologic] structures in this field.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The East Prinovozemelsky field drilled into by the over-2,000 m (6,500 ft) Universitetskaya-1 exploratory well sets a precedent for drilling 30-40 other wells nearby, the Russians say.</P><P>The first location could be producing oil in five or six years. Nice sweet, light crude oil, comparable to Siberian Light, unlike the nastier Urals blend. Why, the drillers even anticipate a price of $140-150 per barrel when the black gold starts coming up, based on ever-increasing oil price rise scenarios. And the supply may last the world all of another year, if enough of it is recoverable.</P><P>Super for President Putin. His country gets 2/3 of the spoils. ExxonMobil, which inked the deal in 2011 after BP’s bid was nullified, and before Shell’s spectacular failure to drill safely in US arctic waters and the resulting moratorium, has the lesser share. (ExxonMobil also has a pact to co-drill Russia’s Tuapse field in the Black Sea and has agreed to spin off some of its Gulf of Mexico subsea real estate to Russia—but those aren’t the topics at hand.)</P><H4>So whose interests does ExxonMobil represent in the Kara Sea oil well?</H4><P>You might well ask. I’d say, neither American nor Russian, but strictly ExxonMobil’s. The Irving, Texas-based company apparently persuaded the Russians that it had the know-how to drill the northernmost well Russia ever attempted in the Arctic Ocean. It also had welcome cash to pour into the venture, the lion’s share of $3.2 billion. And the US company won’t be able to recoup its expenses until production starts. What’s for Russia to lose?</P><P style=""color: #212121;"">But just in case, ExxonMobil spent $6.3 million <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/27/<mark>rosneft</mark>-arctic-discovery-idUSL6N0RS04Z20140927"">lobbying the US  government</A> so far 2014 and listed Russian sanctions as one of its lobbying issues, Senate disclosures have revealed.</P><P>ExxonMobil has entered <A href=""http://www.<mark>rosneft</mark>.com"">other joint ventures with Russia</A>, too. The partners also agreed to create an “Arctic Research and Design Center for Offshore Developments” in St. Petersburg, Russia. Work on the center is already under way. Russian media describe it as the first institution capable of solving all the tasks the company will face when developing continental shelf deposits.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“It will gather global and Russian expertise, develop key competences needed to develop shelf deposits and create new underwater production technologies, including developing ice-class drilling platforms, ships and rigs and underwater systems for oil preparation and shipment.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The co-venture has already restored the system of <A href=""http://www.<mark>rosneft</mark>.com/news/news_in_press/28082014.html"">meteorological observations</A> in the Kara Sea, which will provide drillers in the region with a full-fledged complex of meteorological monitoring. The group has also started monitoring marine mammal and bird habitat in the region, with special attention to polar bears.</P><H4>Uh-oh, Russia does a “my bad”</H4><P>Unfortunately, Putin chucked a spanner in the works by deciding to secure the Ukraine’s major port, hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s, and pipelines to Europe at about the same time. ExxonMobil has now had to bow out of the Kara Sea oil well deal because of the sanctions leveled against Russia for rummaging around in Europe’s heartland.</P><P>The American company has a few weeks longer than the agreed deadline, ostensibly to secure the well and platform for the safety of its Russian operators. Russian sources have said they will honor the agreement if the sanctions go away and the nominally US company can return soon, but they have also made it quite clear that they’re open to the idea of new partners.</P><P>And what else do you know? The Russians apparently believe they’ve learned about all Exxon has to teach them, because <mark>Rosneft</mark> Vice President <A href=""http://en.ria.ru/business/20140920/193121915/Vice-President-<mark>Rosneft</mark>-Capable-of-Arctic-Drilling-Without.html"">Larisa Kalanda</A> said at the International Investment Forum Sochi 2014 that they now have the know-how to go ahead on their own.</P><P>Just to sum things up, here’s how <A href=""http://eandt.theiet.org/news/2014/aug/russia-north-arctic.cfm"">President Putin</A> described the situation in a videoconference before the third round of sanctions was instituted:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“Today, commercial success is driven by efficient international cooperation. Businesses, including Russian and foreign companies, perfectly realize that… despite certain current political difficulties, pragmatism and common sense prevail, and we are pleased to hear that.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG><EM>To be continued…</EM></STRONG></P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Global warming is no different. As devastating an effect as <mark>climate change</mark> will have on our planet and on billions of lives (and on the earth’s ability to produce what we need), there will be some industries that will benefit – adding value to the economy, if not of equal worth, at least of substantial weight. (For more, see: <A href=""/financial-edge/0210/7-ways-<mark>climate</mark>-change-affects-companies.aspx"">Seven Ways <mark>Climate Change</mark> Affects Companies</A>.)</P><H2>Companies Engaged in Profiteering</H2><P>First, perhaps, we should mention the companies that will simply be profiteering – money making at its most Darwinian. Believe it or not, there are companies that have been inventing what has been described as “Wall Street-type tools” in order to make profitable bets on what <A href=""/terms/c/commodity.asp"">commodities</A> could soon be scarce. KKR, a <A href=""/terms/p/privateequity.asp"">private equity </A>firm, announced in <A href=""http://media.kkr.com/media/media_releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=735445"">January 2013 </A>that it bought 25% of the shares of a Bermuda <A href=""/terms/h/hedgefund.asp"">hedge fund </A>known as Nephila Capital that trades weather <A href=""/terms/d/derivative.asp"">derivatives</A>. (For more, see: <A href=""/trading/market-futures-introduction-to-weather-derivatives/"">An Overview Of Weather Derivatives</A>.)</P><P>There are also companies that are advising their wealthy clients on making purchases of land, specifically farmland, which will be more valuable as <mark>climate change</mark> impacts weather patterns. In fact, investors, via financial service firms, are purchasing water rights, as well as farmland, because of the large profits that will be made due to drought and food shortages. Oil exploration and drilling might also be facilitated in areas where ice is melting in the Arctic, exposing untapped reserves. Several <A href=""http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5664"">major projects </A>are already being carried out, and there is a rush by various countries to lay claim to certain areas. The major players that have been mentioned include Royal Dutch Shell (<A href=""/markets/stocks/rds-a/"">RDS-A</A>) and <A href=""http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/environment/environmental-performance/managing-arctic-resources/managing-arctic-resources"">Exxon Mobil Corp.</A> (<A href=""/markets/stocks/xom/"">XOM</A>), as well as Russian oil companies like <A href=""http://www.<mark>rosneft</mark>.com/Upstream/Exploration/arctic_seas/""><mark>Rosneft</mark></A> and <A href=""http://www.gazprom-neft.com/press-center/news/1102432/"">Gazprom Neft</A>. Another beneficiary of <mark>climate change</mark> will be the insurance companies, since every natural disaster that occurs encourages more individuals to purchase a protection plan. Also, they will be able to raise rates as a result of the increased frequency of such disasters. (For more, see: <A href=""/articles/pf/05/insurescore.asp"">How An Insurance Company Determines Your Premiums</A>.)</P><H2>Strategizing to Benefit Themselves</H2><P>Then there are those companies in a grey area—capitalizing perhaps on the trend, but also introducing or implementing strategies that could be seen as a way to cope. These include companies like those in the agricultural biotech sector – companies like Monsanto Company (<A href=""/markets/stocks/mon/"">MON</A>) that make genetically modified seeds, which they say will be able to withstand a harsher <mark>climate</mark> with prolonged droughts or frosts.</P><P>Arctic shipping companies, due to melting ice, have also been seeing a positive impact on their bottom line, made possible due to reduced costs of certain shipping routes, courtesy of global warming. Melting ice at the North Pole has reportedly made it possible for ships to take summertime journeys along the <A href=""http://www.nordicbulkcarriers.com/services/nsr-project"">Northern Sea Route </A>along the Arctic Circle. By heading north, instead of traveling over 11,000 miles across the Indian Ocean and Egypt’s Suez Canal, corporations that ship goods over the ocean between East Asia and Western Europe (like <A href=""http://www.nordicbulkcarriers.com/services/access-project"">Nordic Bulk Carriers</A>) have reportedly, with the support of icebreakers, been able to <A href=""http://intl<mark>pollution</mark>.commons.gc.cuny.edu/the-use-of-the-northern-sea-route-and-its-effect-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">save up to $500,000 </A>per trip.</P><P>Also, not surprisingly, there will be increased sales of standard air-conditioning. It is projected, according to leading forecast models, that the earth's temperatures will rise between three and eight degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. In fact, John Staples, president and CEO of US Air Conditioning, has been quoted as saying that “the hotter it gets, the more your business increases.” That assessment has been echoed in <A href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421508005168"">research documents </A>that project that energy demand for air conditioning (which is positively correlated with the purchase of air conditioning units) will increase at a rapid rate over the entire 2000-2100 period.</P><H2>Industries Generating Solutions</H2><P>Most significantly, though, there will be industries emerging due to global warming that represent what industry is really all about—creating something of value in response to a need. These are enterprises oriented toward solutions and <mark>innovation</mark>, and that introduce something to the marketplace that indeed enhances the lives of those who purchase that something.</P><P>These include construction companies that are coming up with innovative ways to stem coastal flooding. The innovators that stand out in this industry include Flood Control America, a firm in Massachusetts which specializes in “invisible flood wall installation” – a steel wall that, whenever there is a warning of a flood, can be quickly set up, and can be dismantled and stored when there is no need for it. The firm’s vice president of communications, was quoted as saying, “It is difficult to see how removable flood-wall systems will not continue to increase in number across the country and the globe. …There is simply too much money invested in commercial, municipal and residential – to abandon properties to rising sea levels.”</P><P>The industries engaged in production that could also benefit include:</P><OL><LI>The <A href=""/terms/r/renewable_resource.asp"">renewable</A> energy industry: It's been recommended that renewable energy constitute 80% of the power sector by 2050. Developing nations are adopting renewables, and in 2013, for the first time in China, new renewable capacity surpassed both new fossil fuels and the country’s nuclear capacity. (For more, see: <A href=""/articles/personal-finance/053115/how-become-renewable-energy-entrepreneur.asp"">How To Become A Renewable Energy Entrepreneur</A>.)</LI><LI>Automakers producing hybrid cars. Higher gas prices might also increase demand for such vehicles. (For more, see: <A href=""/financial-edge/0412/are-hybrid-vehicles-worth-the-extra-cost.aspx"">Are Hybrid Vehicles Worth The Extra Cost?)</A></LI><LI>Companies devising innovative solutions such as Rayonier, a timber company that is trying to find a way to produce timber that would not result in the emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into the atmosphere, and Daikin Industries Ltd., which is the maker of energy-efficient air conditioners. Also, there are companies like BASF SE, which makes fungicide and seed coatings to enable plants to be more resilient.</LI><LI>Industries that are sources of reclaimed material and re-purposed furniture: Preferences for home décor and construction materials might increasingly lean toward reclaimed and re-purposed items, thus causing increased demand in these sectors.</LI><LI>Finally, manufacturers of the basic products consumers will need to purchase to cope with increased exposure to the sun, such as new types of clothing, eyewear, umbrellas, and of course, sunscreen. A report produced by IBIS World, a market research company, stated that sales of sunscreen products grew yearly by 4.2% between 2007 and 2014, and total annual sales were $382 million. The <A href=""http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/report/skin-cancer-on-the-rise/"">Environmental Working Group </A>also noted in an article on its website that there are an increasing number of skin cancer cases, and it has further stated, “Americans are aware that excessive exposure in sunlight can cause cancer.”</LI></OL><H2>The Bottom Line</H2><P>Global warming is a reality that will have a devastating impact on the livelihoods, health, and quality of life of billions. And yet, there are industries that will report increased earnings because of <mark>climate change</mark>. Some of these will simply be profiteering – cashing in on profits that will be there for the taking, while there are industries that will be actively generating solutions to problems and challenges generated by <mark>climate change</mark>, and will be bringing innovative offerings to the market.

But it appears <A href=""https://inhabitat.com/tag/oil/"" target=""_blank"">oil</A> giant <A href=""http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/"" target=""_blank"">ExxonMobil</A> would like an exception for their own profit.

ExxonMobil officials also said they’d exhorted members of the Obama administration to align U.S. sanctions with European sanctions which allowed some flexibility for European companies to continue working on Russian projects.</P><P>The Wall Street Journal first reported on ExxonMobil’s sanctions waiver request yesterday, and The New York Times confirmed the story with an oil industry official. An ExxonMobil spokesperson refused to comment to The New York Times on the waiver application. The application will go before the Trump administration at a tenuous time, as an inquiry into Russia’s potential influence on the American presidential election continues.</P><P>At a 2014 Exxon annual meeting, Tillerson as CEO said, “We do not support sanctions, generally, because we don’t find them to be effective unless they are very well implemented comprehensively, and that’s a very hard thing to do.” But as Secretary of State he has not suggested sanctions be lifted.</P><P><mark>Rosneft</mark> and Exxon made a deal back in 2011 to invest $3.2 billion to explore the Black Sea and the Arctic Ocean, with the pledge to share in the findings if oil were discovered. </P><P>Obama’s U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael A.

But photos of those meetings re-emerged over the weekend, as multiple media reports named the Texas oilman as the favorite to become Donald Trump's secretary of state. </P><P>(The president-elect <A href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/808469755749339136"">tweeted Monday night</A> that he would announce his pick for the position on Tuesday morning. A source with knowledge of Trump's choice tells NPR he will nominate Tillerson.

Trump continues to amaze,&quot; Russian senator Alexei Pushkov tweeted on Saturday night. &quot;This choice confirms the seriousness of Trump's intentions.&quot; </P><P>The Kremlin was a little more circumspect. There's a big difference between being secretary of state and heading up a major company, Putin's spokesman <A href=""https://ria.ru/world/20161212/1483372192.html"">Dmitry Peskov told journalists on Monday</A>. More important than sympathy toward Russia, he said, is &quot;a constructive attitude and professionalism.&quot; </P><P>Tillerson proved those two qualities to Putin when he oversaw <A href=""http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/company/worldwide-operations/locations/russia/about/overview"">ExxonMobil's 2011 strategic alliance</A> with <A href=""https://www.<mark>rosneft</mark>.com/"">Russia's state-run <mark>Rosneft</mark></A>. While some of the world's biggest oil majors — BP, Shell, Total — saw their Russian projects frustrated, ExxonMobil came out on top as the Kremlin's unlikely partner of choice. </P><P>The only thing stopping that relationship from developing were U.S. sanctions against Russia following its annexation of Crimea in 2014. <mark>Rosneft</mark> president Igor Sechin, a close Putin associate, was <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/29/world/asia/obama-sanctions-russia.html?_r=0"">barred from traveling to the U.S.</A></P><P>&quot;The Russians respect strength, and they see it in ExxonMobil and Rex Tillerson. They like him,&quot; Edward Verona, a former ExxonMobil Russia vice president, told NPR. &quot;Putin likes that personality type — not exactly the Trump personality, but the personality that quietly projects power, discipline, control.&quot; </P><P>Tillerson's rise to the top of ExxonMobil came after he brought <A href=""http://www.sakhalin-1.com/Sakhalin/Russia-English/Upstream/default.aspx"">Sakhalin-1</A>, an offshore development in Russia's remote Far East, online. <A href=""http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/articles/2005/10/11/intervyu-rex-tillerson-prezident-exxonmobil"">In a 2005 interview with a Russian newspaper</A>, Tillerson attributed the project's success to ExxonMobil's straightforward dealings with the Russian authorities. </P><P>Ten years ago, when Shell lost control of the nearby Sakhalin-2 project to Russia's Gazprom, Tillerson warded off pressure from the state-run gas company by building bridges to its rival, <mark>Rosneft</mark>. </P><P>&quot;Rex found an ally in <mark>Rosneft</mark> in taking on the 800-pound gorilla, Gazprom,&quot; said Verona. &quot;It's a pretty good example of diplomacy, alliance-building, seeing who your friends are and what they can do for you. It was pretty shrewd deal-making.&quot; </P><P>At the same time, even Gazprom executives were impressed by the way Tillerson fought back attempts by President Hugo Chavez <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/business/global/venezuela-ordered-to-pay-900-million-to-exxon-mobil.html"">to seize ExxonMobil assets in Venezuela</A>, Verona said. </P><P>ExxonMobil was not the most obvious choice to work with the Kremlin, not least because it is an American company. But after Sakhalin-1 brought Russia new technology and revenue under a so-called production-sharing agreement that went into effect in 1996, the thinking in the Kremlin gradually changed. </P><P>Key to the relationship with <mark>Rosneft</mark> was getting its president, Sechin, on board. </P><P>Sechin, a former KGB agent like Putin, oversaw <mark>Rosneft</mark>'s transformation from a middling oil company into Russia's biggest crude producer, mainly by swallowing up its rivals. </P><P>&quot;Sechin greatly admires and respects ExxonMobil. It's what he wants <mark>Rosneft</mark> to be,&quot; said Verona. &quot;When he meets the quintessential Texan oil guy, he's captivated by him.&quot; </P><P>Tillerson sealed the deal not only by offering to help develop Russia's challenging Arctic oil fields, but also by treating <mark>Rosneft</mark> as an equal with an interest in ExxonMobil projects in the U.S. and third countries. </P><P>That cooperation is now on hold because of sanctions, which <A href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trump-crimea-sanctions-russia-226292"">Trump said during the election campaign he would consider lifting</A>. ExxonMobil and <mark>Rosneft</mark> would be among the biggest beneficiaries, should that happen. </P><P>If Trump nominates the Texan for secretary of state, Tillerson will still need to be confirmed by the Senate. Tillerson's biggest challenge may yet be convincing the Senate that he can distinguish ExxonMobil's interests from those of the United States.</P><DIV class=""fullattribution"">Copyright 2018 NPR.

However chief executive Ivan Glasenberg - famed for his deal-making tastes - refused to rule out &quot;opportunistic&quot; acquisitions.</P><P>Under the deal, Glencore will commit €300m in equity, with the rest being provided by the QIA and bank financing. Its stake in <mark>Rosneft</mark> will be just 0.54pc, however in return Glencore has struck a five-year offtake agreement that will see the Russian company supply it with 220,000 barrels of oil a day - a coup for the miner's trading arm, which ships oil and other commodities around the globe.</P><P>Glencore is already one of the largest traders of Russian oil behind Vitol. It needs to keep high volumes of oil moving through its trading business because margins are small, particularly since the slump in crude prices. Despite being one of the world's biggest miners, it produces relatively little oil, though it does own 25pc of Russneft, Russia's seventh largest producer. </P><P>Glencore and QIA are the first international investors to take a stake in Russia’s largest crude company since the country’s economy was pummelled by international sanctions over the annexation of Crimea.</P><P>They will become investors alongside BP, which received an 18pc stake in <mark>Rosneft</mark> as part of <A href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/9625422/BP-signs-landmark-27bn-deal-with-<mark>Rosneft</mark>.html"">a complex deal in 2013</A> that extricated the London oil firm from its troubled joint venture with the business, known as TNK-BP.</P><P>QIA is a seasoned dealmaker in Russia, pouncing on a number of assets since the country’s plunging currency made acquisitions more affordable. The sovereign fund bought a stake in St Petersburg’s airport over the summer, and added to its portfolio with a near-25pc stake in the state-backed bank VTB in September.</P><P>The move comes as oil prices soared to more than $50 a barrel, following the decision by the Opec countries to cut output for the first time in eight years.</P><P>Russia is not a member of Opec but has signalled that it will<A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-reaches-deal-to-cut-oil-production-1480518187""> join the bloc in reducing output. </A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV class=""facebookLike section""><ASIDE class=""social-follow""><HEADER class=""social-follow__header""><H3 class=""block-heading""><SPAN class=""block-heading__label"">Follow Telegraph Business</SPAN></H3></HEADER></ASIDE></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Schneiderman, into whether Exxon lied to investors and consumers about the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> and how those risks might hurt its business. The investigation has its roots in a report the company released in 2014 in response to shareholder pressure to disclose how vulnerable its assets could be to future <mark>climate</mark> regulations.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-1bytduc emamhsk0""><DIV class=""css-w71pwo emamhsk2""><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">The issue resurfaced this week when a majority of shareholders <A class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/business/energy-environment/exxon-shareholders-<mark>climate</mark>-change.html"" title="""" target=""_blank"">approved a measure</A> asking for a more open and detailed accounting.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">The central question is how Exxon values the fossil fuels it owns but has yet to extract. <mark>Climate</mark> scientists have suggested that if the world were to burn even just a portion of the oil in the ground that the industry declares on its books, the planet would heat up to catastrophic levels — an argument that has been boiled down to the slogan “keep it in the ground.”</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">By that logic, if policies aimed at slowing global warming mean that Exxon has to leave those reserves in the ground, their declared value could be far too high.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">According to the filings, starting in 2010, Exxon told its investors that it used one set of estimates known as proxy costs while a set of lower costs was used internally in business planning.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Exxon Mobil rejected the assertions.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“For many years, Exxon Mobil has applied a proxy cost of <mark>carbon</mark> to its investment opportunities, where appropriate, in order to anticipate the aggregate financial impact of future government policies,” it said in a statement. “Exxon Mobil’s external statements have accurately described its use of a proxy cost of <mark>carbon</mark>, and the documents produced to the attorney general make this fact unmistakably clear.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-1bytduc emamhsk0""><DIV class=""css-w71pwo emamhsk2""><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">The state’s filings on Friday asserted that Exxon’s public estimates for projects in developed countries set the proxy costs at $60 a ton of greenhouse gases by 2030 and $80 a ton by 2040, while internally the company assumed the price reached only $40 a ton by 2030.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">The filings show that an Exxon <mark>climate change</mark> manager wrote in a 2010 email that the higher figures were “more realistic,” but that Rex W. Tillerson, then chief executive, approved of the accounting discrepancy and wrote in an email in 2011 that he was “happy with the difference.” Mr. Tillerson left the company late last year to become secretary of state in the Trump administration.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Mr. Schneiderman’s office asserts that there is little evidence that the company applied even the lower figures, with only one instance of a price being used in the documents the company turned over.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“It appears that Exxon’s proxy-cost risk-management process may be a sham,” John Oleske, senior enforcement counsel to the attorney general’s office, wrote in one of the filings.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">In response to subpoenas, the company has provided at least 400,000 documents totaling millions of pages.

Happy days are here again, for Exxon,” Joe Romm writes.</P><P>Well, for more, we are joined by Joe Romm in Washington, D.C., who also is chief science adviser for <EM>Years of Living Dangerously</EM>. So, Joe Romm, for people who have no idea what this is about, this <mark>Rosneft</mark> deal and the sanctions and what it would mean if they’re lifted, please lay it out for us.</P><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">JOE</SPAN><SPAN class=""caps"">ROMM</SPAN>:</STRONG> Sure. Well, <mark>Rosneft</mark> is the state oil company for Russia, and, under Putin, it has been acquiring more and more power and control over the oil industry. And it is now, you know, I believe, the world’s largest oil entity in the world. ExxonMobil is the world’s largest, you know, privately held oil company in the world. And, you know, we’re entering a period where it’s harder and harder to find oil. And as I write in <EM><mark>Climate</mark> Progress</EM>, you know, ExxonMobil’s prospects for finding easy-to-find oil in this market were pretty dim, until this deal was struck between Tillerson and Putin, basically. And this deal would have created a $500 billion joint effort, you know, the biggest oil deal ever. It’s, you know, $500 billion. We’re talking half a trillion dollars. It’s a staggering amount of money. It was a deal that was perhaps going to ensure the future of a stream of oil for Exxon for decades to come, even, of course, as the world needs to get off of oil. For Putin, you know, this is critical revenue and critical outside investment, because, particularly now, in this era of low oil prices, that seriously hurts Putin. So this was considered to be a game changer. Rachel Maddow said, you know, this was a deal that was considered it might change the historical trajectory of Russia. Now, you know, Putin then invaded Crimea and interfered with Ukraine. As a result, the United States and most other civilized countries put in place sanctions. Those sanctions, in 2014, killed this deal.</P><P>And, you know, as I write in the piece, the question of—the intelligence community now says that Russia interfered in the election on behalf of Putin, that through leaks, through hacking private email accounts and releasing them—drip, drip, drip—and also we have reason to believe they’re one of the major promoters, disseminators of fake news. So, you know, one can understand the motivation. You know, some people said, “Hey, Putin has enough motivation just to, you know, cast doubt on the U.S. election.” But $500 billion, that is a very big motivation to mess up the U.S. election. So, this—</P><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">AMY</SPAN><SPAN class=""caps"">GOODMAN</SPAN>:</STRONG> So—</P><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">JOE</SPAN><SPAN class=""caps"">ROMM</SPAN>:</STRONG> Yeah?</P><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">AMY</SPAN><SPAN class=""caps"">GOODMAN</SPAN>:</STRONG> So explain what could happen if Tillerson did become secretary of state.</P><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">JOE</SPAN><SPAN class=""caps"">ROMM</SPAN>:</STRONG> Well, if Tillerson becomes secretary of state—and I also want to say the man has no qualifications to be secretary of state. It just deserves to be said. He’s worked for ExxonMobil his entire life. And I know we’ve entered this realm where we just elected Donald Trump president, who is unqualified, and he’s been naming a series of people who are unqualified for their job, but it just needs to be said. So, Tillerson has no qualifications for his job. And he—the deal that he was negotiating with Putin two years ago won him the highest order that Russia gives to a foreign citizen. So, he and Putin are very, very close. And as secretary of state, of course, he is our lead negotiator. He is the president’s top representative to every foreign government in the world. So here’s the signal it sends to the rest of the world: All that matters to the United States is oil and a friendly relationship with Putin. Now, you know, this is a totally, totally compromised secretary of state. It is absurd. In any sane, rational world, you know, this would just be round-the-clock pillory.</P><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">AMY</SPAN><SPAN class=""caps"">GOODMAN</SPAN>:</STRONG> How could Tillerson decide about, for example, lifting the sanctions? What role would the secretary of state play, if he gets that job?</P><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">JOE</SPAN><SPAN class=""caps"">ROMM</SPAN>:</STRONG> Well, so, let’s look at the sanctions from two different—there’s the U.S. sanctions, which the Obama can pretty much—I mean, which a President Trump can pretty much lift most of, himself. But then there’s all the other countries who have sanctions. And in order to make an economic deal between Exxon and <mark>Rosneft</mark>, Russia, work, you’re going to need not just allowing U.S. investment in the country, you’re going to have to allow Russia, you know, to make deals and sell oil with every other country. So, as secretary of state, he can simply make it his top priority to use the full leverage of the United States, in every deal, to benefit the oil industry, to benefit the U.S. oil industry, to benefit <mark>Rosneft</mark>, to benefit Putin. You know, it basically would be turning the U.S. State Department and the U.S. executive branch into what Russia is—a kleptocracy run by Putin and his gang to extract money and enrich themselves.</P><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">AMY</SPAN><SPAN class=""caps"">GOODMAN</SPAN>:</STRONG> And, Joe Romm, what about his own wealth? What about Rex Tillerson’s own wealth? He is the current <SPAN class=""caps"">CEO</SPAN> of Exxon. If he retires and becomes secretary of state, still his money is tied up in Exxon, in what happens to Exxon, what the secretary—what the State Department and other government agencies, how they relate to Exxon.</P><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">JOE</SPAN><SPAN class=""caps"">ROMM</SPAN>:</STRONG> Yes. And he would presumably divest. He would presumably have to sell off, you know, his 100-plus million dollars’ worth of shares of ExxonMobil, and because of the way the law is written, he can do that tax-free. But I think it’s important to say that, you know, someone who has worked his life, all his life, at ExxonMobil, all the way up to the top of the company, is hardly going to be able to separate his interests and the interests of all of his close personal friends and family simply by divesting himself of the stock. He is ExxonMobil. And you should just see that on his forehead whenever you look at him.</P><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">AMY</SPAN><SPAN class=""caps"">GOODMAN</SPAN>:</STRONG> Carroll Muffett, we just have a minute, but you’re seeing one agency head after another, one Cabinet member named after another, related to Exxon, in fact.</P><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">CARROLL</SPAN><SPAN class=""caps"">MUFFETT</SPAN>:</STRONG> Yes. If you look at Jeff Sessions, he intervened in the investigations—</P><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">AMY</SPAN><SPAN class=""caps"">GOODMAN</SPAN>:</STRONG> The attorney general nominee.</P><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">CARROLL</SPAN><SPAN class=""caps"">MUFFETT</SPAN>:</STRONG> —of Exxon. If you look at Scott Pruitt, the nominee for <SPAN class=""caps"">EPA</SPAN>, he intervened in the investigation of Exxon by other state attorneys general. Then you add—you add Rex Tillerson. And on <mark>climate change</mark>, what we’re looking at is government of Exxon, by Exxon and for Exxon. But it’s really important to recognize that this is emblematic of a broader trend that we’re seeing in Trump’s nominations, where, in one agency after another, he has put people in charge of agencies that are patently hostile to both the agency itself and to the people and places those agencies are designed to protect. It’s looking to move us a hundred years backward in time and undo a hundred years of environmental and social progress.</P><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">AMY</SPAN><SPAN class=""caps"">GOODMAN</SPAN>:</STRONG> And finally, Bill McKibben, one of his transition team representatives said today on one of the talk shows that this is a man who is very accomplished in business, so he’ll be reviewing the budget of the State Department and, you know, who should be there and who shouldn’t. We hear about the Department of Energy. Donald Trump just said he will be deciding very soon, after becoming president, what to do about the Dakota Access pipeline, which the Obama administration has said no to granting the final permit to, and the Keystone XL, which your group, 350.org, and so many others fought so hard, until Obama, the—President Obama said no to the Keystone XL. Finally, what does this mean, and how is 350.org organizing?</P><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">BILL</SPAN> McKIBBEN:</STRONG> 2016 is the hottest year in human history. And we’re going to have to make 2017 as politically hot as it is humanly possible to do. If people have been keeping their powder dry, waiting to come out and engage in peaceful protest, well, this is the moment. Everything is at risk, both in terms of our democracy and our planet. And so, we will organize at 350, just as people will organize all over the country. And we’ll do it not with complete confidence that we’re going to win; we’ll do it because we have to do it. And we will see what happens. This is one of those hinge moments in human history, and, actually, in planetary history, too. I’m not sure there’s never been one quite like it, Amy.</P><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">AMY</SPAN><SPAN class=""caps"">GOODMAN</SPAN>:</STRONG> Well, I want to go—end with a clip from Fox News this Sunday, Donald Trump interviewed by Chris Wallace on the pipeline.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG><SPAN class=""caps"">CHRIS</SPAN><SPAN class=""caps"">WALLACE</SPAN>:</STRONG> Let me ask you a couple of specific questions.

Despite several difficulties, Russian President Vladimir Putin has demonstrated to the rest of the world that his following has continued to grow in his country. A former KGB official, he became President Boris Yeltsin’s prime minister and then succeeded him as president in March 2000.<SPAN class=""Apple-converted-space""> </SPAN>
Re-elected as president in 2004, he returned for another term in 2012. However, this time it was for six years. The latest Russian poll on March 18 has led to his re-election as president (for the fourth time) for another six years till 2024. Putin had received nearly 76.5% of the votes. Through his fourth term, he will now be his country’s longest-serving leader since Soviet era’s Joseph Stalin.
There is little doubt that Russia in its own way is changing the world. In the last four years, Russia has annexed Crimea from Ukraine, allegedly meddled in the US presidential electoral process, and helped turn the tide of the Syrian war in President Bashar al-Assad’s favour.
<B>The West vs Russia</B>
The Russian president is currently facing a diplomatic crisis with the UK. Both countries have expelled 23 diplomats each, over a nerve agent attack against a former spy allegedly carried out by Russian agents in Salisbury, England. The implications of the allegation by British authorities and UK’s top defense official that Russia was “ripping up the international rulebook” have continued to grow.<SPAN class=""Apple-converted-space""> </SPAN>
By March 28, the anti-Russian response had led to 25 other countries (including the US, Canada, and Australia) and the NATO taking similar decisions to expel Russian diplomatic staff. Some have even indicated that countries should boycott the upcoming FIFA World Cup being held later this year in Russia.<SPAN class=""Apple-converted-space""> </SPAN>
This stern approach on part of the Western countries has led to Russia taking the reciprocal tit-for-tat step of expelling 60 US diplomats from Russia, closing the US consulate in Saint Petersburg, and expelling 57 diplomats from 23 countries. This reaction appears to have increased Putin’s stature and his political support at home.
<SPAN class=""Apple-converted-space""> </SPAN>President Vladimir Putin’s actions in the recent past are clearly indicating that he not only has a growing appetite for power beyond Russia’s borders, but also feels that Russia can fill the void in parts of the world where the US once wielded unipolar influence. Strategic analysts have selected the following areas where Russia is expected to enhance its presence throughout the globe.
<B>1. Rule over cyberspace</B>
It may be noted that in addition to the US, several other European nations (UK, France, and Germany) have been accusing Russia of cyber-meddling for some time -- particularly in the influencing of voting in these countries.<SPAN class=""Apple-converted-space""> </SPAN><B>2. Flexing military muscle</B>
Putin has not backed off during the last four years from underlining his country’s growing military power. In the recent past, Russian warplanes have bombed territory, and mercenaries and advisers on the ground have supported offensives to prop up Syrian President Assad.<SPAN class=""Apple-converted-space""> </SPAN>
Russia’s firepower has helped turn the war around in Assad’s favour, and has made the country a game-changing player in the complex multi-sided conflict. That role also means a stronger foothold in the Middle East (including Libya) for Russia. Russian forces have also held joint military drills with Egypt on Russian soil.<SPAN class=""Apple-converted-space""> </SPAN>
Russia’s military power has also enabled Moscow to annex the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. It was a move that led to sanctions and condemnation from the West. However, this stand-off appears to have clearly boosted Russia’s image as a major world power within the adjoining regions.<SPAN class=""Apple-converted-space""> </SPAN><B>3. Bring me more guns</B>
There is also the race between Russia and the US to sell conventional arms. Russia is the second-biggest exporter of arms behind the US, and it is now finding markets, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) in countries that traditionally bought American-made weapons, especially in Asia and the Middle East.<SPAN class=""Apple-converted-space""> </SPAN><BLOCKQUOTE>Russia is expected now to try to forge new alliances</BLOCKQUOTE>
India, the world’s largest importer of major arms between 2013 and 2017, has purchased 62% of its arms from Russia during this period. Military officials in the US, Europe, and Afghanistan are concerned that Russia might also be providing supplies to the Taliban in Afghanistan. Russia is also selling arms to countries in Southeast Asia -- Indonesia and Myanmar. Russia has signed agreements for arms exports to the Philippines.
<B>4. A true global power<SPAN class=""Apple-converted-space""> </SPAN></B>
All these elements are directed towards countering US influence in geo-politics. Russia is expected now to try to forge new alliances. It may be recalled that last year Russia’s Finance Ministry came to the aid of crisis-hit Venezuela with a deal to restructure its sovereign debt. This burgeoning relationship with Venezuela has given Russia an important economic and political foothold in Latin America -- at a time when US-Venezuelan relations have declined further.
The result of this exercise was evident in December last year, with Venezuela awarding licenses to a unit of <mark>Rosneft</mark>, Russia’s state-controlled oil company, to develop offshore gas fields.<SPAN class=""Apple-converted-space""> </SPAN>
Closer to home, Russia is hoping to use its historical and cultural ties in the Balkans. Kremlin is keen to use these links to counter NATO expansion in the region. Russia is also trying to boost ties with eastern European nations that are not NATO members, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Macedonia.
<B>5. Harvesting influence in oil industry</B>
Russia might now also try to use its oil production to boost ties with countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.<SPAN class=""Apple-converted-space""> </SPAN>
This would be comparatively easy as many former Soviet nations in Eastern Europe rely heavily on Russian oil and gas to fuel their economies. That includes Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Lithuania. They are supposedly trying to diversify their energy sources to reduce their dependence on Russia but that does not appear to be possible in the near future.<SPAN class=""Apple-converted-space""> </SPAN>
Russia in the meantime is also trying to enhance its presence in Iraq. In that country, Russian state oil company <mark>Rosneft</mark> has signed contracts to gain control of the main oil pipeline in the Kurdistan region, thereby boosting Russia’s influence there and creating anxiety within the US. It has also teamed up with Saudi Arabia -- another country with an oil-dependent economy -- and agreed to extend oil production cuts to buoy global prices.
<B>6. Befriending the Middle East</B>
Increasing diplomatic contacts in the Middle East. This has been evident not only in the context of Saudi Arabia, but is also true with regards to Iran, a longtime adversary of the US. This country is now allied with Russia on the ground in Syria, and also appears to be sharing approaches with regard to Afghanistan and the Taliban.<SPAN class=""Apple-converted-space""> </SPAN>
At the same time, Putin has also hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Elsewhere in the region, Russia is also expected to expand its contacts with Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Russia has also become closer to Turkey because of the Syria crisis.
Strategic analysts believe that for all these reasons, the next six years might see the world gradually change with China and Russia sharing a bi-polar geo-strategic paradigm with the US.

But is Russia’s bad reputation regarding management and mitigation of environmental risk entirely deserved? What lies behind this reputation, and how is Russia actually approaching ecology in the Arctic? Maria Lagutina and Nadezhda Kharlampieva, two associate professors of world politics at Saint Petersburg State University who focus on cross-regional development in the Arctic, shared their thoughts on these questions.</SPAN></P><H2>Not the Only Black Sheep in the Herd</H2><P>If you are wondering whether the <SPAN class=""caps"">AZRF</SPAN> really is the part of the Arctic where environmental problems are the most acute, the answer is both yes and no. Because the Russian segment is the largest, most industrialized and most populated, it is not surprising that such concerns are more salient there than in other Arctic regions. But Russia is by no means an isolated case or a black sheep among Arctic countries.</P><P><SPAN class=""s1"">According to Lagutina, the problems manifested in the <SPAN class=""caps"">AZRF</SPAN> can be traced back to the industrial development of the region during Soviet times. In other Arctic countries, there is no comparable period of industrial activity, and the population is significantly smaller. “Consequently, the anthropogenic footprint and <mark>pollution</mark> levels in their Arctic ecosystems are lower,” she said, although no Arctic country is innocent when it comes to <mark>pollution</mark>. For Kharlampieva, it is unfair to compare the environmental situation in Russia with other Arctic countries, because it differs in scale and nature. “The size of the territories and their climatic characteristics are different, the level of exploration is different, the requirements for regional development are different,” she said. Kharlampieva also pointed out that Arctic environmental issues are regional, if not global, in nature, so their causes and effects should be studied as such.</SPAN></P><H2><SPAN class=""s1"">Cleaning up the <SPAN class=""caps"">AZRF</SPAN></SPAN></H2><P><SPAN class=""s1"">The Russian approach to environmental risk is highly pragmatic. This strategy has its advantages and its downsides – on the one hand, when and where they do pay attention, Russian lawmakers tend to produce comprehensive legislation that address not only the symptoms, but also the causes of environmental degradation in the <SPAN class=""caps"">AZRF.</SPAN> But on the other hand, because the Arctic is perceived as the nexus of Russia’s future prosperity because of the resources it contains, transnational environmentalist efforts have little traction, and are sometimes suspected of being directed against Russia’s economic and political interests. Their pragmatism means that Russian decision-makers are seldom ready to make concessions at the expense of the economy, unless the cost of not doing so is both clear and immediate. It also means that they prefer to commit only to immediate solutions – such as clean-up operations – and neglect to take action to address complex, long-term issues, such as the link between a fossil fuel-based economy and <mark>climate</mark> change.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""s1"">Russia is an active player in regional environmental cooperation, not least within the framework of the Arctic Council, where Russian representatives are well aware of Russia’s interest in mitigating transborder ecological risks. However, at the domestic level, quite unsurprisingly, the main focus is on <mark>pollution</mark> of the <SPAN class=""caps"">AZRF</SPAN> rather than broader issues related to <mark>climate change</mark>, which are perceived as more abstract and transnational.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""s1"">“[Lately] Russia has taken serious measures to improve the situation, with several high-profile projects to clean the <SPAN class=""caps"">AZRF</SPAN>,” Lagutina said. In the last few years, for example, the country succeeded in reducing the number of “hot spots” – areas where <mark>pollution</mark> levels are strikingly higher than safety standards – in the northwest of Russia, including the Komi Republic. Since 2010, the Russian Geographical Society has supported a project that aims to clean up the fuels and lubricants, machinery, equipment and garbage left on the coasts of the Arctic Ocean in the 1990s. Lagutina also noted that “in Russia, environmental issues are not a priority, but for the <SPAN class=""caps"">AZRF</SPAN> the situation is a little different.” Because the <SPAN class=""caps"">AZRF</SPAN> is considered a critical zone in geo-economic terms, Moscow pays more attention to it. “Environmental questions of the Arctic are under the president’s personal control, which fosters greater efforts by the actors involved. Gazprom and <mark>Rosneft</mark> [a majority state-owned Russian natural gas company and a Russian state-owned oil company] support a number of ecological projects – even the military is involved in cleanup operations,” she said.</SPAN></P><H2>Old Issues, New Circumstances</H2><P>Concerns about environmental degradation are as old as Soviet industrial development of the <SPAN class=""caps"">AZRF.</SPAN> But “the conditions for addressing them have changed,” noted Kharlampieva. “Now, private companies are involved, decision-making processes are more complex, [and] inter-ministerial, governmental and societal relations have transformed.”</P><P><SPAN class=""s1"">The Soviet government had a wide breadth of experience in environmental policymaking, she added. Kharlampieva hopes that “this experience can continue to inform current and future government standards, in a new structural and economic context.” But to her, “the newest stage of development of the <SPAN class=""caps"">AZRF</SPAN> has hardly begun at a massive scale, so it is too early to evaluate the efficiency of the related environmental measures.”</SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""s1"">To a great extent, the efficiency of top-down measures will depend on the willingness and the ability of regional, local and commercial actors to implement them. Like many other areas of policy in Russia, there is an enormous discrepancy between the rules and practices of environmental policy. “Strict implementation of new legal norms will depend on improvements in legalawareness among the population, service providers, industrial actors, etc.” said Kharlampieva. At the same time, she does not believe local Arctic populations lack environmental awareness: “Environmental risk caused by private companies’ development projects is the main discussion topic at the local level. The population constantly tries to raise these issues with regional and central governments.” The difficulty is that many companies in the field of natural resource exploitation are not legally based in the Arctic. “Therefore, the authority to sanction environmental violators is concentrated in the capitals, where the speed and efficiency of the litigation processes can be a problem,” she put it diplomatically.</SPAN></P><H2>Still a Long Way to Go</H2><P>With the scale of the challenge in mind, is Russia heading in the right direction? As always, the truth lies in the nuances. “We are talking about huge territories with complex issues that cannot be solved in a heartbeat,” said Kharlampieva, calling for patience. She praised the experience, quality and level of integration of the Russian scientific community, including those in natural and social sciences, which she described as moving toward a comprehensive approach to environmental and socioeconomic issues of the <SPAN class=""caps"">AZRF.</SPAN> Both Kharlampieva and Lagutina also praised civil society organizations, such as the World Wildlife Fund, which conducts awareness campaigns, cooperates with regional and local authorities and works, in part, with the support of and subsidies from the Russian federal government.</P><P><SPAN class=""s1"">Yet it must be noted that the environmental question is still framed in rather narrow terms in Russia. Environmental risk in the Arctic is mostly understood by decision-makers in terms of immediate <mark>pollution</mark> by local actors rather than in broader terms of <mark>climate change</mark> and transnational challenges. Environmental awareness among the Russian population at large is also limited. To Lagutina, this disconnect is logical. “Only in politically and economically stable countries do people care about ecology,” she said. “When you are [primarily] concerned with earning enough to get by, the environment does not make it to your priority list.” Notably, Russia has not yet ratified the 2016 Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement, and President Vladimir Putin maintains a disquietingly ambiguous stance on <mark>climate</mark> change.</SPAN></P><P>With the Kremlin focused on other issues in domestic and international affairs, a reassessment of the fossil fuel-based economy to emphasize <mark>sustainable</mark> energy production and consumption seems far away in Russia, as it does in many other parts of the world. In the meantime, environmental issues in the Russian Arctic will continue to be addressed assiduously, but in a manner driven by immediate needs and short-term solutions.</P><P class=""fin""><A href=""http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2017/05/17/pragmatic-environmentalism-russian-arctic"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow""><I>This article</I></A><I> originally appeared at World Policy’s </I><A href=""http://www.worldpolicy.org/arctic-context"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow""><I>Arctic in Context</I></A><I>blog.</I></P></DIV></DIV><ASIDE class=""sidebar""><SECTION class=""widget related""><HEADER><H3>Related Articles</H3></HEADER></SECTION></ASIDE></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

Those policies are steering the nation in precisely the wrong direction. Flooding the market in this way with the most damaging oil resources could tip the <mark>carbon</mark> scales toward <mark>climate</mark> overload.

Today, the Russian oil industry—<mark>Rosneft</mark>, Gazprom, Lukoil, and others—rivals the major global oil companies, including ExxonMobil, BP, and Shell in <A href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2012/07/16/the-worlds-25-biggest-oil-companies/"">resource holdings and profitability</A>. They are the crown jewels of Putin’s Russia: bringing in billions in state revenue, serving as the lifeblood of Siberian company towns, and standing at the helm of the Kremlin modernization effort.</P><P>Throughout the czarist, Soviet, and now modern periods, there have been sensational booms and catastrophic busts. Since 1960, Russian production of conventional crude oil has fluctuated markedly (see figure 1). </P><P>At its peak in 1987, Soviet oil output stood at a world high of 11.4 million barrels a day. In the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse, oil production dwindled to a low of 6 million barrels a day in 1996. With plummeting production stemming from the widespread economic disarray of the 1990s compounded by falling international oil prices, major Russian oil companies—<mark>Rosneft</mark>, Lukoil, TNK-BP, Surgutneftegas—had little incentive for oil exploration. As a result, most of the current operational Russian oil fields were discovered before 1970 in Western Siberia. </P><P>At the start of the new century, the industry rebounded. Production was increased simply by restoring existing capacity to levels near their Soviet-era peaks. Over the past decade, <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/business/global/russian-oil-industry-at-a-crossroads-as-infrastructure-ages.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;"">Russian oil production</A> has continued to migrate upward. </P><P>Today, Russia vies with Saudi Arabia for the title of world’s largest oil producer. But Russia’s current proven reserves do not contain nearly as much oil as Saudi Arabia’s or even North America’s. Moreover, unlike Saudi Arabia, Russia is producing oil full bore without spare capacity. As such, many perceive the Russian oil sector to be, once again, on the precipice of a major decline. Production costs are increasing, and production volumes from Soviet-era conventional oil plays (also known as brown fields) is stagnating. </P><P>Russia also has an array of untapped resources, including oils in remote new green fields that contain plentiful reserves but are expensive to develop and distant from existing infrastructure. The former Soviet Union took great interest in developing early-generation technologies to produce these oils, going as far as to fracture shale rocks using underground nuclear blasts in the Timan-Pechora Basin in the 1960s. Geologists identified these difficult-to-recover unconventional oils but left them in the ground for future generations to manage. And that is the challenge Russia now faces.</P><H3>New Russian Oils on the Horizon</H3><P>The world is gradually running out of conventional, relatively easy-to-access crude oil.  Because of that, Russia, along with other states, has been operating under the assumption that its remaining oil reserves are destined to become increasingly more <mark>carbon</mark> intensive in the future. Such heavy oils have fundamentally different physical and chemical compositions and are, therefore, more difficult to handle and more damaging to the environment than conventional crude. But new developments worldwide are identifying less heavy (and often quite light) tight oil plays that are more conventional in their makeups but unconventional in their production. </P><P>Russia needs to take stock of the opportunities and challenges of its growing supplies of heterogeneous oils in order to decide its new priorities. (See figure 2 for a map of Russia’s oil reserves.) In 2000, Russia’s oil balance was 83 percent light sweet crude, 15 percent heavy oil, and 2 percent extra-heavy bitumen—an ancient oil that has been degraded by bacteria, leaving it solid like tar. By 2020, Russia’s oil shares are projected to shift. <A href=""http://www.oilandgaseurasia.ru/tech_trend/%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5-%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%B8-%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BA%D1%80%D1%8B%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8E%D1%82-%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%83-%D0%B2-%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%B5"">Heavy oil will double</A> to 30 percent, bitumen will swell to 20 percent, and the result will be <A href=""http://www.oilandgaseurasia.ru/tech_trend/%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5-%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%B8-%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BA%D1%80%D1%8B%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8E%D1%82-%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%83-%D0%B2-%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%B5"">equal shares of light and heavy oils</A>.</P><H4>Map</H4><P> </P><P>This forecast, however, does not fully consider the prospects for Russia’s tight oils, which are found in rock formations of relatively low porosity and permeability. Like the recent light-tight-oil boom in North America made possible by hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, Russia stands to unlock a new class of previously unattainable tight oils. </P><P>They serve as an alternative to the even-riskier Arctic oil gambit, which poses a myriad of operating challenges, such as unpredictable weather conditions that could heighten operational risks and confound spill responses. At the same time, tight oils are less <mark>carbon</mark> intensive and damaging than bitumen. </P><P>Arctic developments have taken center stage recently as the “fourth generation of Russian oils,” but tapping into tight oils might provide the opportunity for Russia to maintain current levels of production. In 2010, the Russian Ministry of Energy’s “<A href=""http://www.energystrategy.ru/projects/docs/ES-2030_(Eng).pdf"">Energy Strategy for Russia 2030</A>” projected at least 40 million metric tons of oil coming from tight shale plays, out of 500–530 million metric tons of annual production.<SUP>1</SUP> This small share of current production does not convey the true potential of Russian tight oils, given the large volume of oil in place. </P><P>Russia has several known tight-oil formations in Western Siberia. The well-known <A href=""http://www.oilandgaseurasia.ru/tech_trend/газпром-нефти-вдохновляет- пример-сша"">Bazhenov Formation</A>, with current estimates as high as <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/03/russia-shale-idUSL5N0CP24R20130403"">140 billion metric tons of oil in place</A>, is believed to be even larger than North America’s Bakken Formation. Located in North Dakota, the Bakken contains one of the largest known plays of light-tight oil with as much as an estimated 70 billion metric tons of <A href=""http://www.undeerc.org/bakken/oilproduction.aspx"">tight oil in place</A>. Tight oil is also found in the Abalakskaya and Frolovskaya Formations in Western Siberia. While not all of this oil in place is technically recoverable, it still represents a vast new resource potential.</P><P>Within the class of tight oils, however, there is significant variation, and these resources may be somewhat different than their North American counterparts. They appear to be not quite as light, to require more energy to extract, and to be even more remote than those in the United States. Despite frequent comparisons, the upper Bazhenov in particular contains tight oil that is more viscous and resistant to flow than the <A href=""ftp://ftp.eia.doe.gov/petroleum/0617.pdf"">ultralight U.S. tight oil formations</A>. Still, Russia’s tight oil is in the sweet spot to replace <A href=""http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=7079360"">dwindling light crudes</A>.<SUP>2</SUP> </P><P>Russia also possesses significant <A href=""http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs070-03/fs070-03.html"">bitumen resources</A>, estimated at 35 billion metric tons, with an additional estimated 29 billion metric tons deposited in remote parts of Eastern Siberia.<A href=""http://www.oilandgaseurasia.ru/tech_trend/татарстан-делает-ставку-на тяжелую-нефть""> Tatarstan</A> alone may have 7 billion metric tons of bitumen. But these plays are very deep—up to 1,000 meters (3,280 feet). They cannot be accessed by mining and require massive volumes of steam injected deep underground to heat and liquefy the bitumen. This necessitates large inputs of water and natural gas.</P><P>Despite their geologic challenges, regional bitumen plays have been under development in Tatarstan since 2006. Today Tatneft, an oil and gas company in Tatarstan, is using techniques similar to the ones pioneered in Alberta, Canada, to recover bitumen from almost 300 meters (985 feet) underground. </P><P>In addition to tight oils and bitumen, Russia is home to kerogen or oil shale, an immature oil resource that is made up of chemical compounds found in the organic matter of sedimentary rocks. There are <A href=""http://techplace.datapages.com/data/bulletns/1992-93/data/pg/0077/0005/0850/0863.htm"">kerogen deposits</A> in the upper regions of the Bazhenov Formation. But kerogen is even more energy intensive, <mark>carbon</mark> concentrated, and difficult to extract and process than bitumen.</P><H3>Barriers to Unlocking Russian Oils</H3><P>Russia has numerous new oils to choose from, each with resource characteristics and extraction challenges that differ both from one another and from the conventional crude that has dominated the industry over the past century. In attempting to access Russia’s future oil supplies, companies will be confronted with adopting new production techniques as well as new refining processes. Russia’s existing fiscal, foreign investment, and institutional arrangements cannot adequately address the changing oil landscape. Moscow will have to adapt its existing system to manage these opportunities wisely and safely.</P><P>Perhaps the biggest immediate challenge facing the Russian oil sector is the acute need to increase the share of oil rents that are invested back into the industry. Without adequate reinvestment, efficiency gains in the sector will stall, responsible practices will not be established, production declines will set in, and the sector will be forced to rely on more damaging, low-quality oils. </P><P>The tax system in Russia is also working against the development of new higher-quality oil resources. The Russian government currently <A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-15/russia-may-boost-february-oil-export-tax-1-9-on-urals-increase.html"">taxes conventional oil</A> at high rates, with a $55 per barrel <A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-28/russia-to-lower-crude-export-tax-4-5-in-april-after-urals-falls.html"">standard export duty</A>. The tax rates have not dissuaded Russian oil companies from spending on capital maintenance and reserve replenishment, but hefty duties can have an impact on new hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s, which require fiscal incentives (or lower disincentives) to increase production efficiency and adherence to environmental standards. To encourage extraction and production of new hydro<mark>carbon</mark> resources, bitumen has been exempt from the <A href=""http://www.oilandgaseurasia.ru/tech_trend/инновационные-технологии-открывают-дорогу-в-будущее"">tax on natural resources</A> since 2007. The Russian government is also considering field-by-field <A href=""http://minenergo.gov.ru/press/fold15/13680.html"">tax breaks</A>, with the most difficult-to-extract resources getting the biggest benefits, ranging from a complete exemption for ten years to a <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/18/russia-oil-tax-idUSL6N0C7FLT20130318"">50 percent tax break for five years</A>. This is counterproductive considering that there are easier and less damaging oils available to access.</P><P>To develop these oils, the Russian government prefers large, integrated projects with major state involvement and highly capitalized companies. <mark>Rosneft</mark> has <A href=""http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/<mark>rosneft</mark>-and-exxon-sign-tight-oil-300m-deal/472790.html"">signed with ExxonMobil</A> to develop tight oil in the United States, which will provide valuable know-how for domestic tight oil plays. ExxonMobil has also agreed to partner with <mark>Rosneft</mark> to develop Russia’s Bazhenov field. Other foreign oil companies, such as Royal Dutch Shell and Statoil, have either entered into or are considering signing agreements to jointly explore and develop Russian tight oils. And Gazprom is developing the Achimov condensate field in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug through its sister company, Gazpromneft. </P><P>However, Russian oil companies could face challenges as they shift from producing conventional oil from large fields to managing a myriad of smaller, unconventional plays. While some small firms, like Irkutsk Oil, have made a foray into privately leased conventional oil formations in Eastern Siberia, most have not yet ventured into tight-oil production. Petroneft in Tomsk Oblast is among the first to produce tight oil. </P><P>Foreign investors—big and small—are central to this process of developing tight oils. As independent oil producers look to attract foreign capital, they will want to replicate the business models of successful Western companies that have prospered from the shale gas revolution in the United States. Russia’s business environment will need to become more hospitable to smaller, independent companies that need to navigate uncertain conditions, assume high risks, and endure small production volumes associated with tight oil plays.</P><P>Finally, institutional arrangements regarding resource ownership create barriers in Russia to new oil development. Unlike in the United States, where natural resources not located on public lands are private property, the Russian state owns all of the hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s in the ground. This creates little incentive for small firms to explore for unconventional oil since there is no guarantee they would be able to lease the territory on which oil was discovered. </P><H3>Building the Right Infrastructure </H3><P>The infrastructure in which Russia reinvests will profoundly affect the nation’s oil supply chain, from production to refining to product exports. Beyond raw oil inputs themselves, changes in the global demand for lighter, less <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive, cleaner petroleum products will challenge the current Russian oil establishment. </P><P>The Russian refining sector, despite being third largest in global capacity (behind the United States and China), has only recently begun to be modernized. Russian refineries currently produce a disproportionately large share of dirty, <A href=""http://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/WPM_48.pdf""><mark>carbon</mark>-heavy fuel oils</A>, which has nearly tripled in volume since 2000. A reason for this, beyond older infrastructure, is that Russia taxes its unprofitable refined heavy oil at a lower rate than light oil—and a much lower rate than crude—in order to support <A href=""http://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/WPM_48.pdf"">demand for low-quality petroleum products</A>. Products could further degrade if Russia preferentially develops its bitumen and kerogen, which have very high <mark>carbon</mark> contents and favor production of a very heavy range of products compared to tight oils.</P><P>Russian refineries tend to produce low-value products. The United States, by comparison, has expensive, <A href=""http://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/WPM_48.pdf"">complex refining capabilities</A> in which difficult feedstocks are transformed into high-value products.<SUP>3</SUP> The EU, meanwhile, is talking about shuttering its refineries, which would ultimately make Russia’s closest trade partners dependent on imports of petroleum products from global refiners.</P><P><A href=""http://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/WPM_48.pdf"">Refinery upgrades</A> are slowly enhancing Russia’s product quality. With high demand for lower sulfur diesel fuel both in Europe and Asia, Russia needs to reduce the amount of heavy fuel oils it produces and increase the share of more valuable refined petroleum products that can meet more stringent environmental standards. </P><H3>Factoring <mark>Climate Change</mark> Into Decisionmaking</H3><P>The precipitous collapse of the industrial base following the breakup of the Soviet Union has made it possible for Russia to meet even the most ambitious <mark>carbon</mark>-emissions-reduction goals with little to no effort. This has generated an attitude of complacency within the Kremlin that—along with dependence on oil rents, an energy-intensive economy, and the slow pace of energy-efficiency reforms—prevents Russia from being a leader in efforts to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Moscow cannot remain ambivalent about <mark>climate change</mark>. Global warming will both impact and be affected by oil decisionmaking in Russia. Evidence suggests that the effects of greenhouse gases are more drastic in the country’s northern latitudes, where the bulk of the current Russian oil exploration and production efforts are centered. </P><P>According to the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring, <A href=""http://www.arctic-info.com/Analytics/Page/the-consequences-of-arctic-warming--weather-anomalies-and-the-northern-sea-route-opening--monitoring-of-federal-media-on-march-25-31st--2013-"">Russia’s average temperature is rising</A> at twice the global average rate, with some parts of Siberia warming at three times the global rate. The <A href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/02/130221143910.htm"">melting of permafrost</A> has already resulted in economic costs and could pose a major challenge to existing pipelines and drilling rigs, making future infrastructure projects significantly more expensive and difficult to operate safely. This is especially the case in regions such as the Yamal Peninsula, which the melting of the permafrost would turn into a marshy bog in the summers that would lack the firm foundation needed to support infrastructure and make the region less accessible to oil development. </P><P>In addition, costly Arctic drilling—estimates on the <A href=""http://www.ssb.no/a/publikasjoner/pdf/DP/dp645.pdf"">economic viability of Arctic oil</A> range from as low as $75 dollars per barrel to well over $100 dollars—risks damaging ice sheets, releasing methane stored in permafrost, and tampering with fragile <mark>carbon</mark> sinks that are integral for the earth’s natural <mark>carbon</mark>-sequestration mechanism. </P><P>Russia has access to a variety of oils, which allows it to be selective about its unconventional oil plays. <mark>Climate change</mark> must be factored into the long-run costs of making oil investments. It behooves Russia to avoid investing in the most damaging oil resources. They could ultimately have to compete with less <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive oils in addition to future <mark>climate</mark> regulations. </P><H3>What Lies Ahead for Russian Oil</H3><P>High <A href=""http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Scenarios_RussianFederation_Report_2013.pdf"">global oil prices</A> have led to complacency about instituting reforms, improving the tax regime, and addressing <mark>climate</mark> concerns in Russia. Today Russia derives 40 percent of its federal budget from <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/business/global/russian-oil-industry-at-a-crossroads-as-infrastructure-ages.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;"">oil rents</A>. The Russian Federation relies on oil prices to remain at or above <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/28/us-russia-summit-economy-idUSBRE88R0Q920120928"">$110 dollars per barrel</A> to balance its federal budget. Yet with major increases in overall government spending and pressures from declining crude production in Western Siberia, Russia’s oil-rentier system is in need of a dramatic overhaul. </P><P>Russia needs to diversify from a commodity-driven economy, a reality that is not lost on the Kremlin but is incredibly difficult to achieve. And there is an immediate need to channel current investments into the most <mark>sustainable</mark> and safe new oil plays. One path forward is to prioritize Russian oil developments based on their <mark>climate</mark> impacts, subsidize the development of less <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive fuels, and promote economy-wide energy efficiency. </P><P>Russia will also likely have to reconsider development in the Arctic. Due to the extraordinary complexity of extracting oil in the Arctic, developing in this extreme environment is predicated on high, stable oil prices. Yet the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts that <A href=""http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/er/early_prices.cfm"">global oil prices</A> through 2040 could fluctuate from as low as $60 dollars per barrel to as high as $250 dollars per barrel. Estimates in this time frame have <A href=""http://www.exxonmobil.com/Corporate/energy_outlook.aspx"">global oil supplies swelling</A> by at least 6 million barrels per day—or even twice that production rate. Although political instability in the Middle East and the uptick in global demand are making it unlikely that oil prices will collapse, the uncertainty suggests that costly forays into the Arctic should be permanently placed on hold. Similar problematic forecasts can be made for challenging extra-heavy bitumen and kerogen oil resources.</P><P>Instead, Russia should focus first on developing those oils with the lowest external costs—smallest environmental impacts and <mark>carbon</mark> footprints. Onshore tight oils may be easier to handle and less <mark>carbon</mark> intensive than Arctic resources, serving as a more cost-effective and ecologically manageable option. As such, the Russian government needs to <A href=""http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article1317997.ece"">institute incentives</A> for tight-oil exploration, remove subsidies for dirty fuels, reinvest in high-quality fuel-refining capacity, and bolster transparent data collection to ensure that <mark>carbon</mark> footprints of these oils are minimized.</P><P>As the world grapples with the blessings and curses of a new bounty of hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s, Russia can provide global leadership by successfully navigating this new oil frontier. The prudent path for Russia is to invest in an economically and environmentally sound course for its diverse array of hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s.</P><H3>Notes</H3><P><SUP>1 </SUP>Multiply by 7.33 to convert units of measure from metric tons oil to barrels of oil.</P><P><SUP>2 </SUP>Tight oil in the Bazhenov ranges from 30°–45°API gravity compared to U.S. light to ultralight tight oils with gravities of 45°–75°.</P><P><SUP>3 </SUP>The Nelson complexity index measures a refinery’s secondary conversion capacity relative to the primary distillation capacity and is an indication of how complex a nation’s refining capacity is.

The future of the Paris <mark>climate change</mark> agreement is now more uncertain than ever, which throws more obstacles in the way of transitioning to renewables. France’s environment minister went so far as to <A href=""https://theintercept.com/2017/06/01/trump-putin-form-axis-mass-destruction-<mark>climate</mark>-french-minister-fears/"">warn</A> that the United States and Russia could be the “axis of mass destruction” by advancing fossil fuel interests at the expense of global stability. </P><P>But as unique as this historic moment is, in many ways, Putin has been here before. </P><P>Trump is Putin’s fourth American president and Paris is his second massive <mark>climate</mark> agreement. The Russian leader is neither as overt nor as consistent in his <mark>climate change</mark> denial as Trump, but he’s long played the contrarian to cast doubt on the science and seriousness of the issue. What distinguishes him from Trump is his unpredictability; Putin has always lagged behind the world’s pulse on <mark>climate change</mark>, yet he hasn’t actively disrupted international agreements in the way the United States has. Instead, he’s capitalized on the instability, especially when the United States has either retreated  or completely reversed itself on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Following the news that Trump intends to withdraw the United States from its Paris <mark>climate</mark> commitments in four years’ time, Putin has continued his long-standing tradition of hedging his bets in relation to American leadership around this issue. </P><P>Putin speculated (in Russian) at the St. Petersburg meeting about the roots for Trump’s dissatisfaction. “Maybe the current president thinks they are not thought all the way through,” he said, while continuing to offer Russian support for the agreement. He took the opportunity for some humor about <mark>climate</mark> science at the American president’s expense. “I should say that we should be grateful to President Trump because today in Moscow, I hear they’re saying it snowed and it’s raining here, very cold, so now we can blame him for that and the American imperialism,” he <A href=""https://news.fastcompany.com/putin-expertly-trolls-trump-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change-and-paris-4039660"">reportedly</A> said, as some in the audience laughed and applauded. </P><P>Other Kremlin officials struck a tone somewhere between lukewarm support and outright skepticism about the future of the accord, which entered into force last fall and which Russia has not yet ratified. Putin’s deputy prime minister reaffirmed Russia’s commitment to eventual ratification,  but other Kremlin aides have gone further to suggest that Russia may reevaluate its position. According to<EM><A href=""http://www.newsweek.com/putin-doesnt-blame-trump-paris-deal-us-must-participate-619738"">Newsweek</A>,</EM> Russian state media reported one aide saying, “It is perfectly evident that without the participation of the United States, the Paris agreement will be unworkable, because the United States is one of the biggest generators of emissions.” </P><P>At times he has called it a great threat, and at others he’s dismissed the science and the seriousness of the consequences, but what does the Russian leader really think of <mark>climate change</mark>? How have his responses shifted over the years? And are they predicated on who happens to be president as much as anything else?  Experts note if he has one basic approach it’s this: Putin tends to capitalize on the chaos of global <mark>climate</mark> politics, and Trump’s presidency presents him with a golden opportunity to do just that.</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote-left"">“It’s a good assumption that they will try to use whether they agree to join Paris or not for geopolitical leverage for other issues.”</ASIDE><P>“I think there’s a lot of uncertainty on how they will play it,” says Andy Bruno, a Russia environmental historian with Northern Illinois University. “It’s a good assumption that they will try to use whether they agree to join Paris or not for geopolitical leverage for other issues.”</P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Russia is a petrostate; its economic growth since the Soviet era has been driven by high prices in oil and gas production. With vast fossil fuel production, it ranks fourth globally in greenhouse gas emissions, after China, the United States, and India; first in the especially potent greenhouse gas, methane; and <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/01/<mark>climate</mark>/us-biggest-<mark>carbon</mark>-polluter-in-history-will-it-walk-away-from-the-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal.html"">third</A> among major countries<A href=""#correction"">*</A> in per capita <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. Its reliance on oil and gas and interests in expanding drilling into the Arctic give Russia reason to stall on the world’s pledges to phase out fossil fuels and its subsidies. </SPAN></P><P>In 2000, when the former KGB spy was less than a year into his presidency, he hosted President Bill Clinton in Moscow for World Environment Day. At that time, 192 countries had participated in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol that capped nations’ <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, but many had yet to ratify, including the United States—though there was still hope it would finally sign on. The two leaders issued a statement on their commitment to tackling global warming, and Clinton <A href=""https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/WCPD-2000-06-12/html/WCPD-2000-06-12-Pg1277"">addressed</A> the Russian legislature: “I hope we will be working closely together on this. In the years ahead in the Kyoto <mark>climate change</mark> treaty we committed ourselves to tie market forces to the fight against global warming…I’m pleased that President Putin and I have agreed to deepen our own cooperation on <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>Russia’s commitments turned out to be in name only. Because of the timing of the fall of communism during 1990—which was the year used by the United Nations <mark>climate</mark> framework as its benchmark—Russia committed itself to particularly weak <mark>climate</mark> targets. But whatever minimum level of cooperation the two nations had on global warming, it didn’t last long. </P><P>Less than a year later, in <A href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/bushs-<mark>co2</mark>-flip-flop-the-surprising-truth-20010510"">2001</A>, the Bush administration, caving to <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jun/08/usnews.<mark>climate</mark>change"">pressure from the fossil fuel industry</A>, declared the Kyoto Protocol “dead.” One unintended consequence was that in doing so, Bush launched Russia into a pivotal role for ensuring that the agreement crossed the threshold of the support of 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions it needed to go into force.</P><P>His former economic adviser Andrei Illarionov—a <mark>climate change</mark> denier who went on to work for Washington’s libertarian Cato Institute—<A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-<mark>climate</mark>change-summit-russia-media-idUSKCN0SN1GI20151029"">says Putin’s aides</A> “did very, very extensive work trying to understand all sides of the <mark>climate</mark> debate” in the early 2000s. Illarionov’s said this review led Putin’s government to believe that humans played a limited role in global warming, which defies mainstream science.  </P><P>By September 2003, it appeared that Russia would also refuse to ratify the Kyoto agreement. At the 2003 World <mark>Climate</mark> Conference in Moscow, Putin <SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ambiguously</SPAN><A href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/putin-demurs-on-greenhouse-pact/"">suggested</A> <mark>climate change</mark> isn’t a serious problem. “They often say, half-jokingly and half-seriously, that Russia is a northern country and if temperatures get warmer by two or three degrees Celsius, it’s not that bad—we could spend less on warm coats and agricultural experts say that grain harvests would increase further,” Putin said. “That may be so, but we must also think about the consequences of global <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>But Russia was famously part of <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/09/copenhagen-tuvalu-protocol-split"">the breakdown</A> in the Copenhagen negotiations of 2009, the first <mark>climate</mark> deal of Barack Obama’s presidency, even as it remained among the bloc of nations that wanted to see Kyoto continue, thanks to its weak expectations for the country compared with<STRONG> </STRONG>other nations that sought a new framework. The change came in 2004, when Russia did ratify Kyoto with the proviso that European members approve Russia’s participation in the World Trade Organization. Illarionov <A href=""http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2005/s1307945.htm"">framed</A> Putin’s decision as a straight transaction having little to do with the environment. “Everybody who was speaking [at the Russian government meeting] was saying that we do understand that the Kyoto protocol does not have any scientific background, and we are making this decision not because the Kyoto protocol is scientifically proven but because we would like to have good relations with Europe, with European countries.”</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote-left""><STRONG>“We are making this decision not because the Kyoto protocol is scientifically proven but because we would like to have good relations with Europe, with European countries.”</STRONG></ASIDE><P>Six years later, at what was arguably the peak of the world’s rallying behind <mark>climate</mark> action in Paris, Putin abruptly shifted his tone. “<mark>Climate change</mark> has become one of the gravest challenges humanity is facing,” he said that December. “Caused by global warming, hurricanes, droughts, floods and other anomalies are the source of economic damage.” He claimed that Russia “has been contributing actively to addressing global warming. Our country is taking the lead.”</P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">That wasn’t technically<STRONG> </STRONG>true—analysts called the country’s pledges <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>actiontracker.org/countries/russianfederation.html"">“inadequate”</A>—yet his strong rhetoric still took observers by surprise. “We didn’t really know where they stood for a lot of the year leading up to Paris because frankly they were very quiet,” says Andrew Light, a senior fellow with World Resources Institute and a former State Department <mark>climate</mark> official. Many were surprised that Russia did not play a spoiler role in the Paris talks. The thinking went that Putin saw where the politics of the issue were headed and decided to come under the banner of <mark>climate</mark> action so as not to be seen as isolated.</SPAN></P><P>This year, he’s downplaying the role humans play in global warming, the Paris agreement, or whether <mark>climate change</mark> is even a problem. “The warming, it had already started by the 1930s, that when there were no such anthropological factors such as emissions and the warming had already started” Putin said at an Arctic forum in March. “Those people who are not in agreement with opponents [of <mark>climate change</mark>] may not be at all silly,” he continued, arguing that the world should “adapt” rather than try to stop it. Two months later, Putin, echoing a longtime <mark>climate</mark> denier point that warming could prove beneficial, t<A class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/30/vladimir-putin-russia-trump-us-<mark>climate</mark>-policy.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" data-href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/30/vladimir-putin-russia-trump-us-<mark>climate</mark>-policy.html"">old CNBC</A>, “<mark>Climate change</mark> brings in more favorable conditions and improves the economic potential of this region.”</P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">His swings on <mark>climate</mark> science don’t surprise environmental historian Bruno, who noted the outsize role fossil fuels play in Russia’s politics and economy. </SPAN>“Putin is going to be as much of an environmentalist as Rex Tillerson, former CEO of Exxon Mobil, is,” Bruno says. “Tillerson had started a <mark>climate policy</mark> at Exxon Mobil and said that the US should remain in Paris, but is deeply committed to burning fossil fuels for the maximum profit of the company. Putin is deeply committed to burning fossil fuels for the sake of the Russian economy.”</P><P><A href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2017/06/trump-will-regret-leaving-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-0/"">As I’ve written before</A>, The US withdrawal on Kyoto “shifted the power dynamics across the world and gave Russia, which signed the agreement, greater leverage in international affairs.” Its retreat on Paris will do the same, no matter what Putin’s end-goal is.</P><P>“I can imagine that [Putin’s] not displeased with what Trump is doing by trying to take measures to destabilize the agreement,” says Light, the former State Department official under Obama. It could help Russia’s efforts to see its sanctions lift, expand Arctic drilling, and extend its influence. US isolation on <mark>climate</mark> is “going to hurt the US with respect to other countries sitting down and negotiating on anything the US is interested in,” and in turn, Trump is “creating a vacuum in parts of the world where we have very clear security interests, not just <mark>climate</mark>, but security in North Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.” </P><P>If Putin’s intent is to have international coalitions reverse or stall on strong <mark>climate change</mark> goals, he may see the US action as moving toward the creation of a formidable group of states that may now stand in the way of collective action. “One thing that many of us are worried about, for example, is [how] a combination of the US under Trump and Saudi Arabia and Russia could really block progress in forums like the G-20,” Light says, noting that the G-20 has become more proactive on <mark>climate change</mark> in the past few years, including in their promise to phase out fossil fuel subsidies.</P><P>Or Putin may continue the approach he used in Kyoto, by making trades to compensate for US inaction, promising <mark>climate</mark> commitments so countries relax sanctions on Russia or adjust foreign policy to advance Russian interests.</P><P>There is the actual possibility that instead of being alarmed at the prospect of global warming, he truly is looking forward to it because it could potentially make offshore drilling more accessible in the oil-rich Russian Arctic, a key area for continued growth of its oil and gas industry. Russia or any country interested in stalling a transition from fossil fuels to renewables has a lot easier time if the leader of the world’s biggest economy is causing chaos.</P><P>“They didn’t want to be isolated,” Light says, “and now they don’t have to be.”</P><P id=""correction""><EM>* Corrected</EM></P></ARTICLE><FOOTER class=""entry-footer""><SECTION id=""mj-article-bottom-membership-widget-3"" class=""widget mj-article-bottom-membership-widget""><H3>FIGHT DISINFORMATION:</H3><P><STRONG>Disinformation is one of the biggest threats our democracy faces.</STRONG> Like our reporting on dark money, it is one of those stories behind all the other stories.</P><P><STRONG>So we want to build a team dedicated to tracking and exposing the forces behind disinformation as a new reporting priority before this fall's midterms.</STRONG> But to do it, we need to raise $100,000 that we didn't plan on before June 30.

Everywhere you look, ice draws the eye, squeezed and chiselled by a unique coincidence of forces. Gormenghastian ice ridges, silver and lapis blue, ice mounds and other frozen contortions are minutely observable in the clear Arctic air. The great glaciers impose order on the icy sprawl, flowing down to a semi-frozen sea.</P><P>The ice cap is still, frozen in perturbation. There is not a breath of wind, no engine's sound, no bird's cry, no hubbub at all. Instead of noise, there is its absence. You feel it as a pressure behind the temples and, if you listen hard, as a phantom roar. For generations of frosty-whiskered European explorers, and still today, the ice sheet is synonymous with the power of nature.</P><ASIDE class=""main-content-container""><DIV class=""secondary-header grey-header size-compact"">Special report</DIV><DIV class=""bottom-links""><A href=""/node/21556794/sources-and-acknowledgments"">Sources &amp; acknowledgments</A><A href=""/rights"">Reprints</A></DIV></ASIDE><P>The Arctic is one of the world's least explored and last wild places. Even the names of its seas and rivers are unfamiliar, though many are vast. Siberia's Yenisey and Lena each carries more water to the sea than the Mississippi or the Nile. Greenland, the world's biggest island, is six times the size of Germany. Yet it has a population of just 57,000, mostly Inuit scattered in tiny coastal settlements. In the whole of the Arctic—roughly defined as the Arctic Circle and a narrow margin to the south (see map)—there are barely 4m people, around half of whom live in a few cheerless post-Soviet cities such as Murmansk and Magadan. In most of the rest, including much of Siberia, northern Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland and northern Scandinavia, there is hardly anyone. Yet the region is anything but inviolate.</P><P><STRONG>Fast forward</STRONG></P><P>A heat map of the world, colour-coded for temperature change, shows the Arctic in sizzling maroon. Since 1951 it has warmed roughly twice as much as the global average. In that period the temperature in Greenland has gone up by 1.5°C, compared with around 0.7°C globally. This disparity is expected to continue. A 2°C increase in global temperatures—which appears inevitable as greenhouse-gas emissions soar—would mean Arctic warming of 3-6°C.</P><P>Almost all Arctic glaciers have receded. The area of Arctic land covered by snow in early summer has shrunk by almost a fifth since 1966. But it is the Arctic Ocean that is most changed. In the 1970s, 80s and 90s the minimum extent of polar pack ice fell by around 8% per decade. Then, in 2007, the sea ice crashed, melting to a summer minimum of 4.3m sq km (1.7m square miles), close to half the average for the 1960s and 24% below the previous minimum, set in 2005. This left the north-west passage, a sea lane through Canada's 36,000-island Arctic Archipelago, ice-free for the first time in memory.</P><P>Scientists, scrambling to explain this, found that in 2007 every natural variation, including warm weather, clear skies and warm currents, had lined up to reinforce the seasonal melt. But last year there was no such remarkable coincidence: it was as normal as the Arctic gets these days. And the sea ice still shrank to almost the same extent.</P><P>There is no serious doubt about the basic cause of the warming. It is, in the Arctic as everywhere, the result of an increase in heat-trapping atmospheric gases, mainly <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide released when fossil fuels are burned. Because the atmosphere is shedding less solar heat, it is warming—a physical effect predicted back in 1896 by Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish scientist. But why is the Arctic warming faster than other places?</P><P>Consider, first, how very sensitive to temperature change the Arctic is because of where it is. In both hemispheres the <mark>climate</mark> system shifts heat from the steamy equator to the frozen pole. But in the north the exchange is much more efficient. This is partly because of the lofty mountain ranges of Europe, Asia and America that help mix warm and cold fronts, much as boulders churn water in a stream. Antarctica, surrounded by the vast southern seas, is subject to much less atmospheric mixing.</P><P>The land masses that encircle the Arctic also prevent the polar oceans revolving around it as they do around Antarctica. Instead they surge, north-south, between the Arctic land masses in a gigantic exchange of cold and warm water: the Pacific pours through the Bering Strait, between Siberia and Alaska, and the Atlantic through the Fram Strait, between Greenland and Norway's Svalbard archipelago.</P><P>That keeps the average annual temperature for the high Arctic (the northernmost fringes of land and the sea beyond) at a relatively sultry -15°C; much of the rest is close to melting-point for much of the year. Even modest warming can therefore have a dramatic effect on the region's ecosystems. The Antarctic is also warming, but with an average annual temperature of -57°C it will take more than a few hot summers for this to become obvious.</P><P><STRONG>The albedo effect</STRONG></P><P>The efficient north-south mixing of air may also play a part in the Arctic's amplified warming. The winds that rush northwards carry pollutants, including soot from European and Asian smokestacks, which has a powerful warming effect over snow. In recent decades there has also been a rise in levels of mercury, a by-product of burning coal, in the tissues of beluga whales, walruses and polar bears, all of which the Inuit eat. This is another reason why the Arctic is not virgin.</P><P>But the main reason for Arctic amplification is the warming effect of replacing light-coloured snow and ice with darker-coloured land or water. Because dark surfaces absorb more heat than light ones, this causes local warming, which melts more snow and ice, revealing more dark land or water, and so on. Known as the albedo effect, this turns out to be a more powerful positive feedback than most researchers had expected. Most <mark>climate</mark> models predicted that the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in summer by the end of this century; an analysis published in 2009 in <EM class=""Italic"">Geophysical Research Letters</EM> suggested it might happen as early as 2037. Some now think it will be sooner.</P><P>It is hard to exaggerate how dramatic this is. Perhaps not since the felling of America's vast forests in the 19th century, or possibly since the razing of China's and western Europe's great forests a thousand years before that, has the world seen such a spectacular environmental change. The consequences for Arctic ecosystems will be swingeing.</P><P>As their ancient ice buffers vanish, Arctic coastlines are eroding; parts of Alaska are receding at 14 metres (45 feet) a year. Niche habitats, such as meltwater pools on multi-year ice, are dwindling. Some highly specialised Arctic species will probably become extinct as their habitats shrink and southern interlopers rush in. Others will thrive. The early signs of this biological reshuffle are already evident. High-Arctic species, including the polar bear, are struggling. Species new to the region, such as mackerel and Atlantic cod, are coming up in Arctic trawler nets. Yet the shock waves of Arctic change will be felt much more widely.</P><P>Melting sea ice will not affect global sea levels, because floating ice displaces its own mass in seawater. But melting glaciers will, and the Arctic's are shedding ice at a great rate. Greenland's ice cap is losing an estimated 200 gigatonnes of ice a year, enough to supply a billion people with water. The Arctic's smaller ice caps and glaciers together are losing a similar amount. Before this became clear, the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) had predicted a sea-level rise of up to 59cm during this century. Given what is happening up north, many now think this too modest.</P><DIV class=""pullquote"">Melting sea ice will not affect global sea levels, because floating ice  displaces its own mass in seawater. But melting glaciers will</DIV><P>A wilder fear is that a deluge of Arctic meltwater could disrupt the mighty “overturning circulation” of the global oceans, the exchange of warm tropical and cold polar water. It has happened before, at least seven times in the past 60,000 years, and needs watching. But recent evidence suggests that such a calamity is not imminent. Another concern, that thawing Arctic permafrost could release vast quantities of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and methane, looms larger. That, too, has happened before, around 55m years ago, leading to a global temperature increase of 5°C in a few thousand years.</P><P>Such risks are hard to pin down, and possibly small. Many elements of the change in the Arctic, including the rates of snow melt and glacier retreat, are still within the range of historical variations. Yet the fact that the change is man-made is unprecedented, which introduces huge uncertainty about how far and fast it will proceed. For those minded to ignore the risks, it is worth noting that even the more extreme predictions of Arctic warming have been outpaced by what has happened in reality.</P><P><STRONG>Riches of the north</STRONG></P><P>In the long run the unfrozen north could cause <mark>devastation</mark>. But, paradoxically, in the meantime no Arctic species will profit from it as much as the one causing it: humans. Disappearing sea ice may spell the end of the last Eskimo cultures, but hardly anyone lives in an igloo these days anyway. And the great melt is going to make a lot of people rich.</P><DIV class=""content-image-float clearfix"" style=""width: 290px;""><SPAN class=""caption"">Watch our <A href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/09/melting-arctic-sea-ice-and-shipping-routes""><STRONG>animation</STRONG></A> of the receding Arctic ice-shelf and the shipping routes it could unlock</SPAN></DIV><P>As the frozen tundra retreats northwards, large areas of the Arctic will become suitable for agriculture. An increasingly early Arctic spring could increase plant growth by up to 25%. That would allow Greenlanders to grow more than the paltry 100 tonnes of potatoes they manage now. And much more valuable materials will become increasingly accessible. The Arctic is already a big source of minerals, including zinc in Alaska, gold in Canada, iron in Sweden and nickel in Russia, and there is plenty more to mine.</P><P>The Arctic also has oil and gas, probably lots. Exploration licences are now being issued across the region, in the United States, Canada, Greenland, Norway and Russia. On April 18th ExxonMobil finalised the terms of a deal with Russia's <mark>Rosneft</mark> to invest up to $500 billion in developing offshore reserves, including in Russia's Arctic Kara sea. Oil companies do not like to talk about it, but this points to another positive feedback from the melt. <mark>Climate change</mark> caused by burning fossil fuels will allow more Arctic hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s to be extracted and burned.</P><P>These new Arctic industries will not emerge overnight. There is still plenty of sea ice to make the north exceptionally tough and expensive to work in; 24-hour-a-day winter darkness and Arctic cyclones make it tougher still. Most of the current exploration is unlikely to lead to hydro<mark>carbon</mark> production for a decade at least. But in time it will happen. The prize is huge, and oil companies and Arctic governments are determined to claim it. Shortly before the ExxonMobil-<mark>Rosneft</mark> deal was announced, Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, announced plans to make it much more attractive for foreigners to invest in Russian offshore energy production. “Offshore fields, especially in the Arctic, are without any exaggeration our strategic reserve for the 21st century,” he said.</P><P>For half the 20th century the Arctic, as the shortest route between Russia and America, was the likeliest theatre for a nuclear war, and some see potential for fresh conflict in its opening. Russia and Canada, the two biggest Arctic countries by area, have encouraged this fear: the Arctic stirs fierce nationalist sentiment in both. With a new regard to their northern areas, some of the eight Arctic countries are, in a modest way, remilitarising them. Norway shifted its military command centre to the Arctic town of Reitan in 2009. Russia is replacing and upgrading its six nuclear icebreakers, a piece of civilian infrastructure with implications for security too. Yet this special report will suggest that warnings about Arctic conflict are, like the <mark>climate</mark>, overcooked.</P><P>The Arctic is no <EM class=""Italic"">terra nullius</EM>. Unlike Antarctica, which is governed by an international treaty, most of it is demarcated. Of half a dozen territorial disputes in the region, the biggest is probably between the United States and Canada, over the status of the north-west passage. Those two countries will not go to war. And the majority of Arctic countries are members of NATO.</P><P>Yet the melting Arctic will have geostrategic consequences beyond helping a bunch of resource-fattened countries to get fatter. An obvious one is the potentially disruptive effect of new trade routes. Sailing along the coast of Siberia by the north-east passage, or Northern Sea Route (NSR), as Russians and mariners call it, cuts the distance between western Europe and east Asia by roughly a third. The passage is now open for four or five months a year and is getting more traffic. In 2010 only four ships used the NSR; last year 34 did, in both directions, including tankers, refrigerated vessels carrying fish and even a cruise liner.</P><P>Asia's big exporters, China, Japan and South Korea, are already investing in ice-capable vessels, or planning to do so. For Russia, which has big plans to develop the sea lane with trans-shipment hubs and other infrastructure, this is a double boon. It will help it get Arctic resources to market faster and also, as the NSR becomes increasingly viable, diversify its hydro<mark>carbon</mark>-addicted economy.</P><P>There are risks in this, of dispute if not war, which will require management. What is good for Russia may be bad for Egypt, which last year earned over $5 billion in revenues from the Suez Canal, an alternative east-west shipping route. So it is good that the regional club, the Arctic Council, is showing promise. Under Scandinavian direction for the past half-decade, it has elicited an impressive amount of Arctic co-operation, including on scientific research, mapping and resource development.</P><P>Yet how to reconcile the environmental risks of the melting Arctic with the economic opportunities it will present? The shrinkage of the sea ice is no less a result of human hands than the ploughing of the prairies. It might even turn out as lucrative. But the costs will also be huge. Unique ecosystems, and perhaps many species, will be lost in a tide of environmental change. The cause is global <mark>pollution</mark>, and the risks it carries are likewise global. The Arctic, no longer distant or inviolable, has emerged, almost overnight, as a powerful symbol of the age of man.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
