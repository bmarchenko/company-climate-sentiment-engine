Here, we used an ensemble of 26 process-based wheat models applied at sites across a European transect to compare their sensitivity to changes in temperature (-2 to +9°C) and precipitation (-50 to +50%). Model results were analysed by plotting them as impact response surfaces (IRSs), classifying the IRS patterns of individual model simulations, describing these classes and analysing factors that may explain the major differences in model responses.The model ensemble was used to simulate yields of winter and spring wheat at four sites in Finland, Germany and Spain. Results were plotted as IRSs that show changes in yields relative to the baseline with respect to temperature and precipitation. IRSs of 30-year means and selected extreme years were classified using two approaches describing their pattern.The expert diagnostic approach (EDA) combines two aspects of IRS patterns: location of the maximum yield (nine classes) and strength of the yield response with respect to <mark>climate</mark> (four classes), resulting in a total of 36 combined classes defined using criteria pre-specified by experts. The statistical diagnostic approach (SDA) groups IRSs by comparing their pattern and magnitude, without attempting to interpret these features. It applies a hierarchical clustering method, grouping response patterns using a distance metric that combines the spatial correlation and Euclidian distance between IRS pairs. The two approaches were used to investigate whether different patterns of yield response could be related to different properties of the crop models, specifically their genealogy, calibration and process description.Although no single model property across a large model ensemble was found to explain the integrated yield response to temperature and precipitation perturbations, the application of the EDA and SDA approaches revealed their capability to distinguish: (i) stronger yield responses to precipitation for winter wheat than spring wheat; (ii) differing strengths of response to <mark>climate change</mark>s for years with anomalous weather conditions compared to period-average conditions; (iii) the influence of site conditions on yield patterns; (iv) similarities in IRS patterns among models with related genealogy; (v) similarities in IRS patterns for models with simpler process descriptions of root growth and water uptake compared to those with more complex descriptions; and (vi) a closer correspondence of IRS patterns in models using partitioning schemes to represent yield formation than in those using a harvest index.Such results can inform future crop modelling studies that seek to exploit the diversity of multi-model ensembles, by distinguishing ensemble members that span a wide range of responses as well as those that display implausible behaviour or strong mutual similarities.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

| <A href=""http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/author/jmldigest/"" title=""Posts by Jim Lane"" rel=""author"">Jim Lane</A></SPAN></DIV><DIV id=""tps_slideContainer_58127"" class=""theiaPostSlider_slides""><DIV><P><EM>By Vonnie Estes, Special to The Digest</EM></P><P>Around the world, manufacturers make everyday products, from food to containers to fabrics, using processes and ingredients developed decades to centuries ago. These manufacturing systems have enabled impressive economic growth and raised the global standard of living. But as the land, water, and fossil fuel resources those systems rely on become scarcer, biology is offering new ways to engineer solutions.</P><P>Synthetic biology redesigns existing organisms for specific purposes to produce safe products that are more efficient, reliable, and predictable. Engineered microorganisms can make many of the same ingredients used in traditional industrialization processes with less energy and waste and without relying on petroleum derivatives.</P><P>Synthetic biology’s breakthroughs will speed the development of biologically engineered solutions to global problems related to health, materials, energy, and environment. Its approach is multidisciplinary, bringing together biologists, engineers, software developers, chemists, and bioinformatics specialists to understand how genes work together and combine to produce useful applications. SynBio tools make the programming of biology more predictable, more like software.</P><P>This article examines the exciting new tools being developed to solve issues I’ve spent my career tackling. It will give an historic perspective on the use of SynBio to produce advanced biofuels and chemicals; look at new bio-based materials, platforms, and food; and examine what is catching investors’ interest now in industrial biotechnology and agriculture.</P><H4>ADVANCED BIOFUELS</H4><P>My experience with SynBio (before it was called that) began at the start of the advanced biofuels industry around 2005. We were trying to get enzymes to cheaply break down cellulose and hemicellulose and to develop microorganisms to process C5 and C6 sugars for the development of advanced biofuels.</P><P>By 2007 government exuberance was pushing technologies and companies too fast. The DOE backed the funding of six commercial-scale projects for $385M when the biology was barely off the lab bench and no one had drafted engineering plans. Venture capitalists got excited and put too much money into very early stage companies. This is what VCs do – but in this case they expected the companies to scale and commercialize as quickly as software.</P><P>The companies scaled their technology too quickly, skipping important developmental steps. We realized that after investors put $200M into a company, the company then needed an additional $200M to build its first plant. Then, as if high capital costs and scale-up risk were not harmful enough, when the bottom fell out of the energy market during the recession, it took much of the nascent SynBio biofuel industry with it. Followed by new energy sources and tanking oil prices. Competing with $140/barrel oil was one thing, but $50 was impossible.</P><P>Then along came the blend wall and the stalling of the Renewable Fuels Standard. The problem here was not in the biology – it was a systemic failure that no one saw coming soon enough. Many companies went bankrupt and investors closed their doors.</P><P>Today, advanced biofuels technology sits mostly with large, deep-pocketed companies. They have had some successes in building large advanced biofuels plants: Abengoa, DuPont, Poet, Beta Renewables, GranBio. Big, patient companies with other revenue streams can hold and improve the technology until such time as we have policies to support <mark>innovation</mark>. Energy markets are not free markets and don’t properly reward or support <mark>innovation</mark>. Advanced biofuel investors need policy made and maintained by a diverse set of governments. We hope to see such policy agreements come out of Paris this week.</P><H4>PIVOT TO CHEMICALS</H4><P>Challenged by cheap oil, investor fatigue, and technical hurdles, many biofuel companies pivoted to produce alternative chemical products through fermentation. We looked for products with lower costs, lower volume, and higher value, that used biomass and bioprocesses to replace petroleum as the important building block in a number of end products including plastics, lubricants, waxes, and cosmetics.</P><P>Bio-based platform chemicals are now being produced at small scale mostly above the cost of the petroleum-based products they are trying to replace. These chemicals will be at price parity when we get to large-scale production. During product development and certification, products must be tested and approved throughout the supply chain by chemical producers, product manufacturers, brand owners, retailers, and end consumers. Each stakeholder in the supply chain needs to believe the product shows equal to superior performance. Powerful end users like Coca-Cola with their 20% bio-based bottle are a huge help in pulling product through the chain. They are often willing to a pay premium price at the start and can adapt their packaging lines. Each new application of a new or drop-in chemical requires testing and approval that takes time and can’t be rushed by impatient investors.</P><P>Many companies like Amyris and Solazyme are developing ingredients that go into other products, such as flavors and fragrances. As in most biochemical production, the microorganism is removed after fermentation, and at a molecular level, the product is identical non-fermentation product it is made to replace.</P><P>Three companies (Solazyme, Amyris, BioAmber) have gone public and are having to deal with being in the public markets. For the most part, the companies are moving ahead, producing products and making good partnership announcements. Their share price does not reflect their advances. A sample of the companies moving forward:</P><UL><LI>Solazyme – produces oils for healthier foods; better home, personal care, and industrial products; and more <mark>sustainable</mark> fuels. Raised $146M + $200M IPO</LI><LI>Amyris – high-performance renewable products across a range of consumer and industry segments. Raised $417M + $85M IPO</LI><LI>BioAmber – biosuccinic acid. Raised $135M + $80M IPO</LI><LI>Verdezyne – adipic acid and other bio-based chemicals. Raised $67M</LI><LI>Genomatica – butanediol bio-based chemicals. Raised $113M</LI><LI>Myriant – biosuccinic acid. Raised $110M</LI><LI>Evolva – ingredients for health, wellness, and nutrition such as stevia and vanillin. Raised $28 million. Went public through reverse merger with Arpida.</LI></UL><P>Many other companies went into bankruptcy or were purchased (Cobalt, LS9, OPX).</P><H4>NEXT WAVE</H4><P>The collision of digital and biotech has given us tools for faster, cheaper, and better product development. We now have a transformative skill set that allows for quick “design, not discovery” of new products in a predictable fashion. Biology is becoming more software driven using cloud resources, robots, machine learning, and automation. Development can be done in silico.</P><P>Costs for doing work continue to go down – for example, the costs and time requirement for gene editing are falling rapidly. Zinc-finger nucleases cost about $3,000 per gene and take up to a year. Now, using CRISPR/Cas9, the cost is below $500 per gene for a more accurate process that takes only a week. A genome can now be sequenced for under $10,000. These new technologies allow product companies to stay smaller longer without burning as much cash.</P><P>These tools are opening up new company and product possibilities. Three areas of interest (outside of pharma) are platform technology companies, industrial biotech, and agriculture.</P><P><STRONG>Platform technologies</STRONG></P><P>I got a front row seat to the early stages of a platform technology company as a pre-Series A board member of Zymergen. These fast-emerging companies are developing technology to support and enable product companies. In the previous generation of biofuel/biochemical companies, R&amp;D had to staff their own microbiologists, buy their own robots, and develop their own bioinformatics systems. They had to engineer and optimize their own microorganisms to make desired products.</P><P>Now product companies can get superior microbes engineered to order. With more than $100M raised among them this year, Zymergen, Ginkgo Bioworks, Synthace, and Biosynia are relying on a mix of robotic automation, machine learning, novel software, and high-throughput screening to rapidly develop and optimize new strains to produce industrial chemicals and other bio-based products.</P><P>Tool-based companies have caught the eye of investors this year:</P><UL><LI>Zymergen – brings scale and efficiency to the process of strain optimization. Raised $44M</LI><LI>Gingko Bioworks – built organism-engineering foundry to bring new organisms to customers. Raised $54M</LI><LI>Caribou Biosciences – provides solutions for cellular engineering and analysis based on the CRISPR-Cas9. Raised $14.6M</LI><LI>Intrexon – enables products in the health, food, energy, consumer, and environmental industries using platform technology. Primarily in pharma but active in industrial bio and ag. Raised $344M + $160M IPO ($35/share)</LI></UL><P><STRONG>Industrial biotechnology</STRONG></P><P>Many start-ups are focusing on smaller scale, higher value products that do not compete with petroleum or low-margin commodities. These products require less cap-ex and have lower feedstock exposure due to smaller volumes. New products are more likely to help incumbents, not try to replace them. Here are a few examples of these new companies, their products, and money raised to date:</P><UL><LI>Bolt – high-performance fashion fibers. Raised $40M</LI><LI>Gingko – flavors / fragrances. Raised $54M</LI><LI>Modern Meadow – cultured leather and meat products. Raised $11M</LI><LI>Mango Materials – biodegradable plastics from waste biogas</LI></UL><P>An area that has gotten much Silicon Valley investor attention is plant- and fermentation-derived meat, eggs, and dairy replacements. Demand for animal protein is increasing in the developing world, devouring resources and creating waste. The total <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of beef is 4 pounds of greenhouse gases per quarter pound of meat, including all the greenhouse gases released during its production.</P><P>Although taste and consumer acceptance are going to be challenges, animal protein substitutes are a great way to reduce the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. Some companies are developing plant-based products, while others are fermentation-based:</P><UL><LI>Beyond Meat – animal protein from plant protein. Raised $17M</LI><LI>Impossible Foods – meats and cheeses made from plants. Raised $183M</LI><LI>Clara Foods – synthetic egg whites from fermentation. Raised $1.75M</LI><LI>Muufri – synthetic milk from fermentation. Raised $60K</LI></UL><P>As a mentor at IndieBio, an accelerator for synthetic biology start-ups, I’ve seen a number of exciting new companies. Many start-ups are focused on the post-animal bio-economy. Groups are developing organisms to make different kinds of meat, egg and milk proteins, shark fin, and gelatin. These companies have a ways to go and their exits are far from certain. But the new products and technologies will have a positive impact on the environment.</P><P> </P><H4>Agriculture</H4><P>I’ve worked for decades to commercialize advanced biotechnology tools for the development of genetically modified crops using <EM>Agrobacterium</EM> and similar methods. The new focus is on technologies considered non-transgenic in plants, biocontrol products, and plant nutrition to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and toxic inputs, use less land and water, combat pests, and increase soil fertility.</P><P><EM>Feedstock for 2<SUP>nd</SUP> gen fuels/chemicals and power</EM></P><P>As we continue to expand from hydro<mark>carbon</mark>-based products to carbohydrates, we will need better plant sugars using less water, less land, and fewer inputs. As soon as there is a market pull for $20/ton biomass, there will be companies to provide it, likely using new non-GMO tools to produce better crops faster.</P><P><EM>Gene editing, breeding tools</EM></P><P>The big six ag companies – BASF, Bayer CropScience, Dupont, Dow Chemical Company, and Syngenta – have invested millions of dollars in internal R&amp;D for the commercialization of genetically modified crops. They are unlikely to invest equivalent resources in building new gene editing tools to produce improved non-GMO crops. A number of companies are developing platform technologies to make gene editing faster, quicker, and better. Large seed companies will likely license, partner, and acquire these companies. Two in the forefront are Caribou, with CRISPR technology (raised $14.46M), and Cibus, using gene-editing tools to produce herbicide-resistant crops with other traits and crops on the horizon.</P><P>To date three US companies are selling crop products that were engineered using gene editing techniques: Cibus – herbicide-resistant canola; Okanagan Specialty Fruits (acquired by Intrexon) – Arctic apples that resist turning brown when sliced or bruised; J. R. Simplot Company – Innate potatoes that resist bruising and produce less potentially <A href=""http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier"">cancer</A>-causing chemical when fried. Consumer acceptance of the apples and potatoes remains to be seen.</P><P>Regulation of gene editing techniques in crops is still ambiguous, causing some investors to be cautious. The European Commission is debating regulations of the latest techniques, and they may classify plants as GMOs even if they lack foreign DNA. In the United States, modifying plants with <EM>Agrobacterium</EM> requires regulation by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, but plants modified by gene editing (ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas based methods) are not currently regulated. In July, the White House launched a multiyear initiative to review federal regulations on agricultural biotechnology so the rules could change.</P><P><EM>Microbial Solutions: Inoculants, biocontrol, stimulants</EM></P><P>In the beginning of my career, I worked on commercialization of natural biocontrol products produced from sources such as the Neem tree and naturally occurring fungi. We just couldn’t make them financially viable.</P><P>Now scientists can develop new products to improve crop health by discovering, developing, and altering what naturally occurs in the microbiome of plants and soils. Microbial products are made from microbes that work alone or complement traditional methods of plant production and protection. Products can protect crops from pests and disease, combat resistance, and enhance plant productivity and fertility. Inoculant and biocontrol products can be applied on broad acre crops such as corn and soy, and on fruits and vegetables to help plants take up nutrients and defend against pests, disease, and weeds. Novozymes and Monsanto have formed the BioAg Alliance to catalyze the development of new microbial solutions to address this market. In November, Syngenta and DSM announced a collaboration that will focus on creating bio-controls, bio-pesticides, and bio-stimulants. A number of smaller companies are developing technologies as well:</P><UL><LI>AgBiome – researching plant-associated microbiome to discover new biological and trait genes. Raised $34.5M</LI><LI>Symbiota – improve plant health and growth by promoting a healthy microbiome. Raised $7.5M</LI><LI>Agrimetis – natural product-derived compounds to protect crops from weeds, fungal diseases, and insect pests. Raised $7.3M</LI></UL><H4>EXITS</H4><P>A number of IPOs and acquisitions occurred in the first group of biofuels and biochemical companies with varying degrees of shareholder benefit. I was at Codexis, the first of the group to go public, when we IPOed. Codexis and other early IPO companies have remade themselves a number of times and their value is mostly unrecognized in the public markets. Amyris, Solazyme, Codexis, Gevo, and Metabolix are all trading below $3 a share. REG and Bioamber are trading around $8. Without knowing the financial details, it is unlikely the acquisitions of LS9, OPX, Cobalt, and Verenium were major windfalls for investors. Investment and attitudes will shift for this sector as we develop a price scheme for <mark>carbon</mark> to drive the use of non-petroleum-based products and advanced biofuels.</P><P>With all of the seed round and Series A money going into platform, ag, and early-stage biomaterials companies, there is a concern about valuations getting too high and successful routes to exit. Middle-stage capital is missing in this space; medium-size companies have trouble making it to revenues. Raising C or D rounds has been tough. As happens with new asset classes and sectors, most investment firms tracking the industry have yet to build a substantial track record and a route to exit. Private equity firms have played a relatively limited role in the agriculture technology and biomaterials space so far. One of the main reasons is that few of them have been focused on the sector due mostly to the early stage of the companies.</P><P>Two examples of acquisitions include Bayer’s $425M acquisition of AgraQuest, the biologicals company, in June 2012 from Otter Capital and Generation Investment Management. In November 2012, BASF acquired Becker Underwood, a biological seed treatment, from Norwest Equity Partners for $1.02B. A few IPOs have occurred in the ag space including Marrone Bio <mark>Innovation</mark>s, the biopesticide company, and Arcadia Biosciences, the agriculture traits producer. Marrone is currently trading 80% below its IPO price and Arcadia is 65% below IPO price. Both deals were downsized on low demand and priced below initial share price target range.</P><P>Strategic investors like the Big 6 in ag have played a role in building excitement around the sector and its exit potential. Investors outside the industry – giants like Microsoft and Google – could soon become participants and buyers in ag and biomaterials/products. They will make for interesting competitors for incumbents.</P><H4>GOING FORWARD</H4><P>We are in the golden age of biology. With the development of exciting new tools, we can engineer plants and microorganisms to make better, cheaper, and unique products. Many of the solutions I have worked on over my career were not financially viable at the time. We now are able to iterate faster and get to market and revenues more quickly with lower costs. It’s why I never say, “I’ve tried that, it didn’t work.” We just didn’t have the right tools yet. We may never get all segments of the population to say the words “<mark>climate change</mark>,” but society is looking for technologies that make us more resilient and adaptable. This change will help lead us to a price scheme on <mark>carbon</mark>, stimulating investment back into advanced biofuels and chemicals.</P><P>We will adopt new bio-based materials that reduce the demand for protein sources like beef and eggs for a world with more people and fewer resources. Technologies that allow us to produce more food, fuel, and fiber with fewer inputs will make it to market and create shareholder, consumer, and environmental returns.</P><P>In Paris this week the top global leaders announced the launch of “<A href=""http://mission-<mark>innovation</mark>.net/"">Mission <mark>Innovation</mark></A>,” a 20-country initiative to accelerate public and private global clean energy <mark>innovation</mark> to address global <mark>climate change</mark>, provide affordable clean energy to consumers, and create additional commercial opportunities in clean energy. Large-scale penetration of clean energy technologies requires investment by governments followed by private-sector investments.</P><P>The <A href=""http://www.breakthroughenergycoalition.com/"">Breakthrough Energy Coalition</A> has been formed to focus on early-stage <mark>innovation</mark>s alongside the public policy commitments. This parallel initiative – spearheaded by Bill Gates – includes a coalition of more than 28 significant private capital investors from 10 countries pledging to invest extraordinary levels of private capital in clean energy.</P><P>Policy, <mark>innovation</mark>, amazing technologies and scientists/engineers will bring synthetic biology to the forefront in solving the world’s greatest issues – <mark>climate change</mark> and feeding a growing population.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

These growing costs can be attributed to <mark>climate change</mark> to a very limited extent, but cannot yet be linked to anthropogenic emissions (Bouwer <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR4"">2011</A></SPAN>). Yet <mark>climate</mark> projections suggest significant changes in future risk across the EU (Kovats et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR19"">2014</A></SPAN>). This prospect adds to the need for investing in drought and flood risk management today as a way of preparing for future <mark>climate</mark>s and patterns of risk. Where possible, such investments should also aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We examined the potential and challenges for mainstreaming <mark>climate</mark> into EU water and agriculture policies influencing flood and drought risks, focusing on a case study in the Warta river basin of Poland (Bayer et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR2"">2015</A></SPAN>).</P><P id=""Par9"" class=""Para"">The EU has a comprehensive portfolio of policies directly and indirectly addressing flood and drought risk. The most important are the: EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP); EU Water Framework Directive (WFD); EU Floods Directive (FD); EU Water Scarcity and Droughts Strategy (WSDS); and Structural and Cohesion Funds. There are many examples of flood and drought risk adaptation measures, with links to mitigation, mainstreamed into EU policies. For instance, the WFD and FD require flood and drought risk management plans and flood risk assessments that take <mark>climate change</mark> into account, although without specific targets. While CAP does not directly address flood and drought risks, the 2013 CAP reforms present opportunities for mainstreaming. For instance, the CAP cross-compliance regulations can require on-farm measures, such as soil management plans, constructing small retention ponds, planting shelter belts that reduce runoff and changing tillage practices to hold moisture in the soil. These measures not only reduce flooding downstream and provide water in time of drought, but also contribute to mitigation by improving <mark>carbon</mark> sinks. CAP’s agri-environment programme (AEP) compensates farmers for making on-farm water retention and other investments. Off-farm measures, such as large reservoirs, are eligible for co-funding from the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and Structural and Cohesion Funds. As yet, however, these programmes have not been linked in a unified EU policy for flood and drought risk management. EU policies therefore provide a diverse but poorly linked framework for mainstreaming flood and drought risk management in agriculture and water policies.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec4"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1""><H2 class=""Heading"">Protecting European biodiversity in a transient <mark>climate</mark></H2><DIV class=""content""><P id=""Par10"" class=""Para"">While reaching the EU goal of halting biodiversity loss by 2020 is already difficult, <mark>climate change</mark> adds to this challenge. As <mark>climate change</mark>s, localities change in suitability and may become unsuitable to species occurring there today. This can not only lead to reductions and shifts in species distributions, but also breaks in important ecological interactions—increasing extinction risk of species and jeopardising vital ecosystem services, such as pollination.</P><P id=""Par11"" class=""Para"">Van Teeffelen et al. (this issue) briefly review observed and projected impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> for biodiversity. Araújo et al. (<SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR1"">2011</A></SPAN>) specifically explored the expected impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on the main EU biodiversity policy outcome, the Natura 2000 network, and its terrestrial vertebrate and plant species of conservation concern. They find that <mark>climate change</mark> can undermine past conservation successes when protected areas become climatically unsuitable for the species they were supposed to protect. They conclude that there is a high risk that ongoing efforts to conserve Europe’s biodiversity are jeopardised by <mark>climate change</mark>. Mitigation of <mark>climate change</mark> attenuates impacts, but the conservation of EU’s biodiversity will require policy amendments and approaches beyond those currently in place.</P><P id=""Par12"" class=""Para"">Meller et al. (<SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR28"">2014</A></SPAN>) addressed the interaction between mitigation strategies (increases in bioenergy production) and their direct and indirect impacts on biodiversity. A two-degree world with extensive use of bioenergy does have impacts for biodiversity, but the combined impacts from climatic change and land-use change in such a world are less than the impacts in a four-degree world with minor bioenergy use. Their conclusions are based on an assessment for bird species in the EU, not considering biodiversity impacts of the large share of bioenergy imported.</P><DIV id=""Par13"" class=""Para"">In terms of adaptation, an important issue for policymakers is to establish to what degree current EU biodiversity policy can already address <mark>climate change</mark>-related challenges and where are the important gaps. Van Teeffelen et al. (this issue) carried out such an assessment. First, they highlight gaps in the set of adaptation options as put forward by science, which does not address all impacts from <mark>climate change</mark> on biodiversity, but primarily focusses on shifts in species distributions (See Fig. <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Fig2"">2</A></SPAN>). Second, they assessed the degree to which the different adaptation options are accommodated by current EU biodiversity policy. They conclude that EU biodiversity policy generally supports, and even requires, adaptation in multiple ways. Substantial obstacles remain though, notably:<FIGURE class=""Figure"" id=""Fig2""><DIV class=""MediaObject"" id=""MO2""><A href=""https://media.springernature.com/original/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10113-015-0801-6/MediaObjects/10113_2015_801_Fig2_HTML.gif"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><SPAN class=""u-screenreader-only"">Open image in new window</SPAN></A></DIV><FIGCAPTION class=""Caption"" lang=""en""><DIV class=""CaptionContent""><SPAN class=""CaptionNumber"">Fig. 2</SPAN><P class=""SimplePara"">Interactions between impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on biodiversity, strategies to alleviate these impacts and EU policy instruments available today, to implement these strategies in practice (Van Teeffelen et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR37"">2011</A></SPAN>)</P></DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class=""OrderedList""><OL><LI class=""ListItem""><SPAN class=""ItemNumber"">(1)</SPAN><DIV class=""ItemContent""><P id=""Par14"" class=""Para"">There is a focus on patterns, and the Natura 2000 network is considered complete</P><P id=""Par15"" class=""Para"">While EU biodiversity legislation leaves room for proactively adapting to <mark>climate change</mark>, the currently narrow interpretation by most member states focuses on patterns rather than processes. Natura 2000 sites are designated for the occurrence of protected species and habitats. Nature is dynamic though, even more so under <mark>climate change</mark>. As the current Natura 2000 network is expected to be insufficiently robust to allow species to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark> (e.g. Araújo et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR1"">2011</A></SPAN>; Lung et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR27"">2014</A></SPAN>), extensions are necessary. This contrasts with the EU biodiversity strategy which states that the establishment of Natura 2000 should be largely complete by 2012 (European Commission <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR9"">2011</A></SPAN>, action 1A to reach Target 1) and reflects the current static interpretation of the directives.

Together with the fact that adaptation options are not specified for species, ecosystems or regional contexts, it is up to the member states, and sites managers, to identify and implement appropriate measures. This is also clear from the guidance on <mark>climate</mark> adaptation of the Natura 2000 network (European Commission <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR10"">2013</A></SPAN>), which focuses mostly on the site managers to help them make individual Natura 2000 areas more robust given <mark>climate change</mark>.

Overall, there appears to be a lack of vision (or a hesitation to put this forward), leading to a shortage of guidance on where the network as a whole needs to be strengthened through conservation or restoration measures. The subsidiarity principle creates a certain trade-off between the large-scale vision needed and the individual responsibilities of member states (see, e.g. Ioja et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR18"">2010</A></SPAN>). Even so, the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> require that measures taken locally complement one another and contribute to an adaptive, robust conservation approach at the large-scale level.</P><P id=""Par19"" class=""Para"">EU policy instruments such as LIFE(+) and the Structural and Cohesion Funds may be able to support this process. However, <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation has yet to be mainstreamed into guidelines or allocations of funding. Lung et al. (<SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR27"">2014</A></SPAN>) found that current distribution of funds through these programmes better reflects the distribution of Natura 2000 sites, than the adaptation needs facing <mark>climate change</mark>. The present changes in the LIFE programme (for the period 2014–2020) include an allocation of the share of the funds through a separate sub-programme for <mark>climate</mark> action. This has the potential to support <mark>climate change</mark> mainstreaming to various policy sectors, if projects are carefully planned and implemented. However, such a division of LIFE budgets runs a risk of disconnecting <mark>climate change</mark> considerations from projects under the conventional environment sub-programme.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec5"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1""><H2 class=""Heading"">Building <mark>climate</mark> resilience through EU regional policy</H2><DIV class=""content""><P id=""Par20"" class=""Para"">EU regional and cohesion policy accounted for total expenditures of about Euro 50B per year in 2007–2013, some 36 % of total EU budget. These expenditures hold important potential for supporting <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation goals through investments in greenhouse gas emissions reductions, as well as funding <mark>climate</mark> resilience and reducing vulnerability. Given the redistributive nature of regional policy—supporting mostly the least developed European regions—the EU could address the unequal burden of required efforts and differences in capacities in facing <mark>climate change</mark> that exist across Europe.</P><P id=""Par21"" class=""Para"">In the RESPONSES project, we investigated whether expenditures of Structural and Cohesion Funds (SCF) were consistent with the occurrence and risks of key <mark>climate</mark>-related hazards across EU regions. The <mark>climate change</mark> impact assessment was based on indicators for heat stress (in relation to human health), river flooding and forest fire at a pan-European (NUTS 2) level (Lung et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR25"">2013a</A></SPAN>). Compared with the baseline situation, for the period 2041–2070, a strong increase in overall impacts is projected for almost all regions in southern Europe and France, as well as large parts of Germany, Czech Republic, Belgium and the Netherlands. In contrast, for Ireland, Scandinavia, much of Poland and the Baltic countries and most regions of the UK, overall impacts remain comparatively low. In an accompanying study, Lung et al. (<SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR26"">2013b</A></SPAN>) show that the uncertainties in estimated impacts, with an important role for differences in projections from global and regional <mark>climate</mark> models, are highest for flood risks that are precipitation dependent, compared with heat wave and forest fire risks that are more temperature dependent.</P><DIV id=""Par22"" class=""Para"">Vulnerability hotspots were defined for heat stress, river flood risk and forest fire risk and were compared to patterns of adaptive capacities based on current human, financial and technical capital. For the future scenario for 2041–2070, there is a projected increase in the number of potentially most vulnerable regions, assuming adaptive capacity remains unchanged at current levels. New hotspot regions would be in Bulgaria, Romania, Czech Republic, Poland, and France, while other regions are projected to turn into ‘more severe’ hotspots, such as southern Romania and northern Bulgaria or (north)-eastern Germany (see Fig. <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Fig3"">3</A></SPAN>).

A systematic review of member states’ strategic planning documents shows that references to mitigation are quite common in the 2007–2013 funding period (Hanger et al., this issue). Much less attention is paid to issues related to vulnerability and adaptation (See Fig. <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Fig4"">4</A></SPAN>). The focus on mitigation is also reflected in financial allocations, owing to the earmarking provisions for items under the Lisbon Agenda (2000, Hanger et al., this issue). Overall, <mark>climate change</mark> seems to be inconsistently integrated in funding allocations. Regarding adaptation, Hungary and Malta are exceptional, with considerable allocations made for relevant investments. On the whole, however, we find that the rhetoric displayed in high-level policy documents is not reflected in actual financial allocations. Additionally, many allocations sorted under adaptation are often justified as efforts to reduce natural hazard risks after major recent events. Adaptation action appears to be more driven by events than by a strategy of integration and mainstreaming.<FIGURE class=""Figure"" id=""Fig4""><DIV class=""MediaObject"" id=""MO4""><A href=""https://media.springernature.com/original/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10113-015-0801-6/MediaObjects/10113_2015_801_Fig4_HTML.gif"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><SPAN class=""u-screenreader-only"">Open image in new window</SPAN></A></DIV><FIGCAPTION class=""Caption"" lang=""en""><DIV class=""CaptionContent""><SPAN class=""CaptionNumber"">Fig. 4</SPAN><P class=""SimplePara"">Allocations for thematic priorities relevant for mitigation and adaptation (<EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">right bars</EM>) in the EU Structural and Cohesion Funds and income levels (GDP) (<EM class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">left bars</EM>) in the EU-27 (Hanger et al. this issue)</P></DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec6"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1""><H2 class=""Heading"">Managing new <mark>climate</mark>-sensitive health threats in the EU</H2><DIV class=""content""><P id=""Par24"" class=""Para"">The role of the EU in improving public health is to complement national actions, especially where national authorities need to cooperate. Management of new disease threats requires international cooperation, with other agencies, such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), already playing a prominent role of health protection and promotion. Many vector-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, are not currently autochthonous in Europe but may become so under <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P id=""Par25"" class=""Para"">Adverse health impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> may follow extreme weather events, especially drought, flooding and heat waves, or could be associated with gradual changes in the ecology of natural environments or biota. Based on a literature review, Bouzid and Hunter (<SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR5"">2012</A></SPAN>) identified a list of high-priority diseases likely to pose a threat in Europe under a changing <mark>climate</mark>. For vector-borne diseases, these include West Nile fever, dengue fever, chikungunya fever, malaria, leishmaniasis, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), lyme borreliosis, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), spotted fever rickettsioses, yellow fever and Rift Valley fever. Waterborne diseases are also likely to be influenced by <mark>climate change</mark>. The risk to human health is associated with the contamination of drinking and recreational waters with waterborne bacteria, parasites and viruses. Another major health impact is associated with heat stress-related morbidity and mortality, which is considered an area of major direct impact because of the severity of the outcome (death) and increased political sensitivity. However, cold-related deaths currently outweigh heat-related deaths in the UK by at least an order of magnitude (Vardoulakis et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR38"">2014</A></SPAN>). Cold-related deaths are projected to decrease more markedly than heat-related deaths will increase this century, and both will be amplified by an ageing population. In summary, <mark>climate change</mark> is likely to allow expansion of the geographical distribution of vector-borne diseases or even emergence of new ones, increase prevalence of waterborne diseases and result in more extreme weather events, thus contributing to an increased disease burden.</P><P id=""Par26"" class=""Para"">An appraisal was conducted of the effectiveness of public health interventions directed at the <mark>climate</mark>-sensitive diseases through a systematic review of systematic reviews (Bouzid et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR6"">2013</A></SPAN>). No reviews were found for nine of 17 of the high-priority <mark>climate</mark>-sensitive diseases. Chemoprophylaxis (medication preventing disease) and immunization interventions were generally backed by good-quality evidence and showed high effectiveness. We consider that environmental and/or community-based interventions—such as removing mosquito-breeding sites or checking on vulnerable groups during heat waves—could have the most value in a warmer world, despite a lack of good-quality evidence to date. These interventions should be prioritised as <mark>climate</mark> adaptation options, while being sensitive to potential conflicts with objectives in other policy fields, such as the biodiversity impacts of draining wetlands.</P><P id=""Par27"" class=""Para"">Adaptation options depend on health services, including appropriate infrastructure and an efficient healthcare system. In addition, to ensure adequate responses to the health challenges caused by <mark>climate change</mark>, it is crucial that healthcare professionals receive appropriate and focused training. Other adaptation options include early detection, and disease management and prevention. The implementation of entomological and sentinel clinical surveillance networks (early detection of the mosquito vector and index of human cases) has proven to be valuable in identifying disease hotspots and in limiting disease spread when appropriate health responses (case isolation and treatment) are promptly implemented. For extreme weather events, appropriate infrastructure, accurate forecast and timely alerts for at-risk populations are likely to be the best adaptation and preparedness options. An example of this is heat–health warning systems (HHWS) currently implemented in several European countries.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec7"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1""><H2 class=""Heading"">Transforming electricity production in the EU</H2><DIV class=""content""><P id=""Par28"" class=""Para"">The electricity sector is fundamental to CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions reductions in the EU. But it also needs to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark> and variability. The need for <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation in the electricity sector was investigated through a literature-based vulnerability analysis identifying the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on electricity supply and demand in the EU (Held et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR15"">2010</A></SPAN>). The impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on the demand and supply side differ by European region (and over time), but are—in the main—limited in scope. Major findings on electricity supply are that hydropower, thermal and nuclear power technologies are most vulnerable. Hydropower, which depends on river flow regimes, is threatened by changed precipitation patterns. For thermal and nuclear plants, reduced availability of cooling water (from rivers) can increase the number of shutdowns and the costs for alternative cooling systems. In contrast, wind and solar power are less vulnerable. Especially in Southern Europe, electricity demand for cooling purposes is affected by <mark>climate change</mark>. Heat demand in winter is reduced for Europe as a whole, compensating for increased cooling needs (Labriet et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR20"">2013</A></SPAN>).</P><P id=""Par29"" class=""Para"">The electricity sector is critical to achieve deep emissions reductions in Europe. Under a new low-emission scenario for the EU (Deetman et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR8"">2013</A></SPAN>), which looked at specific policy measures across different sectors (that is, not assuming cost-optimal solutions with a <mark>carbon</mark> tax alone), a reduction of 34–43 % in total EU emissions by 2050 could be achieved in the power generation sector alone, with wind generation playing a major role. As this already implies a complete de<mark>carbon</mark>isation of the electricity sector, reduction measures in other sectors are also important to achieve the long-term EU <mark>climate</mark> targets. A high share of renewable energies is cost efficient in all scenarios analysed (Deetman et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR7"">2015</A></SPAN>). Realising this requires an extensive expansion of electricity grids. Few new large-scale electricity storage facilities will be needed. However, if the growth in electricity demand cannot be slowed down through effective energy efficiency measures, at least one additional low-<mark>carbon</mark> technology like <mark>Carbon</mark> capture and storage (CCS) or nuclear is necessary. If all the obstacles to CCS can be removed, it will become an important pillar of the de<mark>carbon</mark>isation strategy. In this case, CCS in combination with coal-based power will displace nuclear power almost completely. Without CCS, a more rapid growth in renewables would be required, and nuclear energy could become competitive again. Nevertheless, path dependencies require speedy decisions on the future technological mix regarding renewables, nuclear energy and CCS.</P><P id=""Par30"" class=""Para"">Reichardt et al. (<SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR33"">2011</A></SPAN>) investigated policy support for a number of more novel technologies with significant mitigation potential: concentrated solar power (CSP), offshore wind, marine energy production (tidal and wave power) and CCS. The main findings suggest that although feed-in tariffs and renewable obligation certificates are major drivers in all <mark>innovation</mark> phases of the three renewable technologies, they are currently not sufficient for these technologies to develop successfully. Rather, further policy elements need to be in place, such as research, development and deployment funding, which can be tailored towards specific technologies. This kind of support is not consistently available in the EU, suggesting that the development of these technologies will be slow.</P><P id=""Par31"" class=""Para"">In summary, we find that EU energy and <mark>climate policy</mark> have consistently matched ambitious <mark>climate</mark> targets with a range of instruments designed to achieve greenhouse emissions reductions among large emitters in the electric power sector and, to a lesser extent, manufacturing industry. In the period after 2000, there was major policy <mark>innovation</mark>, including the introduction of the EU-wide Emissions Trading System (ETS). Evidence suggests that the ETS has reduced EU greenhouse gas emissions by 40–80 MT per year since it was introduced in 2005 (Laing et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR22"">2014</A></SPAN>), against total energy sector emissions reductions for the EU-25 of 448 MT over the same period (EEA <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR13"">2014</A></SPAN>). Nor is there evidence that the ETS has served to stimulate <mark>innovation</mark> and investment in renewables and CCS—the two critical components of a low-<mark>carbon</mark> EU energy economy (Rogge et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR34"">2010</A></SPAN>). Rather, EU policy has served as the politico-legal framework within which quite unique national energy transitions have been set in motion.</P><P id=""Par32"" class=""Para"">Key decisions in the area of <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation are obviously taken outside Europe. The role of the USA, India and China is large, when it comes to actual potentials for global emissions reductions and possibilities to achieve the two-degree target set by the international community. The RESPONSES project explicitly included the assessment of mitigation scenarios from these key countries. Hof et al. (<SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR17"">2015</A></SPAN>) analyse scenarios from India and China and find that compared with international studies, current emissions from these countries tend to be underestimated, but also that de<mark>carbon</mark>isation may pick up more rapidly according to national assessments. Similar uncertainties affect future emissions projects for the USA (Wilbanks and Wright <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR39"">2012</A></SPAN>). Patchy mitigation effort at the state level is complemented by a host of policies at the Federal level (White House <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR35"">2013</A></SPAN>) on regulating the power sector, renewables and transport, with the greatest opportunities in the power sector. Most US analysts currently believe a US emissions trajectory consistent with a global two-degree target is unlikely to be achieved.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec8"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1 SectionTypeConclusion""><H2 class=""Heading"">Conclusions</H2><DIV class=""content""><P id=""Par33"" class=""Para"">Our review of <mark>climate</mark> mainstreaming into European sectoral policies demonstrates that synergies can be achieved between greenhouse gas emissions reductions (mitigation) and increasing <mark>climate</mark> resilience (adaptation) in some areas of EU policy, such as land-use management in agriculture and more efficient use of water resources. But for most EU policies, mitigation and adaptation are likely to remain separate endeavours. There are relatively few clear contact points for mitigation and adaptation, while the capacity to achieve fully integrated appraisals and actions remains limited. Cross-compliance has become an increasingly important dimension of EU policy, especially in agriculture, but the differing political goals manifest across policy fields, in combination with technical complexity, means that achieving ‘win–wins’ remains difficult. <mark>Climate</mark> mainstreaming is an argument for strengthening policy integration, but in practice takes place within the framings and procedures of existing policy fields.</P><P id=""Par34"" class=""Para"">If mainstreaming of mitigation and adaptation remains largely separate, we also find that there is an imbalance in the policy effort across these two broad objectives. <mark>Climate change</mark> objectives have been a central feature of EU energy policy for over a decade, complementing market liberalisation and energy security. Successive generations of EU emissions reduction policies have been put forward, including both declared objectives (normative mainstreaming) and concrete measures aimed at achieving these targets. The latest 2030 framework for <mark>climate</mark> and energy policy (EC <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR11"">2014</A></SPAN>) envisages a 40 % reduction in domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 1990, and sets new targets for renewable energy and energy savings. These are high-level commitments, demanding considerable political coordination within the European Union and of great importance for the standing of Europe internationally. They represent serious and binding commitments by member states, to each other and in the international arena. For some European states, like Germany, they represent a deeper vision about technological and economic leadership and the key to strategic European concerns about energy security.</P><P id=""Par35"" class=""Para"">This is much less the case for <mark>climate</mark> mainstreaming with respect to the goal of reducing vulnerability to <mark>climate change</mark> impacts and stimulating adaptation. Here, the politics are primarily domestic to EU member states, while the question of the proper role of European policy remains contested. There is no high-level narrative at the European level about adaptation to <mark>climate change</mark>, nor is there a strong argument for coordination. EU member states have pursued divergent <mark>climate</mark> adaptation policies at the national level as well (Biesbroek et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR3"">2010</A></SPAN>). Perhaps the strongest opportunity for coordination is through the expenditures of regional policy, which have a large impact in the least developed areas of the EU and may potentially contribute to support more <mark>climate</mark>-resilient infrastructure and economic development. At a time when growth and jobs are at the centre of European political concerns and when the role of European institutions is being widely questioned, <mark>climate</mark> mainstreaming will remain an issue that is dealt with in the ‘undergrowth’ of policy action. And this political reality has been strengthened by the broad perception that adaptation is a context-specific problem, best dealt with at the local scale.</P><P id=""Par36"" class=""Para"">As a result, the adaptation policy response has been mainly technocratic, through incremental adjustments to existing policies and measures, primarily achieved through changed routines of policy guidance and appraisal. The 2013 EU Strategy on Adaptation to <mark>Climate Change</mark> (EC <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR10"">2013</A></SPAN>) emphasises the role of member state action, guidance and information, mainstreaming <mark>climate</mark> into sectoral policies and technical assistance in the EU’s international assistance. The most substantial commitment relates to mainstreaming, in the shape of an objective that up to 20 % of the EU’s Euro 960 Billion budget for the period 2014 and 2020 (the Multiannual Financial Framework, MFF) will be on ‘…<mark>climate</mark>-related expenditure’. This relates especially to the five European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds), which account for about one-third of MFF expenditures and to investments made by the European Investment Bank and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).</P><P id=""Par37"" class=""Para"">A key governance dilemma for <mark>climate</mark> adaptation mainstreaming exists between the need for central direction and the benefits of local discretion. The European Commission can play an important role in providing guidance, information and supporting capacities on the ground. But, given the spatial and social variability of <mark>climate</mark> vulnerabilities, as well as uncertainties about where and how quickly <mark>climate</mark> risks will emerge, local-level discretion in adaptation will continue to be important. Especially for long-term investments, there will be growing benefits in opting for robust solutions that are resilient under different scenarios.</P><P id=""Par38"" class=""Para"">An analysis of structural fund allocations in previous periods (Hanger et al., this issue) found that there are major opportunities to align investment in long-term infrastructures and to build adaptive capacity to achieve greater <mark>climate</mark> resilience in many regions, especially in southern and central Europe. But there is a clear danger that this remains a ‘re-labelling’ exercise. Schemes that would have been funded under previous policy regimes may go forward, even if marginally adjusted. On the positive side, <mark>climate</mark> protection and <mark>climate</mark> resilience may be used as new ways of justifying investments. On the negative side, new guidance and appraisal methodologies will be seen as another hurdle to be overcome by administrators of policy at national and local levels. They will take the full measure of discretion they have been given—and which analysts have suggested is necessary—to make their own judgements. It is unclear that <mark>climate</mark> resilience will always be the winner. Looking to the past, we see this in the national, regional and local implementation of EU policies in biodiversity, water and structural and cohesion funding.</P><P id=""Par39"" class=""Para"">Where then might mainstreaming of <mark>climate</mark> adaptation succeed? The literature suggests that mainstreaming <mark>climate</mark> adaptation into EU policy is more likely where there is a shared concern about <mark>climate</mark> risks, high-level political commitment about the need to respond to these risks, ‘hard’ instruments (like mandates) and ‘win–win’ opportunities for linking <mark>climate</mark> and other policy goals. While many of these conditions exist in the interstices of EU policy, decision-making and implementation, the seriousness with which mainstreaming is pursued remains highly variable. Certainly, the current incremental and technocratic approach to adaptation in the EU makes the achievement of radical steps towards greater <mark>climate</mark> resilience less likely. Perhaps, the radical steps which have been achieved in mitigating <mark>carbon</mark> emissions in the EU will mean that the incremental and devolved strategy for adaptation is enough. But there is also a good chance that despite the best European efforts at growing a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy, there will be a need for more radical measures to achieve <mark>climate</mark> resilience across key domains of European competence, like agriculture, biodiversity and infrastructures. Such an agenda of transformative <mark>climate</mark> adaptation might require the reconsideration of central assumptions in many EU policy domains. This prospect has not yet been addressed by European policymakers.</P></DIV></SECTION></DIV><SECTION id=""Notes"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1""><H2 class=""Heading"">Notes</H2><DIV class=""content""><SECTION><H3 class=""Heading"">Acknowledgments</H3><P class=""SimplePara"">The research in the RESPONSES project has been funded by the Research Directorate-General of the European Commission through its Seventh Framework Programme (Grant Agreement Number 244092).

This important insight is illustrated in this article with the example of agriculture and its causal connections with <mark>climate change</mark>.</H2><P>The links between industrial agriculture and <mark>climate change</mark> are twofold. On the one hand, the crops grown in the genetically homogeneous monocultures that are typical of chemical farming are vulnerable to the <mark>climate</mark> extremes that are becoming more frequent and more violent as a result of global warming. On the other hand, industrial agriculture contributes significantly to the greenhouse gases causing <mark>climate change</mark> because it is energy intensive and fossil-fuel dependent.</P><FIGURE id=""attachment_68012"" style=""width: 350px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Photo: Women Who Farm Instagram Feed</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>From a systemic point of view, it is evident that a food system that is highly centralized, energy-intensive and dependent on petrochemicals and fossil fuels; a system, moreover, that creates health hazards for farmers, agricultural workers and consumers and is unable to cope with increasing <mark>climate</mark> disasters, cannot be sustained in the long run.</P><FIGURE id=""attachment_68007"" style=""width: 350px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Fritjof Capra. Photo: © Basso Cannarsa</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Fortunately, there is a viable and <mark>sustainable</mark> alternative to industrial agriculture. It consists of a variety of agricultural techniques, based on ecological principles that have been refined over the past century and are being adopted around the world, especially in the past two decades. With these techniques, healthy biodiverse foods are grown in decentralized, community-oriented, energy-efficient, and <mark>sustainable</mark> ways. These ecologically-oriented farming techniques include organic-certified farming, permaculture, and biodynamic farming. In recent years, the term “agroecology” has increasingly been used as a unifying term, referring to both the scientific basis and the practice of an agriculture based on ecological principles.</P><P>Agroecology is <mark>sustainable</mark> because it dramatically reduces the need for off-farm inputs, is dependent on the saving and sharing of seeds versus purchased seeds, and can be fostered through farmer-to-farmer education not through expensive inputs. Of critical importance for the future of agriculture is the observation that resilience to extreme <mark>climate</mark> events is closely linked to agricultural biodiversity, which is a key characteristic of agroecology. Agroecological practices are labor-intensive and community-oriented, thereby reducing poverty and social exclusion. In these ways, agroecology is able to raise agricultural productivity in ways that are economically viable, environmentally benign and socially uplifting.</P><P>When soil is farmed organically, moreover, its <mark>carbon</mark> content increases, and by sequestering <mark>carbon</mark> in this way organic farming can contribute to reducing the concentration of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere. In other words, agroecology not only is more resistant to global warming than industrial agriculture; it also helps stabilize the <mark>climate</mark>, whereas industrial agriculture aggravates <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>In recent years, agroecology has taken off around the world. The rapid growth of the peasant-led international movement <A href=""https://viacampesina.org/en/"">La Via Campesina</A> and of the <A href=""https://www.ifoam.bio/"">International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements</A> speak to the interest in scaling up this approach to agriculture. Organizations like <A href=""https://www.socla.co/en/"">SOCLA</A> in Latin America and the Campesino a Campesino (farmer-to-farmer) network in Central America have reached thousands of farmers across the region. All together, these groups have helped to train hundreds of thousands of farmers in agroecological approaches, proving that the shift from industrial agriculture to agroecological practices is not only urgently needed, but is also practical and can be achieved without new technologies or expensive investments. What we need now to scale up agroecology from successful local and regional projects to the global level is political will and visionary global leadership.</P><P><EM>This article is an abstract of a longer piece, “<A href=""http://www.abocashop.com/en/agricoltura-e-cambiamento-climatico-2"">Agricolutura e Cambiamento Climatico</A>” (Agriculture and <mark>Climate Change</mark>) published in Italian by <A href=""http://www.abocamuseum.it/en/"">Aboca</A>.</EM></P><P><EM><A href=""http://www.fritjofcapra.net/"">Fritjof Capra</A>, Ph.D., is a scientist, educator, activist, and author of many international bestsellers that connect conceptual changes in science with broader changes in worldview and values in society.</EM></P><P><EM><A href=""https://annalappe.com/"">Anna Lappé</A> is a national bestselling author, a respected advocate for sustainability and justice along the food chain and an advisor to funders investing in food system transformation.

The deal will likely face close regulatory scrutiny. (Reuters)</SPAN></DIV></DIV><P>“They’re just so narrowly focused,” Mooney said, “that there’s a general feeling they can’t get us to the <mark>innovation</mark>s we need.”</P><P>The deal is likely to draw intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators, who will assess whether the merger would unfairly lead to higher prices and fewer choices for farmers’ most important building blocks. The new company would preside over roughly one-quarter of the world’s seed and pesticide supplies.</P><P>Justice Department investigators have in recent years launched investigations into “possible anticompetitive practices” in the Monsanto-led U.S. seed industry, although a formal investigation was closed in 2012 without pursuing charges.</P><P>Regulatory crackdowns have dashed several high-profile mega-mergers this year, including a <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/pfizer-allergan-call-off-160-billion-merger-after-us-moves-to-block-inversions/2016/04/06/4fd55446-fc11-11e5-80e4-c381214de1a3_story.html"" shape=""rect"" title=""www.washingtonpost.com"">$160 billion deal between pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and Allergan</A>.</P><P>The Bayer deal — the largest corporate mega-merger in a year full of them — is also likely to meet congressional resistance. Calling the merger “a threat to all Americans,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Wednesday urged regulators to block the deal and reopen an investigation into Monsanto’s massive influence over the seed and chemical markets.</P><P>“These mergers boost the profits of huge corporations and leave Americans paying even higher prices,” Sanders said in a statement.</P><P>Genetically modified seeds dominate U.S. farming and are used in the growing of more than 90 percent of corn, cotton and soybean crops. But their use remains a major driver of environmental protests in Europe and has led to political action at home. In July, President Obama signed into law a bill requiring food companies to label products that include genetically modified organisms, or GMOs.</P><P>With its rapid development and fierce protection of genetically engineered seeds and pesticides, Monsanto has been made into an arch-villain for some environmental and consumer activists, who worry that the chemical underpinnings of “Frankenseeds” threaten human health and allow laboratories to play God.</P><P>The advanced seeds have also provided for a range of benefits, including stronger pest resistance, streamlined weed control and more efficient harvests around the world.</P><P>Years of research have revealed no proof that genetically engineered crops pose risks to human health. A National Academies of Sciences expert panel concluded in May that there was “no substantiated evidence” that the crops had endangered our bodies or hurt the globe.</P><P>“Asking whether GMOs are safe is like asking whether toys are safe,” said Rick Amasino, a University of Wisconsin professor of biochemistry who participated in the report. “Most people would recognize that as too broad a question. You can’t lump all chemicals into one bin.”</P><P>“Farmers don’t have to use these things. They have a choice,” Amasino added. “Industry is giving farmers something that, I suspect, farmers want.”</P><P>Dana Perls, a senior campaigner on food and technology with Friends of the Earth, said agricultural juggernauts such as Monsanto have crafted institutional blocks that prevent small farmers from freely choosing how to grow their crops.</P><P>“This further consolidation over our food system removes even more power from people to control their agriculture, and to choose what we can and can’t consume,” Perls said. The deal, she added, would “make it even more difficult to make sure that what comes onto the market is safe for people and the environment.”</P><P>The deal would be the largest German takeover yet of an American firm. Known in the United States largely for its health-care products, Bayer would emerge from the deal further focused on its business in agriculture chemicals, crop supplies, and compounds that kill bugs and weeds.</P><P>Bayer first made a $62 billion offer for Monsanto in May and has increased its bid over months of negotiations. The all-cash deal is valued at about $128 a share and is larger than the previous record, the $60 billion merger between brewers Anheuser-Busch and InBev in 2008.</P><P>Sales in 2015 at Bayer, which has 117,000 employees, totaled roughly $51 billion, about 30 percent of which came from its crop division. Sales at Monsanto, which employs 20,000 and also develops such products as the weed-killing herbicide Roundup, totaled $15 billion last year.</P><P>The companies portrayed the merger as a landmark agreement that would help them invest more in researching and developing chemicals for the global harvesting of vegetables, corn and other crops. The deal, they added, would also help them save $1.5 billion through cost-cutting, added purchasing power and other “synergies” within three years.</P><P>“The whole agricultural industry around the world is basically going through a transformation. It’s the last big industry in the world to be digitized,” said Robb Fraley, Monsanto’s chief technology officer. “This allows us to make more investments, have more capabilities and build better products for farmers, that they can use to grow crops with higher yields . . . and farm better, farm smarter.”</P><P>Both companies said that they would seek antitrust approval in 30 global jurisdictions, possibly including emerging markets for seeds and pesticides such as China, India and Brazil. Bayer has committed to paying a $2 billion antitrust breakup fee if the deal falls apart.</P><P>Asked whether they were worried about regulatory challenges from a new U.S. administration, Monsanto chief executive Hugh Grant said on a call Wednesday that the companies were “much more focused on the <mark>innovation</mark> horizon than the political horizon.”</P><P>David Balto, a former Federal Trade Commission policy director who works with farmers and consumer groups, said there was a strong chance that the Justice Department regulators would crack down on the deal.</P><P>“Antitrust cops are learning they’re cops,” Balto said. The companies “have chosen to do a deal in the year of merging dangerously. They are in for a tough time.”</P><P>A growing Bayer-Monsanto giant could also block out smaller competitors, said Matthew Crisp, the chief executive of Benson Hill Biosystems, an agricultural technology firm.</P><P>“Large companies’ model of <mark>innovation</mark> . . . has served as a barrier to entry for smaller companies interested in developing more choice for farmers,” Crisp said.</P><P>Monsanto’s St. Louis headquarters will become the companies’ commercial headquarters for North America, but it’s unclear how the mega-deal might affect jobs there.

Sixty two percent have either experienced negative impacts of <A href=""https://www.environmentalleader.com/category/<mark>climate</mark>""><mark>climate</mark></A> change or expect to within 10 years. Their top concerns include damage to facilities, loss of water or power supplies, higher costs and disruption of supply and distribution chains.</P><P>But C2ES says that despite firms’ awareness, because they don’t have the knowledge or tools to relate these concerns and risks back to their operations, most resilience measures do not go beyond “business as usual.” Most companies are managing these risks through existing business continuity and emergency management plans and only a few have used <mark>climate</mark>-specific tools to comprehensively assess risks.</P><P>The report also include case studies of American Water, Bayer, The Hartford Group, National Grid, Rio Tinto and Weyerhaeuser, highlighting what companies can do to prepare for <mark>climate change</mark> and extreme weather.</P><P>To help Bayer analyze the potential future risks from <mark>climate change</mark> impacts, its environmental and sustainability group worked with financial experts to build a <mark>climate change</mark> “risk matrix” to evaluate and prioritize <mark>climate</mark>-related risks over Bayer’s 10- to 20-year planning horizon, the report says. The matrix ranks risks according to their potential extent of damage and frequency of occurrence, and assigns a simple high, medium or low impact rating.</P><P>For example, when the potential supply chain risks related to shipping were assessed, lower water levels on the Rhine River due to more intense droughts were assigned a rating of “low risk,” given the availability of alternate transport via rail and truck.</P><P>Another case study examines American Water, the largest publicly traded water utility in the US. American Water anticipates greater uncertainty and risk under changing climatic conditions. So it’s adopting a more integrated management approach to water resources that will expand available water supply options through more water conservation and re-use — something it did only on an occasional basis in the past.</P><P>The C2ES report recommends creating a clearinghouse for reliable, up-to-date data and analytical tools. It says companies need user-friendly, localized projections of <mark>climate change</mark>s and models that link these projections to impacts that are relevant to company operations. It advices investing in public infrastructure resilience, since companies rely on public resources, including roads, bridges and ports, to get their goods and services to market and need these resources to withstand extreme weather and <mark>climate</mark> impacts.</P><P>The report also suggests considering resilience needs in regulated sectors, such as water, electricity and insurance, where regulators need to be forward-looking and open to companies making the case for more spending on resilience. Setting up voluntary, public-private partnerships that bring together government and business expertise will improve resilience planning, it concludes.</P><P>Other organizations have also sounded the warning bell about the impacts of extreme weather on business. In June, a report from the United Nations Environment Programme said <A href=""https://www.environmentalleader.com/2013/06/21/<mark>climate</mark>-change-will-increasingly-affect-businesses/"">extreme weather events, water scarcity, biodiversity loss and other global warming-related changes</A> in the environment will increasingly affect businesses and how they operate.  The report said private sector’s operating costs, markets for products and availability of raw materials will be affected by <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>A Worldwatch Institute report that came out in May says the <A href=""https://www.environmentalleader.com/2013/05/30/us-weather-extremes-account-for-two-thirds-of-global-losses/"">US was seriously affected by weather extremes last year</A>, accounting for 69 percent of overall losses and 92 percent of insured losses due to natural catastrophes worldwide.  Hurricane Sandy, the summer-long drought in the Midwest and severe storms with tornadoes accounted for $100 billion of those global overall losses, the report says.</P><P>The insurance industry covered $58 billion of the losses. These losses were the second highest overall and insured losses since 1980 in the US.</P><P><EM>Image Credit: C2ES</EM></P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV class=""homepage-whitepaper-block""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col col-sm-6""><DIV class=""white_paper_title""><STRONG>OSHA Written HazCom Plan Template</STRONG></DIV><DIV class=""white_paper_sponsor""><SPAN class=""white_paper_sponsor_by"">Sponsored By: VelocityEHS</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""col col-sm-6""><DIV class=""white_paper_title""><STRONG>Is Energy-From-Waste Worse Than Coal?</STRONG></DIV><DIV class=""white_paper_sponsor""><SPAN class=""white_paper_sponsor_by"">Sponsored By: Covanta Environmental Solutions</SPAN>  </DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col col-sm-6""><DIV class=""white_paper_sponsor""><SPAN class=""white_paper_sponsor_by"">Sponsored By: UL EHS Sustainability</SPAN>  </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Bob is a fourth-generation farmer who received his undergraduate and Masters degrees from University of Vermont in Agricultural Engineering and Agriculture Economics. The Fosters were one of the pioneers of &quot;Cow Power&quot; with Bob actually coining the term. A proponent of bioenergy, the Fosters were among the earliest to install an anaerobic digester on their farm. The digester consists of a huge tank and supporting equipment where cow manure is treated and the methane gas that's released is captured and converted to run generators, creating electrical energy. The Foster Brothers Farm has been largely electrical energy independent ever since.</P><P>The Fosters have developed one of the largest compost companies in New England. They gather residual nutrients from their own and neighbors' farms, process manure for use as fertilizer, blend the different formulas together, and distribute the resulting product (through their company, Vermont Natural Ag Products, as MOO™ Doo) throughout New England as fertilizer and soil amendments. Bob Foster served on the Cabot Cheese Board of Directors for 37 consecutive years.</P><P><STRONG style=""color: #000000;"">Earl Garber</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Earl Garber,</STRONG> former President of the National Association of Conservation Districts, is a licensed crop sconsultant and rice, soybean and hay producer from Louisiana.

Was it a reckless move or a bold bet on digital farming?</P></DIV></HEADER><DIV class=""submission__content entry-content""><P><STRONG>Digital Farming</STRONG></P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> will make it difficult for farmers to continue to supply enough food for the world’s growing population. While the world will add three billion people by 2050, arable land per capita is expected to decline by around 17%. An increase in food production of 60% is required to feed the planet, but less land and consumer resistance to genetically modified yield enhancing seed varieties means innovative solutions are needed to close the gap between this requirement and current production levels.</P><P>The marriage of digital analytics with one of the world’s oldest industries is the solution that has gained the most traction. Today each farmer goes through more than 40 major planting decisions each season. Digital analytics can be used to capture and analyze data and make recommendations specific to farmers along the entire planting cycle so that these decisions can be optimized to deliver more yield while also improving sustainability. [1]</P><P><STRONG>Monsanto’s Digital Efforts </STRONG></P><P>Monsanto, the biotech seed giant, made its leap into digital farming in November 2013 with the $1bn acquisition of <mark>Climate</mark> Corporation, a San Francisco based startup (founded by former Google employees) which was using agronomics, climatology and the power of “big data” to improve farmer decision making. [2] As the world’s largest hybrid-seed producer, Monsanto has a library of hundreds of seeds and terabytes of data on their yields. “By adding these to the <mark>Climate</mark> Corporation’s soil and weather database, it produced a map of America which says which seed grows best in which field, under what conditions.” [3]</P><P>Through a series of acquisitions, Monsanto expanded the capabilities of its core digital product, <EM>FieldView Drive</EM>, which allows a farmer to connect his/her tractor to a device that can transmit field data to an IPad and use that information to understand seed performance by field, soil zone and see a side by side view of planted areas and yield data. [4] With small players entering the ag-tech space, Monsanto transformed FieldView into a centralized platform for transmitting data from various sources of equipment and sensor technologies, giving farmers a central spot to access the latest technologies. [5] Monsanto believes the benefits of <mark>Climate</mark> Corp’s user base and technologies, avoiding the need to develop their own systems for creating farmer accounts, securely transmitting data and payments, are enticing enough to attract third-parties to its platform. [4]</P><P>As of August 2016, FieldView was being used on 100 million U.S. acres, with 15 million using its premium services. Monsanto expects the product to reach 400 million acres by 2025 and to be profitable by 2020. [6]. For farmers, the results have been very positive. “[Those] who have tried Monsanto’s system say it has pushed up yields by roughly 5% over a two-year period, a feat no other single intervention could match.” [3]</P><P><STRONG>Transforming its Organization</STRONG></P><P>With a mission to unlock “digital yield” through predictive analytics and Internet of Things (IoT) technology, Monsanto is also rethinking the role of information technology in its organization. Traditionally serving as a “back office” business support function, Monsanto’s IT department is now being challenged to be a “shaper of demand” and help drive forward-thinking business strategies. “Monsanto, at the end of the day, is a yield based company. We are trying to increase the yield, reduce input costs, increase output, and drive that more sustainably. If we are a yield based company, think about the power of unlocking digital and digital yield for our company, in all that we do…IT delivers the digital platforms that [unlocks that],” said James Swanson, Monsanto’s CIO. [7]</P><P><STRONG>The Merger and Future</STRONG></P><P>While Bayer’s management deflected a question during the M&amp;A conference call on how much value was ascribed to Monsanto’s digital agriculture platform, Werner Baumann, Bayer’s CEO, did reveal, “the way new technologies can change business models, and with the significant investment and Monsanto really being at the forefront of this development, this is going to be highly valuable.”</P><P>Bayer’s longer term vision is an outcome driven value proposition. “We are not simply selling farmers seeds, traits, and crop protection products, but optimized field level prescriptions to improve on-site decision making and execution. In the future, we should be able to offer outcomes-based solutions, for example a disease or a weed-free acre, or maybe even a yield guarantee, to give some examples,” said Liam Condon, Head of Crop Science Division.

Its vessels are equipped with massive cranes, allowing it to load and unload massive objects, like multi-ton propeller blades for wind turbines. It is an enormously expensive business, but last summer, Beluga executives hit upon an interesting way to save money: <A href=""http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2009/09/12/two_german_merchant_ships_conquer_famed_arctic_passage/"" target=""_blank"">Shipping freight over a melting Arctic</A>.</P><P class=""paywall"">Beluga had received contracts to send materials on a sprawling trip that would begin in Ulsan, South Korea, head north and west to the Russian port city of Archangelsk – located near the border with Finland – and wind up in Nigeria. Normally, this route requires Beluga's ships to navigate a 11,000-mile route through the Suez Canal. But in 2008, executives for Beluga Shipping decided that global warming had eroded the Arctic's summer sea ice significantly enough that their ships could travel the [Northeast Passage](file://localhost/C/%5CUsers%5CTal%5CDesktop%5C2009-10-17-Heavy-Lift-PFI-Beluga-Ships.pdf) (pdf) along the north coast of Russia. Previously, a cargo ship could only safely navigate that route if an icebreaker went ahead, smashing a route through thick ice.</P><P class=""paywall"">Now, a warming <mark>climate</mark> had – for six to eight weeks beginning in July – transformed much of the route into mostly open water, studded with ice floes that the Beluga ships could navigate. So its executives got permission from the Russian government to travel along the coast, paid a transit fee of &quot;a comparably moderate five-digit figure,&quot; and sent the ships on their way. Four months later, they'd finished the trip. Compared to the old Suez Canal journey, this shorter route saved an enormous pile of money: It cost $300,000 less per ship in lower fuel and bunker costs. Global warming had boosted the company's revenues by more than half a million dollars in one year alone.</P><P class=""paywall"">When I interviewed Beluga CEO Niels Stolberg via email this spring, he said he envisions using the Northeast Passage regularly. Indeed, he's planning on another trip this summer. He said that since the shorter passage requires generating far less C02, it's &quot;greener&quot;; it's also more ironic, since it was high concentrations of C02 that helped melt the route in the first place.</P><P class=""paywall"">&quot;I am convinced,&quot; Stolberg added, &quot;that the Arctic will become an area of quite regular sea traffic at least during summer.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">If you looked merely at the realm of politics, it would be easy to believe that the question, &quot;Is <mark>climate change</mark> really happening?&quot; is still unresolved. In recent months, skeptics have attacked <mark>climate</mark> science with renewed vigor. Doubters seized on &quot;<A href=""http://motherjones.com/blue-marble/2010/04/<mark>climate</mark>gate-officially-fake-scandal"" target=""_blank""><mark>Climate</mark>gate</A>&quot; – leaked emails from bickering atmospheric scientists – to argue that the evidence in favor of warming is being cooked. Other <A href=""http://motherjones.com/mojo/2009/12/republicans-exploit-email-hack-delay-<mark>climate</mark>-action"" target=""_blank"">skeptics unearthed shoddy parts</A> of the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>'s main report, such as the fact that it cited non-peer-reviewed work by an activist group when it predicted that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035. And all along, conservative politicians have hissingly denounced global warming as a shady liberal scheme: <A href=""http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Issues.View&amp;Issue_id=0f038c02-802a-23ad-4fec-b8bc71f1a6f8"" target=""_blank"">Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma</A> has famously called it &quot;the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.&quot; These attacks appear to be working. A <A href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/126560/Americans-Global-Warming-Concerns-Continue-Drop.aspx"" target=""_blank"">spring Gallup study</A> found that Americans' concern over global warming peaked two years ago, and has steadily declined since.</P><P class=""paywall"">But there's one area where doubt hasn't grown – and where, indeed, people are more and more certain that <mark>climate change</mark> is not only real, but imminent: The world of industry and commerce.</P><P class=""paywall"">Companies, of course, exist to make money. That's often what makes them seem so rapacious. But their primal greed also plants them inevitably in the &quot;reality-based community.&quot; If a firm's bottom line is going to be affected by a changing <mark>climate</mark> – say, when its supply chains dry up because of drought, or its real estate gets swamped by sea-level rise – then it doesn't particularly matter whether or not the executives <EM>want</EM> to believe in <mark>climate change</mark>. Railing at scientists for massaging tree-ring statistics won't stop the globe from warming if the globe is actually, you know, warming. The same applies in reverse, as the folks at Beluga Shipping adroitly realized: If there are serious bucks to be made from the changing <mark>climate</mark>, then the free market is almost certainly going to jump at it.</P><P class=""paywall"">This makes capitalism a curiously bracing mechanism for cutting through ideological haze and manufactured doubt. Politicians or pundits can distort or cherry-pick <mark>climate</mark> science any way they want to try and gain temporary influence with the public. But any serious industrialist who's facing &quot;<mark>climate</mark> exposure&quot; – as it's now called by money managers – cannot afford to engage in that sort of self-delusion. Spend a couple of hours wandering through the websites of various industrial associations – aluminum manufacturers, real-estate agents, wineries, agribusinesses, take your pick – and you'll find straightforward statements about the grim reality of <mark>climate change</mark> that wouldn't seem out of place coming from Greenpeace. Last year Wall Street analysts issued 214 reports assessing the potential risks and opportunities that will come out of a warming world. One by <A href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/ccsi/pdf/corporate_valuations.pdf"" target=""_blank"">McKinsey &amp; Co</A>. argued that <mark>climate change</mark> will shake up industries with the same force that mobile phones reshaped communications.</P><P class=""paywall"">Consider, as one colorful example, the skiing industry. Beginning ten years ago, the Aspen Skiing Company began noticing that European ski lodges were being slowly destroyed by warmer weather. Europe's ski resorts tend to be located on lower mountains – about 6,000-8,000 feet high, compared to American peaks up around 11,000 feet – so they're vulnerable to even extremely tiny increases in global temperature. The 2 percent rise in the 20th century was enough &quot;to put a lot of them out of business,&quot; says Auden Schendler, executive director of sustainability for the <A href=""http://www.aspensnowmass.com/"" target=""_blank"">Aspen Skiing Company</A>, which operates two resorts spread across four mountains.</P><P class=""paywall"">But now Aspen's own season is getting shorter: &quot;More balmy Novembers, more rainy Marches,&quot; Schendler says. &quot;That's what we're seeing, and that's what the science suggests would happen. If you graph frost-free days, there are more and more in the last 30 years.&quot; <mark>Climate</mark>-change models also predict warmer nights. Aspen Skiing has noticed that happening too, and the problem here is that nighttime is when ski lodges use their water-spraying technology to make snow – &quot;and if you make it when it's warmer it's exponentially more expensive.&quot; The increasing volatility of weather overall – another prediction of <mark>climate change</mark> – poses a particular danger for ski resorts, because they operate in the red most of the year, making up their deficit during the ultra busy spring break in March. So if the weather is terrific for the entire winter but suddenly balmy during March break, that can ruin the whole fiscal year.</P><P class=""paywall"">Schendler has also learned firsthand a point that <mark>climate</mark> scientists have been making for some time: With <mark>climate change</mark>, &quot;warming&quot; isn't the only – or even the most serious – challenge. The sheer interdependence of complex ecosystems systems can grease you. For example, recent droughts in Utah <A href=""http://sbsc.wr.usgs.gov/crs/news_info/dust_storms/"" target=""_blank"">have kicked up red dust clouds that settle on Aspen's snow</A>. This makes the snow melt more quickly (because the red absorbs more heat from the sun) while also making it too gritty to ski on.</P><P class=""paywall"">Are all Aspen Skiing's recent weather problems caused by global warming? It's impossible to tell. But as Schendler notes, the last few years certainly mimic the precise effects that <mark>climate</mark> models predict, so it is at least a taste of what's to come. During a recent dust storm on Aspen's slopes, Schendler's boss wandered into his office looking morose. &quot;He said, 'Auden, if <mark>climate change</mark> is the scary thing for the future, this is the apocalypse now. What if you get this in March?''' Schendler recalls.</P><P class=""paywall"">Now, all this tricky weather hasn't exactly destroyed Aspen Skiing; the firm could probably survive even worse stuff. The top of the mountain is so high &quot;we can ski it in 50 years and it'll be great,&quot; Schendler notes. But it could certainly erode Aspen's profits, and Colorado would suffer: The ski industry overall is a <A href=""http://www.cier.umd.edu/<mark>climate</mark>adaptation/<mark>Climate</mark>%20change%E2%80%93COLORADO.pdf"" target=""_blank"">$2 billion business for the state</A>, employing fully 8 percent of the workforce.So to try and preserve its profit margins, the Aspen Skiing Company has recently <A href=""http://www.aspensnowmass.com/environment/images/ASC_House_<mark>Climate</mark>_Testimony.pdf"" target=""_blank"">become a loud voice in favor of congressional action</A> on the <mark>climate</mark>. In 2007, Schendler testified before the House Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment, calling for a cap on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions – among other things.</P><P class=""paywall"">&quot;Our attitude when we go to Congress is, look, we're a business!&quot; he adds. &quot;We didn't ask for this. We just started looking at the data and the science dispassionately and said, look, we've got a problem.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">Another industry that can't pretend <mark>climate change</mark> is a myth is insurance. Insurance firms have always carefully studied real-world data to figure out what, precisely, constitutes a risky activity. As a result, they were among the first to notice that weather was getting more violent, and more unpredictably so.</P><P class=""paywall"">&quot;It's just a logical consequence,&quot; says Peter Hoppe, head of the &quot;Geo Risks Research&quot; division of <A href=""http://www.munichre.com/en/profile/focus/<mark>climate</mark>_change/insurance_and_financial_solutions/insurance_for_renewables/default.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Munich Re</A>, the multinational reinsurance firm. &quot;Global warming affects our core business. We have seen changes already in some readings.&quot; Worldwide, Munich Re has found that &quot;great catastrophes&quot; – act-of-god weather events that cause more than a billion dollars of damage – have tripled since 1950. In 2008, even though there weren't any Katrina-level disasters, weather-related events were so severe that &quot;catastrophic losses&quot; to the world's economy were the third-highest in recorded history, <A href=""http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2008/12/31/96659.htm"" target=""_blank"">topping $200 billion globally</A> – including $40 billion in the United States. Hoppe doesn't think global warming is all to blame; some of these events are likely due to natural cycles like the 30-year &quot;North Atlantic Oscillation&quot; that is currently warming the Atlantic. But Munich Re's policy is that anthropogenic global warming is already making things worse, and that governments ought to act quickly while they still can.</P><P class=""paywall"">Granted, a warming globe isn't just downside for insurance firms. There are also profitable new business opportunities, as Hoppe points out. Munich Re is now offering coverage for renewable energy products, because wind farms and solar parks need insurance against the possibility that low wind and weak sunlight will reduce their output. &quot;It's very important for investors to dampen and level out the volatility from season to season,&quot; Hoppe says. Munich Re has also developed a product to cover solar cells that wear out before their expected 30-year lifetime.</P><P class=""paywall"">Buying insurance against bad weather isn't entirely new. Farmers have done it for years. But back in the late '90s, before Enron imploded, it created a huge new market of selling &quot;weather futures&quot; to electric utilities – hedges that would pay out if, say, a mild summer hurt their sales (because people would use less air conditioning.) After Enron pancaked, weather futures stayed around – still mostly for utilities and farms – but buying them wasn't easy: You had to personally contact one of the few weather-futures traders who'd set up their own trading desks in the wake of Enron's dissolution. But with <mark>climate</mark>-change models predicting increasingly erratic weather, a new generations of startups is heading into the field, figuring that almost any firm might want to hedge against the bad economic effects of weather – such as clothing manufacturers (who could suffer massive losses in coat sales if an unexpectedly mild winter emerges) airlines (since weather is the top cause of delays) or sporting-event promoters (when it's rainy, everyone stays away).</P><P class=""paywall""><A href=""http://www.weatherbill.com/"" target=""_blank"">Weatherbill</A> is one such startup. Founded three and a half years ago by Google expatriates, it lets anyone use their website to quickly create weather insurance for almost anything. Type in the thing you're trying to insure – say, an Iowa county fair in the third week of July – and the Weatherbill system <A href=""http://www.weatherbill.com/quote"" target=""_blank"">calculates the probability</A> of what the local weather will be like up to two years out, down to a 100-mile-wide area. It then uses that guess to instantly price a weather future or insurance contract. CEO Dave Friedberg told me Weatherbill had already sold contracts to the likes of the US Open, and that he envisions worldwide opportunities: Global agriculture suffers billions in weather-related losses each year, for example, yet many countries don't have any institutions offering easy weather insurance. That's especially true for countries likely to be the first to experience the dire consequences of <mark>climate change</mark>, such as coastal regions of Asia or Latin America.</P><P class=""paywall"">&quot;If you think about [Brazil](file://localhost/Library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html), their two biggest industries are mining and agriculture,&quot; Friedberg says. &quot;That's billions of dollars, and there's a massive market for developing crop insurance. If we can figure out agriculture and do it right, the opportunity is huge to go country by country.&quot; Does he believe that global warming is already noticeable? &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; he says. In just the three years that Weatherbill has been collecting data, extreme weather events have risen 8 percent.</P><P class=""paywall"">One of the big political questions of <mark>climate change</mark> is how far we've gone: Have we passed a tipping point of no return? Has the atmosphere already accumulated such high levels of greenhouse gases that even if we manage to cut back on emissions, we'll still wind up with a globe so much hotter that everyday life will change significantly? One emerging sector built on the assumption that we have is the &quot;<A href=""http://www.oxfamamerica.org/files/the-new-adaptation-marketplace.pdf-1"" target=""_blank"">adaptation marketplace</A>&quot; – firms offering new products and services to help companies and cities cope with changes. A 2009 study by Oxfam identified seven potentially lucrative adaptation areas, such as water management and disaster preparation; one firm in this field – the Minneapolis-based Pentair Inc., which makes pumps and filtration systems – has soared to $3.35 billion in annual revenues, partly due to contracts from the Army Corps of Engineers to provide massive pumps that will protect New Orleans against another Katrina. Another firm, North Carolina's <A href=""http://www.weatherpredict.com/"" target=""_blank"">WeatherPredict</A>, has developed a technique to [retrofit roofs with aerodynamic edges](file://localhost/viewer), reducing the damage they sustain in hurricane winds. Firms that produce genetically engineered crops are also predicting they'll reap profits from <mark>climate change</mark>: Monsanto, Bayer, BASF, and their sister firms have registered 55 worldwide patents for &quot;<mark>climate</mark> ready&quot; seeds designed to thrive in conditions of drought or other stress, according to a<A href=""http://www.etcgroup.org/en/node/687"" target=""_blank"">2008 report by ETC Group</A>, an environmental advocacy organization.</P><P class=""paywall"">Will all this <mark>climate</mark>-propelled economic activity be good for the planet? Sure, it can be satisfying to see some major CEOs agree that <mark>climate change</mark> is a real and present danger. But many environmentalists predict that the flurry of new economic activity will create its own new problems.</P><P class=""paywall"">The melting Arctic, in particular, gives many observers the willies. It's likely to see an explosion in seabed oil-and-gas exploration and tourism. (Cargo shipping, interestingly, is likely to increase at a slower rate, partly because cargo ships ferrying &quot;just in time&quot; products can't abide the delays that even small ice floes would cause – and nobody thinks the Arctic will be* entirely* ice-free for 100 years or more.) Arctic experts – and the Navy – predict a catastrophe the first time a tourist vessel or oil tanker hits an iceberg and cracks up. &quot;Tourist vessels aren't ice-hardened, and in the polar regions &quot;there's no search and rescue or salvage,&quot; standing by says Lawson Brigham, a University of Alaska professor who chaired the <A href=""http://www.pame.is/images/stories/PDF_Files/AMSA_2009_Report_2nd_print.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment</A>, a four-year study of how the commercial activity will progress in the warming north. &quot;The water's near freezing. All you need is one good Titanic.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">Other realms of <mark>climate</mark>-change commerce aren't much prettier when you look at them closely. In agriculture, the advent of <mark>climate</mark>-ready crops is clearly useful, maybe even crucial, for adaption. But it also concentrates ever more power in the hands of a small coterie of firms that own the patents to drought-resistant seeds, and the cost could cause serious hardship in the desperately poor countries of Asia or Africa, where the seeds might be most needed.</P><P class=""paywall"">And it's also true that the number of <mark>climate</mark> visionaries in industry is still quite small. Certainly, companies with skin in the game are preparing for a warmer world. But as the McKinsey report found, they're in the minority. The grand majority are deeply myopic, focused narrowly on goosing profits in the next quarter – <EM>who cares what'll happen ten years from now?</EM> In a sense, that makes them mildly agnostic force. When <mark>climate change</mark> finally does impinge on their business, they'll probably take action to adapt to it. But it also means that if they can see a short-term profit from fighting against <mark>climate</mark> science and sowing doubt, they'll do that, too. This is precisely what's still happening in the energy industry, where many firms that pay lip service to the reality of <mark>climate change</mark> also quietly funnel millions to lobbyists who fight ferociously to prevent Congress from passing laws that curtail C02 emissions.</P><P class=""paywall"">&quot;We all know big companies who are doing all this green stuff, and their lobbyists are trying to kill the <mark>carbon</mark> bill as quickly as they can,&quot; says Mindy Lubber, president of Boston-based <A href=""http://www.ceres.org/page.aspx?pid=705"" target=""_blank"">CERES</A>, an association of environment-minded investors whose members have $10 trillion under management.</P><P class=""paywall"">It may be that the corrective force comes not from inside corporations, but from investors. Many large investors, the <A href=""http://www.investmentadvisor.com/news/2010/3/Pages/<mark>Climate</mark>-Change-Proxy-Resolutions-Increase.aspx"" target=""_blank"">California State Teachers' Retirement System</A> – the nation's second largest public-pension fund – have begun demanding that firms examine and disclose any potential risks from global warming. Shareholder resolutions demanding action on <mark>climate change</mark> have nearly doubled in the last two years, rising from about 55 in 2007 to 99 in 2009, Lubber notes. In February, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidelines requiring that publicly traded firms better disclose their <mark>climate</mark>-change risk, including potential &quot;physical&quot; risks. (Read a live *Grist *forum on the new SEC regulations here .)</P><P class=""paywall"">&quot;Anyone that's building out new manufacturing facilities without working out water shortages related to <mark>climate change</mark> is getting itself into trouble,&quot; Lubber adds. &quot;Or anyone that's building on waterfront property.&quot; Another common request from shareholder resolutions is for companies to calculate the cost of their <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. Even if electric utilities and the US Chamber of Commerce are fighting against <mark>carbon</mark>-limiting legislation, investors seem to believe it is inevitable – indeed, they evidently think the government might cap <mark>carbon</mark> even in the next few years, which could dramatically increase the cost of electricity.</P><P class=""paywall"">To make corporations true partners in tackling <mark>climate change</mark>, Lubber thinks investors need to push for basic changes in the way their companies function. CEOs whose bonuses are based on bumping next-quarter results will make short-term decisions. Those who are paid based on reducing <mark>carbon</mark> usage will make long-term ones – investing in technology and processes that reduce greenhouse gases. &quot;If they're compensated for producing 86 percent more widgets, they'll do that. But if they use less fuel, they ought to be compensated for meeting their <mark>carbon</mark>-reduction goals.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">In the short run, though, there's probably only one force that will get today's blithe firms to snap to attention – and that's legislation. If Congress actually puts a price on <mark>carbon</mark>, it'll hit the world of industry with tsunamic force. At minimum, it would probably goose the price of electricity and make emissions-heavy industries instantly less profitable. (Indeed, this is one of the things the SEC and many investor groups are urging firms to do: calculate how badly they'll be shellacked if new regulations make <mark>carbon</mark> expensive.) Not everyone will be a loser. The McKinsey study calculated that alternative-energy firms will do quite well (for obvious reasons), but so will less-predictable sectors like the construction industry, as people rush to retrofit buildings with extra insulation and energy-saving rebuilds. The farsighted firms – and the ones who work on the colder fringes of the world – can see the future clearly, because they're living it. But with the stroke of a pen, Obama can bring it a lot closer. Whether it's a melting Arctic or a bold new law, the biggest forces shaping industry are, as it were, man-made.</P><P class=""paywall""><EM>This piece was produced by the <A href=""http://the<mark>climate</mark>desk.org/"" target=""_blank""><mark>Climate</mark> Desk</A> collaboration.</EM></P><P class=""paywall"">*Image: Christoph Hitz*</P><P class=""paywall"">*Clive Thompson is a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine and a columnist for Wired. *</P></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

	Bayer Vietnam, specifically the subgroup responsible for the agriculture business  Bayer CropScience, said that the company would continue working with Vietnam’s government, localities and farmers to apply <mark>climate</mark>-smart agriculture technologies to act as a driver of green growth for the fast-industrialising country, whose 70 per cent of population rely on agricultural activities for livelihood.
	At the “Second Global Conference on Agriculture, Food Security and <mark>Climate Change</mark>: Hunger for Action” in early September 2012 in Hanoi, in which Bayer acted as the sole sponsor, Bayer CropScience in Vietnam country head Torsten Velden highlighted <mark>climate change</mark>’s impacts on agriculture in Vietnam and company’s solutions to support local farmers to ensure the <mark>sustainable</mark> development of rice crops.
	According to the United Nations Development Programme’s early September-released updated <mark>climate change</mark> fact sheet for Vietnam, for the next 30 years Vietnam is ranked 23rd of 193 countries and is one of 30 “extreme risk” countries.
	Without major action such as dyke reinforcements and improved drainage, a one metre rise in means sea levels off Vietnam would threat 17,423 square kilometres or 5.3 per cent of Vietnam’s total land area. Specifically, it would threaten 39 per cent of the Mekong Delta, 10 per cent of Red River Delta, over 2.5 per cent of central coast provinces, and over 20 per cent of Ho Chi Minh City.
	While Bayer CropScience has a unique position with a portfolio combining leading crop protection solutions and high-performing hybrid rice seeds, the company has provided solutions and advice to farmers to minimise <mark>climate change</mark> impacts. With the aim to enabling farmers to increase output and quality in a <mark>sustainable</mark> way, Bayer CropScience Vietnam has worked with Cuu Long Rice Research Institute to introduce the ‘Much More Rice’ concept. This concept helps farmer to increase agricultural efficiency, productivity and income by reducing losses, improving stress tolerance, reducing input fertilisers and pesticides, increasing quality and maximising yields.
	At the conference, Bayer Vietnam also hosted a side event to exchange ideas with representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, local partners and country representatives on solutions for a <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture in Vietnam.
	Joachim Schneider, head of public affairs at Bayer CropScience AG, was the keynote speaker at the event and he shared information about <mark>Climate Change</mark> Programme of Bayer and Bayer CropScience. This programme has received a high interest from all participants. Schneider demonstrated the interconnections between <mark>climate change</mark> and agriculture, and underscored how Bayer CropScience’s complete portfolio of <mark>climate</mark>-smart solutions could help mitigate the global <mark>climate change</mark> challenge. “Vietnam is in critical need of experience, knowledge and technologies from foreign countries, organisations and donors to build its low-<mark>carbon</mark> agriculture and implement its action programme in response to <mark>climate change</mark> of agriculture and rural development for the 2011-2015 period,” said Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Cao Duc Phat.
	According to Bayer, food security would remain a critical issue for Vietnam and the international community, given that global food production must rise by at least 70 per cent in 2050 in order to feed nine billion people. It recognised that food security, poverty, <mark>climate change</mark>, and <mark>sustainable</mark> development are closely linked, and could no longer be considered separately and that agricultural policies have an important role to play with regard to these challenges.
	“As an inventor company Bayer aims at green approaches and <mark>sustainable</mark> development,” said David John Champion, general director of Bayer Vietnam.
	Bayer has operated in Vietnam for more than 17 years with two current factories located in Binh Duong and Dong Nai provinces. Since September 2009, its three subgroups office staffs which are Bayer CropScience, Bayer Healthcare and Bayer MaterialScience have moved altogether to CentrePoint office building in Ho Chi Minh City as its second branch office in Vietnam.

Nagel made four suggestions on how top business schools might address <mark>climate change</mark>:</P><OL id=""chapter02x-lz20-2""><LI><I>Educate business students about the context and drivers of energy.</I>
    From his perspective in a company that works in the energy sector, students ought to be conversant in the area of <mark>climate</mark> and energy. Issues related to energy not only impact many areas, but also provide challenges and opportunities locally.<SUP><A id=""chapter02x-ch2_ft1"" href=""#chapter02x-ch2_fn1"">1</A></SUP> Nagel stated that business school students ought to be familiar with basic energy statistics.</LI><LI><I>Ensure basic science literacy for all business students.</I>
    In his view, future business leaders need a good layperson’s understanding of science to critically follow science debates and interpret relevant data, like probability distributions, that form the basis for strategic decisions on future resource allocations. (This topic was addressed later in the workshop.)</LI><LI><I>Update operations management and finance courses to include energy issues.</I>
    He suggested the inclusion of issues related to energy in the core curriculum. Business students need to be ready to improve energy efficiency in their company’s operations. They need to understand capital investments into energy efficiency from a broad perspective and full accounting, including the risks involved. (Later in the workshop, Dan Reicher expanded on this point by explaining the need for new financial models and investment tools that are appropriate for innovative projects in the area of energy and <mark>climate</mark>.)</LI><LI><I>Provide leadership courses that foster integrated system thinking.</I>
    <mark>Climate change</mark> is a long-term issue, with global interdependencies, and local variations and priorities, Nagel asserted. It requires leaders who can “look beyond the numbers” and employ integrated systems thinking. Students need to communicate beyond the confines of their particular area of expertise to address the “bigger strategic picture, but also the risks associated with the overall uncertainty.” (See also the later discussion about communication, language, and culture.) For instance, technological advances complicate the argument on when renewables might be competitive on cost alone (Chakravarty et al., 2009).</LI></OL><P class=""ttx1"">_______________</P><P class=""fn""><SUP><A id=""chapter02x-ch2_fn1"" href=""/read/18813/chapter/3#chapter02x-ch2_ft1"">1</A></SUP>Nagel referred to a January 2013 presentation on BP’s Energy Outlook 2030, which provides an overview of these issues.

Seth asked how this consideration might become more widespread in business and finance decisions. She said this perspective requires identifying critical leverage points where strategic decision making can be aligned with long-term realities. Seth argued that to understand these issues, future MBAs need to embrace the concept of materiality (i.e., physical or material aspects that influence, or are influenced by, management decisions).</P><P class=""tx"">Seth explained that optimal leverage points might require that business leaders embrace nontraditional partnerships and cooperation beyond the typical scope. To succeed in these endeavors, students need “soft skills” to work across sectors and with a diverse set of stakeholders and civil society.</P><P class=""tx"">Like Nagel, Seth stressed systems thinking and wondered whether modeling should be part of the standard curriculum of business schools. Investments in energy efficiency, clean energy, and renewables pose risks as well as opportunities, she noted, but financing fossil fuels requires careful management of risks associated with the materiality of the underlying environmental challenges.</P><P class=""tx"">Michael Parr noted that DuPont derives one-quarter of its annual revenues of $40 billion from agriculture, using biochemical rather than petrochemical routes to materials and fuels. In the 1990s, DuPont was the first major U.S. company to set goals for public greenhouse gas reduction goals.

For example, a DuPont factory in Mississippi was flooded by Hurricane Katrina, despite a 24-foot protection wall, and the company set up a refugee camp at the location. The incident intensified discussions about “stranded assets” and the need for prudent long-term forecasting in light of <mark>climate change</mark> when making decisions on infrastructure investments. Business school graduates need to think in these longer time frames, beyond the pressure of “meeting the numbers” monthly or, at best, quarterly.</P><P class=""tx"">For DuPont, <mark>climate change</mark> is not just a strategic issue for long-term planning and cost savings, but also changes important markets. For example, DuPont observes current effects of <mark>climate change</mark> through shifts in its seed sales. These changes illustrate the need to adapt by developing products for new and emerging needs. In that sense, the markets react with more sensitivity than the political discourse. <mark>Climate change</mark>, Parr noted, illustrates real operational costs but also significant opportunity, and it provides the backdrop for evolving DuPont’s concept of sustainability. A lower <mark>carbon</mark> future provides business opportunities only for those who think ahead and innovate into new markets; an <mark>innovation</mark> pipeline can help markets adapt to the new realities of <mark>climate change</mark>. To capitalize on these new opportunities, new business skills are needed, including analytical capacity or basic science literacy. Parr gave as an example the use of comprehensive life-cycle analysis (LCA). A failure to grasp the full scope of a product’s LCA, he explained, means to potentially miss important business opportunities. Because energy is a fundamental driver, Parr said, business school graduates need the basic technical and analytical skills to understand how businesses embed (and potentially optimize) energy-related decisions in their operations and their products.</P><P class=""tx"">Valerie Patrick explained that Bayer is mostly removed from the end users of its products, as sales to final consumers represent only 15 percent of its revenue. To her, <mark>climate change</mark> provides a new lens and way of thinking about business, particularly with a focus on the supply chain. More frequent and stronger storms or unusually hot weather add to the cost of operations, and, particularly in Bayer’s crop business, uncertainty and unpredictability of weather can mean loss of revenue and loss of business.</P><P class=""tx"">Patrick added a challenge salient for a multinational business: reputation.

To capitalize on these opportunities, however, requires the ability to learn as a fundamental organizational capacity. Business school graduates, in her opinion, require the foundational knowledge needed to “wear the <mark>climate change</mark> goggles.” This knowledge includes environmental literacy, management acumen, and the ability to understand business processes and culture or the policy environment. The business structure then needs to be set up to make it easy to employ skilled people in appropriate functions, something that supports strategic execution: That is, the willingness to take action today and engage the resources for tomorrow’s benefits and to monitor progress in order to ensure that strategic goals are being met. Her expectations for business school graduates include thought leadership and enterprise management, and the ability to assess the materiality of risk. Patrick explained that it is in the latter area where companies experience the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>. Future business leaders need to be able to execute change management to align their operations to new conditions, something that requires innovative thinking in making the business case beyond the return on investment, for instance by monetizing as many intangibles such as “biodiversity” as possible for a business decision. Patrick summarized her priorities in training future business leaders in the following way: Leaders need the capacity for system thinking; to be creative and flexible; and to establish a culture of problem-solving inside and outside their company to convene, lead, and activate strategic partnerships with unlikely partners.</P><P class=""h2"">CULTIVATING SYSTEMS THINKING</P><P class=""tx"">In response to a question about how to best cultivate system thinking, the panel pointed to the importance of first-hand and practical experiences. Also helpful are good cases with implicit models that allow the creation of system maps, which visualize key points of leverage and help people see their roles within the overall system. This may require some level of scientific literacy to manage uncertainty within the context of LCA. Additionally, panelists commented, business leaders need to develop the willingness and ability to listen and talk to a variety of people, particularly those who might disagree with them, in order to expand their own thinking and help address broader needs with limited internal and external opposition.</P><P class=""h2"">PREPARATION OF MBAs</P><P class=""tx"">Panelists were asked if they are looking for MBAs who have the requisite knowledge and skills or, if not, if they provide relevant training in-</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""page"" data-page=""14"" data-display=""14"" data-format=""html""><DIV class=""page-tools""><DIV class=""page-tools-inner""><SPAN class=""page-number"">Page 14 </SPAN><SPAN class=""page-actions""><SPAN class=""page-actions-inner""><A href=""#"" class=""page-action share addthis_button"" title=""Share this page"" addthis:url=""http://www.nap.edu/read/18813/page/14"" id=""atic""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Share</SPAN></A><A href=""#"" class=""page-action cite"" title=""Cite this page""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Cite</SPAN></A></SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""page-tools-panel""><DIV class=""panel-citation""><STRONG>Suggested Citation:</STRONG>&quot;2 Dealing with <mark>Climate Change</mark>: The Business Perspective.&quot; National Research Council.  2014. <EM><mark>Climate Change</mark> Education: Preparing Future and Current Business Leaders: A Workshop Summary</EM>.

While the panel members acknowledged some forms of on-the-job professional development, they said companies gravitate toward applicants who bring the requisite basic skill set, like a level of science literacy.</P><P class=""tx"">In answering a question on where these ideas fit in the core curriculum of business schools, Nagel said business schools should not move away from the basic core curriculum, but rather bring some of these ideas alive through examples and tools within the core education. Patrick, on the other hand, said she wishes more attention were paid to environmental science aspects that undergird all businesses.</P><P class=""tx"">Another question touched on developing skills to prepare future business leaders to solve problems rather than manage dilemmas. As a concrete case, how would one prepare business leaders to make a choice not to locate a business near a vulnerable area? Parr responded that students need to be taught in the core curriculum to think about markets more broadly and to include externalities to see where markets may be going. He referenced assets that cannot be moved and might require expensive adaptation if market forces change, be it for <mark>climate change</mark> or other reasons. Seth added that students need to learn how to ask the right questions about managing risks and to bring these risks and dilemmas up in appropriate decision points and planning sessions.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""openbook-image"" class=""hide""><DIV class=""page"" data-page=""9"" data-display=""9"" data-format=""image""><DIV class=""page-image""><DIV class=""page-tools""><DIV class=""page-tools-inner""><SPAN class=""page-number"">Page 9 </SPAN><SPAN class=""page-actions""><SPAN class=""page-actions-inner""><A href=""#"" class=""page-action share addthis_button"" title=""Share this page"" addthis:url=""http://www.nap.edu/read/18813/page/9"" id=""atic""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Share</SPAN></A><A href=""#"" class=""page-action cite"" title=""Cite this page""><SPAN class=""icon-text"">Cite</SPAN></A></SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""page-tools-panel""><DIV class=""panel-citation""><STRONG>Suggested Citation:</STRONG>&quot;2 Dealing with <mark>Climate Change</mark>: The Business Perspective.&quot; National Research Council.  2014. <EM><mark>Climate Change</mark> Education: Preparing Future and Current Business Leaders: A Workshop Summary</EM>.

    			13 April 2017    		</SPAN><DIV class=""intro-detail""><P><STRONG>In the coming weeks, the EU Commission will be deciding if it will approve the mega-merger of multinational agribusiness corporations Bayer and Monsanto.</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""itemFullText""><P> The Commission has already allowed two other agribusiness mergers to go forward, that of DuPont-Dow Chemical and Syngenta-ChemChina, setting a dangerous precedent for this third merger which will further concentrate power over our food supply. Allowing such mega-mergers to happen presents a serious threat to farmers, consumers, the environment and biodiversity, and shrinks the space for <mark>sustainable</mark> alternatives to flourish. Over 200 organizations, including CIDSE, recently sent an open letter to the European Commission to oppose these mergers.</P><P> </P><P><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Here are 5 reasons why this mega-merger needs to be stopped:</SPAN></P><P><STRONG>1. It will not feed the planet</STRONG></P><P>It is often said that industrial agriculture is the solution to overcoming hunger in the world, and should be promoted in developing countries. In fact, the type of chemical-reliant agriculture put forward by agribusiness corporations like Bayer and Monsanto goes hand in hand with the cultivation of monocultures such as soy and palm oil, which encourages land grabs that deny small-scale farmers access to land to cultivate. It is these farmers who have the capacity to feed their communities, but a merger such as this one would give unprecedented power to a few corporations to influence policies and control our food supply, pushing out small-scale farmers and the domestic policies they need to support their local, healthy and diversified production.</P><P>2<STRONG>. Say goodbye to variety at the grocery store</STRONG></P><P>If this merger goes forward, the use of chemicals and the reliance on external inputs that goes along with the production of monocultures will become increasingly prevalent, which will threaten the resilience and food sovereignty of communities. It would strip away the ability of communities and consumers to choose the foods they want to produce and eat. The move towards high-yielding genetically-modified crops that rely heavily on chemicals and pesticides has already substantially reduced biodiversity and this will only intensify if agribusinesses concentrate their power and monopolize the food chain.</P><P><STRONG>3. Farmers will lose control over their seeds</STRONG></P><P>Not only are these corporations patenting farmers’ seeds, they are benefitting from unjust trade rules. Experience has already shown that free trade agreements can give agribusinesses precedence over domestic authority if local laws are seen to interfere in their capacity to do business and make profit. Colombia is a case in point. When a trade agreement was signed with the US, Colombian farmers had their crops confiscated and burned after being told that they were in violation of the trade agreement for using “illegal” seeds. These seeds were ones that farmers had kept from the year’s previous crops, a tradition that contributes to biodiversity and resilience. With this merger, Bayer-Monsanto would control 60% of the world’s seed supply. This will strengthen their power over decision making at various levels, therefore further restricting farmers’ choices and increasing dependence on the technology packages offered by these companies.</P><P><STRONG>4. It will become harder to enjoy nature</STRONG></P><P>The mass use of toxic pesticides and chemical inputs are already a serious threat to bees, which pollinate our gardens and natural environment. The toxins from pesticides are finding their way into water sources, in the food chain of insect and birds and humans as well. By eliminating competition between Bayer and Monsanto, the two main producers of pesticides, there would be little incentive for the development of alternatives that are less damaging to the environment and our health. It will not only become harder to enjoy nature because many species will be at risk of disappearing, but our own health may make it harder as well.</P><P><STRONG>5. Hello <mark>climate change</mark></STRONG></P><P>Industrial agriculture is heavily reliant on fossil fuels and at a time when ambitious efforts are needed to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, a merger such as this one could be disastrous. It could contribute to rising temperatures and curb needed investments in <mark>sustainable</mark> solutions such as agroecology that will help to cool the planet and feed its population. <mark>Climate change</mark> will only foster more frequent droughts and unstable weather patterns, and the homogeneous and sterile seeds proposed by agribusinesses are not adapted to be resilient against these climatic disturbances.</P><P>If this merger - and the concentration of power over the food chain that it entails - is given the green light, it will lock us onto a dangerous path. CIDSE believes that agroecology and food sovereignty should be the main pillars of any policy that truly aims to tackle food insecurity, build resilience in the face of uncertainty and <mark>climate change</mark>, support food producers by ensuring their rights and increase biodiversity. Such mergers only serve to strengthen a model that is preventing us from building a better future, one where a <mark>climate</mark> collapse and food crises can be avoided.</P><P><STRONG>Help stop the corporate control of agriculture</STRONG> by signing the following petition (https://act.wemove.eu/campaigns/stop-monster-merger-baysanto).

These included incumbents who have been embraced by the Tea Party such as Jim DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina, and the notorious <mark>climate change</mark> denier James Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma.</P><P>The <A href=""http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2010/10/24/<mark>climate</mark>.pdf"" title=""report"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">report</A>, released tomorrow, used information on the <A href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Open Secrets.org</A> database to track what it called a co-ordinated attempt by some of Europe's biggest polluters to influence the US midterms. It said: &quot;The European companies are funding almost exclusively Senate candidates who have been outspoken in their opposition to comprehensive <mark>climate policy</mark> in the US and candidates who actively deny the scientific consensus that <mark>climate change</mark> is happening and is caused by people.&quot;</P><P>Obama and Democrats have accused corporate interests and anonymous donors of trying to hijack the midterms by funnelling money to the Chamber of Commerce and to conservative Tea Party groups. The Chamber of Commerce reportedly has raised $75m (£47m) for pro-business, mainly Republican candidates.</P><P>&quot;Oil companies and the other special interests are spending millions on a campaign to gut clean-air standards and clean-energy standards, jeopardising the health and prosperity of this state,&quot; Obama told a rally in California on Friday night.</P><P>Much of the speculation has focused on Karl Rove, the mastermind of George Bush's victories, who has raised $15m for Republican candidates since September through a new organisation, American Crossroads. An NBC report warned that Rove was spearheading an effort to inject some $250m in television advertising for Republican candidates in the final days before the 2 November elections.</P><P>But Rove, appearing today on CBS television's Face the Nation, accused Democrats of deploying the same tactics in 2008. &quot;The president of the US had no problem at all when the Democrats did this,&quot; he said. &quot;It was not a threat to democracy when it helped him get elected.&quot;</P><P>The Cane report said the companies, including BP, BASF, Bayer and Solvay, which are some of Europe's biggest emitters, had collectively donated $240,200 to senators who blocked action on global warming – more even than the $217,000 the oil billionaires and Tea Party bankrollers, David and Charles Koch, have donated to Senate campaigns.</P><P>The biggest single donor was the German pharmaceutical company Bayer, which gave $108,100 to senators. BP made $25,000 in campaign donations, of which $18,000 went to senators who opposed action on <mark>climate change</mark>. Recipients of the European campaign donations included some of the biggest <mark>climate</mark> deniers in the Senate, such as Inhofe of Oklahoma, who has called global warming a hoax.</P><P>The foreign corporate interest in America's midterms is not restricted to Europe.

The Monsanto boss is hopeful that the proposed merger would pass in all jurisdictions, since &quot;the overlap between the two [companies] is really quite small.&quot; </P><P>But last month, several U.S. state attorneys generals <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/monsanto-bayer-merger-2084832217.html"" target=""_blank"">reportedly</A> joined federal antitrust investigations of the pending multibillion dollar deal. One concern is Bayer and Monsanto's overlapping cotton seeds. Bayer licenses genetic traits that make seeds resistant to the herbicide Liberty, while Monsanto licenses traits that make seeds resistant to its herbicide <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/15-health-problems-linked-to-monsantos-roundup-1882002128.html"" target=""_blank"">Roundup</A>.</P><P>Monsanto and Bayer control the two top cotton seed brands in the U.S., respectively—or about <A href=""http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/37971-monsanto-bayer-the-year-of-merging-dangerously"" target=""_blank"">70 percent</A> of all cotton acreage in the country.</P><P>&quot;One of the worst things you could do is to link Liberty and Roundup in the same company,&quot; Peter Carstensen, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin and leading agricultural antitrust expert, explained to the <A href=""http://www.stltoday.com/business/columns/david-nicklaus/antitrust-issues-may-force-bayer-to-offer-monsanto-a-breakup/article_df777087-41cc-56f5-b3a0-5dcab6abf513.html"" target=""_blank"">St. Louis Dispatch</A>. &quot;There's no incentive for somebody to develop a third alternative.&quot;</P><P>Critics of the takeover have <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/bayer-monsanto-merger-gmos-2013685310.html"" target=""_blank"">many concerns</A> including increased prices for farmers and consumers due to reduced competition, the monopolization of the global food supply and the proliferation of pesticides.</P><P>In September, when Monsanto and Bayer first announced the deal, Sen. Bernie Sanders <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-monsanto-m-a-bayer-antitrust-idUSKCN11K2LG"" target=""_blank"">called</A> the proposed consolidation, &quot;a threat to all Americans ... These mergers boost the profits of huge corporations and leave Americans paying even higher prices.&quot;</P><P>However, after yesterday's vote that was supported by <A href=""http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/monsanto-shareholders-approve-merger-with-bayer/article_972a7342-f2d3-561f-8870-92677b3a9d2b.html"" target=""_blank"">approximately 99 percent</A> of shareholders, Grant seemed confident the merger would pass regulatory reviews. </P><P>The companies' executives believe that a successful merger would be beneficial for farmers and help address global agriculture issues such as <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/<mark>climate</mark>-change/""><mark>climate change</mark></A> and food scarcity.</P><P>&quot;The acquisition of Monsanto is driven by our strong belief that this combination can help address the growing challenges facing farmers and the overall agriculture industry today and in the future,&quot; Werner Baumann, CEO of <mark>Bayer AG</mark>, said in a statement after the vote. </P><P>The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) disagrees. The environmental organization has concerns that the potential mega-corporation would have control of 29 percent of the market for seeds and 28 percent for pesticides—a threat to farmers, consumers, bees and other pollinators, as well as the environment. </P><P>&quot;The existence of such a powerful player would substantially harm both farmers and the environment by decreasing competition and <mark>innovation</mark>, resulting in increased costs, and allowing for greater corporate control over farmers' planting choice. It's lose-lose for farmers and consumers,&quot; the organization said. &quot;Of particular concern to NRDC is that the merger would reinforce the chemical-intensive growing practices currently threatening bees and wild pollinators that support between $200-600 billion worth of crops in the global food supply.&quot; </P><P>On Monday, the NRDC filed a <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/letter-to-doj-re-bayer-monsanto-merger-20161212.pdf"" target=""_blank"">letter</A> with the U.S. Department of Justice objecting to the proposed takeover. The specific concerns are:</P><UL class=""ee-ul""><LI><STRONG>Eliminate competition and <mark>innovation</mark>: </STRONG>Cottonseed is a good example of the threat. Bayer controls 38.5 percent of the cottonseed market; Monsanto controls about 31 percent. Together the chemical giant would control nearly 70 percent of the total market, an unacceptably high level of dominance by antitrust standards.</LI></UL><UL class=""ee-ul""><LI><STRONG>Increase costs and limit planting options for farmers: </STRONG>Past consolidation in the agricultural chemical marketplace has increased costs for farmers. For example, there was a 4-fold increase in the price of corn seed over the last 20 years without corresponding benefit in yields. The price of corn per bushel is now about the same it was 20 years ago.</LI></UL><UL class=""ee-ul""><LI><STRONG>Accelerate chemical-intensive agricultural techniques that threaten the existence of pollinators and imperil the global food supply: </STRONG>Pollinators are under severe threat as 90 percent of the monarch population has been lost in the last two decades, and nearly half of managed honey bee colonies die every year. Wild bees are also devastated by pesticide practices; the Rusty Patched bumble bee is now up for listing as an endangered species.</LI></UL><P>“Consolidating Monsanto and Bayer would escalate the use of dangerous toxic pesticides and create a bad deal for farmers, bees, consumers and the planet,&quot; NRDC senior attorney Rebecca Riley said. &quot;The Department of Justice should reject this proposal.&quot;  </P><P>The NRDC's letter also notes that other major agribusinesses also plan to combine, including ChemChina with Syngenta AG and Dow Chemical with DuPont.  </P><P>&quot;Mergers are a big win in a corporate boardroom, but out on the farm, consolidation just means higher costs,&quot; Riley said. </P><P>The deal now faces a lengthy regulatory review and is expected to close by the end of 2017. Incidentally, the election of <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/trump-watch/"" target=""_blank"">Donald Trump</A> might be a boost to Bayer's purchase of Monsanto. While the president-elect campaigned on blocking mega-deals such as AT&amp;T Inc's purchase of Time Warner Inc, Trump's nominee for attorney general—Sen. Jeff Sessions, a pro-business conservative from Alabama—is good news for any pending mergers. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""sPost_0_4_0_0_0_1_1_0_0_0_1_0_1"" class=""post-partial article__comments""><DIV class=""article-content__comments-wrapper""><DIV class=""action-btn js-toggle js--active"" data-target=""#comments-widget"" data-toggle-class=""hidden"">Show Comments (</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

I asked Monsanto CEO Hugh Grant about the merger rumors on Tuesday, when he visited us at the Brainstorm E conference in California. He refused to discuss the Bayer deal in particular. But <A href=""http://fortune.com/2016/05/17/monsanto-ceo-feeding-planet/?iid=sr-link5"">what he did say </A>makes clear why these merger talks are happening now.</P><P>Grant believes agriculture is very much a part of the new industrial revolution, and the successful company of the future will need to use data about soil and weather to offer farmers precise and targeted advice about the seeds and chemicals they need to use. The company of the future won’t just be selling seeds and chemicals, but seeds and chemicals and data as a service. That’s why Monsanto acquired the <mark>Climate</mark> Company; that’s why it attempted, unsuccessfully, to buy Swiss-based chemical company Syngenta <A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""syt"">(syt)</A>; and that’s why Bayer is now after Monsanto.</P><P>“Its funny because ag is kind of slow moving until you are up close to it, and then it’s suddenly very dynamic,” Grant told me. “The key in this is how to provide better information to help in those 40 interlocked decisions that inexorably a grower is going to make every single year. There is a future business opportunity – and it is getting much clearer – in how you do that.”</P><P>Critics are certain to cite the antitrust implications of creating a giant new company with $67 billion in sales. But Grant sees this integrated approach as critical to feeding a world that’s careening toward 10 billion people with middle class appetites.</P><P>“There is no new dirt,” he said. “We need to get much smarter societally about how we farm.”</P><P>By the way, Dow CEO Andrew Liveris, <A href=""http://fortune.com/video/2016/05/17/putting-a-price-on-nature/"">also at Brainstorm E</A>, said similar logic is behind his plans to combine Dow <A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""dow"">(dow)</A> with DuPont <A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""dd"">(dd)</A>, and then spin off three companies – one of which will provide integrated seed and chemical services to farmers.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

                  </DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""article-body"" class=""article content body clearfix"" data-tracking-zone=""body""><DIV class=""padded""><P>The pharmaceutical giant Bayer has made a remarkable—and lucrative—discovery. Allergies are on the rise. The company’s eye and nose ointment Bepanthen, already good for more than $200 million in annual sales, could soon be in even higher demand.</P><P>Bayer mentions this in its annual response to the watchdog CDP, formerly the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project, which surveys the greenhouse gas emissions of the world’s largest corporations. The CDP celebrates companies that cut <mark>carbon</mark>, of course, but also celebrates brutal honesty, awarding prizes and A rankings to those that give a true and full accounting of how <A href=""http://topics.time.com/<mark>climate</mark>-change/""><mark>climate change</mark></A> could affect their bottom lines. Bayer is a winner on both counts. Though still high, its emissions are down nearly 40% from 1990 levels. And the company is transparent about what it believes a warming world will bring.</P><P>One of Bayer’s latest products is “a new generation of mosquito net,” the LifeNet. It also has two advanced bug sprays in the pipeline. These will be lucrative because mosquitoes and the disease they carry are expected to thrive in a warmer world, leaving another 40 to 60 million people at risk of malaria in <A href=""http://topics.time.com/africa/"">Africa</A> alone. “In light of an expected <mark>climate</mark>-change-related increase of malaria incidents in further regions of the world (e.g., Northern <A href=""http://topics.time.com/europe/"">Europe</A>), we expect a growing demand for Bayer mosquito nets,” the company <A href=""http://www.sustainability2012.bayer.com/en/cdp-report.pdfx?forced=true"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">writes</A>.</P><P>For agriculture, the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>—”water shortages, heat, excessive rainfall”—will be devastating. But Bayer’s insecticide Confidor and its expanding line of genetically modified rice and cereal plants could profitably take out some of the sting. Even a future of superstorms could be a boon. “One example,” writes Bayer, “is the provision of high-performance poly<mark>carbon</mark>ate materials for the construction of exposed buildings, leading to superior stability in the case of storms or other extreme weather events.” For existing structures, the company recommends its spray-on product Baytec, which leaves a thick coating of weatherproof polyurethane.</P><P>Bayer is not alone in seeing opportunities in a hotter planet. In Australia’s <mark>climate</mark>-stressed bread belt, the Murray-Darling basin, and its analog in the American West, the Colorado River basin, hedge funds have bought up millions of gallons worth of water rights. Other funds, convinced that commodity prices can only keep rising, are part of a new scramble for Africa in which as many as 100,000 square miles of farmland—an area larger than the United Kingdom—have been leased or purchased by foreign investors. Meanwhile, at least two of Manhattan’s most storied investment banks have played farmer in Ukraine, where milder temperatures heighten the appeal of some of the richest soil in the world.</P><P>In the Netherlands, the stock of the seawall building company Arcadis jumped by 6% the moment New York City—a potential client—was struck by Hurricane Sandy. Up in the melting Arctic, ship traffic has risen 20-fold in three years over the top of Russia on the Northern Sea Route. And receding sea ice puts an even greater prize within reach: oil. Royal Dutch Shell, which in 2008 paid a record $2.1 billion for leases in Alaska’s untapped Chukchi Sea, has told investors that the high north will someday be its number one source of crude. Even in Greenland, the Danish territory synonymous with the slow-moving disaster that is <mark>climate change</mark>, people have found something to celebrate. Petroleum and precious metal deposits made more accessible by the melting ice are so vast that native Greenlanders recently voted to leave Denmark and its subsidies behind. They will gradually drill their way to independence. The world will gain a new country even as others sink beneath rising seas.</P><P>Americans often frame <mark>climate change</mark> as a tragedy of the commons: We all pursue our selfish lives, we all emit, and together we all will someday pay. But this is a dangerous way to understand the future and our responsibilities to it. That some are planning to get rich from the warming world only underscores the reality of <mark>climate change</mark>: Its impacts, though mostly bad for most people in most places, are deeply uneven.</P><P>It happens that those largely responsible for the historic emissions that got us here—wealthy North Americans and Europeans—are the most likely to stay relatively prosperous, because we have our northerly geographies and we have enough money in our wallets for, say, high-performance poly<mark>carbon</mark>ate building materials. It happens that those least responsible for historic emissions, the equatorial and the poor, are the most likely to see the worst impacts, likely to get poorer faster. This unevenness suggests that self-interest, however rational, may never be enough to jumpstart real <mark>climate</mark> action in the wealthy countries where it’s most needed. It’s hard to scare people into cutting emissions if they’re not actually all that scared.</P><P>There’s nothing wrong with selling mosquito nets, and there’s nothing wrong with buying them. But there’s something wrong if we ignore the true ethical stakes as an ever more imbalanced world keeps lurching ahead, blithely thinking, “At least we’re all in this together.”</P><P><EM>McKenzie Funk writes for </EM>Harper’s, Outside, National Geographic<EM>, and </EM>Rolling Stone,<EM> and is the author of </EM><A href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594204012/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1594204012&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wwfjw-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Windfall: The Booming Business of Global Warming<EM> (The Penguin Press, 2014).</EM></A></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""bottom-recirc padded-mobile "" data-tracking-zone=""bottom-recirc""><DIV class=""component lead-gen clearfix bottom-recirc"" data-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3365&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABPFT&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-mobile-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3365&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABPFT&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-partial=""sponsored-tile"" data-variation=""bottom-recirc"" data-title=""SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT"" data-provider=""dianomi"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-bottom-recirc"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-right-rail"" data-logo=""http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png"" data-logo_url=""https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&amp;utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank"" data-native_ad=""%7B%22dimensions%22%3A%22482x100%22%2C%22placement%22%3A%22footer%22%2C%22priority%22%3A6%7D"" data-nativekey=""KRVQvVbckcRMP4FTYBYnvWqY""><DIV class=""title-wrapper""><H3 class=""subtitle"">SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Bayer MaterialScience is focussing on buildings in the office, industrial, and social amenities sector, a field that has remained somewhat neglected up till now. Working in cooperation with partners, the Bayer subgroup has developed the EcoCommercial Building, a brand new concept for zero-emissions buildings. Insulation materials are crucial to this project. Alongside the fact that the EcoCommercial Building generates its own renewable energies, these materials ensure that buildings of this type can fulfil their own energy needs independently – and achieve a <mark>CO2</mark>-neutral status as an annual average. What is special about this concept is that it can be adapted to the world’s different <mark>climate</mark> zones. In warm regions, buildings must be insulated against the heat, while in cool regions they must be protected against the cold. Bayer itself is constructing the first EcoCommercial Buildings in two different <mark>climate</mark> zones. The Group’s new administrative premises currently under construction near New Delhi will consume 70 percent less electrical energy than buildings constructed using methods common in this subtropical region of India. Meanwhile, in the more moderate <mark>climate</mark> of Germany, Bayer is building an emissions-neutral company kindergarten at its Monheim site. </P></DIV><DIV class=""elementHeadline"" id=""anchor_8a3b90bd_The-Bayer-<mark>Climate</mark>-Check-""><H3>The Bayer <mark>Climate</mark> Check </H3></DIV><DIV class=""elementText""><P>Bayer Technology Services developed the Bayer <mark>Climate</mark> Check with the aim of increasing energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in industrial production. This enables the company to run checks on production sites worldwide to determine their impact on the <mark>climate</mark> and identify areas where there is potential to cut emissions. The new feature of this tool is that it also includes the pre-production processes – raw materials, energy, and logistics – in the analysis. Bayer plans to use the <mark>Climate</mark> Check to examine over 100 production sites worldwide by the end of 2009, thereby recording information on around 85 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions. Steps will then be taken to make full and intelligent use of any potential savings identified. Initial results reveal that the Bayer <mark>Climate</mark> Check can help the Group to cut its current greenhouse gas emissions by around 10 percent. In addition, the company will also take the <mark>Climate</mark> Check into account when making decisions on new investments. This new style of <mark>climate</mark> check is TÜV-certified and will also be made available to other interested companies</P></DIV><DIV class=""elementHeadline"" id=""anchor_5ca68e96_Stress-resistant-plants-and-biofuels""><H3>Stress-resistant plants and biofuels</H3></DIV><DIV class=""elementText""><P><mark>Climate change</mark> is threatening to further exacerbate issues such as heat and drought that are already reducing the agricultural yield of crops by up to 80 percent. At the same time, the increasing demand for biofuels is leading to competition between energy crops and food crops for the limited amount of land available for cultivation. In an attempt to resolve this issue, Bayer is employing a double-pronged approach.In one project, researchers from Bayer CropScience are seeking to make plants more resistant to stress factors such as drought, heat, cold, and soil salinity by unlocking the potential offered by biotechnology. The ultimate aim is to safeguard and even increase crop yields. With its other project in this field, Bayer is committed to helping ensure biofuels are used sustainably. To that end, the company is investigating the potential of the jatropha plant as part of a research alliance. This plant is inedible and grows in arid soil that is unsuitable for planting food crops. Consequently, it does not conflict with the production of foodstuffs. However, its seeds comprise 30 percent oil and can therefore be used to make biodiesel. </P></DIV><DIV class=""elementHeadline"" id=""anchor_3443c2bc_Saving-energy-in-other-ways-----company-vehicles--business-trips--and-IT""><H3>Saving energy in other ways – company vehicles, business trips, and IT</H3></DIV><DIV class=""elementPicture""><DIV id=""d_41505377d4b138f3a74d6f8b7ca9bacf"" class=""pictureLeft"" style=""width:286px""><DIV class=""pictureSubtitle"">The chemical park in Leverkusen

In the first year of the <mark>climate</mark> program, the accelerated introduction of company cars with low-consumption engine technology and alternative drive systems (e.g., hybrid) in 20 countries resulted in a 5 percent reduction in associated greenhouse gas emissions. Today’s cutting-edge video-conferencing technology now offers an appealing alternative form of communication that dispenses with many of the disadvantages of teleconferencing. This technology means it is possible to generate life-size representations of video conference participants, creating a realistic meeting scenario and allowing non-verbal communication. In cases where there is no need for someone to be present in person, these telepresence rooms prevent staff from having to travel long distances to attend meetings. Bayer has set up the first such telepresence rooms equipped with the latest video technology at its Group headquarters in Leverkusen (Germany) and at the Pittsburgh site in the United States. Other key Bayer sites are set to follow suit.In any large company, IT also offers the potential for making sizeable energy savings. Using a range of measures, Bayer has set itself the task of reducing the energy consumption of its three data centres located at the Group headquarters in Leverkusen and at the sites in Pittsburgh and Singapore also by 20 percent by 2012. This project includes energy-saving concepts for server installation and computer usage, in addition to reductions in paper consumption. To make optimum use of the current of air needed to cool computer chips, for example, computers will be set up in such a way that cold and warm air is kept apart as much as possible. </P></DIV><DIV class=""elementHeadline"" id=""anchor_c1d2c987_Promoting-scientific-and-social-debate""><H3>Promoting scientific and social debate</H3></DIV><DIV class=""elementText""><P>Bayer is employing two initiatives to promote scientific and social debate on the challenges posed by <mark>climate change</mark>, and to recognize specific personal achievements made in this area. The Bayer <mark>Climate</mark> Award is the first international prize for outstanding contributions to fundamental <mark>climate</mark> science research. The Bayer Science &amp; Education Foundation presented the award for the first time in 2009 in Berlin to Professor emeritus Eberhard Jochem from the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and <mark>Innovation</mark> Research in Karlsruhe (Germany).

Over the past 30 years, the concept of sustainability has evolved to reflect perspectives of both the public and private sectors.  A public policy perspective would define sustainability as the satisfaction of basic economic, social, and security needs now and in the future without undermining the natural resource base and environmental quality on which life depends. From a business perspective, the goal of sustainability is to increase long-term shareholder and social value, while decreasing industry’s use of materials and reducing negative impacts on the environment.

However, companies traditionally have planned based on past weather events, and few have attempted to integrate the increasing risks associated with the changing <mark>climate</mark> into their planning and operations. Initial efforts to do so suggest that barriers and uncertainties often stand in the way, preventing companies from achieving resilience against the rising risks of <mark>climate change</mark> impacts.</P><P>This report, <EM>Weathering the Storm</EM>, provides an in-depth look at the ways multinational companies are beginning to assess and address the risks of extreme weather and other <mark>climate change</mark> impacts. The companies examined play strategic roles in the global economy in a wide range of sectors including banking and financial services, consumer goods, healthcare, information communications, manufacturing, and materials. The report is based on two complementary lines of research:</P><UL><LI>A comprehensive review of the perspectives and activities of companies listed in the Standard and Poor’s (S&amp;P) Global 100 Index, based on their reporting to the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project and in their corporate sustainability reports and annual financial filings; and</LI><LI>In-depth case studies of the practices and experiences of six companies in diverse sectors: American Water, Bayer, The Hartford Group, National Grid, Rio Tinto and Weyerhaeuser.</LI></UL><P>Together, these sources provide a detailed snapshot of the state of resilience planning among a cross-section of global companies: how they perceive and talk publicly about their <mark>climate</mark>-related risks, the steps they are taking or planning to take, and the barriers that stand in their way. The research in this report also establishes a baseline that can be used to monitor risk management activities related to <mark>climate</mark> impacts over time.</P><P>Broadly speaking, the research reveals that while the vast majority of companies recognize risks from extreme weather and <mark>climate change</mark>, and many see these risks in the present or near term, uncertainty about the precise nature, timing and severity of <mark>climate</mark> impacts often inhibits investment in resilience beyond “business as usual.” A few leading companies are taking steps to address <mark>climate</mark> risks where they see significant opportunities to become more efficient, reduce costs, or provide greater value to customers—in other words, where there is a clear business case to do so. By and large, however, the business response thus far is largely a continuation of existing practices based on a historical picture of past risks, and often fails to adequately consider changing <mark>climate</mark> and weather conditions. Thus, the most common strategy for addressing <mark>climate</mark>-related risks leaves most companies without the resilience they need to weather future physical impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Beyond these broad conclusions, the report outlines a set of more detailed findings on prevailing attitudes and practices among S&amp;P Global 100 companies. And, to help encourage and inform stronger resilience efforts, it lays out a four-step framework for managing <mark>climate</mark> risks that incorporates the emerging best practices from case-study companies already working to prepare for the very likely prospect of increasing extreme weather and <mark>climate change</mark> impacts.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Concerns abound over concentration in the seed market.</P><DIV class=""picBox full""><P>Monsanto has been the target of worldwide protests</P></DIV><DIV class=""group""><DIV class=""longText""><P>This past May, environmentalists amassed in cities around the world once again for their annual &quot;March Against Monsanto,&quot; which for four years has been protesting the world's most infamous producer of genetically modified crops. But next year, the demonstrators will longer have a Monsanto to protest against.</P><P>The protesters haven't succeeded in shutting the company down. On the contrary, the firm has become so successful that one of Germany's largest companies has <A href=""/en/bayer-takes-over-monsanto-in-mega-deal/a-19553361"">acquired it</A> for $66 billion (59 billion euros).</P><P>Monsanto's merger with Bayer, the international chemical and pharmaceutical company most famous for producing Aspirin, is the largest-ever foreign takeover bid from a German company. Both companies produce pesticides, and together would control 28 percent of the global pesticide market. Bayer's offer was sealed on Wednesday (14.09.2016).</P><P>The size of the combined company will invite close scrutiny by competition regulators. But its potentially dominant position in the agrochemical field has also raised alarm on environmental grounds.</P><P>Opponants are now pinning their hopes on the European Commission in Brussels, which still must approve or reject the merger.</P><P>But Jan Pehrke from the German nongovernmental organization Coalition Against Bayer-Dangers says a rejection is highly unlikely. &quot;I think we can't stop the merger at this point, it's done,&quot; he says.</P><P>The commission is likel to act, he thinks - but added that this probably won't do enough. &quot;They may force Bayer to sell its cotton business, or some of its pesticide businesses, because of competition concerns. But they can't force a rollback of the new combined concentration in the market,&quot; Pehrke told DW.</P><P><STRONG>Burying a tarnished brand</STRONG></P><P>The reaction has been particularly strong in Germany, where the German public is widely opposed to genetically modified crops, or GMOs. US-based Monsanto pulled out of the GMO market in Europe years ago because of the EU's de facto moratorium on growing such crops. But the company continues to be involved in importing GMO crops into the EU.</P><P>Monsanto has become the main target of the anti-GMO movement globally - particularly in Europe, where it faces ongoing controversy over its most widely-used weed killer <A href=""/en/delay-on-glyphosate-decision-leaves-eu-farmers-in-limbo/a-19270097"">glyphosate</A>, which environmentalists continue to seek to ban.</P><P>Although EU authorization for glyphosate ran out this past June, the European Commission gave it a provisional extension, for 18 months.</P><DIV class=""picBox	full

""><P>One of Monsanto's key products - glyphosate - faces a possible ban by the EU</P></DIV><P>Many observers expect Bayer to drop the Monsanto name. Asked by the German newspaper &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung&quot; whether Bayer would bury the Monsanto brand, Bayer chief executive Werner Baumann had said: &quot;Suffice to say that Bayer enjoys an excellent reputation and appeal worldwide. We must take advantage of that.&quot;</P><P>Though Bayer is involved in many of the same activities, it has escaped negative public perception in Europe that its American counterpart has.</P><P>Jan Perhke, who is also with the Coalition Against Bayer-Dangers, says it has been harder to make the public aware of Bayer's pesticide activities because it is involved in more diversified activity than Monsanto - which deals mostly in seeds and GMOs.</P><P>&quot;We have tried to put the focus not only on Monsanto, and to let people know that behind Monsanto there are many agrochemical multinationals which are very big and also have very dangerous products,&quot; he told DW.</P><P>He worries that with the relatively less-tarnished and more politically powerful Bayer name behind the Monsanto GMO products, the European Union will not be able to maintain its <A href=""/en/two-thirds-of-eu-states-to-ban-gm-crop-cultivation/a-18831219"">Two-thirds of EU states to ban GM crop cultivation</A>de facto moratorium# on growing genetically modified crops.</P><P>&quot;We are now afraid that if a big German enterprise like Bayer is so big in GMOs, there will be more pressure to put GMOs on the EU market,&quot; he says. Bayer has known that there will be protests, Pehrke thinks.</P><P>&quot;They have announced that they will offer a tour to investors to tell them why the merger is good, and why the bad reputation of Monsanto isn't going to have an influence on the profits of Bayer.&quot;</P><DIV class=""picBox	full

""><P>Bayer executives say they are willing to meet with environmentalists to discuss their concerns</P></DIV><P><STRONG>Lessons learned</STRONG></P><P>For their part, Bayer executives appear keen to avoid early mistakes that led to Monsanto having such an image problem in Europe - such as a lack of engagement with policy-makers and environmental groups. Baumann told the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung&quot; that the company is inviting campaigners to talk to Bayer's management.</P><P>&quot;As much as I talk to our investors to convince them of the plans, the offer also stands for environmental groups and other nongovernmental organizations,&quot; he had told the newspaper. &quot;Our way of doing business may differ from the way Monsanto does. I can assure you that we would conduct these businesses based on the same standards as our other operations.&quot;</P><P>And exactly those other operations have shielded Bayer from public criticism, even as it faced controversy over some parts of its agriculture business. This includes production of neonicotinoid pesticides, which are accused of killing bees and harming biodiversity.</P><P>Brandon Mitchener, a spokesperson for Monsanto in Europe, said the company has historically been required to weather the same amount of criticism as Bayer - even if Monsanto is more in the news now because of the glyphosate issue.</P><P>&quot;Monsanto, Bayer, Syngenta and other companies are all in the same boat regarding the need to defend our activities in agriculture,&quot; Mitchener told DW. &quot;The people who oppose any <mark>innovation</mark> in agriculture are just as opposed to the neonicotinoids manufactured by Bayer and Syngenta as they are to the glyphosate products and GM seeds sold by all three.&quot;</P><DIV class=""picBox	full

""><P>At stake in the merger: the foods we eat, among numerous other products</P></DIV><P><STRONG>Seed concentration concerns</STRONG></P><P>Aside from the enhanced political heft of the new combined entity, a concentration of seed patents is also a major concern. The proposed merger comes in the context of a flurry of mergers and acquisitions in the agrochemical sector recently, as investors look to cut costs in the face of declining agricultural commodity prices.</P><P>Canadian fertilizer giants <A href=""/en/fertilizer-majors-potash-agrium-to-merge/a-19546342"">Agrium and Potash</A> in September announced their intended merger.</P><P>In February, ChemChina purchased Syngenta, making it the biggest player in the agricultural chemical market.</P><P>And last year, American chemical firms Dow and DuPont announced a $130 billion merger to create DowDuPont, which will control an estimated 40 percent of the corn and soybean seed market in the United States.</P><P>More merger announcements in the sector could be on the way, although all are subject to regulatory approval.</P><P>Sven Giegold, a Green member of the European Parliament from Germany, worked on an <A href=""http://www.sven-giegold.de/2016/bayers-uebermacht-verhindern-bitte-helft-den-monsanto-deal-zu-stoppen/"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon external"">online petition</A> to stop the Bayer-Monsanto merger.</P><P>Giegold says agrochemical consolidation is out of control, and is putting the future of farming at risk. The European Union must draw a line in the sand with this merger, he insists. And he frames this in the context of the free market.</P><DIV class=""picBox	medium


""><P>German Green representative Sven Giegold has started a petition calling on the EU to block the Bayer-Monsanto merger</P></DIV><P>&quot;The Greens are defending the idea that in a market economy, there has to be tough competition,&quot; Giegold told DW. &quot;There is already strong monopolization in the seeds and pesticides sector - more concentration in the market is unwanted,&quot; he said.</P><P>If there are only a few competitors on the seed market, farmers will be forced to buy those, often in combination with pesticides, he pointed out.</P><P>Already in 2013, the top six companies in the commercial seed sector controlled 75 percent of the agrochemical market and 63 percent of the market. The recent flurry of mergers could put all this into the hands of just three companies. If few companies own the patents for seeds, small farmers could become completely dependent on them.</P><P><STRONG>Billions against Bayer?</STRONG></P><P>Giegold acknowledged that for the moment, concern over the merger is strongest in Germany.</P><P>&quot;Right now there is a concentration of concern in Germany, because Bayer is among the companies with the worst reputation of all German companies, because of a history of scandal,&quot; Giegold said. &quot;Monsanto has become a negative symbol internationally, but this is less the case for Bayer.&quot;</P><P>But Katherine Paul, associate director of the Organic Consumers Organization that organizes the Millions Against Monsanto movement, says any name switch will not cause the anti-GMO campaigners to lose focus.</P><P>&quot;We can easily move from our 'Millions against Monsanto' campaign to a 'Billions against Bayer' campaign,&quot; she says. &quot;The public is well aware that while Monsanto has become the poster child for corporate corruption as well as corruption of the food and farming system, Monsanto isn't alone.&quot;</P><P>Civil society groups are planning a symbolic &quot;tribunal&quot; against Monsanto this October in The Hague. There will be no representative of Bayer or Monsanto at the event, but the activists hope to attract public attention to what they feel are the dangers presented by the newly enlarged agrochemical giant.</P><P>Pehrke also confirmed that the Coalition Against Bayer-Dangers will indeed rename the March Against Monsanto to the March against Bayer.</P><DIV class=""longText""><DIV class=""gallery col3""><DIV class=""imgTeaserL slideshow noDim"" data-id=""18468353"" data-title=""The immeasurable greatness of the tiny seed"" data-date=""20150522""><UL class=""slides""><LI class=""first""><DIV class=""teaserContentWrap""><H4>The immeasurable greatness of the tiny seed</H4><H2>The beloved coffee bean</H2><P>Where would we be without coffee?

Indeed, if you are a farmer, consumer, or any of the pollinators critical to our nation’s food supply and environment—such as the bees and monarch butterflies facing massive new threats from pesticides in recent years—this big business merger could be very bad news. Here’s why:</P><H4>A Shrinking Circle of Mega-Corporations</H4><P>The proposed Bayer takeover of Monsanto isn’t happening in a vacuum.  It’s part of a larger trend of consolidation in the last several decades of the largest corporations buying up other smaller agricultural companies. For example, between 1985 and 2000, the “Big Six” agricultural inputs firms—i.e., Bayer, Monsanto, the Dow Corporation, DuPont, Syngenta AG, and BASF—acquired about 75% of the small to medium companies doing agricultural biotechnology research.</P><DIV class=""img-no-float""><DIV class=""media media-element-container media-full_content""><FIGURE id=""file-11835"" class=""image-full-width file file-inline-image file-image-jpeg no-attribution has-caption""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""figcaption-element figcaption-caption"">
        Big mergers may mean more of the same pesticide-heavy industrial agriculture.         </SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV></DIV><P>Now with few smaller companies left, the Big Six are looking at gobbling up one another. In the past year, three mega mergers have been proposed that would turn the Big Six into the “Big Four:” the “<A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-20/dow-dupont-shareholders-approve-59-billion-merger-of-equals"">merger of equals</A>” between Dow and DuPont; a <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-03/chemchina-offers-to-purchase-syngenta-for-record-43-billion"">$43 billion bid</A> from the Chinese state-owned chemical company, ChemChina, for the Swiss seeds and pesticides manufacturer, Syngenta; and now the $66 billion takeover bid from Bayer for Monsanto—by far the largest, and maybe the most consequential of them all.</P><H4>Growing Costs for Farmers and Consumers</H4><P>It may come no surprise that as the number of companies making seeds and pesticides have decreased, costs have ballooned. In a striking example, while the price of corn seed has<A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/as-crop-prices-fall-farmers-focus-on-seeds-1476669901""> nearly quadrupled</A> in the last 20 years, the price per bushel for corn is roughly the same as it was at in 1996. These costs may be due, in part, to the proliferation of genetically modified seeds—skyrocketing from 25% of all U.S. corn seed planted in 2000 to <A href=""https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us.aspx"">92% of all corn seed in 2016</A>.</P><P>The Bayer takeover and other mergers are expected to drive up prices even further for farmers already struggling with seed costs. A <A href=""https://www.afpc.tamu.edu/pubs/0/675/WP_16-2.pdf"">Texas A&amp;M University study</A>, for example, found that with respect to cotton, if Bayer (which controls 38.5% of the cottonseed market) successfully acquires Monsanto (which controls 31.2%), the price of cottonseed is likely to jump anywhere from 18% to 20%.</P><P>These price spikes wouldn’t be from any value added to the seeds, but from the greater market power of the new mega-companies. In other words, farmers—and ultimately consumers—would get the pinch while Bayer and other big players would reap the rewards. For these reasons, many agricultural associations have raised serious concerns about the proposed merger, while others, like the National Farmers Union, have <A href=""https://nfu.org/2016/09/14/nfu-condemns-bayermonsanto-deal-asks-for-critical-review-of-consolidation-in-ag/"">condemned it publicly</A>.</P><H4>Bad News for Bees and Other Pollinators</H4><P>Farmers and consumers aren’t the only ones who have to worry, as the proposed Bayer takeover and other mergers also promise to cement the trend of chemical-laden agriculture now threatening our nation’s bees and other pollinators like never before.</P><DIV class=""img-no-float""><DIV class=""media media-element-container media-full_content""><FIGURE id=""file-11836"" class=""image-full-width file file-inline-image file-image-jpeg no-attribution has-caption""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""figcaption-element figcaption-caption"">
        Bayer’s proposed takeover of Monsanto may be bad news for bees, like me.  Photo by Alvesgaspar.        </SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV></DIV><P>As <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/bee-deaths-FS.pdf"">we’ve written about</A>, bees and other pollinators are critical to agriculture—pollinating about one-third of all the food we eat. Frighteningly, however, they are also dying at rates that may <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/media/2016/160226-0"">endanger the global food system</A>. Last year alone, beekeepers saw an astounding <A href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/death-rate-for-honeybees-takes-turn-for-the-worse/"">44% percent of their hives die</A>. And while they’ve been able to keep colony numbers up artificially (i.e., by splitting healthy hives into two and importing queen bees grown by breeders), many believe such practices are un<mark>sustainable</mark> if bees keep dying at record rates.</P><P>While the assault on bees is coming from multiple directions (including disease, habitat loss, and <mark>climate change</mark>), overuse of modern pesticides, <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/jennifer-sass/neonicotinoid-pesticides-still-bad-bees-two-studies-nature-journal-add"">such neonicotinoids or “neonics,”</A> is a key offender. In fact, one neonic pesticide was found to be so toxic to insects that the Canadian government just recommended <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/daniel-raichel/canada-moves-ban-bee-killing-pesticide-and-we-should-too"">banning it for almost all uses</A>, from home gardens to corn fields.</P><P>With just a handful of companies controlling both the seeds and pesticides markets, however, the chance for reducing the role of bee-toxic pesticides in agriculture is slim indeed.  Currently, most of the Big Six genetically modify seeds to make them resistant to certain pesticides, which allows farmers to dump those pesticides on their fields in large quantities before there’s actually a pest problem. Under this system, companies selling both the genetically modified seeds and the accompanying pesticides get to cash in twice.</P><P>That’s why consolidation of the Big Six to the Big Four is a big problem—because the more the pesticide manufacturers become the same people who are selling the seeds, the more incentive there is to make and market seeds in a way that accelerates the current trend of chemical-heavy growing. (Indeed, Monsanto is already working on a corn seed that “will have 14 [genetic] traits and <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/business/gmo-promise-falls-short.html?_r=0"">allow farmers to spray five different kinds of herbicide</A>”). This is especially concerning for companies like Bayer, whose bread and butter has historically been in pesticides.</P><H4>It’s Not Too Late</H4><P>With the future of our food and our pollinators at stake, it’s good to know that it’s not too late for the government to stop these mega-mergers. While not all the official paperwork has been filed yet, it’s believed that the Department of Justice will eventually perform an antitrust review of the Bayer takeover proposal—and if the Department finds that it will decrease competition (and it almost certainly will), the agency can move to prevent the merger.</P><P>Because it’s never too early to take precaution against a what could a big bad deal for all of us (bees included), we hope the Department wastes no time in scrutinizing the Bayer takeover and other mega-mergers and stops them before we’re all paying the price.</P></SPAN><DIV class=""author-teaser""><H2 class=""center-title"">About the Authors</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

And while the Department of Agriculture has launched programs to increase farmland's capacity to capture <mark>carbon</mark>, those are voluntary. The U.S.'s plans for meeting the Paris goals rely mainly on energy and transportation.</P><P>When the U.N.'s Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> launched its first global <mark>climate</mark> summit in 1992, agriculture hardly even entered the conversation. It wasn't until about a decade ago that research began to show its contribution to global warming, with special attention paid to the ravages of deforestation for agriculture, especially palm oil.</P><P>&quot;The numbers are pretty staggering. Maybe even a third of greenhouse gas emissions come from the land—more than transportation—but that wasn't clear until 10 years ago,&quot; said Seth Shames, who leads policy research for EcoAgriculture Partners, a group focused on hunger, rural poverty and biodiversity. &quot;Those issues started getting discussed in the <mark>climate change</mark> community. The forest people were able to get organized...and there was less political resistance in the <mark>climate</mark> world.&quot;</P><P>In response, the UNFCCC <A href=""http://redd.unfccc.int/"">launched a program</A> that pays developing countries to preserve their <mark>carbon</mark>-absorbing forests, including standards for measuring, reporting and verifying the emissions cuts.</P><P>Similar standards haven't been developed yet for agriculture.</P><P>&quot;Right now, we don't have mechanisms in place to really capitalize on the benefits that agriculture mitigation strategies can provide,&quot; said Ernie Shea, president of Solutions From The Land, a collaboration of agricultural industry and conservation groups. &quot;Forestry's much further ahead on measuring impacts. We're not there yet with agriculture.&quot;</P><P>The conversation around agriculture's role in <mark>climate change</mark> stems from a sea change in negotiations themselves. In 2009, the <mark>climate</mark> summit in Copenhagen fell apart, largely, some believe, because countries bristled at the top-down approach that dictated what countries must do.</P><P>After Copenhagen, negotiators began working instead on a pledge-based approach.</P><P>&quot;The Paris agreement doesn't impose anything on member states, and turns it around and says: What can you bring to the table?&quot; Frick explained. &quot;This fundamental change in logic has had a tremendous impact for agriculture. Agriculture, for every single country, is one of the most sensitive areas—it's an emotional topic.&quot;</P><P>Ultimately, agriculture emerged as ripe for action. It is existentially linked to a country's very survival and increasingly under threat from weather extremes, drought and floods. Agriculture, in other words, has to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>, but also has a huge, unrealized potential to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark>. That can happen through farm practices like soil <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration through cover cropping, or by making existing farmland more productive and efficient.</P><P>&quot;Drought impacts, flooding, higher nighttime temperatures affecting pollination, new weeds, invasive species. There's an awareness in the agriculture community that we're at risk and we're not as resilient as we need to be,&quot; Shea said.</P><P>That risk is driving the discussion. Farm industry leaders and academics formed the North American <mark>Climate</mark> Smart Agriculture Alliance in 2015 to prompt changes in agricultural practices that have <mark>climate</mark> benefits. Shea says the alliance's approach, much like the approach at the international level, is to promote the idea that certain production techniques are not only better for the environment, but also for farm productivity. The alliance's members include the American Farm Bureau Federation, which continues to deny the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;People are turned off by the <mark>climate change</mark> conversation,&quot; Shea said. &quot;Once you get into a conversation about improving productivity, you can get into a conversation about co-benefits.&quot;</P><P>Greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector in developed countries average about 12 percent, compared to 35 percent in developing countries, which makes agriculture a relatively less important solution in industrialized countries. Still, advocates are pushing agricultural interests and regulators in the U.S. to do their part, pointing <A href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.13340/abstract"">to research</A> that says reaching the goals of the Paris agreement will be impossible without agriculture's contribution.</P><P>Educating farmers about the benefits—and using them to meet Paris targets—could provide the best way forward.</P><P>&quot;There's a lot of fatigue with the negativity on <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; said Thomas Driscoll, policy director at the National Farmers Union, the U.S.'s second largest farm group. &quot;Agriculture and <mark>climate change</mark> is exciting because there's a lot that can be done. Doing the right thing for the <mark>climate</mark> can save farmers money.&quot;</P><P>But challenges lie ahead. In both developing and advanced countries, many farmers can't afford to take <mark>climate</mark>-targeted steps—such as letting land lie fallow to regenerate—unless governments provide meaningful financial incentives.</P><P>In the plans that many countries submitted to reach their <mark>climate</mark> pledges, actual details around agriculture are scarce. And only one country—Rwanda—included plans to address food waste, which <A href=""http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/"">contributes 8 percent</A> of global greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>Homing in on those details and the precise strategies for cutting emissions is the work of the coming global talks.</P><P>&quot;The next five years is going to be period where we, as a community—researchers, agronomists, NGOs—are going to start thinking about what we can do, the bundle of things we can do in agriculture,&quot; Hanson said. &quot;We're on the agenda.

Agriculture is an emissions-intensive sector; it accounted for less than 1 percent of U.S. production (in real gross value-added terms), but emitted 10 percent of U.S. GHGs in 2014. Energy-related CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission sources—which dominate GHG emissions in most other production sectors—are dwarfed in agriculture by unique crop and livestock emissions of nitrous oxide and methane. Crop and pasture soil management generates the most GHG emissions, due largely to the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers and other nutrients. Enteric fermentation (digestion in ruminant livestock) and manure management ranks second. Agriculture and forestry are unique in providing opportunities for withdrawing <mark>carbon</mark> from the atmosphere through biological sequestration in soil and biomass <mark>carbon</mark> sinks. The <mark>carbon</mark> sinks, which are largely due to land use change from agricultural to forest land (afforestation) and forest management on continuing forest, offset 11.5 percent of total U.S. GHG emissions in 2014 (see <A data-id=""15176"" href=""/topics/natural-resources-environment/<mark>climate</mark>-change/agricultural-production-and-mitigation/"" title=""Agricultural Production and Mitigation"">Agricultural Production and Mitigation</A>).</P><H3>The National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment</H3><P>The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) aims &quot;to assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.&quot; In this role, every four years it produces a National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment (NCA) that surveys and synthesizes the most recent science about <mark>climate change</mark> impacts and adaptation in the United States. ERS participated in the development of the most recent NCA, released in May 2014 (see the <A href=""http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/"" target=""_blank"" title=""2014 National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment"">2014 National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment</A>). The 2014 study reported that global warming observed over the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities. The agriculture chapter concludes that disruptions to agricultural production due to <mark>climate change</mark> have been increasing and are projected to become more severe over the foreseeable future. After 2050, the negative impacts on agriculture of increased <mark>climate</mark>-induced stress are projected to increase, due to the incidence of weeds, diseases, and insect pests, affecting productivity of most crops and livestock in addition to weather-related stresses.

In this study, the DayCent model was used to predict changes in crop biomass, soil C stocks, and N<SUB>2</SUB>O fluxes of a major agricultural area in Brazil. The model was calibrated and validated using datasets from 30-yr-old experiments. Simulations of current and alternative management practices to 2100 using IPCC <mark>climate</mark> scenarios A2 and B1 were conducted. Predicted crop biomass increases ranged from 5% (sorghum [B1]) to 65% (soybean [A2]). DayCent simulated higher soil organic <mark>carbon</mark> stocks in the wheat–soybean system (VAL1) than in the wheat–soybean–vetch–sorghum system (VAL2) in both <mark>climate</mark> scenarios. Soil organic <mark>carbon</mark> accumulation by 2100 (±16 Mg C ha<SUP>-1</SUP> above current 46 Mg C ha<SUP>-1</SUP>) was forecast in cropping systems with pastures (<EM>Cynodon</EM> sp.), regardless of the <mark>climate</mark> scenario. Daily N<SUB>2</SUB>O fluxes were underestimated by ±41% (0.85 g N–N<SUB>2</SUB>O ha<SUP>-1</SUP> d<SUP>-1</SUP>) in VAL1 and overestimated by 17.5% (0.28 g N–N<SUB>2</SUB>O ha<SUP>-1</SUP> d<SUP>-1</SUP>) in VAL2. Cumulative N<SUB>2</SUB>O fluxes produced mixed results, which were 29% lower than observed in VAL1 and 5% higher in VAL2 but within the range of values reported in other greenhouse gas studies in southern Brazil. Simulations of N<SUB>2</SUB>O fluxes to 2100 with IPCC <mark>climate change</mark> scenarios B1 and A2 in southern Brazilian indicated higher annual fluxes across the alternative treatments tested in comparison to current fluxes. According to model predictions, <mark>climate change</mark> would lead to larger relative increases in N<SUB>2</SUB>O emissions from no-tillage (27% in B1 to 41% in A2), but these enhanced fluxes would still be lower than those from tillage by approximately 25%.</P>  Please view the pdf by using the Full Text (PDF) link under 'View' to the left.<P><SPAN><SPAN xmlns="""">Copyright © 2017. </SPAN>. </SPAN>Copyright © by the Soil Science Society of America, Inc.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""three"" role=""COMPLEMENTARY"" aria-label=""Sidebar Right""><DIV class=""inside_three""><DIV id=""sidebar-right"" class=""sidebar""><DIV class=""region region-right""><DIV id=""block-dl-mlarticlestats"" class=""settings-tray-editable block block-acs-mark-logic block-acs-mark-logicblock-article-stats"" data-drupal-settingstray=""editable""><TABLE class=""siqStats""><THEAD><TR><TH colspan=""2"">Soil Science Society of America Journal</TH></TR></THEAD><TBODY><TR><TD>Articles Published</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Written by leading researchers and practitioners, it identifies practical and evidence-based policy options to inform the discourse and <mark>climate</mark> negotiations.With <mark>climate</mark>-related risks on the rise and impacts being felt around the globe has come the recognition that <mark>climate</mark> mitigation and adaptation may not be enough to manage the effects from anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>. This recognition led to the creation of the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage in 2013, a <mark>climate policy</mark> mechanism dedicated to dealing with <mark>climate</mark>-related effects in highly vulnerable countries that face severe constraints and limits to adaptation.  Endorsed in 2015 by the Paris Agreement and effectively considered a third pillar of international <mark>climate policy</mark>, debate and research on Loss and Damage continues to gain enormous traction. Yet, concepts, methods and tools as well as directions for policy and implementation have remained contested and vague.Suitable for researchers, policy-advisors, practitioners and the interested public, the book furthermore:•         discusses the political, legal, economic and institutional dimensions of the issue•         highlights normative questions central to the discourse•         provides a focus on <mark>climate</mark> risks and <mark>climate</mark> risk management.•         presents salient case studies from around the world.</DIV></DIV></DD></DL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In its CDP document, <STRONG>Bayer</STRONG> cites one estimate that <mark>climate change</mark> could result in <A href=""http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100407172811/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/Chapter_3_How_<mark>climate</mark>_change_will_affect_people_around_the_world_.pdf#page=21"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">40 million to 60 million additional people being exposed</A> [PDF] to these diseases. The company anticipates increased demand for its mosquito nets and other <A href=""http://www.vectorcontrol.bayer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">mosquito-control products</A>, especially if malaria spreads to the developed world. <STRONG>GlaxoSmithKline </STRONG>also anticipates that <mark>climate change</mark> could affect demand for its <A href=""http://news.yahoo.com/experts-urge-demo-tests-wider-malaria-vaccine-122556710--finance.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">anti-malarial products</A> and notes that if the company’s “sales rose by 1% around £300m [about $446 million] would be added to our turnover.” A GSK spokesperson added, however, that the company is developing a malaria vaccine that it would offer to African children at a “not-for-profit price,” and that under some scenarios, <mark>climate change</mark> could actually <EM>reduce </EM>demand for the company’s products.</P><P><STRONG>Novartis,</STRONG><A href=""http://www.malaria.novartis.com/malaria-initiative/treatment/first-in-class-treatment/index.shtml"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">which makes several malaria and dengue drugs</A>, points out that it has provided millions of doses to African health officials at a not-for-profit price. But, the company notes, “businesses selling these drugs will become more profitable if the diseases spread to more developed and richer countries.” A number of experts doubt that will happen, at least in the case of malaria. They argue that factors such as economic development and public health infrastructure are <A href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7296/full/nature09098.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">far more significant</A> than <mark>climate</mark> in controlling malaria. Asked for clarification, a Novartis spokesperson stated that higher temperatures and increased extreme weather from <mark>climate change</mark> could “lead to large floods, social crises and challenges, which may allow vector diseases to spread further.” Still, he added, Novartis agrees that malaria is unlikely to spread in the developed world.</P><P>Drug companies point to other health threats, as well. GSK warns that changing precipitation patterns and increased extreme weather events could “affect the spread of water-borne diseases” and respiratory and diarrheal illnesses, creating a need for “greater disease prevention and more patient treatments.” These problems could be especially serious in the poorest countries, according the GSK spokesperson. In its CDP submission, <STRONG>Merck </STRONG>says it is researching the negative impacts that higher temperatures could have on vaccines.</P><H3>Ice Cream!</H3><P>Rising temperatures don’t just drive demand for air-conditioning units and better vaccines. According <STRONG>Nestlé,</STRONG> they can also boost sales of “refreshing products such as ice creams and bottled water.” Nestlé notes that in 2014, Earth experienced its <A href=""http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/global/globe/land_ocean/3/8/1880-2015"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hottest summer on record</A> (until 2015, anyway) and that a number of the company’s local brands performed well that year. So how much of an impact does heat have? “Increased demand for bottled water and ice creams as a result of temperature increase can result in additional sales of CHF 100 million per year,” says Nestlé. In case you aren’t familiar with the exchange rate for Swiss francs, that’s about $100 million.</P><P><I>This story was originally published by <A href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/12/<mark>climate</mark>-change-business-opportunities"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Mother Jones</A></I><I>and is reproduced here as part of our </I><A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>desk.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow""><SPAN class=""s2""><I><mark>Climate</mark> Desk </I></SPAN></A><I>collaboration. </I></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER class=""article-footer-wrap"" data-reactid="".1srydz69k1i.2.1.0.0.$0.2""><DIV class=""article-footer-tags"" data-reactid="".1srydz69k1i.2.1.0.0.$0.2.2""><DIV class=""tags-body"" data-reactid="".1srydz69k1i.2.1.0.0.$0.2.2.0""><SPAN class=""tag-list-label"" data-reactid="".1srydz69k1i.2.1.0.0.$0.2.2.0.0"">Read More</SPAN></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></ARTICLE></DIV><DIV class=""grid-wrap"" data-reactid="".1srydz69k1i.2.1.0.1""><DIV class=""grid-flex"" data-reactid="".1srydz69k1i.2.1.0.1.0""><DIV class=""email-container"" data-reactid="".1srydz69k1i.2.1.0.1.0.0""><DIV class=""email-signup-form"" data-reactid="".1srydz69k1i.2.1.0.1.0.0.0""><H3 class=""email-signup-callout"" data-reactid="".1srydz69k1i.2.1.0.1.0.0.0.1"">Essential reporting, interpretation, and opinion on politics and culture.

Our aim was to discuss the findings and implications of emerging research on <mark>climate change</mark>. As I recall there was not yet a consensus among meteorologists and other scientists about interpreting observed changes, but by the early 1990s most scientists accepted that humans contributed significantly to global warming, and importantly, that it is a major risk to humanity and that it requires a managed, political response.</P><P> </P><P>This emerging consensus resulted in the UN Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> in 1992, which led to the Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997 and signed by many nations, including the US in 1998 under Clinton but not ratified by the Senate. I was part of a White House taskforce that initiated research and education efforts that attempted to lead to ratification by the US senate. We organized workshops in Washington and elsewhere, met with staffers, legislators, lobbyists, and experts. Through these, I realized that representatives opposed Kyoto not because they didn’t believe in <mark>climate change</mark>, but because it is against the immediate self-interest of their voters. Most representatives and staffers recognized the key point that <mark>climate change</mark> poses risks to society but they felt that their constituents would not want to pay the price of mitigation. Furthermore, for representatives from some regions (e.g. the Dakotas) global warming seems like <mark>climate</mark> improvement. A key feature of the Kyoto Protocol was that developed countries would reduce emissions since they contribute a greater share to GHG emissions and subsidize reductions by developing countries (they still need to grow).</P><P>
I knew of very few scientists that were skeptics (their number has declined over time), and some people denied <mark>climate change</mark> because of religious beliefs. One strategic approach of politicians who didn’t want the US and developed countries to pay the lion’s share of mitigation was to assume the role of skeptics, or even deniers of <mark>climate change</mark>. But my impression is that many of the deniers are not ignorant and do believe in science, but they do not want to pay. Someone once summarized it as “they are not stupid they are mean.”  I would not go that far though – they are driven by short term self-interest. This is not a unique situation. For example, in retrospect we have found that much of the denial of the health effects of cigarettes by tobacco companies used the same logic.</P><P> </P><P>My interpretation of some of the resistance to GMOs is similar. I was introduced to agricultural biotechnology in the late 1980s, as some of the early researchers were on campus and I knew some of them. I worked on pesticides and realized that chemical pesticides provide significant value but are costly both economically and environmentally. Development of new crop varieties, by various means (including use of radiation to generate mutations) has been an effective way to develop pest and disease control. I knew that some of the developers of new pest controlling traits aimed to reduce or replace chemical pesticides and even expand the tools of organic agriculture. They also have other goals, such as reducing dependence on fertilizers (i.e., by enhancing nitrogen fixation), improving nutritional content of food, etc. I appreciate that biotechnology relies on basic understandings of processes inside the plant. I expect, as many others, that this knowledge and its applications will improve over time as we will have more knowledge and improved tools which will lead to more <mark>sustainable</mark> diverse and efficient agriculture, allowing to improve human well-being and environmental health.</P><P>However, understandable and exaggerated concern by activists has led to excessive and costly regulations that gave major companies like Monsanto an edge in developing new products. Companies that were threatened by new biotechnology products lobbied against it. I recall that in a hearing of the <A href=""https://www.nap.edu/catalog/9598/the-future-role-of-pesticides-in-us-agriculture"">NRC committee on the future of pesticides</A>, a presentation by a Bayer official stated that GMOs have limited potential to solve pesticide problems and they recommended larger investments in chemical pesticides. It is ironic because now Bayer is acquiring Monsanto, with its relative advantage in agricultural biotechnology. Herbicide manufacturers, like the American Cyanamid Company, were affected negatively by RoundUp Ready varieties. Most of the chemical companies that were negatively affected by biotechnology were European, and Monsanto, who kept tight control of IPR, was American, and that was one of the self-interest drivers to European opposition to biotechnology. And I suspect that it even led to implicit partnerships between environmental groups and companies. There are many other political economic reasons for <A href=""http://agbioforum.org/v12n1/v12n1a04-graff.htm"">opposing GMOs</A><A href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/gmcr.26981"">in Europe</A>. The negative attitude towards GMOs spilled over to some of the public and increased the political power of the opposition. They also realized that by picketing near retailers, they could reduce the spread of the technology. This led to severe restriction on the use of GMOs in Europe, and utilization of the technology around the world. Even worse, it led to heavy restriction of the use of GMOs in developing countries, <A href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181353"">contributing to malnutrition in Africa</A> and <A href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environment-and-development-economics/article/economic-power-of-the-golden-rice-opposition/F31EE0E5B6044B86B5223FF20C409158"">blindness in South Asia</A>, among other problems. The <A href=""http://supportprecisionagriculture.org/index.html"">recent letter by many Nobel Laureates and scientists</A> bring these points home. This letter implicitly supports my argument that some opposition to GMOs doesn’t reflect ignorance about the benefit but rather self-interest of various groups. It is ironic that the potential of transgenics to contribute to adaptation to <mark>climate change</mark> has been <A href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12765/full"">ignored by the IPCC, which I believe reflects political economic considerations</A>.</P><P> </P><P>If self-interest plays an important role in the denial of <mark>climate change</mark> and opposition to GMOs, what can we do about it? First, we shouldn’t give up on the power of persuasion and information. We need to continue research documenting the likelihood and impact of <mark>climate change</mark>, and the benefits of GMOs and the costs of opposing it. The technology needs to be delinked from Monsanto and other companies. While they possess intellectual property rights on certain varieties and technical knowhow, they do not own this plant breeding technology. <A href=""http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v21/n9/full/nbt0903-989.html?foxtrotcallback=true"">It is part of the shared human knowledge</A>. Many politicians and people are on the fence about it, and might respond to additional information, which will affect the debate. It may be useful to connect real-world phenomenon to <mark>climate change</mark> and biotechnology delicately. For example, the strength and frequency of recent hurricanes may give people who oppose taking action against <mark>climate change</mark> to realize the cost of this strategy. Second, we need to recognize some of the reasons for the objection and accommodate them in developing policies. I am a big believer in <mark>carbon</mark> taxes to reduce GHG emissions. But once they are introduced, some of the proceeds should address coping with higher energy prices, especially by the poor. Transition from one form of energy to another may be associated with transfers that make the adjustment easier. In the case of biotechnology, developing and introducing traits that address major social concerns and clearly benefit consumers and the poor will make the technology more appealing.</P><P> </P><P>I am not deluding myself, the denial of <mark>climate change</mark> and resistance to biotechnology will continue and society will pay the price. Our challenge is to develop research and educational efforts that will lead to faster change of mind, and better policies.</P><P> </P></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The co-chair of the sessions was Professor Angelo Moretto, a board member of ILSI’s Health and Environmental Services Institute, and of its Risk21 steering group too, which Boobis also co-chairs.  In 2012, the ILSI group took a $500,000 donation from Monsanto and a $528,500 donation from the industry group Croplife International, which represents  Monsanto, Dow, Syngenta and others, according to documents obtained by the US right to know campaign.

Bayer is embroiled in controversy over its neonicotinoid insecticides because, as systemic pesticides, they move through the entire plant and express the poison through pollen and nectar, indiscriminately killing bees and other pollinators and polluting waterways. Flubendiamide, a benzenedicarboxamide pesticide, is “locally systemic” within the plant’s leaves. EPA’s action today may take years of regulatory review and legal action while the pesticide remains on the market. EPA used the controversial conditional registration provision of federal pesticide law, when in 2008 it allowed flubendiamide on the market, despite outstanding environmental data. At the time, it struck an agreement that, if unreasonable adverse effects on the environment were found, Bayer would withdraw the chemical’s registration. Today’s action serves to exemplify the consequences of allowing potentially harmful substances onto the market without all the information necessary to issue a complete finding of environmental and public safety.

The reality is clear: new technologies must be developed so farmers can become even more efficient and more <mark>sustainable</mark> on their current farms, to meet the demands of a growing global population. New technologies and breakthrough <mark>innovation</mark>s will revolutionize farming and ensure customized solutions for growers, large and small, so that they can produce more food with less land and fewer resources. These possibilities excite us as a company, as we do our very best to work alongside farmers across the globe to truly shape the future of farming.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P> “By 2050, the world’s population is expected to increase to almost 10 billion. That’s more than two-and-a-half billion additional mouths we need to feed.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG>We hear often about the challenges posed to agriculture by the growing world population, or by <mark>climate change</mark>, for example. To what extent do you think agriculture needs to change to face these challenges over the next decade?</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Liam Condon:</STRONG> By 2050, the world’s population is expected to increase to almost 10 billion. That’s more than two-and-a-half billion additional mouths we need to feed. This colossal growth in people, combined with a lack of arable land and water shortages, means that food production will have to increase by 50 percent. At the same time, we know that <mark>climate change</mark> will place food crop yields under unprecedented pressure in the years to come. A fundamental transformation of today’s global food system is required, with <mark>innovation</mark>, visionary thinking and collaboration at the core. Investment in sound science, and the acceptance and use of innovative technologies will drive the changes we need to ensure resource-efficient, nutrient-dense food for all in the years to come.</P><P><STRONG>Can you give us some examples of the kinds of <mark>innovation</mark>s you mention, and how they will change the future of farming?</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Liam Condon:</STRONG> The GFIA showed that agricultural <mark>innovation</mark> takes many forms. We know that breakthrough <mark>innovation</mark> will come from our ability to harness and bring together new developments in biological, chemical and data sciences. At the same time, new players and start-ups are bringing fresh and innovative thinking to the industry that will help deliver powerful new tools to growers, big and small. From sensors to field robots and smart irrigation systems, digital technology is allowing farmers to take advantage of the rich sources of data at their fingertips to boost profits and make agriculture more <mark>sustainable</mark>. We know that the project <A href=""https://iof2020.eu"" target=""_blank"">Internet for Food and Farm 2020</A> will pave the way for data-driven farming, autonomous operations, virtual food chains and personalized nutrition for European citizens. In this context, we support the European Commission’s approach to set common standards for data transmission and machine connectivity, and to accelerate the adoption of digital technologies to improve farm efficiency and sustainability.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“A fundamental transformation of today’s global food system is required, with <mark>innovation</mark>, visionary thinking and collaboration at the core.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Genome-editing technology is another example that is likely to deliver breakthroughs in plant breeding and will significantly improve the scale and discovery efficiency of new research that will advance global agriculture and, ultimately, result in more safe, nutritious and affordable food for consumers all over the world, produced in a more environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark> manner.</P><P><STRONG>What does Europe need to do to remain competitive in global agriculture?</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Liam Condon:</STRONG> Europe is a pivotal player in global food production and consumption. It is also home to many world-class research institutions and leading food and agriculture companies. Often called the ‘world’s breadbasket’, the European Union produces around 20 percent of the world’s wheat supply. But if European agriculture is to retain this important position into the future, we need a political environment that fosters <mark>innovation</mark> and collaboration along the broad and multilayered value chain. Suppliers, producers, governments, NGOs, and investors all have an important part to play in ensuring we bring to market the necessary <mark>innovation</mark>s needed to feed our growing population.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“While I am optimistic about our basic capability to feed the world sustainably, I am concerned about societal acceptance of <mark>innovation</mark>.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>And this brings me to public perception. You would think that consumers in developed nations would have a deep appreciation for the abundance and quality of food we enjoy. Unfortunately, this is not really the case. While I am optimistic about our basic capability to feed the world sustainably, I am concerned about societal acceptance of <mark>innovation</mark> and the growing disconnect between those who produce our food and those who consume it.

The South would be hit the hardest.</P><P>A different set of studies looked at the health of bees in connection to insecticides used in crops. Bees are critical for our global food production. Honeybees alone are responsible for pollinating $15 billion of U.S. crops.</P><P>The new papers demonstrated the popular insecticide used in agriculture called neonicotinoids can be harmful to bees.</P><P>Miles O’Brien is with us again.</P><P>Miles, we have been looking at or scientists have been thinking about the chemicals that are used in insecticides as kind of one of the number one culprits for colony collapse for a long time.</P><P>So, what is so new about these studies?</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>MILES O’BRIEN:</STRONG></P><P> Well, you’re right, Hari. There have been a lot of studies in the past looking at bees and these insecticides, which are coated on the seeds and absorbed — they call it systemic to the plants.</P><P>They have been widely used for a decade, an alternative to spraying insecticides on the plant as they grow. The concern is that they can harm pollinators. But, so far, that’s only been a theory in the lab.</P><P>Separate teams in Europe and Canada tested the possible link between these neonics and bee losses in the field for the first time. They placed bee colonies close to crops that had been treated with the neonicotinoids and other colonies far away from agriculture.</P><P>They sampled a variety of specimens, pollen, nectar, larvae, bees themselves, of course. And they say the insecticide is not only found in the crops they are meant to protect, but it spreads to other plants in the area that are attracted to bees, and it persists for months.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>HARI SREENIVASAN:</STRONG></P><P> So, how does it affect the bees, and what happens to the whole colony?</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>MILES O’BRIEN:</STRONG></P><P> That’s the key question, connecting those dots.</P><P>Researchers at York University in Ontario did a second test in the laboratory mimicking what they found in the field. And they exposed bees to a small amount of the neonicotinoids-infused pollen. And those bees stopped — get this — maintaining the hygiene of their hive.</P><P>Typically, bees will remove sick or dead bees. But the insecticide-exposed bees for some reason stopped doing this, leaving sick bees inside the hive. And the beehive became a pigsty, if you will.</P><P>I caught up with Nadejda Tsvetkov, one of the lead authors of the York University study.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>NADEJDA TSVETKOV, York University:</STRONG></P><P> What we found in our study was that worker bees from exposed colonies die 23 percent sooner, so that’s a very big hit to the colony.</P><P>They also had abnormal foraging behaviors. We found also that the colonies had difficulty replacing a queen. So, over time, we had more and more queenless colonies, which, unless there is an intervention, the colonies will perish.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person vt__person--host""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>MILES O’BRIEN:</STRONG></P><P> At first blush, this study seems to put to rest the neonic collapse debate.</P><P>But, in a separate study also published last week, a European team found some bee colonies in Germany that thrived even though they were close to fields with neonic-treated crops.</P><P>This led researchers to believe there must be other geographical or environmental factor in play. Maybe some bees are more susceptible to the toxins, depending on their locations, for example.</P><P>In short, the studies suggests the effects of neonics on bees are inconsistent. But that study was funded in part by the German chemical and pharmaceutical giant Bayer, which happens to be the maker of neonicotinoids.</P><P>Now, in a statement, Bayer says it remains convinced that neonicotinoid seed treatments have no short- or long-term negative effects on bees, and that these seed treatments are useful and effective tool for farmers.</P></DIV></LI><LI class=""vt__person ""><DIV class=""vt__body body-text""><P><STRONG>HARI SREENIVASAN:</STRONG></P><P> In the totally different category of <mark>climate</mark> science, there was a big study this week.</P><P>And, usually, when <mark>climate</mark> studies come out, we’re looking at environmental impacts.

The reputation of transgenic crops has tanked, as what was once a harbinger of green technology is now commonly perceived as a source of genetic <mark>pollution</mark> and has thus become anathema for many environmentalists.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text text-6 parbase section""><P>The GMO story has become mired in the eco-wrecking narrative of industrial agriculture, and that is too bad for those who understand the real risks of <mark>climate change</mark> and discern our desperate need for <mark>innovation</mark>. And while the blue-sky hype of a genetically secured food supply has not become a reality, there have been a few breakthroughs. Even as <mark>climate change</mark> has increased the <A href=""http://chge.med.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/resources/agriculture<mark>climate</mark>.pdf"">prevalence of many plant diseases</A>, the new science can take credit for genetic inoculations that <A href=""http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2012/06/05/rainbow-papayas-first-gm-fruit-to-resist-virus-now-on-sale-in-japan/"">saved Hawaii’s papaya business</A>.

As David Zilbermans, professor of agriculture and resource economics at the University of California–Berkeley has <A href=""http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2012/06/06/why-labeling-of-gmos-is-actually-bad-for-people-and-the-environment/comment-page-1/"">noted</A>, “Adoption of herbicide tolerant varieties enabled transition to minimal tillage techniques, which reduced the greenhouse gas effect of agriculture equivalent to hundreds of thousands of cars annually.

And if Monsanto is the Microsoft of food supply—raking in the rent on bites instead of bytes—perhaps the time has come for the agricultural equivalent of Linux, the open-source operating system that made computer programming a communal effort.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text-11 text parbase section""><P>Open-source GMO is a new idea for food justice activists, who have been concentrating their efforts on depleting Monsanto's market share through consumer advocacy and political reform. Labeling laws for genetically modified organisms in the retail foodstream are <A href=""http://www.portlanddailysun.me/index.php/newsx/local-news/9198-crowd-at-capitol-pushes-for-gmo-labeling-of-foods"">about</A> to <A href=""http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2013/04/26/news/doc517b49540729e946247291.txt"">land</A> in <A href=""http://www.kjonline.com/news/if-food-modified-does-it-need-to-be-on-label__2013-04-24.html"">statehouses</A><A href=""http://www.vpirg.org/gmo/"">across</A><A href=""http://marighttoknow.com/home/legislative-support/ma-legislation/"">the country</A>.

For the surest way to sabotage Monsanto is not to label  but to sap its income. Already, a number of biotech pioneers have followed the open-source examples of Apache and Wikipedia. The database of the human genome mapping project has been free since it was published in 2003. The genetic map of rice has been made available at no charge to researchers worldwide. And the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has made its “Access to Global Online Research in Agriculture” a transnational paradigm of free-flowing information. Agricultural researchers in developing countries need not pay a penny to review all the latest life science research published in more than 3,000 academic journals.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text-13 text parbase section""><P>Like open-source software, open-source food genetics would advance biological research in this country, and our universities would soon become hothouses of <mark>innovation</mark>. Intellectual production without intellectual property would thrive, as scientists gained access to DNA code in all its infinite variety, along with the freedom to create derivative work and redistribute findings. No great leap of faith would be required, as open-source is one of food’s oldest dynamics. There’s no patent on a roast chicken, and the derivative work of Momofuku founder David Chang does not owe a fee to Marcella Hazan, Julia Child, or Colonel Sanders. Chefs and their recipes have long constituted a creative commons.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text text-14 parbase section""><P>Of course, even open source can be subverted. As intellectual property rights expert Séverine Dusollier observed two years after the <A href=""http://works.bepress.com/severine_dusollier"">genetic sequence of rice became public</A>, “The rice genome project placed masses of information into the public domain, most of which enabled private companies to develop applications such as genetic markers, specific genotypes related to nutrition, new quality of fibers, or targets for herbicides for which they filed a patent application.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""text text-15 parbase section""><P>Turns out that permissiveness requires police and plenty of lawyers. Which is why the so-called “patent left” and “copyleft” movements have created clever licensing agreements that infect any and all derivative products, thereby enforcing the free availability of <mark>innovation</mark>s going forward. Open-source agriculture joined the patent left movement when Cambia Technologies, an Australian biotech company that researches and develops GMOs, <A href=""http://www.bios.net/daisy/bios/home.html"">offered a licensing agreement</A> called BIOS, which allows for the free use of a technology called “transbacter.” Transbacter can be deployed to alter plant genetics, and its aim is not one specific modification for one specific corporate interest but to enable a slew of <mark>innovation</mark>s.</P></DIV><DIV class=""tablet-ad""><SPAN class=""adv""> Advertisement </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-16 section""><P>But BIOS, like all the other open-source initiatives, is far from perfect, as it creates the paradox of endlessly replicating armies of anti-licensing licenses. The way out of the logical mire—and the way to marshal agri-tech to the cause of <mark>climate change</mark>—is an explicit exception in the licensing law, an intellectual property loophole for food.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-17 section""><P>Everyone interested in global food knows that agriculture has had a largely negative impact on global warming, but few have recognized that legal reform of food-related intellectual property laws can help ensure a path to a more ecologically secure future. No doubt, biological “input” is far more complex than computer “input,” but the idea of a swarm of bio-hackers bringing down Monsanto and Dow is too delightful to dismiss. Throw <mark>climate change</mark> into the picture, and the stakes are simply too high for continuing the status quo of patented food. Neither information nor lunch may want to be free, but eventually we will need to get around to the business of sequencing proteins that have less to do with quarterly profits and more to do with centuries of ecological abuse. And those will be the only inputs that matter when the big heat hits.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Our aim was to discuss the findings and implications of emerging research on <mark>climate change</mark>. As I recall there was not yet a consensus among meteorologists and other scientists about interpreting observed changes, but by the early 1990s most scientists accepted that humans contributed significantly to global warming, and importantly, that it is a major risk to humanity and that it requires a managed, political response.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400""> This emerging consensus resulted in the UN Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> in 1992, which led to the Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997 and signed by many nations, including the US in 1998 under Clinton but not ratified by the Senate. I was part of a White House taskforce that initiated research and education efforts that attempted to lead to ratification by the US senate. We organized workshops in Washington and elsewhere, met with staffers, legislators, lobbyists, and experts. Through these, I realized that representatives opposed Kyoto not because they didn’t believe in <mark>climate change</mark>, but because it is against the immediate self-interest of their voters. Most representatives and staffers recognized the key point that <mark>climate change</mark> poses risks to society but they felt that their constituents would not want to pay the price of mitigation. Furthermore, for representatives from some regions (e.g. the Dakotas) global warming seems like <mark>climate</mark> improvement. A key feature of the Kyoto Protocol was that developed countries would reduce emissions since they contribute a greater share to GHG emissions and subsidize reductions by developing countries (they still need to grow).</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">I knew of very few scientists that were skeptics (their number has declined over time), and some people denied <mark>climate change</mark> because of religious beliefs. One strategic approach of politicians who didn’t want the US and developed countries to pay the lion’s share of mitigation was to assume the role of skeptics, or even deniers of <mark>climate change</mark>. But my impression is that many of the deniers are not ignorant and do believe in science, but they do not want to pay. Someone once summarized it as “they are not stupid they are mean.”  I would not go that far though – they are driven by short term self-interest. This is not a unique situation. For example, in retrospect we have found that much of the denial of the health effects of cigarettes by tobacco companies used the same logic.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">My interpretation of some of the resistance to GMOs is similar. I was introduced to agricultural biotechnology in the late 1980s, as some of the early researchers were on campus and I knew some of them. I worked on pesticides and realized that chemical pesticides provide significant value but are costly both economically and environmentally. Development of new crop varieties, by various means (including use of radiation to generate mutations) has been an effective way to develop pest and disease control. I knew that some of the developers of new pest controlling traits aimed to reduce or replace chemical pesticides and even expand the tools of organic agriculture. They also have other goals, such as reducing dependence on fertilizers (i.e., by enhancing nitrogen fixation), improving nutritional content of food, etc. I appreciate that biotechnology relies on basic understandings of processes inside the plant. I expect, as many others, that this knowledge and its applications will improve over time as we will have more knowledge and improved tools which will lead to more <mark>sustainable</mark> diverse and efficient agriculture, allowing to improve human well-being and environmental health.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">However, understandable and exaggerated concern by activists has led to excessive and costly regulations that gave major companies like Monsanto an edge in developing new products. Companies that were threatened by new biotechnology products lobbied against it. I recall that in a hearing of the </SPAN><A href=""https://www.nap.edu/catalog/9598/the-future-role-of-pesticides-in-us-agriculture"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow external noreferrer"" data-wpel-link=""external""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">NRC committee on the future of pesticides</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">, a presentation by a Bayer official stated that GMOs have limited potential to solve pesticide problems and they recommended larger investments in chemical pesticides. It is ironic because now Bayer is acquiring Monsanto, with its relative advantage in agricultural biotechnology. Herbicide manufacturers, like the American Cyanamid Company, were affected negatively by RoundUp Ready varieties. Most of the chemical companies that were negatively affected by biotechnology were European, and Monsanto, who kept tight control of IPR, was American, and that was one of the self-interest drivers to European opposition to biotechnology. And I suspect that it even led to implicit partnerships between environmental groups and companies. There are many other political economic reasons for </SPAN><A href=""http://agbioforum.org/v12n1/v12n1a04-graff.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow external noreferrer"" data-wpel-link=""external""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">opposing GMOs</SPAN></A><A href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/gmcr.26981"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow external noreferrer"" data-wpel-link=""external""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">in Europe</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">. The negative attitude towards GMOs spilled over to some of the public and increased the political power of the opposition. They also realized that by picketing near retailers, they could reduce the spread of the technology. This led to severe restriction on the use of GMOs in Europe, and utilization of the technology around the world. Even worse, it led to heavy restriction of the use of GMOs in developing countries, </SPAN><A href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181353"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow external noreferrer"" data-wpel-link=""external""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">contributing to malnutrition in Africa</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400""> and </SPAN><A href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environment-and-development-economics/article/economic-power-of-the-golden-rice-opposition/F31EE0E5B6044B86B5223FF20C409158"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow external noreferrer"" data-wpel-link=""external""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">blindness in South Asia</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">, among other problems.

This letter implicitly supports my argument that some opposition to GMOs doesn’t reflect ignorance about the benefit but rather self-interest of various groups. It is ironic that the potential of transgenics to contribute to adaptation to <mark>climate change</mark> has been </SPAN><A href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12765/full"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow external noreferrer"" data-wpel-link=""external""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">ignored by the IPCC, which I believe reflects political economic considerations</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">If self-interest plays an important role in the denial of <mark>climate change</mark> and opposition to GMOs, what can we do about it? First, we shouldn’t give up on the power of persuasion and information. We need to continue research documenting the likelihood and impact of <mark>climate change</mark>, and the benefits of GMOs and the costs of opposing it. The technology needs to be delinked from Monsanto and other companies. While they possess intellectual property rights on certain varieties and technical knowhow, they do not own this plant breeding technology. </SPAN><A href=""https://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v21/n9/full/nbt0903-989.html?foxtrotcallback=true"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow external noreferrer"" data-wpel-link=""external""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">It is part of the shared human knowledge</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">. Many politicians and people are on the fence about it, and might respond to additional information, which will affect the debate. It may be useful to connect real-world phenomenon to <mark>climate change</mark> and biotechnology delicately. For example, the strength and frequency of recent hurricanes may give people who oppose taking action against <mark>climate change</mark> to realize the cost of this strategy. Second, we need to recognize some of the reasons for the objection and accommodate them in developing policies. I am a big believer in <mark>carbon</mark> taxes to reduce GHG emissions. But once they are introduced, some of the proceeds should address coping with higher energy prices, especially by the poor. Transition from one form of energy to another may be associated with transfers that make the adjustment easier. In the case of biotechnology, developing and introducing traits that address major social concerns and clearly benefit consumers and the poor will make the technology more appealing.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400"">I am not deluding myself, the denial of <mark>climate change</mark> and resistance to biotechnology will continue and society will pay the price. Our challenge is to develop research and educational efforts that will lead to faster change of mind, and better policies.</SPAN></P><P><B>David Zilberman is Professor David Zilberman holds the Robinson Chair in the Department of Agriculture and Resource Economics at UC Berkeley, where he has been a faculty member since 1979.

At the moment, there are large amounts of traffic on urban streets that create an increase in air <mark>pollution</mark> and loud noise. From our conversations with city officials, we’ve learned that future mobility services can only be successful if they can efficiently connect public transport and individual mobility.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">We presented our conception of future mobility during BMW’s 100 year anniversary with the BMW VISION NEXT concept cars. The car of the future is autonomous, connected, electric, <mark>sustainable</mark>, and, if desired, shareable between multiple clients. We see trends toward these developments in “Automated,”“Connected, “Electrified,” and “Shared”– ACES for short.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">In coming years, we will witness the automobile change more rapidly and substantially than ever before.

Our innovative vehicles and services are the primary method to achieve this.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Additionally, the BMW Group has founded a research center for urban mobility, with comprised of a variety of experts from different fields. The joint task of the team is to engage with leaders of big cities and analyze their needs. This is at the prerequisite for developing new urban mobility solutions together with cities.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>What do you see as the barriers to achieving large scale <mark>sustainable</mark> urban mobility?</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">There are currently big differences in how electro-mobility is being promoted in different countries and cities. Positive examples, like Norway, show what can be achieved with a proactive effort – one in three new cars is electric. Unfortunately, there is a lack of adequate electric vehicle charging infrastructure in many cities worldwide. This can scare away potential customers, who would otherwise want to make the switch to environmentally-friendly electro-mobility.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>What are the key <mark>innovation</mark>s and solutions that BMW are bringing to the <mark>climate change</mark> effort?</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">In our view, it is crucial to adopt a comprehensive approach to combatting <mark>climate change</mark> as business. Within the framework of our ten sustainability goals, we have targets for our products, services, production, and supply chain. In this way, we want to significantly reduce the <mark>CO2</mark> emissions of our vehicles, be a leading provider of electro-mobility, and permanently change mobility behaviour in cities.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">At the same time, we are continuing to pursue our goal of further reducing <mark>CO2</mark> emissions at our production facilities. We are increasing the energy efficiency of our facilities and are investing in renewable energy. Our vision is to ultimately have a completely emissions-free production process. To achieve this, we increased the share of renewable energy in our purchased energy mix to 63%. We built wind turbines at our Leipzig plant, where we build our BMW i vehicles. Our Oxford plant is relying on solar energy, while our Rosslyn, South Africa plant uses biogas. In the US we use energy sources such as hydropower as well as methane gas. There are countless examples of how we are achieving our energy goal step by step.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>How does your involvement with Formula E support your BMWi/urban mobility offering?</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">While de<mark>carbon</mark>ization is the key theme of our industry, the BMW Group has a strong athletic identity in its brand and production. Our dynamic identity has always made our products stand out. Given the air quality needs of large cities, Formel E offers an interesting approach to combining racing and <mark>sustainable</mark> mobility.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>Why does BMW continue to be involved with the <mark>Sustainable</mark> <mark>Innovation</mark> Forum?</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">The BMW Group’s commitment to the <mark>Sustainable</mark> <mark>Innovation</mark> Forum is a unique tradition, and for good reason. <mark>Sustainable</mark> management is part of our corporate strategy. We have a holistic approach to sustainability across our entire value chain. At the same time, we are aware for that many goals can only be achieved in cooperation with partners and stakeholders. That’s why we are taking part in an exchange of ideas and information with other stakeholders as part of this global dialogue.

Other varieties which have added resistance against so called HPPD herbicides are to follow at a later date. </P><P>Dirk Zimmermann of Greenpeace criticised the launch, saying after the failure of glyphosate tolerant plants, Bayer is now ramping up pesticide production. Having joined the arms race of global GM soy cultivation, the corporation has outed itself as an irresponsible war profiteer.</P><P>The introduction of further GMO plants with a host of new herbicide resistances has unmasked the whole concept as a one way street serving only as a vehicle to sell more and more toxic agrochemicals.</P><P>Forests, fallow land and small-scale farms in South America have been displaced by massive soy plantations. The crop is not used to feed the local population but instead is largely exported to Europe and the USA, due to the huge demand by the meat industry. On the other hand, production of staple foods is being undermined by the soy boom. High meat consumption is causing major ecological and health damage in South America. </P><P>Toxic herbicides such as glyphosate and glufosinate must be banned. Glyphosate and glufosinate are sold in combination with genetically modified seed, particularly soy and maize. Since the seed market is controlled by just a handful of corporations, many farmers are only able to buy GMO seed. </P><P>Glyphosate (‘Roundup’), developed by Monsanto, is the top-selling agrotoxin worldwide. As the patent has expired, the active ingredient is now also sold by Bayer and other companies. Glyphosate is suspected of causing birth defects, damaging the DNA and promoting diseases including Alzheimer’s, diabetes and cancer. </P><P>Glufosinate is even more toxic. A European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluation states that the substance poses a high risk to mammals. Glufosinate is classified as reprotoxic, with laboratory experiments causing premature birth, intra-uterine death and abortions in rats. That is why the substance must be withdrawn from sale in the EU by 2017 at the latest. This has not prevented BAYER from announcing in May 2013 that it would build a huge new glufosinate factory in the USA. In this way the corporation seeks to close the gap caused by the increasing inefficacy of glyphosate against weeds. </P><P>GM crops do not solve the hunger problem, contrary to the claims repeatedly made by lobbyists. About 80 percent of GM crops are used as animal feed. GM crops are neither drought-resistant nor more high-yielding. Their cultivation on ever larger areas is pushing back the production of food crops, making it more difficult to feed local populations. </P><P>With a global market share of 20% BAYER is the second largest pesticide manufacturer. The corporation’s products are responsible for a significant proportion of pesticide poisoning worldwide. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that up to 20 million cases of pesticide poisoning occur annually, of which up to 200,000 cases end in death. </P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
