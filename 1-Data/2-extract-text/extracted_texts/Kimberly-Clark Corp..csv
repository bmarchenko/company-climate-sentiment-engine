One of them, tall and beefy with a crew cut, walked up to her front door.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a6-af02-4610-b4db1aab6096"">&quot;The guy said, 'Is Joshua Martin home?' and I said, 'No, who are you?&quot; recalled Kelly. &quot;He said, 'I'm with a company that's talking to current and former employees of ForestEthics, and I'm wondering if he still works there'.&quot;</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a6-af02-4610-b4db1aab6096"">Joshua had left ForestEthics, renamed Stand last year, to run the Environmental Paper Network. Kelly asked to see the stranger's ID and to snap a picture on her phone. Instead, the man retreated to the SUV and &quot;they literally peeled out of the driveway.&quot;</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a6-af02-4610-b4db1aab6096"">Around the same time, Aaron Sanger, another former employee of Stand, also received a visit from two men asking similar questions. So did others, some of them former employees of Greenpeace.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a6-af02-4610-b4db1aab6096"">Then, on the last day of that month, Greenpeace and Stand were hit with an unusual lawsuit brought by Resolute Forest Products, one of Canada's largest logging and paper companies, that could cost the groups hundreds of millions of dollars if Resolute wins.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a6-af02-4610-b4db1aab6096"">The timber company said the organizations, which for years had campaigned against Resolute's logging in Canada's boreal forest, were conspiring illegally to extort the company's customers and defraud their own donors.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a6-af02-4610-b4db1aab6096"">Invoking the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, a federal conspiracy law devised to ensnare mobsters, the suit accuses the organizations, as well as several green campaigners individually and numerous unidentified &quot;co-conspirators,&quot; of running what amounts to a giant racket.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a7-9681-aa44-8f26ea152b62"">&quot;Maximizing donations, not saving the environment, is Greenpeace's true objective,&quot; </SPAN><A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3229327-Complaint.html#document/p2/a379916"">the complaint says</A>. &quot;Its campaigns are consistently based on sensational misinformation untethered to facts or science, but crafted instead to induce strong emotions and, thereby, donations.&quot; Dozens of the group's campaign emails and tweets, it said, <A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3229327-Complaint.html#document/p97/a379918"">constituted wire fraud</A>.</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a7-9681-aa44-8f26ea152b62"">&quot;As an NGO, that is a deeply chilling argument,&quot; said Carroll Muffett, president of the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), which joined eight other groups to file </SPAN><A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3892237-AmicusBriefAdvocacyGroups.html"">an <EM>amici curiae</EM> brief</A> supporting a move to dismiss Resolute's case.</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a7-9681-aa44-8f26ea152b62"">The far-reaching lawsuit has seized attention across the environmental advocacy and legal communities. Arguments are to be heard in court next week.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""> </P><P dir=""ltr""> </P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a7-9681-aa44-8f26ea152b62"">The Resolute lawsuit was unprecedented. Then several months ago, former employees of Greenpeace and the environmental advocacy group 350.org were similarly visited by investigators. In August, the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline </SPAN><A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3943765-Energy-Transfer-Complaint.html"">filed a separate RICO suit</A> against Greenpeace and two smaller groups, Banktrack and Earth First!. The complaint echoes Resolute's claims: a broad conspiracy against a major company, advocacy groups running an illegal &quot;enterprise&quot; to further their own interests while damaging the company, Energy Transfer Partners. It even alleges support for eco-terrorism, a violation of the Patriot Act, and drug trafficking.</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a7-9681-aa44-8f26ea152b62"">It was filed by the same lawyer who represents Resolute—Michael J. Bowe, of the firm Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, who is also a member of President Donald Trump's personal legal team.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a7-fbc6-dc50-73e65bed7086"">&quot;The Energy Transfer Partners lawsuit against Greenpeace is perhaps the most aggressive SLAPP-type suit that I've ever seen,&quot; said Michael Gerrard, faculty director of the Sabin Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Law at Columbia University, using the acronym for a lawsuit that aims to silence political advocacy. &quot;The paper practically bursts into flames in your hands.&quot;</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN>While the second lawsuit names only three defendants, together with unnamed &quot;co-conspirators,&quot; it also accuses many of the nation's leading environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, Earthjustice and 350.org, of participating in a sprawling enterprise to disrupt business and defraud donors.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a7-fbc6-dc50-73e65bed7086"">&quot;This was precisely what we were concerned we would see,&quot; said Muffett of CIEL. Dozens of organizations, American Indian tribes and countless individuals were involved in the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline. By naming a handful of them and unnamed co-conspirators, the suit may cause anyone with any ties to the movement to think twice before sending the next campaign email or launching a new effort, Muffett said.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a7-fbc6-dc50-73e65bed7086"">&quot;Those groups will be looking at this and trying to decide on how to respond and what it means for their campaigns going forward, not only on Dakota Access but other campaigns as well. And that is, in all likelihood, a core strategy of a case like this.&quot;</SPAN></P><H3 dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-875b9152-e83a-cec0-252d-2681a8dba8b6"">A Powerful Message</SPAN></H3><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a8-7cad-730c-a077c29cc8d8"">Kasowitz Benson Torres has earned a reputation as a particularly brash New York law firm. The waiting room of its Manhattan offices displays a brochure of media mentions, including several about the firm's close relationship with Trump. When Timothy O'Brien reported in his 2005 book, &quot;TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald,&quot; that the future president was worth between $150 million and $250 million, not the billions he boasted, Trump hired Kasowitz to sue O'Brien for $5 billion. </SPAN><A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/when-trump-goes-looking-for-a-media-brawl-this-feared-lawyer-steps-in/2016/10/16/f6dbc486-9181-11e6-9c85-ac42097b8cc0_story.html"">The case</A> dragged on for five years before being dismissed.</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a8-7cad-730c-a077c29cc8d8"">It may have been the firm's work for a Canadian insurance company, however, that captured the attention of Resolute.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a8-7cad-730c-a077c29cc8d8"">In 2006, Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited hired Bowe and Kasowitz to sue several hedge funds, accusing them of operating a criminal enterprise to drive down the company's share price and boost their short-sale profits. The case relied on New Jersey's RICO statute, and while it was dismissed in 2012, Fairfax appealed and in April </SPAN><A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fairfax-fin-hedgefunds/steven-cohen-sac-must-again-face-fairfax-short-selling-lawsuit-idUSKBN17T2N9"">won a ruling</A> saying it could proceed with some of its claims. Bradley Martin, Fairfax's vice president of strategic investments, is chairman of Resolute's board of directors.</P><DIV class=""media media-element-container media-image_right_medium""><FIGURE id=""file-269298"" itemscope=""itemscope"" itemtype=""http://schema.org/ImageObject"" class=""file file-image file-image-jpeg with-caption""><FIGCAPTION class=""field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text-long field-label-hidden""><DIV class=""field-items""><P>Attorney Michael Bowe represents Resolute Forest Products and Energy Transfer Partners.

In fact, sometimes plaintiffs who don't have substantial damages sue primarily to clear their reputations,&quot; he said. Behind Bowe's desk hangs an American flag from the battle of Fallujah, among the bloodiest of the Iraq War. &quot;I think the filing of a suit in court sends the most credible message that what they're saying about you is not true.&quot;</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a8-d2e4-3c57-71668eae6df4"">The Resolute case has its origins in a long-running environmental campaign focusing on Canada's boreal forest, a thick green stripe across much of the country. It's one of the world's largest stores of <mark>carbon</mark>, and environmental groups say it's under increasing pressure from logging operations. In 2012, Greenpeace Canada released a report purporting to show that Resolute was operating in parts of the forest it had agreed to stay out of. It turned out, however, that the area in question was not part of the protected forest. Greenpeace later </SPAN><A href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/03/20/greenpeace-canada-resolute-retraction_n_2917122.html"">issued an apology and said it would</A> retract any material that drew on the assessment.</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a8-d2e4-3c57-71668eae6df4"">There's some disagreement on whether Resolute's logging practices stand out from its peers—many environmentalists say they do, but some people familiar with its work dismiss the claim. What everyone interviewed for this article agreed on is that unlike many of its peers, Resolute has resisted settling with environmentalists. In 2013, it sued Greenpeace Canada in an ongoing Canadian defamation suit over the boreal campaign. And after Greenpeace continued its work, and targeted many of Resolute's American customers, Resolute eventually filed its U.S. RICO claim, targeting the organization's U.S. and international arms, as well.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a8-d2e4-3c57-71668eae6df4"">In 124 pages of detailed and passionate language, </SPAN><A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3229327-Complaint.html"">the complaint</A> alleges not only that the defendants lied in order to harm Resolute's business, but that their primary objective is not to protect the environment but to raise money. It describes a &quot;<A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3229327-Complaint.html#document/p78/a379937"">blitzkrieg attack</A>&quot; of threats against the company's customers unless they dropped Resolute. Some, like Kimberly-Clark, UPM, Best Buy and News Corp have either ended contracts or requested the contracts be altered to alleviate concerns, according to the complaint.</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a8-d2e4-3c57-71668eae6df4"">The lawsuit says the groups impersonated company employees to gain proprietary information and suggests Greenpeace was associated with a hack of the websites of Resolute and Best Buy. Beyond the 2012 error that Greenpeace retracted, the lawsuit says Greenpeace defamed the company by, among other things, calling it a &quot;forest destroyer.&quot; In addition to Greenpeace and Stand, the lawsuit names several of the organizations' employees personally as defendants. The co-conspirators—or John and Jane Does—it says, are people of unknown identity </SPAN><A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3229327-Complaint.html#document/p13/a379958"">who assisted Greenpeace's work</A>, including &quot;cyber-hacktivists, environmental activists, and certain foundations directing funds to the defendants.&quot; The suit seeks damages to be determined in a trial, but cites a claim by Greenpeace to have cost the company at least $80 million. RICO claims entitle plaintiffs to recover triple damages, in this case potentially more than $240 million.</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a8-d2e4-3c57-71668eae6df4"">On Oct. 10, Greenpeace will ask a federal judge in California to dismiss the case. The group submitted a similar motion last year in Georgia, where the suit was originally filed. The Georgia judge later moved the case to California, where two of the defendants are based, </SPAN><A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3864267-Order-Granting-Motion-to-Change-Venue.html#document/p7/a379962"">saying Resolute had not provided</A> any &quot;factual basis from which to infer that defendants committed fraud or extortion&quot; in Georgia. &quot;Rather, the allegations in the complaint, at best, support the inference that the defendants organized and held a protest in Augusta.&quot;</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9a8-d2e4-3c57-71668eae6df4"">&quot;It is very alarming that you can have plaintiffs like this, representing corporate interests attacking legitimate critics doing advocacy work by just drafting a complaint, throwing whatever in there, stretching racketeering law and going after constitutionally protected free speech by throwing labels out there basically trying to criminalize legitimate advocacy work,&quot; said Tom Wetterer, Greenpeace's general counsel.</SPAN></P><H3 dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-875b9152-e83a-cec0-252d-2681a8dba8b6"">Changing the Conversation</SPAN></H3><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9aa-cf30-3c93-42bdeb6be003"">Over the past year, several energy corporations have filed lawsuits against critics. Murray Energy Corp., an Ohio-based coal company, </SPAN><A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/public-editor/murray-energy-libel-suit.html?_r=1"">filed a libel claim</A> against The New York Times in May after it published an editorial critical of the company, and the following month <A href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/coal-king-sues-hbo-over-john-olivers-show?via=desktop&amp;source=copyurl"">filed another suit</A> against comedian John Oliver, HBO, Time Warner and some staff members of his show, &quot;Last Week Tonight.&quot; In August, Cabot Oil &amp; Gas Corp., which has been accused of polluting residential water wells in Pennsylvania, <A href=""http://wesa.fm/post/cabot-oil-files-5m-suit-against-pa-resident-lawyers#stream/0"">sued one of the residents</A> and his lawyers, saying they had harmed the company by filing a lawsuit, later withdrawn, that Cabot considered frivolous.

Many Peruvians, as well as diplomats at the talks, </SPAN><A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/10/peru-press-charges-greenpeace-nazca-lines-stunt"">were outraged by the stunt</A>, and the Peruvian government said the activists damaged the site.</P><P>Since its founding in 1971, Greenpeace has embraced this type of high-profile antics that self-consciously skirt the edges of legality and politesse. They also make Greenpeace the perfect boogeyman for conservatives and corporate leaders who have long pushed back against environmentalists, considering them out-of-touch radicals bent on crippling economic growth. (The Nazca Lines episode, for which Greenpeace later apologized, is listed in Resolute's complaint as evidence that the organization does more harm than good.)</P><P><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9ad-598b-64fb-1e92402a84be"">Greenpeace is international in reach, nipping at corporate heels no matter where they tread, and in recent decades it has become one of the most effective groups at pressing companies to reform. For any practice that Greenpeace wants changed—clearing Amazonian forests for soy or Indonesian ones for palm oil—the group searches the supply chain for a major consumer brand, asks it to change suppliers, and threatens to paint the brand as complicit in environmental pillage if it refuses.

It says they lied about the company's practices—claiming it hadn't consulted with Indian tribes and that the project hadn't received a thorough environmental review. (In December, the Obama administration </SPAN><A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/05122016/dakota-access-pipeline-dapl-army-corps-standing-rock-sioux-reservation"">ordered</A> a more comprehensive environmental review of alternative routes, but the Trump administration <A href=""http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/politics/dakota-access-pipeline-easement-granted/index.html"">later approved the pipeline</A> before the review was finished.)

Together with the Resolute suit, which names Stand, the cases go after much of this uncompromising wing of environmentalism.</P><P>&quot;An attack against Greenpeace and Stand, two groups that have been really at the forefront of corporate campaigns, is not just an attack on those groups but is an attack on the strategy that NGOs have used to really bring corporations back under control in terms of their social and environmental behavior,&quot; said Michael Marx, who runs CorpEthics, an environmental consulting firm that works with several of the named groups. The two complaints list other campaigns that Greenpeace has engaged in, including its work against genetically modified crops, Canada's tar sands and a campaign on <mark>sustainable</mark> fishing. &quot;If Resolute is successful in a case like this, they're basically taking away what's become what I think is the real driver in the social responsibility movement.&quot;</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9ad-598b-64fb-1e92402a84be"">The lawsuits make extraordinary claims, comparing the named environmental organizations to &quot;</SPAN><A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3943765-Energy-Transfer-Complaint.html#document/p26/a380035"">parasites</A>&quot; and a &quot;<A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3943765-Energy-Transfer-Complaint.html#document/p4/a5"">predatory pack preying on legitimate businesses</A>.&quot;</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9ad-598b-64fb-1e92402a84be"">Many legal experts and environmentalists say it's too soon to say whether the suits will pose a serious threat to the groups or to the advocacy community more broadly.

Paglia said the group has already lost support from one funder who was wary of being dragged into a lawsuit, accounting for about a quarter of the funding for its boreal campaign. &quot;If we weren't really aggressive in trying to control costs, in trying to maintain our focus on our campaigns and revenue, it would be very easy for this lawsuit to turn into not just harassment but a death threat.&quot;</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-08c9658a-e9ad-598b-64fb-1e92402a84be"">Greenpeace is much larger, with </SPAN><A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/greenpeace/2017/2016-Annual-Report.pdf"">nearly $400 million</A> in revenue from all its international branches last year. If it lost in court, the payout could be substantial. (Energy Transfer Partners didn't specify a figure, saying it had lost hundreds of millions.) But Tom Wetterer, Greenpeace's general counsel, said that's not the goal, or the danger, of the cases. &quot;I don't think it's really about the money,&quot; he said. &quot;I think they have to realize that their claims are not strong, that it's the process that they're really focused on, regardless of the end.

Norris</A>, who co-directs the <A href=""http://www.chgeharvard.org/category/corporate-sustainability-and-health-shine-0"">Sustainability and Health Initiative for NetPositive Enterprise (SHINE)</A>, based at the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.</P><P>“With the recent adoption of the UN <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals and the ratification of the Paris Agreement on <mark>climate change</mark>, the need for net positive approaches is more urgent than ever,” said BSR Senior Vice President <A href=""http://www.bsr.org/en/about/staff-bio/eric-olson"">Eric Olson</A>. “Business has a clear mandate to create <mark>sustainable</mark> technologies, products, and services that can help the world meet these goals.”</P><P>While the momentum around net positive is growing, there are currently no commonly accepted ways for companies to measure and report on net positive claims, and there’s a risk that companies will invest in redundant, fragmented, or misaligned approaches.</P><P>The Net Positive Project will fill that gap by developing practices and tools companies can use to quantify, assess, communicate, and enhance their positive impacts on society and the environment.</P><P>“The Net Positive Project will provide guidance to companies in continually reducing their negative impacts or footprints, and it will give them support and direction in taking a restorative, generative path that intentionally grows the positive impacts or handprints that they create,” said SHINE’s Norris. “It will also advance the movement as a whole by providing an approach that is fact-based, transparent, and collaborative.”</P><P> </P><P>During its first year, the Net Positive Project will focus on three main initiatives:</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Net Positive Principles:</STRONG> Expand, refine, and agree on defining principles and a theory of change for net positive.</LI><LI><STRONG>Net Positive Methodology: </STRONG>Build on existing work to advance a framework on how to scope, measure, and communicate net positive outcomes.</LI><LI><STRONG>Case Study Methodology: </STRONG>Advance a standardized approach for companies to develop case studies describing how products and services contribute to social and environmental progress.</LI></UL><P>“The Net Positive Project will create a race to the top by increasing companies’ sustainability ambition to have a positive impact on society and the environment,” said Forum for the Future CEO <A href=""https://www.forumforthefuture.org/siteusers/sally-uren"">Sally Uren</A>. “It will also help companies enhance their approach to <mark>innovation</mark> and strategy, brand and reputation, and relationships with stakeholders, while it increases sales and financial success.”                                                                      </P><P>Founding company members of the Net Positive Project are: Advanced Micro Devices Inc., AT&amp;T, Capgemini UK Plc., The Crown Estate, Dell Inc., Dow Chemical Company, Eaton Corporation Plc., Fetzer Vineyards, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Humanscale, Kimberly-Clark, Kingfisher Plc., Kohler Co., and Owens Corning.</P><P> </P><P>Here is what some company leaders have said about their participation in the Net Positive Project:</P><P><STRONG>Charlene Lake, Senior Vice President, Corporate Social Responsibility, and Chief Sustainability Officer,</STRONG><STRONG>AT&amp;T: </STRONG>“Our strategic platform, Connect to Good, represents our company’s vision of using the power of our network to build a better tomorrow. For example, we know that our technology can help customers reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. That’s why we’ve set a goal to enable <mark>carbon</mark> savings 10 times the footprint of our operations by 2025 by enhancing the efficiency of our network and delivering <mark>sustainable</mark> customer solutions. We’ll be working with the Net Positive Project and others to measure and meet this goal.”</P><P><STRONG>John Pflueger, Principal Environmental Strategist, Dell: </STRONG>“By combining their efforts to create the Net Positive Project, these organizations are creating a collaborative that will promote restorative efforts. We look forward to working with them and our peers to develop net positive into a meaningful and credible movement that drives social and environmental good.”</P><P><STRONG>Carl Eckersley, Social and Environmental Responsibility Director,</STRONG><STRONG> Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company:</STRONG> “Solving the world’s toughest environmental challenges requires solutions that contribute more value than they consume in resources. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s technology <mark>innovation</mark>s enable many of these solutions, and we are excited to partner with other thought leaders to identify new opportunities that accelerate efficiency.”</P><P><STRONG>Lisa Morden, Senior Director, Global Sustainability, Kimberly-Clark:</STRONG> “At Kimberly-Clark, we are continuously using the lens of sustainability to further our vision to deliver essentials for a better life. We see net positive as a way to do this, achieving business growth while having a positive and impactful role in the world. The Net Positive Project provides a collaborative means to fully understand, shape, and agree on what it means to be net positive.”</P><P> </P><P>The Net Positive Project integrates insights from ongoing efforts, including:</P><UL><LI>The Net Positive Group, convened by Forum for the Future, WWF, and The <mark>Climate</mark> Group, developed a set of 12 net positive principles and guidance on how to measure and communicate the concept. </LI><LI>BSR’s Center for Technology and Sustainability, a cross-sector initiative that brings together the users and developers of technology to jointly study sustainability impacts and scale solutions.</LI><LI>Greg Norris’s experience with Harvard’s SHINE initiative, which works collaboratively with members to advance methods for net positive assessment based on life-cycle assessments and handprinting, integrating impacts related to the environment, health, society, and well-being.</LI><LI> </LI></UL><P>To learn more about the Net Positive Project, visit <A href=""http://www.netpositiveproject.org/"">www.netpositiveproject.org</A>.

Our natural resources are under intense pressure as a billion more people enter the global middle class, demanding more of everything. Radical transparency is opening up company operations and supply chains to public scrutiny.</P><P>This is not some futuristic scenario or model to debate, but reality today. We've passed an economic tipping point. A weakening of the foundations of our planetary infrastructure is costing business dearly and putting our society at risk. The mega-challenges threaten our ability to run an expanding global economy and profoundly change &quot;business as usual.&quot; But they also offer unprecedented opportunities: multi-trillion-dollar markets are in play and the winners of this new game will profit mightily. </P><P>The way companies currently operate will not allow them to keep up with the current—and future—rate of change. They need to make the big pivot.</P><P>The Big Pivot provides ten crucial strategies for leaders and companies ready to move boldly forward and win in this new reality. With concrete advice and tactics, and new stories from companies like BT, Diageo, Dow, Ford, Nike, Unilever, Walmart, and many others, The Big Pivot will help you, and all of us, create more resilient businesses and a more prosperous world. This book is the blueprint to get you started now.</P><H2>Early Praise for The Big Pivot</H2><P>&quot;We've reached a tipping point. Our planet and our society are at risk. Business has a historic opportunity and a responsibility to lead the world down a more just, rich, and <mark>sustainable</mark> path—one that creates more value for companies, communities, and countries. But where should executives begin? Winston's The Big Pivot offers a radical new direction for business that also represents the most practical path forward. Hand this book to your nearest change agent to get started. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in the future of business and our world.&quot;<STRONG>− Paul Polman, CEO, Unilever</STRONG></P><P>&quot;Andrew Winston's The Big Pivot is the blinking red warning light on the dashboard for every CEO responsible for keeping an enterprise running in a world besieged by unprecedented environmental and social challenges and constraints. By focusing on what's most important—the long-term survival and prosperity of the customer—he lays out a road map for a major shift in consciousness and purpose for the private sector. In compelling, earnest language, he describes the 'new normal' of business, giving business leaders a way to formulate a game plan for long-term success by capitalizing on opportunities in the face of the ultimate disruptive change.&quot; <STRONG>−  David Crane, President and CEO, NRG Energy</STRONG></P><P>&quot;In The Big Pivot, Andrew Winston has identified issues for business that require more than just a minor change of behavior—these big challenges demand an urgent 'pivot' by business for our own survival. NGOs and government have urged change, but Winston knows from his work with big corporates that if business leaders change incentives and demand engagement throughout their value chains, pivots will happen. I hope CEOs and other business leaders step up and read this book and then own the drive for much better outcomes for their companies and the world.&quot; <STRONG>− Lauralee Martin, CEO, HCP</STRONG></P><P> &quot;Andrew Winston offers a unique perspective in the ocean of writers who focus on sustainability. Winston completely understands what drives environmental issues, but he also understands what can solve environmental issues—a focus on how companies can drive growth and <mark>innovation</mark> through sustainability. Winston's practical approach to the largest issues of our generation makes his a voice that's respected by the world's leaders in politics, NGOs, and business.&quot; <STRONG>− David Steiner, CEO, Waste Management</STRONG></P><P>&quot;The Big Pivot is Winston's most important and impactful work to date—better even than Green to Gold. It's a wake-up call for you, your boss, and whoever sits in the corner office. Winston gives us a uniquely useful take on strategy in a volatile world. The Big Pivot offers business a much-needed plan of action and links the actual impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> and other planet-scale pressures to business's bottom line. Capitalism is about to change for the better.&quot; <STRONG>
− L. Hunter Lovins, founder and President, Natural Capital Solutions; coauthor, The Way Out</STRONG></P><P>&quot;Andrew Winston's The Big Pivot provides thought-provoking perspectives into some of the biggest issues facing companies around the world. Increasingly, business leaders are realizing that 'business as usual' will not be enough to address the world's challenges. Winston issues a call to action in a time of radical change and competing priorities.&quot; <STRONG>
− Thomas J. Falk, Chairman and CEO, Kimberly-Clark</STRONG></P><P>&quot;A resounding call to action for business to embrace the risks of <mark>climate change</mark>, resource constraints, and radical transparency and turn them into strategic growth opportunities . . .a must-read road map for business success in the twenty-first century.&quot;  <STRONG>
− Jeff Seabright, Vice President, Environment &amp; Water Resources, Coca-Cola</STRONG></P><P>&quot;Andrew Winston zeroes in on the important issues we need to address in this century, while providing a guide to realistic tools and strategies that companies can use to tackle them. The Big Pivot distills many of the complexities and challenges in the business community and beyond, and it provides a thoughtful and informative analysis for all readers.&quot;   <STRONG>
− Jochen Zeitz, cofounder and Cochairman, The B Team; former CEO, PUMA </STRONG></P><P>&quot;Andrew Winston is a radical pragmatist. For anyone despairing that we can't move beyond incrementalism, here is an antidote. In The Big Pivot, Winston shows with guts and gusto how companies can address a hotter, scarcer, and more open world—and thrive.&quot; <STRONG>
− Malini Mehra, founder, Centre for Social Markets (India)</STRONG></P><P>&quot;The Big Pivot is a must-read for environmental and business professionals alike. Winston makes a compelling and logical case for why companies and leaders have a tremendous opportunity to drive transformative changes. The Big Pivot shows that the perception that radical equals risky is false. Non-action, more than action, is where the real risk lies. A compelling and fascinating read.&quot; <STRONG>
− Rob Bernard, Chief Environmental Strategist, Microsoft</STRONG></P><P>&quot;Winston powerfully articulates more than just the mega-trends impacting the dynamics of the new world order for business; he also provides an instructive guide to how business can not only survive but thrive in this new reality. The Big Pivot offers an invaluable blueprint for building a resilient company in the rapidly changing context of a planet in peril.&quot; <STRONG>
− John Replogle, President and CEO, Seventh Generation</STRONG></P><P>&quot;Once we burned heretics at the stake, but as we move further into the Big Pivot we must find, empower, and replicate the heretical innovators, entrepreneurs, investors, and policy makers now blazing trails to a more <mark>sustainable</mark> future. Andrew Winston serves as a modern Dante, guiding us through a seismically convulsed landscape of risk and opportunity.&quot; <STRONG>
− John Elkington, cofounder, Environmental Data Services, SustainAbility, and Volans; coauthor, The Power of Unreasonable People; and author, The Zeronauts</STRONG></P><P>&quot;All businesses today need smart sustainability strategies that make both economic and environmental sense. Those who make the 'pivot'—to incorporate natural resources into their bottom line—will thrive in a rapidly changing world. The Big Pivot shows the way.&quot; <STRONG>
− Mark Tercek, President and CEO, The Nature Conservancy; author, Nature's Fortune</STRONG></P><P>&quot;In the coming years, the fate of the planet and all species, including humans, will be decided. The threats are real, and all our global organizations—companies, governments, and nonprofits—will need to collaborate in new ways to solve the world's largest challenges. Andrew Winston's The Big Pivot is the right book for these challenging times, providing business and public-sector leaders a radical, yet practical, new plan for how business will need to operate.&quot; <STRONG>
 − Peter Seligmann, Chairman and CEO, Conservation International</STRONG></P><P>&quot;The science is clear: man-made <mark>climate change</mark> represents a serious threat to our collective well-being, and we're running out of time to take action. The Big Pivot shows what <mark>climate change</mark> and other human-caused pressures such as resource constraints mean for business—and what companies can do about it.&quot; <STRONG>
− Michael E. Mann, Distinguished Professor of Meteorology, Penn State University; author, The Hockey Stick and the <mark>Climate</mark> Wars</STRONG></P><P>&quot;In The Big Pivot, Andrew Winston makes the choice stark: large corporates can embrace the greatest wealth creation opportunity of our time, or go the way of companies whose business models were destroyed by previous rounds of <mark>innovation</mark>—in this case resource-efficiency <mark>innovation</mark>.&quot; <STRONG>
− Jigar Shah, founder, SunEdison; author, Creating <mark>Climate</mark> Wealth</STRONG></P><P>&quot;The world of corporate sustainability is fast-moving, subtle, and correspondingly hard to interpret. Andrew Winston is the archetypal 'insider-outsider'—with huge knowledge of the inner workings of many of the key companies in the vanguard of corporate sustainability today, combined with a robust independence and analytical flair. That's what makes The Big Pivot such a timely and fascinating read.&quot; <STRONG>
− Jonathon Porritt, founder, Forum for the Future; author, The World We Made</STRONG></P><P>&quot;Our times call for a massive elevation of consciousness around societal imperatives—and we must leverage the power of capitalism to that end. Andrew Winston takes a pragmatic approach in calling for dramatic business-model evolution to drive progress. In particular, to 'collaborate radically' we need much greater transparency and aligned incentive structures across the capital markets. Private-sector leadership has the capacity to make this Big Pivot. Now it needs the will.&quot; <STRONG>
− Erika Karp, CEO, Cornerstone Capital</STRONG></P><P>&quot;In The Big Pivot, Andrew Winston has beautifully captured the changing nature of our world. More important, his highly readable book shows the way forward for businesses that want to take advantage of and profit from new opportunities—and build twenty-first century solutions.&quot; <STRONG>

	Executive officers may receive long-term equity incentive awards of stock options, restricted stock or restricted share units, or a combination of stock options, restricted stock and restricted share units under the 2011 Plan, which was approved by stockholders in 2011. The 2011 Plan provides the Committee with discretion to require performance-based standards to be met before awards vest. The Committee awarded time-vested restricted share units to Mr. Allgaier in 2017 in connection with his hire which vest in one-fifth increments on each of the first through fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. In 2017, each named executive officer received grants of stock options and performance-based restricted share units under the 2011 Plan.
</FONT></P><P style=""TEXT-ALIGN: LEFT""><FONT size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">
	For grants of stock options, the 2011 Plan provides that the option price per share shall be no less than the closing price per share of our common stock at the grant date. The term of any option is no more than ten years from the grant date. Options granted in 2017 become exercisable in three annual installments of 30 percent, 30 percent and 40 percent, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date; however, all of the options become exercisable for the earlier of three years or the remaining term of the options upon death or total and permanent disability, and for the earlier of five years or the remaining term of the options, upon retirement of the officer. In addition, options generally become exercisable upon a termination of employment following a change of control, and certain options granted to our named executive officers are subject to our Executive Severance Plan. See “Potential Payments on Termination or Change of Control.” The officers may transfer the options to family members or certain entities in which family members have interests.
</FONT></P><P style=""TEXT-ALIGN: LEFT""><FONT size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">
	Performance-based restricted share unit awards granted in 2017 vest three years following the grant date in a range from zero to 200 percent of the target levels. Awards that vest, if any, are based on our average annual net sales growth and average adjusted ROIC performance during the three years. As of February 7, 2018, the performance-based restricted share units granted in 2017 and 2016 were on pace to vest at the following levels: 83 percent for the 2017 award and 107 percent for the 2016 award. The Committee has determined that the 2015 award vested at 100 percent.
</FONT></P><P style=""TEXT-ALIGN: LEFT""><FONT size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">
	Dividend equivalents on unvested performance-based restricted share units equal to cash dividends on our common stock are accumulated and will be paid in additional shares after the performance-based restricted share units vest, based on the actual number of shares that vest, if any. Dividend equivalents on the time-vested restricted share units granted to Mr. Allgaier in 2017 will be accumulated and paid in additional shares when the time-vested restricted share units vest, if any.

These members include Dell, L’Oreal and Walmart, and they represent a combined spending power of US$1 trillion.  The research marks CDP Supply Chain’s most comprehensive annual update on the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on corporate supply chains.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><mark>Climate change</mark> presents near-term risks to businesses, according to the report. Fifty-one percent of the risks that disclosing companies associate with drought or extreme rain are already having an adverse effect on company operations, or are expected to within five years, say those businesses. Additionally, the destructive nature of extreme weather is likely a catalyst for company action on <mark>climate change</mark>, with physical <mark>climate</mark> risk identified in the report as a greater driver of investment than <mark>climate policy</mark>. Of the 678 companies investing in emissions reduction initiatives, three quarters (73 percent) say they feel that <mark>climate change</mark> presents a physical risk to their operations; just 13 percent identify regulation as a sole driver. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Most of the positive actions responding companies say they have taken in response to <mark>climate change</mark> are attributable to organizations that have been using CDP’s unique global system for at least two years, demonstrating that customer pressure is driving change. However, the report identifies a performance gap between companies and their suppliers, and it claims that this is intensifying <mark>climate</mark> risk in the global supply chain models. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Suppliers are significantly less prepared than their clients to respond to <mark>climate change</mark>, potentially threatening customer relationships and heightening supply chain vulnerability. Suppliers demonstrate a lower level of ambition to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark> risk, with just 38 percent setting emission reductions targets in comparison to 92 percent of purchasing companies. Similarly, at 27 percent, the percentage of suppliers investing in activities to reduce emissions is less than half that of CDP member companies (69 percent).</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Unsurprisingly, CDP members are more likely to yield results from their environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark> business practices than suppliers, according to the survey. They are more than twice as likely to accomplish year-on-year emissions reductions (63 percent vs. 29 percent), and are better positioned to capitalize on the financial benefits of <mark>carbon</mark> management. While 73 percent of members are achieving monetary savings, such as reduced energy costs from emission reductions activities, only 29 percent of suppliers are enjoying such returns.</DIV><DIV><B> </B></DIV><DIV><B>Paul Simpson, CDP’s chief executive officer </B>says: “This research illuminates fragility in the global supply chain model. The marked difference in the <mark>sustainable</mark> actions of companies and their suppliers highlights a missed opportunity for suppliers to reduce energy costs and risks. The 61 percent of suppliers that failed to provide information through CDP are an even greater concern since they and their clients are unable to make a full assessment of the substantial <mark>climate</mark> risks or opportunities they face.”</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>The analysis of the information, processed through CDP’s unique global system for natural capital disclosure – now the largest and most comprehensive in the world – demonstrates the attractive returns that leading companies are enjoying from addressing supply chain sustainability. The 29 percent of suppliers that have reduced their emissions have saved some $13.7bn as a result. This implies aggregate potential savings of all 2,363 suppliers could reach three times that figure if the remaining proportion of suppliers were to achieve reductions at that rate. <SPAN>  </SPAN></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>“This report provides clear evidence that those who are most transparent about their <mark>climate change</mark> risks are more likely to achieve the greatest emissions reductions”, says <B>Gary Hanifan, global sustainability lead for supply chain, Accenture</B>. “And they are also more likely to enjoy monetary savings as a result of their responses to <mark>climate change</mark> risks. But the return on investment by the most proactive companies will not reach its full potential unless those companies can encourage their suppliers to follow their lead.”</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>The report is freely available from the CDP and Accenture websites. It provides advice on how companies can use data, process and governance to create a more <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain and capitalize on the correlations between <mark>climate</mark> risk, performance and accountability to realize financial benefit. The report also includes supplier scoring data provided by the CDP Supply Chain scoring partner, First<mark>Carbon</mark> Solutions. Scores are available by region and sector, and show that European and Asian companies still outperform companies in North America.</DIV><DIV><B> </B></DIV><DIV>Companies experienced in disclosing to CDP are nearly twice as likely to realize benefits from taking action on <mark>climate change</mark></DIV><DIV><B> </B></DIV><DIV><B>About CDP</B></DIV><DIV>The <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project (CDP) is an international, not-for-profit organization providing the only global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share vital environmental information. CDP works with market forces, including 655 institutional investors with assets of US$78 trillion, to motivate companies to disclose their impacts on the environment and natural resources and take action to reduce them. CDP now holds the largest collection globally of primary <mark>climate change</mark> and water information and puts these insights at the heart of strategic business, investment and policy decisions. Please visit <SPAN><A href=""http://www.cdproject.net"">www.cdproject.net</A></SPAN> to find out more.</DIV><DIV><B> </B></DIV><DIV><B>CDP Supply Chain member companies</B></DIV><DIV>Accenture, Acer Inc., Amdocs Ltd., AT&amp;T Inc., Banco Bradesco S/A, Bank of America, Braskem S/A, British Sky Broadcasting, BT Group, City of Denver, Colgate Palmolive Company, Dell Inc., Diageo Plc., Domtar Inc., EADS N.V., Eaton Corporation, Eletropaulo Metropolitana Eletricidade de São Paulo S/A, Elopak, Endesa, Eni SpA, FIBRIA Celulose, Ford Motor Company, Goldman Sachs Group,, Groupe Steria, Imperial Tobacco Group, Jaguar Land Rover Ltd, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Johnson Controls, JT International SA, Juniper Networks, KAO Corporation, <mark>Kimberly-Clark Corpo</mark>ration, KPMG UK, L’Oreal, Marfrig Alimentos, MetLife, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, National Australia Bank, National Grid, Nestle, Nokia-Siemens Networks, PepsiCo, Philips Electronics N.V., Reckitt Benckiser, Rexam, S.C.

Clearcut logging is the complete removal of all trees in a given area, a practice that can be devastating to people and animals alike.</P><P>The Natural Resources Defense Council has described clearcutting as “<A href=""http://www.nrdc.org/land/forests/fcut.asp"">an ecological trauma that has no precedent in nature except for a major volcanic eruption.</A>” According to a study titled “<A href=""http://www.borealbirds.org/sites/default/files/pubs/report-full.pdf"">The <mark>Carbon</mark> the World Forgot</A>,” boreal forests contain 703 gigatons of <mark>carbon</mark>, while the world’s tropical forests contain 375. The boreal needs to be maintained, but for years Kimberly-Clark’s clearcut logging practices did just the opposite.</P><P>Clearcutting is cheaper for logging companies, which means less overhead and more profit for corporations. This is no excuse for Kimberly-Clark to support un<mark>sustainable</mark> practices from loggers that auditors discovered leaving more than one million cubic meters of trees cut and left to rot on logging roads in the Kenogami Forest of Northern Canada.</P><H2>Introducing the Kleercut Campaign</H2><P>In 2004, we initiated the Kleercut Campaign. A public relations assault was waged on multiple fronts. Activists crashed a stockholder’s meeting by distributing pamphlets titled “Kimberly Clark: Investing in Forest Destruction,” and setting up a “Forest Crime Scene” outside of Kimberly-Clark’s headquarters. These creative ways of getting the public’s attention galvanized support and rallied supporters to join the fight against deforestation.</P><H2>The Boreal Day of Action Goes Global</H2><P>On November 3, 2005, a grassroots campaign culminated in the “Boreal Day of Action,” with 350 events in 200 cities spanning the U.S. and Canada. There were demonstrations outside Kimberly-Clark facilities across the globe, including in New York City, Toronto, London, and Hamburg.</P><P>This advertisement showed up in the New York Times, attacking Kimberly-Clark in its most vulnerable place—their flagship brand, Kleenex.</P><H2>Corporate America Throws Its Support Behind Boreal with the Forest Friendly 500</H2><P>As Kimberly-Clark refused to budge, the movement to stop deforestation gained in momentum and allies. We started the Forest Friendly 500 initiative, asking businesses to pledge to stop wiping away Canada’s boreal forests by replacing their Kleenex brand facial tissues with a different brand that uses more recycled tissue.</P><P>Activists continued direct action; they blockaded Kimberly-Clark mills and staged events in front of various Kimberly-Clark buildings. In 2009, we released the “Recycled Tissue and Toilet Paper Guide,” which was later complemented with an app buying guide.</P><H2>Kleercut Case Closed: Kimberly-Clark Adopts Zero Deforestation Policy</H2><P>After several years of effort from thousands of supporters across the globe, Kimberly-Clark outlined a sourcing strategy that makes it an industry leader in <mark>sustainable</mark> logging practices. It set a 2011 goal to have 40 percent of the fiber in North American tissue products either recycled or certified by the Forest Stewardship Council—a 71 percent increase from 2007 levels.</P><P>More importantly, their demand to logging companies for sustainably logged outpaced production. This meant logging companies themselves were forced to shift toward more environmentally friendly forms of acquiring timber, leading to less deforestation in the entire industry. It set precedent for a higher standard of <mark>sustainable</mark> logging, while sending big business a message that consumers are willing to choose with their wallets when it comes to protecting the environment.</P></DIV><DIV class=""articleFooter""><SECTION class=""actionList""><H2 class=""actionList-title largeTitle"">Take Action</H2></SECTION></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

Would business leaders forge ahead in the fight against <mark>climate change</mark> in the absence of federal backing?</P><P>
In 2017, at least, the answer is yes. </P><P>
As of December 12, when heads of state joined to commemorate the second anniversary of the Paris Agreement, 327 major corporations, worth a cumulative $6.5 trillion, had committed to matching their emission reduction plans with the Paris goals through the <A href=""http://sciencebasedtargets.org/about-the-science-based-targets-initiative/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Science Based Targets</A> initiative. Another 864 companies have stated their intention to adopt a science-based target within two years. </P><P>
These companies hail from some 50 countries and 70 sectors, including finance, chemicals, food processing, technology hardware and more. Companies headquartered in the U.S. make up 20 percent of the group and have made the greatest number of <mark>climate</mark> commitments to date, despite uncertainty surrounding the American government's participation in the Paris accord.</P><P>
In addition, some 1,700 U.S. businesses from every state and of varying sizes -- from Walmart to Wild Joe’s Coffee Spot in Bozeman, Montana -- have signed the “<A href=""https://www.wearestillin.com/we-are-still-declaration"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">We Are Still In</A>” declaration. The initiative, which also includes cities, statehouses and college campuses, was intended to demonstrate America’s enduring commitment to delivering on the promise of the Paris Agreement.</P><P>
Apple, for instance, issued a <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-<mark>climate</mark>-greenbond/apple-issues-1-billion-green-bond-after-trumps-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-exit-idUSKBN1941ZE"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">$1 billion green bond</A> in June, shortly after Trump announced his exit from the <mark>climate</mark> deal, which CEO Tim Cook tried to convince the president <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-05/apple-ceo-says-trump-advisory-councils-aren-t-productive"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">not to quit.</A> This is the tech giant’s second green bond, following a <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-greenbonds/apple-issues-1-5-billion-in-green-bonds-in-first-sale-idUSKCN0VQ2K2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">$1.5 billion offering</A> that came in response to the Paris Agreement last year. Proceeds from the green bond sales will be used to finance renewable energy and energy efficiency projects at Apple facilities.</P><P>
In another significant development this year, Walmart launched Project Gigaton, which asks its suppliers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 1 gigaton by 2030. That amounts to the equivalent of taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads for an entire year.</P><P>
Walmart is “bypassing the politics” to focus on driving down emissions internally and in its supply chain, said the company's Chief Sustainability Officer Kathleen McLaughlin, speaking at the New York Times’ <mark>Climate</mark>TECH conference in late November. There is a business case for supporting <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture, combating deforestation, reducing waste and purchasing renewables, she said. Cost savings is one, but there’s also the potential for business-model <mark>innovation</mark>, improved product quality and increased sales revenue.</P><P>“In light of the withdrawal from the Paris accord…I wouldn’t say the political winds are favorable to the <mark>climate</mark> agenda right now,” McLaughlin said. “But we’re trying to make it practical and favorable just from a common-sense point of view.”</P><P>
Walmart signed the We Are Still in pledge, she added, because “we think we need to show the rest of the world that there is still a critical mass of American companies of states and cities working on this, to drive [<mark>climate</mark> action] forward.” </P><H2><STRONG>New recruits to the 100 percent group</STRONG><P>
As part of their <mark>climate</mark> action plans, 119 companies have committed to sourcing renewable energy for 100 percent of their operations through the <A href=""http://there100.org/companies"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">RE100 initiative</A>. That's up from 56 members a year and a half ago.</P><P>
Schneider Electric is the latest company to commit to 100 percent renewable electricity through RE100, with a 2030 target date. The European multinational also pledged to double its energy productivity by 2030, from a 2005 baseline, through an initiative called <A href=""https://www.the<mark>climate</mark>group.org/project/ep100"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">EP100</A>. </P><P> “When it comes to the <mark>climate</mark>, I’m neither an optimist nor a pessimist -- I’m an activist,” said Schneider Electric Chairman and CEO Jean-Pascal Tricoire, in a statement. “Prosperity and energy are intertwined.”</P><P>
Other recent additions to the RE100 list include Estée Lauder, Kellogg, DBS Bank and Clif Bar. Citi Group also made the 100 percent renewables pledge in September, on top of the company’s vow to finance $100 billion in clean energy, infrastructure and technology projects. </P><P>
Meanwhile, French utility EDF Group recently committed to transitioning to electric vehicles by 2030 through <A href=""https://www.the<mark>climate</mark>group.org/project/ev100"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">EV100</A>, a new initiative that seeks to make electric transport “the new normal.” All three initiatives -- RE100, EP100 and EV100 -- are led by the international nonprofit organization The <mark>Climate</mark> Group.</P><P>
The increasing <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/were-still-underestimating-cost-improvements-for-batteries"">cost-competitiveness</A> of lithium-ion batteries has made electric trucks, <A href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/whats-sparking-electric-vehicle-adoption-in-the-truck-industry"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">and shorter-haul vehicles in particular</A>, an attractive investment for many companies. UPS, for instance, currently owns 120 electric trucks in the U.S. and more than 140 of them abroad. In New York City alone, UPS is planning to convert up to 1,500 tucks to EVs by 2022.</P><P>
To support its electrification goals UPS recently placed advance orders for the <A href=""http://https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/tesla-electric-semi-truck-toughest-musk"">newly introduced Tesla Semi</A>. <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/12/pepsico-orders-100-electric-tesla-semi-trucks-largest-pre-order-date/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">PepsiCo</A>, Walmart and several others have also preordered the Tesla truck, which is scheduled for delivery in 2019.</P><P>
It took Walmart a decade to double the fuel efficiency of its trucking fleet in an attempt to reduce fossil fuel use and cut costs, but the company still uses an enormous amount of fuel, said McLaughlin. The company is excited to pilot the Tesla Semi and other electrified platforms because &quot;we envision a world where our fleet is run completely on renewable energy and we think this is an exciting step that allows us to experiment with that,” she said.</P><P>
With electric trucks either on the market or expected from manufacturers such as BYD, Daimler, Volvo, Tevva Motors, <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/startup-chanje-emerges-to-sell-electric-trucks"">Chanje</A> and several others, corporate customers will soon have lots of options to buy electric. The rise of electric trucks coupled with exponential growth in the number of passenger EV models has made a campaign like EDF Group’s commitment to EV100 achievable.</P></H2><H2><STRONG>The biggest corporate deals of 2017</STRONG><P>
EDF hasn’t only been active on cleantech internally. Like many other energy companies, EDF has also played a growing role in serving others in the corporate sector this year.</P><P>
In late November, EDF Renewable Energy, a subsidiary of EDF Group, announced a deal to supply Google with 200 megawatts of wind energy generated from the new <A href=""https://www.edf-re.com/project/glaciers-edge-wind-project/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Glaciers Edge Wind Project</A> in Iowa. Glaciers Edge is the third deal EDF RE has done with Google, and it is expected to come on-line in December 2019. Once complete, the wind farm will help Google reach its <A href=""https://environment.google/projects/announcement-100/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">goal</A> of purchasing enough renewable energy to match its consumption for global operations.</P><P>
Google also signed agreements in recent weeks for wind-generated electricity from Avangrid’s Coyote Ridge and Tatanka Ridge wind farms in South Dakota, both of which are 98 megawatts, as well as 140 megawatts from the 300-megawatt Red Dirt site in Oklahoma. The cumulative 536 megawatts Google purchased from U.S. wind farms in November puts the company’s total renewable energy procurement to date above 3 gigawatts.</P><P>
These wind deals are just the latest in a long list of corporate renewable energy procurements this year. While 2017 won’t be record-breaking, it will be the second-best year for corporate renewable deals, according to the Rocky Mountain Institute’s <A href=""http://businessrenewables.org/corporate-transactions/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Business Renewables Center.</A></P><P>
&quot;<mark>Sustainable</mark> companies, led by tech giants and other leading Fortune 100s, are moving forward on their clean energy commitments,” Jacob Susman, head of origination for EDF RE, wrote in an email. This comes despite uncertainty around federal tax implications and the potential for new solar tariffs. According to Susman, “this is a testament to the value, risk mitigation, and societal and environmental benefits they perceive from adding renewables to their portfolios.&quot;</P><P>
Notable deals include Anheuser-Busch’s virtual power-purchase agreement with Enel Green Power for 152.5 megawatts of the 298-megawatt Thunder Ranch wind farm in Billings, Oklahoma. The renewable energy produced under the PPA is equivalent to meeting 50 percent of Anheuser-Busch’s total electricity needs in one year, which is enough renewable electricity to produce more than 20 billion 12-ounce servings of beer annually. The Anheuser-Busch agreement marks a significant step toward delivering on parent company <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/ab-inbev-says-it-can-go-100-renewable-in-7-years-or-less"">AB InBev’s global commitment</A> to secure 100 percent of purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.</P><P>
JPMorgan Chase, which <A href=""https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/Corporate-Responsibility/document/jpmc-cr-sustainability-fact-sheet.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">recently committed</A> to facilitating at least $200 billion in clean financing over the next eight years, signed a 20-year PPA with NRG for a 100-megawatt wind project this year as part of the <A href=""http://https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170728005062/en/JPMorgan-Chase-100-Percent-Reliant-Renewable-Energy"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bank’s commitment</A> to cover all of its power needs with renewables by 2020. While JPMorgan does not disclose how much power that amounts to, it will have to cover the real estate footprint of more 5,500 properties in 60 countries. To reach that goal, the company is also evaluating on-site solar options on up to 1,400 bank-owned retail buildings and 40 commercial buildings worldwide.</P><P>
At the same time, America’s biggest bank is cutting energy use at its <A href=""http://https://www.energymanagertoday.com/jp-morgan-chase-increase-energy-efficiency-4500-branches-0170871/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">4,500 U.S. branches</A> through the use of new energy management and digital technologies. Chase is partnering with GE’s Current to install sensors, software and lighting controls that will help bank branches reduce electric and gas consumption by 15 percent. The company also continues to offset 100 percent of emissions generated by employee air travel on an annual basis. Collectively, these actions put JPMorgan Chase on track to reach its goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.</P><P>
Kimberly-Clark also made some big commitments to clean energy in 2017, with the corporation’s first major renewables agreement to buy 245 megawatts and 1 million megawatt-hours of electricity from two new wind projects in Texas and Oklahoma. In October, Amazon <A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503602/jeff-bezos-amazon-wind-farm-champagne-smash-video"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">made a splash</A> with its largest wind farm announced to date.</P></H2><H2>
The next frontier of corporate purchasing: Smaller buyers<P>
Industry giants with household names are currently leading the way with renewable energy purchases, but the corporate clean energy market is starting to diversify and appeal to smaller players.</P><P>“The next frontier of corporate purchasing is for corporate buyers with smaller appetites to increase their renewables contracting in a meaningful way,” said EDF’s Susman.</P><P>
Expanding markets to these smaller players has proved to be a challenge, however.</P><P>
In an <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/large-corporations-are-driving-americas-renewable-energy-boom#gs.lvrPBw0"">interview earlier this year,</A> Patrick Flynn, director of sustainability at Salesforce, pointed out that in the commercial renewables sector “growth is driven by a handful of large, experienced corporations” and the top priority should be to “lower barriers to entry” for other companies.</P><P>
While many companies are choosing to bypass federal politics to act on their <mark>climate</mark> agenda, policy <mark>innovation</mark> at the state and local level continues to be critical for the commercial renewables sector. That’s true for companies of all sizes, but it’s especially so for smaller businesses that are more price-sensitive.</P><P>
In regulated markets, <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/more-corporations-are-turning-to-utilities-to-source-renewable-energy#gs.Ht7cgP4"">utility green tariff programs</A> are an emerging option for corporate customers. As of September, <A href=""http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/emerging-green-tariffs-in-us-regulated-electricity-markets-sep2017_0.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">17 green tariffs in 13 states</A> have been proposed or approved since NV Energy put forward the first green tariff in 2013, according to the World Resources Institute.</P><P>
Green tariffs come in different forms and flavors. Puget Sound Energy, for instance, launched the first subscriber-style green tariff to be used by retailers and small governments in April. While most existing green tariffs are designed to enable a single, new and very large customer to contract for an entire renewable energy project, <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/washington-state-spearheads-a-novel-clean-energy-solution-for-starbucks-re#gs.po03yPQ"">PSE's Green Direct program</A> allows existing customers to contract for a more modest portion of a big clean energy project, which could enable smaller corporate players to participate.</P><P>
In North Carolina, <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/north-carolinas-solar-market-has-moved-beyond-infancy-stakeholders-are-now#gs.F6mzV10"">a July law</A> reintroduced a Green Source Rider Program that allows corporations, the military, and the University of North Carolina to purchase renewables. The same law, HB 589, also legalized third-party leasing of renewable energy systems, which could be a viable option for the business community.</P><P>
If companies don’t get the policy arrangement they want, regulated utilities risk losing corporate customers. Pressure from large corporate buyers is spurring utilities <A href=""http://https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/business/energy-environment/coal-power-renewable-energy.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">in the heart of coal country</A> to find renewable energy solutions -- despite President Trump’s calls for a coal renaissance. In Nevada, casinos such MGM and Wynn Resorts are leaving the grid to buy clean energy from outside suppliers, and now the state is <A href=""https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/with-deregulation-looming-energy-choice-commission-begins-tackling-tough-questions"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">considering deregulation</A>.</P><P>
Other parts of the country, a different set of policy solutions has cropped up. San Francisco Public Utility Commission's <A href=""https://sfwater.org/index.aspx?page=748"" rel=""nofollow"">CleanPowerSF program</A>, for instance, helped Salesforce to source 100 percent renewable energy for its two office towers in San Francisco in August.</P><P>
In deregulated markets, where most clean energy deals have been done to date, corporate buyers have more flexibility in their renewable energy purchasing options. But even here policy remains central. In all states, renewable energy targets, net metering policies, utility rate schedules, permitting processes, government incentives and other policy elements affect how easy or hard it is for companies of various sizes to purchase renewable energy.</P></H2><H2><STRONG>Hospitals get active on renewable energy policy</STRONG><P>
In a testament to the role policy plays, healthcare providers in Ohio recently <A href=""https://info.aee.net/hubfs/AE_Healthcare_Signon_12.6.17.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">sent a letter</A> to state lawmakers calling on them to stand behind the state’s clean energy standards and correct restrictive <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/setback-changes-will-end-new-wind-farms-in-ohio"">wind siting requirements</A>. The letter asks for a “comprehensive approach to Ohio’s energy policy” that would “value innovative technologies that institute energy efficiency and demand response as a resource and expand the deployment of advanced energy technologies that curb energy costs to consumers.”</P><P>
After several years of policy uncertainty, Ohio’s renewable energy and efficiency mandates were officially <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/gov-kasich-vetoes-renewables-efficiency-freeze-in-ohio"">reinstated late last year</A>. This year, the issue <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/squared/read/ohios-clean-energy-mandates-are-back-on-the-chopping-block#gs.ebvb4rw"">cropped up again</A>. In March, the Ohio House of Representatives <A href=""https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA132-HB-114"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">passed a bill</A> to make the mandates voluntary. The legislation has since been taken up by the Senate, and Senate President Larry Obhof has said he’ll <A href=""http://radio.wosu.org/post/ohio-senate-plans-kill-beleagured-green-energy-standards#stream/0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">advance the bill</A> in January. </P><P>
Meanwhile, there’s an ongoing debate in Ohio around the need to subsidize coal and nuclear plants.</P><P>“What both the advanced energy industry and healthcare providers would like to see from lawmakers is a move to put innovative technologies on a level playing field with some of the other incumbent technologies in the state, basically allowing competition to thrive,” said Ray Fakhoury, state policy associate at Advanced Energy Economy, which helped to facilitate the Ohio energy policy letter.</P><P>
Large companies like Kaiser Permanente and Partners HealthCare have made sizable investments in renewables in recent years, but healthcare providers have generally taken a cautious approach to renewables. There’s hesitancy to make the upfront investment when healthcare needs are so high and some concern around disrupting hospital operations during installation. But the sector is starting to see a shift.</P><P>
Because hospitals are the <A href=""http://www.sustainabilityroadmap.org/topics/energy.shtml#.WkP_d7T80d1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">second most energy-intensive facility type</A> in the U.S., renewables present a significant cost savings opportunity for the sector. Hospitals also need power around-the-clock and stand to benefit from clean energy microgrids in the event of an outage. Recent disasters such as the Boston bombing attack and Hurricane Harvey have underscored the need for uninterrupted electrical service at hospitals, according to a <A href=""https://microgridknowledge.com/clean-energy-microgrids-hospitals/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">recent report</A> sponsored by Ameresco.</P><P>“We’re now seeing hospitals get involved [in renewables] in a more active way, because pushing for access to a diverse portfolio of resources is something they’re interested in and Ohio is a state they’re looking to,” said Fakhoury.</P><P>
Signers of the letter include the Cleveland Clinic, the Ohio Hospital Association Energy and Sustainability Program, and the CEOs of Mercy Health, Mount Carmel Health System, and Tri-Health. Energy business leaders signing the letter include executives from First Solar, Apex Clean Energy and Siemens.</P></H2><H2><STRONG>Small commercial solar remains tricky</STRONG><P>
Of all companies, purchasing solar is the biggest challenge among the smallest players. Small and medium-sized businesses have traditionally been a “<A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/time-to-give-small-commercial-solar-more-attention"">no man’s land</A>” for solar installers.</P><P>
Between 2012 and 2016, commercial solar installations were virtually flat due to project financing challenges, lengthy development timelines and heavy reliance on incentives.</P><P>
According to GTM Research, commercial solar hit its highest year of installations in 2016 as the market experienced demand pull-in in response to two impending regulatory deadlines on solar-friendly rate structures came in California and the qualification period for obtaining the full SREC value in Massachusetts. These factors continued to drive deployments in 2017, but growth is expected to drop in 2018 and only grow incrementally over the next five years.</P><P>
Legal fees and complex contract negotiations create substantial transaction costs for commercial project developers and owners. Customer acquisition is time-consuming and highly localized. And attractive financing is only available to a subset of the market. Small and medium-sized businesses don’t enjoy the investment-grade credit that the Fortune 100 companies do.</P><P>
There’s still high interest in this market segment, however. Entities such as NextEra, NRG, AES and <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/duke-energy-takes-full-ownership-of-rec-solar"">Duke’s REC Solar</A> are active in the commercial solar space and competing to provide comprehensive low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy packages for customers.</P><P>
Commercial solar asset owners are also <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/shifts-in-asset-ownership-strategies-are-concentrating-commercial-solar"">taking more control</A> of their projects from the outset, rather than acquiring projects at a later date. Taking more control can eliminate speed bumps like having to repeat due diligence on project financing, according to GTM Research solar analyst Michelle Davis, author of the <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/shifts-in-asset-ownership-strategies-are-concentrating-commercial-solar#gs.iBV8MP0""><EM>Commercial Solar Asset Ownership</EM></A> report. This trend could increase commercial solar installation volumes and concentrate the market beyond 2017.</P></H2><H2><STRONG>Going global</STRONG><P>
While there’s still a huge opportunity to tap into the commercial renewables market in the U.S., most of the larger, mature buyers are now starting to direct their attention elsewhere.</P><P>
According to the Business Renewables Center, North America accounted for more than 75 percent of global corporate PPAs through August 2017. But markets in South America, Europe and Asia have the potential for significant growth.</P><P>
A <A href=""https://rmi.org/news/report-release-state-market-2017-corporate-renewable-procurement-china/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">recent report</A> by the Rocky Mountain Institute found that new opportunities for companies to use cleaner power in China could increase the country’s wind and solar capacity by 40 percent over 2016 levels by 2020. China is already the global leader on renewable energy deployment, but it currently offers few scalable options for companies to use 100 percent renewables.</P><P>
But things are starting to change.</P><P> </P><P>
China is undergoing its most significant electricity reform in a generation, according to the report. As a result, the number of options for corporate buyers is increasing. In March 2017, for instance, the government established ground rules for community solar, opening a new mechanism to procure local power for companies without sufficient rooftop access. RMI identified eight other new and existing pathways to expand corporate renewable energy procurements in China.</P><P>
In some cases, policies and market dynamics in countries outside of the U.S. are better than those that exist within the U.S. </P><P>
Walmart, for instance, has a goal to reach 100 percent renewables across its global network, and currently sits around 25 percent renewable today. But in the U.S., that number is actually closer to 12 percent, due to “the regulatory environment, pricing environment, infrastructure, technology and so forth,” said McLaughlin.</P><P>
Because large corporations have such large international footprints, they can’t afford not to lead on <mark>climate</mark> action or they could miss out on a business opportunity.</P><P>“We’re a global company, we operate all around the world, and so wherever we can, we like to have that certainty that there’s a level playing field wherever we operate,” said Todd Brady, director of global public affairs and sustainability at Intel, on a panel at <mark>Climate</mark>TECH. “I think that makes a strong business case for staying in the Paris Agreement.”</P><P>
The World Resources Institute <A href=""http://www.wri.org/blog/2017/12/3-things-companies-can-do-2018-push-global-<mark>climate</mark>-action"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">identified three things</A> company leaders can do push global <mark>climate</mark> action further in 2018: show up and speak up at high-level events, align their corporate <mark>climate</mark> goals with countries’ <mark>climate</mark> goals, and meet with ministers to help break down silos within and between governments, leading to a more cohesive policy framework.</P><P>
At the COP23 <mark>climate</mark> conference in November, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres’ had <A href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/private-sector-called-upon-to-disrupt-business-as_us_5a183d63e4b0250a107bff03"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">a message</A> for businesses: “I am asking you to misbehave.” He called for companies around the world to disrupt &quot;business-as-usual&quot; and urge governments to ramp up their <mark>climate</mark> action plans.</P><P>
Hundreds of businesses, in the U.S. and abroad, have accepted the secretary’s challenge. Now, the world will be watching for them to follow through.</P></H2></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

For many commodities, there are two places where recovered material flows are breaking down: 1) Quality recycled feedstock is not available, despite increasing manufacturer demand for domestic, local feedstocks; and 2) Recyclable materials are not efficiently collected and processed, despite efforts to collect these materials after use and aggregate them into a quality product.  </SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">For plastic, paper and aluminum, this is typically a bale of some sort for sale or donation. For these materials, this breakdown occurs whether the consumption occurs at home, the office, the loading dock or on-the-go. For residential recycling, 50 to 60 percent of recycling costs are in collection according to the Solid Waste Association of North American. Manufacturing facilities in many areas throughout the U.S. often struggle to obtain collection services for their recyclables and byproducts.</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">A company’s role to implement circular economy projects must be based on its contribution in the value chain to make a compelling business case for participation. The Circular Economy Value Chain and Key Drivers diagram below represents a basic recovery value chain. Note, there are nine key players and different drivers from which to identify shared interests from their different vantage points. Notice how many of these interests overlap. </SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">Reprocessors and manufacturers are trying to meet customers’ requirements for recycled content but are dealing with quality issued from commodity bales.

 There is no off-the-shelf model that can be used to define sustainability and create programs. Ultimately, a company must adopt its own definition of sustainability, and establish its principles based on its business model and corporate values. Once the sustainability strategy is defined, a company must determine appropriate objectives and targets that align with the strategy. Attendees will learn from varying industries about the process for finding the right sustainability &quot;fit&quot; determining a plan for setting goals and progressing forward.</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Bruce Klafter</STRONG>, <EM>Managing Director, EHS</EM>; Applied Materials Inc.</LI><LI><STRONG> Paul Narog</STRONG>, <EM>Manager, Environmental Operations</EM>; 3M Co.</LI><LI><STRONG>Laura Bradford</STRONG>, <EM>Associate Director, Corporate EHS/Sustainability</EM>; 3Bristol-Myers Squibb</LI></UL><P><STRONG>Moderator Chair: Emily Barton</STRONG>, <EM>Corporate EHS Manager</EM>; Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.</P><P><STRONG>Session 6: Beyond traditional EHS Metrics: What Social Metrics are Leading Companies Tracking?</STRONG> 
 As companies embrace the triple bottom line, many have set very specific and consistent economic and environmental metrics, and are increasingly looking at the third leg of the stool: social metrics. This session will explore what companies are doing in this emerging area. How are they addressing human rights along with traditional H&amp;S metrics? What other social metrics are companies beginning to establish? What are the social metrics that third-party NGOs feel are most important? Are there indicators companies should be tracking that they currently aren’t?</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Julie Brautigam</STRONG>, <EM>Director, Ethics, Compliance and Sustainability</EM>; Baxter Healthcare Corp.</LI><LI><STRONG>Andrew Syed</STRONG>, <EM>Manager Environmental &amp; Social Responsibility</EM>; Newmont Mining Corp.</LI><LI><STRONG>Peggy Ward</STRONG>, <EM>Director Sustainability</EM>; <mark>Kimberly-Clark Corp.</mark></LI></UL><P><STRONG>Moderator Chair: Lisa Barnes</STRONG>, <EM>Technical Director, <mark>Climate Change</mark> Services</EM>; Bureau Veritas</P><P><STRONG>Session 10: Understanding Water Stewardship as a Critical Business Issue</STRONG>
 Water has been dubbed by many as the &quot;next <mark>carbon</mark>&quot;. So how does a company understand water resources as a pillar of sustainability? Beyond water reduction programs, how should water fit into corporate sustainability strategy? Attendees in this session will learn what external ratings firms are looking for as well as how two companies are navigating these issues, both in terms of the steps they are taking to develop their programs as well as the lessons learned from a company with a mature water sustainability program in place.</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Todd Brady</STRONG>, <EM>Director, Corporate Environmental</EM>; Intel Corp.</LI><LI><STRONG> Julie Frieder</STRONG>, <EM>Senior Sustainability Analyst</EM>; Calvert Investments</LI><LI><STRONG>Kris Morico</STRONG>, <EM>Global Leader</EM>; GE Water Programs</LI></UL><P><STRONG>Moderator Chair: Bob Zimmerman</STRONG>, <EM>Environmental Project Manager</EM>; Campbell Soup Co.</P><P><STRONG>Session 14: Making it to the top of the List: Can you &quot;manage&quot; your sustainability ranking among third party analysts?</STRONG>
 EHS&amp;S managers receive about 40 external information requests a year for sustainability and EHS performance information. Many of these surveys are used to inform corporate rating lists, others are used by socially responsible investment fund managers to make decisions about what stocks to buy. As an EHS&amp;S manager tasked with responding, what do you need to know to ensure that your business is presented in the best, and most accurate way to investors, customers and the public? Attendees will hear tips from both companies and third-party analysts for how to get the good rating companies deserve.</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Tish Lascelle</STRONG>, <EM>Senior Director, EHS</EM>; Johnson &amp; Johnson</LI><LI><STRONG>Cary Krosinsky</STRONG>, <EM>Senior Vice President</EM>; TruCost</LI><LI><STRONG>Richard Crespin</STRONG>, <EM>Executive Director</EM>; Corporate Responsibility Officers Association</LI></UL><P><STRONG>Moderator Chair: Annette Russo</STRONG>, <EM>Manager, Communications, Training - Worldwide EHS</EM>; Johnson &amp; Johnson</P><P><STRONG>Session 18: Energy Management Best Practices: Short Term Wins and Long Term Investments</STRONG>

 It might be odd to hear someone say that we are only in the dawn of the corporate sustainability movement, but it appears to be true, based in part, on the incredible variety and sheer number of sustainability standards, metrics and rankings affecting global corporations. As an increasing number of stakeholder groups take an interest in shaping this movement and its outcomes, it is natural to ask, who is and who will be setting the performance and measurement standards? Will it be corporations, investors, customers, or NGOs? This session will explore perspectives and predictions of some of the early and most influential stakeholders. Attendees can expect to leave with a sense of how sustainability standards will evolve and how they can position their company to stay ahead of the curve for the next five, 10 or 20 years.</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Michael Muyot</STRONG>, <EM>President</EM>; CRD Analytics</LI><LI><STRONG> Ed Rogers</STRONG>, UPS Corporate Strategy Group</LI><LI><STRONG>Mike Wallace</STRONG>, <EM>Director</EM>; Global Reporting Initiative</LI></UL><P><STRONG>Moderator Chair: Michelle Redfield</STRONG>, <EM>Director, Environment and Process Improvement</EM>; Schneider Electric SA</P><P class=""cp-darkblue""><STRONG>Speaker Bios</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Bruce Klafter</STRONG>, <EM>Head of Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability</EM>; Applied Materials Inc.

                Lessons on eggs, flywheels, hedgehogs, buses, and other essentials 
                of business that can help you transform your company.</FONT></B><P> I want to give you a lobotomy about change. I want you to forget 
                everything youve ever learned about what it takes to create 
                great results. I want you to realize that nearly all operating 
                prescriptions for creating large-scale corporate change are nothing 
                but myths. 
              </P><P>
The Myth of the Change Program: This approach comes with the launch event, the tag line, and the cascading activities.
              </P><P> The Myth of the Burning Platform: This one says that change 
                starts only when theres a crisis that persuades unmotivated 
                employees to accept the need for change. 
              </P><P>
The Myth of Stock Options: Stock options, high salaries, and bonuses are incentives that grease the wheels of change.
              </P><P> The Myth of Fear-Driven Change: The fear of being left behind, 
                the fear of watching others win, the fear of presiding over monumental 
                failureall are drivers of change, were told. 
              </P><P>
The Myth of Acquisitions: You can buy your way to growth, so it figures that you can buy your way to greatness. 
              </P><P> The Myth of Technology-Driven Change: The breakthrough that youre looking 
                for can be achieved by using technology to leapfrog the competition. 
                            </P><P> The Myth of Revolution: Big change has to be wrenching, extreme, painfulone 
                big, discontinuous, shattering break. 
              </P><P>
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Totally wrong.
              </P><P> Here are the facts of life about these and other change myths. 
                Companies that make the change from good to great have no name 
                for their transformationand absolutely no program. They 
                neither rant nor rave about a crisisand they don't manufacture 
                one where none exists. They don't motivate peopletheir 
                people are self-motivated. Theres no evidence of a connection 
                between money and change mastery. And fear doesn't drive changebut 
                it does perpetuate mediocrity. Nor can acquisitions provide a 
                stimulus for greatness: Two mediocrities never make one great 
                company. Technology is certainly importantbut it comes into 
                play only after change has already begun. And as for the final 
                myth, dramatic results do not come from dramatic processnot 
                if you want them to last, anyway. A serious revolution, one that 
                feels like a revolution to those going through it, is highly unlikely 
                to bring about a <mark>sustainable</mark> leap from being good to being great. 
              </P><P> These myths became clear as my research team and I completed 
                a five-year project to determine what it takes to change a good 
                company into a great one. We systematically scoured a list of 
                1,435 established companies to find every extraordinary case that 
                made a leap from no-better-than-average results to great results. 
                How great? After the leap, a company had to generate cumulative 
                stock returns that exceeded the general stock market by at least 
                three times over 15 yearsand it had to be a leap independent 
                of its industry. In fact, the 11 good-to-great companies that 
                we found averaged returns 6.9 times greater than the marketsmore 
                than twice the performance rate of General Electric under the 
                legendary Jack Welch. 
              </P><P> The surprising good-to-great list included such unheralded companies 
                as Abbott Laboratories (3.98 times the market), Fannie Mae (7.56 
                times the market), <mark>Kimberly-Clark Corp.</mark>(3.42 times the market), 
                Nucor Corp. (5.16 times the market), and Wells Fargo (3.99 times 
                the market). One such surprise, the Kroger Co.a grocery 
                chainbumped along as a totally average performer for 80 
                years and then somehow broke free of its mediocrity to beat the 
                stock market by 4.16 times over the next 15 years. And it didn't 
                stop there. From 1973 to 1998, Kroger outperformed the market 
                by 10 times. 
              </P><P> In each of these dramatic, remarkable, good-to-great corporate 
                transformations, we found the same thing: There was no miracle 
                moment. Instead, a down-to-earth, pragmatic, committed-to-excellence 
                processa frameworkkept each company, its leaders, 
                and its people on track for the long haul. In each case, it was 
                the triumph of the <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html"">Flywheel Effect</A> over the Doom Loop, the victory 
                of steadfast discipline over the quick fix. And the real kicker: 
                The comparison companies in our studyfirms with virtually 
                identical opportunities during the pivotal yearsdid buy 
                into the change myths described aboveand failed to make 
                the leap from good to great.</P><H2 class=""articleLsTitle""><B>How 
                change doesn't happen
                </B></H2>Picture an egg. Day after day, it sits 
                there. No one pays attention to it. No one notices it. Certainly 
                no one takes a picture of it or puts it on the cover of a celebrity-focused 
                business magazine. Then one day, the shell cracks and out jumps 
                a chicken. 
        <P> All of a sudden, the major magazines and newspapers jump on 
                the story: Stunning Turnaround at Egg! and The 
                Chick Who Led the Breakthrough at Egg! From the outside, 
                the story always reads like an overnight sensationas if 
                the egg had suddenly and radically altered itself into a chicken. 
              </P><P>
Now picture the egg from the chicken's point of view. 
              </P><P> While the outside world was ignoring this seemingly dormant 
                egg, the chicken within was evolving, growing, developingchanging. 
                From the chickens point of view, the moment of breakthrough, 
                of cracking the egg, was simply one more step in a long chain 
                of steps that had led to that moment. Granted, it was a big stepbut 
                it was hardly the radical transformation that it looked like from 
                the outside. 
              </P><P> Its a silly analogy, but then our conventional way of 
                looking at change is no less silly. Everyone looks for the miracle 
                moment when change happens. But ask the good-to-great 
                executives when change happened. They cannot pinpoint a single 
                key event that exemplified their successful transition. 
              </P><P> Take Walgreens. For more than 40 years, Walgreens was no more 
                than an average company, tracking the general market. Then in 
                1975 (out of the blue!) Walgreens began to climb. And climb. And 
                climb. It just kept climbing. From December 31, 1975, to January 
                1, 2000, $1 invested in Walgreens beat $1 invested in Intel by 
                nearly two times, General Electric by nearly five times, and Coca-Cola 
                by nearly eight times. It beat the general stock market by more 
                than 15 times. 
                            </P><P> I asked a key Walgreens executive to pinpoint when the good-to-great 
                transformation happened. His answer: Sometime between 1971 
                and 1980. (Well, that certainly narrows it down!) 
              </P><P> Walgreenss experience is the norm for good-to-great performers. 
                Leaders at Abbott said, It wasn't a blinding flash or sudden 
                revelation from above. From Kimberly-Clark: These 
                things don't happen overnight. They grow. From Wells Fargo: 
                It wasn't a single switch that was thrown at one time.</P><P> We keep looking for change in the wrong places, asking the wrong 
                questions, and making the wrong assumptions. Theres even 
                a tendency to blame Wall Street for the instant results 
                approach to change. But the companies that made the jump from 
                good to great did so using Wall Street's own tough metric of success: 
                a sustained leap in their stock-market performance. Wall Street 
                turns out to be just another mythan excuse for not doing 
                what really works. The data doesnt lie. </P><H2 class=""articleLsTitle""><B>How 
                change does happen</B></H2>
                Now picture a huge, heavy flywheel. Its a massive, metal 
                disk mounted horizontally on an axle. It's about 100 feet in diameter, 
                10 feet thick, and it weighs about 25 tons. That flywheel is your 
                company. Your job is to get that flywheel to move as fast as possible, 
                because momentummass times velocityis what will generate 
                superior economic results over time.<P> Right now, the flywheel is at a standstill. To get it moving, 
                you make a tremendous effort. You push with all your might, and 
                finally you get the flywheel to inch forward. After two or three 
                days of sustained effort, you get the flywheel to complete one 
                entire turn. You keep pushing, and the flywheel begins to move 
                a bit faster. It takes a lot of work, but at last the flywheel 
                makes a second rotation. You keep pushing steadily. It makes three 
                turns, four turns, five, six. With each turn, it moves faster, 
                and thenat some point, you can't say exactly whenyou 
                break through. The momentum of the heavy wheel kicks in your favor. 
                It spins faster and faster, with its own weight propelling it. 
                You aren't pushing any harder, but the flywheel is accelerating, 
                its momentum building, its speed increasing. 
              </P><P> This is the <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html"">Flywheel Effect</A>. It's what it feels like when youre 
                inside a company that makes the transition from good to great. 
                Take Kroger, for example. How do you get a company with more than 
                50,000 people to embrace a new strategy that will eventually change 
                every aspect of every grocery store? You dont. At least 
                not with one big change program. 
        </P><P> Instead, you put your shoulder to the flywheel. Thats 
                what Jim Herring, the leader who initiated the transformation 
                of Kroger, told us. He stayed away from change programs and motivational 
                stunts. He and his team began turning the flywheel gradually, 
                consistentlybuilding tangible evidence that their plans 
                made sense and would deliver results. 
              </P><P>We presented what we were doing in such a way that people 
                saw our accomplishments,Herring says. We tried to 
                bring our plans to successful conclusions step by step, so that 
                the mass of people would gain confidence from the successes, not 
                just the words.</P><P> Think about it for one minute. Why do most overhyped change 
                programs ultimately fail? Because they lack accountability, they 
                fail to achieve credibility, and they have no authenticity. Its 
                the opposite of the <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html"">Flywheel Effect</A>; it's the Doom Loop. 
                            
        </P><P> Companies that fall into the Doom Loop genuinely want to effect 
                changebut they lack the quiet discipline that produces the 
                <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html"">Flywheel Effect</A>. Instead, they launch change programs with huge 
                fanfare, hoping to enlist the troops. They start down 
                one path, only to change direction. After years of lurching back 
                and forth, these companies discover that theyve failed to 
                build any sustained momentum. Instead of turning the flywheel, 
                they've fallen into a Doom Loop: Disappointing results lead to 
                reaction without understanding, which leads to a new directiona 
                new leader, a new programwhich leads to no momentum, which 
                leads to disappointing results. Its a steady, downward spiral. 
                Those who have experienced a Doom Loop know how it drains the 
                spirit right out of a company. 
        </P><P> Consider the Warner-Lambert Co.the company that we compared 
                directly with Gillettein the early 1980s. In 1979, Warner-Lambert 
                told <I>Business Week</I> that it aimed to be a leading consumer-products 
                company. One year later, it did an abrupt about-face and turned 
                its sights on healthcare. In 1981, the company reversed course 
                again and returned to diversification and consumer goods. Then 
                in 1987, Warner-Lambert made another U-turn, away from consumer 
                goods, and announced that it wanted to compete with Merck. Then 
                in the early 1990s, the company responded to government announcements 
                of pending healthcare reform and reembraced diversification and 
                consumer brands. 
              </P><P> Between 1979 and 1998, Warner-Lambert underwent three major 
                restructuringsone per CEO. Each new CEO arrived with his 
                own program; each CEO halted the momentum of his predecessor. 
                With each turn of the Doom Loop, the company spiraled further 
                downward, until it was swallowed by Pfizer in 2000. 
              </P><P> In contrast, why does the <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html"">Flywheel Effect</A> work? Because more 
                than anything else, real people in real companies want to be part 
                of a winning team. They want to contribute to producing real results. 
                They want to feel the excitement and the satisfaction of being 
                part of something that just flat-out works. When people begin 
                to feel the magic of momentumwhen they begin to see tangible 
                results and can feel the flywheel start to build speedthats 
                when they line up, throw their shoulders to the wheel, and push. 
        </P><P> And thats how change really happens. </P><H2 class=""articleLsTitle""><B>Disciplined 
                people: Who before what</B></H2>
                You are a bus driver. The bus, your company, is at a standstill, 
                and its your job to get it going. You have to decide where 
                you're going, how you're going to get there, and who's going with 
                you. 
              <P> Most people assume that great bus drivers (read: business leaders) 
                immediately start the journey by announcing to the people on the 
                bus where they're goingby setting a new direction or by 
                articulating a fresh corporate vision. 
              </P><P> In fact, leaders of companies that go from good to great start 
                not with where but with who. They start 
                by getting the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the 
                bus, and the right people in the right seats. And they stick with 
                that disciplinefirst the people, then the directionno 
                matter how dire the circumstances. Take David Maxwells bus 
                ride. When he became CEO of Fannie Mae in 1981, the company was 
                losing $1 million every business day, with $56 billion worth of 
                mortgage loans underwater. The board desperately wanted to know 
                what Maxwell was going to do to rescue the company. 
              </P><P> Maxwell responded to the what question the same 
                way that all good-to-great leaders do: He told them, Thats 
                the wrong first question. To decide where to drive the bus before 
                you have the right people on the bus, and the wrong people off 
                the bus, is absolutely the wrong approach. 
              </P><P> Maxwell told his management team that there would only be seats 
                on the bus for A-level people who were willing to put out A-plus 
                effort. He interviewed every member of the team. He told them 
                all the same thing: It was going to be a tough ride, a very demanding 
                trip. If they didnt want to go, fine; just say so. Nows 
                the time to get off the bus, he said. No questions asked, no recriminations. 
                In all, 14 of 26 executives got off the bus. They were replaced 
                by some of the best, smartest, and hardest-working executives 
                in the world of finance. 
              </P><P> With the right people on the bus, in the right seats, Maxwell 
                then turned his full attention to the what question. 
                He and his team took Fannie Mae from losing $1 million a day at 
                the start of his tenure to earning $4 million a day at the end. 
                Even after Maxwell left in 1991, his great team continued to drive 
                the flywheelturn upon turnand Fannie Mae generated 
                cumulative stock returns nearly eight times better than the general 
                market from 1984 to 1999. 
              </P><P> When it comes to getting started, good-to-great leaders understand 
                three simple truths. First, if you begin with who, 
                you can more easily adapt to a fast-changing world. If people 
                get on your bus because of where they think its going, you'll 
                be in trouble when you get 10 miles down the road and discover 
                that you need to change direction because the world has changed. 
                But if people board the bus principally because of all the other 
                great people on the bus, youll be much faster and smarter 
                in responding to changing conditions. Second, if you have the 
                right people on your bus, you dont need to worry about motivating 
                them. The right people are self-motivated: Nothing beats being 
                part of a team that is expected to produce great results. And 
                third, if you have the wrong people on the bus, nothing else matters. 
                You may be headed in the right direction, but you still wont 
                achieve greatness. Great vision with mediocre people still produces 
                mediocre results. </P><H2 class=""articleLsTitle""><B>Disciplined 
                thought: Fox or hedgehog?</B></H2>
                Picture two animals: a fox and a hedgehog. Which are you? An ancient 
                Greek parable distinguishes between foxes, which know many small 
                things, and hedgehogs, which know one big thing. All good-to-great 
                leaders, it turns out, are hedgehogs. They know how to simplify 
                a complex world into a single, organizing ideathe kind of 
                basic principle that unifies, organizes, and guides all decisions. 
                Thats not to say hedgehogs are simplistic. Like great thinkers, 
                who take complexities and boil them down into simple, yet profound, 
                ideas (Adam Smith and the invisible hand, Darwin and evolution), 
                leaders of good-to-great companies develop a <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html"">Hedgehog Concept</A> that is simple but that reflects penetrating insight and deep 
                understanding.
<P> What does it take to come up with a <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html"">Hedgehog Concept</A> for your 
                company? Start by <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/confront-the-brutal-facts.html"">confronting the brutal facts</A>. One good-to-great 
                CEO began by asking, Why have we sucked for 100 years? 
          That's brutaland it's precisely the type of disciplined 
                question necessary to ignite a transformation. The management 
                <mark>climate</mark> during a leap from good to great is like a searing scientific 
                debatewith smart, tough-minded people examining hard facts 
                and debating what those facts mean. The point isnt to win 
                the debate, but rather to come up with the best answersand, 
                ultimately, to lock onto a <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html"">Hedgehog Concept</A> that works. 
        </P><P> Youll know that youre getting closer to your <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html"">Hedgehog 
                Concept</A> when you align three intersecting circles that represent 
                three pivotal questions: What can we be the best in the world 
                at? (And equally importantwhat can we not be the best at?) 
                What is the economic denominator that best drives our economic 
                engine (profit or cash flow per x)? And what are our 
                core people deeply passionate about? Answer those three questions 
                honestly, facing the brutal facts without blinking, and youll 
                begin to see your <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html"">Hedgehog Concept</A> emerge. 
        </P><P> For example, before Wells Fargo understood its <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html"">Hedgehog Concept</A>, 
                its leaders had tried to make it a global bank: It operated like 
                a mini-Citicorpand a mediocre one at that. 
              </P><P> Then the Wells Fargo team asked itself, What can we potentially 
                do better than any other company? The brutal fact was that 
                Wells Fargo would never be the best global bank in the worldand 
                so the leadership team pulled the plug on the vast majority of 
                the banks international operations. When the team asked 
                the question about the banks economic engine, Wells Fargos 
                leaders confronted a second brutal fact: In a deregulated world, 
                commercial banking would be a commodity. The essential economic 
                driver would no longer be profit per loan, but profit per employee. 
                The bank switched its operations to become a pioneering leader 
                in electronic banking and to open utilitarian branches run by 
                small crews of superb people. Profit per employee skyrocketed. 
                Finally, when it came to passion, members of the Wells Fargo team 
                all agreed: The mindless waste and self-awarded perks of traditional 
                banking culture were revolting. They proudly saw themselves as 
                stoic Spartans in an industry that had been dominated by the wasteful, 
                elitist culture of banking. The Wells Fargo team eventually translated 
                the three circles into a simple, crystalline <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html"">Hedgehog Concept:</A> Run a bank like a business, with a focus on the western United 
                States, and consistently increase profit per employee. Run 
                it like a business and run it like you own it 
                became mantras; simplicity and focus made all the difference. 
                With fanatical adherence to that simple idea, Wells Fargo made 
                the leap from good results to superior results. 
        </P><P> In the journey from good to great, defining your Hedgehog Concept 
                is an essential element. But insight and understanding dont 
                happen overnightor after one off-site. On average, it took 
                four years for the good-to-great companies to crystallize their 
                <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html"">Hedgehog Concepts</A>. It was an inherently iterative processconsisting 
                of piercing questions, vigorous debate, resolute action, and autopsies 
                without blamea cycle repeated over and over by the right 
                people, infused with the brutal facts, and guided by the three 
                circles. This is the chicken inside the egg. </P><H2 class=""articleLsTitle""><B>Disciplined action: 
                The stop doing list
                </B></H2>
                Take a look at your desk. If youre like most hard-charging 
                leaders, youve got a well-articulated to-do list. Now take 
                another look: Wheres your stop-doing list? We've all been 
                told that leaders make things happenand that's true: Pushing 
                that flywheel takes a lot of concerted effort. But its also 
                true that good-to-great leaders distinguish themselves by their 
                unyielding discipline to stop doing anything and everything that 
                doesn't fit tightly within their <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html"">Hedgehog Concept</A>.
<P> When Darwin Smith and his management team crystallized the <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html"">Hedgehog 
                Concept</A> for Kimberly-Clark, they faced a dilemma. On one hand, 
                they understood that the best path to greatness lay in the consumer 
                business, where the company had demonstrated a best-in-the-world 
                capability in its building of the Kleenex brand. On the other 
                hand, the vast majority of Kimberly-Clarks revenue lay in 
                traditional coated-paper mills, turning out paper for magazines 
                and writing padswhich had been the core business of the 
                company for 100 years. Even the company's namesake townKimberly, 
                Wisconsinwas built around a Kimberly-Clark paper mill. 
        </P><P> Yet the brutal truth remained: The consumer business was the 
                one arena that best met the three-circle test. If Kimberly-Clark 
                remained principally a paper-mill business, it would retain a 
                secure position as a good company. But its only shot at becoming 
                a great company was to become the best paper-based consumer companyif 
                it could take on such companies as Procter &amp; Gamble and Scott 
                Paper Co. and beat them. That meant it would have to stop 
                doing paper mills. 
              </P><P> So, in what one director called the gutsiest decision 
                I've ever seen a CEO make, Darwin Smith sold the mills. 
                He even sold the mill in Kimberly, Wisconsin. Then he threw all 
                the money into a war chest for an epic battle with Procter &amp; Gamble 
                and Scott Paper. Wall Street analysts derided the move, and the 
                business press called it stupid. But Smith did not waver. 
              </P><P>
Twenty-five years later, Kimberly-Clark emerged from the fray as the number-one paper-based consumer-products company in the world, beating P&amp;G in six of eight categories and owning its former archrival Scott Paper outright. For the shareholder, Kimberly-Clark under Darwin Smith beat the market by four times, easily outperforming such great companies as Coca-Cola, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, and 3M. 
              </P><P> In deciding what not to do, Smith gave the flywheel a gigantic 
                pushbut it was only one push. After selling the mills, Kimberly-Clarks 
                full transformation required thousands of additional pushes, big 
                and small, accumulated one after another. It took years to gain 
                enough momentum for the press to herald Kimberly-Clarks 
                shift from good to great. One magazine wrote, When ... Kimberly-Clark 
                decided to go head to head against P&amp;G ... this magazine predicted 
                disaster. What a dumb idea. As it turns out, it wasn't a dumb 
                idea. It was a smart idea. The amount of time between the 
                two articles: 21 years. </P><H2 class=""articleLsTitle""><B>Now 
                it begins</B></H2>
                Our study of what it takes to turn good into great required five 
                yearsand 10.5 person-yearsand amounted to our own 
                flywheel effort. Looking back on our research, whats most 
                striking to me about our findings is the absence of a magic moment 
                in any of the good-to-great companiesor in our own journey 
                to understanding. The real path to greatness, it turns out, requires 
                simplicity and diligence. It requires clarity, not instant illumination. 
                It demands each of us to focus on what is vitaland to eliminate 
                all of the extraneous distractions. 
              <P> After five years of research, Im absolutely convinced 
                that if we just focus our attention on the right thingsand 
                stop doing the senseless things that consume so much time and 
                energywe can create a powerful <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html"">Flywheel Effect</A> without increasing 
                the number of hours we work. 
        </P><P> Im also convinced that the good-to-great findings apply 
                broadlynot just to CEOs but also to you and me in whatever 
                work were engaged in, including the work of our own lives. 
                For many people, the first question that occurs is, But 
                how do I persuade my CEO to get it? My answer: Don't worry 
                about that. Focus instead on resultson subverting mediocrity 
                by creating a <A href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html"">Flywheel Effect</A> within your own span of responsibility. 
                So long as we can choose the people we want to put on our own 
                minibus, each of us can create a pocket of greatness. Each of 
                us can take our own area of work and influence and can concentrate 
                on moving it from good to great. It doesnt really matter 
                whether all the CEOs get it. It only matters that you and I do. 
                Now, its time to get to work.

                Can a good company become a great company? How? It took Jim Collins 
                and his team of researchers five years to come up with the answers: 
                11 companies made the leap from good to great and then sustained 
                those results for at least 15 years. How great was great? The 
                good-to-great companies averaged cumulative stock returns 6.9 
                times the general market in the 15 years after their transition 
                points. The actual screening-and-selection process was a rigorous 
                one. The criteria were: 
              <P> 1. The company had to show a pattern of good performance, punctuated 
                by a transition point, after which it shifted to great performance. 
                Great performance was defined as a cumulative total 
                stock return of at least three times the general market for the 
                period from the transition point through 15 years. 
              </P><P>
2. The transition from good to great had to be company specific, not an industrywide event. 
              </P><P> 3. The company had to be an established and ongoing enterprisenot a 
                startup. It had to have been in business for at least 25 years 
                prior to its transition, and it had to have been publicly traded 
                with stock-return data available for at least 10 years prior to 
                its transition. 
              </P><P>
4. The transition point had to occur before 1985 to give the team enough data to assess the sustainability of the transition.
</P><P>
5. Whatever the year of transition, the company had to be a significant, ongoing, stand-alone company.
</P><P>
6. At the time of its selection, the company still had to show an upward trend. 
</P><P>
The study began with a field of 1,435 companies and emerged with a list of 11 good-to-great companies: Abbott Laboratories, Circuit City, Fannie Mae, Gillette Co., <mark>Kimberly-Clark Corp.</mark>, the Kroger Co., Nucor Corp., Philip Morris Cos. Inc., Pitney Bowes Inc., Walgreens, and Wells Fargo. 
              </P><P> The next step in the study was to isolate what it took to make 
                the change. At this point, each of the 11 good-to-great companies 
                was paired with a comparison companya company with similar 
                attributes that could have made the transition, but didnt. 
              </P><P> Then the research began. Collins and his team reviewed books, 
                articles, case studies, and annual reports covering each company; 
                examined financial analyses for each company, totaling 980 combined 
                years of data; conducted 84 interviews with senior managers and 
                board members of the companies; scrutinized the personal and professional 
                records of 56 CEOs; analyzed compensation plans for the companies; 
                and reviewed layoffs, corporate ownership, media hype, 
                and the role of technology for the companies. The findings are 
                contained in <I>Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap 
                ... And Others Don't</I> (HarperBusiness, 2001).</P><H2><B><SPAN class=""bodyHeader"">Sidebar: 
                Great answers to good questions</SPAN></B></H2><H2 class=""bodyHeader""><B>Fast Company:</B></H2> The CEOs who took their companies from good 
                to great were largely anonymous. Is that an accident? 
              <P><B>Jim Collins:</B> There is a direct relationship between the 
                absence of celebrity and the presence of good-to-great results. 
                Why? First, when you have a celebrity, the company turns into 
                the one genius with 1,000 helpers. It creates a sense 
                that the whole thing is really about the CEO. At a deeper level, 
                we found that for leaders to make something great, their ambition 
                has to be for the greatness of the work and the company, rather 
                than for themselves. That doesnt mean that they dont 
                have an ego. It means that at each decision pointat each 
                of the critical junctures when Choice A would favor their ego 
                and Choice B would favor the company and the worktime and 
                again the good-to-great leaders pick Choice B. Celebrity CEOs, 
                at those same decision points, are more likely to favor self and 
                ego over company and work. 
              </P><P><B>FC:</B> Like the anonymous CEOs, most of the good-to-great companies are unheralded. What does that tell us?
              </P><P><B>JC:</B> The truth is, few people are working on the most 
                glamorous things in the world. Most of them are doing real workwhich 
                means that most of the time theyre doing a heck of a lot 
                of drudgery with only a few moments of excitement. The real work 
                of the economy gets done by people who make cars, who sell real 
                estate, and who run grocery stores or banks. One of the great 
                findings of this study is that you can be in a great company and 
                be doing it in steel, in drug stores, or in grocery stores. No 
                one has the right to whine about their company, their industry, 
                or the kind of business that they're inever again. 
              </P><P><B>FC:</B> Lets say that Im not running a company. 
                How do the good-to-great lessons apply to me? 
              </P><P><B>JC:</B> The basic message is this: Build your own flywheel. You can do it. You can start to build momentum in something for which you've got responsibility. You can build a great department. You can build a great church community. You can take every one of these ideas and apply them to your own work or your own life.
</P><P><B>FC:</B> What does your research suggest about the best way to respond to the current economic slowdown?
              </P><P><B>JC:</B> If I were running a company today, I would have one 
                priority above all others: to acquire as many of the best people 
                as I could. Id put off everything else to fill my bus. Because 
                things are going to come back. My flywheel is going to start to 
                turn. And the single biggest constraint on the success of my organization 
                is the ability to get and to hang on to enough of the right people.</P></DIV><DIV id=""article_copyright"">Copyright © 2001 Jim Collins, All rights reserved.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The series explains the reasons for, and implications of an ambitious forest conservation target:<STRONG> <A href=""/our_work/forests/"">Zero Net Deforestation and Forest Degradation</A></STRONG> (<STRONG>ZNDD</STRONG>) by 2020.
It is a target that reflects the scale and urgency with which threats to the world's forest and <mark>climate</mark> need to be tackled.   <H2>The Living Forests Model</H2>
To understand what ZNDD would mean in practice, WWF developed the Living Forests Model with the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), which forms the basis for the Living Forests Report.
The model allows us to explore various global land-use scenarios. It calculates the effect of forces such as population growth and consumer demand, and describes possible consequences on key areas such as food production, <mark>climate change</mark>, biodiversity, commodity prices and economic development. 
The Living Forests Model finds that achieving ZNDD is both possible and urgent. But it will not be easy. <H2>Download the chapters:</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""right-column""><DIV class=""container col4 image aside highlight""><DIV class=""image-caption""><DIV class=""container""><DIV class=""caption hover"">Deforestation fronts - places that will account for over 80% of the forest loss projected globally by 2030</DIV></DIV><DIV class=""meta""><SPAN class=""copyright"">© WWF</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""container col4 quote aside""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""bodytext""><P>WWF's analysis of global deforestation trends highlights where we can expect to witness the loss of forests in the coming decades, and what will cause this.

Throughout the 1990s, Nike was targeted by labor activists, campus organizers and anti-globalization forces for allowing its suppliers in poor countries to abuse and exploit workers. </P><P>At first, Nike said it couldn’t be responsible for conditions in factories it didn’t own. Protests and media reports proliferated. In 1996, Life magazine published a story headlined “<A href=""http://www.laborrights.org/in-the-news/six-cents-hour"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Six Cents an Hour,</A>” with a photo of a Pakistani boy sewing Nike soccer balls.</P><P>Phil Knight, who was then CEO, promised reform <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/13/business/international-business-nike-pledges-to-end-child-labor-and-apply-us-rules-abroad.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">in a 1998 speech</A>. “The Nike product has become synonymous with slave wages, forced overtime and arbitrary abuse,” he said. “I truly believe that the American consumer does not want to buy products made in abusive conditions.” </P><P>It was slow in coming but Nike eventually set up an extensive and expensive system for monitoring and remedying factory conditions in its supply chain – and the rest of the footwear and apparel industry followed.</P><P>Today, <A href=""http://www.apple.com."" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Nike</A> is a corporate-sustainability leader. “Our greatest responsibility as a global company”, <A href=""http://about.nike.com/pages/sustainability"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">it says</A>, “Is to play a role in bringing about positive, systemic change for workers within our supply chain and in the industry”. On <A href=""http://www.fairlabor.org/affiliate/nike-inc"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">the website of the Fair Labor Asociation,</A> a coalition of brands, colleges and NGOs, Nike makes public inspection reports from its contract factories.</P><P>Some factories in poor countries still abuse workers, of course, but the Nike campaign transformed the debate about who’s responsible, and how to make improvements.</P><H2><STRONG>Kimberly Clark</STRONG></H2><P>For five years, <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greenpeace"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Greenpeace</A> campaigned against Kimberly Clark, which makes Kleenex, Scott tissues, Huggies and Pull-Ups, accusing the company of destroying old-growth forests for throwaway products.</P><P>When they made peace in 2009, Greenpeace produced <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a5OTPf2um8"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""><STRONG>a clever video</STRONG></A> to mark the reconciliation. Today, K-C and Greenpeace continue to collaborate.</P><P>Lisa Morden, K-C’s senior director of global sustainability, says the company was moving towards sourcing more recycled and certified fiber before the activists came along, but the campaign “really did accelerate our work and our progress”. Kimberly Clark turned around when it faced defections from campus customers and reputational damage. “It was becoming challenging, commercially, for us,” Morden says.</P><P>K-C increased its use of environmentally-preferred fiber, which includes recycled and Forest Stewardship Council-certified fiber, from 54 to 83% in its global tissue-products. Richard Brooks, director of the Canadian forest program for Greenpeace, says the company’s actions have “had a ripple effect on other companies in the tissue-product sector”. For example, Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes Bounty, Charmin and Puffs, exceeded its fiber-purchasing goals a year ahead of schedule by achieving Forest Stewardship Certification for 54% of the virgin fiber used in its tissue. </P><P>Last fall, Greenpeace Canada launched a campaign accusing Best Buy of buying paper from Resolute Forest Products, the largest and most controversial logging company in Canada, according to Brooks.

The study’s core scenario (cited by Trump) falsely reports a GDP loss of trillions by 2040 due to the Paris Agreement.

World Wildlife Fund had a few questions for Stewart Van Horn, Kimberly-Clark’s Director of Global Sustainability – Energy Solutions, about why renewable energy is a priority.</EM><STRONG>Why is Kimberly-Clark pursuing renewable energy?</STRONG>Within Kimberly-Clark’s Energy &amp; <mark>Climate</mark> strategy, we deploy both energy conservation and alternative energy programs to minimize <mark>climate change</mark> impacts, reduce GHG emissions and transform our financial performance. We believe that increasing our use of renewable energy is not just good for the environment, it complements our existing efforts to drive <mark>innovation</mark> in energy management that creates value for our business.Power generation from renewable sources like wind is not affected by fluctuating costs for fuel such as natural gas. The fixed prices that come with a renewable energy PPA help reduce Kimberly-Clark’s exposure to volatility in the energy markets, and the potential savings generated by our energy efficiency and conservation projects reduces our operating costs and frees up funds to invest in the growth of our brands and businesses.<STRONG>You just signed two wind PPAs, which combined is one of the biggest PPA announcements of any company to date. What impact does this have on your footprint?</STRONG>The impact on our footprint will be significant. The power purchase agreements (PPAs) are a step-change in our energy and <mark>climate</mark> strategy helping us reduce <mark>climate change</mark> impacts and benefit cost savings for our business. These agreements mark Kimberly-Clark’s first use of utility-scale renewable energy. The 245 megawatts of wind-generated electricity supplied under these agreements is equivalent to about one-third of the electricity needed to power our North American manufacturing operations.The renewable power supplied by these agreements will enable Kimberly-Clark to offset around 550,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, effectively reducing the company’s market-based emissions by 11%. Adding wind-generated electricity to the energy mix will enable the company to achieve more than a 25 percent reduction in GHG emissions in 2018, which is four years ahead of the original 2022 target to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 2005 levels.<STRONG>You came to <A href=""http://rebuyers.org/"">REBA’s</A> first meeting last year.  How did that set you on a renewables journey?</STRONG>The insights we gained from the 2016 REBA meeting informed our plans to increase the role of renewable energy in achieving our <mark>climate</mark> goals.  We used the <A href=""http://buyersprinciples.org/"">Renewable Energy Buyers Principles</A> when evaluating the business case for pursuing our first utility-scale renewable energy agreements.  We have now formally signed on to the Renewable Energy Buyers Principles and have endorsed REBA’s effort to simplify and streamline the way businesses purchase renewable energy, which will support further investment and development of wind power and other renewables. <STRONG>Where will you go from here?</STRONG>Our original 2022 absolute GHG reduction goal of 20 percent was location-based, that is, based on driving actual GHG reductions in our operations through energy conservation, increased operating efficiency and on-site alternative energy projects. We’re now in the process of setting a new market-based emissions baseline and emissions reduction target incorporating the benefits of the renewable energy credits from virtual power purchase agreements.Kimberly-Clark will continue to evaluate alternative energy sources including renewables as part of our ongoing efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiency and reduce costs.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""span3""><DIV class=""big-separator-bottom gutter-top-in-fixed-2 gutter-bottom-in-fixed-2 gutter-horiz-in""><FORM action=""/blogs/sustainability-works"" accept-charset=""UTF-8"" method=""get""><DIV class=""form-inline""><LABEL for=""terms"" class=""screen-reader"">Search the Sustainability Works blog</LABEL><BUTTON type=""submit""><SPAN class=""screen-reader""><SPAN class=""translation_missing"" title=""translation missing: en.blogs.search"">Search</SPAN></SPAN><I class=""ico ico-search"" aria-hidden=""true"">w</I></BUTTON></DIV></FORM></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Operated by Renovate America, the HERO Program is a Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing program that partners with local governments to make energy-efficient, water-saving, and renewable energy products more accessible for homeowners. PACE, enacted by California legislation, provides 100 percent financing at rates competitive to a home equity line of credit for projects that save energy and water. Since the projects are permanently affixed to the home and financed through local property taxes, any remaining balance may be able to be transferred to a buyer if the home is sold.

These involve investing in social programmes, reducing the company’s environmental footprint and innovating to extend the life of its products and packaging materials.  </P><P>The company has just concluded its Sustainability 2015 strategy, of which key achievements in Asia Pacific include a 40 per cent reduction in absolute water consumption and a 15 per cent reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions (both against a 2010 baseline) for the business.</P><P>Ninety-five per cent of manufacturing waste has also been diverted from landfills in 2015, which Morden adds, puts the company on track towards achieving a 99 percent reduction in landfill usage by 2016.</P><P>This year is the start of a new strategy called Sustainability 2022, Morden shares, which is developed with a very different mindset from previous programmes.</P><P>“We broke our five-year cycle to commit to a seven-year strategy because in 2022, Kimberly-Clark will be 150 years old. We thought it was a great connection to sustainability – the (number of) years we have been operating shows how <mark>sustainable</mark> we have been. We’ve been here for 150 years and hopefully 150 more,” she says.</P><P>Under Sustainability 2022, Kimberly-Clark will be focusing on targets and programmes around energy and <mark>climate</mark>, fiber sourcing and responsible forest management, waste and the circular economy, as well as corporate social compliance – ranging from eradicating forced labour and water security to access to sanitation.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><H2 class=""quote"">“</H2><P><SPAN>Sustainability needs to be an integral part of the business and not something that happens on the side or as a social responsibility activity.</SPAN></P><P class=""quote-credit""><SPAN><SPAN>Lisa Morden, </SPAN>senior director of global sustainability, Kimberly-Clark</SPAN></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>“We constantly look at how our business impacts the environment and communities around us,” says Morden, who was in Singapore recently for a meeting with Kimberly-Clark’s Sustainability Advisory Board (SAB).</P><P>Formed seven years ago, the board consists of six members including high-profile academic, Jo Mackness, of the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business;  chief executive Sally Uren from non-profit Forum for the Future; and Andrew Winston, Fortune 500 advisor and author of books “Green to Gold” and “The Big Pivot”.</P><P>Typically meeting twice a year, the board provides Kimberly-Clark regular and relevant insights on potential risks and opportunities for the business.</P><P>This year, Kimberly-Clark is focusing its attention on Asia by having its SAB members converge outside of North America for the first time. They spent a week in Singapore with business leaders across Asia Pacific, and took a day out of their schedule for a visit to a pulp mill in Kluang, Malaysia to better understand the facility’s environmental objectives.</P><P>With the SAB members predominantly based in the Americas and Europe, the visit to Asia was crucial for them to deepen their understanding of the business perspectives and consumer expectations in the region, says Morden.</P><P>Kimberly-Clark is also looking to recruit a new board member who can speak on behalf of Asia.</P><P>“Geographical representation is what we think about when we screen individuals for the SAB ,” she says.</P><H4><SPAN>Conversations in Asia</SPAN></H4><P>Morden has been with Kimberly-Clark for over 20 years, beginning her career in a pulp mill in Canada and subsequently taking on regional and global responsibilities across different product categories and departments.</P><P>She is now responsible for creating a sustainability strategy to support  Kimberly-Clark’s business plans. This includes setting specific and quantifiable goals – from workplace safety in the mills to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and reducing the waste sent to landfills – and communicating the progress both internally and to the greater public.</P><P>Kimberly-Clark has operations in 12 countries across Asia Pacific, including 19 mills and 14,000 employees. As of end 2015, the region contributed US$4 billion out of the company’s total global revenue of US$18 billion.</P><P>As countries in Asia are at different stages of economic growth and sustainability awareness, Kimberly-Clark has to cater its business and communications strategy to each market.</P><P>Some of the company’s efforts to differentiate its products include clearly-labelled FSC packaging at point-of-sale displays in Taiwan, and collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) through public relations and TV advertisements and online engagement for the Indonesian market, shares Morden.</P><P>“The diversity of perspectives in the region is driven by several factors – local policy and regulations, consumer trends and behavior, among others – that cause our teams to land in specific strategic orientations around sustainability,” she says.</P><P>But one challenge that has emerged for all of Kimberly-Clark’s markets is to get consumers more actively engaged in conversations on sustainability.</P><P>“We don’t see consumers everywhere wanting to participate in our conversations, because different markets have different consumer needs and interests,” she notes.</P><P>Encouragingly, however, her regional leadership teams have observed growing consumer interest in recent years, due to the influence from government policies, corporate sector pressure, and media attention.</P><P>From global leaders making <mark>climate change</mark> pledges under the historic Paris Agreement to celebrities taking a more vocal stance against irresponsible business practices, the awareness of sustainability issues globally have been on the rise.</P><P> “This is the time we can really think about some disruptive, innovative ways to get around some of these big sustainability issues,” she says.</P><H4><SPAN>Seeing the value</SPAN></H4><P>Kimberly-Clark’s efforts in being socially and environmentally responsible through the years have paid off in more ways than one.</P><P>It has observed tangible results from its sustainability initiatives, such as cost savings associated with energy conservation, reduction in water consumption, and cutting down its use of fiber and packaging.</P><P>Being one of the early adopters of FSC has also helped enhance Kimberly-Clark’s reputation and differentiate its line of products from the other brands on retail shelves.</P><P>The most visible result of its sustainability efforts, however, lies in talent acquisition and retention, where Kimberly-Clark is consistently seen as an employer of choice in many parts of the world, says Morden.</P><P>“I often have new employees at various levels of the organisation approach me and say that the work we do in sustainability and the importance we place on it is why they find it appealing to work at Kimberly-Clark,” she says.</P><P>But while companies may be eager to adopt sustainability practices purely to gain a competitive advantage, Morden advises that companies operating in this age of information and enhanced scrutiny should first understand that sustainability practices have to be incorporated into the business as a whole to be viewed credibly.</P><P>“Sustainability needs to be an integral part of the business and not something that happens on the side or as a social responsibility activity,” she adds.</P><P><EM><EM>This article was first published on <A href=""https://www.futurereadysingapore.com/2016/kimberly-clark-why-sustainability-matters.html"" target=""_blank"">Future Ready Singapore</A>.

	5 August 2009Canada's precious Boreal Forest is better conserved today. So are ancient forests around the world.At a joint news conference in Washington DC, Greenpeace and the <mark>Kimberly-Clark Corpo</mark>ration, the world’s largest tissue-product manufacturer, announced an historic agreement that will ensure greater protection and <mark>sustainable</mark> management of Canada's Boreal Forest. The agreement also will stand out as a model for forest-products companies worldwide.

        </P></DIV></DIV><H2>Protection for the Boreal Forest in Canada</H2><P>Canada's Boreal Forest is North America's largest ancient forest and provides habitat for threatened wildlife such as woodland caribou, wolverine and over one billion migratory birds. The new agreement ensures that Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex-brand products, will no longer be purchasing pulp from the three million hectare Kenogami and Ogoki Forests in northern Ontario unless strict ecological criteria are met. These two areas within key zones of intact forest have been at the center of Greenpeace's Kleercut campaign.</P><P>As part of the agreement, Greenpeace announced that its nearly five-year-long Kleercut campaign against Kimberly-Clark is ended.</P><H2>The campaign in time</H2><DIV class=""greyright grayright"" style=""border: 1px dotted #66cc00; margin: 5px; float: right; width: 175px;""><DIV style=""padding: 5px;""><H3 style=""padding: 5px 0px; background: #339900 none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; color: #ffffff; text-align: center;"">Greenpeace quotes from the news conference in Washington, DC:</H3><P>&quot;Today's announcement shows that perseverance and dedication can achieve great environmental victories even after many years of campaigning.&quot;</P><P>&quot;We're gone from conflict and controversy to collaboration and this new policy is a first product of the new relationship we have with Kimberly-Clark.&quot;</P><P>&quot;I am looking forward to working with Kimberly-Clark on the full implementation of this policy. Because of Kimberly-Clark's size - it uses more than 4.5 million tonnes of fibre and pulp each year to make it products -, this new policy will have a profound effect on the global forest products industry.&quot;</P><P>&quot;I expect to a large ripple effect from this policy and its implementation for years to come. We have moved a mountain and that is going to have impacts around the world.&quot;</P><P>-Richard Brooks, Greenpeace Canada's forest campaign coordinator</P><P>The news conference was held at Washington DC.</P><P>Major news outlets from Canada and the United States attended.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><P>The success of the discussions between Greenpeace and Kimberly-Clark means a movement away from conflict to a new collaborative relationship to further promote forest conservation, responsible forest management, and the use of recycled fiber for the manufacture of tissue products.</P><H2>The power of activists and market pressure</H2><P>Greenpeace's Kleercut campaign was launched in November 2004.</P><P>This campaign to help protect ancient forests in Canada and globally applied pressure on the company via the marketplace and its large customers and consumers. In order to highlight the issue, hundreds of protests took place globally, resulting in more than 50 activists arrested in acts of peaceful civil disobedience. Scientific and exposé reports, media mobilization and shareholder engagement were also an important part of the campaign.</P><P>This work and dedication reached a successful conclusion with Kimberly-Clark's release of the strongest paper policy by one of the world's top three tissue product manufacturers.</P><H2>Greenpeace's second major forest success this year</H2><P>The agreement with Kimberly-Clark is the second major victory this year for Greenpeace's forest campaign. At the end of March, Greenpeace celebrated an enormous success- the protection of the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia. It is the most comprehensive rainforest conservation plan in North America and protects an area nearly the size of Belgium.</P><P>The success was the direct result of a decade-long campaign that thousands of Greenpeace supporters joined.</P><H2>Implementing the Kimberly-Clark policy</H2><P>Implementation of the policy will lead to protection of the world's most endangered forests, increased support for <mark>sustainable</mark> forest management through Forest Stewardship Council certification and the increased use of recycled fiber in Kimberly-Clark products.</P><P>During the evolution of this policy, Kimberly-Clark stopped buying more than 325,000 tonnes of pulp a year from logging operations in the Kenogami and Ogoki Forests. The company managing these forests was unwilling to protect endangered forest areas in them and supply Kimberly-Clark with Forest Stewardship Council certified pulp.</P><H2>The Boreal Forest and <mark>climate change</mark></H2><P>Protection of the Boreal Forest is crucial to world efforts to stop <mark>climate change</mark>. This forest is the largest terrestrial storehouse of <mark>carbon</mark> on the planet, storing 27 years worth of greenhouse gas emissions or 186 billion tonnes. If this <mark>carbon</mark> is released into the atmosphere it will add to the threat of catastrophic <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Under the policy Kimberly-Clark has set a goal of ensuring that 100 per cent of the fibre used in its products will be from environmentally responsible sources. It will greatly increase its use of recycled fibre and fibre from forest certified to Forest Stewardship Council standards. By 2011, it will also increase the use of recycled and FSC fibre [from North America sources] to 40 per cent from 29.7 per cent in 2007. By 2012, the company will no longer use pulp from the Boreal Forest unless is it certified to the standards of the <A href=""~/link/06966a9178404acaae14dc97fee7ed50.aspx?epslanguage=en-CA""> Forest Stewardship Council.</A></P><P>The full policy and its annex can be <A href=""/canada/en/documents-and-links/publications/the-policy-of-kimberly-clark/""> downloaded here</A></P><P>Please join us in thanking Kimberly-Clark for supporting conservation of the Boreal Forest by sending its CEO a <A href=""https://secure3.convio.net/gpeace/site/Advocacy?pagename=homepage&amp;page=UserAction&amp;id=493""> congratulations email</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

Kimberly-Clark has also made a foray into the medical world with Kimberly-Clark Health Care, providing hygiene and sanitary products for health care professionals. Part of the success is driven by KMB's thorough consumer research, which includes home visits and shopping trips with consumers to better understand purchase decisions. 
</P><P>Based in Dallas, Texas, Kimberly-Clark has operations all over the world, selling its products in over 150 countries.  It employees around 55,000 individuals at numerous locations.
</P><H2><SPAN class=""mw-headline"">Business Segments</SPAN></H2><P>Kimberly-Clark operates into following four operating business segments. These business segments are based on product groupings.
</P><UL><LI><B>Personal Care (43.7% of net sales, 61.6% of operating profit <SUP id=""_ref-ar2_0"" class=""reference""><A href=""#_note-ar2"" title="""">[2]</A></SUP>)</B>: The Personal Care segment manufactures and markets disposable diapers, training and youth pants, and swimpants; baby wipes; feminine and incontinence care products; and related products. Products in this segment are primarily for household use and are sold under a variety of brand names, including Huggies, Pull-Ups, Little Swimmers, GoodNites, Kotex, Lightdays, Depend, Poise and other brand names.
</LI><LI><B>Consumer Tissue (33.5% of net sales, 26.1% of operating profit <SUP id=""_ref-ar2_1"" class=""reference""><A href=""#_note-ar2"" title="""">[2]</A></SUP>)</B>: The Consumer Tissue segment manufactures and markets facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins and related products for household use. Products in this segment are sold under the Kleenex, Scott, Cottonelle, Viva, Andrex, Scottex, Hakle, Page and other brand names.
</LI><LI><B>K-C Professional &amp; Other (15.7% of net sales, 16.4% of operating profit <SUP id=""_ref-ar2_2"" class=""reference""><A href=""#_note-ar2"" title="""">[2]</A></SUP>)</B>: The K-C Professional &amp; Other segment manufactures and markets facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins, wipers and a range of safety products for the away-from-home marketplace. Products in this segment are sold under the Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex, Scott, WypAll, Kimtech, Kleenguard and Kimcare brand names.  This division was the only segment to post a fall in operating profit margin in the first quarter of 2009.  Analysts say the division is struggling with the <A href=""/wiki/U.S._Economic_Cycles"" title=""U.S. Economic Cycles"">economic downturn</A> because its customers include many restaurants and food service businesses. <SUP id=""_ref-1"" class=""reference""><A href=""#_note-1"" title="""">[3]</A></SUP></LI><LI><B>Health Care (8.7% of net sales, 8.6% of operating profit <SUP id=""_ref-ar2_3"" class=""reference""><A href=""#_note-ar2"" title="""">[2]</A></SUP>):</B> The Health Care segment manufactures and markets health care products such as surgical gowns, drapes, infection control products, sterilization wrap, disposable face masks and exam gloves, respiratory products and other disposable medical products. Products in this segment are sold under the Kimberly-Clark, Ballard and other brand names.
</LI></UL><H2><SPAN class=""mw-headline"">Trends and Forces</SPAN></H2><H3><SPAN class=""mw-headline""> Raw Materials and Regulation </SPAN></H3><P>In addition to oil, Kimberly-Clark relies very heavily on other natural resources, namely trees from which it produces its paper products.  The price of lumber is at the mercy of many forces, few of which can be controlled by Kimberly-Clark, and so this creates further uncertainty about the cost of production which once again creates uncertainty about revenue.  Some factors include:
</P><H4><SPAN class=""mw-headline""><mark>Climate Change</mark>s</SPAN></H4><P>Severe storms, droughts, and other weather phenomena effect the price of lumber.  If severe weather occurs, growing seasons could be reduced, not as much lumber could be available, and this could raise the cost of lumber.  A rise in the cost of lumber would decrease revenue margins, hurting Kimberly-Clark’s profits.
</P><H4><SPAN class=""mw-headline"">Government Regulations</SPAN></H4><P>There are strict regulations in developed (and some developing) countries about lumber harvesting.  Only a certain number of trees can be taken and a certain number must be replanted.  As regulations increase, the cost of lumber also increases, and in some cases the supply of lumber could be decreased.  In the long run, regulation ensures that there will always be lumber, but if less is available it will cost more, once again driving up the cost of raw materials for Kimberly-Clark. 
</P><H4><SPAN class=""mw-headline"">Environmental Sensitivity</SPAN></H4><P>Over the past few years, Kimberly-Clark has received negative attention from environmental activists at Greenpeace who claim that the company is cutting down ancient growth forests. The Kleercut campaign aims to smear Kimberly-Clark's reputation, and in some areas this has effected Kimberly-Clark's image and sales. The company is combating the campaign by claiming it is using <mark>sustainable</mark> methods and banning lumber harvesting on the Pacific Coast.  Furthermore, KMB has also stepped up its use of environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark> business practices including use of green energy, like wind or solar power.  Because of its enhanced environmental image, KMB found its way to the EPA's National Top 50 list of Fortune 500 green power users, ranked ninth.<SUP id=""_ref-2"" class=""reference""><A href=""#_note-2"" title="""">[4]</A></SUP></P><H4><SPAN class=""mw-headline""><A href=""/wiki/Supermarket_Consolidation"" title=""Supermarket Consolidation"">Supermarket Consolidation</A></SPAN></H4><P>As the supermarket industry becomes more consolidated, a smaller number of Kimberly-Clark's customers are accounting for a steadily larger percentage of its total sales. A prime example is <A href=""/wiki/Wal-Mart"" title=""Wal-Mart"">Wal-Mart</A>, Kimberly-Clark's largest customer, who accounted for around 13% of the company's 2007 sales.<SUP id=""_ref-3"" class=""reference""><A href=""#_note-3"" title="""">[5]</A></SUP> As a result of this <A href=""/wiki/Wal*Mart%27s_Impact"" title=""Wal*Mart's Impact"">increasing dependence on fewer customers</A>, Kimberly-Clark is losing a great deal of its ability to price its goods at a level that maximizes its own profit margins. Since Wal-Mart and other large retailers buy such a large amount of the company's goods, they can effectively bargain for lower prices; without them, Kimberly-Clark would lose a large percentage of its business. Also, retail chains, Wal-Mart in particular, have been placing an increased focus on <A href=""/wiki/Private_label"" title=""Private label"">private label</A> goods, which provide higher margins for retailers and, usually, lower prices for customers. This trend could be detrimental to Kimberley-Clark and other manufacturers of branded goods as low-price, private label goods increase competition.
</P><H3><SPAN class=""mw-headline""> Population Demographics </SPAN></H3><P>One final, and perhaps underestimated, factor that shapes Kimberly-Clark's business is the number of babies being born. With diaper sales accounting for nearly a quarter of total revenue, a swing in the number of babies would likely have an effect on Kimberly-Clark's sales of diapers and total profit.  If the US, Europe, or other developed countries see a rise in births, there will be more need for diapers, higher sales, and therefore higher revenue.
</P><H3><SPAN class=""mw-headline"">Customer Interaction and Collaboration with Retailers</SPAN></H3><P>While much of K-C's focus on targeted growth opportunities involves connecting with
shoppers and users, K-C implemented a number of programs that helped it
better connect with customers and become their indispensable partner. nmnnhhhh
</P><P>In America and Europe, K-C gained market share by working with leading retailers to develop a new user program for K-C baby and child care products. <mark>Innovation</mark> summits and top-to-top meetings with its strategic customers in North America and Europe
foster more open collaboration and helped K-C obtain insights and early support for
a variety of initiatives, from new products to category development strategies.
</P><H3><SPAN class=""mw-headline"">Kimberly-Clark is Sensitive to Fuel and Pulp Prices</SPAN></H3><P><A href=""/wiki/Fuel_prices"" title=""Fuel prices"">Fuel prices</A> are one of the biggest factors in the manufacturing industry.  Kimberly-Clark’s products must be shipped all around the country and the world, which requires gasoline.  A rise in the price of oil can make shipping more expensive.  Airlines, trucking companies, and ships all charge more to compensate for rising costs, and this extra cost must be absorbed either by the consumer or by the company.  If the company passes this cost on to the consumer, this means that product prices will have to rise, which could turn away consumers and reduce sales.  Alternatively, the company could leave prices alone and accept a smaller margin of profit on their products, but either way profits will likely decrease.  
</P><P>In addition to shipping costs, fuel costs affect general production costs.  Most of Kimberly-Clark’s products come from trees, and getting the trees and manufacturing paper out of them requires an enormous amount of fuel.  The entities involved are usually large factories, mills presses, et cetera, and to continue their own operations many of them also are exposed to energy related costs.  A rise in fuel prices would make the production process more expensive, and as with shipping costs, the Kimberly-Clark would likely experience a decrease in revenue.
</P><P><A href=""/wiki/Pulp?action=edit"" class=""new"" title=""Pulp"">Pulp</A> prices are a significant input factor into Kimberly Clark's cost of goods sold.  Tissue products are almost 100% pulp, either tree-based or recycled.   Therefore, producers are highly exposed to the price of pulp.  KMB purchases about 2.5 million metric tons of pulp annually.  A $50/ton price change translates into a $125 million a year movement in <A href=""/wiki/EBIT"" title=""EBIT"">EBIT</A>, or about $0.20 per share after taxes.<SUP id=""_ref-4"" class=""reference""><A href=""#_note-4"" title="""">[6]</A></SUP></P><H2><SPAN class=""mw-headline"">Competition</SPAN></H2><P>Privately owned SCA Tissue North America (SCA) manufactures washroom paper, tabletop sheets, tissues, and other paper products.

									</SPAN></DIV></DIV></PERSONALIZATION-PLACEMENT></DIV><DIV class=""article article-first-row""><P><STRONG>Companies across the globe are tackling some of the world’s greatest societal challenges — water scarcity, <mark>climate change</mark>, and even the rights of women and girls in the developing world. Tom Falk, the CEO of <mark>Kimberly-Clark Corpo</mark>ration since 2002, talks about how the paper company is taking on environmental issues and has been practicing sustainability for 140 years.</STRONG></P><P><B>Did you ever have a moment where you said to yourself, “We as a company can be part of the solution to environmental problems”?</B></P><P><STRONG>FALK</STRONG>: In 1996, I picked up responsibility for our Energy &amp; Environment group. We had already made a lot of progress in reducing energy consumption and water usage, improving forestry policies, and limiting air and water emissions, but my predecessor thought we should set some stretch goals for 2000. Because of our merger with Scott, we were a much larger company and the year 2000 was coming fast. It was a great time to lay out a bigger vision in this area and rally our teams around it. This was the first time we really put something down on paper.</P><P>I also remember a meeting several years later with Mike Duke, who was then head of Wal-Mart’s international business. I shared our goals for 2005 with him. Mike impressed upon me how much our performance and reputation in sustainability mattered to Wal-Mart and was fully supportive of our efforts. When our largest customer expressed that level of interest and backing, it underscored for me the importance of our sustainability efforts.</P><P><B>How is your company integrating sustainability into how you do business every day? </B></P><P>Every five years we increase the robustness of our goals, further stretching them. We’ve made excellent progress but we still have work to do. For example, we used to think setting a good example was enough but now we know we need to be more explicit about what we expect from suppliers. We require all of our suppliers to abide by the social compliance standards that we set.</P><P><B>Where in your company do ideas for sustainability initiatives start?</B></P><P>Some of the best thinking on how to meet our goals have come from employees in our mills. We first introduced Neve Compacto, a low-energy paper product, in Italy, to help retailers save shelf space and moms save room in their storage closet. Our Brazilian team saw how well it was working there and adapted it for use in their market. It’s been a huge success there. The Compacto rolls reduce the average amount of packaging used by 13%, which is equivalent to just over 1.8 million empty plastic water bottles in one year.</P><P><B>If the ultimate goal is to create both economic value <I>and</I> social value, how do you strike the right balance? Are you willing to take an economic loss of some kind if the social return is unmatched? </B></P><P>This is <I>the</I> tough question in sustainability. We face trade-offs in every area of our business. We never say, “Let’s not spend the money to improve the safety of our machines because it’s cheaper to let employees get injured.” So, yes, we make investments today that have a future payoff and like any investment choice, we consider the risk and benefits to our company and to the world around us.</P><P>We believe that sustainability and corporate social responsibility create value for Kimberly-Clark, whether it’s direct value, like cost savings or risk avoidance, or indirect value, like enhanced reputation or the ability to recruit and retain top talent.</P><P><B>How do you decide which investments to make?</B></P><P>We use the following criteria:</P><UL><LI>We put our employees and the communities in which we do business first.</LI><LI>We support legitimate social and environmental issues that are globally relevant but also have a clear fit with our brands and business strategies.</LI><LI>We look for a connection to the business objectives for the target market.</LI><LI>The benefit must be measureable—we can clearly track the impact on our business and our ability to improve lives.</LI></UL><P><B>How much of your company’s move in this direction is consumer-driven vs. conscience-driven?</B></P><P>As a paper company, established 140 years ago, we started off practicing <mark>sustainable</mark> forestry: When we cut one tree down, we needed to plant two so we would always have the resource to support our business. It’s only been in the last 10 years or so that the term “sustainability” has come in to common usage. For the 130 years before that, Kimberly-Clark was just doing the right thing.</P><P>Sure, consumer interest in <mark>sustainable</mark> products is increasing in various markets around the world. However, the vast majority of consumers won’t trade off product performance or cost for a more <mark>sustainable</mark> solution. Our challenge as brand-builders and manufacturers is to develop products and solutions that are better for the environment and don’t force moms to make a trade off.</P><P>Customers, consumers, employees, investors, suppliers and communities all now expect more from corporations. Great companies will live up to these expectations and win in the marketplace.</P><P><I>This is part of an ongoing series from Harvard Business Review and the </I><A href=""http://skollworldforum.org/""><I>Skoll World Forum</I></A><I> on how mega-corporations are integrating innovative ways to solve social and environmental problems into their core operations. </I></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""authors mvl"" js-target=""authors-section""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""content-area--article column""><DIV class=""is-inline-block width-100pct""><P class=""mbn description-text space-for-headshot""><A href=""/search?term=amy+gallo"" class=""font-size-xlarge line-height-tight"">Amy Gallo</A> is a contributing editor at Harvard Business Review and the author of the <A href=""https://www.amazon.com/HBR-Guide-Dealing-Conflict/dp/1633692159""><EM>HBR Guide to Dealing with Conflict at Work</EM></A>.

If Greenland melts, Miami is underwater.”</P><P>Although Trump threatened during his campaign to remove the U.S. from the 195-country agreement to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), it wasn’t until this week that some type of departure from the plan seemed inevitable.</P><P>While Trump was clear that he is pulling out, he said Thursday he was open to “negotiate our way back in under terms that are fair to the U.S.”</P><P><A href=""http://www.palmbeachpost.com/weather/#radar"" style=""text-decoration: none;""><SPAN style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #1155cc; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Check The Palm Beach Post radar map.</SPAN></A></P><P>U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said on Twitter after the announcement that if the U.S. stops fighting <mark>climate change</mark>, the rest of the world will also.</P><P>“The future of Florida is tied to the ability of the world to shift energy systems,” Pomerance said.</P><P>In the 20th century, sea levels rose 5.5 inches globally.</P><P>Current rates have accelerated to about a foot — 12 inches — per 100 years, according to a 2016 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. That’s compared with pre-industrialization times, when the seas rose only about 1 to 1.5 inches per century.</P><P>An October 2015 refresh of sea-level rise numbers by the Southeast Regional Compact on <mark>Climate Change</mark> found that while South Florida measurements have been similar to what’s happening globally, they are “anticipated to outpace the global average due to ongoing variations in the Florida Currents and Gulf Stream.”</P><P>Between 2015 and 2060, South Florida seas could swell between 11 and 22 inches, based on estimates from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>.</P><P>By 2100, they could rise from 28 inches to 57 inches — between 2.3 feet and 4.7 feet.</P><P>“It’s ironic that Trump would ignore the threat of sea level rise since he owns so much property that would eventually be underwater,” Pomerance said.</P><P>His iconic Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach is threatened by encroaching water. If the worst-case scenario holds true, nearly half of Mar-a-Lago’s 20-acre site would be underwater in 84 years, with the brackish Intracoastal Waterway invading from the west.</P><P><A href=""http://www.palmbeachpost.com/mobile_services/weather/"" style=""text-decoration: none;""><SPAN style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #1155cc; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Download the Palm Beach Post WeatherPlus app here.</SPAN></A></P><P>The blush-colored mansion itself, built in 1927 by Marjorie Merriweather Post, doesn’t succumb until 6 feet of sea level rise occurs, according to a NOAA tool that visualizes sea-level rise.</P><P>Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’ Palm Beach mansion is also threatened by rising seas. It sits about 4.3 feet above sea level on the Intracoastal.</P><P>Ross told Sen. Nelson in a Jan. 23 letter that he is well aware of sea-level rise concerns.</P><P>“As a resident of Florida who lives along the coast, I certainly share your interest and concern about the impact of these changes on coastal areas,” Ross wrote. “Let me preface the following by suggesting that we put aside for now the question of what is causing these changes, and agree to focus on addressing the impacts of those changes.”</P><P>As commerce secretary, Ross oversees the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Weather Service.</P><P>Florida lawmakers were already denouncing the purported <mark>climate</mark> pact withdraw Wednesday with U.S. Rep.

In Kazakhstan, ICEF reduced waterborne illnesses for over 15,000 people in 12 remote villages by introducing technical solutions to current water problems and building <mark>sustainable</mark> water finance systems to ensure the sustainability of safe water in the region.  The Clean Water Financing Program for Kazakhstan received financial support from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Eurasia Foundation, among others.  In Russia and Ukraine, ICEF worked to convert existing grant programs into revolving loan programs targeting water infrastructure and other environmental problems.</LI></UL><H4 id=""clean-energy"" class=""toggle"">Clean Energy and <mark>Climate Change</mark></H4><UL class=""expandable""><LI><STRONG>The Center for Energy &amp; <mark>Climate</mark> Solutions (CECS)</STRONG> was founded in 1999 to help businesses, government and environmental organizations develop high-leverage technological, strategic, financial and regulatory tools to foster the adoption of clean energy solutions. The Center promotes clean and efficient energy technologies to cost-effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants and conducts client-specific research on a wide range of energy and <mark>climate</mark>-related topics.</LI><LI>In December, 2006 GETF’s supported USAID’s Office of Energy in publishing the <STRONG>Powering Health Guidebook</STRONG> to highlight electrification options available for off-grid, rural hospital and clinic facilities in sub-Saharan Africa. The guidebook outlined key considerations for utilizing various energy technologies including capital and operating costs, reliability, durability, emissions output and optimal use guidance. The guidebook is available on the <A href=""http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/economic_growth_and_trade/energy/publications/powering_health_mgmt.pdf"">USAID website (PDF)</A>.</LI><LI><STRONG>Global <mark>Climate Change</mark> Research </STRONG>- The book <EM>Hell and High Water: Global Warming—the Solution and the Politics—and What We Should Do</EM>, written by CECS Executive Director Dr. Joseph Romm, was published by Harper Collins in 2006.  This book examines the science of global warming, the history of the debate, and the potential solutions.  <EM>Hell and High Water </EM>discusses many of the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>, from sea surface rise to increased hurricane strength, presenting the best available science in an accessible format.  CECS has also done extensive research on a great range of technologies and market-based solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</LI><LI><STRONG>Brazilian Rainforest Water Program </STRONG>- As part of The Coca-Cola Company’s <EM>Live Positively </EM> platform for sustainability, Coca-Cola Brasil and its bottling partners launched the “Brazilian Rainforest Water Program” in 2007 to support <mark>climate</mark> and watershed protection through the reforestation of Brazil’s vital Atlantic Rainforest, an effort that serves to subsequentially rehabilitate the environment, protect biodiversity and restore ecosystem benefits once provided by the area. GETF is supporting The Coca-Cola Brazil Institute by providing partnership development support.</LI><LI><STRONG>Energy Management and <mark>Climate</mark> Protection Support </STRONG>- GETF provides strategic counsel and consulting support to The Coca-Cola Company’s Energy Management and <mark>Climate</mark> Protection Team.  This support includes development of long-term strategic options and near-term actions to reduce the company’s <mark>carbon</mark> footprint and cost effectively implement its <mark>climate</mark> protection programs, including partnership development support.  To learn more about The Coca-Cola Company’s <mark>climate</mark> protection initiatives, click <A href=""www.thecoca-colacompany.com/citizenship/energy_<mark>climate</mark>_protection.html"">here </A>to visit their website.</LI><LI><STRONG>National Commission on Energy Policy </STRONG>- Since the inception of the National Commission on Energy Policy (NCEP) in 2002, GETF has provided NCEP and its staff with strategic outreach and communication support to promote the key findings of the Commission’s recommendations.  GETF has also provided the Commission with research and analysis on a wide range of energy issues that include unconventional oil strategies and alternative hydrogen pathways.</LI><LI><STRONG><mark>Climate</mark> Savers </STRONG>- GETF’s Center for Energy &amp; <mark>Climate</mark> Solutions (CECS) supports the World Wildlife Fund’s (WWF) U.S. <mark>Climate</mark> Savers Program.  CECS works with the WWF to help businesses develop and implement leading edge <mark>climate</mark> and energy solutions.  Corporate partners include The Coca-Cola Company, IBM, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Polaroid Corporation, Nike, Lafarge and the Collins Companies, among others.  CECS works with companies in the program to achieve energy efficiency goals and increase the use of clean energy as well as recognize their efforts through the WWF’s communication channels.  By helping companies set reduction goals and achieve them, CECS demonstrates both a strong business and environmental case for making greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions and ways a company can do so without putting up its own capital.  Corporate demonstrations of this type continue to provide a yardstick for what the entire country can do to reduce GHG emissions while accelerating economic growth and job creation.  CECS consultation to both the WWF and the individual companies in this project has helped recruit several companies into the <mark>Climate</mark> Savers Program and develop pathways to achieve critical greenhouse gas reductions.</LI></UL><H4 id=""sustainability"" class=""toggle"">Sustainability</H4><UL class=""expandable""><LI><STRONG>The U.S. EPA Energy Management Workshops</STRONG> was a series of meetings across the United States aimed at improving energy management at water and wastewater utilities. Cosponsors included EPA regional offices, state environmental and energy agencies and professional trade associations. Over 750 participants have learned how to apply a management systems approach (Plan-Do-Check-Act) to improve energy management at their utilities.  GETF is providing follow-up activities with many workshop participants to include energy audits, prioritization of energy opportunities and benefits, implementing assessment tools and securing funding. GETF has conducted workshops throughout the country in all U.S. EPA Regions.  The workshops are based on the <A href=""http://www.peercenter.net/ewebeditpro/items/O73F21748.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Energy Management Guidebook</A> (PDF).</LI><LI><STRONG>The 3rd Port Environmental/Security Management System (EMS/SMS) Assistance Project (2008-2010) </STRONG>was a two-year project that supported five public seaport authorities in developing and implementing management systems to address environmental and security issues. In partnership with the American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA), GETF facilitated the collaborative learning format that has helped over 50 local government entities, including twenty port authorities to date, realize substantial improvement in their environmental, economic and security management performance.  Participants in the 2008-2010 program include the Georgia Ports Authority, South Carolina State Ports Authority, Port of San Diego, Port of Long Beach and the California United Terminals.</LI><LI><STRONG>The National Public Entity EMS Resource (PEER) Center</STRONG> is an umbrella program to support Environmental Management System (EMS) implementation within the public sector.  The PEER Center was built upon data and practitioner experiences from over 100 organizations implementing EMSs through five national EMS initiatives.  The suite of ongoing complimentary programs under the PEER Center umbrella include an online clearinghouse of EMS information, case studies and guidance materials; a family of eleven PEER Local EMS Resource Centers located throughout the country to provide local communities with technical expertise, field tested tools, information sharing and support for EMS implementation; a quarterly newsletter highlighting the latest in public entity EMS achievements and a series of technical guidance tools, including handbooks, workbooks, toolboxes and on-line training modules. To learn more and to view the resources developed by the center, visit the <A href=""http://www.peercenter.net/"">PEER Center website</A>.</LI><LI><STRONG>Green Investment Screening Criteria for the Municipal Bond Market –</STRONG>Being a <mark>sustainable</mark> organization is increasingly important in both the private and public sectors.  Sound approaches to green management offer numerous benefits which translate into lasting success.  While these principles are being more actively applied in the business sector, they strongly apply to local government as well.  For local governments, green management can facilitate improved fiscal management, reduced institutional risk, more effective service delivery and improved economic viability.  Working with representatives from the financial sector, GETF developed criteria to help investors determine the long-term viability of local, city and state governments and the associated impact on their bond performance.</LI><LI><STRONG>Telework and Emissions Trading Study—(Phase II) –</STRONG>Many urban areas in the United States are confronted with major air <mark>pollution</mark> and traffic congestion problems. The federal government, states and local communities are working to address these challenges in a variety of ways, while also seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and oil imports.  Telework is one strategy that can simultaneously reduce traffic congestion, oil consumption and <mark>pollution</mark>. The business community is a critical driver for implementing and expanding telework in the U.S.  Through a grant with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, GETF conducted a study to determine whether emissions trading could incentivize more companies to offer telework programs by providing an additional source of revenue.  Other goals included expanding awareness of telework and identifying barriers to greater adoption of telework.  Local partnerships supporting this ecommute Program worked extensively with businesses to promote telework and explain best practices for implementing such a program.</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""footer""><DIV class=""wrapper""><P>Copyright ©2011 Global Environment &amp; Technology Foundation</P></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The Chamber does not itself reveal its members or their financial contributions, although it does name the business executives who sit on its <A href=""https://www.uschamber.com/about-us/about-us-chamber/leadership"">senior management committee</A> and <A href=""https://www.uschamber.com/about-us/board-directors"">board of directors</A>.</P><P>In 2012, the Chamber reported spending more than $32 million on political advertisements to the Federal Election Commission, most of which urged viewers to vote against congressional Democrats.</P><P>Such overt political engagement has continued this election cycle.</P><P>In recent months, the Chamber has released a flurry of ads praising Republicans in Congress, ranging from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho, a veteran lawmaker who has been targeted for defeat by conservative groups such as the Club for Growth, which accuses him of being a “liberal Republican.”</P><P>The Chamber is also Washington’s king of the influence game, having spent more than $100 million in 2012 lobbying on issues ranging from financial regulations to healthcare to immigration reform.</P><P>In recent years, it has also worked hard to defeat <A href=""http://www.publicintegrity.org/2012/06/20/9145/us-chamber-gop-block-election-ad-transparency-bill"">the DISCLOSE Act</A> — legislation advanced by Democrats to require politically active nonprofits to reveal additional information about their funders.</P><P>With many activists, lawmakers and regulators clamoring for increased scrutiny of political spending by social welfare nonprofits, trade associations like the Chamber could play even larger roles in terms of dark money spending in the 2014 and 2016 elections.</P><P>The $11 million in disclosed contributions are a mere sliver of the Chamber’s <A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/835660-chamber-of-commerce-2012.html"">$188 million</A> in total 2012 receipts.</P><P>The top self-reporting donors to the Chamber in 2012 are: Dow Chemical Co.

($515,500).</P><P>Yet companies likely gave much more than was able to be counted. Several companies reported only what portion of their dues payments were used for lobbying and political activities, not their total contributions.</P><P>Many also provided information only if the spending exceeded a minimum threshold, such as “at least $50,000.” Since the disclosures are voluntary, there is no reporting standard, federal or otherwise, by which they must abide.</P><P>Furthermore, 12 companies — including Best Buy Co.

“When customers can associate a store or company with a particular political position, they may be less likely to shop there if they disagree with that position.”</P><P>For instance, the Fix the Debt

Scott Walker speaking at the New North Summit in 2017. Photo from the State of Wisconsin.</P></DIV><P>One of the Fox Valley’s largest employers has announced it is closing two Wisconsin plants and eliminating 600 jobs<SPAN class=""_Tgc _s8w"">—</SPAN>but that won’t change its eligibility to claim a state tax credit that nearly eliminates the requirement for manufacturers to pay state income taxes. That’s because businesses can claim the credit even if they lay off workers, shutter factories, or ship jobs overseas.</P><P>The Manufacturing and Agriculture Credit costs the state an estimated $276 million this year in tax breaks for manufacturers and agricultural producers. That’s a lot of money. For example, that’s more than all the tuition and fees combined paid by students in Wisconsin’s technical college system.</P><P>For such a big tax break, you might think that the state would require a great deal of accountability on the part of manufacturers receiving the credit. But in fact, there is no requirement that businesses create even a single job to receive the credit. Kimberly-Clark’s announcement illustrates that allowing a corporation to get away with paying next to nothing in income taxes doesn’t mean that corporation will increase the number of workers it employs.</P>Companies base their hiring and plant location decisions based on a variety of factors in addition to taxes, including the health and skill set of the workforce in the area, the reliability of the state’s transportation network, and the safety of the communities in which the plants are located. Giving enormous tax breaks to manufacturers makes it more difficult for the state to pay for these types of investments and public services that make the state a good place to do business and raise a family.<P>Nearly wiping out income taxes for manufacturers hasn’t done much to spur the growth of manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin. Wisconsin ranked 28<SUP>th</SUP> among the states in the rate of growth of manufacturing jobs between June 2016 and June 2017, based on the most current “gold standard” employment figures from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. The number of manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin increased by only 0.8% during that period, compared to the national average of 1.1%.</P><P>While the Manufacturing and Agriculture credit doesn’t do much to keep jobs in the state, it does serve another purpose: to line the pockets of the wealthy and well-connected who have rigged the system to their benefit. The credit is strongly slanted in favor of the very rich, to the point where millionaires take home nearly three-quarters of the portion of the credit that is claimed through the individual income tax, despite making up only 12% of the claimants (and a much smaller share of the total population). In fact, just 15 credit claimants<SPAN class=""_Tgc _s8w"">—</SPAN>all with incomes of at least $30 million<SPAN class=""_Tgc _s8w"">—</SPAN>received a combined tax break of $28 million from this credit. That averages out to a tax cut of a whopping $1.8 million each for these extremely wealthy claimants. These figures are based on the Legislative Fiscal Bureau’s <A href=""http://www.wisconsinbudgetproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-1-LFB-memo-man-ag-cost.pdf"">analysis of the costs</A> and <A href=""http://www.wisconsinbudgetproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-1-LFB-memo-man-ag-distribution.pdf"">distribution of this credit</A>.</P><DIV id=""attachment_392798"" style=""width: 730px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Credit Mostly Goes to Millionaires</P></DIV><P>Now, Governor <STRONG><A href=""http://urbanmilwaukee.com/people/scott-walker"">Walker</A></STRONG> and other state policymakers are saying that nearly wiping out the requirement for manufacturers to pay income taxes is not enough, and that Wisconsin should also publicly subsidize a portion of each job that Kimberly-Clark (and potentially other companies in the same situation) identifies as threatened.</P><P>Given the high cost of the Manufacturing and Agriculture credit, its failure to spur employment, and its extremely slanted nature, Wisconsin policymakers should be seeking to roll back the credit. Instead, Governor Walker and other lawmakers have proposed giving an even bigger break to Kimberly-Clark (and presumably other companies) by paying cash subsidies to maintain employment levels, similar to a portion of the incentive package that the state offered Foxconn.</P><P>After the Foxconn deal, it’s not surprising that legislators in the Fox Valley want Kimberly-Clark to get similar cash subsidies, on top of the state’s other tax credits. But the Foxconn deal was extraordinarily generous, and the state can’t afford to throw cash at every corporation that is cutting jobs or threatening job cuts. Doing so would make it more difficult for the state to make investments in its communities and families, and would hurt the state’s long-term economic competitiveness.</P><DIV id=""topic-list""><H3>More about the Kimberly-Clark Plant Closings</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

	Executive officers may receive long-term equity incentive awards of stock options, restricted stock or restricted share units, or a combination of stock options, restricted stock and restricted share units under the 2011 Plan, which was approved by stockholders in 2011. The 2011 Plan provides the Committee with discretion to require performance-based standards to be met before awards vest. The Committee awarded time-vested restricted share units to Mr. Allgaier in 2017 in connection with his hire which vest in one-fifth increments on each of the first through fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. In 2017, each named executive officer received grants of stock options and performance-based restricted share units under the 2011 Plan.
</FONT></P><P style=""TEXT-ALIGN: LEFT""><FONT size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">
	For grants of stock options, the 2011 Plan provides that the option price per share shall be no less than the closing price per share of our common stock at the grant date. The term of any option is no more than ten years from the grant date. Options granted in 2017 become exercisable in three annual installments of 30 percent, 30 percent and 40 percent, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date; however, all of the options become exercisable for the earlier of three years or the remaining term of the options upon death or total and permanent disability, and for the earlier of five years or the remaining term of the options, upon retirement of the officer. In addition, options generally become exercisable upon a termination of employment following a change of control, and certain options granted to our named executive officers are subject to our Executive Severance Plan. See “Potential Payments on Termination or Change of Control.” The officers may transfer the options to family members or certain entities in which family members have interests.
</FONT></P><P style=""TEXT-ALIGN: LEFT""><FONT size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">
	Performance-based restricted share unit awards granted in 2017 vest three years following the grant date in a range from zero to 200 percent of the target levels. Awards that vest, if any, are based on our average annual net sales growth and average adjusted ROIC performance during the three years. As of February 7, 2018, the performance-based restricted share units granted in 2017 and 2016 were on pace to vest at the following levels: 83 percent for the 2017 award and 107 percent for the 2016 award.

Myrick, vice president and general manager_of Air Liquide Healthcare America Corp.-Scott Medical Products; and Sue M. Sears, vice president of global market development for the <mark>Kimberly-Clark Corp.</mark></P><P>“This morning we are in the company of four extraordinary and remarkable women whose careers in business, law and entrepreneurship make them some of America's most respected business leaders,” Sloane-White said, noting that the panelists would review their careers focusing on how they dealt with the gender bias that keeps women from filling more positions within America's corporate hierarchy.</P><P>While half the graduates from top business schools in the U.S. are women, Sloane-White said, only 16 percent are corporate officers at Fortune 500 companies and only 1.4 percent are CEOs. Women earn 60 percent of all master's degrees, 47 percent of all law degrees and fill 50 percent of the management and professional positions in this country, yet, even though the “pipeline is full,” women at the top of their fields are still statistical anomalies. So, why is it so hard for women to get there, she asked the panelists.</P><P>“We never said the word sexual discrimination because your career was over, so what you did was to be better than the guy next to you,” Rollins said. She always had big goals and as she moved up the corporate ladder, she said she realized companies weren't going to do anything to help women in the workplace until they were forced to.</P><P>“'We're not going to do it until they make us do it' permeates the corporate world,” Rollins said. When she joined Sun Co. as the first female officer in a $6 billion company, she said she realized after a while that she was the “token” woman and they had no intention of letting her move up or make significant changes there. “Then, I did the absolute unthinkable--I got pregnant.” When she returned from maternity leave after her second child, she quit Sun and joined Rollins Jamaica.</P><P>Sears said she began her career as a secretary with Scott Paper Co. and got her college degree while raising three boys. Since then, she has served as president of the Global Do-It-Yourself Business, an entrepreneurial retail arm of Kimberly-Clark, vice president of marketing for Unisource Worldwide Inc, a leading distributor of printing and imaging products, packaging systems and sanitary maintenance supplies in North America, with sales of $7 billion.</P><P>As vice president of global marketing development with Kimberly Clark, Sears said she is one of 11 women officers in the corporation of more than 60,000 employees. “I do feel that it is my mission to bring more talented women, more diversity, more people of color up in the organization because the world is very global and in order for us to be successful we need to represent our world in the types of employees and leaders we have in the corporation.”</P>DeMatteis, served as senior counsel to U.S. Sen. Joseph R. Biden and on U.S. Rep. Mike Castle's staff when he was governor of Delaware and when he went to Congress. She said Biden asked her to join his staff as administrative assistant, but she recoiled at the title. “I'll take the job but not the title,” DeMatteis said, so Biden asked her what she wanted to be called--senior counsel she said, and he said done. “It was at a time when things got done in Washington,” she said.<P>“I personally feel we've turned the corner as women in business. At my law firm there are two-dozen attorneys on flex-time status [and] the majority of them are men. We have women mentoring circles. My firm created a leadership counsel.”</P><P>Myrick began her career with Procter &amp; Gamble as a product development engineer. She spent 20 years with FMC Corp., a diversified chemicals and machinery company, in positions of increasing responsibility, including general manager of FMC BioPolymer Pharmaceuticals, a global pharmaceutical ingredients business. In 2001, Myrick joined Rhodia Inc., a specialty chemicals company headquartered in France, as vice president and general manager of specialty phosphates, North America, and later was named vice president and general manager of home, personal care and industrial ingredients, North America.</P><P>Myrick said she resigned after 20 years with FMC when a man was given a promotion she felt she deserved,Her resignation was turned down and instead, she was given the job she wanted.</P><P>“I had to quit in order for them to do the right thing,” Myrick said. “I hope when I come back 10 years from now it will be less unique for us to be up here talking about our careers.”</P><P>Article by Barbara Garrison</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

He said Walker was being reactive, rather than being a leader to protect existing jobs.</P><P>&quot;This sounds more like someone who is caught off guard and is defensive,&quot; Hintz said of Walker's Kimberly-Clark proposal. &quot;There are a lot of economic forces at work that are transforming the global economy, including Wisconsin's.
