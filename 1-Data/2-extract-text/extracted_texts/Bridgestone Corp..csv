Globally, 1 in 3 women will experience gender-based violence in her lifetime. In the developing world, 1 in 7 girls is married before her 15th birthday, with some child brides as young as 8 or 9. Each year more than 287,000 women, 99 percent of them in developing countries, die from pregnancy- and childbirth-related complications.</P><P>While women make up more than 40 percent of the agriculture labor force only 3 to 20 percent are landholders. In Africa, women-owned enterprises make up as little as 10 percent of all businesses. In South Asia, that number is only 3 percent. And despite representing half the global population, women comprise less than 20 percent of the world's legislators.</P><H2 class=""intro"">The Opportunity</H2><P><A href=""https://www.usaid.gov/infographics/50th/why-invest-in-women"">Investing in gender equality and women’s empowerment</A> can unlock human potential on a transformational scale.</P><P>Women account for one-half of the potential human capital in any economy. More than half a billion women have joined the world’s work force over the past 30 years, and they make up 40 percent of the agriculture labor force. According to the World Bank, countries with greater gender equality are more prosperous and competitive.</P><P>An extra year of secondary school for girls can increase their future earnings by 10-20 percent. Girls with secondary schooling are up to 6 times less likely to marry as children than those with little or no education. And countries that invest in girls’ education have lower maternal and infant deaths, lower rates of HIV and AIDS, and better child nutrition.</P><P>When women participate in civil society and politics, governments are more open, democratic and responsive to citizens. When women are at the negotiating table, peace agreements are more inclusive and durable. And simply by empowering women farmers with the same access to land, new technologies and capital as men, we can increase crop yields by as much as 30 percent helping to feed a growing population.</P><H2 class=""intro"">Our Strategy</H2><P>At USAID, we believe that gender equality and women’s empowerment isn’t a part of development but the core of development.</P><P>Progress cannot be delivered in a vacuum. For societies to thrive, women and girls must have access to education, healthcare, and technology. They must have control of resources, lands, and markets. And they must have equal rights and equal opportunities as breadwinners, peace-builders and leaders.</P><P>That’s why we have gender programs in more than 80 countries. In 2012, we released our <A href=""https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1865/GenderEqualityPolicy_0.pdf"">Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Policy</A> [PDF, 2.7 MB], cementing our commitment to supporting women and girls. Building on this critical foundation and decades of experience, we’re ensuring all our strategies and programs are shaped by a gender analysis, and establish metrics that measure the gender impact of our programs.</P><P>Through <A href=""http://www.feedthefuture.gov/"">Feed the Future</A>, we’re advancing policy changes that give women access to financial services and ownership of the very land they tend. One year after launching <A href=""http://www.savingmothersgivinglife.org/"">Saving Mothers, Giving Life</A> in Uganda and Zambia, the public-private partnership program has reduced maternal mortality by roughly a third. In Afghanistan, the <A href=""https://www.usaid.gov/afghanistan/promote/"">Promoting Gender Equality in National Priority Programs (PROMOTE) Partnership</A> is the largest investment we have ever made to advance women and girls in development.</P><H3>Related Resources</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

By and large they underwrote the efforts of others. The hands-on work fell, as it does today, to NGO leaders, service providers, activists, and many others on the front lines of social change. The common thread in these success stories was that philanthropists understood the importance of the five elements and were willing to fund any or all of them as needed. They acted as sources of flexible capital, identifying gaps left by others and directing their resources accordingly. Sometimes only minor support focused on one of the five elements was enough to tip the scales.</P><P>This framework does not constitute a simple or linear recipe. Real change is highly complex and driven by many forces, luck and timing play important roles, and causality is impossible to prove. Still, we believe that if ambitious philanthropists apply the framework over the arc of a campaign, they may substantially increase the odds of achieving transformative change.</P><H2>The Challenge</H2><P>Before we look closely at our historical success stories, it’s instructive to consider some high-level reasons why so many efforts wither on the vine. Most of the initiatives we studied shared four important patterns: Success took a long time—nearly 90% of the efforts spanned more than 20 years (with a median of about 45 years). It frequently entailed government cooperation—80% required changes to government funding, policies, or actions. It often necessitated collaboration—nearly 75% involved active coordination among key actors across sectors. And at least 66% featured donors who made one or more philanthropic big bets—gifts of $10 million or more.</P><P>Unfortunately, these patterns go against the grain of much philanthropic practice today. Donors know conceptually that achieving widespread change can take a long time, even for the most important and straightforward ideas. (As the physician Atul Gawande points out, the basic lifesaving practice of hand washing and sterilizing surgical instruments and facilities took 30 years to gain acceptance even after a leading medical journal published ironclad evidence in support of it.) Yet philanthropists often fund grantees with the expectation that much more complex change can be achieved in just a handful of years. Wary of red tape and of being perceived as “too political,” many donors have been unwilling to fund work that meaningfully engages with the U.S. government, despite the central role it plays and the trillions of dollars it spends addressing society’s toughest problems. Furthermore, collaboration of any type can be difficult and costly, so few philanthropists meaningfully support or engage in it, even though most are frustrated with the inefficient proliferation of siloed change efforts. And finally, only a small fraction of donor gifts for social change are large enough to make a dent—although philanthropists routinely commit $20 million or more to infinitely simpler challenges, such as building a university library or a museum wing.</P><P>To be sure, in none of our success stories could a philanthropist declare total victory. Despite near-universal use of infant car seats, children still die in car accidents. Despite nationwide access to free and reduced-price lunch, schoolchildren still go hungry. Despite substantial increases, farmworkers still have not achieved truly livable wages. But by focusing on the elements in the framework above, the movements’ donors and change leaders enabled huge strides.</P><P>Let’s look at the five elements in detail and explore how a thorough understanding of each can help funders pave the way for meaningful change.</P><H2>Build a Shared Understanding of the Problem and Its Ecosystem</H2><P>Everyone knows that you can’t solve a problem you don’t understand. The leaders of the successful social movements we studied appreciated and carefully framed the issues they sought to address. They knew who was affected and what forces perpetuated the problems. They often studied deeply entrenched racial, cultural, and economic dynamics, enabling them to attack root causes; figured out who benefited from (and would fight to preserve) the status quo; and built evidence bases that propelled action. And they revisited these questions as the problems and surrounding ecosystems evolved or as the change effort moved into new population segments, geographies, or other frontiers.</P><P>Consider the movement to reduce tobacco use in the United States. Decades of research funding, including substantial investments from the American Cancer Society and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, among others, were needed to construct an airtight scientific case that tobacco was harmful to people’s health. The consensus that was built among scientists, doctors, government leaders, and eventually smokers was crucial to overcoming vigorous resistance and obstruction funded by Big Tobacco.</P><P>Still, getting people to break a socially reinforced habit involving a cheap, widely available, and chemically addictive product was extremely difficult. Recognizing the limitations of early smoking-cessation efforts, advocates continued to invest in research and problem reframing. This led them to modify their definition of the problem and pivot from smoking cessation per se to the broader aim of tobacco control.</P><P>To make it easier for individuals to quit, the movement refined the scientific and behavioral understanding of smoking as an addiction, facilitating the creation of products such as nicotine gum and patches. At the same time, it began to invest in changing the “system” of incentives and cultural norms that helped perpetuate smoking, resulting in laws to restrict smoking and protect the health of nonsmokers; significantly higher cigarette taxes; heavy restrictions or bans on sales channels such as vending machines; the outlawing of smoking in public places, advertising aimed at children, and ultimately mass-market advertising; and a decline in Hollywood and TV portrayals of smoking. Cigarettes eventually became expensive, inconvenient, and socially stigmatized, and smoking rates among adults plummeted from 42% a half century ago to 15% in 2015.</P><P>The best philanthropists understand that agreeing on the problem to be addressed is a seemingly obvious but highly tricky step, and they commission actionable research and policy analysis that foster consensus around why a problem persists and how to attack it. They also understand that such investments must be ongoing, because the problem and its ecosystem shift over time. Had antitobacco advocates relied only on the research reports commissioned in the 1950s and 1960s, their efforts might have been scientifically correct but largely failed. And note that cutting the smoking rate to below 15% is likely to require further research and reframing of the problem, because the challenge is substantively different, in much the way solving the “last mile” challenge in business (how to reach customers in the most remote or challenging contexts) differs from growing a nascent customer base.</P><H2>Set Winnable Milestones and Hone a Compelling Message</H2><P>Making progress is hard when the goal is big and vague; behavioral science teaches us that it’s human nature to get paralyzed. The leaders in our case studies often kept people motivated and engaged by identifying concrete, measurable goals—what we call “winnable milestones”—and pairing them with emotionally compelling messages or calls to action. Honing an emotionally resonant message requires a range of activities, such as polling, message testing, and conducting focus groups, that lie outside the traditional scope for donors and are typically considered unacceptable “overhead” when they appear in nonprofit budgets.</P><P>Tim Gill and other philanthropists who support LGBTQ rights demonstrated the importance of setting milestones. In the early 2000s, at the urging of movement leaders including attorney Evan Wolfson, they began devoting considerable resources to the very specific objective of legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. For decades the movement had focused on the broad goal of “advancing LGBTQ rights,” and although that work continued, leaders hoped that a significant push on a concrete winnable milestone would more powerfully advance the larger cause. They further concentrated efforts on a targeted set of states in order to build momentum and lay the public and legal foundations for a national victory.</P><P>Leaders of other successful movements have similarly focused on concrete goals, such as “eradicating polio” (as opposed to lowering childhood mortality rates) and increasing migrant farmworkers’ wages by “one penny per pound.” But even so, those movements made little progress until they landed on core messages with emotional resonance—ones that spoke to the heart as well as the head, such as searing images of crippled children and harrowing accounts of farmworker abuse. Indeed, the marriage equality movement struggled to connect with the general public as recently as 2008, even losing a well-funded ballot initiative in left-leaning California. In the aftermath of that and other setbacks, supportive philanthropists financed polling and focus groups to help movement leaders understand how to reframe the core message. The research revealed that many voters perceived the movement as driven primarily by same-sex couples’ desire for the government benefits and rights conferred by marriage—and they did not find that a gripping rationale. This insight was pivotal: The movement refocused its communications strategy on equality of love and commitment, arguing that “love is love”—a message that struck a chord. Victories piled up, culminating in the 2015 Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage throughout the United States. And although limited in scope, the push for marriage equality advanced the broader LGBTQ rights agenda in ways that might not otherwise have been possible or that would have taken much longer.</P><H2>Design Approaches That Will Work at Massive Scale</H2><P>A solution that doesn’t work at the scale of the problem isn’t a real solution. Unfortunately, billions of philanthropic dollars are poured into perfecting social services and products that are truly viable only for small numbers of an affected group—5,000 people, five cities, even five states. Such efforts are often local, entrepreneurial, or academic responses to unmet needs or low-quality, underfunded government services (a different way to waste money). But the “<mark>innovation</mark>s” themselves are often too expensive, too complex, or too dependent on specialized talent to be viable at the extent of the need. And even when small-scale solutions are tested with larger groups, the leap is usually from, say, 500 people to 1,000—which reveals almost nothing. The real question should be whether an <mark>innovation</mark> that can serve 500 people can effectively serve 50,000 or 500,000 people.</P><P>Of course, designing a solution or a change strategy that works at scale is enormously challenging. Like any <mark>innovation</mark> process, it may involve many false starts. The key test is to determine what it would take for the proposed approach to be implemented at full scale—and then critically evaluate whether that is realistic. Often, simple math demonstrates that it is not. For example, if 10 million impoverished American youths need help getting into and graduating from college, and a high-quality program costs $5,000 per person, we need to ask whether any funding model, even one led by the government, could feasibly cover the $50 billion a year needed to serve them all. Could any police force realistically control illegal logging in the dense and gigantic Amazon rainforest? Can we expect that 25 million nurses across India will learn and reliably implement a 20-step procedure for sterilizing medical equipment? Do we believe that billions of concerned coffee drinkers will do their own research to make sure that their particular blend is grown under fair conditions? Those tactics might work at limited scope, but they’re all likely to break down at the full scale of the need.</P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P><SPAN class=""callout"">Billions of dollars are poured into initiatives that are not viable at scale.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV><P>Still, cracking this nut is possible. All 15 initiatives in our study achieved impact at scale, although no two followed the same path. Some did it by investing deeply in R&amp;D and developing an innovative form of an existing product, program, or process; some found a breakthrough business model; some took advantage of an existing distribution system instead of trying to build a new one; and some hit upon one or more novel leverage points to influence the relevant field or system. Often, philanthropy is needed to support this kind of <mark>innovation</mark> and experimentation, especially for solutions that truly work at scale.</P><P>Consider Aravind Eye Hospitals. The organization was founded in 1976 by Govindappa Venkataswamy (Dr. V), an Indian physician who set out to eliminate preventable cataract-caused blindness among the 48 million residents of the state of Tamil Nadu. Initially financed by the “philanthropy” of Dr. V and his family (he mortgaged his home for start-up funds), Aravind developed an ultra-efficient surgical process and paired it with a business model based on a variable fee structure. Together these allowed Aravind to treat hundreds of thousands of poor patients at little or no charge by attracting enough paying patients to cover the costs for the poor. Now serving some 250,000 people a year—with quality equal to or better than the British National Health System’s, and at one one-thousandth of the cost—Aravind has propelled a dramatic drop in the rate of blindness throughout Tamil Nadu and has expanded to serve and share its model in other regions as well.</P><P>Consider also the lifesaving technique known as CPR, which achieved widespread adoption in the United States thanks to its “product” <mark>innovation</mark>. The leaders of the movement relied on significant simplification of the technique—work funded largely by research and local philanthropic grants—so that almost any layperson could remember and perform it. This enabled it to be picked up and broadly disseminated through massive existing distribution channels. Beginning in 1975, the American Red Cross incorporated CPR into its network of first aid, workplace safety, and lifeguarding courses; the American Heart Association soon followed. Today more than 18 million Americans, including many high school students taking health classes, are trained in CPR every year, and the procedure is administered to almost 50% of people who experience cardiac arrest outside a hospital, doubling or tripling their chances of survival when performed within the first few minutes.</P><P>Finally, in a David-versus-Goliath triumph, a group of migrant farmworkers in Florida—who pick almost all the winter tomatoes in the United States—hit upon a scalable model and leverage point to gain humane working conditions and a 70% increase in wages. This wasn’t simple or quick; it required years of trial and error. For decades the workers had endured wage theft, verbal and physical abuse, racial discrimination, and sexual harassment in the course of punishing 70- to 80-hour workweeks—and for earnings amounting to just $10,000 or so a year. In 1996, when a worker was badly beaten by his crew leader for asking to take a water break, the community had had enough. A group called the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) responded for years with protests, hunger strikes, and a 234-mile march along a major highway to try to pressure farmers into improving conditions.</P><P>These actions had little effect. But CIW, aided by modest local philanthropy, a few faith-based funders, and the Public Welfare Foundation, continued to experiment until it found a strategy with the potential to affect the problem at scale: applying grassroots pressure to consumer-facing bulk purchasers of tomatoes, such as fast-food restaurants. These companies were much more vulnerable than growers to pressure tactics, because their clientele was the public. With the support of other grassroots networks, including the Student/Farmworker Alliance and Interfaith Action, CIW launched a series of fast-food boycotts, starting with Taco Bell.</P><P>From 2002 to 2005, CIW and allies at 22 universities and high schools nationwide ended sponsorships and removed or blocked the opening of Taco Bell restaurants on their campuses. They launched campaigns in dozens of other communities as well. The pressure tactics worked: Taco Bell’s parent company, Yum! Brands, agreed to pay growers an additional penny per pound of tomatoes to go directly to workers’ wages; it also agreed to require that its growers adhere to humane working standards and allow monitoring by an independent nonprofit entity. With increasing philanthropic support from national funders such as the Kresge, Kellogg, and Ford foundations, CIW extended the boycott to other companies, and over the next few years it won the support of McDonald’s, Subway, Burger King, and Whole Foods, along with food service providers Bon Appétit, Compass, Aramark, and Sodexo. In 2010 the growers agreed to raise wages and improve working conditions. The reforms have since been adopted by growers as far away as New Jersey and agreed to by chains including Walmart, Stop &amp; Shop, Giant, and Trader Joe’s. The movement’s success has been celebrated by the White House and the United Nations.</P><P>The best funders understand that effectiveness and scalability must be equals. Rather than incrementally growing a small-scale strategy or solution, a donor may get more bang for the buck by patiently supporting grantees in rigorous R&amp;D and testing until they discover an approach that works at scale.</P><H2>Drive (Rather than Assume) Demand</H2><P>Even if you build it, they may not come. The philanthropists behind our successful case studies realized this. So they invested in solutions that users and partners actually wanted. They funded robust sales and marketing efforts to support their ambitious goals. They supported the creation of new government requirements or regulations. And they ensured strong distribution networks that helped drive uptake by providing easy access.</P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P><SPAN class=""callout"">The best donors understand that effectiveness and scalability must be equals.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV><P>Consider the effort to reduce traffic fatalities in Vietnam by encouraging the use of motorcycle helmets—a campaign funded in large part by Chuck Feeney’s Atlantic Philanthropies. One of Atlantic’s first grants of the campaign went to the Asian Injury Prevention Foundation, in 2000. Although motorcycle helmets had been around for a long time, AIPF’s founder, Greig Craft, believed that the inappropriate design of existing helmets for tropical <mark>climate</mark>s contributed to the very low rates of use in Vietnam. Atlantic provided $1.5 million to help launch a factory to manufacture lightweight, well-ventilated helmets specifically for the tropics. With this new solution in hand and a shared understanding of the problem thanks to philanthropically funded research and cross-sector working groups, Vietnam’s National Assembly drafted a new law mandating helmet use. Before the law took effect, AIPF helped mobilize funders to back a huge advertising push that used TV, billboards, sides of buses, and other channels to help educate and change behavior among the public. The campaign, which was based on best practices from other parts of the world, achieved a breakthrough relatively quickly: According to the World Health Organization, rates of use jumped almost immediately after the helmet law took effect, in 2007, from less than 30% to roughly 95%, and have stayed relatively constant since.</P><P>Significant investments in demand generation also contributed to the scaling of a simple, affordable intervention that has saved millions of lives in Bangladesh. As recently as the 1980s, dehydration from diarrheal diseases caused 20% of the deaths of children under the age of five, killing hundreds of thousands of children each year. That was despite the availability of a cheap and highly effective oral-rehydration solution consisting of nothing more than a precise mixture of sugar, salt, and water, developed more than a decade earlier by researchers in Dhaka. The government had distributed packets of the solution to its clinics across the country, but most sat on the shelf, unused. The problem was twofold: The solution was not in keeping with long-held cultural beliefs about treatment, and government clinics were rarely used in rural areas—more than 80% of Bangladeshi mothers relied instead on traditional healers, village health volunteers, and other informal providers for their health needs.</P><P>Two major donor-funded efforts helped turn things around. Starting in 1980, several aid agencies and international NGOs invested more than $22 million (in 2016 dollars) in a 10-year education campaign run by the Bangladesh-based NGO BRAC. The campaign trained thousands of local women to mix the solution and sent them door-to-door to teach more than 12 million households about the lifesaving treatment. And in 1983, USAID began a multimillion-dollar funding of the Social Marketing Company, a local social enterprise incubated by Population Services International, to mass-produce, market, and sell the packets. To meet the distribution challenge and further drive demand, SMC built connections with the thousands of unlicensed health-care providers who served most Bangladeshi families. It also secured partnerships with private distributors, who by 2007 had brought the packets to 91% of the country’s pharmacies and 32% of its grocery stores. Today the solution is used by 80% of Bangladeshi households, and children’s deaths from diarrheal diseases have plummeted by 90%.</P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P><SPAN class=""callout"">Funders must create the space to learn, adjust, and even fail.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV><P>Finally, let’s look at <EM>Sesame Street.</EM> In the late 1960s, the Carnegie Corporation’s vice president, Lloyd Morrisett, commissioned television producer Joan Ganz Cooney to explore the then-revolutionary concept of early learning for children via television. The two collaborated on an ambitious budget for the initial season: roughly $55 million (in 2016 dollars). Cooney advocated investing in strong design, including hiring a leading children’s entertainment producer—thus boosting the odds that the show would resonate with its target beneficiaries. She pushed for ongoing research to test how well the program captured children’s attention and improved their learning. And a significant share of the budget—8%—was earmarked for publicity and outreach.</P><P>Morrisett secured a $7 million contribution from Carnegie and raised the rest from other philanthropies and the government. <EM>Sesame Street</EM> succeeded spectacularly. In its first week, more than 1.5 million children tuned in—twice the number of children attending preschool. Within a year the program was reaching 36% of all preschool-aged children; by 1993 the figure was 77%. Today <EM>Sesame Street</EM> is viewed by more than 156 million children around the world, and numerous studies have demonstrated that it significantly advances early learning, contributing to a rise in similar programming by other broadcasters.</P><H2>Embrace Course Corrections</H2><P>Every long-haul effort hits roadblocks. To achieve winnable milestones over decades, funders need to support their grantees’ capacity to continuously improve. Experienced funders recognize that challenges may differ by context (urban versus rural versus last mile) and population segment (early adopters versus laggards) and that social-impact organizations need to experiment, measure, and adapt as those factors change. But only a handful of philanthropists today invest deeply in creating the space and infrastructure for grantees to learn, adjust, and at times fail. Patience is limited, and what little money is earmarked for measurement and evaluation too often prioritizes accountability and attribution of credit rather than learning for continuous improvement.</P><ARTICLE-SIDEBAR class=""article-sidebar sidebar--half"" data-sidebar-alternate=""sidebar""><H4 class=""sidebar-title"">Further Reading</H4><DIV class=""sidebar-contents height--collapse""><P class=""mbl""><SPAN class=""mediaauthor"">Roger L.

Rodney Davis stopped by Bloomington-Normal on Thursday to tour the Bridgestone plant in Normal and discuss the need to invest in workforce training opportunities.</P><P>“Manufacturing is experiencing a resurgence, but we have a workforce problem,” Davis said. “We have historic low unemployment and a historic high government benefit usage. We ought to be able to invest tax dollars in Washington to help get people the training they need for the jobs that are available.”</P><P>Last year <A href=""https://rodneydavis.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=399327"">Davis introduced the LEAP Act</A> along with U.S. Reps. Dan Lipinski, D-Chicago, and Adam Kinzinger, R-Channahon. Davis said he's trying to build enough pressure to get it onto the House floor.</P><P>The bill would offer tax incentives to encourage more companies to offer apprenticeship programs. It focuses on tax incentives to hire younger apprentices, but it would also incentivize companies to hire older apprentices, with a smaller tax break.</P><P>Davis said demand for Bridgestone’s products is up because there is more mining in the United States, but his goal now is to help companies train people to take the jobs that will soon become available to meet the demand.</P><P>“That means more jobs in Bloomington-Normal, but (Bridgestone has) the same problem that Caterpillar in Decatur has,” Davis said. “They don’t have the applicants coming in to take those jobs. Those are things we’re going to work on together in Washington.”</P><P>Davis also said too many students are pushed to attend a four-year university when joining the workforce may suit them better and save them from potentially coming out of college with a lot of student debt, sometimes without having completed their degrees.</P><P>“There’s not going to be less demand for people going to four-year institutions,” Davis said. “A lot of times, it’s the kids who aren’t going to go to (Illinois State) or to (Illinois) Wesleyan, who have no intention of going, that ought to be able to have access to workforce training opportunities to be able to get trained for jobs that are available, like the ones here at Bridgestone.”</P><P>Davis said he hopes companies like Bridgestone will work with local educators to present high school graduates with opportunities in the trades.</P><P>Bridgestone currently employs over 400 people in Bloomington-Normal area.</P><P><EM>WGLT depends on financial support from users to bring you stories and interviews like this one.

Mighty Earth undertook mapping of cocoa-producing regions in four countries outside of West Africa and found a high risk of deforestation in various cocoa-producing areas.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Through detailed satellite mapping and overlaying maps of deforestation and cocoa-producing regions, we found large-scale deforestation within cocoa-producing regions of Indonesia, Cameroon, Peru, and Ecuador. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">This Valentine’s Day mapping warrants more detailed investigations into the companies driving cocoa-deforestation worldwide, and research into how much of the deforestation in the cocoa-producing regions can be attributed to cocoa as opposed to other commodities. What is crystal clear however, is that the chocolate industry is expanding right now in countries like Indonesia, Peru, Ecuador, and Cameroon that still boast extensive rainforests. With demand for chocolate increasing, the chocolate industry risks aggressively expanding to rainforest nations around the world; in many places, exporting the same bad practices that contributed to the near-total destruction of West Africa’s forests. Ivory Coast and Ghana stand as a cautionary tale of what could happen in other countries where cocoa is spreading, if the industry does not reform its practices. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">After our report in the fall of 2017, <A href=""https://www.idh<mark>sustainable</mark>trade.com/initiative/cocoa-and-forests/"">24 leading chocolate companies joined the governments of Ghana and Ivory Coast</A> to commit to No New Deforestation, reforestation, and traceability in West Africa. These companies and the governments have much to do to fulfill these promises. But only a handful of companies have made a global commitment to deforestation-free cocoa. It’s time for the rest of the chocolate industry to do the same.</SPAN></P><P>Olam International and Hershey’s have pledged to zero deforestation for cocoa worldwide effective immediately, and also to agroforestry, and a few more have committed to change soon: Barry Callebaut aims to be deforestation-free for cocoa by 2025 whilst Godiva promised to roll out a cross-commodity No Deforestation policy – that includes cocoa – soon. Still others like Mondelez have committed to No Deforestation Cocoa for several origins beyond West Africa though not worldwide yet. Companies that fight to end deforestation for cocoa and re-green cocoa worldwide are setting a precedent for the industry, going above and beyond the Cocoa &amp; Forests Initiative, and sending a Valentine to endangered animals from Asia to the Amazon.</P><UL><LI><SPAN style=""font-size: 10pt;""><STRONG>Hershey’s: </STRONG>“We are proud to <A href=""https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/02/01/1330335/0/en/The-Hershey-Company-Commits-to-Protect-Forests-in-Cocoa-Growing-Regions.html"">commit</A> to ‘no new deforestation’ in our cocoa supply chain by not sourcing cocoa from anywhere in the world where <EM>new </EM>deforestation has occurred, effective immediately, as well as creating an agroforestry program to support shade-grown cocoa through tree planting programs.”</SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN style=""font-size: 10pt;""><STRONG>Barry Callebaut: </STRONG>“Under our <A href=""https://www.barry-callebaut.com/news/2016/11/forever-chocolate-barry-callebaut-targets-100-<mark>sustainable</mark>-chocolate-2025"">Forever Chocolate</A> sustainability vision Barry Callebaut has committed to become Forest positive and <mark>Carbon</mark> Positive, and to source all our ingredients sustainably, deforestation free, by 2025.”</SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN style=""font-size: 10pt;""><STRONG>Godiva:  </STRONG>“As part of our overarching commitment to enriching our communities and the planet Godiva is updating our Global Supplier Code of Conduct to ensure that our ingredient suppliers across all of our commodities – including cocoa – continue to establish sourcing programs that combat deforestation and forest degradation.”</SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN style=""font-size: 10pt;""><STRONG>Olam International: </STRONG>Olam Cocoa is <A href=""http://olamgroup.com/products-services/confectionery-beverage-ingredients/cocoa/sustainability/tackling-deforestation/"">committed</A> to halting deforestation in its supply chains globally, which includes training farmers on <mark>Climate</mark> Smart practices and rolling out programs for planting shade trees. In Côte d’Ivoire, Olam scaled up recommendations to farmers on the planting of trees – recommending 100 forestry and 50 shade trees per hectare. In its direct sourcing, Olam Cocoa’s goal is for 100% of volumes to be traceable and <mark>sustainable</mark> by 2020.</SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN style=""font-size: 10pt;""><STRONG>Mondelēz: </STRONG>“Since 2012 our ambition is to source all our cocoa sustainably, mainly from Cocoa Life which operates in six countries including Indonesia with an environmental focus that includes No Deforestation for cocoa; we conduct environmental and forest conservation training in all origins where we source cocoa and support shade-grown cocoa, intercropping and agro-forestry and we already conducted a deforestation baseline in Indonesia to monitor deforestation.”</SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN style=""font-size: 10pt;""><STRONG>Halba</STRONG>: Halba doesn’t have a No Deforestation policy for cocoa yet but is working on it; and the company is already committed to offsetting all <mark>CO2</mark> emissions in its supply chain through a reforestation agroforestry project in Honduras; so far Halba planted over 350’000 timber trees in Honduras, Peru and Ghana and committed to agroforestry <STRONG>i</STRONG>n all countries where it purchases cocoa, aiming for 70 shade trees per ha. </SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN style=""font-size: 10pt;""><STRONG>Nestle:  </STRONG>“Nestlé is a <A href=""https://www.nestle.com/ask-nestle/environment/answers/nestle-deforestation"">signatory</A> to the Cocoa &amp; Forests Initiative and we also have a long standing overall no deforestation policy for our key commodities, including cocoa.”</SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN style=""font-size: 10pt;""><STRONG>Unilever</STRONG>: “In terms of global commitments to end deforestation for cocoa, commitment to sourcing 100% of our cocoa sustainably is a global commitment and not geography-specific. Similarly, our global position on eliminating deforestation from our supply chains is not commodity-specific.”</SPAN></LI></UL><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is high time for the whole industry to clean up its act and move fast to implement robust zero deforestation policies worldwide for cocoa – especially those companies that Mighty Earth had already named in our last report as being connected to illegal deforestation cocoa supply chains, with cocoa coming even from inside national parks. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">We’re asking the chocolate industry to

from 1988 to 2008, which equaled approximately 1% of total forest loss.<A href=""#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1""><SUP>[i]</SUP></A> Cocoa represented 8% of deforestation embodied in EU27 net imports of crop products, 1990-2008.<A href=""#_edn2"" name=""_ednref2""><SUP>[ii]</SUP></A> Cocoa is spreading, and as it does, it threatens new forests. “From 2000 to 2014, the global production of cocoa beans increased by 32 per cent – from 3.4 to 4.5 million tonnes – while the land-use footprint of cocoa plantations grew by 37 per cent – from 7.6 to 10.4 million hectares.”<A href=""#_edn3"" name=""_ednref3""><SUP>[iii]</SUP></A> Cocoa production has been growing from 2007 to now in countries like Papua New Guinea, Malaysia, the Dominican Republic, Liberia, Uganda, Colombia, Sierra Leone, likely stressing already vulnerable forests there.</P><P><STRONG>Indonesia</STRONG>: Indonesia is notorious for deforestation for palm oil, timber, and paper. However, cocoa production has been expanding there too, and it is the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> biggest cocoa producer in the world. Between 1988 and 2007, an estimated 0.7 million ha of Indonesian forest were cleared for cocoa production, which equals about 9% of total national deforestation for crops.<A href=""#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1"">[iv]</A> The deforestation shown in our maps above is in the “cocoa island” of Sulawesi, where most of Indonesia’s 850,000 tons of cocoa a year<A href=""#_edn2"" name=""_ednref2"">[v]</A> comes from. In 2017, around 63% of Indonesian cocoa production was concentrated on Sulawesi Island. The provinces within Sulawesi that produce most cocoa are West Sulawesi (18% of Indonesia’s total), South-East Sulawesi (17%) and South Sulawesi (16%).<A href=""#_edn3"" name=""_ednref3"">[vi]</A> An expert told Mighty Earth that with the exception of the alluvial plains in the region North of Mamuju (West coats, facing Borneo) which was partly deforested in the mid 1990s by oil palm companies, almost all the deforestation in Sulawesi is for cocoa, especially in the hills (in general everything beyond 20 km from the coastal line). <A href=""#_edn4"" name=""_ednref4"">[vii]</A></P><P><STRONG>Cameroon: Cocoa is also becoming a driver of deforestation in the Congo Basin, the most intact of the world’s great rainforests. </STRONG>Cocoa beans export statistics from <A href=""http://www.mightyearth.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Copy-of-ITC-Trade-in-Cocoa-Beans-2007-2016.pdf"">ITC</A> show an export increase by Cameroon from 131,075 in 2007 to 263,746 in tons in 2016, suggesting a doubling of cocoa trees were planted (noting that harvests start 3-5 years after planting), some of which was likely in forests. In 2012, Cameroon’s government announced plans to increase cocoa production from around 225,000 tonnes annually to 600,000 tonnes by 2020 – a move which would put more forests at risk. (though according to the director-general of the Cameroon Cocoa Development Corporation, these plans to expand cocoa are falling short).<A href=""#_edn7"" name=""_ednref7""><SUP>[viii]</SUP></A> Already in 2014 over 11% of the land footprint of crop production in Cameroon was for cocoa. The deforestation shown in our maps above is in the Manyu division of South-West Region province of Cameroon. Manyu and Meme are the two divisions in Cameroon with the highest production of cacao.<A href=""#_edn8"" name=""_ednref8""><SUP>[ix]</SUP></A> The South-West Region province is said to produce roughly half of Cameroon’s cacao.<A href=""#_edn9"" name=""_ednref9""><SUP>[x]</SUP></A> Mamfé is the cacao capital of Manyu division. Since November 2016, there have been violent clashes between separatists and security forces. These clashes cut many Cameroonian buyers off from traditional sales routes, and thus some cocoa is reportedly illegally exported to Nigeria.<A href=""#_edn10"" name=""_ednref10""><SUP>[xi]</SUP></A> In neighboring Nigeria, cocoa was estimated to contribute to 8% of national deforestation, 1990-2008.<A href=""#_edn11"" name=""_ednref11""><SUP>[xii]</SUP></A></P><P><STRONG>Peruvian Amazon:</STRONG> Cocoa producers have also turned to South America, especially Peru. Cocoa beans export statistics from <A href=""http://www.mightyearth.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Copy-of-ITC-Trade-in-Cocoa-Beans-2007-2016.pdf"">ITC</A> show an export increase from 4,263 tons in 2007 to 61,888 in 2016. This would indicate a fifteen-fold increase in cocoa production. <A href=""http://maaproject.org/2015/image-9-cacao-tamshiyacu/"">Satellite images in 2012 caught United Cacao red-handed destroying nearly 5000 acres of land for a cocoa plantation, encroaching on the <mark>carbon</mark>-rich, biodiverse Amazon rainforest in Peru.</A> Peru’s cacao planting may have reached 129,842 hectares in 2016.<A href=""#_edn13"" name=""_ednref13""><SUP>[xiii]</SUP></A> The deforestation shown in our maps above was found most in the provinces of Ucayali, Huanuco and San Martin.</P><P><STRONG>Ecuador: </STRONG>Cocoa beans export statistics from <A href=""http://www.mightyearth.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Copy-of-ITC-Trade-in-Cocoa-Beans-2007-2016.pdf"">ITC</A> show an export increase from 80,093 tons in 2007 to 227,214 in 2016 – almost a three-fold increase. The cultivated area of cocoa in the provinces of Sucumbíos, Orellana and Napo increased by 16,600 hectares in 2000-2008.

Their solar car Stella Vie won the title as the most energy-efficient “cruiser class” car. Ericsson is a proud sponsor of Solar Team Eindhoven because we strongly believe that our technology can help bring solar cars closer to everyday reality – an important step toward a world without fossil-fueled transportation.</P><P><STRONG>More than just a car</STRONG>
Stella Vie has space for up to 5 people and it can easily travel 70 km/hour without using the battery, even in cloudy circumstances. Aside from its size, what distinguishes Stella Vie from other solar cars is that it produces more energy than it consumes. This makes Stella Vie much more than just a car – it also functions as an energy generation and storage unit on wheels. One of Ericsson’s key roles in the project has been to provide the intelligence to enable energy upload from the car to the grid (to a home or office site, for example).</P><P>Ericsson has also developed other on-board applications for Stella Vie, such as a solar navigator that provides feedback to the driver about the optimal driving speed and battery usage, as well as suggesting rerouting if the weather changes. We have also created a smart solar parking app that identifies the optimal parking spot based on information about sunshine and shadows caused by surrounding buildings.</P><P>We intend to demonstrate the solar car at side events that are organized along with the annual UNFCCC <mark>Climate</mark> Conference (<A href=""http://newsroom.unfccc.int/cop-23-bonn/"" target=""_blank"">COP23</A>) in Bonn, where we will also promote other <mark>climate</mark>-friendly solutions such as the solar powered radio site.</P><P><STRONG>Growing corporate engagement</STRONG>
It’s encouraging to see more and more traction in the private sector to take responsibility to combat <mark>climate change</mark>. For example, earlier this month I attended an event in Brussels called <A href=""http://europe.solve<mark>climate</mark>change.com/index.php"" target=""_blank"">Companies vs. <mark>Climate Change</mark></A> where I spoke about Ericsson’s programs for <mark>carbon</mark> reduction. I illustrated our achievements with recent examples of projects in the area of Smart Cities and Smart Transport, including Stella Vie. It was interesting to learn about the large degree of commonality with the long-term <mark>climate</mark>-related goals from many different industry leaders, such as Carlsberg, Philips, Proximus, Siemens, Arcelor-Mittal, Lidl and Solvay. Several companies have already set the goal to become <mark>carbon</mark> neutral by 2030, or even 2025. “Reduce emissions where possible, and compensate what you cannot reduce” was a repeated expression.</P><P>The ICT sector will play a very important role to enable a low-<mark>carbon</mark> society. According to an <A href=""https://www.ericsson.com/assets/local/news/2016/03/ericsson-mobility-report-nov-2015.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Ericsson report</A>, <mark>carbon</mark> abatement of ICT solutions can be up to 15% of global <mark>carbon</mark> emission by 2030. This is well illustrated by the many pilots and projects that Ericsson is currently running in Market Area Europe and Latin America. Taking part in solar car projects isn’t just fun, it is also connected to a very serious long-term goal: global <mark>carbon</mark> neutrality.</P><DIV class=""authorArea""><H4>Written by <A href=""https://www.ericsson.com/thecompany/sustainability_corporateresponsibility/technology-for-good-blog/author/patrick-blankers/"" title=""Posts by Patrick Blankers"">Patrick Blankers</A></H4><P>Patrick Blankers is Program Manager Sustainability at Ericsson, in the Market Area Europe and Latin America.

Mercer, chairman of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. Although Firestone will retain a 25 interest in the joint venture, Mr. Mercer believes that Bridgestone will not be a passive investor. Stronger Operations</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""409"" data-total-count=""2454"">The Firestone factories, which mostly produce tires for cars and light trucks, are not as modern as Goodyear's, according to industry analysts and executives. Still, they said, the factories are in much better shape than the La Vergne plant was when Bridgestone bought it. Firestone also holds a much stronger market position in auto tires than it did in the truck radials that it made at the La Vergne plant.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""180"" data-total-count=""2634"">''The whole thing had to be redone'' at La Vergne, said Harvey Heinbach, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Company. ''That's not necessarily going to be required of the other plants.''</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""286"" data-total-count=""2920"">Under Firestone, the La Vergne factory, which opened in 1972, had been plagued by one problem after another. Firestone had designed it to produce about 4,000 tires a day for what was then one of the fastest-growing segments of the tire market: radials for medium- and heavy-duty trucks.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""321"" data-total-count=""3241"">But the plant's output never approached that level, and persistent production and quality problems, coupled with a market slump, had caused daily output to sink to 600 tires in 1982. As a result, more than 400 workers - about a third of the work force - were furloughed during the 1981-82 recession. Severe Labor Problems</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""374"" data-total-count=""3615"">Firestone executives declined to discuss the La Vergne plant. But according to union officials, workers and former managers, the plant suffered from severe labor problems when Firestone owned it. After a tumultuous struggle, the United Rubber Workers won the right to organize the plant's workers in 1979. A bitter three-month strike over a new labor contract then followed.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""279"" data-total-count=""3894"">''There was a lot of violence between management and the union in those days,'' said a former Firestone manager at the plant. ''There were incidents of rocks being thrown through windows and car tires being flattened. It seemed like the whole operation was going downhill fast.''</P><DIV id=""story-ad-2"" class=""story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ""><DIV class=""accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden""><P>Advertisement</P></DIV><A class=""visually-hidden skip-to-text-link"" href=""#story-continues-4"">Continue reading the main story</A></DIV><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""341"" data-total-count=""4235"" id=""story-continues-4"">Labor relations remained bad after the strike, workers and former managers said. ''Firestone only cared about numbers and money,'' said Larry R. Pierce, an engineer with 15 years at the plant. ''Even if you had a suggestion that could improve the operation, they wouldn't pay attention to it. You were the workers and they were the bosses.''</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""663"" data-total-count=""4898"">In the early 1980's, Firestone decided to shrink its whole tire business, which was ailing. Although the market for medium- and large-truck radials seemed promising, John J. Nevin, who had become chief executive of Firestone in 1980, believed that the company could not afford the big investments in product development and new capacity needed for it to be a major competitor in the business. $52 Million Sale So in 1982, he agreed to sell the La Vergne factory to Bridgestone for $52 million. The Japanese company, which already had 8 percent of the American market for such radials, was eager to capitalize on its reputation for producing high-quality products.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""262"" data-total-count=""5160"">The deal not only gave Bridgestone its first manufacturing facility in the United States but also provided it with a much larger distribution system. Bridgestone agreed to supply truck radials to Firestone's extensive network of outlets for at least three years.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""387"" data-total-count=""5547"">Even before it agreed to buy the plant, Bridgestone officials were aware of its problems. ''The plant was not qualified to make Bridgestone tires,'' said Kazuyuki Hirai, executive vice president of Bridgestone U.S.A. who moved here from Tokyo to run the factory. ''Productivity was extremely low and there was a negative history with the union. We saw that we had to make many changes.''</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""271"" data-total-count=""5818"">To insure that it had the freedom to make changes, Bridgestone said it would not acquire the plant unless workers agreed to more flexible work rules - which ranged from staffing levels to scheduling to the number of tasks a given worker could perform.

Whether it’s genetically modified natural rubber from trees, plant-based rubber produced from weeds, or recycled rubber manufactured from frozen used tires, scientists are developing a myriad of options to replace conventional tire materials and get us on the road to smarter technologies for the future.</EM></P><P><STRONG>Genetic Improvements for Natural Rubber Tires from Hevea brasiliensis Trees</STRONG>
	Natural rubber is a latex polymer with abundant characteristics that make it ideal for use in the automotive tire industry. It’s highly elastic, flexible, resilient, impact resistant, and is efficient at heat dispersion. Some say it’s irreplaceable. As such, even synthetic rubber cannot compare when it comes to natural rubber for tires, especially those used in the aircraft and truck industries.
	However, today, the Hevea brasiliensis species, the tree species responsible for most of natural rubber production the world, is under increasing stress. Pathogens and fungal diseases threaten growth of these trees, <mark>climate change</mark> creates difficulties for trees growing in Asia and South America, and challenges related to the breeding of the trees because of the limited genome-based information have all slowed the ability of growers to increase their crops.
	As such, many groups are working on advancing the way rubber trees are bred and grown in order to produce rubber specifically designed for the tire industry. Of significant importance has been the mapping of the genome, which is required to accelerate the genetic improvement of the species in order to increase breeding and exploitation of genetic resources.
	To make this a reality, The <mark>Bridgestone Corpo</mark>ration has been working on the genome sequence for Hevea brasiliensis. Bridgestone, along with Genome Informatics Laboratory in the National Institute of Genetics (Mishima City, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan), has been tinkering with the genetic makeup of this tree, which is commonly called the rubber tree.
	The aim of this genetics research is to facilitate the development of improved breeding technologies and growing methods for the natural rubber tree in order to improve yield, latex rubber quality, and generate better clones of the trees. Their hope is that their research may also lead to advancements in how well the trees fend of diseases and how well they weather stress such as droughts, floods, and challenging temperature changes such as those associated with <mark>climate change</mark>.
	So far, the Bridgestone Group has decoded 1.4 billion base pairs of this tree’s genome, which is estimated to cover 90 percent or more of the gene sequence of the species. By identifying chromosome-level information about the tree and characterizing molecular markers for various gene traits, they will be able to produce trees with the specific characteristics that will benefit the tire industry, such as disease resistance, higher latex production, and so on, all of which contribute to higher yields.
	This is just one of Bridgestone’s initiatives aimed at developing more <mark>sustainable</mark> products for the automotive industry. After all, the manufacture of synthetic rubber tires must rely on oil supplies since it takes about seven gallons of oil to create one tire (five gallons for feedstock and two gallons for energy to create the tire).  Creating tires with an ever-higher percentage of renewable feedstock, such as that from the natural rubber tree, would reduce the environmental load of the manufacturing of rubber tires. Today a huge percentage of all natural rubber production is sent to create tires and other vehicle components, with 50 percent of all auto tires and 100 percent of all aircraft tires being made of natural rubber.  Bridgestone hopes to develop tires that are made of materials that are 100 percent sustainably sourced in the future.<STRONG>Plant-Based Rubber Alternatives for New Tire Manufacturing</STRONG>
	Yet natural rubber from trees isn’t the only way to create <mark>sustainable</mark> rubber tires. The first prototyped natural latex tires made from Dandelion plants have been produced in Europe, representing a new foray into plant-based tire production. Made from two particular strains of Dandelion – Guayule and Russian to be precise – these new tires have been produced by Dutch tire company Apollo Vredstein.
	Where formerly all natural rubber relied on the Hevea brasiliensis originating from Asia (all natural rubber has to be imported into Europe at the present), giving that region a veritable monopoly on natural rubber, this new type of natural rubber will open up new markets. As part of the EU-PEARLS European project which began four years ago with the aim of developing an alternative to natural rubber, this breakthrough will help to promote latex-producing plants that can be grown in many European countries. The Guayule Dandelion can be grown in Mediterranean areas, whereas the Russian Dandelion is well-suited to northern and eastern areas of Europe.
	That said, more testing of the prototypes will need to be completed before they can enter production. If this type of natural rubber takes off, it would reduce the exceptional strain on the natural rubber tree populations. And while the materials and
	manufacturing of tires account for only 12 percent of their <mark>CO2</mark> emissions (86 percent of a tire’s footprint comes from the fuel consumption of the vehicle), offering the industry a renewable alternative to synthetic tires certainly could help reduce the industry’s <mark>carbon</mark> footprint.
	Another interesting advancement is bio-isoprene. Whereas synthetic tires are made of isoprene derived from crude oil, bio-isoprene is created by an enzyme from bacteria. Developed by researchers at Michigan State University in the biochemistry and molecular biology department, the bio-isoprene has already been introduced into a line of Goodyear’s tires.</P><P>
	Other than the base material required to produce natural rubber tires, companies are also playing with plant-based additives to increase a tire’s efficiency. Yokohama Tire Corporation, for instance, is infusing their AVID Ascend and dB Super E-spec tires with orange oil. Extracted from the peels of oranges and added to natural rubber, this additive is said to improve the performance characteristics of the Ascend tire.
	According to Andrew Briggs, Yokohama director of product planning and motorsports, &quot;There, the orange oil technology makes possible the collective benefits of outstanding grip for all-season handling, long treadlife and great fuel economy. It doesn’t compromise on one while delivering another. The orange oil is the differentiator. &quot;   These tires have been trialed on the racetrack to rave reviews, and have been tested to reduce rolling resistance by 20 percent.
	Similarly, some companies are producing tires infused with sunflower oil, including the MICHELIN Primacy Alpin PA3 and the Primacy MXM4. By substituting sunflower oil for petroleum oil, these tires can also reduce the <mark>carbon</mark> black filler they consume. The plant-based oil also increases traction at low temperatures for better braking and handling in wet conditions as well as light snow conditions. All around, the vegetable oil seems to offer some substantial improvements of petroleum oil-based tires.  <STRONG>Turning to Recycled Powders for Greener Tires</STRONG>
	Perhaps an even better alternative to natural rubber and other plant-based materials for constructing tires is the reuse of secondhand tire materials for making new tires. By and large, used tires are burned for energy, or they collect in giant piles around the world becoming mosquito-breeding grounds and fire hazards. Lehigh Technologies aims to change all of that with their recycled tire powders. A green materials company, LeHigh Technologies is looking to monetize waste rubber in order to make greener tires and take care of the stockpiles of rubber around the world. The Lehigh process involves producing micronized rubber powders (MRPs) which are created by flash freezing small chunks of industrial waste rubber in liquid nitrogen. These chunks are then ground down in a machine to produce a fine powder that can be blended with virgin rubbers and plastics to produce new rubber.</P><P>
	Though only about 7 percent of a new tire will be composed of MRP (truck tires can contain more), manufacturers that use this material can cut virgin material costs by up to 40 percent, and oil consumption is reduced by 0.8 gallons per pound of MPR used (findings which have been independently verified by Georgia Tech). Already more than 140 million tires on the road contain MRP.<STRONG>Are Plants the Way of the Future for Tires?</STRONG>
	The history of the tire centers on trees, but will the future also be focused on plants? If the <mark>innovation</mark>s discussed here are any indication, plants will continue to play a large role in how tires are made and how well they perform. Though it’s unlikely we’ll see mushroom-grown tires like other car components currently in production, the evolution of tire materials looks to be increasingly green.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

	    A look at Bridgestone's new guayule center in Mesa, Ariz.
        </DIV></DIV></A><P>MESA, Ariz.—A 30-year-old prototype truck tire, made entirely from guayule rubber, sits in a prominent place in the reception area of the Bridgestone Biorubber Process Research Center in Mesa. </P><P>The presence of this weathered tire stresses the continuation of <mark>innovation</mark> that began with Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., predecessor of Bridgestone Americas, and continues through the opening of the Mesa center, a state-of-the-art facility dedicated to research and development in guayule as a commercial natural rubber crop. </P><P>“The rubber industry has reached a critical juncture,” said Bill Niaura, director of new business development for Bridgestone Americas, at the Sept. 22 ribbon-cutting ceremony that officially opened the 10-acre guayule research, development and pilot processing complex. </P><P>The new center includes a single-story, 8,300-sq.-ft. office and laboratory building; a 3,500-sq.-ft. shrub prep building; a two-level, 5,500-sq.-ft. building for rubber extraction, co-products and solvent recycling; and a 3,100 sq.-ft. mechanical and electrical building. </P><P>With 97 percent of the world's natural rubber coming from Hevea brasiliensis trees in Southeast Asia, the need for biodiversity and a domestic U.S. source for NR is greater than ever, according to Niaura. “Guayule could be a game-changer for the industry,” he said. </P><P>Other speakers at the ceremony included Yoshi-yuki Morimoto, senior vice president and chief technology officer for <mark>Bridgestone Corp.</mark>; Asahiko “Duke” Nishiyama, executive chairman of the board for <mark>Bridgestone Corp.</mark>; Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett; Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz.; and Mesa Mayor John Giles. </P><P>The center operates in close collaboration with Bridgestone's 281-acre Agro Operation Guayule Research Farm in Eloy, Ariz. Both operations employ a total of 30, according to Niaura. Bridgestone did not make public the amount it has invested in those operations. </P><P>The Mesa center and the Eloy farm are part of the research initiative Bridgestone announced in 2011 to diversify the world's NR supply, according to company publicity. That initiative in turn is part of Bridgestone's long-term vision of manufacturing products from fully renewable and <mark>sustainable</mark> raw materials by 2050, it said.</P><H3>History, <mark>innovation</mark>, sustainability</H3><A href=""/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/RN/20141008/NEWS/310069999/H2/0/H2-310069999.jpg&amp;cci_ts="" target=""_blank""><DIV class=""captioned-photo  right""><DIV class=""caption"">

        </DIV></DIV></A><P>The effort to commercialize guayule goes back more than a century, when small businesses along the Rio Grande on the Mexico-Texas border sprung up to extract NR from guayule. </P><P>However, those businesses failed after they had exhausted the supply of wild guayule plants in the area. Not only that, but they destroyed important cultivars that set guayule back for many years, according to Dave Dierig, director of the Agro Operation Guayule Research Farm. </P><P>During World War II, the federal government funded the Emergency Rubber Project in response to Japan cutting off NR supplies to the U.S. ERP agronomists were successful in planting thousands of acres of guayule and extracting high-quality rubber from it; however, once the war ended, the government had the guayule plants destroyed. </P><P>In the face of spiraling oil and synthetic rubber prices in the 1970s, Congress passed a law in 1978 mandating the creation of a domestic guayule rubber industry. In the 1980s, Firestone designed and built a pilot guayule processing plant for the project, which was centered at Sacaton, Ariz. Results were encouraging, but for various reasons the Sacaton project ended. </P><P>“Half the rubber from Sacaton went to Firestone to make truck tires, and half of it went to Goodyear to build nose gear tires for the F-16 fighter plane,” Niaura said. </P><P>Bridgestone learned a great deal from Firestone's experiences of three decades ago, he said. But meanwhile both the agronomy and the technology have advanced tremendously over that time, he said. </P><P>The company broke ground on the Mesa research center in late May of 2013, according to Niaura. While guayule fits perfectly into Bridgestone's biodiversity and sustainability goals, those things are not enough to make guayule viable, he said. </P><P>“The challenge is to keep the performance,” he said. “We seek better performance, both manufacturing facilities and for end-users.”</P><P>Since guayule is only 6 to 10 percent rubber, Niaura said, Bridgestone must find profitable uses for the rest of the plant. He compared guayule commercialization with a pork processing plant, “using every part of the pig except the squeal.”</P><P>Bagasse—a term borrowed from the sugar cane industry—is the woody part of the guayule shrub, and it has several possible applications, according to Niaura. </P><P>“You can take bagasse and make briquettes from it,” he said. Guayule briquettes are low-sulfur and <mark>carbon</mark>-neutral, but also relatively low-return, he said. </P><P>Through pyrolysis or fermentation, higher-value applications for bagasse are possible, Niaura said. These might include bio-char for soil filtration, boiler fuel, or even low-grade bio-oil, gasoline or diesel fuel.</P><H3>Plants and rubber</H3><A href=""/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/RN/20141008/NEWS/310069999/H3/0/H3-310069999.jpg&amp;cci_ts="" target=""_blank""><DIV class=""captioned-photo  right""><DIV class=""caption"">

        </DIV></DIV></A><P>Guayule is a challenging plant to grow and cultivate, because of its abnormalities, according to Dierig. </P><P>“Certain guayule plants are diploids, which means they reproduce in the normal, sexual way,” he said. “But others can have four, five, six, even eight sets of chromosomes, and they have clone-type reproduction. You can't tell just by looking at them which is which. </P><P>“This creates complications in breeding the plant, because you can only cross-pollinate with diploids,” Dierig said. </P><P>Up to now guayule has only been planted by transplanting seedlings, according to Dierig. This is expensive—three or four cents per seedling—which is why much of the research at the farm in Eloy is concentrating on direct seeding, he said. </P><P>“You can harvest a guayule plant in three years, but we hope to get it down to two,” he said. </P><P>Besides improving guayule genetics, developing best growing practices and providing biomass for the Mesa center, Dierig and his team on the Eloy farm are in contact with local farmers to develop working relationships that will lead to their taking on guayule as a cash crop, he said. </P><P>Meanwhile, the Mesa center expects to produce its first samples of guayule rubber this fall, with pilot-scale production beginning in early 2015. </P><P>“We're talking tens of pounds of rubber per day, not hundreds or thousands,” Niaura said. </P><P>Bridgestone plans further scaling-up of the pilot plant in 2016, on the way to planned full commercialization of guayule in the early 2020s, he said.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""right-column""><DIV class=""relatedStoriesWrapper""><SECTION><H1>Related Articles</H1></SECTION></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

We plan to cut GHG emissions by 65 percent across our operations, known as Scope 1 and 2, and, for the first time work with suppliers, known as Scope 3, to help reduce their emissions by 50 percent by 2050.  We recognize the interconnected and inter-reliant nature of our business with suppliers, farmers, customers, consumers and governments. These types of commitments require cooperation across the full supply chain. That is the only way we can truly be successful.”</P><P>The 114 companies that have agreed to set science-based targets represent at least $932 billion USD in total combined profits (2014) – greater than the GDP of Indonesia. Almost a quarter of the companies who have signed up are from the US, with the UK, France, and Canada being the next most common home locations.</P><P>“We want to have a positive impact on people and the planet, and that includes going ‘all in’ to tackle <mark>climate change</mark>. We’ve made good progress in reducing emissions and have invested EUR 1.5 billion in renewable energy since 2009.

Manufacturers use synthetic rubber in toys and rubber bands and even passenger car tires, but higher performance products such as truck and aircraft tires demand the natural stuff. The problem is, almost all the natural rubber in the world comes from a single species of tree, <EM>Hevea brasiliensis, </EM>crops of which cannot be scaled up easily to meet future demand. So the tire industry, seeking a new source of natural rubber, has turned to a species that was last used in World War II: a flowering shrub known as <EM>Parthenium argentatum, </EM>or guayule.</P><P>Threats to the <EM>Hevea</EM> tree from <mark>climate change</mark> and disease are driving the push to find new sources of natural rubber. The crop is particularly vulnerable because the plants used commercially are mostly clones of one another. Simply growing more of the trees is not the solution. South American leaf blight, which spreads from tree to tree, makes it impossible to grow <EM>Hevea</EM> in single-crop fields in Brazil, where the species originated. And Asia, where 93 percent of the world’s natural rubber is produced, is under pressure to preserve rainforest, not clear more of it for crops. &quot;These areas are undergoing changes, which put pressure on the value of land and labor,&quot; says Bill Niaura, director of new business development at Bridgestone Americas, a subsidiary of the Japan-based tire giant.&quot;That drives the price up. At a certain threshold it makes sense to look for alternative sources.&quot; To that end Bridgestone Americas has opened up an experimental factory in Arizona to extract natural rubber from locally grown guayule.</P><P>Guayule has a number of advantages over <EM>Hevea.</EM> As a desert plant, it requires relatively little water compared with other crops and it can grow in wide swaths of the U.S. In addition, its greater genetic diversity affords better protection against diseases, none of which are transmitted as easily as the leaf blight that attacks <EM>Hevea.</EM></P><P>Unlike <EM>Hevea,</EM> guayule can be harvested with machinery. Because <EM>Hevea</EM> stores rubber just under the bark, growers must extract the tree’s rubber by scoring the tree by hand and allowing the rubber to drip into a bucket. Guayule, in contrast, stores rubber in its cells, which means growers can extract the substance by crushing the whole shrub and separating the particles of rubber from the rest of the biomass with the aid of a solvent—a far more efficient process.</P><P>In the 1930s and 1940s the U.S., Germany and the Soviet Union all looked for alternatives to <EM>Hevea</EM> to use in everything from tires to gas masks. The research became more urgent after Southeast Asia fell to the Japanese, and Brazil’s production was unable tokeep up with the demand. The Soviet Union studied a dandelion called <EM>Taraxacum kok-saghyz</EM> whereas the U.S. focused on guayuleand Nazi scientists researched synthetic compounds.</P><P>After the war, Asian rubber came back on the market and the U.S.'s own wartime research hadsucceeded in developing synthetic compounds, so guayule fell by the wayside. Subsequent attempts to revive the use of guayule have focused on small-scale, specialty products; Yulex Corp., for example, partners with manufacturers to make hypoallergenic gloves and a wet suit.</P><P>But tire manufacturing consumes some 70 percent of the world's rubber supply, so interest from the industry means the demand will better support guayule development, says Yulex CEO Jeff Martin. &quot;This kind of big capital investment is necessary,&quot; he observes. &quot;You need interest from the big companies.&quot;</P><P>For its part, Bridgestone Americas does not expect to produce enough guayule-based rubber to be commercially viable for several years. Its primary focus for nowis to refine the manufacturing techniques.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In great condition. Gorgeous scenic views. We already knew it was in a biologically rich area and in close proximity or adjacent to several other protected lands on the Cumberland Plateau. We felt it needed to be protected, and we hoped that maybe we could help Bridgestone with management of these forests. Little did we know then what our relationship would lead to.” On April 25, 2018, <STRONG>Bridgestone Americas Inc. announced the donation of all</STRONG><STRONG><A href=""/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/tennessee/bridgestone-reserve-at-chestnut-mountain-map.pdf"" target=""_blank"">5,763 acres</A> of the company’s Chestnut Mountain property to The Nature Conservancy</STRONG>. The property, which will be known as the Bridgestone Nature Reserve at Chestnut Mountain, is located in White County on the <A href=""/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/tennessee/explore/cumberland-plateau.xml"" target="""">Cumberland Plateau</A>, 80 miles east of Nashville. It is the largest donation in the history of The Nature Conservancy in Tennessee. TNC will manage <STRONG>a <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration project on the property</STRONG> that will offset the <mark>carbon</mark> emissions of the Bridgestone Tower, the company’s corporate headquarters in downtown Nashville, for years to come. “We applaud Bridgestone for its commitment to the environment,” says Terry Cook, State Director for The Nature Conservancy in Tennessee. “We are honored that Bridgestone has entrusted The Nature Conservancy with the management of this important forest.” The property’s namesake, Chestnut Mountain, is the highest peak in White County, with an elevation of about 2,000 feet. The nature preserve includes mixed hardwood and pine forests, wooded mountain gulfs, caves, the headwaters of the Caney Fork River and Billy Branch Lake, which provides drinking water for communities in the area.</P><H5>A Haven for Rare Species</H5><P>The Firestone tire company had acquired the property in the early 1970s as a potential corporate retreat, and when Bridgestone acquired Firestone in 1988 it kept the property undeveloped and protected. That was fortunate and far-sighted. The <STRONG>Bridgestone Nature Reserve at Chestnut Mountain provides habitat to more than 100 species of conservation</STRONG> concern, including the golden eagle, the Eastern slender glass lizard, the barking tree frog and the green salamander. Rare plants found there include Cumberland rosemary and white prairie clover. The area is also known habitat for turkey, quail, deer, bobcat, red and gray foxes and beaver. In addition, the property is part of <A href=""/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/tennessee/bridgestone-reserve-at-chestnut-mountain-map.pdf"" target=""_blank"">a mosaic of 60,000 acres</A> protected public lands on the Cumberland Plateau that includes <A href=""https://www.tn.gov/environment/program-areas/na-natural-areas/natural-areas-middle-region/middle-region/na-na-virgin-falls.html"" target=""_blank"">Virgin Falls State Natural Area</A>, <A href=""https://tnstateparks.com/parks/about/fall-creek-falls"" target=""_blank"">Fall Creek Falls State Park</A>, Bledsoe State Forest and the 10,000-acre <A href=""http://www.tnwatchablewildlife.org/watchareadetails.cfm?uid=09072216143715780&amp;region=Bridgestone-Firestone_Centennial_Wilderness&amp;statearea=East_Tennessee"" target=""_blank"">Bridgestone/Firestone Centennial Wilderness</A>, which Bridgestone donated to the state of Tennessee in 1998-2000.<STRONG>Plans for the Bridgestone Nature Reserve at Chestnut Mountain will include low-impact public access</STRONG> and the creation of connector trails between Chestnut Mountain and the other protected lands in the area. The Nature Conservancy will develop a master plan for public access first.</P><H5>Outgrowth of Collaboration</H5><P>The property donation is a natural outgrowth of a collaboration between Bridgestone and TNC. In 2014,<STRONG> the two organizations began working together on a comprehensive forest management plan</STRONG> for the property, which has included protective treatments for its hemlock trees to fight the hemlock woolly adelgid pest and restoration of native shortleaf pine stands on selected areas. In the Southeast, shortleaf pine forests have declined by more than 50 percent in the past 30 years. Restoring these trees <STRONG>will help re-establish habitat for ground-nesting birds like bobwhite quail</STRONG> and other species. With the help of TNC, Bridgestone had enrolled the property in Forest Stewardship Council certification, one of the highest standards of forest management for <mark>sustainable</mark> forest products. Plans for the property include <mark>sustainable</mark> management of the forest in addition to the <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration program.“Prior to our involvement, this forest had not seen much disturbance in terms of fire or active management,” says Trish Johnson, Director of Forest Protection for TNC in Tennessee. <STRONG>“Active management of this forest will strengthen its overall health</STRONG> and resilience to <mark>climate change</mark>. It also provides a great opportunity to do shortleaf pine restoration.”“If we had first visited this property a decade ago, we might have said simply, ‘Great forest! Big trees! Let’s just leave it alone and protect it,’” says Alex Wyss. “But in recent years, conservation science has shown that sometimes forests like this have lost key components, especially with an over-suppression of natural fires. Pine-oak woodlands and savannahs with native grasses and wildflowers are native habitats that we have lost in many places but that we can bring back.  Make no mistake: Chestnut Mountain has lots of healthy forest, but it doesn’t have all the species that should be there. We can help that.”  Trish Johnson also thinks it’s significant that the natural splendor of Chestnut Mountain will no longer be a well-kept secret: “I suspect that when Firestone bought this property in the 70s, they recognized the beauty of this landscape and wanted to preserve it. That was a good thing. <STRONG>But now all the citizens of Tennessee will be able to enjoy it.</STRONG> And that’s even better. The vision for this property has changed, and for the better for everybody.” </P></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

This year, 2,025 companies, representing $30 trillion in market capitalization, disclosed their water management performance – nearly twice as many as in 2015. A major incentive for companies to disclose to CDP is that such disclosure has been requested by more than 800 investors with over $100 trillion in assets under management.</P><P>Companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of water in regards to their business models and <mark>climate</mark> goals. CDP also released its <mark>climate</mark> analysis, Picking Up the Pace, this week, which shows that 89% of the highest valued companies disclosing to CDP, have put in place emissions reduction targets in 2017 – up from 85% last year.</P><P>CDP is the creator of the Science Based Targets initiative, which helps companies work toward their <mark>climate</mark> goals by aligning their <mark>carbon</mark> emission reductions in line with what <mark>climate</mark> models say is necessary to keep global temperature rise well below 2°C. “From to Coca-Cola to Goldman Sachs, some of the world’s highest profile companies are driving forward change. And where they lead, others are sure to follow,” the report says.</P><P> </P><H3><STRONG>Case Study: Unilever</STRONG></H3><P>Unilever is one company that has announced its <mark>climate</mark> goals of reducing emissions from energy by 40% per metric ton of production by 2020 compared with 2008. It met that target four years early, when it achieved a 43% reduction.</P><P>A big part of the reason was the rapid growth of renewable energy. At the start of this program, Unilever’s use of renewable energy across its manufacturing operations stood at 15.8%, but with the increased availability of renewable energy sources and the growth of renewable energy certification schemes, 31.6% of the energy the company was using was from renewable sources by the end of 2016.</P><P>“Reaching our original target four years early gave us the confidence to commit to an even more ambitious <mark>Carbon</mark> Positive program,” says Jeff Seabright, chief sustainability officer of Unilever. That program involves: increasing energy efficiency, building on a 24% reduction in energy use per unit of production since 2008; sourcing all the electricity it buys from the grid from renewables by 2020; eliminating coal from all direct and indirect sources of energy by that date; and going 100% renewable in its operations by 2030.</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV class=""homepage-whitepaper-block""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col col-sm-6""><DIV class=""white_paper_title""><STRONG>Powerful Byte - Strategies to Ingest, Digest High-Frequency Data</STRONG></DIV><DIV class=""white_paper_sponsor""><SPAN class=""white_paper_sponsor_by"">Sponsored By: Sphera Solutions</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""col col-sm-6""><DIV class=""white_paper_title""><STRONG>Real-Time Data as a Foundation to Drive Sustainability Performance</STRONG></DIV><DIV class=""white_paper_sponsor""><SPAN class=""white_paper_sponsor_by"">Sponsored By: Sphera Solutions</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col col-sm-6""><DIV class=""white_paper_title""><STRONG>Stormwater Management Programs: How to Integrate New Technologies to Improve Processes and Operations</STRONG></DIV><DIV class=""white_paper_sponsor""><SPAN class=""white_paper_sponsor_by"">Sponsored By: VelocityEHS</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""col col-sm-6""><DIV class=""white_paper_title""><STRONG>Just the Facts: 8 Popular Misconceptions about LEDs &amp; Controls</STRONG></DIV><DIV class=""white_paper_sponsor""><SPAN class=""white_paper_sponsor_by"">Sponsored By: Digital Lumens</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The vast majority of the world's <mark>climate</mark> scientists — estimated at 97 percent by NASA — agree that <mark>climate change</mark> is real, immediate, and largely caused by human activity.  </P><P>According to the National Academy of Sciences, our <mark>climate</mark> is already warming, and continuing the current emissions path will heat our planet by 4 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century. The overwhelming scientific consensus warns of a barrage of tragedies, from reduced food and water supply, extreme weather events, increases in disease, and other disasters as the delicate balance of planet Earth is forever altered. While Citibank recently estimated the cost of <mark>climate change</mark> to be more than $40 trillion, more important is the key operative word — <EM>forever</EM>.  We likely will never be able to return our Earth to the way it is today.    </P><DIV id=""dfp-ad-mosad_1-wrapper"" class=""dfp-tag-wrapper wrapper""><DIV id=""dfp-ad-mosad_1"" class=""dfp-tag-wrapper""><SPAN>ADVERTISEMENT</SPAN></DIV></DIV>The risk management equation is both straightforward and compelling. To put this in the context of running a large company, if 97 percent of experts warned that unless certain steps were taken there would be a significant risk of large explosions at a company's manufacturing facilities, the CEO would be compelled to act on the warning. If the strategy were to merely hope that the experts were wrong and the explosions occurred, the chief executive would lose his job and might, depending on the details, face dire legal consequences. <P><mark>Climate change</mark> is no different. If we do not act now and the science proves even largely right, we will have lost the opportunity to manage our risk. Doing nothing or very little means betting that most of the world's scientists are fundamentally wrong. It is an all or nothing bet with the only planet we have, a bet no sensible person would make. We hope that the scientific community is just plain wrong, but hope is not a strategy. The only rational response is to manage the risk. </P><P>Many companies have come out in support of serious action to fight <mark>climate change</mark> – including Goldman Sachs, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Apple, Google, and Wal-Mart. Three-hundred and sixty-five companies have signed a letter supporting the EPA’s Clean Power Plan regulations. Perhaps most telling, six major oil companies, including Shell and BP, have come forward and acknowledged <mark>climate change</mark>’s likely reality and human cause, and have urged the adoption of a price on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. We, as tire companies, do the same. </P><P>While our companies are each making significant strides in reducing our own <mark>carbon</mark> footprints and will continue to drive improvements, there must be a far greater coordinated regulatory framework and investments in green technologies if the risk is to be effectively managed. Although we are comparatively large companies, compared to the whole picture, we are too small to move the needle.  </P><P>The agreements made during the recent Paris <mark>climate change</mark> talks are a laudable step. The United States sent a strong signal by establishing ambitious but achievable emission reduction targets and demonstrating leadership in Paris. We urge that the United States now not only hold fast to its commitments, but also use its economic might to drive strengthened commitments over time and follow through from other countries around the globe, by implementing a transparent reporting framework to ensure nations live up to their commitments. Moreover, the United States should adopt appropriate policies and regulations, including establishing a <mark>carbon</mark> pricing mechanism, to create a level playing field and invest in the development of scalable clean energies for tomorrow.     </P><P>If the science proves right, and we do not act, how do we possibly explain our current strategy of hopeful denial to at-risk future generations? Conversely, if the United States, as one of the world’s leading and most ingenious countries, unleashes its full potential — as it has to overcome other great challenges in the past — it has the opportunity to produce enormous long-term technological and economic advantages. More importantly, it just might be the driving force needed to avoid the vast economic, social and human damage of <mark>climate change</mark> predicted by the world’s experts. That would be a worthy accomplishment for any generation of Americans.</P><P><EM>Garfield is CEO and president of Bridgestone Americas, Inc.;</EM><EM>Selleck is chairman and president of Michelin North America, Inc.;</EM><EM>Dinelli is chairman and CEO of Pirelli Tire North America Inc.; Hawk is chairman of Toyo Tire Holdings of Americas, Inc.; and Fushimi is CEO and president of Yokohama Tire Corporation.</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""bottom-story-socials"" class=""blogs-social-wrp""><DIV class=""share""><A href=""mailto:?subject=TheHill.com%3A%20Major%20tire%20execs%20call%20for%20strong%20action%20on%20<mark>climate</mark>&amp;body=From%20TheHill.com%3A%20%0A%0AThe%20risk%20management%20equation%20is%20both%20straightforward%20and%20compelling.%0A%0Ahttp%3A//thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/264133-major-tire-execs-call-for-strong-action-on-<mark>climate</mark>"" class=""email""> </A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

CEOs at Ford, Goldman Sachs, Nike, and Starbucks spoke out against them.</P><P>When Indiana and North Carolina curbed anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, leaders of big companies strongly objected. PayPal <A href=""http://hrc-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com//files/assets/resources/NC_CEO_Letter_%283%29.pdf"">canceled plans</A> to expand in North Carolina, and the NBA moved its all-star game out of Charlotte.</P><P>But as President Trump prepares to back away from the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement, roll back the Obama administration’s signature <mark>climate change</mark> initiatives, and appoint an Environmental Protection Agency administrator who has repeatedly fought the agency, the leaders of corporate America have for the most part been muted or silent.</P><P>This poses a problem for environmentalists and their allies in Congress, particularly on the <mark>climate</mark> issue. </P><P>U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and a persistent advocate for <mark>climate change</mark> action, puts it this way: “One of the dirty secrets that we have to live with is that even the good-guy corporations don’t show up in Congress to lobby for doing something about <mark>climate change</mark>. Collectively, they do zero or less than zero to support <mark>climate</mark> legislation… That leaves the field to the bad guys.” </P><P>Without support from business, the environmental movement will struggle to defend itself against what David Goldston, director of government affairs for the Natural Resources Defense Council, calls an “incredible onslaught from both Congress and the administration.” What’s more, if environmentalists are to have any chance of convincing the federal government to enact stronger laws or regulations to curb <mark>climate change</mark> — a long shot, admittedly, for now — they will need big companies to use their political clout to turn around the Republicans who control Congress and the White House.</P><P>The reluctance of Fortune 500 companies to speak up on behalf of environmental protection is striking because it comes after decades of efforts by environmental nonprofits, ranging from The Nature Conservancy to Greenpeace, to develop partnerships with business. This work has paid off: Many companies have pledged to reduce their own <mark>carbon</mark> footprints, curb waste, and buy renewable energy. But few are willing to spend political capital on behalf of the environment.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">Why aren’t companies “speaking out more against the Trump administration’s ‘alternative facts’ on <mark>climate</mark>?”</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>The nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA is a case in point. “He’s not just bad on one thing,” says Fred Krupp, president of the business-friendly Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). “He’s bad on everything.” It’s the first time that EDF has campaigned against an EPA nominee, but the group has few business allies in the battle.</P><P>Tom Murray, an EDF vice president who works closely with business, says he hopes that “pragmatic business voices” will eventually step up to influence the Trump administration. “At this point, however, companies are hanging back on engaging in policy and politics,” he says. “Companies are trying to make sense of the new political landscape, concerned about becoming the president’s next social media target, and enticed by the potential of regulatory and tax reform.”</P><P>A business affiliate of the Natural Resources Defense Council called E2 (it stands for “environmental entrepreneurs”) did put together a letter from “<A href=""https://members.e2.org/jsp/controller?docName=petition(AlertPruittNomEPA)"">500 business leaders</A>” who oppose Pruitt, but the signatories include a registered nurse, a physical therapist, and not a single big-company CEO. </P><P>Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director, says big business needs to step up. “It simply makes no sense that big companies like Coke, Microsoft, Google, and other companies that care about and are doing great things with clean energy and sustainability aren’t speaking out more against the Trump administration’s ‘alternative facts’ on <mark>climate change</mark> and a national energy plan that will only increase our dependence on fossil fuels,” he says.</P><P>Worse, at least for environmentalists, some companies are actively turning against their erstwhile allies. Two days after Trump was elected, the Alliance of American Automobile Manufacturers, which represents Ford and General Motors, among others, urged the president’s transition team to roll back stringent fuel economy rules that were agreed to by the carmakers early in the Obama years. Environmentalists were stunned.</P><P>Says Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a nonprofit alliance of environmentalists and investors: “General Motors is doing a lot of good things on waste, they’re committed to 100 percent renewables, they’re supportive of the Paris talks. But on fuel economy standards, they like this new administration.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">In 2016, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google all donated more money to Republicans than Democrats.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>Meantime, as the political winds have shifted rightwards, so have campaign contributions from corporate political action committees (PACs). In 2016, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google — all of which had previously favored Democratic congressional candidates over Republicans — donated more money to Republicans than Democrats. Congressional Republicans have united to oppose plans to regulate the greenhouse gases that cause <mark>climate change</mark> since 2008.</P><P>All of this means that, when it comes to <mark>climate change</mark>, the loudest business voices in Washington belong to the fossil fuel industry and powerful trade associations, notably the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, that have staunchly opposed <mark>climate</mark> regulation. The chamber’s board includes executives from Accenture, Allstate Insurance, AT&amp;T, Caterpillar, Dow Chemical, FedEx, Florida Power &amp; Light, and Pfizer, all of which have pledged to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions. Public pension funds and so-called socially responsible investors have <A href=""http://www.ott.ct.gov/PolicyAndEducation/LettertoCompaniesAddressing<mark>Climate</mark>Change.pdf"">called on chamber members</A> to “address any misalignment between their own positions and actions on <mark>climate change</mark> and their funding of the chamber’s actions,” to little apparent effect.</P><P>To be sure, some big companies have backed up their <mark>climate change</mark> rhetoric with action in Washington. In 2009, Apple left the U.S. chamber over its <mark>climate change</mark> position and Nike resigned from the chamber board, citing the <mark>climate</mark> issue. Last year, Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft filed a legal brief in federal court supporting the EPA’s Clean Power Plan. General Mills, Mars, and Starbucks have lobbied side-by-side with Ceres on <mark>climate</mark> issues. </P><P>Since the election, Ceres, World Wildlife Fund, and a group called We Mean Business recruited a large number of small companies and a small number of large ones — Campbell Soup, DuPont, Gap, General Mills, HP, Intel, Kellogg, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mars, Mondelez, Monsanto, Staples, Starbucks, and Unilever, among them — to <A href=""http://www.low<mark>carbon</mark>usa.org/"">sign a letter</A> asking the new administration to affirm its commitment to the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement.

In a statement, Google explained its donations to Republican <mark>climate</mark> skeptics by saying: “Google engages on a wide variety of public policy issues and we work with policymakers and advocacy groups across the political spectrum. We’re never going to agree 100% with every organization or policymaker on every issue.” </P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">Corporations do not want to become a target of a president who is willing to call out individual companies by name.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>Gary Garfield, who recently retired as CEO of Bridgestone Tire, is one chief executive who did step up, wrangling senior executives in the tire industry to call for strong <mark>climate</mark> action. But he says environmental issues aren’t a priority for many CEOs because, unlike immigration or gay rights, they do not directly affect company employees. CEOs don’t want to unnecessarily aggravate political allies, shareholders, or employees over an issue that “doesn’t really directly affect their business,” he notes.
  </P><P>The Trump presidency complicates the calculus for businesses that need to manage an array of Washington issues, insiders say. “Companies absolutely care about <mark>climate change</mark>, but they care about other things too,” says Ceres’ Lubber. “They are balancing and juggling.” Corporations want Trump and the Republican Congress to support corporate tax cuts and infrastructure spending, and they do not want to become a target of a president who has been willing to call out individual companies by name. 
  </P><P>“Companies see a bully in the schoolyard, and they are off in the corner, doing their homework, and hoping the bully picks on someone else,” says Aron Cramer, the president and CEO of BSR, a network of businesses dedicated to sustainability. But, he says, business leaders understand the importance of <mark>climate policy</mark>, and they will speak up: “The underlying fundamentals will cause business to sustain their <mark>climate</mark> commitments and ultimately to be more vocal about those commitments.”

What does hockey have to do with environmental policy? Well, for one thing, the game is played on ice. And frozen ponds, where so many of the league’s players learned to skate, are in trouble. The average length of the skating season may shrink by a third in eastern Canada and by 20% in western Canada in coming decades.</P><P class=""p-text"">That’s according to research in the NHL’s 2018 sustainability report, which will be released Wednesday morning. The report assesses the league’s own environmental impact and its commitment to fighting <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P class=""p-text"">Allen Hershkowitz, founding director and chairman of the Board of Sport and Sustainability International, credits the NHL for using that term — <mark>climate change</mark> — at a time when the Trump administration walked away from the 195-nation Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord, and when Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt has said <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is not a primary contributor to global warming.</P><P class=""p-text"">“It would be dishonest not to acknowledge that the report is coming out when the world is facing the most challenging political <mark>climate</mark> in the United States as it relates to <mark>climate</mark>-change policies,” says Hershkowitz, whose non-governmental organization has members in more than 50 countries.</P><P class=""p-text"">Leagues prefer to stay far away from controversy so as not to alienate even a small number of fans; just ask the NFL, where players kneeling for the national anthem last season caused considerable outcry. But Hershkowitz says <mark>climate change</mark> is about science, not politics.</P><P class=""p-text"">Even so, does the NHL worry about disaffecting any fans who may think otherwise?</P><P class=""p-text"">“What I would say is when we do this work, we try to do it as apolitically as possible,” says Omar Mitchell, NHL vice president for corporate social responsibility, “because at the end of the day, as our commissioner would say, this is the right thing to do.”</P><P class=""p-text"">More than a dozen federal agencies issued a report late last year that said humans are the dominant cause of a rise in global temperatures that has led to the warmest period in the history of civilization. That report said global average temperatures have increased 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 115 years.</P><P class=""p-text"">That’s a period of time that encompasses the rise of hockey. The NHL celebrated its centennial in 2017 — and wants to be around for its bicentennial some 100 years hence.</P><P class=""p-text"">“How we think about our environment and how we think about sustainability is going to be a critical element in making sure our sport has a future,” says Kim Davis, NHL executive vice president of social impact, growth initiatives and legislative affairs.</P><P class=""p-text"">According to last year’s Environment Gallup Poll Social Series survey, 59% of Americans agreed that protection of the environment should be given priority even at the risk of limiting the amount of energy supplies, up from 41% who agreed in 2011. And 56% said protection of the environment should be prioritized over economic growth.</P><P class=""p-text"">The NHL’s report is voluntary. “And what gives the report its teeth is that we did a <mark>carbon</mark> inventory” of the league’s own environmental impact, Mitchell says. “Hockey is a very energy-intensive sport. Our analysis shows about 66% of our <mark>carbon</mark> footprint is attributed to energy usage to create an ice sheet. So what we are trying to do is to promote <mark>innovation</mark>s that will lower energy consumption within our buildings.”</P><P class=""p-text"">The league launched its NHL Green initiative in 2010 and issued its first sustainability report in 2014. Among highlights of this second report:</P><UL><LI>The NHL reduced energy consumption 1% from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2016 by using more efficient lighting, enhanced building management systems, waste heat recapture technologies and onsite renewable energy generation. </LI><LI>The NHL has a waste diversion rate of 32% due to composting, improved concessions forecasting and enhanced waste tracking; half of the league’s arenas compost their own waste.</LI><LI>The NHL decreased water consumption 7% from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016 through water-stress solutions including fixture upgrades in arenas and installation of smart sensors in water irrigation systems.</LI><LI>The NHL reduced <mark>CO2</mark> emissions by 2% year-over-year from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2016 through <mark>innovation</mark>s and efficiencies.</LI><LI>The NHL counterbalanced 963,200 megawatts of energy since 2014 through the investment of renewable energy credits generated from U.S. wind and Canadian biomass.</LI></UL><P class=""p-text"">“The single most important thing the NHL has done is measure, and refine the measurement protocol, for professional sports,” Hershkowitz says. “It can’t be understated how important that is, (measuring) energy use, water use and waste generation at arenas that you don’t own and that you occupy for only a fraction of the time. And making an accurate assessment of your contribution to the problem and then reporting it through protocols that are approved by international certifying agencies.”  </P><P class=""p-text"">The league calls March its “NHL Green” month — and not because of St. Patrick’s Day. The NHL Greener Rinks Initiative was launched in 2016 to measure and evaluate the environmental impact of the roughly 4,800 indoor rinks in North America.</P><P class=""p-text"">“This community rink infrastructure is typically outdated and older,” Mitchell says. “And because we’re at the top of the ice hockey community here in North America, we want to take a leadership position to advance <mark>sustainable</mark> best practices” to help operators of these rinks reduce their energy and operating costs to increase access to the sport.</P><P class=""p-text"">“We can only do so much at the league level and on our clubs and our arena partners to impact our <mark>carbon</mark> footprint,” Mitchell says. “But if we can influence the 76 million fans who watch our sport, that’s where you’re going to have real change.”</P><P class=""p-text""><SPAN class=""exclude-from-newsgate""><STRONG style=""margin-right:3px;"">MORE: </STRONG><A href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2018/03/28/tanks-for-nothing-some-nhl-teams-cant-win-for-losing/33348775/"">Tanks for nothing: Some NHL teams can't win for losing</A></SPAN></P><P class=""p-text"">One section of the NHL’s report, titled “Play It Forward,” asks its fans to take a page from the league’s playbook and bring some of the NHL’s sustainability strategies to their lives. The NHL and the Bonneville Environmental Foundation donate 1,000 gallons of water to rivers with critically low flow for every goal scored in the regular season (an initiative called Gallons for Goals) and the league asks its fans to use an online water footprint calculator to estimate their own total water use.</P><P class=""p-text"">Fans donated 4,245 pounds of used equipment during the league’s centennial year, including helmets, skates and pads. The idea was to keep the equipment out of landfills and get it back into use. </P><P class=""p-text"">“As we look forward to the next 100 years,” Davis says, “I think this report shows a very keen focus on how do we ensure that our game is an enjoyable family experience for every stakeholder — for kids, for parents, for coaches.”</P><P class=""p-text"">Scott Jenkins is general manager of Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta and is also chairman of the Green Sports Alliance, which includes nearly 500 sports teams and venues from 15 sports leagues in 14 countries. The alliance brings together team executives, venue operators and environmental scientists to develop solutions and better practices for the environmental challenges that teams and leagues face. Jenkins says the NHL was the first league to have all of its teams as members of the alliance.</P><P class=""p-text"">He says sports teams are in favorable position to influence the broader culture on environmental concerns and to show that being environmentally sensitive is good for business.</P><P class=""p-text"">“We can’t afford to live on the sidelines,” Jenkins says. “We have to get in the game.”</P><P class=""p-text"">Which brings us back to frozen ponds. The NHL’s sustainability report tells of RinkWatch, which encourages citizens to monitor outdoor rinks and ponds in their neighborhoods. The initiative was launched by researchers at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ont., in 2013. More than 1,400 rinks and ponds are being tracked today, helping scientists to study the long-term effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P class=""p-text"">“If you trace (hockey) back to the sort of humble beginnings, particularly in Canada, it all goes back to frozen ponds,” Davis says. “A  lot of NHL players grew up playing hockey outdoors. It’s such a critical part of the game and it's important that access remains available for future generations.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Murray says that a thriving economy actually depends on a thriving environment, and that US businesses must take the lead now that the current administration is striving to shift environmental protections.</P><P>Corporate sustainability has gone from simple operational efficiencies to global supply chain collaborations over the past 25 years, he wrote. The EDF encourages businesses to continue to raise the bar and offers three suggestions.</P><P>First, think big, set goals, drive <mark>innovation</mark>, achieve big results, and tell the world. Meaningful business results can be delivered when businesses commit to aggressive, science-based sustainability goals.</P><P>Walmart’s director of energy and operations sustainability Joby Carlson, for example, told Energy Manager Today that the company strives “not to do anything that doesn’t have a good financial return. Sustainability has to hit the balance among the economics, the environmental, and the social side. Energy efficiency has been our bread and butter. We are a low-cost retailer so we are sensitive about the cost of operations. Optimizing and reducing our energy demand has translated into millions and millions [in savings].” In the case of the company’s trucking fleet, it is saving a billion dollars a year based on fuel efficiency compared with 2005, he said.</P><P>The next step in raising the bar for continuing to support clean energy is to collaborate with others in order to scale their efforts. By combining business practices with other companies and organizations, businesses can drive efficiencies and boost the bottom line.</P><P>For example, General Motors announced last week that it will seek to <A href=""https://www.environmentalleader.com/2017/05/gms-move-source-<mark>sustainable</mark>-tires-knocks-supply-chain-risk/"">source only <mark>sustainable</mark> rubber</A> for tires, not just within its own supply chain but across the industry. The automaker is working with Bridgestone, Continental, Goodyear and Michelin to “solve the challenges of transparency and traceability in a complex value chain,” GM’s senior VP of global purchasing and supply chain told Environmental Leader. By working with its supply base to source <mark>sustainable</mark> tires in a strategic, collaborative way, he said, the company can ensure volume meets growing global demand through improved yields, Environmental Leader wrote last week.</P><P> </P><P>Finally, Murray says, businesses should publicly continue to support <mark>climate change</mark> policy. So far, large corporations have seemed eager to do so. <SPAN class=""s2"">“</SPAN><SPAN class=""s1"">It’s imperative that businesses take an active role in meeting the goals set out by the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement,” said Anna Walker, senior director of global policy and advocacy at <A href=""https://low<mark>carbon</mark>usa.org/business%20365%20businesses"">Levi Strauss &amp; Co.</A> earlier this month. “It will be critical that we work together to ensure the US maintains its <mark>climate</mark> leadership, ultimately ensuring our nation’s long-term economic prosperity.” And s</SPAN><SPAN class=""s1"">uch companies as <A href=""https://www.environmentalleader.com/2017/04/many-companies-urge-trump-stand-<mark>carbon</mark>-cutting-policies/"">Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft</A> have responded to positively to continued support of the <mark>climate</mark> pact, saying that <mark>carbon</mark> reduction strategies would boost investment in renewable energy while beefing up American competitiveness, <mark>innovation</mark> and job growth. </SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">Just after Trump was elected, 365 companies ranging from Nike to Levi Strauss to General Electric sent the president a letter emphasizing their commitment to<A href=""https://www.environmentalleader.com/2017/05/trump-weighs-us-involvement-<mark>climate</mark>-accord-corporations-turn-heat/""> reducing heat-trapping emissions. </A></SPAN></P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P>In the meantime, <A href=""http://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">We Mean Business</A>, a coalition of more than 100 companies advocating bold action on <mark>climate change</mark>, terminated a contract with Edelman last fall after controversy arose over the firm’s work for fossil fuel industry clients, a spokesman for the coalition confirmed. </P><P>Nike declined to use Edelman on a <mark>climate</mark>-related project, said sources at both companies who spoke on condition of anonymity. And Unilever, a major client, also has expressed concern to Edelman over the <mark>climate</mark> issue, and is reviewing its relationship with the PR firm, sources said.</P><P>None of this will have much immediate financial impact on Edelman, which has more than 5,500 employees and reported <A href=""http://www.edelman.com/who-we-are/the-details/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">worldwide revenues of $768m in the 2014 fiscal year</A>. But the loss of the executives, who are well known in the world of corporate responsibility, could impact client business – and, at minimum, dent Edelman’s reputation.</P><P>The departures illustrate the challenges faced by PR firms, as well as professional services firms in such fields as accounting, law and management consulting, as they try to straddle the <mark>climate</mark> debate. Edelman has struggled for the last year to serve its fossil fuel industry clients, including Shell and Chevron, without putting off other clients or staffers who see <mark>climate change</mark> as a moral issue with clear rights and wrongs. </P><P>Richard Edelman, the firm’s CEO and the 61-year-old son of its founder, Daniel Edelman, has told colleagues that he wants to boost the firm’s revenues to $1bn. Turning away business won’t help him achieve that goal; indeed, in the public relations business, controversial clients can often be very lucrative. That said, Edelman has strict policies against working for tobacco companies and gun manufacturers.</P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-3 | 2""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">Minister worked as spin doctor for tobacco giant that paid workers £15 a month</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P>On <mark>climate</mark>, though, Edelman resembles most global PR companies who want to play on both sides of the debate over what to do about <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. <A href=""http://www.burson-marsteller.com/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Burson-Marsteller</A>, a unit of communications giant WPP, helped design an ambitious campaign touting coal as a solution to poverty alleviation for Peabody Coal, which opposes any form of <mark>climate</mark> regulation.</P><P><A href=""http://fleishmanhillard.com/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">FleishmanHillard</A>, a unit of Omnicom, has worked for the anti-regulation American Petroleum Institute (API). At the same time, <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/<mark>sustainable</mark>-business/2014/oct/06/-sp-millenials-business-coke-pepsi-nestle-<mark>climate</mark>-change-collectively"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">WPP and Omnicom</A> joined forces last year to help build <A href=""https://collectively.org/en/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">collectively.org</A>, a digital platform urging young people to take action against <mark>climate change</mark>, albeit with such anodyne messages as “<A href=""https://collectively.org/en/article/we-need-to-get-better-at-talking-about-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">We Need to Get Better at Talking About <mark>Climate Change</mark></A>” and “<A href=""https://collectively.org/en/topic/<mark>climate</mark>-change-is-real/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Synchronized Swimmers Want You To Know One Thing About <mark>Climate Change</mark></A>”.</P><P>Historically, Edelman has positioned itself as a different kind of PR firm: family-owned, less subject to the short-term earnings pressures of its rivals, and driven by a sense of purpose and a desire to make a difference in the world. Just last month, <A href=""http://www.edelman.com/post/richard-edelman-depaul-university-commencement-speech/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Richard Edelman told graduates of DePaul University’s communications school</A> to “make communications marketing your version of The Avengers, the force for good aspiring to change the world”.</P><P>As perhaps the world’s best known PR guru and a regular at the World Economic Forum’s Davos confab, Richard Edelman frequently talks about the company’s work on behalf of Walmart’s sustainability initiatives, GE’s Ecomagination campaign and CVS’ decision to stop selling cigarettes. In a blog post headlined <A href=""http://www.edelman.com/p/6-a-m/<mark>climate</mark>-change-imperative/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">The <mark>Climate Change</mark> Imperative</A>, Edelman described a dinner at the home of his Harvard University classmate Jeffrey Sachs, the director of Columbia University’s Earth Institute, saying he had “made a strong case for private sector involvement” in the process of deeply reducing <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.</P><P>His company’s <A href=""http://www.edelman.com/who-we-are/values-and-mission/edelmans-position-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">formal position on <mark>climate change</mark></A> is more ambiguous.</P><P>In August, a survey by the <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>investigations.org/pr_industry_<mark>climate</mark>_change_survey"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""><mark>Climate</mark> Investigations Center</A> – a small NGO run by former Greenpeace USA research director Kert Davies – spotlighted Edelman’s work for API and the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), which vehemently oppose regulation of <mark>climate</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>; the Alliance for Northwest Jobs and Export, which pushed on behalf of the coal industry and railroads for coal-export plants opposed by environmentalists; and TransCanada, which was <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/business/pr-firm-urges-transcanada-to-target-opponents-of-its-energy-east-pipeline.html?_r=0"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">advised by Edelman</A> to take aim at environmental opponents of its Energy East pipeline. (<A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>investigations.org/edelman_fired_by_transcanada"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">TransCanada subsequently ended its relationship with Edelman</A>. Edelman also no longer works for API.)</P><P>In response, Edelman released a statement saying it will not “<A href=""http://www.edelman.com/who-we-are/values-and-mission/edelmans-position-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">accept client assignments that aim to deny <mark>climate change</mark></A>”. But the statement does not preclude Edelman from advising fossil fuel clients on campaigns to oppose <mark>climate</mark> regulation, or to support projects such as Shell’s arctic drilling or the exploitation of the Canadian tar sands that would make the <mark>climate</mark> problem worse. Edelman says only that its clients must commit to “<A href=""https://www.edelman.com/who-we-are/values-and-mission/statement-of-purpose/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">fact-based, truthful and transparent communications</A>”.</P><P>Edelman executives declined to elaborate on the firm’s <mark>climate</mark> position. Questions to Edelman were referred to a spokesman, Chris Allieri, who declined to comment, except to say that Edelman does not currently represent coal-industry clients.</P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-3 | 3""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">World's biggest PR firm calls it quits with American oil lobby – reports</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

Their clients included Hewlett Packard, The North Face, PwC, Starbucks, Unilever and the We Mean Business coalition, which was put together by executives from Ikea, Nike, The B Team, BSR, Ceres and The <mark>Climate</mark> Group.</P><P>Some clues about where Edelman is headed can be gleaned from a new set of values and a <A href=""https://www.edelman.com/who-we-are/values-and-mission/statement-of-purpose/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">statement of purpose</A> published last month.

I am a businessman who had the great fortune of leading a $15 billion, 55,000-person international company for nearly seven years.I made some good decisions and some not so good decisions, but, given that profits grew five-fold in six years, I think it is fair to say that I was successful in that role. It is in that vein — businessman to businessman — that I draft this letter.First, congratulations on your election. Now, with your first day in office imminent, there is undoubtedly intense pressure to create immediate change. However, decisions affecting the long-term resilience of our economy and our planet justify great deliberation, not haste.As President of the United States, your greatest responsibility will be to protect our country. This includes not just military challenges, but all threats. As a fellow business person who also understands the need to manage risk, I ask you to take the threat of <mark>climate change</mark> seriously. I urge you to consider the economic and scientific facts before pulling the U.S. out of the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement.A hasty decision on this issue, will likely isolate our nation, cede technology, <mark>innovation</mark> and jobs to China, and limit market access for our exporters.Before making such decisions, please take time to discuss it with a wide range of experts. The United States has many of the greatest research and academic institutions in the history of the world — Harvard, Yale, the University of Pennsylvania and Stanford to name just a few. Ask some of these great institutions to send their leading experts in the area of <mark>climate change</mark> and economics to meet with you for one hour.Discuss with them the science of <mark>climate change</mark>, why they believe it is man-induced, and its likely consequences to the United States. Ask them whether the <mark>climate</mark> is changing at the rate predicted by their models and how much time we have for the global community to get it right.Then, ask them to address the economic consequences of ignoring <mark>climate change</mark> as well as the economic opportunity for America if we were to take the lead in advancing clean energy.A decision to stay the course on <mark>climate</mark> and institute policies harnessing American ingenuity to create truly efficient clean energy technology — akin to the effort behind the Manhattan Project — will help drive both jobs and our economy for decades to come.Clean energy industries currently provide over 2.5 million Americans with well-paying jobs, and China is poised to create over 13 million such jobs. America also stands to become a net exporter of clean energy technology, and over 630 leading businesses have publicly urged their support for a low <mark>carbon</mark> economy.Right now America has the opportunity to be a global leader for clean energy, or to surrender that leadership position to Europe and China which currently outspend us on that technology. Because of both the urgency and long-term economic and other broad-ranging consequences of <mark>climate change</mark>, your decision on this issue is likely to determine your legacy.Moreover, respectfully, you owe it to your electorate, not to mention your grandchildren, to meet with the leading scientists and economists in the country before making such a consequential decision.</P></DIV></LI></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""testmionals parallax""><DIV class=""hometitle"">Testimonials</DIV><DIV class=""container""><DIV class=""owl-carousel testmionalsScript""><DIV class=""item""><DIV class=""description"">Gary Garfield recently spoke to our students at Fisk University and the response was overwhelming.

It is a great privilege and responsibility to manage the assets clients have entrusted to us, most of which are invested for long-term goals such as retirement. As a fiduciary, BlackRock <A href=""/corporate/about-us/investment-stewardship"" title=""Learn how we protect our clients' assets for the long term."">engages with companies</A><SPAN> </SPAN>to drive the <mark>sustainable</mark>, long-term growth that our clients need to meet their goals.</P><P>In 2017, equities enjoyed an extraordinary run – with record highs across a wide range of sectors – and yet popular frustration and apprehension about the future simultaneously reached new heights. We are seeing a paradox of high returns and high anxiety. Since the financial crisis, those with capital have reaped enormous benefits. At the same time, many individuals across the world are facing a combination of low rates, low wage growth, and inadequate retirement systems. Many don’t have the financial capacity, the resources, or the tools to save effectively; those who are invested are too often over-allocated to cash. For millions, the prospect of a secure retirement is slipping further and further away – especially among workers with less education, whose job security is increasingly tenuous. I believe these trends are a major source of the anxiety and polarization that we see across the world today.</P><P>We also see many governments failing to prepare for the future, on issues ranging from retirement and infrastructure to automation and worker retraining. As a result, society increasingly is turning to the private sector and asking that companies respond to broader societal challenges. Indeed, the public expectations of your company have never been greater. Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society. Companies must benefit all of their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate.</P><P>Without a sense of purpose, no company, either public or private, can achieve its full potential. It will ultimately lose the license to operate from key stakeholders. It will succumb to short-term pressures to distribute earnings, and, in the process, sacrifice investments in employee development, <mark>innovation</mark>, and capital expenditures that are necessary for long-term growth. It will remain exposed to activist campaigns that articulate a clearer goal, even if that goal serves only the shortest and narrowest of objectives. And ultimately, that company will provide subpar returns to the investors who depend on it to finance their retirement, home purchases, or higher education.</P><H2>A new model forcorporate governance</H2><P>Globally, investors’ increasing use of index funds is driving a transformation in BlackRock’s fiduciary responsibility and the wider landscape of corporate governance. In the $1.7 trillion in active funds we manage, BlackRock can choose to sell the securities of a company if we are doubtful about its strategic direction or long-term growth. In managing our index funds, however, BlackRock cannot express its disapproval by selling the company’s securities as long as that company remains in the relevant index. As a result, our responsibility to engage and vote is more important than ever. In this sense, index investors are the ultimate long-term investors – providing patient capital for companies to grow and prosper.</P><P>Just as the responsibilities your company faces have grown, so too have the responsibilities of asset managers. We must be active, engaged agents on behalf of the clients invested with BlackRock, who are the true owners of your company. This responsibility goes beyond casting proxy votes at annual meetings – it means investing the time and resources necessary to foster long-term value.</P><P>The time has come for a new model of shareholder engagement – one that strengthens and deepens communication between shareholders and the companies that they own. <A href=""/corporate/literature/press-release/2017-ldf-ceo-letter.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Read Larry Fink’s 2017 corporate governance letter to CEOs."">I have written before</A><SPAN> </SPAN>that companies have been too focused on quarterly results; similarly, shareholder engagement has been too focused on annual meetings and proxy votes. If engagement is to be meaningful and productive – if we collectively are going to focus on benefitting shareholders instead of wasting time and money in proxy fights – then engagement needs to be a year-round conversation about improving long-term value.</P><P>BlackRock recognizes and embraces our responsibility to help drive this change. Over the past several years, we have undertaken a concentrated effort to evolve our approach, led by<SPAN> </SPAN><A href=""https://www.blackrock.com/investing/biographies/michelle-edkins"" target=""_blank"" title=""Read Michelle Edkins's full biography."">Michelle Edkins</A>, our global head of investment stewardship. Since 2011, Michelle has helped transform our practice from one predominantly focused on proxy voting towards an approach based on engagement with companies.</P><P>The growth of indexing demands that we now take this function to a new level. Reflecting the growing importance of investment stewardship, I have asked<SPAN> </SPAN><A href=""/corporate/about-us/leadership/barbara-novick"" title=""Read Barbara Novick's full biography."">Barbara Novick</A>, Vice Chairman and a co-founder of BlackRock, to oversee the firm’s efforts. Michelle will continue to lead the global investment stewardship group day-to-day. We also intend to double the size of the investment stewardship team over the next three years. The growth of our team will help foster even more effective engagement with your company by building a framework for deeper, more frequent, and more productive conversations.</P><H2>Your strategy, your board, andyour purpose</H2><P>In order to make engagement with shareholders as productive as possible, companies must be able to describe their strategy for long-term growth. I want to reiterate our request, outlined in past letters, that you publicly articulate your company’s strategic framework for long-term value creation and explicitly affirm that it has been reviewed by your board of directors. This demonstrates to investors that your board is engaged with the strategic direction of the company. When we meet with directors, we also expect them to describe the Board process for overseeing your strategy.</P><P>The statement of long-term strategy is essential to understanding a company’s actions and policies, its preparation for potential challenges, and the context of its shorter-term decisions. Your company’s strategy must articulate a path to achieve financial performance. To sustain that performance, however, you must also understand the societal impact of your business as well as the ways that broad, structural trends – from slow wage growth to rising automation to <mark>climate change</mark> – affect your potential for growth.</P><P>These strategy statements are not meant to be set in stone – rather, they should continue to evolve along with the business environment and explicitly recognize possible areas of investor dissatisfaction. Of course, we recognize that the market is far more comfortable with 10Qs and colored proxy cards than complex strategy discussions. But a central reason for the rise of activism – and wasteful proxy fights – is that companies have not been explicit enough about their long-term strategies.</P><P>In the United States, for example, companies should explain to investors how the significant changes to tax law fit into their long-term strategy. What will you do with increased after-tax cash flow, and how will you use it to create long-term value? This is a particularly critical moment for companies to explain their long-term plans to investors. Tax changes will embolden those activists with a short-term focus to demand answers on the use of increased cash flows, and companies who have not already developed and explained their plans will find it difficult to defend against these campaigns. The U.S. tax bill is only one such example – regardless of a company’s jurisdiction, it is your responsibility to explain to shareholders how major legislative or regulatory changes will impact not just next year’s balance sheet, but also your long-term strategy for growth.</P><P>Where activists do offer valuable ideas – which is more often than some detractors suggest – we encourage companies to begin discussions early, to engage with shareholders like BlackRock, and to bring other critical stakeholders to the table. But when a company waits until a proxy proposal to engage or fails to express its long-term strategy in a compelling manner, we believe the opportunity for meaningful dialogue has often already been missed.</P><P>The board’s engagement in developing your long-term strategy is essential because an engaged board and a long-term approach are valuable indicators of a company’s ability to create long-term value for shareholders. Just as we seek deeper conversation between companies and shareholders, we also ask that directors assume deeper involvement with a firm’s long-term strategy. Boards meet only periodically, but their responsibility is continuous. Directors whose knowledge is derived only from sporadic meetings are not fulfilling their duty to shareholders. Likewise, executives who view boards as a nuisance only undermine themselves and the company’s prospects for long-term growth.</P><P>We also will continue to emphasize the importance of a diverse board. Boards with a diverse mix of genders, ethnicities, career experiences, and ways of thinking have, as a result, a more diverse and aware mindset. They are less likely to succumb to groupthink or miss new threats to a company’s business model. And they are better able to identify opportunities that promote long-term growth.</P><P>Furthermore, the board is essential to helping a company articulate and pursue its purpose, as well as respond to the questions that are increasingly important to its investors, its consumers, and the communities in which it operates. In the current environment, these stakeholders are demanding that companies exercise leadership on a broader range of issues. And they are right to: a company’s ability to manage environmental, social, and governance matters demonstrates the leadership and good governance that is so essential to <mark>sustainable</mark> growth, which is why we are increasingly integrating these issues into our investment process.</P><P>Companies must ask themselves: What role do we play in the community? How are we managing our impact on the environment? Are we working to create a diverse workforce? Are we adapting to technological change? Are we providing the retraining and opportunities that our employees and our business will need to adjust to an increasingly automated world? Are we using behavioral finance and other tools to prepare workers for retirement, so that they invest in a way that will help them achieve their goals?</P><P>As we enter 2018, BlackRock is eager to participate in discussions about long-term value creation and work to build a better framework for serving all your stakeholders. Today, our clients – who are your company’s owners – are asking you to demonstrate the leadership and clarity that will drive not only their own investment returns, but also the prosperity and security of their fellow citizens.

The FIA, the governing body of motor sport, has established a Commission for Global Road Safety that aims to set the policy agenda for road safety in poor countries.<SUP><A href=""#ref1"" rid=""ref1"" class="" bibr popnode"">1</A></SUP> Formula One's ability to access and influence leading political figures has undoubtedly raised the profile of road traffic crashes as a global public health crisis, but the policies it promotes are neither the most effective in preventing injury, nor the most environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark>.</P><P id=""__p3"">World-wide, road traffic crashes kill about 1.2 million people each year and injure over 50 million.<SUP><A href=""#ref2"" rid=""ref2"" class="" bibr popnode"">2</A></SUP> Most of the injuries are in poor countries and most of the victims are pedestrians and cyclists—and the carnage continues to grow. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), road deaths in poor countries will rise by over 80% by 2020. The cost of traffic injuries in low and middle income countries is already estimated at $65 billion, more than the total amount they receive in development aid.<SUP><A href=""#ref2"" rid=""ref2"" class="" bibr popnode"">2</A></SUP></P><P id=""__p4"">The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, better known as the FIA, is the governing body of motor sport.<SUP><A href=""#ref3"" rid=""ref3"" class="" bibr popnode"">3</A></SUP> It was set up in 1904 and represents the interests of motoring organizations and car users worldwide. In 2001, it established the FIA Foundation, a charity with the stated aim of ‘promoting road safety, environmental protection and <mark>sustainable</mark> mobility.’ Last year, the FIA set up a Commission for Global Road Safety with a remit to ‘examine the framework for and level of international cooperation on global road safety and to make policy recommendations.’ The Commission is chaired by former UK Defence Secretary, Lord Robertson, and at its inception had eight commissioners, one from each of the G8 group of wealthy nations.</P><P id=""__p5"">In terms of ‘representing the interest of motoring organizations’ one could not imagine a more able group of Commissioners. Canada is represented by an Executive Director at General Motors, Japan by a Board Member of the <mark>Bridgestone Corpo</mark>ration, the major trans-national tyre maker. Russia is represented by the President of the Russian Automobile Federation and Italy by a former president of the Automobile Club of Italy. Michael Schumacher represents Germany and France is represented by Gerard Saillant, Deputy President of the FIA Institute, another FIA creation and responsible for the medical aspects of Formula One. The UK Commissioner is the Chief Economist at Lehman Brothers, a US investment bank with financial links to Formula One. The US Commissioner is Director of the Global Road Safety Forum, an organization funded by the FIA and one of the ‘implementation partners’ that the Commission works with. The Commission's Patron is Prince Michael of Kent, a former racing driver, now a member of the British Racing Drivers Club and the Bentley Drivers Club. Lord Robertson himself is Deputy Chairman of the Board of TNK-BP, a Russian oil company. According to the Lords’ Register of Interests, which shows that the FIA paid for Robertson to attend the 2006 Monaco Grand Prix, the Commission meets at the races.</P><P id=""__p6"">Writing in the Guardian for UN Road Safety Week, Schumacher expressed his delight at being part of the ‘independent’ Commission for Global Road Safety and his optimism for improving road safety in poor countries.<SUP><A href=""#ref4"" rid=""ref4"" class="" bibr popnode"">4</A></SUP>‘In my racing career, I survived some very high speed impacts. I am still alive because the sport's governing body designed a system where safety is a prime consideration.’ Schumacher failed to point out a key difference between the grand prix circuit and roads in poor countries—there are no pedestrians, cyclists or children on the track in motor sport.</P><P id=""__p7"">Working through the Commission, the FIA and the car lobby have manoeuvred themselves into a leading role in global road safety. They aim to set the policy agenda for road safety, which would give them considerable influence in global transport policy. They do not intent to fund road safety efforts themselves but will dictate how other organizations spend their money, and in particular how development money is spent. Former World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz has already confirmed the Bank's willingness to implement the Commission's recommendations, and UK Secretary for State for International Development Hilary Benn has welcomed the Commission's proposals.<SUP><A href=""#ref1"" rid=""ref1"" class="" bibr popnode"">1</A></SUP></P><P id=""__p8"">Although in poor countries most people will never own a car and most of the victims of traffic crashes are pedestrians, the Commission has worked hard to ensure that the views of the motoring elites dominate transport policy decisions. Unelected, with only token representation from developing nations, the car lobby will dictate how poor countries' governments spend the development loans that their impoverished people will be repaying for decades.</P><P id=""__p9"">The Commission strongly endorses increased road building in poor countries, claiming that this is essential for achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The available evidence suggests otherwise.<SUP><A href=""#ref5"" rid=""ref5"" class="" bibr popnode"">5</A></SUP> A review commissioned by the Department of International Development found little evidence that transport infrastructure induces economic growth, and argued that greater emphasis on transportation services, particularly those based around improving public transport and support for cycling, would be more effective.<SUP><A href=""#ref5"" rid=""ref5"" class="" bibr popnode"">5</A></SUP> The review concluded that high levels of private car use are not ‘financially, socially, or environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark> in a developing country context.’</P><P id=""__p10"">The Commission has, however, drawn attention to the neglect of road safety by the World Bank and recommends that in future 10% of all road infrastructure funding should be committed to safety. For decades the Bank has directed ‘development’ loans into road building with little consideration of the resulting increases in road deaths and injuries.<SUP><A href=""#ref6"" rid=""ref6"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_132647192"">6</A></SUP> Beneficiaries of this road infrastructure spending include large trans-national corporations, most of which are based in the north, as a result of the reduced costs of raw materials and greater access to cheap labour—cheap because it is unfettered by the health and safety legislation that have pushed up labour costs in the north.<SUP><A href=""#ref6"" rid=""ref6"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_132647190"">6</A></SUP> The problem for public health is that the safety policies the car lobby promotes are not particularly effective in preventing injury.</P><P id=""__p11"">Their favourite policy is road safety education. Despite decades of evaluation research, safety education has never been shown to reduce road injury rates, a point emphasized by the WHO in the <EM>World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention</EM>.<SUP><A href=""#ref7"" rid=""ref7"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_132647189"">7</A></SUP><SUP>,</SUP><SUP><A href=""#ref8"" rid=""ref8"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_132647191"">8</A></SUP> Road user education is favoured by the car lobby because it places the responsibility for road traffic injury squarely on the victim and has no impact on industry profits. Its primary purpose is ideological. It sends the message that road space belongs to drivers, and that pedestrians and cyclists must look out or die. This also applies to children, who account for 300,000 of the 1.2 million road deaths each year.</P><P id=""__p12"">Awareness campaigns are another favourite. The Commission is currently promoting the ‘Think Before You Drive’ campaign, supported by the <mark>Bridgestone Corpo</mark>ration, which reminds drivers to use child seats and seatbelts and to check their tyres.<SUP><A href=""#ref3"" rid=""ref3"" class="" bibr popnode"">3</A></SUP> Sensible suggestions though they may be, such exhortations have no discernable effect on road safety. On the other hand, the campaign may improve Bridgestone's corporate image.</P><P id=""__p13"">At first sight there appear to be many different stakeholders in the global road safety policy arena, but more careful examination reveals otherwise. In 1999, the World Bank—arguing that a partnership between businesses, NGOs and governments can deliver worthwhile road safety improvements in poor countries—established a Global Road Safety Partnership (GRSP) which includes General Motors, Ford, Daimler Chrysler, Volvo and the drinks multinationals Bacardi-Martini and United Distillers.<SUP><A href=""#ref9"" rid=""ref9"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_132647193"">9</A></SUP></P><P id=""__p14"">The Partnership's commitment to improving road safety has already been questioned. A 2006 report compared the prevalence of certain key words in GRSP reports to their prevalence in a similar report by the WHO.<SUP><A href=""#ref10"" rid=""ref10"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_132647194"">10</A></SUP> In the GRSP reports there was a systematic neglect of pedestrians and cyclists. In the WHO report, ‘speed limit’ occurred 17 times in every 10,000 words; in the Partnership's reports, just once. ‘Pedestrian’ was used 69 times by the WHO, and 15 times by the Partnership; ‘buses’ and ‘cyclists’ were mentioned 13 and 32 times respectively by the WHO but not once by the Partnership.</P><P id=""__p15"">There are strong ties between the Commission and GRSP. General Motors is represented on the Commission and on the GRSP and David Ward is Secretary of the Commission, Director General of the FIA and on the Executive of the GRSP.</P><P id=""__p16"">The Commission also has influence within the UN Global Road Safety Collaboration. which was established in 2004 in response to a UN resolution on global road safety. The Collaboration is co-ordinated by WHO, but FIA and GRSP are partners. Although it is reassuring that WHO is co-ordinating the UN Collaboration, most WHO road safety staff are funded by the FIA. Indeed, without FIA funding there would be little WHO road safety activity at all. This is remarkable considering that road traffic crashes are second only to HIV/AIDS as a cause of death in young adults in the developing world. The Global Road Safety Forum, another road safety organization claiming a global remit, is also funded by the FIA.</P><P id=""__p17"">The FIA has succeeded in raising the profile of road traffic injuries as a global public health problem at the highest political levels. It has also confronted the development banks with the human cost of road building programmes. But there is a downside to putting the car makers and motorist organizations in the driving seat of road safety policy.</P><P id=""__p18"">Injury is just one of many public health problems arising from increasing motor vehicle use. Transport is 95% oil dependent and accounts for 14% of the greenhouse gas emissions that now threaten the sustainability of the planet. A low-<mark>carbon</mark>, low-energy transportation system with increased levels of walking and cycling and much less car travel is vital in order to avoid catastrophic <mark>climate change</mark>.<SUP><A href=""#ref11"" rid=""ref11"" class="" bibr popnode"">11</A></SUP> This would also tackle road danger at source.</P><P id=""__p19"">Urban air <mark>pollution</mark>, much of which is transport related, causes upwards of 750,000 deaths per year. Reductions in the volume and speed of traffic, particularly in cities, could mitigate <mark>climate</mark> impacts, reduce injury rates and improve air quality. Less traffic would help to raise physical activity levels, thus reducing rates of obesity and diabetes. Reclaiming the streets for walking and cycling is the future of <mark>sustainable</mark> transport—but this will not be in the interests of the car lobby.<SUP><A href=""#ref11"" rid=""ref11"" class="" bibr popnode"">11</A></SUP></P><P id=""__p20"" class=""p p-last"">Formula One has a chequered history in public health. In the nineties, it supported the interests of the tobacco industry when it successfully lobbied the UK Government into scrapping its plans to ban tobacco sponsorship in motor sport.<SUP><A href=""#ref12"" rid=""ref12"" class="" bibr popnode"">12</A></SUP> Big tobacco relished its links with Formula One because of its appeal to teenagers. Getting young people hooked was and still is good for profits, even though smoking will kill one in two of those who maintain the habit. Are we to believe that Formula One has now become a force for good in public health? Surely it is time to establish a truly independent Commission for Global Road Safety that will put the daily toll of 3,000 road deaths before any commercial concerns.</P></DIV><DIV id=""idm140357006089920"" class=""tsec sec""><H2 class=""head no_bottom_margin"" id=""idm140357006089920title"">Notes</H2></DIV><DIV id=""idm140357002829760"" class=""tsec sec""><H2 class=""head no_bottom_margin"" id=""idm140357002829760title"">References</H2><DIV class=""ref-list-sec sec"" id=""reference-list""><DIV class=""ref-cit-blk half_rhythm"" id=""ref1"">1. <SPAN class=""citation"">McMahon K, Ward D. <SPAN class=""ref-journal"">Make Roads Safe</SPAN>.

Haslam, who has until Tuesday to act on the bill, told reporters Thursday that there aren't sanctuary cities in Tennessee, and by his reading, state law bans them. He also said it's not a mass deportation bill. It requires state and local officers to detain immigrants for deportation at the request of federal officials without requiring warrants or probable cause.</P><P>MEMPHIS, Tenn.

Eventually, many areas of the country will be faced with consistently chilly, even sub-freezing temperatures.</P><P>This time of year serves as a reminder that a drop in tire inflation pressures corresponds with the falling thermometer readings. Goodyear experts explain that air pressure in a tire typically goes down 1-2 pounds for every 10 degrees of temperature change.</P><P> “Odds are that many motorists haven’t checked their tire pressure since the weather began turning cooler. If the last time the tire pressure was checked was during the heat of summer, with temperatures around 80 or 90 degrees, many people could soon be riding on severely underinflated tires without realizing it,” said Gary Medalis, Goodyear brand general manager.  </P><P>Maintaining proper air pressure is the single most important thing drivers can do for their tires. Underinflation is the worst enemy a tire can have, as it causes increased treadwear on the shoulder area (outside edges) of the tire. It also generates excessive heat, and it can reduce fuel economy by increasing rolling resistance – because soft tires make the vehicle work harder. </P><P>Goodyear suggests checking tire inflation at least once per month with a reliable gauge. To find the proper air pressure for a tire, look in the vehicle owner’s manual, in the glove box or on the driver’s side door jamb. Hint: The inflation pressure stamped on the sidewall of a tire is the “maximum” pressure, not the “recommended” pressure. </P><P>“Even though consumers can simply and quickly check the air pressure of their tires, it becomes a neglected practice by many,” Medalis said.“That’s too bad, because the four patches of rubber that come in contact with the road surface are vitally important to the performance of the vehicle. They are key for acceleration, lateral traction and braking grip.”</P><P>The evolution of in-dash tire pressure monitor systems on new vehicles will likely help more consumers to pay attention to their tires’ pressure levels. Still, Medalis urges the old-fashioned method of checking tire inflation. </P><P>“At least once a month, take a few minutes and check your tire pressure with an accurate tire gauge. You can’t tell if a tire needs air just by looking. It could be underinflated by 10 pounds and still look fine,” he said. </P><P>For more information about Goodyear tires, visit <A href=""/"">www.goodyeartires.com</A>.</P><P>                                                                                               -0-</P><P>Note to editors: News releases and downloadable photos are available at Goodyear’s media website, <A href=""/"">www.GoodyearNewsRoom.com</A>.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Photo: Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids Video</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>After a multi-million dollar PR campaign touting their charitable work failed to improve their image, the executives at Philip Morris Companies have decided on a wholesale corporate makeover, centered around a name change to the lofty sounding Altria.</P><P>Gone will be the two-headed deer crest familiar to millions of tobacco addicts. In its place will be a mosaic logo reminiscent of a Rubik's Cube-perhaps to represent their diverse (and non-cigarette) interests. It's a dramatic, creative move, and P.M. executives hope they can convince the public that they are something other tobacco merchants.</P><P>The November 16th 2001 announcement comes on the heels of what has widely been seen as a failed $250 million dollar corporate image advertising campaign, which highlighted the company's charitable contributions and downplayed the deadly and addictive tobacco products that built the company. After spending the quarter billion dollars ceaselessly touting their philanthropic efforts, the tobacco giant still ranked second to last -- beating only exploding tire maker Bridgestone Firestone -- in the in a survey of corporate reputations, conducted by The Reputation Institute and Harris Interactive. </P><P>Many observers believe the impetus behind the proposed change is to put distance between the company's lucrative stock and its unseemly tobacco image. The company has long sought to use its vast riches to diversify their product line and public persona in recent years by snapping up family-friendly food and beverage companies like Kraft, Nabisco, and Miller Beer. And, Philip Morris has been aggressively expanding overseas in response to shrinking domestic markets. The company made $5 billion in profits overseas in 1998, versus just $1.5 billion in the US.</P><P>&quot;We are still in the foothills when it comes to exploring the full opportunities of many of our new markets,&quot; explains Philip Morris CEO Geoffrey Bible. Although smoking rates in the US continue to decline, they're exploding across the globe, with the result that deaths from cigarettes will soon become the leading cause of death worldwide.</P><H3>Will the Public Buy the New Name/New Image?</H3><TABLE width=""199"" cellspacing=""7"" cellpadding=""7"" align=""left""><TBODY><TR><TD><P class=""sm"">Plastic Surgery Whitewash. Photo: Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids Video</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>Anti-smoking groups are crying foul, saying the name change is a cynical attempt to distance the company from its tobacco roots without changing its product lines. The tobacco giant's attempt to greenwash its image is the theme of a new animated web cartoon released by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. In the cartoon, the Marlboro Man is on the run down dark alleys, avoiding capture for, as the &quot;Wanted&quot; posters say, the deaths of millions of smokers. After finding a willing plastic surgeon, the familiar icon of the tobacco giant goes under the knife and becomes the pretty, if scarred, little girl named &quot;Altria,&quot; who in spite of the makeover can't stop marketing her products to kids.</P><P>The cartoon highlights the fact that in spite of a 1998 agreement to stop marketing tobacco to children, Philip Morris still does. That same year, their Chinese division was blasted for mailing free cigarettes to minors. Meanwhile, in Albania, Niger and Jordan the company hired underage girls who then gave away free cigarettes to children. </P><P>Now, controversy has followed even the seemingly innocuous move to change the company's name. First came questions over the name Altria itself. The made-up word is a derivation of &quot;altus,&quot; Latin for higher, according to CEO Geoffrey Bible. But experts question Bible's interpretation -- and his motives.</P><P>&quot;Altria, as you know, means nothing, and can't be any derivative of altus --altr -- is a nonexistent stem. But it sounds pretty good, doesn't it? And has no suggestion at all of emphysema or lung cancer,&quot; according to a Latin Professor quoted by TheStreet.com, an investor website.</P><P>Then there were the seemingly self-deceptive reasons behind the change. &quot;The name was chosen to reflect our aspiration to be a financially strong global family of consumer products companies and a commitment to responsible business practices,&quot; noted Bible, who was paid a $5,000,000 salary in 2000. He failed to explain, however, how selling an addictive carcinogenic product was in line with &quot;responsible business practices.&quot; </P><TABLE width=""158"" cellspacing=""7"" cellpadding=""7"" align=""right""><TBODY><TR><TD><P class=""sm"">Altria Playing in the Park. Photo: Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids Video</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>What's more someone else already owns the Altria name. In an if-it-weren't-so-sad-it-would-be-funny bit of irony, the name is already in use by an Alabama based provider of service to physicians and health care companies, Altria Healthcare Corporation. AHC immediately contacted Philip Morris in hopes of getting them to change their plans, to no avail. Sharing a name with a tobacco company would be &quot;kind of a challenge when we're in health care and we're working directly with physicians and hospitals,&quot; according to AHC chairman Warren Smedley. &quot;It would be very, very difficult for us to operate normally with that kind of scenario,'' he added.</P><P>The final decision on whether to change the name will be up to stockholders at their annual meeting April 25th, but Philip Morris is so confident they've already registered and begun using <A href=""http://www.altria.com"">www.altria.com</A></P><P>One question still remains: after having given up their name in a bold new step into the future, any chance they'll also change their famous &quot;MO&quot;, for Marlboro, stock ticker? Don't hold your breath.</P><H3>More Resources</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Meanwhile, the conditions of the farm, mine, or factory where these goods are harvested or produced may be be in high-risk contexts that are dangerous,unregulated, or unsafe, exposing workers, as well as companies to risks. According to the ILO, 24.9 million people are trapped in forced labor globally and 16 million of these individuals are exploited by the private sector.  It is difficult to ascertain how many of these individuals may be associated with the automotive supply chain.</P><UL class=""list""><LI><STRONG>Child Labor</STRONG>: Several commodities in the automotive supply chain are known to be produced with child labor. This includes, for example mica used in metallic car paints which may be mined with child labor in India, cobalt used in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles may be mined with child labor in the Democratic Republic of Congo, or children tapping rubber from trees, working with sharp tools in Indonesia.</LI><LI><STRONG>Forced Labor</STRONG>: Laborers in the automotive supply chain are also at risk of working in conditions of forced labor. For example, the production of charcoal used for pig iron in steel automotive parts and cattle used for leather in automotive seating are both associated with forced labor risks in Brazil. As with child labor, forced labor often occurs due to weak government oversight. Unethical recruitment practices also put workers at risk.</LI><LI><STRONG>Dangerous Working Conditions</STRONG>: Production and manufacturing workers in the automotive supply chain may be engaged in hazardous, labor-intensive work for excessive hours, facing serious health and safety risks without adequate training or protective gear. Barriers to unionization and collective bargaining may also prevent workers from advocating for improved conditions and a living wage.</LI></UL><P>To see commodity specific risks that are informing the engagement, see the resources <SPAN style=""color: #ff0000;""><A href=""#unique-identifier"">below</A></SPAN>.</P><H4>Investor Engagement Calling on Companies to Take Action</H4><P>The goals of this engagement are:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1. Understand how companies are assessing and managing human rights risks in their supply chains,
2. Influence corporate behavior and encourage  the focus companies to develop strong management systems to eliminate the use of forced and child labor in their operations and supply chains,
3. Encourage increased disclosure from these companies on the management of human rights risks to help investors make more informed decisions, and
4. To raise awareness among the investor community about the risks in the automotive sector associated with the vast supply chain and many individual commodities.</P><P>In January 2018, we launched this campaign with a letter from Coalition members to <A href=""#unique-identifier2"">23 companies</A>, including OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), tier 1 suppliers, and a retailer to express our interest and initiate a dialogue.  We recognize these issues are complex and will require sector-wide solutions and collaboration across the industry, along with strong input from impacted workers.  Companies were identified for engagement based on a variety of factors, including existing member holdings, market capitalization, human rights management systems, and known exposure to human rights risks associated with specific commodities.</P><P>The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights state that companies have a responsibility to respect human rights in their own operations as well as in the business relationships where a company has leverage. The UN <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals commit all actors, including the private sector, to take steps to eliminate poverty and achieve sustained, inclusive and <mark>sustainable</mark> economic growth, with decent work for all.  There are also regulatory drivers, such as the UK Modern Slavery Act, calling for more transparency in human rights due diligence, aligned with the OECD Due Diligence Framework.</P><P>We are pleased that nearly all of the automakers and tier 1 suppliers on our focus list have a Human Rights Policy or Statement and a Supplier Code of Conduct, at minimum prohibiting the use of forced and child labor. However, our <A href=""http://tricri.org/wp-content/uploads/Tri-CRI-Auto-Campaign-Commodity-Human-Rights-Risks-Memo.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Research Memo </A>brings together perspectives from various advocacy groups and government sources which make it clear that these policies have not adequately eliminated the use of forced labor or child labor in the extraction of materials and production of inputs.  Therefore, we will largely focus our engagements on encouraging effective implementation of human rights commitments, cascading of expectations to suppliers, meaningful human rights due diligence, increased transparency of raw materials sourcing, and effective governance of these risks, as outlined in our <A href=""http://tricri.org/wp-content/uploads/Tri-CRI-Shifting-Gears-Investor-Briefing.pdf"">Investor Briefing</A>.

A group at Continental are making a dandelion wish of their own, and it’s coming closer to being true. That wish is to one day make tires from rubber that comes from dandelions rather than traditional rubber trees.</P><P>In fact, the wish has already partly been realized. Continental has produced a test tire that has run in both winter and summer conditions within the last year. As part of a joint development called, “RUBIN – Industrial Emergence of Natural Rubber from Dandelion,” Continental, along with the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology, the Julius Kühln Institute and the plant breeding company Aeskulap, Continental aims to be manufacturing consumer road tires made from dandelion-derived rubber within five to ten years.</P><P>Fascinating. But why?</P><P>In fact there are several reasons for why this new technology is being is being developed and if you take a step back and look at the bigger picture, it’s quite genius.</P><P>Leading the call to action is a factor that Continental can’t control, namely, the effects that <mark>climate change</mark> is having on rubber trees. It seems that over the recent past, the fluctuations in the growing cycles of rubber trees in the sub-tropical zone where rubber trees thrive have varied significantly. With these fluctuations the laws of supply and demand take over causing the price of rubber to spike. Eventually, these price spikes will trickle down to increase the price we consumers will pay for tires at retail.</P><P>Continental hopes that by<STRONG><A href=""https://youtu.be/V1_94Uvx15k""> producing tires from dandelion roots </A></STRONG>which are much less sensitive to weather means that supply will be steadier and easier to control leading to greater price stability.</P><P>Since dandelions can be industrially cultivated in Europe a second set of environmental and economic advantages comes into play. Transporting rubber from South America or West Africa to Europe for manufacturing is long and costly journey that also contributes significantly to output of <mark>CO2</mark>. If this part of the process can be consolidated to agricultural zones of Europe where the dandelion can thrive, the economic and <mark>carbon</mark> emissions benefits would be a significant boon to the tire industry.</P><P>“In agricultural terms, dandelions are an undemanding plant, even in the northern hemisphere, and can be cultivated on land not suitable for food production. This means that rubber production is conceivable near our tire factories, for instance, and the significantly shorter transport routes would also reduce <mark>CO2</mark> emissions,” according to Dr. Carla Recker, who heads the Continental team involved in the development of this super material.</P><P>The base rubber produced from the dandelion root is manufactured through the joint commitment of the RUBIN participants into a material called Taraxagum™. The name comes from the botanical name for the dandelion taraxacum. Interestingly the common name of “dandelion” is derived from the French <EM>dent-de-lion, </EM>translating to “tooth of the lion” referring more to the jagged shape of the leaf rather than the wispy flower that we all think of.</P><P>Before you start thinking you can harvest the dandelions on your lawn into a cash crop, think again. Continental isn’t using just any old dandelion but a specific Russian species that is more robust and can be produced in massive quantities effectively.</P><P>The initial tests run so far demonstrate that the tire made from Taraxagum™ show an equivalent, “property profile” when compared to tires made from conventional natural rubber. While the potential is great, there remains some significant ground to be made before the use of this amazing natural material can be fully utilized. For one, there has yet to be found a suitable location in Europe to begin the large scale cultivation of the plant. Nevertheless, the group was recently able to extract several kilos of dandelion rubber from a small pilot system, which would have been double the yield possible from a conventional rubber tree plant under the same circumstances.</P><P>&quot;With this dandelion project, we are taking a huge step forward on the path to our long-term goal of manufacturing tires for cars, trucks and bicycles, as well as specialist tires, completely without any fossil materials,&quot; explains Dr. Boris Mergell, who looks after the cooperation project as the head of Material and Process Development for Tires at Continental.</P><P>Just imagine as you gaze out on your lawn and see the those pesky dandelions popping up that some just like them will soon be the solution for tire future of tire manufacturing. In this case dandelion wishes do come true.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Ford then began replacing more than 10 million Firestone tires free of charge for its own customers, the automaker said.</P><P>Ford Motor Co.'s profits fell 19 percent in second quarter earnings covering April-June 2005, hurt by lower production and harsh competition in North America, where it lost more than $900 million.</P><P>David Healy, an auto industry analyst with New York-based Burnham Securities Inc., said the settlement should have little effect on the company's long-term financial picture.</P><P>&quot;It's footnote,&quot; Healy said. &quot;I think it's a minor help to Ford's cash position. I suppose anytime you get about a quarter of a billion dollars it's welcome, but it doesn't change the big picture.&quot;</P><P>In July 2003 Bridgestone announced a settlement of a class action lawsuit involving Firestone tires that were part of the company's August 2000 recall. The agreement resolved a number of class action lawsuits filed against Bridgestone involving customers who did not suffer personal injury or property damage, company officials said.</P><P>Some lawsuits against Ford and Bridgestone are still pending, though officials at both companies were unable to specify the exact number.</P><P>Tab Turner, a Little Rock, Ark.-based lawyer who has assisted in a class-action lawsuit and represented about 250 individual plaintiffs in suits against the companies, said about a dozen class-action lawsuits and between 1,000-1,500 individual cases have been filed related to the tires or Ford vehicles or both since the 2000 recall.</P><P>About 50 individual cases nationwide are still pending, Turner said.</P><P>&quot;Those lawsuits have largely disappeared,&quot; Turner said. &quot;This settlement will not have any impact on the individual lawsuits. This is just a pure business dispute between the manufacturers of the vehicle and one of its suppliers.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""copyright"">© 2005 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
