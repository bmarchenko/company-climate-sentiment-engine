Increased competition for “ever-diminishing food and water resources” will amplify socio-economically motivated armed conflicts, countries’ difficulties controlling their borders, and instability more generally, he said.</P><P>“I think <mark>climate change</mark> is going to be an underpinning for a lot of national security issues,” Clapper said. It affects “so many things: the availability of basics like water and food and other resources which are continually going to become matters of conflict, and already are, between and among countries.”</P><P>The Pentagon has been getting increasingly serious about preparing for it, warning that <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/20/sunday-review/<mark>climate</mark>-change-hot-future.html?_r=0"">warming</A><A href=""https://www.theatlas.com/charts/N18G8axZx"">global temperatures</A> and extreme weather events would act as a “threat multiplier” and <A href=""http://www.newsweek.com/pentagon-report-us-military-considers-<mark>climate</mark>-change-immediate-threat-could-277155"">foster terrorism</A>. Earlier this year, Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work ordered the military to <A href=""https://<mark>climate</mark>andsecurity.org/2016/01/20/new-dept-of-defense-directive-on-<mark>climate</mark>-security/"">adapt current and future operations to address <mark>climate change</mark></A>.</P><DIV class=""d1-article-left-rail-subscribe-container""><P class=""d1-article-sidebar-subscribe-title""><SPAN class=""d1-article-sidebar-subscribe-title-text"">Subscribe</SPAN></P><P class=""d1-article-sidebar-subscribe-msg"">Subscribe to the Defense One daily.</P><P class=""d1-article-sidebar-subscribe-msg"">Be the first to receive updates.</P></DIV><P>Clapper echoed this warning. <mark>Climate change</mark>-driven instability and other factors mean that “after <SPAN class=""caps"">ISIL</SPAN> is gone, you can expect some other terrorist entity to arise, and the cycle of extremism [to] continue for the foreseeable future.”</P><H3 class=""wysiwyg"">Also read: <A href=""http://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2014/05/debate-goes-military-prepares-<mark>climate</mark>-change/83968/"">As Debate Goes On, the Military Prepares for <mark>Climate</mark> Change</A></H3><P>Americans as a whole are increasingly concerned about global warming as well, according to Gallup polls. The share of the population worried a fair amount or great deal about <mark>climate change</mark> more broadly <A href=""https://www.theatlas.com/charts/VyU9OaOax"">increased from 2015 to 2016</A>, regardless of the individual’s political affiliation.</P><P>The House of Representatives, however, would rather the military concentrate solely on what Rep. John Fleming, R-La., <A href=""http://fleming.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=394859"">called</A> “real, credible threats,” like the Islamic State, Russia and Iran. For the third year in a row, its version of the National Defense Authorization Act included an amendment, passed largely along party lines, that <A href=""http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-07-24/gop-leading-effort-block-military-planning-<mark>climate</mark>-change?"">prohibited using funds</A> to implement executive orders directing the military to plan for <mark>climate</mark> change.</P><P>“These executive orders require the Department of Defense to squander—squander—precious defense dollars by incorporating <mark>climate change</mark> bureaucracies into its acquisition and military operations and to waste money on green energy projects,” Fleming said in a floor speech proposing the amendment.</P><P>That, and <A href=""http://dailysignal.com/2016/04/26/12-amendments-to-watch-for-in-defense-authorization-fight/"">other battles over the <SPAN class=""caps"">NDAA</SPAN></A>, will have to be hashed out in conference between the House and Senate, but not anytime soon: three to six months, depending on how the <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/09/06/congress-returns-with-one-goal-no-government-shutdown/"">continuing resolution fight</A> shakes out.</P></DIV><UL class=""d1-article-author-bio""><LI class=""d1-article-author-bio-item""><SPAN class=""d1-article-author-bio-item-text"">

A number of active coastal military installations in the continental UnitedStates are at a significant and increasing risk of damage, as a function of flooding from worsened storm surges in the near-term. In addition, two dozen nuclear facilities and numerous refineries along US coastlines are at risk and may be severely impacted by storms. *</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""paywall"">And while the United States copes with all of that, the country &quot;will need to anticipate and plan for growing immigration pressures. Although sea level rise is probably a slow and long-term development, extreme weather events and growing evidence of inundation will motivate many to move sooner rather than later.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">Fingar warned, however, that the cure for global warming might be worse than the proverbial disease. &quot;Government, business, and public efforts to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies to deal with <mark>climate change</mark> — from policies to reduce greenhouse gasses to plans to reduce exposure to <mark>climate change</mark> or capitalize on potential impacts —may affect US national security interests even more than the physical impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> itself,&quot; he said.</P><P class=""paywall"">Those sentiments were echoed by Marlo Lewis, with the <A href=""http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Competitive_Enterprise_Institute#Funding"" target=""_blank"">energy industry-funded</A><A href=""http://www.cei.org/"" target=""_blank"">Competitive Enterprise Institute</A>. &quot;<A href=""/images_blogs/dangerroom/files/statement_of_marlo_lewis__1_.pdf"">There are also risks associated with global warming policy</A>,&quot; Lewis said.

The Chinese and American economies both get essential resources from the Middle East and Africa, the two regions likely to feel the greatest effects of global warming. So China and the U.S. &quot;share a common interest in maintaining stability and ensuring dependable access at reasonable prices.&quot;</P><P class=""paywall"">But Butts also warned that <mark>climate change</mark> could make those regions more fertile ground for terrorists.</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""paywall""><P>*Many countries that face a terrorist threat suggest that the UnitedStates must place more emphasis on winning the ideological struggle if it is to succeed in the struggle against terror. State political systems unable to meet the demands placed upon them by the population struggle to maintain legitimacy and power, and invite the introduction of alternative or extremist ideology. Global <mark>climate change</mark> places additional demands upon the political system that many developing states cannot meet. Scarcities of resources, lack of safe water, reduced agricultural capacity; widespread disease and poverty create underlying conditions that terrorists seek to exploit. According to the World Bank, intrastate conflict is 15 times more likely to occur in poor countries than in the industrialized countries. Food riots in Cairo at a time when members of the Muslim Brotherhood are running for election demonstrate the problem. *</P><P><EM><mark>Climate change</mark> fans the fires of regional instability and creates opportunities for terrorists.

By 2050, <mark>Intel</mark> and Strategy Analytics made the astounding prediction that the passenger economy will have a $7 trillion economic impact.</P><P>The companies estimated that the passenger economy (services to fill the idle time while you ride in a car) would be more than twice the size of the <A href=""https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/04/the-sharing-economy-has-created-17-billion-dollar-companies-and-10-unicorns/"">sharing economy</A> (based on companies such as Uber or Lyft that share resources across many people) by 2050.</P><P>I have to remark how easy it is to ridicule this research. Economists have a hard enough time predicting economic change on a monthly basis. <mark>Intel</mark> paid Strategy Analytics to look at the economy 33 years from now, and it came up with a figure for the passenger economy being worth $7 trillion in 2050. Despite my light-hearted skepticism, <mark>Intel</mark> and the researchers are dead serious about the huge impact that self-driving will have.</P><DIV id=""attachment_2232743"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""max-width:800px;""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Above: <mark>Intel</mark> believes 5G wireless will bring lots of services to cars of the future.</P><DIV class=""vb_image_source""><EM>Image Credit: <mark>Intel</mark></EM></DIV></DIV><P>Qualcomm recently looked into the same thing, starting with some very different assumptions. <A href=""https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/5g/economy"">Qualcomm paid for a research paper</A> created by David Teece, professor at the University of California at Berkeley, and market researcher IHS Markit to assess the impact of 5G mobile technology — which Qualcomm is playing a big hand in bringing about — on the economy. That report said 5G would create 22 million jobs and $12.3 trillion in impact on goods and services by 2035.</P><P>These predictions are surely going to be wildly off the mark, but I won’t be around to check — unless of course there are some real breakthroughs in biotechnology that will keep my brain intact. My prediction is that, thanks to Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the <mark>climate change</mark> accord, that the headquarters of both <mark>Intel</mark> and Qualcomm will be underwater by 2050.</P><P>That said, I find the discussion that these reports trigger to be very interesting. When I think back to debates about the mobile Internet, I recall a lot of fears that Europe and Japan were going to jump ahead of the U.S. because they set aside the proper amount of bandwidth early for it. And in fact, these fears came to pass. Europe and Asia <EM>are</EM> far ahead in some respects, with faster wireless broadband and better services on top of those networks. Indeed, maybe companies such as WeChat, Kakao, Supercell, and NCSoft would be based in the U.S. if policy makers had moved faster and planted the seeds for a mobile economy.</P><P>Qualcomm’s study found that 91 percent of those surveyed expect 5G to create new products and services that have yet to be invented.</P><P>The report assumes that it may take something like a decade for autonomous cars to become mainstream and make a real impact on society. By 2035, the passenger economy will only be about $800 billion. The real growth comes from 2035 to 2050, which is about the same time period when we’ll need to have flying or floating cars because of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><DIV id=""attachment_1792221"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""max-width:800px;""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Above: <mark>Intel</mark> and self-driving cars.</P><DIV class=""vb_image_source""><EM>Image Credit: <mark>Intel</mark></EM></DIV></DIV><P>Greg Lindsay, urbanist, mobility futurist, and coauthor of <A href=""http://www.aerotropolis.com/airportCities/aerotropolis-the-way-well-live-next""><EM>Aerotropolis: The Way We’ll Live Next</EM></A>, said in a press call about the <mark>Intel</mark> report that the $7 trillion figure might be really conservative because self-driving cars could be the biggest change in transportation since the creation of the “horseless carriage.”</P><P>The idea of “mobility as a service” will disrupt long-held patterns of car ownership, maintenance, operations, and usage. Indeed, if I’m not going to drive my car, maybe I don’t need to own it. And if I don’t own it, I won’t take it to Jiffy Lube, and Jiffy Lube will have to serve some giant self-driving car rental agency instead. Mobility as a service is expected to be a $3 trillion industry by 2050, or 43 percent of the total passenger economy.</P><DIV id=""attachment_2236646"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""max-width:581px;""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Above: The breakdown of a $7 trillion passenger economy by 2050.</P><DIV class=""vb_image_source""><EM>Image Credit: <mark>Intel</mark></EM></DIV></DIV><P>Consumer use of mobility as a service is expected to be about $3.7 trillion of the passenger economy, or 55 percent of the total. And another $200 billion is expected to come from consumer use of innovative applications and services. From 2035 to 2045, the report estimates 585,000 lives can be saved due to self-driving cars. Collectively, autonomous cars could save us more than 250 million hours of commuting time a year. Reductions in public safety costs could amount to more than $234 billion of the passenger economy from 2035 to 2045. Hmm. Maybe that means there won’t be so many highway patrol jobs?</P><P>On the other hand, Lindsay said that if it is no longer such a chore to drive, people might not mind traveling to work over a longer period of time, like maybe two hours, because being a passenger isn’t so taxing as driving. <mark>Intel</mark> envisions onboard beauty salons, touchscreen tablets for remote collaboration, fast-casual dining, remote vending, mobile health care clinics, and treatment pods. And who needs to use valuable real estate to park cars anymore? In fact, it might make a lot of sense for an apartment landlord to offer an autonomous car service as a part of the rent for an apartment.</P><DIV id=""attachment_2232749"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""max-width:800px;""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Above: An artist’s illustration was part of the “When Cars Can Talk: Readying the Network for 5G and the Autonomous Driving Era” presentation at <mark>Intel</mark>’s one-day autonomous driving workshop.</P><DIV class=""vb_image_source""><EM>Image Credit: <mark>Intel</mark></EM></DIV></DIV><P>Roger Lanctot, director of automotive connected mobility at Strategy Analytics and a coauthor of the report, said that we could actually cram more vehicles onto the road because they will be so good at avoiding collisions. That could help us deal with all of the trucks that Amazon puts on the road because it has wiped out stores. And I’m sure that advertisers will find ways to blast us with location-based advertising.</P><P>Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of <mark>Intel</mark>’s automated driving solutions division, said in a call that <mark>Intel</mark> thinks the history of technology is worth remembering here. We’ve seen massive societal transformations as digital business models were ushered in by personal computing, the Internet, ubiquitous connectivity, and smartphones. She believes autonomous driving will do the same. It’s like looking back at the space race and seeing the unpredictable things — like the semiconductor chips that <mark>Intel</mark> itself makes — that came from it, Lindsay said.</P><P>“We started thinking about other evolving economies,” Winter said. “Why do we care about this passenger economy? As more of us understand the future, the more we can plan and adapt. This massive new economy is driving big changes in the way we do things.”</P><P>In short, I find it fascinating to think about the changes that will come in society as technology advances. But I still have a hard time thinking about these reports as scientific. By the way, I asked if that $7 trillion estimate had a big margin of error.</P><P>“Based on studies looking on similar market sizings like the adoption of 5G, many come out in a similar vicinity,” said Lanctot said. “There is enough to suggest an acceptable margin of error.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

He tweeted: &quot;departing presidential councils,&quot; a reference to advisory groups he has participated in, including the so-called President's Strategic and Policy Forum.</P><P>Trump has had a complicated relationship with the tech industry, which largely lined up behind Democrat Hillary Clinton during the presidential election. After his victory, the industry hesitantly approached Trump, who has been eager to seek its counsel — including via a high-profile gathering of tech leaders at Trump Tower during his presidential transition. </P><P>But he has since clashed with the liberal-leaning industry on issues like immigration and transgender rights. And Trump has been <A href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/donald-trump-tech-targets-220288"" target=""_blank"">harshly critical</A> at times of what he sees as the failings of some of the industry's biggest companies and their leaders.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

But in an administration where top officials, including some with <mark>intel</mark>ligence responsibilities, have <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topics/denial"">repeatedly questioned</A> the basic science of global warming, such a frank confirmation of the mainstream consensus was striking.</P><P>The <mark>intel</mark>ligence agencies' <A href=""https://www.<mark>intel</mark>ligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-dcoats-021318.PDF"">Worldwide Threat Assessment</A> contrasted with two other recent documents issued by the Trump administration: the <A href=""https://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf"">National Defense Strategy</A> published in January and the <A href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf"">National Security Strategy</A> published in December. Both of those broke from the pattern of recent years and omitted <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/<mark>climate</mark>-change""><mark>climate change</mark></A> as a significant concern.</P><P>The <mark>intel</mark>ligence community, instead, aligned itself with science agencies.

Ireland is the first major <mark>Intel</mark> location outside of the U.S. to have bought 100% certifiable renewable electricity. Simultaneously, <mark>Intel</mark> has greened its energy supply in over a dozen major European facilities to 100%.</P><P>Speaking about the renewable energy purchase, <mark>Intel</mark> Ireland General Manager Eamonn Sinnott said; “We are very proud to be announcing today that 100% of all electricity supplied to our Leixlip campus is now purchased as renewable power from Electric Ireland. We are doing this as part of our multi-faceted approach to environmental awareness and as part of <mark>Intel</mark>’s commitment to being a global energy sustainability champion”.</P><P>“We hope that our decision to go green will help to further stimulate the renewable energy market and encourage other businesses to follow suit. The more participation in the green power market and the more additional capacity that can come on stream will ultimately further help the environment and help to lower costs”.</P><P>Electric Ireland is the retail arm of ESB, and ESB Chief Executive Pat O’Doherty was on hand today to welcome the announcement. “It is a genuine pleasure for ESB and Electric Ireland to partner with <mark>Intel</mark> – one of the world’s leading companies – so that it can run its Leixlip plants entirely on renewable electricity. When ESB was founded 90 years ago, 100% of the energy we generated was renewable, harnessed from the River Shannon. As we face into the energy challenges of the coming decades, this provides us with inspiration to play a leading role in Ireland’s transition to a low <mark>carbon</mark> future. The Electric Ireland agreement with <mark>Intel</mark> is an example of how we seek to place our customer at the centre of this low <mark>carbon</mark> future, powered by clean, reliable and affordable electricity”.</P><P>Based on Electric Ireland data, <mark>Intel</mark> is the largest, voluntary, private purchaser of indigenous renewable energy in Ireland. <mark>Intel</mark> is also the largest voluntary green power purchaser in the United States for the past nine years, according to EPA data from the United States.</P><DIV class=""soliloquy-outer-container"" data-soliloquy-loaded=""1""><DIV id=""soliloquy-container-4472"" class=""soliloquy-container soliloquy-transition-fade soliloquy-fade soliloquy-controls-active soliloquy-arrows-active soliloquy-theme-base"" aria-live=""polite""><DIV class=""soliloquy-wrapper""><DIV class=""soliloquy-viewport""><DIV class=""soliloquy-caption soliloquy-caption-bottom""><DIV class=""soliloquy-caption-inside""><STRONG>Pictured above at the <mark>Intel</mark> campus are <mark>Intel</mark> Ireland General Manager Eamonn Sinnott and ESB Chief Executive Pat O’Doherty.</STRONG></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P><STRONG>Green Energy purchase and Guarantees of Origin</STRONG>
From 2016, <mark>Intel</mark> Ireland has contracted to buy all its power and green attributes from its key supplier, Electric Ireland. <mark>Intel</mark> Ireland is now supplied with 100% indigenous renewable electricity supported by Irish in-country Guarantees of Origin (GoOs).</P><P>Guarantees of Origin are electronic certificates issued for energy generated from renewable sources. They ensure that the green attributes produced by a renewable source are actually generated, tracked, transferred to a single owner and then retired so they cannot be re-transferred which helps to stimulate the need for future renewable generation. Every GoO kWh is tracked and accounted for from its generation source. This mechanism is globally accepted in many forms or names but all serve the same purpose and generally similar rules.</P><P>The cost for green power is currently higher than the standard grid supply. <mark>Intel</mark> is supporting the purchase of the green power in order to continue to drive adoption and increased supply and to raise awareness of the issue. As the supply increases and technologies advance, <mark>Intel</mark> believes that renewables will be even more competitive and compelling than they are today.  This latest initiative is one of many actions by <mark>Intel</mark> to support energy sustainability and by doing so the company hopes to drive reinvestment and <mark>innovation</mark> which is vital for the continued drive towards a diverse, <mark>sustainable</mark> and strong energy supply.</P><P><mark>Intel</mark> in Ireland is proud to be leaders in establishing the mechanism and philosophies to buy, through a regulated process, green energy with traceable attributes. <mark>Intel</mark> is committed to this philosophy now and for the future.<STRONG>
<mark>Intel</mark> Ireland’s Environmental leadership</STRONG>
<mark>Intel</mark> Ireland is committed to being a leader in environmental sustainability and has demonstrated this commitment to the environment since first establishing operations here in 1989. <mark>Intel</mark> Ireland is at the forefront of <mark>sustainable</mark> plant operations across <mark>Intel</mark> worldwide, voluntarily investing more than €35 million in energy conservation projects at the Leixlip site in recent years.</P><P>Reduction activities over the last four years alone have resulted in over 46,000 tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> saved, equivalent to over 12,000 cars taken oﬀ the road. In 2015 <mark>Intel</mark> Ireland achieved a saving of 18,000,000 kWh through the implementation of projects such as heat recovery in the manufacturing area, data centre free cooling and conversion of pumps from fixed to variable speed drive. The Leixlip factory cleanroom heating systems are now is 30% more energy efficient.</P><P><mark>Intel</mark> Ireland also supports a number of pilot projects to drive sustainability at its Leixlip campus, the most recent of which saw the first hybrid lighting poles installed which utilise solar panels and a wind turbine on each lighting unit to provide a fully <mark>sustainable</mark> and low maintenance lighting solution in the carpark area.</P><P>In the last 4 years, <mark>Intel</mark> Ireland has recycled 92% of solid waste and are close to achieving a zero chemical waste to landfill goal with 99% of all chemical waste going to non-landfill sources.</P><P><mark>Intel</mark> Ireland is also committed to collecting input from local communities about environmental performance. Over the past number of years, <mark>Intel</mark> has supported major projects to improve a local amenity, the Rye Water, working to preserve and enhance its natural habitat. Since first establishing operations at the Leixlip campus <mark>Intel</mark> has been aware of the rich biodiversity and the significance of the Rye Water and its Valley.</P><P>In 2015 <mark>Intel</mark> launched the Pride of Place Competition which is aimed at supporting environmental initiatives that positively impact the neighbouring communities in North Kildare. The competition has since involved partnerships with the Tidy Towns Associations of Leixlip, Celbridge and Maynooth. Each was invited to submit three proposals for <mark>sustainable</mark> initiatives that would enhance the environment of their local community while also engaging people in the community on environmental matters.</P><P>Earlier this year <mark>Intel</mark> launched a new biodiversity report which proudly marked the achievement of becoming the first company in Ireland to use Business in the Community Ireland’s innovative Biodiversity Framework to shape its approach to biodiversity management.<STRONG>
<mark>Intel</mark>’s Global Commitment to addressing <mark>Climate Change</mark></STRONG>
<mark>Intel</mark> Corporation has been engaged in actions and strategies for decades that reduce its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint and began to publicly report on greenhouse gas emissions many years ago. <mark>Intel</mark> has developed dedicated teams and actions to make significant investments in energy conservation, over $145 million since 2008, resulting in savings of 3.19 billion kWh which reduces its greenhouse gas emissions. The company have installed over 60 alternative energy supply projects including facilitating the construction of 40 on-site solar electric installations at <mark>Intel</mark> locations around the world.</P><P>Since 2008, <mark>Intel</mark> continues to be the largest voluntary purchaser of green power in the U.S., according to the U.S. EPA’s Green Power Partnership rankings. <mark>Intel</mark> purchased 3.4 billion kWh of green power in 2015, enough to meet 100% of its annual U.S. electricity use. In October 2015 <mark>Intel</mark> joined the White House <mark>Climate</mark> Pledge, a reflection of the company’s ongoing commitment to addressing <mark>climate change</mark>.</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

If we can, that's great. If we can't, that's fine.&quot;</P><P>In response, one CEO after another tweeted disappointment at the announcement, companies issued statements committing to action on <mark>climate change</mark> and one high-profile member of Trump's business advisory council said he would leave the forum in response, after earlier threatening on Twitter to do just that. &quot;Am departing presidential councils,&quot; tweeted Tesla and SpaceX CEO <A id=""PEBSL000988"" title=""Elon Musk"" href=""/topic/business/elon-musk-PEBSL000988-topic.html"">Elon Musk</A> on Thursday afternoon. &quot;<mark>Climate change</mark> is real.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said on Twitter he was &quot;deeply disappointed&quot; by Trump's decision and &quot;will double our efforts to fight <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; while <A id=""ORCRP009947"" title=""Microsoft"" href=""/topic/business/technology-industry/microsoft-ORCRP009947-topic.html"">Microsoft</A>'s Brad Smith said in a statement that &quot;we believe that <mark>climate change</mark> is an urgent issue that demands global action.&quot;</P><P>Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris, who was the driving force behind a letter signed by 30 high-profile CEOs earlier this month encouraging Trump to honor the U.S. commitment, said that his company would &quot;continue to collaborate with President Trump as well as other businesses, NGOs and academics&quot; on greenhouse gas reductions. In a statement following Trump's announcement, <mark>Intel</mark> said it &quot;firmly&quot; believes the United States should keep participating in <A id=""EVGAP00096"" title=""Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Accord"" href=""/topic/environmental-issues/paris-<mark>climate</mark>-accord-EVGAP00096-topic.html"">the accord</A>. &quot;Withdrawal won't change our investment in renewable energy, and we will continue to advocate for the U.S. to engage.&quot;</P><P>The response follows months of letters and outreach to Trump from companies in industries as diverse as manufacturing, technology and energy to remain part of the 195-nation accord, making arguments that went well beyond sustainability, good corporate citizenship or the need for American leadership. While Trump's explanation for exiting the accord was, in part, that it would hurt domestic manufacturing and cost U.S. jobs, CEOs' appeals to the president have been largely business-focused, saying rather that an exit threatens American competitiveness, raises the risk of negative trade implications and could hurt their ability to create jobs.</P><P>Leading up to the announcement, several CEOs made final arguments to Trump or issued pleas for staying in the deal. Bloomberg reported that on Tuesday Apple CEO <A id=""PEBSL000519"" title=""Tim Cook"" href=""/topic/business/technology-industry/tim-cook-PEBSL000519-topic.html"">Tim Cook</A> placed a call to the White House to urge the president to stay in. The same day, Musk tweeted an open threat to Trump, saying he would lose him on the business advisory councils if Trump exited the accord. &quot;I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH &amp; via councils, that we remain,&quot; Musk wrote.</P><P>When a follower asked him what he would do if Trump makes the call to exit, Musk said he would have &quot;no choice&quot; but to leave the White House councils of which he is a member.</P><P>The final push by CEOs also included letters that were featured in full-page ads in newspapers, such as one signed by 25 companies that ran in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal on Thursday and earlier in May. The ads were sponsored by the Center for <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy Solutions and the sustainability nonprofit Ceres and included a shorter version of a letter that was first signed in April, arguing that &quot;the United States can best exercise global leadership and advance U.S. interests by remaining a full partner in this vital global effort.&quot; Google, <mark>Intel</mark>, Unilever and Schneider Electric were just a few of the names that signed the letter.</P><P>Even ExxonMobil had appealed to Trump to stay in the agreement. In a letter dated May 9, CEO Darren Woods wrote to Trump in what the Financial Times called a &quot;last-ditch personal plea,&quot; arguing that staying in allows the United States to remain &quot;at the negotiating table to ensure a level playing field&quot; on energy sources. That letter followed a prior appeal by the fossil fuels giant, which remains under fire from shareholders over <mark>climate</mark> issues, to the White House in March.</P><P>Besides Musk, a few other members of Trump's advisory council had signed letters opposing withdrawal from the agreement. The May letter spearheaded by Liveris urging Trump to stay in the agreement was also signed by <A id=""ORCRP010217"" title=""JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co."" href=""/topic/business/financial-business-services/jpmorgan-chase-%26-co.-ORCRP010217-topic.html"">JPMorgan Chase</A> CEO Jamie Dimon and Iger, both of whom Trump named to his business advisory council.</P></DIV><DIV class=""trb_ar_page"" data-role=""pagination_page"" data-content-page=""2""><P>Efforts by Corporate America to influence Trump on the agreement go back at least to shortly after the election, when hundreds of large and small companies, ranging from Starbucks to Monsanto, signed a letter in support of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement. &quot;Failure to build a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy puts American prosperity at risk,&quot; the letter said, calling the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement a &quot;historic opportunity to tackle <mark>climate change</mark>.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Start-up firm Jupiter aims to come to the rescue.</A>] </I></P><P>“Columbia is the first of many planned collaborations between Jupiter and academic institutions at the vanguard of understanding <mark>climate change</mark> science and its impacts,” said Rich Sorkin, CEO of Jupiter. “Collaboration between these partners and our staff … will foster productivity and <mark>innovation</mark>. Perhaps most importantly, we are accelerating the practical adoption of research.”</P><P>Sorkin designed Jupiter’s community science program to identify and fund science that is close to ready for commercial application and can be integrated into its cloud-based computing framework, on which its <mark>climate</mark> simulations operate.</P><P>Sorkin said research that might take 10 to 20 years to be applied in government could be put to use in as little as six months at his company. “We have a strong interest in seeing the best available science and technology reach maturity as soon as possible,” he said.</P><P>The partnership is win-win-win for research, business and society, says Columbia’s dean of science, <A href=""http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~peter/site/Home.html"">Peter de Menocal</A>. “It’s a new science-delivery model,” he said in an interview. “We win by supporting scientists and making markets and society more resilient to <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>De Menocal, who founded Columbia’s <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>andlife.columbia.edu/"">Center for <mark>Climate</mark> and Life</A>, said the business community is increasingly taking note of the economic consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> and it is more urgent than ever for scientists and corporate leaders to work together. “The private sector and the investment community is where the rubber meets the road in terms of acting on what we know,” he said. “What’s needed is engaging the private sector to transfer knowledge to action.”</P><P>Jupiter is initially offering $300,000 for a project to advance Columbia’s Hurricane Interactive Track Simulator (HITS). The model projects coastal flooding from landfalling storms and incorporates effects from severe wind and rain.</P><P>The simulator “is addressing several important factors in an integrated way that are computationally efficient and well-suited for our cloud-based [computing] infrastructure,” Sorkin said. “The social benefit of that is that we’re contributing to acceleration of raw knowledge to practical impact from basic/advanced research to applications. We can go probably one to three years faster with a collaboration with a first-year partner at Lamont-Doherty than if we’re just doing this on our own.”</P><P>Sorkin said Jupiter will fund at least two additional projects, to be announced soon, at Columbia  relating to the coastal effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>But can a for-profit company such as Jupiter pay an institution like Columbia to conduct work without trying to commandeer how it proceeds, potentially tainting the academic independence of the results?</P><P>Sorkin said his company will not interfere. “We are confident enough, in totality, of what we’re doing as a company that we don’t need to control any particular component,” he said.</P><P>De Menocal expressed no concern about working with a partner that has a financial stake in its findings. “You don’t want to pollute the discovery process, and to [Sorkin’s] credit, he understands, respects and enforces that,” he said. “The science is going to unfold how it’s going to unfold. Then it’s up to [Sorkin] to see if there’s a market for that knowledge.”</P><P>In all, Jupiter said it will invest more than $1 million at Columbia, including contributions from a network of philanthropic partners that it is cultivating. “Many of [Sorkin’s] investors are private individuals who have philanthropic foundations,” de Menocal said. “He’s made it clear to those investors he’d be very happy if they invested in science.”</P><P>“We think by a taking leadership position we can catalyze philanthropic community to do much more,” Sorkin said. “We have commitment as a company to public, private and academic collaboration. That commitment is core to the culture of our company.”</P><P>Jupiter also announced Monday it has formed a relationship with the University of Southern California. “Jupiter’s founders and investors are supporting a new philanthropic program at USC intended to foster interdisciplinary work in the area of natural perils and risk,” the company said in a news release.</P><P>Both Sorkin and Columbia’s de Menocal emphasized their collaboration helps fill the gap between available federal dollars and what is necessary for <mark>climate</mark> and weather research to thrive.</P><P>“There’s always an unlimited amount of demands on federal budget,” Sorkin said. “This administration and others have decreased funding in areas of weather, <mark>climate</mark>, hydrology and related disciplines that affect health and safety issues and can have economic disruptions.”</P><P>For <mark>climate</mark> researchers, the declining budgets have meant tough times. Dollars are few, and the competition is fierce.

The <EM>Times</EM> notes that Trump fears it'll harm the economy, hurt job creation in areas where many of his supporters live and damage his &quot;American first&quot; message. Given the success of the many companies who signed today's letter, there's clearly an economic argument to be had for staying in the Paris Agreement -- if Trump is willing to listen.</P><P><EM><STRONG>Correction:</STRONG> This article originally stated that the open letter was published on June 1st when it was published earlier in May.

Northstar Asset Management hold near 80,000 shares, totaling around $4 million of <mark>Intel</mark> stock, and is looking for answers from the chip giant.</P><P dir=""ltr""><mark>Intel</mark> held its 2018 annual shareholders meeting last week, in which three proposals were voted on by a grand total of 4.7 billion outstanding shares. One of these proposals recommends <mark>Intel</mark> justifies its political spending, which some shareholders believe don’t match up with <mark>Intel</mark>’s company values regarding diversity, <mark>climate change</mark>, and discrimination.</P><P dir=""ltr""><EM>Don’t get lost in the codenames. Here are the <A title=""best CPUs for gaming"" href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-cpu-for-gaming"" target=""_blank"">best CPUs for gaming</A> in 2018.</EM></P><P dir=""ltr""><mark>Intel</mark> has a reputation for being vocal advocates for diversity, even dedicating a large sum of money - $300 million, to be precise - towards this mission back in 2015. Since that time, underrepresented minority employees in leadership positions has increased by 27%, and <mark>Intel</mark> has moved its goal for full representation within the company by 2020 to instead reach this milestone by 2018.</P></DIV><P dir=""ltr"">While there’s always more to be done to benefit inclusionary policies and equality - <mark>Intel</mark>’s US workforce is still <A href=""https://www.<mark>intel</mark>.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/diversity/diversity-inclusion-annual-report.html"" target=""_blank"">overwhelmingly made up of men from non-underrepresented backgrounds</A> - <mark>Intel</mark>’s stats indicate a trend towards greater diversity and inclusion.</P><P dir=""ltr""><mark>Intel</mark> contributes internally to diversity programs <A href=""https://newsroom.<mark>intel</mark>.com/editorials/2017-diversity-inclusion-annual-report-approaching-first-leg-<mark>intel</mark>s-journey/?_ga=2.90602008.389274514.1526636912-1433481098.1525770455"" target=""_blank"">spearheaded by chief diversity and inclusion officer, Barbara Whye</A>. But it also make efforts outside of the company through initiatives such as the supplier diversity investment program, which aims to spend $1 billion by 2020 with suppliers that support <mark>Intel</mark>’s goals in diversity, sustainability, and education, as well as provide internships for underrepresented minorities.</P><P dir=""ltr"">For some shareholders, however, this corporate ethos of inclusion and diversity doesn’t quite match up with donations to politicians made by the <mark>Intel</mark> Political Action Committee, or IPAC for short.</P><P dir=""ltr"">IPAC was created back in the ‘80s to fund candidates for public office “whose legislative goals align with <mark>Intel</mark>’s public policy priorities” as outlined by <A href=""https://www.<mark>intel</mark>.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/corporate-information/policy-political-accountability.pdf"" target=""_blank""><mark>Intel</mark>’s accountability document</A>. This committee utilises voluntary donations from <mark>Intel</mark>’s employees and directors to fund various political groups and <A href=""https://www.bipac.net/page.asp?content=voting_records&amp;g=IPAC"" target=""_blank"">support key policy issues</A>. For the record, corporate funds from <mark>Intel</mark> are strictly forbidden.</P><P dir=""ltr"">For example, according to <A href=""https://iiwisdom.com/intc-2018/stockholder-proposals/"" target=""_blank"">proposal six outlined at <mark>Intel</mark>’s stockholders’ meeting</A>, IPAC contributions from 2015 to 2017 include 15 members of US Congress that voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which prevents discrimination in hiring based on gender identity or sexual orientation. Other contributions, outlined by NorthStar, include 20 members of US Congress that voted against an amendment to the Justice for Victims of Trafficking act, and 51 members of US Congress that have been identified as <mark>climate change</mark> deniers.</P><P dir=""ltr"">That includes senator Ted Cruz, who has received $3,150 in total from IPAC since 2012. You know the guy, he ran for the presidential ticket for the GOP, and <A href=""https://www.npr.org/2015/12/09/459026242/scientific-evidence-doesn-t-support-global-warming-sen-ted-cruz-says"" target=""_blank"">once said</A> global warming was simply “liberal politicians who want government power over the economy, the energy sector, and every aspect of our lives.”</P><P dir=""ltr"">Something doesn’t add up. <mark>Intel</mark> vocally supports the US reentry into the Paris <mark>Climate Change</mark> Agreement,<A href=""https://www.<mark>intel</mark>.com/content/www/us/en/corporate-responsibility/environment-<mark>climate</mark>-change-policy.html"" target=""_blank""> as-per-policy</A> and its <A href=""http://csrreportbuilder.<mark>intel</mark>.com/PDFfiles/CSR-2017_Full-Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">corporate responsibility report</A> tells largely the same story. This same company policy directly outlines the threats of <mark>climate change</mark>, yet <mark>Intel</mark>’s PAC donations have been actively funding some politicians identified as refusing to acknowledge its existence. However, NorthStar Asset Management wants to open these political donations to discussion.</P><P dir=""ltr"">NorthStar Assets Management is a “socially-responsible” investment firm based in Boston, who focus on shareholder engagement, targeted giving, and challenging income equality and the wealth gap. It also holds 79,040 stocks in <mark>Intel</mark>, which equates to over $4 million in value. That puts the company in a rather interesting position as advocates for change, yet also with a substantial vested interest in the continued success of <mark>Intel</mark>.</P><P dir=""ltr"">Despite its shared financial interests, NorthStar doesn’t pull any punches when it comes to its shareholder activism and upholding its beliefs. The firm put forward <A href=""https://seekingalpha.com/article/4175263-<mark>intel</mark>-corporations-intc-ceo-brian-krzanich-hosts-2018-stockholders-meeting-transcript?part=single"" target=""_blank"">proposal six at the shareholders’ meeting</A>, which aimed to incite a vote on a cost-benefit analysis report into <mark>Intel</mark>’s PAC contributions. The firm tried a similar resolution back in 2017, and has been involved with <mark>Intel</mark> regarding its political contributions since 2012.</P><P dir=""ltr"">“Given the recent controversies regarding misconduct of politicians and around electioneering contributions in general,” the proposal says, “as well as the apparent misalignment between many <mark>Intel</mark>-directed political contributions and company values and policies, shareholders are concerned that benefit to the company of influencing policymakers through <mark>Intel</mark>-directed political contributions may not outweigh the risks associated with these contributions.</P><P dir=""ltr"">“Shareholders recommend that the Board of Directors report to shareholders (at reasonable expense, excluding confidential information) a cost-benefit analysis of the most recent election cycle’s political and electioneering contributions by <mark>Intel</mark> and IPAC, examining the effectiveness, benefits, and risks to shareholder value associated with those contributions.”</P><P dir=""ltr"">The proposal landed on deaf ears, however. <mark>Intel</mark>’s board of directors recommended that <mark>Intel</mark>’s shareholders vote against the proposal, and the shareholders listened. <A href=""https://seekingalpha.com/article/4175263-<mark>intel</mark>-corporations-intc-ceo-brian-krzanich-hosts-2018-stockholders-meeting-transcript?part=single"" target=""_blank"">Only 7% of shareholders voted in favour of the proposal</A>. The previous year’s proposal to hold an annual advisory vote on political contributions was also <A href=""https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000050863/ec2aced0-c940-40c1-96b1-8ff895a5ec1d.pdf"" target=""_blank"">rejected by shareholders</A>, as per the recommendation of the board of directors.</P><P dir=""ltr"">We spoke with the director of shareholder activism at NorthStar Asset Management, Mari Schwartzer, who outlined proposal six made at the 2018 annual shareholders’ meeting.</P><P dir=""ltr"">“Regarding our shareholder proposal at <mark>Intel</mark> for this year, we would like <mark>Intel</mark> management to perform deeper analysis on political contributions made by the company and IPAC, specifically related to how the voting records of those political candidates may pose a risk to the company if and when they are misaligned with the company’s values, goals, and policies.” Schwartzer says. “The end goal is to encourage the company to perform this analysis in order to protect shareholder value from the risks that may come from misaligned political contributions, but also to encourage conversation within the company to evaluate candidates in a more complete, holistic manner.</P><P dir=""ltr"">“It is crucially important that we engage companies on their political contributions to help them understand that by supporting candidates that seek to undo social progress, the company and its employees may suffer.”</P><P dir=""ltr""><mark>Intel</mark> has also provided a response to the proposal in support of the board of director’s decision to vote against it.</P><P dir=""ltr"">“We regularly evaluate our political spending for effectiveness and alignment as part of our contributions process. We recognise that it is impractical and unrealistic to expect that our company, stockholders, and stakeholders will agree with every issue that a politician or trade association may support, particularly given our strategy of bipartisan giving. As part of our process, we assess recipients’ overall voting records related to our key policy issues and make funding decisions that we believe in aggregate will have the greatest benefit for our stockholders and key stakeholders.”</P><P dir=""ltr""><mark>Intel</mark>’s political donations are no secret. The company works with a high degree of transparency - evident by the <A href=""https://www.epacmanager.com/pass_sol/sol_<mark>intel</mark>/frmREPORTS.aspx"" target=""_blank"">database of candidates supported by <mark>Intel</mark>’s PAC</A>. The company’s spending is also evidently bipartisan throughout, with around 90 Democrat candidates receiving funding, and around 85 Republicans in 2018. Contributions also vary between both supporters and naysayers on many of the issues outlined in the proposal.</P><P dir=""ltr"">For NorthStar, however, the buck doesn’t end with transparency. The firm isn’t convinced <mark>Intel</mark>’s current course of action is accomplishing enough to combat what NorthStar refers to as ‘misaligned’ contributions.</P><P dir=""ltr"">“We find <mark>Intel</mark>’s response to the proposal to be insufficient,” Schwartzer says. “While <mark>Intel</mark> provides disclosure on its political contributions, simply disclosing contributions may not protect shareholder value, nor does it demonstrate comprehensive research in advance of these contributions.</P><P dir=""ltr"">&quot;We have engaged with <mark>Intel</mark> since 2012 regarding political contributions and what we view as issues with misalignment with company values and policies; however, we see no evidence that the company has taken steps to consider candidates’ voting records or public stances on issues like women’s rights, LGBT rights, or <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P dir=""ltr"">We have also spoken with representatives from <mark>Intel</mark> itself and the company is still standing by its initial response to the proposal, despite NorthStar finding that 'insufficient.'</P><P dir=""ltr"">It’s not the legality of these political contributions being brought into question, however, it’s whether these political relations could clash with <mark>Intel</mark>’s vocal stances on social issues, equality, and the environment, and could also damage the company’s socially-positive reputation.</P><P dir=""ltr"">In that regard, there is an obvious dichotomy of views between what <mark>Intel</mark> as a company holds dear and what IPAC determines is worthwhile, and net positive overall, when making contributions. Whether this funding has any effect on <mark>Intel</mark>’s reputation, however, is really up to many of you - <mark>Intel</mark>’s customers.</P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Femia said the <A href=""https://mashable.com/2016/09/21/national-security-<mark>climate</mark>-change-risk-obama/""><mark>intel</mark>ligence community has agreed</A> that <mark>climate change</mark> is a threat to the U.S. since the George W. Bush administration, so this isn't simply a case of Trump trying to erase an Obama White House's policy.</P><P>“It’s a really odd throwback,” he said. “It sends a signal that I think can make it more difficult for the military to do its job in adapting to these risks,” Femia said. </P><P>Past reports have identified sea level rise, droughts, and Arctic sea ice melt as issues that the U.S. military already must already contend with, with growing impacts as the world continues to warm. </P><P>“The Administration’s National Security Strategy won’t stop Arctic ice from melting. It will continue to melt at an increasing rate and our national security leaders know that we need to address it as we manage many other risks from <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; said David Titley, director of the Center for Solutions to Weather and <mark>Climate</mark> Risk at Penn State University and a Rear Admiral in the Navy, in an email. </P><P>Interestingly, the Trump administration's security strategy contains both a reference to the need to continue reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which are the main cause of global warming, as well as phrasing which is typically used to refer to developing more fossil fuel resources, which would emit more greenhouse gases. </P><P>&quot;U.S. leadership is indispensable to countering an anti-growth energy agenda that is detrimental to U.S. economic and energy security interests,&quot; the document states, using strikingly similar language to the Energy Department, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and White House when talking about bringing about a resurgence of the coal industry.</P><P>Trump's strategy also ignores the scientific studies which show that there is growing potential for <mark>climate change</mark> to undermine U.S. national security, and in fact this may already be occurring, such as in the <A href=""https://mashable.com/2015/03/02/global-warming-syria-civil-war/"">case of the civil war in Syria</A>. In addition, sea level rise is already increasing flooding woes at military facilities at home and abroad, particularly in the Norfolk, Virginia area, home to the largest naval base in the world.</P><P>The document also alludes to the potential for fossil fuels, such as coal, to alleviate poverty, which is a popular argument within the Trump administration, but one that ignores the major health risks associated with burning coal. </P><P>&quot;Given future global energy demand, much of the developing world will require fossil fuels, as well as other forms of energy, to power their economies and lift their people out of poverty,&quot; the document states. </P><P>The administration has been seeking to boost U.S. fossil fuel exports. Last week, for example, <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/12/13/scott-pruitt-and-a-crew-of-epa-aides-just-spent-four-days-in-morocco-promoting-natural-gas/"" target=""_blank"">EPA administrator Scott Pruitt was in Morocco</A>, pushing for liquified natural gas deals (which is not the typical role of an EPA leader).</P><P>Some countries, notably India and China, are trying to move away from coal and into renewables, such as solar power, as quickly as possible. </P></SECTION></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Businesses and government organizations exposed to these threats could well face staggering losses that <A href=""https://riskybusiness.org/"">jeopardize their bottom line</A> and sustainability of operations.</P><P>This week, a high-powered, well-funded start-up company has barged onto the scene to help businesses and governments confront their increasing vulnerability to <mark>climate change</mark> and weather disasters. Using cutting edge technology, it could revolutionize how they receive information about weather and <mark>climate</mark> threats and make critical planning decisions.</P><DIV class=""inline-content inline-photo-right"" style=""width:210px;""><SPAN class=""pb-caption"">Rich Sorkin.</SPAN></DIV><P><A href=""https://jupiter<mark>intel</mark>.com/"">Known as Jupiter</A>, the company was founded in 2017 by Rich Sorkin, a serial entrepreneur who has worked with Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk. Sorkin was Musk’s first boss as chief executive of Zip2, a company that provided business directories to online newspapers in the late 1990s.</P><P>Over the past year, Sorkin and his team have plucked <mark>climate</mark> and data scientists from top research institutions and corporations while hiring information technology professionals from the likes of Google and General Electric.</P><P>The weather and <mark>climate</mark> risk industry has not seen a company enter the space with this mix of financial backing, technology and <mark>intel</mark>lectual heft in years, if ever.</P><P>“The risks related to severe weather and <mark>climate change</mark> are among the greatest challenges of our generation,” Sorkin said in an interview with The Washington Post. “There are many different pieces of that problem. We’re focused on quantifying those risks in a way that lends decision-makers across-the-board understanding of the human health and safety and economic consequences and [help them] do a better job planning for and mitigating them.”</P><P>Headquartered in Silicon Valley and with branch offices in New York and Boulder, Jupiter has 22 full-time employees and has secured $10 million in venture capital. Its advisory team is led by <A href=""https://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/Pages/wolin-e.aspx"">Neal Wolin</A>, who served as deputy secretary of the Treasury Department in the Obama administration; Todd Stern, who was Obama’s chief <mark>climate</mark> negotiator at the State Department; and Jeff Wecker, <A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/a-tech-veteran-has-joined-goldman-sachs-after-leaving-the-biggest-hedge-fund-in-the-world-2017-10"">chief data officer at Goldman Sachs</A>.</P><P>Sorkin said he plans to expand internationally, first in Europe in the next year and in Asia in 2019. The company is working feverishly to roll out products tailored to specific locations, “expanding city by city at an ever accelerating pace.”</P><P>Jupiter has developed tools to help customers plan for hazards two hours to 50 years into the future all the way down to the street or even building level. The foundation is its <mark>Climate</mark>Score platform, which leverages cloud computing to run and link multiple prediction models that ingest data from millions of ground-based and satellite sensors.</P><DIV class=""inline-content inline-graphic-embedded""><SPAN class=""pb-caption"">(Jupiter)</SPAN></DIV><P>The first two products in Jupiter’s portfolio are called FloodScore and HeatScore. They’re intended to help customers manage the risks associated with intensifying precipitation events and heat waves in a warming world.</P><P>FloodScore and HeatScore predict not only precipitation and temperature changes, but also simulate their interactions with the built environment and the surrounding landscape and how they’re altered by <mark>climate change</mark>. In the assessing flood risk in New Orleans,  for example, the analytical framework would take into account the convergence of wetlands and concrete and sea level rise, Sorkin said.</P><DIV class=""inline-content inline-graphic-embedded""><SPAN class=""pb-caption"">(Jupiter)</SPAN></DIV><P>Jupiter will introduce FireScore, that evaluates the risk of wildfires, and other services later this year.</P><P>Sorkin believes Jupiter’s use of cloud computing will enable it to expand its products and services at a breakneck pace. “Our ability to chain together multiple models in the cloud in a statistically rigorous way, allows us to go much, much faster — from both a development and deployment perspective,” Sorkin said. “It let’s you go from one customer in one city to hundreds to thousands of customers all over the world fairly quickly.”</P><P>Its modeling will also employ machine learning to supplement underlying data and improve the representation of physics-based processes like clouds, whose behavior is very difficult to simulate, and interactions between the natural and built environment, a flood at a chemical plant, for example.</P><P>Sorkin pointed out many available <mark>climate</mark> information tools furnished by government-led assessments are not updated regularly enough to meet the needs of businesses. He said Jupiter’s  simulations will be available on demand and based on the latest science and available data.</P><P>“The Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and regional <mark>climate</mark> panels do an excellent job but run about every 5 years,” he said. “They tend to be academic, they’re often not statistically rigorous, and there’s no consistent methodology across them. They’re not designed for the private sector. We’re taking the same models and people [used in those assessments] and integrating into a regularly run reusable framework and making  them available at scale.”</P><P>Sorkin added this same framework will differentiate it from existing approaches that rely on the “fundamentally flawed” assumption that the <mark>climate</mark> of the past can simply be extrapolated into the future.</P><P>Jupiter has already begun working with property developers, critical infrastructure, insurance companies, and the public sector. Sorkin anticipates additional interest from city, state and national government to support solutions for health, safety, and planning as well as <mark>intel</mark>ligence and defense.</P><P>The demand for <mark>climate</mark> services is <A href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/n<mark>climate</mark>2836"">growing</A>, but a reasonable question is how reliable will information be at a local level for threats years to decades into the future. A <A href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015EF000338/full"">2016 academic paper</A> reviewing the current state of <mark>climate</mark> services noted many users seek this information but that the “predictability of <mark>climate</mark> variability on such timescales remains a debated question, and the provision of reliable predictions remains a scientific challenge.”</P><P>Sorkin, who says <mark>climate change</mark> is “real,” at the same time says “its impact in specific locations and at different time scales, as well as the confidence we should have in different predictions, is often poorly understood.”</P><P>Jupiter’s products will include information about how well its models are performing so that its users understand their strengths and limitations.</P><P>Betsy Weatherhead, an atmospheric scientist from  the University of Colorado and one of Sorkin’s early hires, said she is most excited about “translating fundamental science about <mark>climate</mark> to decisionmaking possibilities.” In an interview, she lauded Jupiter as a  “really pure” science-focused culture where providing “the most honest and reliable answers” is a priority.</P><P>Weatherhead is joined by Alan Blumberg from Stevens Institute of Technology who built a flood prediction system for New York City and Josh Hacker from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a pioneer in running weather models in the cloud, among several other <mark>climate</mark> scientists on Jupiter’s team.</P><P>Jupiter is bringing together very smart people to the weather and <mark>climate</mark> marketplace and new, potentially transformative technology. But David Titley, the director of Penn State’s Center for Weather and <mark>Climate</mark> Risk and not involved in the company, says it will need to demonstrate its worth.</P><P>Titley said competition in the space includes CoreLogic, an information <mark>intel</mark>ligence firm out Irvine, Calif., that <A href=""http://www.corelogic.com/solutions/natural-hazard-risk.aspx"">conducts property-level risk assessment</A> for the insurance industry and addresses both storm and fire hazards.  He also mentioned Coastal Risk Consulting out of Plantation, Fla., which <A href=""http://coastalriskconsulting.com/about"">provides hyper-local flood risk assessment</A>.</P><P>For Jupiter, “the proof will be in execution, and why a client should believe Jupiter’s projections versus another group’s,” Titley said. “But there is likely a large market for this type of information.  If Jupiter can deliver on their sales pitch, they likely can be successful.”</P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""right-rail"" class=""col-xl-3 col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-10 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-0 layout""><DIV class=""moat-trackable pb-f-theme-normal pb-f-dehydrate-false pb-f-async-false full pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-capital_weather_gang-weather-heat-tracker"" moat-id=""capital_weather_gang/weather-heat-tracker|local"" data-chain-name=""no-name"" data-feature-name=""no-name"" data-feature-id=""capital_weather_gang/weather-heat-tracker"" data-pb-fingerprint=""0f9zk2eWQqB"" id=""fMbrMw1obn1kSq""><DIV id=""heat-tracker""><H3>2018 Heat Tracker</H3></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
