        </DIV><DIV class=""lead"" property=""description""><P>MAC directive - European Directive 2006/40/EC on mobile air-conditioning systems (MACs) – is one of a number ways European Union uses to combat global warming and <mark>climate change</mark>. MAC Directive has been introduced in 2006, bringing several limitations to the automotive manufacturers, with some of the limitations in place already since mid-2008. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""paragraphs""><P>
	The most significant limitation is the complete ban of MACs designed to use fluorinated greenhouse gases with a global warming potential (GWP) higher than 150. This limit has been set for any MACs fitted to vehicles type-approved on 1 January 2011 or later [1]. Although car manufacturers have prepared themselves to the new ban by introducing a number of their new platforms prior to the deadline, this ban has definitely forced development of new MACs using low GWP refrigerants to comply with legislation. <mark>Carbon</mark> dioxide, propane, butane, R152a and HFO1234yf has seen as potential candidates to substitute R134a. Finally, HFO1234yf has been chosen due to its properties, which allow substituting R134a with minimal conversion of existing MACs.</P><P>
	Due to insufficient supply of R1234yf the initial deadline for banning high GWP refrigerant systems has been postponed twice. The problem with supply is reported as solved [2] and starting from 1 January 2013 the ban is finally in place.</P><P><STRONG>Less harmful for the environment, potentially dangerous for humans</STRONG></P><P>
	Although R1234yf is nothing new and the substance is already known for more than 50 years, it has been just few years back when its properties have started to be carefully investigated. Since 2007, when Honeywell and DuPont introduced R1234yf to the automotive industry, the substance has undergone a lot of testing for its properties, effectiveness and safety. In comparison with R134a – refrigerant mostly used in MACs today - R1234yf has very similar properties and characteristics, but much lower GWP of 4 (compare to 1430 of R134a).</P><P>
	Although R1234yf is less harmful to the environment than the currently used refrigerant, it is potentially dangerous as it is flammable and ignites at 405 <SUP>º</SUP> C [3]. When flammable – it is also emits hydrogen fluoride - dangerous substance for the human health. Information about the possibility of spontaneous combustion and possible formation hydrofluoric acid is alarming and made a number of parties to make tests on its safety.</P><P>
	SAE International - International Society of Automotive Engineers association of about 133,000 engineers and technicians - tested the substance in a special research program, which lasted five years. The conclusion was that the refrigerant R1234yf can be used safely in vehicles that are designed for the new refrigerant. This conclusion triggered active implementation of R1234yf in wide variety of MACs, including those installed in new Cadillac XTS, Toyota Prius+, Mercedes B-class and others.</P><P>
	<mark>Daimler AG</mark> - the concern behind Mercedes, Maybach, Smart, and many others brands - has recently raised new safety concerns with the usage of R1234yf by following “real-life test scenario” which corresponds to a serious head-on collision in which the refrigerant line is severed [4]. The reproducible results demonstrated that refrigerant, which is otherwise difficult to ignite under laboratory conditions, can indeed prove to be flammable in a hot engine compartment (see Figure 1). In contrast, similar test showed no risks associated with the use of R134a (which is, however, legally no longer an option to be used in new models of vehicles). Daimler reacted to its own finding by discontinuing using R1234yf in its vehicles [4] and by recalling 432 potentially affected Mercedes-Benz SL-Class vehicles to replace R-1234yf with R-134a [5].</P><DIV class=""tlc cid-1_426736 no-categories block figure "" lang=""en-UK""><DIV class=""imageWrapper""><DIV class=""footer"" style=""max-width: 386px;""><DIV class=""footerInner""><DIV class=""title"">
                Figure 1 – Inflammation of R1234yf in a vehicle engine compartment: a snapshot from the Daimler test’s video, as available at: http://bit.ly/daimlertest
              </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P><STRONG>R1234yf flammability is nothing new</STRONG></P><P>
	DuPont – a company behind the R1234yf manufacturing denies the risks associated with R1234yf flammability claiming that Daimler test “does not represent new information”. The company refers to a number of organizations, who earlier expressed confidence in R-1234yf as substance to be safely used as refrigerant in MACs [6]. In face of new findings by Daimler, SAE International has decided to perform an updated engineering analysis based on the most recent information [7].</P><P>
	Full details of the Daimler simulation have not been made public yet, bringing suspicions on how the tests were conducted and what conditions were represented. Hence, some parties expressed doubts on reasons Daimler has behind publishing the tests close to MAC Directive ban’s introduction date, when the safety concerns of R1234yf has been known for years [8].  Back in 2010 German Environment Agency has already warned carmakers against R1234yf which was named as an “unsafe temporary solution” risking the life of drivers and rescue personnel. It was shown that low volumes of hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s (which can be easily present in the vehicle engine compartment) decrease required autoignition concentration of R1234yf from 6.2 (pure refrigerant) to as low as 0.5-1.3% [9].</P><P><STRONG>CO<SUB>2</SUB> as an alternative</STRONG></P><P>
	Given that Daimler denied usage of R1234yf by now – the most viable alternative for them to use is CO<SUB>2</SUB>. It has a number of advantages: the substance is also <mark>climate</mark>-friendly, non-flammable, widely available and otherwise relatively harmless. The main disadvantage is an increased cost of components of the CO<SUB>2</SUB> MAC system and performance issues in warm <mark>climate</mark>s. There is also safety concern associated with CO<SUB>2</SUB> in the event of its leak into the passenger area.  </P><P>
	VW and BMW has been expressed interest in CO<SUB>2</SUB> as a feasible, safe long-term refrigerant option.  However, Daimler itself has not announced any decision on this matter, thus considering any options. Recognizing interest to CO<SUB>2</SUB>, SAE International has announced plans to fully evaluate CO<SUB>2</SUB> option in MAC [10].</P><P>
	Given that MAC Directive requirements are already in action, the European Commission will make efforts to ensure the Member States comply on it, as it was confirmed in recent EC declaration [11]. In this renewed “refrigerant war”, CO<SUB>2</SUB> and R1234yf both have own advantages and disadvantages. Anyway, CO<SUB>2</SUB> has been given its second chance to become low GWP refrigerant choice for MACs of the future. However, by now R1234yf remains the only viable option as already available to be installed in new vehicles, bringing optimism to environmentalists and some fear to the drivers.</P><P><STRONG>References</STRONG></P><TABLE border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""><TBODY><TR><TD colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""><P>

This is an observation that spans all aspects of global depletion related to food choice, including the topic of loss of biodiversity and extinction of species. </P><P>The statement that animal agriculture is the primary driver of biodiversity loss and extinction of species is supported by many discussions and interviews with leading authors and scientists working for the Convention of Biodiversity and IUCN as well as publications regarding current biodiversity assessments as presented by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the IUCN Red List, and the Global Environmental and Biodiversity Outlook.</P><P>Most organizations that associate their work with species and ecosystem/biodiversity concerns as well as the scientific community as a whole believe that the six main threats to our oceans are <mark>climate change</mark>, overfishing, predator loss, <mark>pollution</mark>, destruction of habitat, and bycatch, (“bykill”).</P><P>(For instance: The Species Survival Commission of the World Conservation Union and the Convention on Biological Diversity).</P><P>As of August 2012, the 2004 Global Species Assessment was the most recent empirical data on global extinction rates, based on birds, mammals, and amphibians. According to an interview conducted by Dr. Oppenlander with Simon Stuart, PhD, chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission:</P><P>“Habitat loss from grazing livestock and feed crops is far and away the most pervasive threat to terrestrial animal species, impacting 86 percent of all mammals, 88 percent of amphibians, and 86 percent of all birds. One in every eight birds, one in every three amphibians, and one in every four mammals is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the near future. Overexploitation of wild animals for consumption remains a second major factor for extinction, such as can be seen in bushmeat trade in Africa and Southeast Asia and all hunting endeavors on land, globally.” </P><P>The Alliance for Global Conservation estimates 36 percent of all species on our planet are in danger of extinction.</P><P>Scientists have divided our planet into 825 terrestrial “ecoregions” (as well as 450 freshwater and a number of oceanic ecoregions), each defined by its own distinct set of animal and plant species, as well as <mark>climate</mark>. Of all these land ecoregions, almost half are reported by lead scientists (interviews/discussions) to have livestock as a current threat. The World Conservation Union reported in 2010 that “most of the world’s endangered or threatened species” on their Red List (which lists the species that are most endangered) are suffering habitat loss due to livestock—not due to agriculture but to livestock.</P><P>The Convention on Biological Diversity, held in Nagoya, Japan, in October 2010 agreed that none of their goals from 2002 for lessening the rate of biodiversity loss were met. The attendees confirmed that the main pressures for the rapid loss of species—habitat change, overexploitation, <mark>pollution</mark>, invasive species, and <mark>climate change</mark>—were all increasing in intensity.</P><P>Current biodiversity assessments (as presented by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the IUCN Red List, and the Global Environmental and Biodiversity Outlook) now generally agree that land use change, modification of river flow, freshwater <mark>pollution</mark>, and exploitation of marine environments are the most significant drivers of biodiversity change and loss of species. Because more than 50% of the land use changes on Earth are related to livestock (ILRI), 70 to 90% of freshwater <mark>pollution</mark> in western countries (particularly the U.S. and China) can be traced back to animal agriculture, minimally 14.5% of anthropogenic GHG emissions/<mark>climate change</mark>, and 100% of “exploitation of marine environments” is related to the global commercial fishing industry, it can be safely and confidently demonstrated that “the primary driver of global species’ extinctions and loss of biodiversity is animal agriculture.” </P><P> </P><P>[xx] The amount of water, land and fuel used for differing diets varies greatly from the types of foods consumed, amount consumed and the geographical region where the food was raised. Taking into consideration that 1lb of beef requires upwards of 2500 gallons of water to produce compared to only 25 gallons for 1lb of wheat, the water footprint of a person consuming a high meat diet could be 100x greater than that of a person consuming only plant foods. The same applies for land and oil use. Many arid areas of the world can not support 1 cow per 2 acres and require 50+ acre per cow, compared to a crops such as potatoes that can produce 50,000lbs+ per acre. The energy/fuel inputs are similar. 1 calorie of beef can take 27x more energy to produce than soybeans. </P><P>xxi (New) As of 2016 the estimates of wild horses and burros has increased on the range to 67,027 and the amount of wild horses and burros in holding fcailities is more than 45,000.

It contributes about one-fifth of the EU's total emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>).</P><P>Road transport is one of the few sectors where emissions have been rising rapidly over the last 20 years, with the exception of the period 2008 to 2010 when lower transport activity due to the economic slowdown brought a drop in CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions. In the period 1990 to 2010 emissions from road transport increased by 22.6%. This increase acted as a brake on the EU's progress in cutting overall emissions of greenhouse gases, which fell by 15.4%.</P><P>Passenger cars alone are responsible for around 12% of EU CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions. Although there have been significant improvements over recent years in vehicle technology – particularly in fuel efficiency, which translates into lower CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions – these have not been enough to neutralise the effect of increases in traffic and vehicle size.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">What is the EU's objective?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The <A href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32009R0443"">EU Regulation on passenger cars</A> is the first main measure of the <A href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/vehicles_en"">EU Strategy to reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from light-duty vehicles</A>(cars and vans). Under the Regulation, average CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from cars should not exceed 130 grams CO<SUB>2</SUB> per km by 2015 and should drop further to 95g/km by 2020.

As of 2012, manufacturers must ensure that 65% of the new cars registered in the EU each year have average emissions that are below their respective targets. The percentage rises to 75% in 2013, 80% in 2014 and 100% in 2015.</P><P>Indicative emissions are established for each car according to its mass on the basis of the emissions limit value curve in Annex I in the Regulation. The limit value curve is set in such a way that a fleet average of 130 grams of CO<SUB>2</SUB> per km is achieved for the EU as a whole.</P><P>Only the fleet average is regulated, so manufacturers will still be able to make vehicles with emissions above their indicative targets if these are offset by other vehicles which are below their indicative targets.</P><P>In order to comply with the regulation, a manufacturer will have to ensure that the overall sales-weighted average of all its new cars does not exceed the limit value curve. The curve for passenger cars is also set in such a way that, compared to today, emissions from heavier cars will have to be reduced by more than those from lighter cars.</P><P>The precise formula for the limit value curve is:</P><P>Permitted specific emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB> = 130 + a × (M – M0)</P><P>Where:</P><UL><LI>a = 0.0457</LI></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">What if a manufacturer does not meet its target?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>If a manufacturer's average emission levels are above the target set by the limit value curve it will have to pay an excess emissions premium. The more a manufacturer goes above the target, the higher the premium. It will be calculated on the basis of the number of grams per kilometre (g/km) that an average vehicle registered by the manufacturer is above the target, multiplied by the number of cars registered by the manufacturer. A premium of €5 per car registered will apply to the first g/km above the target, €15 for the second g/km, €25 for the third g/km, and €95 for each further g/km. From 2019 every g/km of exceedence will cost €95.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How does this legislation differ from legislation on light commercial vehicles (vans)?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The vans legislation is closely modelled on the legislation for cars. However, as the car market differs from the van market, there are some differences between the two regulations.</P><P>The limit value curve is different in its value and its slope because cars are lighter and emit less CO<SUB>2</SUB> than vans. Therefore, the limit value curve is flatter for cars, meaning that more reductions are required from larger cars. This is not the case for vans, because there is little risk of an uncontrolled increase in the size of vans.</P><P>The phase-in period for vans also starts later than for cars because the light commercial vehicles regulation was adopted later. The rules on derogations for small-volume manufacturers are also different.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How are the manufacturers placed in relation to their targets?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The chart below shows the actual position of the various car manufacturers in terms of the average CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions of the new cars they manufactured in 2006 (the year on which the Regulation's impact assessment was based).</P><P>The up-to-date information on average CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions of different manufacturers is available at the <A href=""http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/<mark>co2</mark>-cars-emission-2"">European Environment Agency's website</A>.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How will manufacturers' progress be monitored?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The relevant national authorities in each Member State will report annual registration figures for new cars to the European Commission, which will collate the data. Manufacturers will be invited to check that the data is correct. On that basis the Commission will publish, by 31 October each year, a list showing the performance of each manufacturer in terms of its average emissions and compliance with the annual emissions target. This will allow manufacturers' progress to be tracked.

When calculating the average emissions of each manufacturer's fleet, each low-emitting car will be counted as 3.5 vehicles in 2012 and 2013, reducing to 2.5 in 2014, 1.5 vehicles in 2015 and one vehicle from 2016. This will lower the manufacturer's average emissions as calculated by the Commission, making it easier to meet the target.</P><H4>Eco-<mark>innovation</mark>s</H4><P>Because the test procedure used for EU vehicle type approval is outdated, certain innovative technologies cannot demonstrate their CO<SUB>2</SUB>-reducing effects under the type approval test. As an interim procedure until the test procedure is revised, manufacturers which fit new cars with approved &quot;eco-<mark>innovation</mark>s&quot; that reduce emissions will be able to count up to 7 g/km worth of emission savings towards the 130 g/km target. The savings must be independently verified.

The Commission has a comprehensive strategy, adopted in 2007, which sets the objective of limiting average CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from new vehicles to 120 g/km. This is to be achieved through setting emissions performance standards for cars and vans and through additional measures that can bring a further reduction of 10 grams CO<SUB>2</SUB> per km.</P><P>Furthermore, to promote the purchase of fuel-efficient cars, an EU-wide system of consumer information on the CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions of all new cars is in operation.</P><P>Member States are also encouraged to promote fuel-efficient cars through their vehicle taxation policies.</P><P>Besides the regulation limiting CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from new passenger cars, which was adopted in April 2009, the measures being taken to implement the strategy are:</P><UL><LI>EU legislation to reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from new light commercial vehicles (adopted in May 2011)</LI><LI>Improvements to car components with the highest impact on fuel consumption, such as:</LI><LI>standards on rolling resistance of tyres,</LI><LI>standards on the efficiency of mobile air conditioning,</LI><LI>on-board indicators incentivising more efficient driving,</LI><LI>gradual reduction in the <mark>carbon</mark> content of road fuels, notably through increased use of sustainably produced biofuels.</LI></UL><P>For more details on the implementation of the Strategy, see the <A href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52010DC0656"">progress report</A> adopted in November 2010.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">What is the next step?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The Regulation on cars is directly applicable in the Member States and does not need to be transposed into national law through national legal instruments.</P><P>The Regulation is currently being reviewed with a view to implementing the 2020 target of 95 g/km.</P></DIV></DIV><H2>Questions and answers on the proposed Regulation defining the modalities for reaching the 2020 target for CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from new cars (July 2012)</H2><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How much will the 2020 mandatory target save consumers in lower fuel bills?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The 2020 target for cars of 95 g CO<SUB>2</SUB>/km implies reductions in annual fuel consumption to private users and business owners of 27% compared with the 2015 mandatory target of 130g. For an average car, it is estimated the consumer will save some €340 in the first year, and a total of €2904-3836 (depending on the price of fuel) over the car's lifetime (13 years), as compared with the 2015 target. The higher the oil price, the greater the overall savings will be.</P><P>For both cars and vans, the 'payback period' – the time it takes for cumulative fuel cost savings to outweigh the additional cost of buying a more fuel-efficient vehicle - is below five years. Net cost savings over a vehicle's lifetime are estimated at around €2000 for cars and €2500 for vans.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Will the 2020 target increase the price of cars?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>It may do, but this depends on how far producers pass on additional manufacturing costs through higher vehicle prices. The average additional manufacturing cost is estimated at around €1100 per car in 2020. Even if the full additional cost is passed on through higher prices, the Commission's impact assessment shows that this extra cost to purchasers will be outweighed several times over by fuel cost savings over the lifetime of the vehicle. Over the past decade new car prices have decreased on average by about 1% annually while fuel consumption and CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions have also fallen every year. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) has stated that <A href=""http://www.acea.be/collection/<mark>co2</mark>_emissions_faq_on_<mark>co2</mark>/"">this trend is not likely to change</A>.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Will the tighter emission targets be bad for the economy?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>No, on the contrary. The proposals are expected to stimulate research and <mark>innovation</mark> in the automotive sector, promoting green growth and jobs and improving the international competitiveness of the EU industry. The impact assessment shows that the regulations would shift spending from fuel, which has a low impact on employment, to vehicle technology and other goods.</P><P>Compared with the 2015/2017 targets for cars and vans, it is estimated that consumers will save €27bn per year in fuel costs in 2025, rising to €36bn in 2030. The 2020 targets could increase EU GDP by €12bn annually and spending on employment by some €9bn a year.</P><P>The proposals would in total save almost 160 million tonnes of oil, worth about €70bn at today's prices, in the period to 2030. They would also prevent the emission of around 420 million tonnes of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, over the same period, resulting in net cost savings to society of €100-200 for every tonne of CO<SUB>2</SUB> avoided.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Will older vehicles have to be taken off the road?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>No, the emission limits will apply only to new vehicles. Those sold before 2020 will not be affected and will not have to be taken off the road. But the lower fuel costs of the new vehicles will provide a powerful incentive for replacing old cars and vans.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How does the 2020 target compare with current emission levels?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The 2020 mandatory target for cars of 95g CO<SUB>2</SUB>/km is 27% lower than the 2015 target of 130 g/km and 30% below last year's average level of 135.7g/km.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How have the 2020 targets been set?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The 2020 targets were established during the political process involving the European Parliament and Council that led to the adoption of the existing Regulations. The Commission has verified that the 2020 targets are achievable at reasonable cost by carrying out a thorough analysis of the available technologies and of their costs and benefits.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Are the 2020 targets technically and economically feasible?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Yes, the Commission's assessment of the technologies currently available shows that these are available to allow manufacturers to reach the targets at reasonable cost. The technological potential remains for further reductions beyond 2020, particularly in the case of vans.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Has the Commission consulted stakeholders on its proposal?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Yes, an on-line public consultation on policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from road vehicles was held from September to December 2011. The <A href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/consultations/articles/0012_en"">results are available here</A>.</P><P>In addition, a stakeholder meeting was held in December 2011 where the results of the car and van analysis were presented (see <A href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/events/articles/0048_en"">here for summary of the meeting</A>), and the CARS21 High Level Group also discussed the targets.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Are the 2020 proposals in line with the recommendations of CARS21?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Yes, the key recommendations of the CARS21 High Level Group regarding the 2020 CO<SUB>2</SUB> targets were that they should be implemented without change. The Commission's proposals do that.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Are the proposals part of a wider strategy?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Yes. The Commission has a comprehensive strategy, adopted in 2007, to reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from new cars and vans. A wide range of measures has been implemented. For details see the <A href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/vehicles_en#tab-0-1"">Commission's progress report</A>. Following adoption of the latest <A href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52011DC0144"">Transport White Paper</A>, the Commission is now pursuing a comprehensive strategy to reduce GHG emissions from transport by 60% compared to 1990 levels by 2050. CO<SUB>2</SUB> standards for vehicles form a key part of this overall strategy.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Have the 2020 targets for cars and vans been set in the same way?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Yes, the underlying assessment is identical. It looks at the technologies available and their costs. The most appropriate way of distributing the effort is then assessed. While the assessment methodology is the same, the results are slightly different because of the different characteristics of the markets for cars and vans.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">How will small manufacturers comply?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>As in the existing regulations, manufacturers may form a pool to meet the mandatory emission targets jointly. When forming a pool, manufacturers must respect the rules of competition law; the information they exchange should be limited to average specific emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, their specific emissions targets, and their total number of vehicles registered.</P><P>In addition, smaller manufacturers benefit from provisions enabling them to have less demanding targets. The very smallest manufacturers registering less than 500 vehicles per year would be exempt from meeting the targets.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Why produce the proposals now?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The existing regulations state that the Commission should bring forward proposals for implementing the 2020 targets by the end of this year. The Commission is doing so several months before the deadline so that the modalities can be agreed as early as possible in order to increase certainty for manufacturers.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Why make two separate proposals? Why not merge the Regulations?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>There are two existing regulations with slightly different requirements so it makes sense to have a separate amending measure for each one. The option of merging the regulations was assessed in the impact assessment, but because of the differences between the characteristics of the car and van markets and van testing procedures it was not possible to merge the requirements into one structure.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Will the proposals promote electric, hybrid and other alternative propulsion systems?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Yes, the proposed Regulations not only create an incentive to improve internal combustion engines using petrol and diesel but will also spur electric, plug-in hybrid, fuel cell, natural gas, and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas)-fuelled vehicles. Manufacturers will be free to reduce emissions in the most cost-effective manner. This is in line with the Commission's standard approach of being technology-neutral.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Isn't CO<SUB>2</SUB> being over-emphasised compared with other pollutants?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Other pollutants in vehicle emissions are regulated through EU legislation governing air quality and these are also being progressively reduced. The latest emission standards for these pollutants, known as Euro 6, come into force from 2014. Many technologies can reduce emissions of both CO<SUB>2</SUB> and the traditional pollutants which affect air quality.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">The European Parliament has asked for 2025 CO<SUB>2</SUB> targets for cars and vans. When will these be proposed?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The Commission has said it intends to issue a communication around the end of 2012 in order to carry out a consultation on the form and stringency of post-2020 CO<SUB>2</SUB> targets for light duty vehicles. It would be premature to propose the targets before that consultation has taken place.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Isn't the Commission's approach flawed since real world emissions are not the same as test cycle results?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>While it is clear that the emissions test cycle gives very different results from real world driving, there is no evidence that test cycle results do not correlate to real world emissions. A vehicle with lower emissions in the test cycle will also have lower emissions under real conditions.</P><P>The Commission is nevertheless taking part in international efforts to develop a new global test procedure for light duty vehicles and it is hoped that this will result in CO<SUB>2</SUB> values that are somewhat more realistic than the current test procedures.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Why has the Commission based its proposal on a vehicle's mass rather than other possible parameters?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The existing cars Regulation is based on a vehicle's mass and in drawing up its proposal for the 2020 target the Commission assessed a wide range of other possible bases for the future Regulation. All of these parameters except using the area of the vehicle (known as its 'footprint') were found to be undesirable. The possible use of footprint instead of mass was analysed in detail. It does offer some benefits, including slightly lower costs. However, it was considered that providing certainty for manufacturers ruled out a change of the basis for the regulation for 2020.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Will the proposals put certain car manufacturers at a disadvantage?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The impact assessment addressed the questions of competitive neutrality and social equity. These were assessed based on the relative retail price increase for different manufacturers and car segments. The Commission believes that its proposal is fair to all cars manufacturers taking into account the full range of factors to be considered.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Why include super credits?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The impact assessment says they increase emissions.</P><P>It is true that the impact assessment shows super credits can lead to increased CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions if significant use is made of them. However, super credits can also be seen as providing a strong incentive for manufacturers to develop and market technologies that will need to be deployed more extensively in the future. They can therefore be considered as a sort of technological stimulus.</P><P>For this reason it is appropriate to allow for super-credits for a period of four years while limiting the number of vehicles which can benefit from them to 20 000 cars per manufacturer over the duration of the scheme.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Why does the Commission not propose phasing in the 2020 limit over a number of years?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>Phasing in the new limit prior to 2020 would be more demanding on manufacturers and could make it more difficult for them to comply. On the other hand, phasing in the target starting 2020 onwards would weaken the Regulation and achieve lower CO<SUB>2</SUB> savings than the Council and European Parliament foresaw when requesting the 95g CO<SUB>2</SUB>/km target. This would not be helpful in view of the EU's target of reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to 1990 by 2020. It would also be contrary to the recommendation of the CARS21 High Level Group that the 95g/km target should be implemented in 2020.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordion""><H3 class=""question"">Will the limit value curve for 2020 have a different slope compared to the 2015 target?</H3><DIV class=""accordion-content""><P>The limit value curve serves to calculate the specific emission targets for an individual car manufacturer's fleet average. The curve describes the relationship between the CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions target and the mass of the vehicle (expressed in kgs). The curve implies that heavier cars are allowed higher emissions than lighter cars, while ensuring that the overall fleet average target of 95 g in 2020 is met.</P><P>For 2020 the slope of the curve would remain at 60%, based on 2006 fleet data, the same as in the legislation for 2015. The line proposed by the Commission would require the same level of reduction effort (27%) from all vehicle types as compared to the 2015 limits. This 27% reduction represents the difference between the 2015 target of 130g and the 2020 target of 95g. As a result, the relative effort for each manufacturer is not altered.</P></DIV></DIV></DD></DL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""sidebar-right"" class=""col-lg-3 col-md-12 col-sm-0 col-xs-0 sidebar-right  hidden-print""><DIV class=""region region-sidebar-right""><DIV id=""block-views-clima-read-more-block"" class=""block block-views panel panel-default clearfix""><DIV class=""panel-heading"">

Agriculture is an emissions-intensive sector; it accounted for less than 1 percent of U.S. production (in real gross value-added terms), but emitted 10 percent of U.S. GHGs in 2014. Energy-related CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission sources—which dominate GHG emissions in most other production sectors—are dwarfed in agriculture by unique crop and livestock emissions of nitrous oxide and methane. Crop and pasture soil management generates the most GHG emissions, due largely to the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers and other nutrients. Enteric fermentation (digestion in ruminant livestock) and manure management ranks second. Agriculture and forestry are unique in providing opportunities for withdrawing <mark>carbon</mark> from the atmosphere through biological sequestration in soil and biomass <mark>carbon</mark> sinks. The <mark>carbon</mark> sinks, which are largely due to land use change from agricultural to forest land (afforestation) and forest management on continuing forest, offset 11.5 percent of total U.S. GHG emissions in 2014 (see <A data-id=""15176"" href=""/topics/natural-resources-environment/<mark>climate</mark>-change/agricultural-production-and-mitigation/"" title=""Agricultural Production and Mitigation"">Agricultural Production and Mitigation</A>).</P><H3>The National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment</H3><P>The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) aims &quot;to assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.&quot; In this role, every four years it produces a National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment (NCA) that surveys and synthesizes the most recent science about <mark>climate change</mark> impacts and adaptation in the United States.

Combined with other <mark>climate</mark> impacts, these effects are projected to lead to large declines in salmon populations.<SUP><A href=""#ref1"">[1]</A>,<A href=""#ref11"">[11]</A>,<A href=""#ref12"">[12]</A></SUP></LI></UL><P>In addition to warming, the <A href=""/<mark>climate</mark>-impacts/<mark>climate</mark>-impacts-coastal-areas"">world's oceans</A> are gradually becoming more acidic due to increases in atmospheric <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>).

Increases in the frequency and severity extreme weather events can also interrupt food delivery, and resulting spikes in food prices after extreme events are expected to be more frequent in the future.  Increasing temperatures can contribute to spoilage and contamination.   </P><P><A href=""/<mark>climate</mark>-impacts/international-<mark>climate</mark>-impacts"">Internationally</A>, these effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on agriculture and food supply are likely to be similar to those seen in the United States. However, other stressors such as population growth may magnify the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on food security. In developing countries, adaptation options like changes in crop-management or ranching practices, or improvements to irrigation are more limited than in the United States and other industrialized nations.</P><P>Any <mark>climate</mark>-related disturbance to food distribution and transport, internationally or domestically, may have significant impacts not only on safety and quality but also on food access. For example, the food transportation system in the United States frequently moves large volumes of grain by water. In the case of an extreme weather event affecting a waterway, there are few, if any, alternate pathways for transport.  High temperatures and a shortage of rain in the summer of 2012 led to one of the most severe summer droughts the nation has seen and posed serious impacts to the Mississippi River watershed, a major transcontinental shipping route for Midwestern agriculture. This drought resulted in significant food and economic losses due to reductions in barge traffic, the volume of goods carried, and the number of Americans employed by the tugboat industry. The 2012 drought was immediately followed by flooding throughout the Mississippi in the spring of 2013, which also resulted in disruptions of barge traffic and food transport.<SUP><A href=""#ref3"">[3]</A></SUP> Transportation changes such as these reduce the ability of farmers to export their grains to international markets, and can affect global food prices.</P><P>Impacts to the global food supply concern the United States because food shortages can cause humanitarian crises and national security concerns.  They also can increase domestic food prices. </P><P class=""pagetop""><A href=""#main-content"">Top of Page</A></P><H3>References</H3><P><SMALL>[1] USGCRP (2014). Hatfield, J., G.

I sure am. I have closely followed Formula 1 for decades now. But I suppose those of you who haven’t ever screamed at their TVs on race day while furiously running back and forth in the living room – may not completely understand. Experiencing the intense pressure in the pit lane, the extraordinary team effort and the emotional explosion when the race plan finally pays off at the finish line really got me hooked to this sport. </P><P>Apart from my personal excitement, racing has always been an integral part of the Mercedes DNA. The first-ever car named “Mercedes” – after the <A href=""https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/classic/history/emil-jellinek/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">daughter of Emil Jellinek</A> by the way – was a 35 hp racer. A pure rocket … at the time. This weekend the <A href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/mercedes-amg-petronas-formula-one-team/"" target=""_blank"">Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One team</A> and all the others will start the new Formula 1 season at the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. As a CEO, I’m confident our team will make a strong run at its 5th drivers’ and constructors’ championship title in a row. As a fan, I wish to see a whole bunch of close and exciting races! </P><P>Before this season kicks off is a good time for some reflection. People often ask me if Formula 1 is really still relevant. Isn’t it just a relic of the past given <mark>climate change</mark>, rising e-mobility and the self-driving future of mobility? I’m sure some of you have come over these discussions, too. </P><P>From my perspective Formula 1isabsolutely relevant! And maybe more so today than ever. Here are three reasons why. </P><H3><STRONG>F1 is a technology breeding ground</STRONG></H3><P>First: Formula 1 is a prime R&amp;D laboratory. Formula 1 racecars are the most connected cars out there. They are packed with sensors. In a 90-minute practice session, for example, the tire data alone equals the amount of data required for one full box set of Game of Thrones! </P><P>Plus, in 2014 the entire Formula 1 series switched to hybrid engines. We were able to gather a lot of experience with advanced hybrid technology. Last year, our engine achieved 50 per cent thermal efficiency on the dyno – that means: today’s Mercedes Formula 1 engine is able to transform half of the energy of the fuel into on-track performance. Road cars typically have a thermal efficiency rate of 30 to 35 per cent. And you can be sure that we take all we learn on the racetrack to make Mercedes engines and cars even more efficient on public roads. </P><P>Starting in 2019, for example, we will enter the fully electric “<A href=""https://www.daimler.com/<mark>innovation</mark>/efficiency/formula-e.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Formula E</A>” series. This exemplifies our mantra of pursuing future technologies without leaving proven ones behind: We are sharing smarts <EM>and</EM> selling S-Classes. We’ll hand out up to 12 different Mercedes models a year at a fixed monthly rate – and will at the same time sell public transport tickets through our <U>moovel</U> app. We offer high-tech diesels, plug-in hybrids, EVs <EM>and</EM> fuel cells. And we will support both Formula 1 and Formula E. </P><H3><STRONG>Cultural change testing ground </STRONG></H3><P>Next is <EM>culture</EM>. The number of staff allowed at the racetrack is limited to 60 engineers and mechanics. That means: every individual has to take full responsibility for their actions. Every individual can make a difference about winning or losing a race. And decisions are sometimes made on a thousandth-of-a-second basis. </P><P>Here again, motor sports teaches a lot about business: The <A href=""https://www.mercedesamgf1.com/en/mercedes-amg-f1/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport team</A> wins and loses together – as a team. They don’t look for scape goats. They look for solutions. If things go wrong – and things <EM>do</EM> go wrong – the team will strive to come back stronger in the next race. Every Sunday. Over and over again.</P><P>In this respect Formula 1 mirrors the cultural change we are shaping throughout our entire company with our <A href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/going-viral-cultural-change-dieter-zetsche/"" target=""_blank"">leadership 2020 program</A>: We want more speed and flexibility, more empowerment and individual responsibility and a new understanding of winning and failing <EM>as a team</EM> – so we learn and come back stronger.  </P><H3><STRONG>Emotional battle ground</STRONG></H3><P>Coming back stronger and putting in that last bit of effort required to take the trophy home in a close finish – that’s what makes my third and most important argument: pure emotion. More than 350 million people watched Formula 1 on TV in 2017: that’s a lot of people getting excited for a of couple hours every other weekend.</P><P>Formula 1 plays on some of the most fundamental human emotions: passion (for your favorite team or driver), dislike (for the other teams), agony (over a lost race) or euphoria (when it goes well) – along with the sensory experience that comes from the speed of the cars and roar of the engines. Formula 1 can provide everything one needs for a perfectly entertaining weekend. </P><P>All that’s why Mercedes keeps investing in racing. And it’s why I personally can’t wait for the new season to take off. I wish all drivers a safe and fair competition. And to our drivers and the entire Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport team: go for it, guys! </P></DIV><FOOTER id=""article-footer"" role=""contentinfo"" class=""article-author-wrapper article-author-footer""><DIV class=""entity-actions"" id=""entity-actions-footer""><DIV class=""tooltip-wrapper""><BUTTON class=""button-follow button-secondary-medium  tooltip-trigger""><SPAN class=""text text-default"">Follow</SPAN><SPAN class=""text text-active"">Following</SPAN><SPAN class=""text text-active-hover"">Unfollow</SPAN><SPAN class=""accessible-text"">Dieter Zetsche</SPAN></BUTTON></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Measurements taken on the prototype system for a research project by the Federal Ministry for Environment confirm the high performance of CO<SUB>2</SUB> as a refrigerant for mobile air conditioning. The CO<SUB>2</SUB> system cools the vehicle interior very fast and is energy-efficient. Under normal European summer weather conditions, the new mobile air conditioning system with CO<SUB>2</SUB> uses even less energy than the serially produced system with R134a. Measurements taken by the German Automobile Club (ADAC) confirmed these findings.</P><P>After 165,000 kilometres vehicle mileage, the CO<SUB>2</SUB> <mark>climate</mark> compressor – the heart of every air conditioning system – performed well and was still very tight. The prototype mobile air conditioning system in the UBA official car was retrofitted in summer 2015 with a new CO<SUB>2</SUB> compressor. It was designed to meet the latest manufacturer requirements in terms of geometry and dimensions. At the time a heat exchanger was also replaced since the prototype part showed outside corrosion. The new CO<SUB>2</SUB>-compressor component proved its robustness in everyday operation till the end of the car operation in spring 2017.</P><H2>Prospects for CO<SUB>2</SUB> as a refrigerant</H2><P>Although CO<SUB>2</SUB> was already a real option for mobile air conditioning systems in the late 1990s, cars fitted with CO<SUB>2</SUB> air conditioning systems are rare on the market. One reason for the delay is that the air conditioning system with CO<SUB>2</SUB> required new development and testing of the pressure-resistant components for the refrigerant CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Since October 2016 first cars with CO<SUB>2</SUB> mobile air conditioning have been available in luxury cars by two German car manufacturers, and CO<SUB>2</SUB> systems were also announced for the future mass market.

The global economic recovery has produced mixed results for businesses trying to reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> footprints, according to the latest annual survey of some of the world's largest companies by the British nonprofit CDP.</P><P>
While overall emissions of greenhouse gases from CDP's &quot;Global 500&quot; have shrunk from 4.2 billion to 3.6 billion metric tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide equivalent since 2009, the index's 50 largest-emitting firms have actually seen greenhouse gas emissions rise by 1.65 percent over the same period, the organization has found.</P><P>
And although many companies are doing more than ever to assess their direct <mark>climate</mark> impacts, CDP found that 47 percent of the most <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive activities undertaken by business -- called &quot;scope 3&quot; emissions -- continue to go unmeasured and unreported. These include things like investment activity, the use and processing of sold products, and the operation of franchises.</P><P>
CDP, formerly the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project, is one of the world's leading collectors and disseminators of business sector data on greenhouse gas emissions, and its annual &quot;<A href=""https://www.cdproject.net/CDPResults/CDP-Global-500-<mark>Climate</mark>-Change-Report-2013.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Global 500 <mark>Climate Change</mark> Report</A>&quot; has become one of the leading indicators of how corporations are responding to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>
The analysis is based on <mark>climate</mark> and energy data submitted by 389 companies listed on the FTSE Global 500 Equity Index. While previous indexes have mostly stressed progress made by some of the world's best-known brands in addressing the complex challenges around <mark>climate change</mark>, the latest report also sounds a cautionary note about how much more needs to be done to make meaningful change in the world's <mark>climate</mark> profile.</P><P><STRONG>Can big emitters walk their talk?</STRONG>&quot;Many countries are demonstrating signs of recovery following the global economic downturn,&quot; Paul Simpson, CDP's chief executive officer, said in a statement. &quot;However, clear scientific evidence and increasingly severe weather events are sending strong signals that we must pursue routes to economic prosperity whilst reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. It is imperative that big emitters improve their performance in this regard and governments provide more incentives to make this happen.&quot;</P><P>
The report notes that three business sectors -- energy firms, utilities and materials companies -- account for 87 percent of scope 1 and 2 emissions, greenhouse gases that are directly emitted by a firm's activities, even though they account for less than 25 percent of all companies on the index. In fact, each of those three high-emitting sectors' scope 1 and 2 emissions are more than double the combined scope 1 and 2 emissions of all other sectors covered by the index, according to CDP.</P><P>
And although companies are pledging to do more than ever to reduce emissions, &quot;disparity [exists] between companies' strategies, targets and the emissions reductions&quot; that <mark>climate</mark> scientists say will be necessary to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius.</P><P>
For companies that are leading the CDP index, the report's authors say they &quot;demonstrate a strong commitment to managing their impact on the environment [and] are generating improved financial and environmental results.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Automakers lead reductions</STRONG>
This year's top index performers include a half-dozen automakers -- BMW AG, <mark>Daimler AG</mark>, General Motors Co., Honda Motor Co., Nissan Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, with scores of 100 or 99 -- along with Royal Philips NV, Nestle SA, BNY Mellon Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and Gas Natural SDG, all of which scored 100 points on the index.</P><P>
Officials attributed the strong showing by auto manufacturers to general improvements in fuel economy as well as growing manufacturer investment in hybrid and electric-powered vehicles. Automakers also have become leaders in disclosing their <mark>climate</mark> impacts across their large and complex supply chains.</P><P>
In a statement, Honda said it provided estimates of all its greenhouse gas emissions, &quot;including emissions from the procurement of raw materials to production and sales, and from customer use all the way to the end-of-life treatment of Honda products.&quot; Honda also said it was the world's first company to disclose all of its scope 3 emissions.</P><P>
The company said its strong showing in the CDP index reflects its environmental vision, which calls for realizing &quot;the joy and freedom of mobility&quot; and promoting &quot;a <mark>sustainable</mark> society where people can enjoy life.&quot;</P><P>
The top-ranked U.S. electric utility on the CDP list was Exelon Corp., with a score of 98. The other U.S. utilities reporting were American Electric Power Co. and Duke Energy Corp., which scored 68 and 67, respectively.</P><P>
Among the large U.S. firms scoring below 50 on the 2013 index are Costco Wholesale Corp. (45), Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (47), Mastercard Inc. (43) and Danaher Corp. (12).</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>wire with permission from Environment &amp; Energy Publishing, LLC. <A href=""https://www.eenews.net"" target=""_blank"">www.eenews.net</A>, 202-628-6500</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

And over the past year, many countries, particularly in the developing world, decided that an especially effective way to reach those targets is through their farms.</P><P><A href=""http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5666e.pdf"">Nearly 80 percent</A> of the countries said they would use agricultural practices to curb <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/<mark>climate</mark>-change"" target=""_blank""><mark>climate change</mark></A>, and more than 90 percent said they would use those practices in addition to changes in forestry and land use linked to farming.</P><P>&quot;2016 has been a very good year for agriculture and <mark>climate</mark>,&quot; said Martin Frick, director of <mark>climate</mark>, energy and tenure at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. &quot;It's become possible to finally discuss the elephant in the room.&quot;</P><P>When <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/21112016/paris-<mark>climate</mark>-change-agreement-cop-22-marrakech-donald-trump"" target=""_blank""><mark>climate</mark> negotiators gathered in Marrakech in November</A> to begin mapping out the process for reaching the Paris goals, groups hosted at least 80 agriculture-focused sessions.</P><P>&quot;Agriculture has really lagged,&quot; said Craig Hanson, director of the food, forests and water program at the World Resources Institute. &quot;Considering it contributes 13 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and 24 percent of net emissions with land-use change, it's surprising it's taken so long...But it's finally happening,&quot; he said.</P><P><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-d3dc987e-65ec-6d48-ff32-58555da8fdc7"">In the U.S., the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, agriculture's role in <mark>climate change</mark></SPAN> has been discussed mostly by advocacy groups. And while the Department of Agriculture has launched programs to increase farmland's capacity to capture <mark>carbon</mark>, those are voluntary. The U.S.'s plans for meeting the Paris goals rely mainly on energy and transportation.</P><P>When the U.N.'s Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> launched its first global <mark>climate</mark> summit in 1992, agriculture hardly even entered the conversation. It wasn't until about a decade ago that research began to show its contribution to global warming, with special attention paid to the ravages of deforestation for agriculture, especially palm oil.</P><P>&quot;The numbers are pretty staggering. Maybe even a third of greenhouse gas emissions come from the land—more than transportation—but that wasn't clear until 10 years ago,&quot; said Seth Shames, who leads policy research for EcoAgriculture Partners, a group focused on hunger, rural poverty and biodiversity. &quot;Those issues started getting discussed in the <mark>climate change</mark> community. The forest people were able to get organized...and there was less political resistance in the <mark>climate</mark> world.&quot;</P><P>In response, the UNFCCC <A href=""http://redd.unfccc.int/"">launched a program</A> that pays developing countries to preserve their <mark>carbon</mark>-absorbing forests, including standards for measuring, reporting and verifying the emissions cuts.</P><P>Similar standards haven't been developed yet for agriculture.</P><P>&quot;Right now, we don't have mechanisms in place to really capitalize on the benefits that agriculture mitigation strategies can provide,&quot; said Ernie Shea, president of Solutions From The Land, a collaboration of agricultural industry and conservation groups. &quot;Forestry's much further ahead on measuring impacts. We're not there yet with agriculture.&quot;</P><P>The conversation around agriculture's role in <mark>climate change</mark> stems from a sea change in negotiations themselves. In 2009, the <mark>climate</mark> summit in Copenhagen fell apart, largely, some believe, because countries bristled at the top-down approach that dictated what countries must do.</P><P>After Copenhagen, negotiators began working instead on a pledge-based approach.</P><P>&quot;The Paris agreement doesn't impose anything on member states, and turns it around and says: What can you bring to the table?&quot; Frick explained. &quot;This fundamental change in logic has had a tremendous impact for agriculture. Agriculture, for every single country, is one of the most sensitive areas—it's an emotional topic.&quot;</P><P>Ultimately, agriculture emerged as ripe for action. It is existentially linked to a country's very survival and increasingly under threat from weather extremes, drought and floods. Agriculture, in other words, has to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>, but also has a huge, unrealized potential to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark>. That can happen through farm practices like soil <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration through cover cropping, or by making existing farmland more productive and efficient.</P><P>&quot;Drought impacts, flooding, higher nighttime temperatures affecting pollination, new weeds, invasive species. There's an awareness in the agriculture community that we're at risk and we're not as resilient as we need to be,&quot; Shea said.</P><P>That risk is driving the discussion. Farm industry leaders and academics formed the North American <mark>Climate</mark> Smart Agriculture Alliance in 2015 to prompt changes in agricultural practices that have <mark>climate</mark> benefits. Shea says the alliance's approach, much like the approach at the international level, is to promote the idea that certain production techniques are not only better for the environment, but also for farm productivity. The alliance's members include the American Farm Bureau Federation, which continues to deny the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;People are turned off by the <mark>climate change</mark> conversation,&quot; Shea said. &quot;Once you get into a conversation about improving productivity, you can get into a conversation about co-benefits.&quot;</P><P>Greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector in developed countries average about 12 percent, compared to 35 percent in developing countries, which makes agriculture a relatively less important solution in industrialized countries. Still, advocates are pushing agricultural interests and regulators in the U.S. to do their part, pointing <A href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.13340/abstract"">to research</A> that says reaching the goals of the Paris agreement will be impossible without agriculture's contribution.</P><P>Educating farmers about the benefits—and using them to meet Paris targets—could provide the best way forward.</P><P>&quot;There's a lot of fatigue with the negativity on <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; said Thomas Driscoll, policy director at the National Farmers Union, the U.S.'s second largest farm group. &quot;Agriculture and <mark>climate change</mark> is exciting because there's a lot that can be done. Doing the right thing for the <mark>climate</mark> can save farmers money.&quot;</P><P>But challenges lie ahead. In both developing and advanced countries, many farmers can't afford to take <mark>climate</mark>-targeted steps—such as letting land lie fallow to regenerate—unless governments provide meaningful financial incentives.</P><P>In the plans that many countries submitted to reach their <mark>climate</mark> pledges, actual details around agriculture are scarce. And only one country—Rwanda—included plans to address food waste, which <A href=""http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/"">contributes 8 percent</A> of global greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>Homing in on those details and the precise strategies for cutting emissions is the work of the coming global talks.</P><P>&quot;The next five years is going to be period where we, as a community—researchers, agronomists, NGOs—are going to start thinking about what we can do, the bundle of things we can do in agriculture,&quot; Hanson said. &quot;We're on the agenda. Now we have to roll up our sleeves.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""tagged-with""><LABEL>Published Under:</LABEL></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The GLC F-CELL is a world’s first in at least two ways: it contains a compact fuel cell system which fits into a conventional engine compartment, and it holds a lithium-ion battery that serves as an additional energy source for the electric motor.</EM></P><P name=""d57f"" id=""d57f"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><EM class=""markup--em markup--p-em"">In a two-part interview, Prof. Dr. Christian Mohrdieck, Daimler’s Fuel Cell Director, talks to cH2ange about the new Mercedes-Benz GLC F-CELL, the benefits of hydrogen as a fuel and its essential role in <mark>sustainable</mark> low-<mark>carbon</mark> mobility. In part 1, Prof. Dr. Mohrdieck discusses the F-CELL vehicle itself, the engineering challenges involved in its development and the territories currently leading the way in hydrogen infrastructure.</EM></P><H4 name=""6d8a"" id=""6d8a"" class=""graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"">Firstly, can you tell us about the technical specifications of the Mercedes-Benz GLC F-CELL?</H4><FIGURE name=""363f"" id=""363f"" class=""graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--h4""><FIGCAPTION class=""imageCaption""><EM class=""markup--em markup--figure-em"">Prof. Dr. Christian Mohrdieck, Daimler’s Fuel Cell Director.</EM></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P name=""867d"" id=""867d"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--figure"">The F-CELL’s engine has a power output of 150kW (204 horsepower), which is a significant power level for this type of car. It also offers an impressive driving range. This depends on driver behavior and we are waiting for confirmation of the numbers, but we expect the F-CELL to achieve a range of around 500km, based on the New European Driving Cycle.</P><BLOCKQUOTE name=""297b"" id=""297b"" class=""graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"">“The power level and acceleration are the same as you’d expect from any Mercedes-Benz car, whether internal combustion engine (ICE) or hybrid.”</BLOCKQUOTE><H4 name=""b8cb"" id=""b8cb"" class=""graf graf--h4 graf-after--pullquote""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--h4-strong"">What distinguishes the F-CELL from other hydrogen vehicles?</STRONG></H4><P name=""f05b"" id=""f05b"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--h4"">There are two main distinctions, the first of which concerns performance. The power level and acceleration are the same as you’d expect from any Mercedes-Benz car, whether internal combustion engine (ICE) or hybrid. It also offers the same high level of safety, quality and comfort.</P><P name=""13a3"" id=""13a3"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">The second distinction is that this car is a plug-in fuel cell hybrid, which is a first for a series production vehicle. This combination of fuel cell and plug-in battery is ideal given the progressive development of the hydrogen infrastructure. The car’s lithium battery has an energy capacity of about 9 kWh, giving the car an additional range of about 50km. It has an onboard charger so it can be charged at any socket or charging station.</P><H4 name=""183c"" id=""183c"" class=""graf graf--h4 graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--h4-strong"">What are the main differences between the F-CELL and a conventional car?</STRONG></H4><P name=""b640"" id=""b640"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--h4"">Firstly, it’s a zero emissions car — no emissions at all, just water vapor coming out of the tailpipe. Secondly, the car has tremendous acceleration. This is due to the electric drivetrain that provides instantaneous torque, even at zero rpm (rotation per minute). The third feature that is very noticeable is that the car is extremely quiet, in terms of both audible noise and also vibration. It’s a smooth and very comfortable driving experience.</P><BLOCKQUOTE name=""5e4e"" id=""5e4e"" class=""graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"">“We reduced the amount of platinum by 90%, which provides a significant cost reduction.

This meant designing the fuel cell to very specific geometrical dimensions. An additional requirement was crash worthiness, which is not only about shape and dimensions but also the positioning of soft and rigid parts in order to achieve the desired crash behavior. As a result, we can say that this car fulfills the same very high crash standards as any other Mercedes-Benz car.</P></DIV><DIV class=""section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn""><FIGURE name=""0f45"" id=""0f45"" class=""graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p""><FIGCAPTION class=""imageCaption"">Mercedes-Benz GLC-F-CELL, drive system, © Daimler AG</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><DIV class=""section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn""><P name=""2f37"" id=""2f37"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--figure"">The other issue on packaging was where to situate the sizeable hydrogen cylinders. We found two very good locations. Rear wheel drive ICE cars have a driveshaft tunnel to drive the rear wheels, which isn’t necessary with an electric motor because it is mounted directly to the axle. So we put a hydrogen container into this space. Along with a second container underneath the rear seats. This enables the car to hold more than 4kg of hydrogen, which leads to the driving range that I mentioned earlier.</P><BLOCKQUOTE name=""1398"" id=""1398"" class=""graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"">“A fuel cell can be refueled very quickly, in three minutes, and has a long range of around 500km or 600km. And there’s also the possibility to apply a fuel cell to a broad range of vehicles including buses, trucks and delivery vans.”</BLOCKQUOTE><P name=""6b37"" id=""6b37"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote"">Another challenge was to insure sufficient fuel cell durability and robustness, while also decreasing costs. For example, we reduced the amount of platinum by 90%, which provides a significant cost reduction. Our fuel cell is not much above the platinum loading of a catalytic converter on a conventional car.</P><FIGURE name=""e448"" id=""e448"" class=""graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p""><FIGCAPTION class=""imageCaption"">The Mercedes-Benz fuel cell system, © Daimler AG</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H4 name=""31da"" id=""31da"" class=""graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--h4-strong"">Was it very difficult to achieve the reduction in fuel cell size?</STRONG></H4><P name=""9ef6"" id=""9ef6"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--h4"">Yes, there were significant challenges. We needed to design a sufficient active area into a very restrictive packaging space. This was an issue on the level of electrochemical activity, and also on the mechanical engineering side. We had to find a way to package such a cell into an integrated frame that also satisfied the crash requirements. The successful achievement of this objective depended on a very close collaboration between our vehicle colleagues and fuel cell powertrain engineers.</P><H4 name=""111e"" id=""111e"" class=""graf graf--h4 graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--h4-strong"">Who do you think will be buying this car?</STRONG></H4><P name=""2c04"" id=""2c04"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--h4"">We aim to sell our car in all areas where there is sufficient hydrogen infrastructure. The prerequisite is the presence of refueling stations within acceptable reach.</P><P name=""b9b2"" id=""b9b2"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Three areas come to mind as having sufficient infrastructure at this point in time. One is Germany, our home market, where we’ve set up a joint venture, H2 Mobility, to build up and implement the hydrogen infrastructure, which is supported by the German federal government. And then there’s California, which has always been very active in this area. The state aims to have 500 hydrogen stations installed by 2022, which again involves a joint effort between car manufacturers, energy companies and the state government. The third region, where we already have more than 80 hydrogen stations, is Japan.</P><P name=""8012"" id=""8012"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">There are also many other countries where the hydrogen infrastructure is expanding rapidly, for example in the UK, France and some Scandinavian countries, but it takes time to build a network that provides the required coverage.</P><H4 name=""0c78"" id=""0c78"" class=""graf graf--h4 graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--h4-strong"">Why are Germany, California and Japan so advanced in terms of hydrogen infrastructure?</STRONG></H4><P name=""956a"" id=""956a"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--h4"">California has been very active in alternative drivetrains for many decades. It has very strict regulations regarding tailpipe emissions. For example, the state has implemented the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate, which requires large volume car manufacturers to sell a minimum number of zero emission vehicles. And there are only two options: battery electric and fuel cell vehicles. Both have specific application areas. A fuel cell can be refueled very quickly, in three minutes, and has a long range of around 500km or 600km. And there’s also the possibility to apply a fuel cell to a broad range of vehicles including buses, trucks and delivery vans. For these reasons California has been working for more than two decades to support this technology.</P><P name=""c323"" id=""c323"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Similarly, in Japan, there is a close collaboration between government and car companies to support the development of hydrogen infrastructure. Japan also has one of the most dense electric charging infrastructure networks. The country has adopted a very systematic approach: it now has sufficient charging stations, so it is gradually switching government support from charging to hydrogen, because this will be the next generation technology.</P><P name=""9225"" id=""9225"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">In Germany we have the Clean Energy Partnership, which aims to tackle <mark>climate change</mark> by supporting the development of emission-free mobility. This is a joint initiative, established in 2002, involving car companies, infrastructure companies and government authorities. In the first phase, Linde and Daimler aimed to build 20 stations, and then six companies got together in a joint venture — Shell, OMV, Air Liquide, Linde, Total and Daimler — with the goal of building 400 stations by 2023.</P><P name=""5c1a"" id=""5c1a"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"">Other car companies such as Toyota, Honda and BMW have joined this initiative as associated partners, creating a very broad basis for this activity. This is essential because it will take some time to build up the hydrogen network, and for the first few years this infrastructure network will not lead directly to any earnings.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION name=""ca71"" class=""section section--body section--last""><DIV class=""section-content""><DIV class=""section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn""><P name=""e61b"" id=""e61b"" class=""graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing""><EM class=""markup--em markup--p-em"">This is the first part of two.

Yates</A></SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class=""entry-content""><P>Last month, in <I><mark>Daimler AG</mark> v. Bauman,</I><SUP>1</SUP> the United States Supreme Court issued its second decision in three years on “general” personal jurisdiction over corporations – that is, the power of courts to make binding decisions on corporate defendants in litigation arising outside the forum state.<SUP>2</SUP></P><P>In its 2011 decision, <I>Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown,</I> the Court held that a corporate defendant is subject to general jurisdiction in the states where it is “essentially at home,” “paradigm” examples being its states of incorporation and principal place of business.<SUP>3</SUP>  These are the corporate equivalents of a natural person’s domicile, and domicile establishes “presence” in the state.  A state’s power to assert jurisdiction over any person “present” within its territory has never been doubted.<SUP>4</SUP></P><P>Many states have also allowed their courts to assert general jurisdiction over foreign corporations who are engaged in a “substantial, continuous, and systematic course of business” in the state.  This is sometimes called “doing business” in the state, and courts have exercised general jurisdiction under the “doing business” standard particularly if the defendant foreign corporation has offices, bank accounts, property, employees, or agents in the forum state.<SUP>5</SUP> In contrast, a defendant who occasionally “transacts business” in the state may be subject to specific jurisdiction if the litigation arises out of those transactions, but will not be subject to general jurisdiction based on such contacts alone.<SUP>6</SUP></P><P><I>Goodyear</I> implied that the “doing business” standard is wrong.  <I>Daimler </I>confirms that it is wrong.  “Doing business” is not enough by itself to establish the constructive presence required for general jurisdiction.  Rather, the defendant must be “at home” in the forum state.  As noted above, “paradigm all-purpose forums” include a corporation’s state of incorporation and principal place of business.  These states also “have the virtue of being unique – that is, each ordinarily indicates only one place – as well as easily ascertainable,” simultaneously assuring potential plaintiffs they will have “recourse to at least one clear and certain forum in which a corporate defendant may be sued on any and all claims.”</P><P>The <I>Daimler </I>court allowed that a corporate defendant objecting to jurisdiction may be deemed “at home” in some other states, but the only example the Supreme Court has upheld to date is found in the 1952 decision of <I>Perkins v. Benguet Consolidated Mining Co.</I><SUP>7</SUP><I>  </I>In <I>Perkins, </I>the courts of Ohio were authorized to exercise general jurisdiction over a Philippine mining corporation that “carried on…a continuous and systematic supervision of the [company’s] necessarily limited wartime activities” in Ohio – the company president’s home state – during the Second World War, after Philippine mining operations ceased when Japan occupied the Philippines.  Upholding general jurisdiction in a state where a defendant is based, although only temporarily, hardly expands the “paradigm forum” list.</P><P>In <I>Daimler, </I>the plaintiffs alleged that they or their relatives, all workers and alleged trade union activists at Mercedes Benz Argentina,<SUP>8</SUP> a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Daimler, had been kidnapped, tortured, and sometimes killed by government security forces during the “Dirty War” of 1976-83.  They further alleged that Mercedes Benz Argentina had collaborated with the government forces in these violations.</P><P>All of the plaintiffs resided in Argentina and all but one were citizens of Argentina.  The underlying events had no connection with California, or indeed the United States.  The Argentine plaintiffs nonetheless elected to sue the German parent in California.</P><P>Also named as a defendant was Daimler’s indirect U.S. subsidiary, Mercedes Benz USA (“MBUSA”).  MBUSA purchases cars from Daimler and imports them into the United States, where a network of independent dealers sells them throughout the country.  MBUSA is based in New Jersey but has offices and a substantial presence in California.  It did not dispute that it was subject to general jurisdiction there.  (Whether it was or not may be an open question – lack of jurisdiction is a waivable defense and the Court mentioned the waiver, not that the subsidiary was “at home” in California,” in its description of the relevant facts.)</P><P>Daimler disputed jurisdiction, and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California agreed and granted its motion to dismiss.  The plaintiffs appealed.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals initially affirmed but changed its mind on reconsideration<SUP>9</SUP> and reversed<SUP>10</SUP>.  The deciding factor was the parent’s admission, in answer to a hypothetical, that it would be willing to perform MBUSA’s work in California if the subsidiary did not exist.  The companies were not deemed alter egos (the plaintiffs raised the issue belatedly and thereby waived it, although we can expect allegations of “unitary” businesses in the future), but the parent was deemed “present” in California through its “agent” subsidiary.<SUP>11</SUP></P><P><I>Goodyear </I>was issued a month later, and Daimler moved for reconsideration.  Its motion was denied, with eight justices dissenting.<SUP>12</SUP></P><P>The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed because, under the <I>Goodyear </I>standard, Daimler was not “at home” in California.</P><P>The Court reasoned, in part, that Daimler could not be “at home” in every state where its cars were sold, and general jurisdiction</P><P>instead calls for an appraisal of a corporation’s activities in their entirety, nationwide and worldwide.  A corporation that operates in many places can scarcely be deemed at home in all of them.  Otherwise, “at home” would be synonymous with “doing business” tests framed before specific jurisdiction evolved in the United States.<SUP>13</SUP></P><P>Furthermore, “[s]uch exorbitant exercises of all-purpose jurisdiction would scarcely permit out-of-state defendants ‘to structure their primary conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit.’”<SUP>14</SUP><I>  </I>These considerations are consistent with the rationale noted above that a forum suitable for general jurisdiction must be “unique.”</P><P>Justice Ginsburg, author of the <I>Goodyear </I>opinion, also wrote the majority opinion in <I>Daimler.  </I>The <I>Goodyear </I>decision was unanimous, and all nine justices likewise agreed with the result in <I>Daimler.</I></P><P>Justice Sotomayor, however, concurred only in the judgment and issued a separate opinion.  She agreed the exercise of jurisdiction over Daimler would be unreasonable “in light of the unique circumstances of this case” but seemed taken aback at the majority’s casual rejection of the “doing business” standard.<SUP>15</SUP>  She also disagreed with the majority’s conclusion that a defendant’s contacts with the forum state should be considered in proportion to its operations elsewhere, a concept she disapprovingly called “too big for general jurisdiction.”<SUP>16</SUP></P><P>Prior to <I>Daimler </I>and <I>Goodyear, </I>the Supreme Court had issued only two decisions on general jurisdiction since 1945, when it overturned strict territorial requirements for jurisdiction in the seminal decision of <I>International Shoe Co. v. Washington.</I><SUP>17</SUP><I>  </I>The Court now has issued as many decisions on general jurisdiction in the past three years as it did in the sixty-six years before them.  These cases mark a major restriction on existing standards and more decisions on general jurisdiction can be expected to follow.</P><P><SUP>1</SUP> <I><mark>Daimler AG</mark> v. Bauman,</I> 571 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 746 (Jan. 14, 2014).</P><P><SUP>2</SUP> “Specific” personal jurisdiction, also known as “long-arm” jurisdiction, refers to jurisdiction over foreign defendants – “foreign” meaning a non-resident, whether residing in another state or another country – in litigation arising out of contacts with the forum state.</P><P>“Specific” jurisdiction is “unquestionably” proper “where the corporation’s in-state activity is ‘continuous and systematic’ and that activity gave rise to the episode-in-suit.”  <I>Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, </I>564 U. S. ___, 131 S. Ct. 2846, 2853 (2011), quoting<I> International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </I>326 U.S. 310, 317 (1945).  Occasional, even single, contacts with the forum can support “specific” jurisdiction, depending on their nature, quality, and circumstances.</P><P>The U.S. Supreme Court has addressed the scope of this second type of specific jurisdiction many times since 1945, when it first upheld “long-arm” jurisdiction in <I>International Shoe</I>.  <I>See, e.g., Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court, </I>480 U.S. 102 (1987); <I>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, </I>471 U.S. 462 (1985); <I>Calder v. Jones, </I>465 U.S. 783 (1984); <I>Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.</I>, 465 U.S. 770 (1984); <I>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson</I>, 444 U.S. 286 (1980); <I>Shaffer v. Heitner, </I>433 U.S. 186 (1977); and, <I>McGee v. International Life Ins. Co.</I>, 355 U.S. 220 (1957).</P><P>During the same period, it addressed “general” jurisdiction only twice: in <I>Perkins v. Benguet Consolidated Mining Co.,</I> 342 U.S. 437 (1952),which upheld it, and <I>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall</I> 466 U. S. 408, 415-16 (1984), which did not.  <I>See </I>main text at note 6 and note 17 below.</P><P><SUP>3</SUP> 131 S. Ct. at 2853-54.  Our Client Bulletin of July 1, 2011 covered this decision.  Briefly, the North Carolina Court of Appeals had upheld jurisdiction over three European tire manufacturers, all subsidiaries of a U.S. corporation licensed to do business in North Carolina, in connection with a bus accident in France that resulted in the deaths of two North Carolina boys.  The North Carolina high court concluded that the subsidiaries, some of whose tires were sold in North Carolina, had “purposefully availed themselves of the protection” of North Carolina laws by “purposefully inject[ing their] product into the stream of commerce,” through their parent’s “highly organized distribution process,” without “limit[ing] the area of distribution of [their] product so as to exclude North Carolina.”  The U.S. Supreme Court reversed because “stream of commerce” analysis was only relevant to specific jurisdiction cases and the subsidiaries were not “at home” in North Carolina under the general jurisdiction test.  <I>Cf. J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro</I>, 564 U.S. ___, 131 S. Ct. 2780 (2011) (also covered in our July 2011 Client Bulletin); <I>Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court</I>, 480 U.S. 102 (1987) (plurality opinion on “stream of commerce” specific jurisdiction in product liability case).</P><P><SUP>4</SUP><I>See Burnham v. Superior Court</I>, 495 U.S. 604(1990) (plurality opinion on transient jurisdiction based on service of process during defendant’s temporary presence in state); <I>Pennoyer v. Neff, </I>95 U.S. 714 (1878) (adopting strict territorial approach to jurisdiction subsequently overruled in <I>International Shoe</I>).  The defendant’s presence, however, must be voluntary.  <I>See, e.g., Wyman v. Newhouse, </I>93 F.2d 313 (2d Cir. 1937); <I>Tickle v. Barton</I>, 95 S.E.2d 427 (W. Va. 1956) (no jurisdiction over defendants who were served with process within territory of forum state but only after being induced to visit under false pretenses).</P><P><SUP>5</SUP><I>See, e.g., Wiwa v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, Co.</I>, 226 F.3d 88, 96 (2d Cir. 2000); <I>see also JetBlue Airways Corp. v. Helferich Patent Licensing, LLC, ___ </I>F. Supp. 2d ___, 2013 WL 713929 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (a patent case, but the jurisdictional analysis referred to leading New York cases); <I>Frummer v. Hilton Hotels Int’l, Inc.,</I> 19 N.Y.2d 533, 536-38 (1967) (general jurisdiction allowed over a London hotel in connection with a slip and fall incident there because the hotel engaged in public relations and publicity work in New York, accepted reservations through a New York office, and maintained a bank account and telephone number in New York in order to liaise with travel agents throughout the United States).</P><P>Some courts got it right prior to <I>Goodyear</I>.  For example, in <I>Follette v. Clairol, Inc.,</I> 829 F. Supp. 840, 845 (W.D. La.), <I>aff’d, </I>998 F.2d 1014 (5th Cir. 1993) (Table), the defendant was not subject to general jurisdiction in Texas because it did not reside there.  The plaintiff resided and sustained injury in Louisiana but commenced suit after the Louisiana prescription period had expired.  She therefore sued in Texas, which had a longer limitation period, and had the action transferred to Louisiana.  A Magistrate Judge in Louisiana concluded that the defendant was not subject to general jurisdiction in Texas because it was not incorporated or based there and commencement of suit there was a nullity.  The district court adopted the Magistrate’s recommendations and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, but without opinion.</P><P><SUP>6</SUP> State and federal law may both be relevant in determining jurisdiction.  If the state has a “long-arm” statute, a court will first consider whether the statute authorizes jurisdiction in the particular case.  The court will then consider whether the exercise of jurisdiction comports with due process standards under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  Many states have empowered their courts to assert jurisdiction to the limits of due process, and in these states the once prevalent two-step inquiry has merged into a single due process analysis.</P><P><SUP>7</SUP> 342 U.S. 437 (1952).</P><P><SUP>8</SUP>  The names of the defendant and its subsidiaries have changed over the years and indeed over the course of the litigation.  For purposes of this Newsletter, we refer to the German parent as “Daimler” and the subsidiaries “Mercedes Benz Argentina” and “Mercedes Benz USA”.</P><P><SUP>9</SUP><I>Bauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp.</I>, 579 F.3d 1088 (9th Cir. 2009), <I>vacated</I>, 603 F.3d 1141 (9th Cir. 2010).</P><P><SUP>10</SUP><I>Bauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 644 F.3d 909, 911-12 (9th Cir. 2011), rev’d, 571 U.S. ___, 134 S. Ct. 746 (2014).</I></P><P><SUP>11</SUP> Under California law, corporations, even parents and subsidiaries, are considered separate persons.  However, if one company – typically the subsidiary – is a “mere instrumentality” or “alter ego” of another (such as a parent), then the companies will have such a unity of interest and ownership that their purported “separateness” will be disregarded.  In <I>Daimler, </I>the plaintiffs did not allege, and all apparently agreed they would not be able to prove, that MBUSA and Daimler were alter egos or a single (“unitary”) corporation.  But, under a second test – the “agency test” – the contacts of a subsidiary may be imputed to its parent if: (1) the subsidiary performs tasks that, if it did not exist, the parent would have to perform itself; and (2) the parent controls the subsidiary’s internal affairs or daily operations.   On reconsideration, the Ninth Circuit modified the second prong and found agency based on what it considered Daimler’s “substantial control” of MBUSA.  The Supreme Court noted that not even the plaintiffs tried to defend this portion of the Ninth Circuit’s decision.</P><P><SUP>12</SUP> The Ninth Circuit opinion was issued on May 18 and the <I>Goodyear </I>decision on June 27, 2011.</P><P><SUP>13</SUP><I>Daimler, </I>134 S. Ct. at 761 n. 20.</P><P><SUP>14</SUP><I>Id.</I> at 761-62, quoting <I>Burger King v. Rudzewicz, </I>471 U.S. at 472.</P><P><SUP>15</SUP> Justice Sotomayor believed Germany was the proper forum for the dispute.  Traditional due process analysis, in addition to requiring “minimum contacts” or systematically “doing business,” also precluded jurisdiction in a forum that is “unreasonable,” taking into consideration comity principles, convenience, and any undue burdens on the court.  These factors are also considered in relation to venue – that is, the right and sometimes statutory obligation of a court that has jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter to decline to exercise jurisdiction, on condition that the defendant agree to appear in another forum.  Under the “doing business” standard, courts could uphold jurisdiction under due process standards of “reasonableness” but decline to exercise jurisdiction on grounds of <I>forum non conveniens.  </I>Under <I>Goodyear/Daimler, </I>such dismissals may no longer be a matter of discretion – if the defendant is not “at home,” the claims must be dismissed.</P><P>Justice Sotomayor also believed the majority went beyond the scope of d certiorari.  She thought the issue before the Court was whether an indirect subsidiary’s acts could always be imputed to its parent.</P><P><SUP>16</SUP> The majority decision repeatedly linked the “at home” standard to the seminal 1945 “specific” jurisdiction case of <I>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </I>326 U.S. 310 (1945), which departed from a “strict territorial” standard that states may only assert jurisdiction over persons within the state adopted in <I>Pennoyer v. Neff, </I>95 U.S. 714, 720 (1878),and in its two pre-<I>Goodyear </I>decisions on “general” jurisdiction, discussed in the main text at note 6 and in note 17 below.</P><P>None of these cases use the words “at home,” and most courts did not seem aware of this “bright-line” standard prior to <I>Goodyear</I>.  (<I>JetBlue, </I>see note 4 above, suggests that some did not fully appreciate it even afterwards.)  The “at home” standard was primarily derived from a couple of older law review articles.</P><P><SUP>17</SUP> These were the <I>Perkins </I>decision, <I>see </I>main text at note 6, and<I> Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall</I> 466 U. S. 408, 415-16 (1984), in which Texas courts were not allowed to exercise jurisdiction over a Colombian helicopter operator in wrongful death actions arising out of a crash in Peru, although the defendant had purchased $4 million worth of helicopters, spare parts, and accessories in Texas, accepted delivery of aircraft in Texas, sent its pilots to Texas for training and management and maintenance personnel to Texas for “plant familiarization,” and received $5 million in revenue from the decedents’ employer, who was based in Texas and paid defendant from a Texas bank.  The Court concluded this was insufficient for “general jurisdiction,” under the less-than-lucid standard of “whether [the defendant’s contacts with Texas] constitute the kind of continuous and systematic general business contacts the Court found to exist in <I>Perkins.”</I></P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

A study led by the Basque Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> on the 120 largest cities in the world warns of the fate that will run large cities such as New Orleans, Canton, Shanghai, Boston and New York. <TABLE width=""508"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0""><TBODY><TR><TD class=""txtgr10""><A href=""articulos_envia.asp?idarticulo=5179"" class=""txtgr10"">Send to a friend</A></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><FONT style=""font-family: Arial, Verdana , Helvetica, sans-serif;; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;text-align: left;"" id=""Contenido""><P>The impact of <mark>climate change</mark> is already evident and will continue to be so even if the mitigation policies against global warming are successful. For this reason, scientists need to estimate the danger that the largest coastal cities around the world will face as a result of rising sea levels.</P><P>Researchers at the Basque Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> have analyzed the risks that will affect 120 megacities on four different continents as the century progresses. To do this, they calibrated the rise in sea level for each city and scenario, using a Brownian geometric model that generates probability distributions over time.</P><P>&quot;There is an increasingly urgent need to invest in adaptation measures of some coastal cities in the face of future sea level rises as a consequence of <mark>climate change</mark>. This type of investment usually requires long periods of time for its realization,&quot; says Luis María Abadie, author of the study at the Basque Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark>, to Sinc.</P><P>Experts consider this investment fundamental in the context of global uncertainty that affects the planet, both because of the local effects of <mark>climate change</mark> and because of the socioeconomic development of different populations in the future.</P><P>&quot;There is an increasingly urgent need to invest in adaptation measures of some coastal cities in the face of future sea level rises as a consequence of <mark>climate change</mark>&quot;</P><P>&quot;The risk increases rapidly over time and in some cities may reach unacceptable levels in a few decades,&quot; adds the scientist. The study also explains that if adaptation investments do not become effective soon, many areas could experience population migrations and abandonment.</P><P>Among the most affected cities for the huge losses expected are large Chinese and American coastal cities. According to calculations for 2050, the most affected in China will be the cities of Canton, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenzhen, Zhanjiang and Xiamen. In the US, it will be New Orleans, Boston, New York, Miami and Houston, in that order. These losses are a consequence of extreme events whose impact grows due to the rise in sea level.</P><P>The study also analyzes the situation of several European cities such as Istanbul, Glasgow, Lisbon, London and Hamburg. &quot;In Europe the risks and expected damages are significantly lower,&quot; Abadie explains.</P><P><SPAN style=""color:#000080;""><STRONG>Invest according to risk in each city</STRONG></SPAN></P><P>&quot;The damages originate as a result of a rise in sea level, which is different for each city, and extreme events. To this it is added that in certain cities there is the possibility of subsidence, that is, the sinking of the land&quot;, explains the researcher.</P><P>The work offers a new method to calculate the damage and risk depending on the rise in sea level and the cost for each city. With this methodology, proposals are obtained to adapt the coastal areas and make decisions in the different possible scenarios. It can be useful, for example, to plan the expansion of a city and its new infrastructure.</P><P>&quot;The high risk levels in some cities will reach unacceptable values for politicians and stakeholders, so investment will be necessary. But this economic effort must be made well in advance&quot;, concludes the expert.</P></FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In this context, China is opting for electro-mobility, not least for reasons of industrial policy. When combined with increased electricity generation from renewables, electro-mobility offers a viable means of achieving <mark>sustainable</mark> urban mobility. However, there are still no corresponding fully developed strategies in place anywhere in the world. China and Germany have entered into a bilateral cooperation agreement under which the project is to explore the potential of electro-mobility for enhancing <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation and environmental protection.</P><H2>Objective</H2><P>Ministries and leading think tanks have strategies at their disposal for exploiting the potential of electro-mobility to promote <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation and environmental protection in China. To this end, development paths are in place to allow the technology to be disseminated as effectively as possible.</P><H2>Approach</H2><P>The project identifies and assesses the impact of electro-mobility on the <mark>climate</mark> in China and works with its partners to analyse different scenarios, involving leaders from politics, business and society in the process. The resulting scenarios describe options for penetrating the market with electric vehicles in a <mark>climate</mark>-friendly and environmentally sound way. They offer a quantitative description of the roll-out of renewable energies and the smart integration of electro-mobility in China. This provides the basis for policy recommendations on shaping the legal framework and implementing pilot and demonstration projects for integrating renewable energies and an efficient battery-charging infrastructure.</P><P>Joint studies and events serve to build the capacity of the Chinese partners to develop methodical and legal basic frameworks. Environmental regulation of China's transport sector is designed to prevent a rise in greenhouse-gas emissions through the increased use of electric vehicles.</P><P>A feasibility study will be conducted into for a nationwide battery-recycling system for electric vehicles in time for the project's completion. On this basis, policy recommendations will be made on designing pilot and demonstration projects for implementing such a system in China.</P><P>The project supports the sharing of information between China and Germany on fleet tests with supporting environmental research. The project is also developing guidelines for municipal administrations on how to promote electro-mobility in a <mark>climate</mark>-friendly way and integrate it into <mark>sustainable</mark> urban transport concepts. Project partners are using these guidelines for joint information and training events. The focus continues to be on the feasibility of concepts for electric-vehicle use. Modified behaviour such as car-sharing and car-pooling is to result in additional contributions towards <mark>climate</mark> and environmental protection.</P><H2>Results</H2><P>Key actors such as the China Automotive Technology and Research Centre (CATARC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) are working closely with the project. Awareness of electro-mobility and the opportunities it presents is increasing.</P><P>The corporate partnerships with the BMW Group, <mark>Daimler AG</mark>, Volkswagen Group China and Chang’an Auto have laid the foundation for companies on the Chinese market to view the project's results as guidelines for <mark>climate</mark>-friendly practices.</P><P>The Chinese partners are interested in using the participatory process of scenario analysis as an instrument for drafting policy recommendations. Working with Tsinghua University, the project produced a comprehensive assessment of the <mark>climate</mark> and environmental impact of electro-mobility in China up to 2030. In this assessment, the partners recommended that the Chinese electricity sector cease to rely on coal-fired power plants and that efforts be made to develop battery technology further. Another step in the project will involve analysing the contribution of electric vehicles to improving air quality, for instance in the city of Beijing.</P><P>With German assistance, China intends to integrate electric vehicles into its environmental and <mark>climate</mark> standards. To this end, the project partners are comparing and evaluating international regulations for promoting fuel efficiency in motor vehicles, the role of electric vehicles, and supplementary policy instruments for increasing vehicle fuel efficiency.</P><P>China and Germany are working together on the supporting academic research and in the area of smart, multi-modal mobility concepts and <mark>sustainable</mark> urban transport systems. Guidelines have been developed in cooperation with Tongji University, showing municipalities how they can integrate electro-mobility into a comprehensive package of <mark>climate</mark>-friendly, environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark> urban transport measures. Promising pilot projects for (electric-) car sharing have also been launched in China.</P></DIV></DIV><ASIDE class=""offset-md-1 col-md-2 col-xs-12 desk-top""><SECTION dir=""ltr""><H4>Contact</H4></SECTION></ASIDE></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

This is the main conclusion  drawn by the report “Tackling <mark>climate change</mark> through livestock”. This newly  released report provides the most comprehensive global assessment made to-date of  the livestock sector’s GHG emissions and its mitigation potential. </P><P>        The report also presents   a detailed assessment  of the magnitude,  the sources and pathways of emissions from different production systems and  supply chains. Relying on life cycle assessment, statistical analysis and  scenario building, it identifies concrete options to reduce emissions. </P><P>        It comes at a time when the world needs to urgently reduce GHG emissions to  avert catastrophic <mark>climate change</mark>. The livestock sector can make an important contribution to such international efforts by offsetting some of the sector’s emission increases, which are expected as demand for livestock products is projected to grow by 70 percent by 2050.</P><H3><STRONG>Key messages</STRONG></H3><H4><STRONG>Important GHG  emissions </STRONG></H4><UL><LI>The livestock sector plays an important role in <mark>climate change</mark>. It is estimated  to emit 7.1 gigatonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide equivalent (CO<SUB>2</SUB>-eq) per  annum, representing 14.5 percent of all human-induced emissions.</LI><LI>Beef and cattle milk production account for the majority of emissions, respectively contributing 41 and 19 percent of the sector’s emissions. While pig meat and poultry meat and eggs contribute respectively 9 percent and 8 percent to the sector's emissions. </LI><LI>The main sources of emissions are: feed production and processing (45  percent of the total – with 9 percent attributable to the expansion of pasture  and feed crops into forests), enteric fermentation from ruminants (39 percent),  and manure decomposition (10 percent). The remainder is attributable to the  processing and transportation of animal products. </LI></UL><H4><STRONG>Sizeable  reductions within reach</STRONG></H4><UL><LI>Sector emissions could already be brought down significantly just through  the wider use of existing best practices and technologies. Technologies and practices that contribute to reducing emissions already exist, but could be used more widely.</LI></UL><UL><LI>A 30 percent reduction of GHG emissions would be possible if producers in a  given system, region and climatic zone adopted the technologies and practices  currently used by their least emission intensive (emissions per unit of animal  product) peers.      </LI></UL><UL><LI>Substantial emission  reductions can be achieved across all species, systems and regions.      </LI></UL><H4><STRONG>Efficiency key to reducing emissions</STRONG></H4><UL><LI>Possible interventions to reduce emissions are mainly based on technologies  and practices that improve production efficiency at animal and herd levels.  They include better feeding practices, animal husbandry and health management.  </LI></UL><UL><LI>Manure management practices that ensure the recovery and recycling of  nutrients and energy contained in manure, and energy savings and recycling  along supply chains, are further mitigation options.      </LI></UL><H4><STRONG>Mitigation for  development</STRONG></H4><UL><LI>Most mitigation interventions can provide both environmental and  economic co-benefits. Efficient practices and technologies can boost productivity  and thus contribute to food security and poverty alleviation. </LI></UL><H4><STRONG>Urgent need  for collective and global action</STRONG></H4><UL><LI>Global action involving all sector stakeholders is urgently required to  design and implement cost-effective and equitable mitigation strategies, and to  set up the necessary supporting policies and institutional frameworks. </LI></UL><UL><LI>The adoption of new practices and technologies will require a mix of  supporting policies, incentives, research and on-the-ground extension work. </LI></UL><P>This report is  complemented by two technical reports providing a more in-depth analysis of  emissions by sub-sectors (pig and chicken supply chains and ruminant supply  chains). </P><H3><STRONG>FAO’s commitment to practice improvements and  sector sustainability</STRONG></H3><P>        FAO is actively  involved in the Agenda of Action in support of <mark>Sustainable</mark> Livestock Sector Development,  a global multi-stakeholder partnership dedicated to improving practices for a  more efficient use of natural resources. It focuses on three areas:  practices efficiency, grassland management and  manure management.  </P><P>        FAO is also actively  involved in the Livestock Environment Assessment and Performance (LEAP)  Partnership, a cross-sectoral effort to develop common metrics to define and  measure environmental performance of livestock supply chains.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

For good reason: heavy- and medium-duty trucks, which include everything from ambulances and garbage trucks to cement mixers and semis, make up nearly a quarter of all US greenhouse-gas emissions from transportation, according to the US transportation department.</P><P>Put another way, these trucks add 1.6bn metric tons of <mark>CO2</mark> equivalent emissions into the atmosphere annually, accounting for 5.75% of emissions globally, according to a <A href=""http://<mark>carbon</mark>warroom.com/sites/default/files/reports/Unlocking%20Fuel%20Saving%20Technologies%20in%20Trucking%20and%20Fleets%20(<mark>Carbon</mark>%20War%20Room).pdf"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">2012 <mark>Carbon</mark> War Room report</A> (pdf).

The rules require some of the heavy-duty vehicles to improve fuel efficiency 23% by 2018, and call for up to a 20% reduction in <mark>CO2</mark> emissions from 2010 baselines by 2017.

With a sleek, extended tractor front and an array of LED lights that replace traditional headlights, Daimler claims its Future Truck 2025 could be the next generation in trucking – and could reduce fuel consumption and related emissions while improving safety.</P><P>The big rig bristles with communications technology: it navigates using its Highway Pilot system, enabled by a collection of cameras and radar sensors, while continuously transmitting its position to other drivers and traffic control centers. For times when it has a driver behind the wheel, the truck also has a Blind Spot Assist feature to help with lane changing and to alert drivers about other vehicles and stationary objects on the road. </P><P>From a technology standpoint, anyway, driverless trucks may not be far off: many <A href=""http://www.automobilemag.com/features/lists/1401-top-ten-cars-with-active-safety-features/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">cars on the road today</A> already have collision and lane-changing assistance, and manufacturers are increasingly installing collision-avoidance systems to help stabilize trucks when they are at risk of rolling over – and to warn drivers when they are drifting out of their lanes.</P><P>For trucks already on the road, manufacturers are working to reduce idling time, which can eat up half a truck’s operational time and 8% of its fuel. Drivers often leave their truck engines idling in order to heat or cool their vehicles while they sleep, but some new engines automatically shut down when the weather isn’t hot or cold enough to warrant running the heating or air conditioning.</P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-4 | 2""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">How Georgia became the biggest electric vehicle market in the US</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

A demonstration truck from <A href=""http://http://www.peterbilt.com/about/media/2014/396/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Peterbuilt Motors</A> has reached 10.7 mpg.</P><P>The Evolution line itself has evolved its efficiency features from 2007, when it first arrived on the scene. In 2014, it added what’s called “automated manual transmissions” to all of its trucks. </P><P>Unlike fully automatic transmissions, which use hydraulic pressure – and a torque converter – to change gears, automated manual transmissions transmit power through metal gears, which makes them more fuel efficient. </P><P>These transmissions, which – like automatic transmissions – take the responsibility for shifting gears away from drivers, are more expensive, but can <A href=""http://www.truckinginfo.com/article/story/2012/05/automated-mechanical-transmissions-gaining-steadily-in-class-8-trucks.aspx%5D"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">vastly increase efficiency</A>. TJ Reed, Freightliner’s director of product strategy, said that their widespread use has been a game changer for the company.</P><P>“We were fully ramped up in 2014 and it’s really amazing. The market is significantly switching from manuals,” Reed told the Guardian. “The concept of running at a lower RPM, that’s going to be a key driver of fuel economy in the future and the automated manual transmission is a technology that enables that.”</P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-4 | 3""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">Shared shipping is slowly gaining ground between market rivals</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

This sort of attention has led not only to better fuel economy and savings, but also to fewer collisions, Horn said.</P><P>These advances – particularly increased automation – could result in a major improvement in road safety. Sleepy truck drivers, bad brakes and the sheer size of tractor trailers contribute to <A href=""http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/large-trucks/fatalityfacts/large-trucks"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">thousands of deaths per year</A> – 3,602 in 2013 – from truck crashes on US roadways, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. </P><P>That’s down from 3,992 deaths in truck-related crashes in 1997 and more than 4,000 in 1979. According to Eric Teoh, a senior statistician at the IIHS, some of that reduction may be due to the growing use of speed limiting devices, which, he said, may become federally mandated in the near future.</P><P>“We haven’t studied [speed limiters] directly, but we know that as speed goes up so do the risk of crashing and the severity of crashes,” he said.

The zone is based on the *average *lowest temperature range a particular area reaches. This doesn't necessarily mean it's the coldest it's ever been. Unlike past maps that used average minimum temperatures from the past 13 years, this time the map is averaging the past 30 years.

However, some of the changes in the zones are the results of… more sophisticated mapping methods…which has greatly improved accuracy”.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""paywall"">Another thing to keep in mind.

The battery pack is the most expensive part of a plug-in, making up about a third of the total cost. Lithium-ion packs are projected to be 43 percent cheaper by 2021, dropping to $156 a kilowatt-hour from $273 today.</P><P>To be sure, the wider use of lithium-ion batteries is still in its early days and there are potentially <A itemscope=""itemscope"" itemprop=""StoryLink"" href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-14/google-ceo-schmidt-flags-promise-of-new-goodenough-battery"" title=""Google’s Schmidt Flags Promise in New Goodenough Battery (2)"" target=""_blank"">competing technologies</A>.

</DIV></DIV><P dir=""ltr""><STRONG>The European Central Bank’s programme of ‘quantitative easing’ has seen over €46 billion of public funds invested in sectors including the oil, gas and car industries.</STRONG></P><P dir=""ltr"">A <A href=""https://corporateeurope.org/economy-finance/2016/12/ecb-quantitative-easing-funds-multinationals-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">short report</A> published by Corporate Europe Observatory this week highlights the dubious nature of many corporate bonds bought since the bank’s economic growth scheme was launched in June 2016.</P><P dir=""ltr"">As soon as it started, we as QE for People campaign have been <A href=""http://www.qe4people.eu/corporate_qe_ecb_multinationals"">actively criticizing</A> this section of the ECB’s QE programme. We warned against this unnecessary move that could potentially jeopardize further more the ECB’s reputation, especially at times when euroscepticism is on the rise. In that sense, <A href=""http://www.qe4people.eu/bayer_monsanto_merger_facilitated_ecb"">the case of Bayer</A> is particularly revealing.</P><P dir=""ltr"">The report &quot;<A href=""https://corporateeurope.org/economy-finance/2016/12/ecb-quantitative-easing-funds-multinationals-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">ECB funds multinationals and <mark>climate</mark></A>&quot; confirms our concerns. It provides the first ever analysis of these bond purchases that looks at the full list of companies benefiting from the scheme coordinated by the European Central Bank (ECB) and executed by the central banks of France, Germany, Finland, Spain, Italy and Belgium. The ECB makes it difficult to trace its links to companies, not publishing any information other than the so-called International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) of purchased bonds.</P><P dir=""ltr"">Decoding the ISINs, Corporate Europe Observatory was nevertheless able to reveal the types of companies propped up by ECB bond purchases. The distinct investment pattern that emerged points to a complete lack of consideration for the sensible use of public funds.</P><P dir=""ltr"">A big share of bonds acquired for the ECB by national central banks belong to actors in the oil, gas and car industries. Investments in the arms industry, a gambling corporation and companies driving the privatisation of water also raise eyebrows.</P><P dir=""ltr"">In the context of individual EU member states, the following ECB bond acquisitions are particularly questionable:</P><P dir=""ltr""><STRONG>Banque de France</STRONG> purchases from water companies Veolia, Suez and Vivendi, as well as oil and gas companies Total and Air Liquide, car maker Renault, arms manufacturer Thales and luxury goods producer LVHM</P><P dir=""ltr""><STRONG>Banque Nationale de Belgique</STRONG> purchases from oil and gas companies Shell, Apetra, SPP, Nederlandse Gasunie and aerospace manufacturer Airbus</P><P dir=""ltr""><STRONG>Banco de España</STRONG> purchases from oil and gas companies Repsol, Gas Natural and Enagas</P><P dir=""ltr""><STRONG>Bundeszentralbank</STRONG> purchases from car makers Volkswagen, BMW and <mark>Daimler AG</mark></P><P dir=""ltr""><STRONG>Banca d’Italia</STRONG> purchases from oil and gas companies Eni and Snam</P><P dir=""ltr""><STRONG>Finlands Bank</STRONG> purchases from gambling corporation Novomatic, oil and gas companies OMV AG and Eesti Energia, as well as budget airline Ryanair</P><H3 dir=""ltr"">&quot;This investment pattern cannot be justified&quot;</H3><P dir=""ltr"">Corporate Europe Observatory’s financial policy researcher Kenneth Haar said:</P><P dir=""ltr"">&quot;The ECB is reluctant to provide information about the value of its bond purchases and even makes it difficult to find out which companies it buys into. As they use public funds to buy these bonds, the secrecy is dubious.”</P><P dir=""ltr"">&quot;When you look at the list of companies from which the ECB has bought bonds, you can certainly see a plausible motive for not revealing too much. Apparently the bank is quite content to support car producers, a gambling corporation, arms producers, and especially fossil fuel corporations that are driving <mark>climate change</mark>. Whichever way you look at it, this investment pattern cannot be justified.&quot;</P><P dir=""ltr"">“It would have made so much sense to use these billions of euros to create employment in environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark> sectors instead, but the status quo in European politics is still to put corporate profits before public interest.&quot;</P><H3 dir=""ltr"">Green MEPs call on the ECB to change course</H3><P dir=""ltr"">Following up on the report, Green Members of the European Parliament (Ernest Urtasun, Sven Giegold, Molly Scott-Cato and Reinhard Bütikofer) have sent a <A href=""http://www.qe4people.eu/green_meps_letter_urge_the_ecb_stop_financing_<mark>climate</mark>_change_multinationals"">joint open letter</A> to Mario Draghi calling upon the ECB to to integrate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria into the purchase programmes and consequently exclude and divest from <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive assets.”</P><P dir=""ltr"">The letter reads: “now that EU has ratified the Paris Agreement, we have a tremendous challenge to orderly de<mark>carbon</mark>ise our economy. At least 75% of fossil fuel reserves have to be kept in the ground to reach the 2° global warming limit agreed in Paris. We would like to formally request you to ensure the full alignment with EU environmental global commitments of the ECB’s current or, eventually future, private sector purchase programmes.”</P><P>Stanislas Jourdan from the <A href=""http://www.qe4people.eu/"">Quantitative Easing for People</A> initiative concludes:</P><P dir=""ltr"">&quot;The programme is economically unnecessary and ethically questionable. It does not benefit SMEs or the real economy, but instead subsidises large corporations which clearly do not need cheaper funding when rates are already so low.</P><P>“Ultimately it also damages the Bank's reputation and risks fuelling more populism against the EU. The Bank should therefore immediately stop its corporate bonds purchases.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

Schwarzenegger even went so far as to equate energy businesses to those tobacco companies that knew smoking causes cancer but chose to keep it a secret to protect their profits, even while millions died.</P><P>“This is no different from the smoking issue,” Schwarzenegger said. “The tobacco industry knew for years and years and years and decades, that smoking would kill people, would harm people and create cancer, and were hiding that fact from the people and denied it. Then eventually they were taken to court and had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars because of that.”</P><P>“Every gas station on it, every car should have a warning label on it, every product that has fossil fuels should have a warning label on it,” Schwarzenegger added.</P><P>Suggesting that the question of whether humans are causing global warming is settled — and, according to Schwarzenegger, has been settled for decades — is irresponsible. Many scientists from countries across the world are skeptical of the claim humans are to blame for global warming. Just two weeks ago, The Heartland Institute published a <A href=""https://www.heartland.org/_template-assets/documents/publications/022718_FINAL_Critique_of_<mark>Climate</mark>_Science_Special_Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Policy Brief</A> authored by a team of 18 distinguished scientists outlining just some of the reasons they believe <mark>climate</mark> scientists and government agencies claiming humans are causing <mark>climate change</mark> are wrong.</P><P>Among the paper’s contributors are John R. Christy, Ph.D., the distinguished professor of atmospheric science and director of the Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, and Roy Spencer, Ph.D., the principal research scientist at the University of Alabama at Huntsville. Christy and Spencer are former NASA <mark>climate</mark> researchers who received NASA’s Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal for their global temperature monitoring work with satellites.</P><P>John Coleman, who passed away earlier this year, also contributed to the paper. He was the founder of The Weather Channel and the original weathercaster on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”</P><P>Meteorologist Joseph D’Aleo is another of the paper’s contributors. He is the chief meteorologist at WeatherBell Analytics and the co-founder and first director of meteorology at the Weather Channel.</P><P>These scientists and countless others believe Schwarzenegger — who has spent the better part of his career competing in bodybuilding competitions and pretending to blow things up in Hollywood, not studying <mark>climate change</mark> — is dead wrong about global warming.</P><P>Schwarzenegger alleges that global warming is posing significant dangers, but the available evidence completely disproves this alarmist claim. For instance, contrary to popular belief, severe weather events are not becoming more common as a result of global warming. The amount and severity of hurricanes making landfall since the 1850s has remained <A href=""https://www.heartland.org/_template-assets/documents/publications/022718_FINAL_Critique_of_<mark>Climate</mark>_Science_Special_Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">relatively flat</A>, and prior to 2017, the United States hadn’t had a major hurricane make landfall in 12 years, the longest such drought since the 1860s.</P><P>Further, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports the number of floods and droughts has not increased because of <mark>climate change</mark>, and extensive <A href=""https://www.heartland.org/_template-assets/documents/policy-documents/Hedke%20Sea%20Level%20Rise%20Ten%20Cities.pdf"" target=""_blank"">research</A> by geophysicist Dennis Hedke shows “sea-level trends are not significantly different from what they were seven to nine decades ago.”</P><P>In fact, studies examining the effect cold weather has on populations have shown when <mark>climate</mark>s get colder, significantly more death and destruction results. Researchers published an article in 2015 in <A href=""https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/congress-is-key-to-reining-in-regulatory-excess"" target=""_blank"">The Lancet</A>, a prestigious academic journal, showing that an examination of 74 million deaths occurring in 13 different countries revealed cold weather is 1,700 percent deadlier than warm weather.</P><P>Schwarzenegger’s suggestion <mark>climate change</mark> is dangerous and thus that those energy companies that emit fossil fuels should be treated as though they are knowingly “killing” people isn’t only false, it’s a particularly dangerous and reckless assertion. Energy companies provide heat and electricity to billions of people around the world. They power industries and farms that feed families and animals. They make sure our hospitals are fully functioning and have helped civilization move, quite literally, out of darkness and into the light.</P><P>Punishing fossil-fuel companies probably makes a lot of sense to Schwarzenegger. He’s an environmental fanatic and multi-millionaire who doesn’t need to worry about the cost of electricity, food, or transportation. If he and other <mark>climate</mark> alarmists had it their way, <mark>carbon</mark> taxes and other anti-energy regulations would be imposed to drive traditional energy companies out of business. So-called “renewable” energy businesses would be propped up with taxpayers’ money. The result of these policies would be higher prices for virtually everything bought and sold, but especially gasoline, electricity, and heat. Who do you think will suffer more when that occurs: Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger or working-class Americans?</P><P>Scientists are debating numerous issues related to global warming. Let’s give them the time they need to determine the truth before hurling baseless accusations against vital businesses and creating policies that will destroy our economy and make life miserable for America’s poorest families.</P><P><EM>Justin Haskins (<A href=""mailto:Jhaskins@heartland.org"" target=""_blank"">Jhaskins@heartland.org</A>) is executive editor and a research fellow at The Heartland Institute.</EM></P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

The second-quarter results were overshadowed by the growing controversy over diesel technology hanging over the automaker — and the auto industry in general — ahead of a meeting in Germany of carmakers and government officials next week.
The Stuttgart-based company reported Wednesday that net profit was up a scant 2 percent compared with a year ago, to 2.51 billion euros ($2.9 billion). Revenue increased 7 percent to 41.16 billion euros ($48 billion).
The profit was short of analyst estimates for 2.61 billion as compiled by financial information provider FactSet. On the bright side, the Mercedes division had its best quarter for unit sales ever and 2.4 billion euros ($2.8 billion) in operating profit. Mercedes division profits were boosted by strong sales of the E-Class sedan, which is equipped with extensive driver assistance technology, and of the company's SUVs, which bring high profits per vehicle.
But operating earnings fell 13 percent in its truck business, and also lagged at the van and bus divisions.
The company reiterated that profits would ``increase significantly'' once again in 2017. Daimler shares traded 0.1 percent higher at 61.06 euros in Frankfurt.
The earnings announcement takes place amid extensive public discussion of the future of diesel and what to do about excessive <mark>pollution</mark> emissions. The government has summoned carmakers to a diesel summit on Aug. 2 to try to lower <mark>pollution</mark> levels and ensure the technology has a future. There have been calls for diesel bans in several German cities.</P><DIV class=""wsw__embed""><FIGURE class=""media-image js-media-expand""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">FILE - The exhaust system of a Volkswagen Passat TDI diesel car is seen in Esquibien, France, Sept. 23, 2015.</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><P>CEO Dieter Zetsche said during a conference call with journalists that the company's new generation of diesel engines offered lower emissions and that diesel can make an important contribution to reducing emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, a greenhouse gas blamed for global warming.</P><P>
He said he saw &quot;no reason to forego the advantages&quot; of diesel in reaching goals for lowering <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions. Automakers must meet new, tighter <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions limits imposed by the European Union by 2021.
Daimler has said it will update engine software on 3 million diesel cars to improve their emissions performance and reduce customer uncertainty about the technology. Zetsche said customers were responding positively to the service action.
Diesel vehicles need <mark>pollution</mark> controls to limit emissions of nitrogen oxide, a pollutant that harms people's health, but they emit less <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide than do gasoline motors.<EM>Der Spiegel</EM> reported Friday that German automakers including Daimler had colluded for years on diesel technology and other issues and had agreed to limit the size of the tanks for the urea solution used to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides. The European Commission, the EU's executive body, is assessing the matter. The company has said it cannot comment on &quot;speculation.&quot; An antitrust ruling that the companies illegally restrained competition could lead to heavy fines.
German prosecutors have searched Daimler offices as part of a probe into possible emissions manipulation, and U.S. authorities have asked Daimler to conduct an internal investigation into its emissions certification procedures. The company said Wednesday it could not answer questions about either investigation.</P><DIV class=""wsw__embed""><FIGURE class=""media-image js-media-expand""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">FILE - Volkswagen cars are presented to media inside a delivery tower prior to the company's annual press conference in Wolfburg, Germany, April 28, 2016.</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><P>Diesel was subjected to new scrutiny after Volkswagen was discovered in September 2015 to have equipped 11 million cars with illegal software that cheated on U.S. emissions tests by turning emissions controls on during lab examinations and off during every day driving to improve performance.

Major companies do not spend this kind of money because it is fruitless, obviously they see the long term outcome get into Electric Vehicles is the message.
Is it not a pity it has taken well over 100 years to come back to the original vehicles that were powered by batteries before ICE was introduced.

Yet, where leadership teams usually struggle is building a coherent strategy for their digital investments and then managing the implementation of these investments in ways that deliver expected business outcomes. In this masterclass, Prof. Peppard will share some of the key findings from the research he conducted for his latest book, The Strategic Management of Information Systems: Building a Digital Strategy (Wiley, 2016).<EM>Joe Peppard is a professor at ESMT. His research and teaching are in the area of information systems and technology, where he seeks to challenge dominant orthodoxies that contributing significantly to organizations’ inability to leverage digital technologies. He has published widely in academic and general business journals.</EM></P><P><STRONG>Digital changes and the individual: How culture changes context</STRONG>Annie FaulknerSome of the greatest impacts of digital technology and the speed of change have been on the lives of individuals. We can connect individuals across multiple borders, time zones, and interest groups at an ever-challenging pace. However, adopting technology on its own will not create <mark>innovation</mark>. Success is determined by the extent to which the individual embraces the technology and changes their knowledge sphere. New insights are emerging from neuroscience on how the brain functions during major periods of change. To operate in today’s workforce, the “corporate mind” must support the “individual mind” in order to manage increasing levels of speed, unpredictability, and complexity.This interactive session reveals the impact of digital change from a cultural perspective, in relation to changes in the workforce, and specifically in relation to prioritizing activities concerning skills development. Digital change is a key subject for debate and will be a critical item on the business agenda in the future.<EM>Annie Faulkner is a program director at ESMT. Her expertise includes business transformation, cross-culture coaching, employee engagement, and making sense of complexity. She completed her MSc in strategic focus at Edinburgh Business School and her MBA at CASS. Prior to joining ESMT, she was project director for Old Mutual.</EM></P><P><STRONG>Going digital, staying human</STRONG>Sebastian Fittko, Christoph Räthke, and Stefanie SchrammBehind closed doors, executives of large and Mittelstand corporations often voice frustration about their employees “not being ready to be more entrepreneurial or become part of digitization.” So how can they turn digitization from a concept understood by company leaders into a new way of working that is shared and supported by the people within the organization?After short introductory keynotes about concepts, best practice, and case studies, participants will have a chance to discuss the topic with – and get advice from – Stefanie Schramm (former program director of StartupInstitute), Sebastian Fittko (head of RWE <mark>Innovation</mark> Hub Berlin), and Christoph Räthke (GTEC director of education).  <EM>Christoph Räthke is the director of education at GTEC. He has been working in the digital industry since 1996. After stints at Deutsche Telekom and Berlin-based digital agencies, he began working as a consultant for the digital industry and founded the Berlin Startup Academy. At GTEC, he manages entrepreneurship education activities, lectures, and the workshops program.</EM></P><P><STRONG>HR goes digital</STRONG>Kristen Herde and Prof. Konstantin Korotov, PhDThis session, facilitated by Prof. Konstantin Korotov, director of ESMT’s Center for Leadership Development Research, features Kristen Herde, an ESMT Executive MBA alumna. Herde is a former global HR executive and founder of YeaHR! – an innovative consulting agency that supports HR in capturing a leading role in the digital transformation of companies. The session will offer an interactive discussion on what digitalization means for organizational HR practices and cultural change – from the way companies attract, onboard, develop, and retain talent to how leaders will lead and employees will collaborate in the future.<EM>Konstantin Korotov is an associate professor and the director of the Center for Leadership Development Research at ESMT. He researches and teaches worldwide in the areas of leadership development, leadership coaching, careers, and executive education. He has published multiple articles and books and is a practicing leadership coach specializing in challenging leadership development cases.Kristen Herde, CEO and founder of YeaHR! GmbH, brings in-depth HR know-how from areas such as employer branding, employee engagement, talent and performance management, change management, and recruiting. She has more than 10 years of international experience as a senior HR leader at E.ON and most recently served as the global HR director for E.ON <mark>Climate</mark> &amp; Renewables and VP of Diversity Management for E.ON. Herde holds an Executive MBA from ESMT, is a certified Executive Coach from Columbia University, and has worked as an HR consultant, executive coach, trainer, and high-impact facilitator partnering numerous international corporations over the past four years.</EM></P><P><STRONG>Working in virtual teams: pro et contra</STRONG>Andreas Bernhardt and Nora Grasselli, PhDAlthough virtual teams were a hot and controversial topic a couple of years back, they have since become a part of our everyday lives. We have all experienced working on products, projects, and services with our colleagues, collaborators, and clients at different locations and have generated a huge knowledge base about what works and what does not.This session aims at recollecting and sharing these experiences among the attendees of the ESMT Annual Forum. After a brief input based on Nora Grasselli’s research on team structures, the majority of this session is designed to be a truly interactive format. Participants will be invited to share their virtual team experiences, which will be collected for a white paper – to be published on the Annual Forum website – and used in additional ESMT publications.<EM>Nora Grasselli is a program director at ESMT.

It was as part of an experiment paid for by the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector (EUGT), a German auto industry group.</P><P>But it’s actually worse than all that. The Beetle was 40 times the legal limit due to software that cheated the system. The tests proved that the VW car was <A href=""https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/jltHCOYGY6HPzBWpiBmx3z?domain=telegraph.co.uk"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">polluting more</A> than an old, 1997-year <A href=""http://fortune.com/fortune500/ford-motor/"" target=""_blank"">Ford</A><A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""F"">(F)</A> truck, and the companies decided not to publicly release the test results.</P><P>The monkey experiment, conducted at the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in Albuquerque, was sponsored by EUGT. The goal was to create (bogus) scientific research proving that new technology had made diesel safe. EUGT received all of its funding from Volkswagen, Daimler, and BMW. It shut down last year amid controversy over its work.</P><P>There was a lot at stake for the companies to produce industry-friendly data. Europe embraced diesel in the 1990s because, on average, diesel cars and trucks produce fewer greenhouse gases than similar gasoline vehicles. But, by the time of the monkey experiments, the negative health effects of diesel were getting more attention.</P><P>A <A href=""http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&amp;mode=XML&amp;reference=A8-2017-0049&amp;language=EN#title2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">report</A> released by the European Parliament showed that 72,000 people in Europe died prematurely because of nitrogen dioxide <mark>pollution</mark> in 2012. Some European cities are creating zones that restrict diesel vehicles, or banning them outright. In Germany, the highest federal court issued a landmark <A href=""https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/ToDtCQWXWgFDMw0kI0eES0?domain=nytimes.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">ruling</A> last month that cities have the right to ban diesel cars. One of those cities petitioning the court for a ban was Stuttgart, the home of Mercedes and Porsche.</P><P>Volkswagen, along with the other German auto companies, also wanted to use the research to increase their diesel sales in the United States. That came to a screeching halt with “Dieselgate” and VW’s emissions cheating scheme in 2015, which has cost the company more than <A href=""https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/JsuACR6X6jhKj32vH27_Uv?domain=reuters.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">$30 billion</A>.</P><P>When I learned about these tests, my mind immediately flashed back to events in my 32-plus year career with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. First, it was the time I was the director of the Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA), where we developed the first report about the dangers of secondhand smoke. Our report got massive pushback from the tobacco industry, which created a variety of misleading research designed to confuse the public about the massive health risks of their products. Cigarette companies had, in fact, run very similar tests on a variety of animals to prove that their products were safe.</P><P>But unlike smoking, diesel engines serve a purpose, are an integral part of the freight transportation systems of the world, and can be made cleaner. Later in my EPA career, as director of the Office of Transportation Air Quality (OTAQ), I led the effort that ended up becoming known as “clean diesel.” With the <A href=""https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/aEnICVOWOnC4NpGxc1F-7K?domain=meca.org"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Heavy Duty Diesel rule in 2000</A>, we took regulatory action to clean diesel fuel and reduce toxic diesel exhaust by 95%. </P><P>As a result of <A href=""https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/aoNaCpYnYLHlo6N4U04g4Z?domain=archive.epa.gov"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this rule</A>, 8,300 premature deaths and 750,000 respiratory illnesses were expected to be prevented annually. Recent <A href=""https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/_Qd8CXDPDpI6VLwXipcFwn?domain=healtheffects.org"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">studies</A> by the Health Effects Institute concluded that the overall toxicity of modern diesel engines are significantly lower than the high-polluting older engines, but even “clean diesel” is not perfectly clean.</P><P>What exacerbates the situation today is endemic cheating and the lack of consistent enforcement of the standards. In my 18 years as director of OTAQ, we had fined car manufacturers and <A href=""https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/OG0nCYEZEqT0EyrLtgwdIC?domain=epa.gov"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">diesel engine and truck companies </A>that were cheating with polluting trucks for over a decade. Just last month, <A href=""https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/uBG9CZ6g6rhmrWJ5irW7HM?domain=autonews.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">new revelations</A> emerged about alleged cheating by Mercedes Benz. And, there is money and politics as witnessed in the recent actions of Scott Pruitt, the current EPA administrator, who is behind a <A href=""https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/PTtqC1wMw3Fj2QVMtD9XTV?domain=nytimes.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">decision</A> to give compliance waiver to the highly polluting diesel truck “glider kits.”</P><P> </P><P>So, how can we make diesel engines completely safe? Realistically, we can’t. There is only one known, long-lasting strategy to address both human health and <mark>climate change</mark>: move to electrification of our transportation system. Electric vehicles have no emissions and help mitigate the environmental challenge of our time: <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Some say the internal combustion engine’s days are numbered, and that may be true for light-duty vehicles nearing the <A href=""https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/es_uC2kXkDTxPDMpUJS8hi?domain=bloomberg.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">“tipping point”</A> for electric vehicles. But in medium-duty and especially heavy-duty vehicles, diesel will continue to play a role as we wait for technologies and infrastructure to become more economically feasible. </P><P>While the passenger vehicle sector is getting electrified, we cannot take our eye off diesel technology. It will be important to continue improvements to diesel engines—and especially enforcement of the rules—to ensure that their health effects continue to be reduced and their contribution to <mark>climate change</mark> is minimized.</P><P>But that doesn’t require industry studies of gassed monkeys.</P><P><I>Margo Oge served the United States Environmental Protection Agency for over 32 years and most </I><EM>recently, was the director of the EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) from 1994 to 2012 and a key architect of the 2025 GHG/CAFE Standards.

Since 2012, he has choked through the harshest drought to hit the Great Plains in a century, punctuated by freakish snowstorms and suffocating gales of dust. His planting season starts earlier in the spring and pushes deeper into winter.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">To adapt, he has embraced an environmentally conscious way of farming that guards against soil erosion and conserves precious water. He can talk for hours about <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration — the trapping of global-warming-causing gases in plant life and in the soil — or the science of the beneficial microbes that enrich his land.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">In short, he is a <mark>climate change</mark> realist. Just don’t expect him to utter the words “<mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“If politicians want to exhaust themselves debating the <mark>climate</mark>, that’s their choice,” Mr. Palen said, walking through fields of freshly planted winter wheat. “I have a farm to run.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-1bytduc emamhsk0""><DIV class=""css-w71pwo emamhsk2""><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Here in north-central Kansas, America’s breadbasket and conservative heartland, the economic realities of agriculture make <mark>climate change</mark> a critical business issue. At the same time, politics and social pressure make frank discussion complicated. This is wheat country, and Donald J. Trump country, and though the weather is acting up, the conservative orthodoxy maintains that the science isn’t settled.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">So while <mark>climate change</mark> is part of daily conversation, it gets disguised as something else.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“People are all talking about it, without talking about it,” said Miriam Horn, the author of a recent book on conservative Americans and the environment, “<A class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""http://rancherfarmerfisherman.com/"" title="""" target=""_blank"">Rancher, Farmer, Fisherman</A>.” “It’s become such a charged topic that there’s a navigation people do.”</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Mr. Palen — he plays his politics close to his vest but allows that he didn’t vote for Hillary Clinton — and others here in Glen Elder and across the state illustrate the delicate dance.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Farmers like him focus on practical issues like erosion or dwindling aquifers. “When you don’t get the rainfall, it’s tough times,” he said.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Regional politicians and business leaders speak of pursuing jobs that clean energy may create, rather than pressing the need to rein in <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.

Richard Nixon, a Republican president, set up the Environmental Protection Agency and signed the <A class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/clean_air_act/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"" title="""" target=""_blank"">Clean Air Act</A>. Ronald Reagan ushered in the Montreal Protocol, the first global treaty to protect the global atmosphere.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Much of that consensus has broken down, in no small part because of a well-financed push by fossil-fuel interests, together with influential Republican allies, to attack well-established research on topics like global warming and push back on environmental regulation. That push began in earnest during the George W. Bush administration as attempts to undercut the Clean Air Act, and since then, the divide has widened.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">President Trump has famously said he believes that <mark>climate change</mark> is a hoax invented by the Chinese, and his administration has purged nearly all mention of <mark>climate</mark>-change programs from the White House and State Department websites. <A class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/some-agencies-told-to-halt-communications-as-trump-administration-moves-in.html"" title="""" target=""_blank"">It has also ordered a freeze</A> on federal grant spending at the E.P.A. and other government agencies.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">The fact that the <mark>climate</mark>-change discourse has also become dominated by liberals has alienated some conservatives, including Mr. Palen. Many people here in particular resent how, in the polarized political landscape of recent years, conservative Americans have been painted as hostile to the environment.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">The Trump campaign successfully seized on that schism, painting Democrats as overzealous environmentalists with little sympathy for the economic realities or social mores of rural America. “Many of our federal environmental laws are being used to oppress farmers instead of actually helping the environment,” Mr. Trump quipped in a widely circulated <A class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""http://farmfutures.com/story-clinton-trump-where-stand-ag-0-146907"" title="""" target=""_blank"">Q. and A.</A> on <A class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""http://farmfutures.com/"" title="""" target=""_blank"">FarmFutures.com</A>. “Farmers care more for the environment than the radical environmentalists.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-1bytduc emamhsk0""><DIV class=""css-w71pwo emamhsk2""><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Still, “it would be a huge mistake to think people voting for Trump were voting against the environment,” Ms. Horn said.

His great-grandfather, the son of an immigrant from Luxembourg, was the first to farm in this stretch of north-central Kansas.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Mr. Palen grew up on the farm, took it over in his 20s, and looked to make his mark. In college, he learned of a farming technique called “no till,” which is intended to more closely mimic the natural prairie ecosystem, and was intrigued by its promise to protect his family fields from Kansas’ relentless winds and sudden downpours. The idea behind no-till farming, he now explains to anyone who will listen, is that plowing the soil destroys its natural structure, causing it to lose its precious moisture and nutrients. That makes it vulnerable to erosion.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Mr. Palen’s fields aren’t tilled. There are no neat furrows. The residue of plants from previous plantings still carpets the earth, offering a layer of protection, and his fields are never bare even after harvest. He alternates wheat and other crops with what he describes as a cocktail of grasses and leafy plants, like grain sorghum, sunflowers and alfalfa, a gesture toward the diversity of the wild prairie. “They say there’s more organisms in a handful of soil than people on the planet,” Mr. Palen said, making his way through a field between plantings. He stooped his tall frame down, dug up a clump of earth, and rolled it between his fingers. He is soft-spoken, yet when he talks of the earth, his excitement is obvious.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“See how it’s firm and holds together?” he said. “See how it doesn’t break down into goo?”</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">No-till farming addresses a dire problem facing American farmers: Almost 1.7 billion tons of topsoil are blown or washed off croplands a year, <A class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcseprd396218.pdf"" title="""" target=""_blank"">according to</A> the Department of Agriculture, resulting in billions of dollars in losses for farmers. Keeping the soil healthy and covered also reduces evaporation by 80 percent, helping farmers conserve water, the department estimates.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Farmers like Mr. Palen also happen to be protecting a vast and valuable <mark>carbon</mark> sink, making him an ally to <mark>climate</mark>-change campaigners. The soil traps far more <mark>carbon</mark> in its depths than all plant and animal life on the earth’s surface, scientists estimate. A <A class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912003635"" title="""" target=""_blank"">2013 study</A> estimated that no-till and other restorative farming methods could achieve up to 15 percent of the total <mark>carbon</mark> reduction needed to stabilize the <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Despite his conservationist streak, Mr. Palen has no affinity for environmentalists. He feels vilified, he says, for his continued use of chemical herbicides and pesticides. (Some organic farmers control weeds by tilling the soil, which Mr. Palen argues causes more ecological harm.) And he remains suspicious of any expansion of government regulations that ignore realities of rural America.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-1bytduc emamhsk0""><DIV class=""css-w71pwo emamhsk2""><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“We want to be left alone,” Mr. Palen said. He singled out the Clean Water Rule, an E.P.A. regulation designed to protect streams and other waterways, as regulatory overreach. Washington types wanted to dictate what he could do with every creek, every puddle, on his farm, he said, putting impossible burdens on farmers.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">And most of them had probably never spent any time on a farm, he said. “We’re the ones working to protect the environment.

An 11-year veteran of the magazine, where he is the crops technology editor, Mr. Gullickson said he had long been on the fence about <mark>climate change</mark>. But that began changing five years ago, when he attended a workshop where a University of Kentucky professor gave a convincing argument, backed by data.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“I started looking at the evidence, at the data and what farmers were doing,” he said. “And it’s clear: The weather has become more extreme these days. And I thought, ‘I’ve never heard of any successful business publication that stayed in business by withholding information.’”</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">So for the first time in the storied magazine’s 115-year-old history, a cover story squarely addressed the science of <mark>climate change</mark>. The October 2014 piece was published under the headline, “@#$*% Weather!”</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“I know what you’re thinking: <mark>Climate change</mark> is just some figment of Al Gore’s imagination adopted by liberal tree-huggers who want to tank the U.S. economy,” Mr. Gullickson wrote.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“Still, think back over some rough weather you’ve endured in recent years and ask yourself these questions,” he continued. “Are springs getting wetter? Are droughts increasing in severity? Are rainstorms increasing in intensity?” The clear answer, he said: “Yes.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-1bytduc emamhsk0""><DIV class=""css-w71pwo emamhsk2""><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Mr. Gullickson said that he and his editor had held lengthy discussions leading up to the article’s publication. His editor in chief, Dave Kurns, was supportive, he said, but also warned that the piece could generate backlash.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Mr. Kurns spoke candidly over concerns of a backlash in an editor’s note that led the issue. When he became the magazine’s editor two years earlier, he said, he had been warned, “Never use the words ‘<mark>climate change</mark>.’”</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“I was told: ‘Readers hate that phrase. Just talk about the weather,’” he wrote.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">The industry publication, which has a circulation of 390,000, was influenced by some of the biggest names in agriculture taking a stand on the issue, Mr. Gullickson said. The agricultural giant Cargill <A class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/business/energy-environment/<mark>climate</mark>-changes-bottom-line.html"" title="""" target=""_blank"">has started to lobby</A> members of Congress and urged farmers to take <mark>climate change</mark> seriously, saying inaction would be detrimental to the United States economy.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">The response to the magazine’s take on the issues has been split.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“When you start quoting ‘<mark>climate</mark> scientists’ and the United Nations,” wrote in one reader, Bill Clinger, a farmer based in Harpster, Ohio, “you are as nutty as Al Gore.” Measures to control emissions, he said, “are just seductive names for socialist programs intended to micromanage people and businesses.”</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Mr. Gullickson said some readers thanked him. “Finally, a farming magazine comes to terms with what is going on with the weather,” wrote Paul Jereczek of Dodge, Wis.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Reached by phone, Mr. Jereczek, who runs a dairy farm, expressed exasperation at people’s inability to speak openly. “The phrase has become so politicized, it’s just hard to talk about,” he said. “But we talk about everything else. Even round here, protecting soil is such a hot topic right now. But we talk about the soil, saving fertilizer, that sort of thing.”</P><H2 class=""css-91b9p3 eqpy7av0"">Grouse to the Rescue</H2><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Mark Salvo, vice president at the wildlife conservation group <A class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""http://www.defenders.org/"" title="""" target=""_blank"">Defenders of Wildlife</A>, might be a walking, talking stereotype of the kind of environmentalist who so frustrates Mr. Palen.

Today, though, the grouse is under threat — its populations reduced to isolated pockets in western Kansas, Colorado and the Texas-New Mexico border as its habitat succumbs to <mark>climate</mark>-induced drought, farming, drilling and other human activity.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">The group has been petitioning the Fish and Wildlife Service to relist the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The bird found itself taken off the list after a lawsuit in 2014 backed by the oil and gas industry, which argues that any protective measures would mean added costs for energy developers.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Mr. Salvo has found that to gain allies it doesn’t always help to start with the role <mark>climate change</mark> plays in harming the bird’s habitat. Instead, his movement has tried to find common ground, highlighting the historical heritage of the lesser prairie-chicken. In the “Little House on the Prairie” novels, Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote about eating prairie-chicken mush.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Mr. Salvo also stresses how grouse-friendly practices can be good for farming, too, backing a federal program that provides financial aid to private landowners who adopt those practices. Leaving corn stubble standing after harvest gives the birds food and places to hide, for example, while also helping farmers protect the soil.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">“Sometimes, to gain allies, it helps to focus on issues of common concern, to support local economic development as well as species conservation,” he said. “It helps everybody come to the table.”</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">Last week, Mr. Palen, the farmer, was again talking weather — if not <mark>climate change</mark> — at a <A class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""http://www.notill.org/"" title="""" target=""_blank"">conference of no-till farmers </A> in Salina, Kan. Sessions included “Using Your Water Efficiently,” “Making Weather Work for You in 2017” and “Building Healthy Soil With Mob Grazing,” a practice that helps to fertilize the land.</P><P class=""css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"">And yes, Mr. Palen says, he is on board with saving the lesser prairie-chicken. “I often think of ways I can protect their habitat,” he said. “I enjoy wildlife.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""bottom-of-article""><DIV class=""PrintInformation-printInformation--2_6hD"">A version of this article appears in print on , on Page BU1 of the New York edition with the headline: Talk About the Weather<SPAN>. <A href=""http://www.nytreprints.com/"">Order Reprints</A> | <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html"">Today’s Paper</A> | <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY"">Subscribe</A></SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""RelatedCoverage-relatedcoverage--LmkKX""><HEADER class=""RelatedCoverage-sectionHeader--TT9ds""><H3 class=""RelatedCoverage-sectionHeading--2zJtL"">Related Coverage</H3></HEADER></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

                                hydrogen-based economy.</P><P>Proponents of a government-sanctioned scheme to derive hydrogen from water and use it to power all ground transportation as well as Iceland's large fishing fleet admit that their plans have been set back at least 10 years
                                and may have to be altered to allow for electric cars.</P><P>Ten years ago, Iceland started experimenting with hydrogen applications in transportation. Three city buses ran solely on hydrogen in Reykjavik for three years. As many as 16 passenger vehicles ran on hydrogen in the city.
                                Twelve remain in operation today, including some that tourists can rent at the local Hertz office and refuel at a Shell gasoline station that has been modified to also dispense hydrogen.</P><P>But after a promising start, Iceland's hydrogen experiment has slowed to a crawl.</P><P>&quot;We would like to have a larger hydrogen car fleet in the next 12 months, but it's a question of cost. It depends on car manufacturers,&quot; said Jon Bjorn Skulason, general manager of Icelandic New Energy, a joint
                                venture of Daimler, Shell, Norsk Hydro, Iceland National Power Co., Reykjavik Energy and the University of Iceland.</P><P>&quot;We're following the lead of the car manufacturers. We are a testing ground, but it's not entirely up to us. All the manufacturers are looking at electromobility and we see strong activity at car companies in
                                Germany and Japan. U.S. companies have been a bit distracted by the problems at GM and Chrysler.&quot;</P><P>Iceland had hoped to complete its switch from fossil fuels to hydrogen by 2040, but now that target has been moved by 10 years.</P><P>&quot;In the past years, teams from all the big car manufacturing companies visited us and said they intended to market fuel cell-powered hydrogen cars shortly after 2010,&quot; said Bragi Arnason, a professor of chemistry
                                at the University of Iceland in Reykjavik. &quot;Of course, because of the current world crisis, there will be a delay.&quot;</P><P><SPAN class=""bold"">The long quest of 'Professor Hydrogen'</SPAN></P><P>Arnason, 74, is nicknamed &quot;Professor Hydrogen&quot; because he has dedicated his life to his dream of powering Iceland with hydrogen. In 1976, Arnason realized that despite abundant renewable energy sources, Iceland was
                                importing more than 40 percent of the energy it consumed as fossil fuel. He began looking for a replacement in synthetic gasoline, methanol and ammonia, finally settling on hydrogen because it was cheaper and easier to
                                produce.</P><P>In fact, Iceland has been producing hydrogen on a large scale from water by electrolysis for 50 years, making 2,000 tons per year for fertilizers. To power the country's whole transportation and fishing fleet would require
                                80,000 to 90,000 tons of hydrogen per year, Skulason said. It would have the added benefit of cutting Iceland's <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions by 66 percent.</P><P>Under the Kyoto Protocol, Iceland is allowed to increase its emissions by 10 percent from 1990 levels. But the country's power-intensive aluminum industry, which is expected to expand, will force it to exceed that goal.
                                Since indoor heating (as well as heating of the streets and sidewalks of Reykjavik, which stay ice-free in the winter) is already geothermal and all electricity production is either hydro or geothermal, the country's
                                best shot to reduce its <mark>carbon</mark> emissions is curbing fossil fuel usage in fishing and transportation.</P><P>Taken together, these sectors make up only 28 percent of Iceland's energy consumption -- about the same as industrial activity -- compared to 40 percent for space heating.</P><P>In 1998, the government signed an official document proclaiming its desire to transform Iceland into a hydrogen-powered society. Since Iceland has transportation systems and standards similar to those of all other developed
                                nations, hydrogen supporters here hoped that success in this tiny country under severe weather conditions could be replicated elsewhere in a more forgiving <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P><SPAN class=""bold"">Financial bummer for one of the world's 'happiest' countries</SPAN></P><P>Once ranked the fourth-happiest country in the world, Icelanders thought they could afford such lofty ideals. Then their three main banks collapsed last fall, taking the economy down with them and pushing unemployment from
                                1 percent to 9 percent today in the North Atlantic island of just 300,000 inhabitants. The Icelandic crown lost half its value, and household consumption is expected to shrink by a quarter, as inflation hit a peak of nearly
                                19 percent in January.</P><P>The three original hydrogen buses did not lead to a wholesale transformation of the Reykjavik fleet. Instead, now all buses run on conventional fuels. &quot;The bus project has now been terminated; we are waiting for the next
                                generation to be built,&quot; Arnason said.</P><P>Storing hydrogen in a small vehicle is tricky, so buses were prime candidates for the Icelandic experiment. Enough hydrogen can be stored on board as pressurized gas to operate the buses throughout the day, refueling in less
                                than seven minutes.</P><P>For private cars, the storage problem makes it difficult to engineer a car that will travel a long distance without refueling. The Icelanders have experimented with Ford, Mercedes and modified Toyota Prius hydrogen cars.</P><P>The cold winter caused trouble for the Toyotas, which did not heat rapidly upon starting and had water leaking into the engine oil. Two engine heaters were installed to fix the problem, but test drivers complained about the
                                limited range the Prius had on hydrogen -- only 100 miles.</P><P>The Mercedes fuel cell A-Class exceeded all expectations and performed well in Iceland's harsh <mark>climate</mark>, according to Icelandic New Energy. Two A-Class vehicles have been driven thousands of miles without needing any service.
                                They proved to have a range of 225 miles at optimum hydrogen pressure.</P><P>Fuel cell-powered Ford Focuses and Explorers were also tested, the former with a range of 150-200 miles per tank and the latter with a range of 350 miles -- the longest-range hydrogen vehicle to date. Skulason himself drives
                                one of the Explorers to work every day. &quot;It would be very difficult to go back to a gasoline car if I ever have to,&quot; he said.</P><P><SPAN class=""bold"">A whale-watching boat gets hydrogen fuel, but not the fleet</SPAN></P><P>If everyone drove a car like Skulason's, Iceland would only need 15 hydrogen fueling stations, Arnason said. &quot;This shows how easy it is to start introducing the hydrogen economy in Iceland if we could purchase hydrogen-powered
                                cars. If our vision becomes reality, there would be no more heavy trucks on the roads transporting fossil fuel all around the country,&quot; he said, acknowledging that he likely won't be around to see that day.</P><P>Discovered in the eighth century by Irish monks, Iceland was first colonized by Norway, then taken over by Denmark in the 14th century. It became fully independent in 1944, although Denmark's influence can still be felt
                                in Reykjavik and many Icelanders still can speak Danish as a second language.</P><P>The fishing industry has been Iceland's traditional economic base. Almost all of the fish caught by the country's 3,000 trawlers is exported, accounting for 37 percent of Iceland's overall exports last year,
                                second only to the aluminum industry, which represented 52 percent of exports, according to Statistics Iceland.</P><P>Iceland's fishing boats are sometimes at sea for up to six weeks and need to store large amounts of fuel. Pressurized hydrogen won't work here, while liquid hydrogen would be prohibitively expensive. According to
                                Arnason, the only near-term solution is to store hydrogen bound in methanol.</P><P>&quot;Technically, it is possible to produce sufficient methanol in Iceland to power the entire fishing fleet by combining electrolytically produced hydrogen and <mark>carbon</mark> oxides currently emitted from the metals industry,&quot;
                                Arnason said. &quot;This could reduce the greenhouse gas emission from the fishing sector to about 45 percent of the present level.&quot;</P><P>But for now, the only vessel running on hydrogen is a whale-watching boat, the Elding. Its main engine still uses oil, but when the boat shuts it down for tourists to observe the whales without disturbing them, the auxiliary
                                engine runs on hydrogen to produce the electricity needed to keep other systems running.</P><P><SPAN class=""bold"">Electric cars may now come first, despite fuel cell potential</SPAN></P><P>Many tourists know Iceland especially for the warm, sulfurous waters of the Blue Lagoon near the airport. Most don't know, though, that the Blue Lagoon also fuels a power plant, as do numerous hot springs dotting this
                                island.</P><P>On paper, at least, Iceland is still paradise for renewable energy enthusiasts. It has a geothermal potential of 20 trillion watt-hours (TWh) per year, of which only 1 percent has been harnessed, and a hydro energy potential
                                of 30 TWh per year, of which only 15 percent has been harnessed.</P><P>Despite recent setbacks, Skulason and Arnason dream of a day when the huge amounts of renewable electricity available to Icelanders will be used to produce hydrogen that will propel their way of life into the future.</P><P>&quot;The goal is to have a fully hydrogen-powered economy by 2050, including the marine fleet,&quot; Skulason said. &quot;The vehicle fleet could be done much faster. We only have 200,000 cars in the country, so it's
                                easy to change them, but it depends on cost and availability.&quot;</P><P>Skulason admitted that some Icelanders may choose electric cars over hydrogen cars.</P><P>&quot;Hydrogen won't be the only fuel; part of the fleet will be electric. But hydrogen will fit in the portfolio,&quot; he said. &quot;Electric cars don't have the range yet. Plus, we need four-wheel drive cars in
                                Iceland because we have some pretty bad winters. It's not something electric vehicles can fulfill 100 percent. I'm not sure battery technology will go beyond 150 miles.&quot;</P><P>Another issue is the charging time of up to eight hours now necessary for batteries used in electric cars. &quot;Faster charging could be a possibility in the future. We are open-minded, but we don't think a battery-operated
                                electrical engine would be good for the fishing fleet.&quot;</P><P class=""note"">Copyright 2009 E&amp;E Publishing.

Animal agriculture is a major component of the U.S. agriculture system (<A href=""/report/sectors/agriculture#graphic-16666"">Figure 6.1</A>). Changing climatic conditions affect animal agriculture in four primary ways: 1) feed-grain production, availability, and price; 2) pastures and forage crop production and quality; 3) animal health, growth, and reproduction; and 4) disease and pest distributions.<SUP id=""fnref:7c21f424-4e37-46f6-9f4a-51efebdc4ffa""><A href=""#fn:7c21f424-4e37-46f6-9f4a-51efebdc4ffa"" rel=""footnote"">51</A></SUP> The optimal environmental conditions for livestock production include temperatures and other conditions for which animals do not need to significantly alter behavior or physiological functions to maintain relatively constant core body temperature. Optimum animal core body temperature is often maintained within a 4°F to 5°F range, while deviations from this range can cause animals to become stressed. This can disrupt performance, production, and fertility, limiting the animals’ ability to produce meat, milk, or eggs. In many species, deviations in core body temperature in excess of 4°F to 5°F cause significant reductions in productive performance, while deviations of 9°F to 12.6°F often result in death.<SUP id=""fnref:9836570e-819f-461c-8e6c-4fbd5c02c8d8""><A href=""#fn:9836570e-819f-461c-8e6c-4fbd5c02c8d8"" rel=""footnote"">52</A></SUP> For cattle that breed during spring and summer, exposure to high temperatures reduces conception rates. Livestock and dairy production are more affected by the number of days of extreme heat than by increases in average temperature.<SUP id=""fnref:f2d47bcb-0b5f-468c-b574-a9f155403ed7""><A href=""#fn:f2d47bcb-0b5f-468c-b574-a9f155403ed7"" rel=""footnote"">53</A></SUP> Elevated humidity exacerbates the impact of high temperatures on animal health and performance.
</P><P>
Animals respond to extreme temperature events (hot or cold) by altering their metabolic rates and behavior. Increases in extreme temperature events may become more likely for animals, placing them under conditions where their efficiency in meat, milk, or egg production is affected. Projected increases in extreme heat events (Ch. 2: Our Changing <mark>Climate</mark>, <A href=""/report/our-changing-<mark>climate</mark>/extreme-weather"">Key Message 7</A>) will further increase the stress on animals, leading to the potential for greater impacts on production.<SUP id=""fnref:f2d47bcb-0b5f-468c-b574-a9f155403ed7""><A href=""#fn:f2d47bcb-0b5f-468c-b574-a9f155403ed7"" rel=""footnote"">53</A></SUP> Meat animals are managed for a high rate of weight gain (high metabolic rate), which increases their potential risk when exposed to high temperature conditions. Exposure to heat stress disrupts metabolic functions in animals and alters their internal temperature when exposure occurs. Exposure to high temperature events can be costly to producers, as was the case in 2011, when heat-related production losses exceeded $1 billion.<SUP id=""fnref:0a2ea320-932c-42ab-9a9b-0a64237f0f4f""><A href=""#fn:0a2ea320-932c-42ab-9a9b-0a64237f0f4f"" rel=""footnote"">54</A></SUP></P><P>
Livestock production systems that provide partial or total shelter to reduce thermal environmental challenges can reduce the risk and vulnerability associated with extreme heat. In general, livestock such as poultry and swine are managed in housed systems where airflow can be controlled and housing temperature modified to minimize or buffer against adverse environmental conditions. However, management and energy costs associated with increased temperature regulation will increase for confined production enterprises and may require modification of shelter and increased water use for cooling.

In addition to extant species already in the U.S., exotic weeds, diseases, and pests have particular significance in that: 1) they can often be invasive (that is, arrive without normal biological/ecological controls) and highly damaging; 2) with increasing international trade, there are numerous high-threat, high-impact species that will arrive on commodities from areas where some species even now are barely known to modern science, but which have the potential to emerge under a changed <mark>climate</mark> regime to pose significant risk of establishment in the U.S. and economic loss; and 3) can take advantage of “disturbances,” where <mark>climate</mark> variability acts as an additional ecological disturbance. Improved models and observational data related to how many agricultural regions will experience declines in animal and plant production from increased stress due to weeds, diseases, insect pests, and other <mark>climate change</mark> induced stresses will need to be developed.
</P><P>
A key issue is the extent of the interaction between components of the natural biological system (for example, pests) and the economic biological system (for example, crop or animal). For insects, increased populations are a factor; however, their effect on the plant may be dependent upon the phenological stage of the plant when the insect is at specific phenological stages.<SUP id=""fnref:3baf471f-751f-4d68-9227-4197fdbb6e5d""><A href=""#fn:3baf471f-751f-4d68-9227-4197fdbb6e5d"" rel=""footnote"">1</A></SUP></P><P>

Water and soil that are lost from the field are no longer available to support crop growth. The increasing intensity of storms and the shifting of rainfall patterns toward more spring precipitation in the Midwest may lead to more scenes similar to this one (<A href=""/report/sectors/agriculture#graphic-16672"">Figure 6.7)</A>. An analysis of the rainfall patterns across Iowa has shown there has not been an increase in total annual precipitation; however, there has been a large increase in the number of days with heavy rainfall (<A href=""/report/sectors/agriculture#graphic-16674"">Figure 6.9)</A>. The increase in spring precipitation is evidenced by a decrease of three days in the number of workable days in the April to May period during 2001 through 2011 in Iowa compared to the period 1980-2000.<SUP id=""fnref:3baf471f-751f-4d68-9227-4197fdbb6e5d""><A href=""#fn:3baf471f-751f-4d68-9227-4197fdbb6e5d"" rel=""footnote"">1</A></SUP> To offset this increased precipitation, producers have been installing subsurface drainage to remove more water from the fields at a cost of $500 per acre (Figure 6.8). These are elaborate systems designed to move water from the landscape to allow agricultural operations to occur in the spring. Water erosion and runoff is only one portion of the spectrum of extreme precipitation. Wind erosion could increase in areas with persistent drought because of the reduction in vegetative cover.

Changes in production practices can have more effect than <mark>climate change</mark> on soil erosion; however, changes in <mark>climate</mark> will exacerbate the effects of management practices that do not protect the soil surface from the forces of rainfall.

Rising temperatures and CO<SUB>2</SUB> and shifting precipitation patterns will alter crop-water requirements, crop-water availability, crop productivity, and costs of water access across the agricultural landscape. Higher temperatures are projected to increase both evaporative losses from land and water surfaces and transpiration losses (through plant leaves) from non-crop land cover, potentially reducing annual runoff and streamflow for a given amount of precipitation. The resulting shift in crop health will, in turn, drive changes in cropland allocations and production systems.

Important new evidence (cited above) confirmed many of the findings in the past Synthesis and Assessment Product on agriculture<SUP id=""fnref:76db17ce-354b-4f0c-ad10-3e701c0387fc""><A href=""#fn:76db17ce-354b-4f0c-ad10-3e701c0387fc"" rel=""footnote"">6</A></SUP> which informed the 2009 National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment.<SUP id=""fnref:e251f590-177e-4ba6-8ed1-6f68b5e54c8a""><A href=""#fn:e251f590-177e-4ba6-8ed1-6f68b5e54c8a"" rel=""footnote"">7</A></SUP></P><P>
One key area of uncertainty is the timing of extreme events during the phenological stage of the plant or the growth stage of the animal. For example, plants are more sensitive to extreme high temperatures during the pollination stage compared to vegetative growth stages.<SUP id=""fnref:a2704ef3-5be4-41ee-8dfa-4c82e416a292""><A href=""#fn:a2704ef3-5be4-41ee-8dfa-4c82e416a292"" rel=""footnote"">8</A></SUP> A parallel example for animals is relatively strong sensitivity to high temperatures during the conception phase.<SUP id=""fnref:f2d47bcb-0b5f-468c-b574-a9f155403ed7""><A href=""#fn:f2d47bcb-0b5f-468c-b574-a9f155403ed7"" rel=""footnote"">53</A></SUP> Milk and egg production are also vulnerable to temperature extremes. The effects of extreme combinations of weather variables must be considered, such as elevated humidity in concert with high temperatures.<SUP id=""fnref:f2d47bcb-0b5f-468c-b574-a9f155403ed7""><A href=""#fn:f2d47bcb-0b5f-468c-b574-a9f155403ed7"" rel=""footnote"">53</A></SUP></P><P>
Other key uncertainties include inadequate precision in simulations of the timing of extreme events relative to short time periods of crop vulnerability, and temperatures close to key thresholds such as freezing.<SUP id=""fnref:41452674-2b8f-472c-8388-02c670541943""><A href=""#fn:41452674-2b8f-472c-8388-02c670541943"" rel=""footnote"">33</A></SUP> The uncertainty is amplified by the rarity of extreme events; this rarity means there are infrequent opportunities to study the impact of extreme events. In general, a shift of the distribution of temperatures can increase the frequency of threshold exceedance.<SUP id=""fnref:3baf471f-751f-4d68-9227-4197fdbb6e5d""><A href=""#fn:3baf471f-751f-4d68-9227-4197fdbb6e5d"" rel=""footnote"">1</A></SUP></P><P>
The information base can be enhanced by improving the forecast of extreme events, given that the effect of extreme events on plants or animals is known.<SUP id=""fnref:70e31ee1-6e73-45f1-b993-cf25d371651a""><A href=""#fn:70e31ee1-6e73-45f1-b993-cf25d371651a"" rel=""footnote"">18</A></SUP><SUP>,</SUP><SUP id=""fnref:bc4e302f-0956-4bb0-b345-e84dfb03223f""><A href=""#fn:bc4e302f-0956-4bb0-b345-e84dfb03223f"" rel=""footnote"">74</A></SUP></P><H3>

Even mainstream manufacturers like General Motors, Toyota, Volkswagen and <mark>Daimler AG</mark> have extensive plans in place to add hybrids, plug-ins and pure battery-electric vehicles to their line-ups. Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz, for example, plans 10 PHEVs by the end of next year.</P><P>What has long motivated a legion of Tesla fans — and driven the company’s stock to the sort of level generally reserved for Silicon Valley tech firms — is Musk’s vision and personal drive. He is also an effective user of social media, routinely tweeting on a variety of topics. And he released his latest strategy, appropriately enough, on Tesla’s blog site.</P><P>Musk is nothing, if not a visionary, and the Master Plan, Part Deux will clearly speak to the legion of followers who look to him to help change the world, with a focus on sustainability.</P><P>“By definition, we must at some point achieve a <mark>sustainable</mark> energy economy or we will run out of fossil fuels to burn and civilization will collapse,” he wrote. “Given that we must get off fossil fuels anyway and that virtually all scientists agree that dramatically increasing atmospheric and oceanic <mark>carbon</mark> levels is insane, the faster we achieve sustainability, the better.”</P><P>Of course, sustainability comes in many forms, and the challenge Tesla faces is, perhaps first and foremost, sustaining its own business. The carmaker is barely operating in the black — and, even then, only by using its own accounting procedures. Despite a stock price that has been running in excess of $200 a share in recent months, Tesla has been so short of cash it needed a nearly $2 billion May public offering to help fund the final development of its Model 3 sedan.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""section___1NkVN""><DIV class=""body___vDyiy""><SECTION class=""container___Ltqrl""><DIV class=""info___3BGcG""><H1 class=""title___1CDQX""><A href=""/video/tesla-s-master-plan-part-deux-is-revealed-729851971950"" to=""https://www.nbcnews.com/video/tesla-s-master-plan-part-deux-is-revealed-729851971950"">Tesla's 'Master Plan, Part Deux' Is Revealed</A></H1><SPAN class=""duration___27sD5"">01:13</SPAN></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""section___1NkVN lastSection___3zqOR""><DIV class=""body___vDyiy""><P>That’s Tesla’s first entry into the mainstream auto market, and initial signs are positive, with about 400,000 advanced reservations for the vehicle, which is set to debut at around $35,000. Tesla’s goal is to launch late next year and, by 2018, be selling 500,000 vehicles annually — or nearly 10 times its 2015 volume.</P><P>Despite the initial reception for the Model 3 it could be argued that the carmaker missed the mark, focusing on a new sedan at a time when Americans by the millions are abandoning passenger cars for light trucks. So, the addition of a compact SUV in the new Master Plan appears aimed at rectifying that problem. And it will be joined by a “new kind of pickup truck,” a move that will take it into one of America’s largest product segments.</P><P><A href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/electric-cars-aren-t-enough-tesla-now-going-vegan-n497396"">Read More: Electric Cars Aren't Enough: Now Tesla is Going Vegan</A></P><P>But Musk’s vision is that cars alone won’t save the world. Tesla may have been launched as an electric car company but it has been broadening its reach, notably with the addition of the Powerwall battery backup system launched last year.</P><P>Now, Musk wants to see the company become even more of a one-stop shop for all your green energy needs. That includes the ability to buy an all-in-one solar roof that would take advantage of Tesla’s proposed acquisition of SolarCity.</P><P>That move has generated plenty of controversy, in part due to the questionable synergies of the two companies, but also due to a seeming conflict of interest. A close Musk relative runs SolarCity and the Tesla CEO himself serves as the solar panel company’s chairman.</P><P>A fair section of Musk’s Master Plan takes a defensive tone. There is a strong defense laid out for the Solar City deal, for one thing. Pointing to the breadth of the Master Plan, Musk wrote that, “We can't do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different companies, which is why we need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies.”</P><P>The blog post also downplays the intense criticism that has arisen in recent weeks, ever since Tesla belatedly revealed the fatal crash of a Model S running in semi-autonomous Autopilot mode in Florida on May 9. In fact, the brouhaha, and news of two more crashes and several federal probes — one by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the other by the National Transportation Safety Board — may explain why the release of the new Master Plan comes a week later than Musk originally said.</P><P>&quot;When used correctly, (Autopilot) is already significantly safer than a person driving by themselves,&quot; he wrote in the new blog post.</P><P>If anything, Musk made it clear he is committed to fully autonomous driving, though he suggested it will need at least five more years of testing. But eventually, he made clear, Tesla plans to make all of its vehicles, commercial and retail, self-driving.</P><P><A href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/what-s-next-tesla-amid-safety-probes-weak-production-n610251"">Read More: What's Next for Tesla, Amid Safety Probes and Weak Production?</A></P><P>The company even appears ready to get into the ride-sharing game – in part by taking advantage of autonomous technology. Tesla appears to be interested in taking on giants like Uber and Lyft, and will tap its owners to help field a large fleet of vehicles.</P><P>“You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation,” he explained.</P><P>As broad as the Master Plan appears to be, the initial response is running from wildly upbeat to skeptical.</P><P>“The document is relatively short on details,” cautioned Deutsche Bank analyst Rod Lache, and though it discusses new products and ventures, he added, it does not lay out specific financial targets.</P><P>That concern seems reflected in Tesla’s stock price, which is sharply down since the Master Plan was announced, dropping 3.3 percent by Thursday afternoon.</P><P>Broad visions can be useful for a company entering uncharted territory. But Tesla is no longer a start-up. And there are growing demands for it to deliver. It needs to show that what it has already bitten off will work, many observers believe, before it moves on to the next grand plan.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""section___1NkVN""><DIV class=""body___vDyiy""><DIV class=""mobileNewsletter___3NlNx""><DIV class=""container___jsHMh news___34TC8""><DIV class=""signupBackground___27LhS""><H1 class=""signupTitle___15fvr"">Breaking News Emails</H1><DIV class=""signupForeground___2FAE6""><DIV class=""signupMessage___3ctJh"">Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Subject to examination and approval by the responsible competition authorities, the BMW Group and <mark>Daimler AG</mark> plan to combine and strategically expand their existing on-demand mobility offering in the areas of CarSharing, Ride-Hailing, Parking, Charging and Multimodality. 
</P><P>
Each company will hold a 50% stake in a joint-venture model comprising both companies’ mobility services. The two companies will remain competitors in their respective core businesses.
</P><P>
The aim of this transaction is to become a leading provider of innovative mobility services. Both automotive manufacturers aim to shape the mobility of the future to be able to offer their customers unique experiences and support their partners, such as cities and communes, in achieving <mark>sustainable</mark> urban mobility.
</P><P>
The partners intend to offer their customers a holistic ecosystem of intelligent, seamlessly connected mobility services, available at the tap of a finger. Together, the BMW Group and <mark>Daimler AG</mark> plan to grow this new business model sustainably and enable rapid global scaling of services.
</P><P>
Working as partners, both companies are thereby addressing the challenges arising from urban mobility and changing customer wishes, and cooperating with cities, municipalities and other interest groups to improve quality of life in major cities. The merger will promote electromobility, for example, by offering electrified CarSharing vehicles, as well as easy access to charging and parking options. As a result, it will become even easier to experience and use <mark>sustainable</mark> mobility services.
</P><P>
The equally-owned joint venture model is designed to combine services in the following five areas:
</P><OL><LI><P><B>Multimodal and on-demand mobility with moovel and ReachNow:</B>
Intelligent and seamless connectivity between different mobility offerings—including booking and payment—will create significant added value for users. It will also offer possible solutions for the challenges of urban private transport.</P></LI><LI><P><B>CarSharing with Car2Go and DriveNow:</B>
Car2Go and DriveNow operate a total of 20,000 vehicles in 31 major international cities. CarSharing enables better utilization of vehicles and thus helps reduce the total number of vehicles in cities. More than four million customers already use these CarSharing services.</P></LI><LI><P><B>Ride-Hailing with mytaxi, Chauffeur Privé, Clever Taxi and Beat:</B>
With Europe’s largest taxi app, simply order a taxi or use a licensed driver in France for a ride in the French metropolises. In total, 13 million customers and some 140,000 drivers are already using the modern, practical and fast way of Ride-Hailing with mytaxi, Clever Taxi and Beat or private hire vehicle service Chauffeur Privé. Innovative offers such as mytaximatch, in which people not known to each other share a taxi at a fingertip, make an important contribution to reducing inner-city traffic by eliminating numerous individual trips in the urban space.</P></LI><LI><P><B>Parking with ParkNow and Parkmobile Group/Parkmobile LLC:</B>
Ticketless, cashless on-street parking or help finding, reserving and paying for off-street parking in a garage. Innovative digital parking services reduce the time and the amount of driving involved in finding a parking space. This will reduce traffic significantly, as cars searching for parking spaces currently account for around 30% of road traffic.</P></LI><LI><P><B>Charging with ChargeNow and Digital Charging Solutions:</B>
Easy access (incl. location, charging and payment) to the world’s largest network of public charging stations with more than 143,000 charging points worldwide. Combined with parking privileges in cities, this will support the expansion of electromobility, by helping people get to know this drive technology and integrate it easily into their mobility needs.</P></LI></OL><P>
The formation of the joint venture will produce a significant valuation and earnings effect at Daimler Financial Services. If the approval of the competition authorities is received this year, following adjustments will be made to the group outlook for <mark>Daimler AG</mark>: The company expects EBIT for Daimler Financial Services to be significantly higher than the previous year; for the Group as a whole, this means EBIT is likely to be slightly higher than the previous year.
</P><P>
If approved by the relevant authorities in the course of this year, the formation of the joint venture will trigger a one-time valuation and earnings effect in the BMW AG’s group financial statement and thus lead to an adjustment of the company’s guidance: Under these circumstances, pre-tax earnings on Group level would increase slightly in 2018 compared with the previous year. The valuation and earnings effect would have no impact on the EBIT margin in the automotive segment.
</P><P>
The joint project is subject to examination and approval by the respective competition authorities. The best-possible customer experience is already the focus of both partners’ services. Therefore, initially nothing will change for the millions of customers, with existing services still being provided to the same extent and with the same level of quality.

The team also represents Pfizer in regulatory matters and Superfund litigation, including in the Atlantic Resources Superfund litigation and Passaic River Superfund litigation.</P><P><STRONG>First Solar, ongoing</STRONG>
Advise First Solar, a US-based solar panels manufacturer, on an on-going basis on a range of environmental issues at EU level as well as at a national level in several countries around the globe. Our advice for this company requires a deep knowledge of <mark>climate change</mark> legislation and a clear understanding of EU and national environmental and energy strategies in this field. We have been dealing with all aspects of environmental regulations relevant to manufacturing the product, putting it on the market and then its treatment as waste and other issues related to recycling.</P><P><STRONG>Florida Crystals Corp., and Okeelanta Corp., ongoing</STRONG>
Represented Florida Crystals Corp., and its subsidiaries in relation to the development of major civil works projects to restore the Florida Everglades. Congress authorized the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, an US$8 billion civil works plan framework to restore the South Florida ecosystem while providing for the other water-related needs of the region. The Firm represents Florida Crystals in regard to the ongoing administrative process, and, in particular, legal compliance with civil works and environmental statutes. Among the issues raised in this process are disputes over water rights, endangered species, water quality impacts to the Everglades, and government acquisition of tens of thousands of acres of agricultural land.</P><P><STRONG>Hess Corporation, 2014</STRONG>
Acted as environmental counsel to Hess Corporation in connection with Hess' divestiture of its East Coast terminal network to Buckeye Partners LP for US$850 million. This transaction involved 20 large bulk oil storage terminals located along the US Atlantic coast and in St. Lucia, and Hess' recently closed refinery in New Jersey. We coordinated the sell-side environmental due diligence, managed the environmental aspects of the auction process, and negotiated the purchase agreement and related environmental agreements.</P><P><STRONG>City of Dania Beach, Florida, 2014</STRONG>
Represented the City of Dania Beach with regard to the City's challenges to the expansion of the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The US$800 million airport expansion plan will significantly expand the airport with a lengthened commercial jet runway, but will expose more than 1000 homes to &quot;incompatible&quot; noise levels. After years of litigation, and five separate lawsuits related to the expansion, the City and the airport's owner, Broward County, reached a public settlement which resolved all outstanding issues. This settlement ends one of the most significant long-term environmental controversies in Florida, and has been recognized for its innovative approach.</P><P><STRONG>Fortis, Inc., 2014</STRONG>
Represented Fortis, Inc., Canada's largest investor-owned gas and electric distribution utility, in its US$4.3 billion acquisition of UNS Energy Corporation. This environmentally complex transaction involved a due diligence assessment and transfer of 10 power generation facilities. We assessed and advised on the potential impact on these facilities by emissions control requirements associated with greenhouse gas regulation, the Clean Air Act's provisions and other environmental regulations. We also advised on pending federal litigation impacts concerning the acquired entities' emissions control mandates. Finally, we provided strategic guidance on impacts from Cooling Water Intake Structure rules under the Clean Water Act and the management of coal combustion residuals, and soil and groundwater contamination. </P><P><STRONG>Daimler, 2013</STRONG>
We advised Mercedes Benz France before the French Conseil d'Etat. The dispute concerned an order of the French government preventing the registration of several of the car maker's models.

Jacobs Group, 2012</STRONG>
Represented R.E. Jacobs Group, one of the nation's largest developers of shopping centers, in a dispute regarding the impact of a development. Environmental groups contended that the wetlands permit issued for the project violated the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act (CWA), and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The district court judge rejected the plaintiffs' Endangered Species Act claim, but concluded that the regulatory agency should have prepared an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) instead of an Environmental Assessment (EA), and had not sufficiently considered different site configurations. Both sides appealed the district judge's decision and in 2012 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's CWA and NEPA rulings, allowing the development to proceed.</P><P><STRONG>European Trade Association</STRONG>
Advising one of the largest and most influential EU trade associations on certain aspects of the EU ETS Directive. We provided a comprehensive analysis of the EU environmental, trade and competition law implications of the treatment of emissions from certain production processes and invoked a broad range of detailed legal arguments which were successful in achieving key amendments to the text.</P><P><STRONG>Baltic Sea Pipeline</STRONG>
Advising Nord Stream in all legal aspects of the Nord Stream Project, a gas pipeline which will transport gas from the gas field Yuzhno-Russkoye (Russia) through the Baltic Sea to Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (Germany).

Ah, but <EM>nicht wahr</EM>: Mercedes’ six-figure sports car and Chevy’s muscle coupe both benefit from a benign form of <mark>climate change</mark>. Specifically, convertible versions that address the cars’ most serious flaw, the stingy glass area, steeply raked windshield and grave-deep seats that make it hard to see where the hell you’re going. Top-down aural pleasure is equally amplified, a Wagnerian V-8 aria from AMG’s mouth to your delighted ears.</P><P>The Mercedes won’t make it here in time for an illuminating dose of summer sun and UV radiation, but dealers and fans will bask in two versions this fall:  The standard AMG GT Roadster with 469 horsepower, and the wide-bodied AMG CT C Roadster with a bountiful 550 horses. Hold on to your designer hat, because the GT C combines a 196-mph top speed with an expected base price of about $160,000. Like their hardtop siblings, the Roadsters share the distinction of being designed entirely by AMG<STRONG>,</STRONG> Mercedes’ high-performance maestros in Affalterbach, Germany.</P></DIV><FIGURE class=""figure "" tabindex=""1""><DIV class=""figure-wrapper""><DIV class=""credit""><mark>Daimler AG</mark></DIV><DIV class=""caption-container""><P>Mercedes' open-roofed roadrunner takes on the Sonoran desert</P></DIV></DIV></FIGURE><DIV class=""articleFragment paragraph""><P>The GT C demonstrated its Porsche-baiting flash and dash by earning me a stiff speeding ticket from an Arizona sheriff, likely as enthralled by the Benz’ scorching yellow paint as by my radar-tripping 90-mph pace in a 65-mph zone. (Mercedes calls the AMG’s signature yellow paint “Solarbeam Yellow,” but this native Michigander can’t help but notice its uncanny resemblance to the maize in Michigan maize-and-blue). The sheriff and his partner were friendly enough, informing me that the really epic curves were just ahead on Route 89A, a cliff-dangling beauty of a road toward the old mining town of Jerome. “Just take it easy and watch your speed, because you were really flying,” one officer said.</P><P>“It’s this stupid car,” I replied helplessly, the citation already scorching my (guilty) fingertips. “It feels like it’s going 60 when you’re doing 90.”</P><P>“I’ll bet,” the officer said, grinning from below his flat-brimmed Mountie hat.</P></DIV><FIGURE class=""figure "" tabindex=""1""><DIV class=""figure-wrapper""><DIV class=""credit"">Lawrence Ulrich</DIV><DIV class=""caption-container""><P>Arizona's Route 89A winds like a snake, will bite if improperly cornered</P></DIV></DIV></FIGURE><DIV class=""articleFragment paragraph""><P>The same is surely true of the base model, the 469-horsepower, 188-mph GT Roadster. Our educated guess puts that one at roughly $125,000 to start. Mercedes’ pegs the GT’s 0-60 mph sprint at 4 seconds flat, compared with a blistering 3.7-seconds for the GT C. Both cars are powered by Benz’ rollicking, dry-sump-lubed 4.0-liter biturbo V-8, in tandem with the 7-speed AMG Speedshift dual-clutch transmission. Base GT's wind up 469 pound feet of torque. That GT C kicks that to 502 pound-feet, more than a Porsche 911 Turbo and close to the 516 pound-feet of the 911 Turbo S.</P><H2>Roadster adopts key features of 2018 GT R Coupe</H2><P>To better defend a $35,000 premium over the base model, the GT C version shares three key features with the upcoming, street-legal-racer GT R Coupe (no, not Nissan’s GT-R). Dramatically widened rear fenders accommodate a 2.25-inch wider rear axle track. The GT C in turn adopts marginally wider, Continental ContiSport 6 tires at the rear, at 305/30/ZR20 versus 295/30/ZR20’s for the GT. Secondly, the GT C’s standard active rear-steering unit can turn rear wheels up to 1.5 degrees. A pair of adjustable links replace fixed toe links on the rear axle, spurred by electromechanical actuators that aren’t connected to the steering column. At speeds below 62 mph (or 100 kph) rear wheels turn opposite the fronts for faster turn-in with fewer degrees of steering input. Breeze past 62 mph, and rear wheels steer in tandem with fronts to promote stability, with quicker buildup of lateral forces for faster directional changes. Finally, the GT C adopts an electronic limited-slip rear differential to minimize wheelspin and help the Benz exit corners faster than a teenager doing a dine-and-dash. The coupe makes do with a mechanical limited-slip diff.</P></DIV><FIGURE class=""figure "" tabindex=""1""><DIV class=""figure-wrapper""><DIV class=""credit""><mark>Daimler AG</mark></DIV><DIV class=""caption-container""><P>Back end still recalls Porsche 928, in a good way</P></DIV></DIV></FIGURE><DIV class=""articleFragment paragraph""><H2>Convertible top keeps things light and simple</H2><P>That GT C fairly feasted on desert asphalt between Phoenix and the spectacular red rocks of Sedona, while I soaked up sun for the first time after a long New York winter. Offered in black or red fabric – the latter contrasting beautifully with matte gray or mineral-black Anthracite paint -- the three-layer softtop opens or closes in a fleet 11 seconds, operated by a headliner switch. The Benz admirably defends against top-down wind noise, with passengers’ conversations and the rocking Burmester audio system both reasonably audible at an 75-mph cruise. And while it wasn’t needed on this gorgeous 85-degree day, Mercedes’ Airscarf seemed much more robust than I’ve experienced before, directing a sizzling stream of warm air from the integrated headrests onto occupants’ necks.</P></DIV><FIGURE class=""figure "" tabindex=""1""><DIV class=""figure-wrapper""><DIV class=""credit""><mark>Daimler AG</mark></DIV><DIV class=""caption-container""><P>Interior is gorgeous yet nearly as intimate as a Miata's</P></DIV></DIV></FIGURE><DIV class=""articleFragment paragraph""><P>After a smoking descent to the valley floor on Arizona’s spectacular Route 89A, the case was as open-and-shut as the roof: If the convertible gives up anything to the coupe’s crushing performance, you’d probably only notice by a minute margin of lap times on a racetrack, and not at all on public roads. Both models get a standard adaptive AMG sport suspension and switch-selectable performance exhaust, with <mark>carbon</mark>-ceramic brakes a key option. Four performance settings comprise Comfort, Sport, Sport Plus and Race, the latter with its a stonking Race Start launch-control function.</P></DIV><FIGURE class=""figure "" tabindex=""1""><DIV class=""figure-wrapper""><DIV class=""credit""><mark>Daimler AG</mark></DIV><DIV class=""caption-container""><P>Anthracite Gray or signature Solarbeam Yellow? Discuss.</P></DIV></DIV></FIGURE><DIV class=""articleFragment paragraph""><H2>Restyled Panamericana grille fronts all 2018 AMG GT's</H2><P>The GT Roadster adds just 120 pounds to the GT Coupe, largely due to thicker-gauge aluminum in the space frame along the door area; and an additional aluminum strut, hidden below the roof and fixed roll hoops, that links and stiffens the body. (A magnesium-and-aluminum roof structure does its own part to keep weight off). The mass variance is even more negligible between the GT C Roadster and the upcoming GT C Coupe – just 77 pounds, or the weight of a small, cute child – because that 2018 GT C Coupe adopts a standard, fixed panoramic roof that carries its own modest weight penalty. Mercedes hasn’t released official curb-weight specifications for U.S. models, but its European team pegs the GT Roadster at 3,516 pounds and GT C Roadster poundage at a somewhat chubby 3,660. How hairbreadth-close is the performance? The range-topping GT R Coupe tops out at 198 mph, just 1 mph quicker than the GT C Roadster. Coupe and convertible models will share in more newness come fall: A completely restyled front-end for 2018, including the so-called “Panamericana” grille whose thick vertical slats replace the single chrome bar and three-pointed-star of the original 2017 GT Coupe. At this point, I have to say, <A href=""http://www.thedrive.com/travel/590/write-the-road-rte-301-leads-to-buddha?iid=sr-link1"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">I like the old grille better.</A> Vitalis Enns, Mercedes-AMG’s shaved-headed designer, said that the aggressive shark snout, together with a new floating A-wing fascia, serve to visually lower and widen the car.As with a middle schooler fresh from the orthodontist, there’s no overlooking this metal-mouthed grin.</P><P>Functionally, Mercedes’ Airpanel tucks 14 active louvers behind the jail-bar grille, which can shutter in less than one second to limit aerodynamic drag, or swing open when the engine needs more cooling breeze. Yet the GT’s surfboard-sized snout is still more about style than anything else. Lift the hood, and you’ll see that most of the V-8 is shoved well behind the firewall; Mercedes could probably shave six inches off the front end and make it all fit. Inside, style and luxury are no issues, from beautiful porthole vents to sumptuous stitched black leather, glossy <mark>carbon</mark> fiber trim, AMG performance seats and the latest COMAND infotainment system. But that front-midship powertrain placement, which in turn demands an intrusively tall and blocky center console, helps explain the Mercedes’ ergonomic deficiencies.</P></DIV><FIGURE class=""figure "" tabindex=""1""><DIV class=""figure-wrapper""><DIV class=""credit""><mark>Daimler AG</mark></DIV><DIV class=""caption-container""><P><mark>Carbon</mark> ceramic brakes will cost you extra</P></DIV></DIV></FIGURE><DIV class=""articleFragment paragraph""><H2>Supercar style demands a few interior sacrifices</H2><P>As in the coupe, the wraparound intimacy of the cockpit is fine when you’re hauling ass. At other times, you get the sensation that the cabin wants to eat you whole and spit out the bones. Thick, Alcantara-clad front roof pillars, including a left-hander that aims at the driver’s forehead, impede the forward view, especially in hairpin turns. Footwells are short and narrow. My body tells me there’s just a skosh more space for knees, hips and elbows than a Mazda Miata, in a Mercedes whose exterior footprint is decisively larger. There’s zero storage behind the seats, not even a net or center cubby as in the Miata. The relatively tight quarters for bodies and gear point up the key competitive advantage of the two-plus-two Porsche 911 or even the far-pricier Aston Martin DB11, with their luggage-swallowing rear seats that can also accommodate children or grown-ups in a literal pinch. The convertible shrinks the coupe’s cargo space as well, especially by eliminating the hatch-like rear glass. Two soft-sided weekenders is the convertible’s absolute limit.</P></DIV><FIGURE class=""figure "" tabindex=""1""><DIV class=""figure-wrapper""><DIV class=""credit""><mark>Daimler AG</mark></DIV></DIV></FIGURE><DIV class=""articleFragment paragraph""><P>Of course, the Mercedes is positioned as an expensive, indulgent toy, with just-shy-of-supercar performance. If it’s grand-touring comfort and practicality you’re looking for, you’ll find it in the Mercedes SL-Class. The AMG GT’s major advantage? Pull into any hotel or restaurant lot, and valets and bystanders alike will go apeshit over the Benz. Between its half-century familiarity and ubiquity, any Porsche 911 within 100 yards is rendered invisible.</P><P>With its dizzying lineup expansion, Mercedes already offers more varied boxes than a supermarket cereal aisle. These flip-top Roadsters boost the AMG GT lineup to seven models (if one includes the GT3 race car) that include the GT, GT S, GT C and GT R coupes. That’s a lot of AMG GT’s to look at. The Roadsters, by far, are the best to look out of.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""has-ad-column""><DIV class=""articleFragment paragraph""><P><EM>Lawrence Ulrich,</EM> The Drive’s <EM>chief auto critic, is an award-winning auto journalist and former chief auto critic for</EM> The New York Times <EM>and</EM> Detroit Free Press<EM>.
