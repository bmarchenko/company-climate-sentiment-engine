A potential consequence of such failed attempts was</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y20e ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws76"">that only a few people believed that change was really</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y20f ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws167"">needed and was going to happen. A letter signed by the</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y210 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws2e"">vice-president, a company video with the chairman or an</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y211 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws71"">article in the company newsletter were clearly not enough.</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y212 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws7c"">Workers and managers had to feel it ‘‘in their bones’’, as it</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y213 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws4c"">happened at Riva/Ilva: ‘‘This time it is for real’’. ‘‘Our top</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y214 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws78"">management is not only involved and committed, but also</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y215 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws12c"">leading, monitoring and steering from close range’’. One</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y216 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws26"">of the participants: ‘‘We praised the day when our chairman</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y217 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 wse0"">climbed on stage and addressed workers and managers in</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y218 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws43"">the company, face to face.

One expressed the necessity of using</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y227 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws166"">‘‘clear lines’’ that enabled particular actions to refer to</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y228 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws105"">ultimate goals. Also, continuous feedback to all organiza-</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y229 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws43"">tional members was considered imperative. SSAB used the</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y22a ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws4c"">balanced scorecard to make the vision more concrete. This</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y22b ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws79"">instrument was used to monitor the actions from the per-</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y22c ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 wse4"">spective of the customer, the worker and the economic</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y22d ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws43"">objectives. The urgency of change was not self-evident to</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y22e ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 wse2"">many employees. Building a case for change implied, on</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y22f ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 wsd4"">the part of the ﬁrms, clarifying the dysfunctions of the</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y230 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws97"">existing organization.

The majority of the</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y23b ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws16d"">ﬁrms considered communication as an effective tool to</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y23c ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 wsd5"">stimulate a sense of urgency. In most cases, communication</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y23d ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws10e"">of painful facts acted as a shock therapy. In the develop-</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y23e ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws163"">ment phase, communication served rather as a steering</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y23f ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws9b"">and motivation tool. The change had to be <SPAN class=""ff5"">marketed.</SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y240 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws2d"">Whereas at the start of the change program most efforts</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y241 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws16e"">were of a ‘‘broadcasting’’ nature (carefully planned and</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y242 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws8c"">formulated messages sent to a broad audience), in the sec-</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y243 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws16f"">ond phase, during the organizational transformations, com-</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y244 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws170"">munication cascaded more ‘‘naturally’’ from one</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y245 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws5b"">organizational level to the next.

The relationship between management and unions,</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y250 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws1e"">shop stewards and works councils has been blurred in most</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y251 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 wsd"">companies, they claimed. Distrust has, in most ﬁrms, been</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y252 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 wsc1"">recognized as a main obstacle to be overcome in the change</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y253 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws124"">process. Trust could be built and earned by straightforward-</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y254 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 wsd7"">ness, by direct, personal encounters between (top) manage-</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y255 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 wse2"">ment and workers, and by competent action resulting in</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y256 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws100"">positive outcomes. Most ﬁrms claimed to have proceeded</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y257 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws35"">along these lines. The massive effort to inform employees</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y258 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 wsde"">about the reasons for change, about the changes themselves</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y259 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws108"">and about the accomplishments, can be regarded as ways of</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y25a ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws21"">building trust.

The ﬁrst strategy,</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y61 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws10e"">which contributes to repair of trust, is the direct involve-</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y62 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws93"">ment of senior management with all employees.

The second</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y64 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws117"">strategy is particularly aimed at rebuilding the strength</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y65 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 wsdb"">of HRM (<SPAN class=""fc3 ws18a"">Bowen and Ostroff, 2004</SPAN><SPAN class=""ws64"">). It entails the develop-</SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y66 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws16"">ment of two-way communication. Most of the ﬁrms began</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y67 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws19f"">their change programs with one-way communication</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y68 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws4a"">(broadcasting) to express the situation<SPAN class=""ff6 ls3"">Õ</SPAN><SPAN class=""ws49"">s urgency and to</SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y69 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws187"">justify far-reaching changes.

The most important roles related to organization and</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y7b ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 wsc1"">implementation of the change (rather than having a voice in</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y7c ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws10c"">the board decision to change). To <SPAN class=""ff5 ws8c"">organize </SPAN>the change pro-</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y7d ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws16b"">cess, a range of instruments was used: workshops, mass</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y7e ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws19b"">meetings, surveys, dialogues with unions and/or workers</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y7f ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws1aa"">councils, newly developed communication channels, and</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y80 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws57"">seminars for top management. The second key role con-</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y81 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws104"">cerned the more typical HRM measures to <SPAN class=""ff5"">implement </SPAN>the</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y82 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws1ab"">strategic changes, e.g. the introduction of multi-task</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y83 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws10c"">groups, job redesign by integrating operational and support</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y84 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws133"">jobs, training programs, coaching of supervisors and man-</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 xc he y85 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws32"">agement development schemes.

This stra-</SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y8a ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 wsfc"">tegic partner role proved especially strong in those ﬁrms</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y8b ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 wsd"">where dramatic changes (short strokes) took place.

At the same time, the process of restructuring,</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y2ec ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 wse4"">mergers and acquisitions has continued, with the recent</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y2ed ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws127"">take-overs by Asian companies as the most conspicuous fea-</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y2ee ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws1d"">ture. It would be interesting to see how HRM has co-evolved</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y2ef ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws83"">into the present situation. Have the long marches with their</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y2f0 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws140"">proactive and long-term perspective become the standard</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y2f1 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws127"">for these European ﬁrms? Or do bold strokes remain inevita-</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y2f2 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws166"">ble? The present study indicates that the engagement in</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y2f3 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws94"">long marches marks HR as a strategic partner in the accom-</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y2f4 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws90"">plishment of <mark>sustainable</mark> change. However, radical short-</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y2f5 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws75"">term interventions might be unavoidable under speciﬁc</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 he y2f6 ff4 fs7 fc2 sc0 ls0"">circumstances.</DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x17 h10 y2f8 ff4 fsa fc2 sc0 ls0 ws1b1"">Antila, E.

The transaction nearly triples Statoil's production in Brazil, with attractive break-evens and potential for additional value creation for both parties through the application of Statoil's expertise in improved oil recovery (IOR). The total consideration comprises an initial payment of USD 2.35 billion, plus additional contingent payments of up to USD 550 million</B><STRONG class=""hugin"">.</STRONG></P><P class=""hugin"">&quot;This transaction adds material and attractive long-term production to our international portfolio, further strengthening the position of Brazil as a core area for Statoil. We are also pleased to advance our strategic partnership with Petrobras by expanding our technical collaboration, sharing technology, competence and experience to increase oil and gas recovery,&quot; says Eldar Sætre, president and chief executive officer of Statoil.</P><P class=""hugin"">Roncador was the largest discovery offshore Brazil in the 1990s and is currently the third largest producing field in Petrobras' portfolio with around 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in place and an expected remaining recoverable volume of more than 1 billion boe. The ambition is to increase the recovery factor by at least 5 percentage points, bringing the total remaining recoverable volumes to more than 1,500 million boe.</P><P class=""hugin"">The field has been in production since 1999 with output, during November 2017, of around 240,000 barrels of oil per day plus around 40,000 boe per day of associated gas. The transaction increases Statoil's equity production in Brazil by around 175% to around 110,000 boe per day from around 40,000 boe per day. Petrobras retains operatorship and a 75% interest.</P><P class=""hugin"">In conjunction with the transaction, the two companies are entering into an agreement with the aim of maximising value creation and the longevity of the Roncador field. Statoil will leverage its IOR technology, competence and experience from the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) and elsewhere, and Petrobras its experience as the largest deep-water operator and pre-salt developer in the world. Several specific opportunities for increased recovery and value creation have already been identified.</P><P class=""hugin"">&quot;Strategic partnerships are an important part of our business plan and Statoil's knowledge and experience in increasing the level of oil recovery in mature fields will add value not only to our joint operations in Roncador, but to other mature fields in the Campos Basin, with huge potential to positively impact future production in the area,&quot; says Pedro Parente, chief executive officer of Petrobras.</P><P class=""hugin"">Petrobras and Statoil are partners in 13 areas in either the exploration or production phase, ten of which are located in Brazil and three abroad. The acquisition will strengthen Statoil as one of the biggest oil producers in Brazil, operating the Peregrino field and block BM-C-33, both in the Campos Basin, and the BM-S-8 block in the Santos Basin.</P><P class=""hugin"">&quot;We look forward to working with our partners to maximise the upside potential from the Roncador field. The combination of Statoil's experience in improved oil recovery and Petrobras' deep-water and pre-salt expertise will enable us to extend and increase production, and therefore value and cash flows, to the benefit of Brazil, both companies and the supplier industry&quot;, says Anders Opedal, Brazil's country manager.</P><P class=""hugin"">Statoil has been deploying its IOR expertise across its global portfolio and has achieved an average recovery rate on the NCS well above the worldwide industry average, with the ambition to increase further. Around 3,000 Statoil employees worldwide work on initiatives related to IOR. The projects for IOR collaboration between Statoil and Petrobras will be overseen by representatives from both companies.</P><P class=""hugin"">Statoil and Petrobras have also agreed that Statoil will have the option to utilise part of the capacity at Petrobras' Cabiúnas <A href=""/rohstoffe/eex-natural-gas-year-future"">Natural Gas</A> terminal to allow for the future development of BM-C-33, where both companies are partners and which contains the world class Pão de Açúcar discovery.</P><P class=""hugin"">This marks an important next step in developing Statoil's position in the Brazilian natural gas market which is on the verge of major transformation. Statoil has more than 35 years of experience in building gas value chains, as the second largest natural gas supplier in Europe and an operator of premium shale gas plays in the US onshore with mid- and downstream positions.</P><P class=""hugin"">Petrobras CEO Pedro Parente has come to meet Statoil CEO Eldar Sætre in Oslo for the signing on 18 December, which follows the Memorandum of Understanding agreed between the two companies in August 2016 and the Heads of Agreement in September 2017.</P><P class=""hugin"">The effective date for the Roncador transaction is 1 January 2018.

A multiobjective programming model which jointly minimizes costs, emissions, and employee injuries in a supply chain is first constructed. Using the weighted-sum approach with weights setting by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the model is solved by normalization of the minima of the three objectives. A numerical example is conducted to test the model. The results show that it is indeed possible to integrate environmental and social metrics in supply chain system optimization. Multiobjective optimization can balance the social, environmental, and economic performance. This paper presents a new multidimension perspective for optimizing supply chain; it will inspire practitioners to change their decision ideas and improve supply chain sustainability.</P><SPAN class=""end-abs""><H4 id=""sec1"">1. Introduction</H4><P><mark>Sustainable</mark> development is becoming a world-wide hot topic in academics and practice. “If everyone used energy and resources the same way we do in the Western World, we would need three more earths at least. And we have only one.” [<A href=""#B1"">1</A>]. The former Minister for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development in Sweden addressed one of the major challenges we have to face in the 21st century—the scarcity of resources. More and more countries, institutions, and businesses recognize that the world population has to change its behavior to tackle problems that might easily become or already are constraints to international growth. In a report for the OECD, Strange and Bayley [<A href=""#B2"">2</A>] draw up a great past in terms of economic growth with incomes having increased eightfold since 1820, but they also suggest that there are “clouds on the horizon.” Salim [<A href=""#B3"">3</A>] states that “un<mark>sustainable</mark> development has degraded and polluted the environment in such a way that it acts now as the major constraint followed by social inequity that limits the implementation of perpetual growth.” The bad effect of <mark>pollution</mark>, also on economic wealth, has been examined especially in the context of <mark>climate change</mark>. The <mark>Climate</mark> Vulnerability Monitor by the NGO DARA reveals the impact of global warming on every aspect of life [<A href=""#B4"">4</A>]. It estimates that in 2010 the global economy has to bear total losses of around 1.2 trillion dollars due to the <mark>carbon</mark> emission and <mark>climate change</mark>. Different from other consequences, those losses are also significant in the industrialized world [<A href=""#B4"">4</A>].</P><P>There are other driving factors, such as customer awareness, media interference or governmental regulations that push the development of <mark>sustainable</mark> solutions [<A href=""#B5"">5</A>]. For example, in 2005, the Emissions Trading System had been launched in the European Union. It covers more than 11,000 power stations and industrial plants in 31 countries. This “cap-and-trade” approach gives high-emitting industry sectors the choice to either cut down on <mark>pollution</mark> or to bear the cost of buying emission allowances [<A href=""#B6"">6</A>]. This is definitely an incentive for European companies to pursue greener production. Besides the environmental problem, corporate social responsibility is also a growing issue. In 2012, a TV news report about the working conditions in manufacturing sites for jeans in China triggered countrywide discussions in Germany [<A href=""#B7"">7</A>]. And this is just one media coverage amongst many. There are also many other events of media interfering <mark>sustainable</mark> development, such as, the German magazine “Wirtschaftswoche” denounced textile factories in Bangladesh [<A href=""#B8"">8</A>], the US newspaper “The New York Times” wrote about the human costs of an iPad [<A href=""#B9"">9</A>], and, even in China, the “China Daily” called for an improvement of migrant workers’ situation [<A href=""#B10"">10</A>]. Nowadays, consumers thereby are becoming more and more concerned about the sustainability of companies’ activities.</P><P>Under this international background of <mark>sustainable</mark> development, sustainability management becomes increasingly important, and supply chain management surely cannot be excluded from this stream of <mark>sustainable</mark> development. On the contrary, supply chain managers are significantly involved in companies’ operations and bear more and more responsibilities in essential decision making processes, such as the selection of suppliers, transport modes, or production methods during <mark>sustainable</mark> manufacturing [<A href=""#B11"">11</A>]. In academics, <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain management (SSCM) has become a new hot topic for research; more and more authors are researching the problem of <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain strategy and operations management.</P><P>While there is an abundance of supply chain models that integrates economic and environmental goals concerning green supply chain (e.g., [<A href=""#B12"">12</A>–<A href=""#B16"">16</A>]), there is only a few of them considering the social layer issues (e.g., [<A href=""#B17"">17</A>, <A href=""#B18"">18</A>]). Carter and Rogers [<A href=""#B19"">19</A>] also criticize that general management as well as the operations management literature often focuses on the ecological dimension of sustainability and neglects social aspects.</P><P>In the literature of the area of production and logistics system optimization, there are some authors who have studied the complex production-supply logistics systems; Ait-Alla et al. [<A href=""#B20"">20</A>] study the robust production planning in an apparel industry under demand uncertainty via conditional value at risk. Karimi et al. [<A href=""#B21"">21</A>] study a class of production networks of autonomous work systems with time varying delays in capacity changes. Mehrsai et al. [<A href=""#B22"">22</A>] address a pull-push flow strategy in a supply network and propose a novel solution for optimizing the pull side employing conwip system using metaheuristic and fuzzy system optimization method. Mehrsai et al. [<A href=""#B23"">23</A>] study production-logistics system using simulation method, in which a learning autonomous pallets’ concept is used in a discrete simulation model to analyze and compare several decentralized control strategies.</P><P>However, all those studies do not consider the social objectives. Using different previous research, in this paper, we take an iron and steel factory as case background, considering the above three <mark>sustainable</mark> factors, study the complex multiobjective optimization model of production-sourcing logistics system. In this model, several raw materials are supplied from different suppliers, and then the iron and steel factory produces products to meet customers demand. Through constructing a multiobjective programming model by concurrently considering social, environmental, and economic factors, we demonstrate the benefit of <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain system optimization based on multiple factors instead of single economic objective.</P><P>This paper is organized as follows. First, a definition of sustainability in general and <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain management in particular is developed based on the literature review. Then, based on existing research, an optimization model of <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain system based on multiobjective programming approach is constructed and, thirdly, the corresponding solution method is developed. Fourthly, a numerical example is used to demonstrate the application of the model. At last, conclusion and future research directions are summarized.</P><H4 id=""sec2"">2. Definition and Framework of <mark>Sustainable</mark> Supply Chain</H4><P><I>(</I><I>1) Sustainability.</I> The idea of sustainability goes back to the mid-ages. In 1713, Hanns Carl von Carlowitz, head of the Royal Mining Office in the Kingdom of Saxony, in order to meet the challenge of a predicted shortage of timber—the key resource of the time—requested that the number of trees that are cut down may not exceed the amount of new trees growing [<A href=""#B24"">24</A>]. This idea tells that the nature resource of the earth is limited, and human being should moderately utilize the nature resource.</P><P>In modern age, the discussion about sustainability was initiated in 1972 when the Club of Rome published its first report “Limits to growth” [<A href=""#B5"">5</A>]. One of the milestones in the development of the sustainability definition was a UN (United Nations) report commonly known as Brundtland Report, and the original name of the report was “Our common future” [<A href=""#B25"">25</A>]. It is notable to mention that the former Norwegian Prime Minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, shaped not only the name of this memorandum but the whole definition of sustainability for years to come [<A href=""#B25"">25</A>]. Even today, more than 30 years later, “development that meets the need of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs” (World Commission on Environment and Development [<A href=""#B25"">25</A>]) is still the basis for most definitions of sustainability.</P><P>One of the most famous literatures when it comes to sustainability is Elkington’s book “Cannibals with Forks: The Triple Bottom Line of the 21st Century”[<A href=""#B26"">26</A>]. He compares sustainability to a fork with three prongs. The three prongs stand for the economic, environmental, and social performance of an organization. The idea of the triple bottom line promotes the simultaneous optimization of all three dimensions. Carter and Rogers have transformed this idea into a figure (see Figure <A target=""_blank"" href=""fig1/"">1</A>) and conclude that “there are activities that organizations can engage in which not only positively affect the natural environment and society, but which also result in long-term economic benefits and competitive advantage for the firm”[<A href=""#B19"">19</A>].</P><DIV class=""fig""><DIV class=""groupcaption""><B>Figure 1: </B>The triple bottom line of sustainability [<A href=""#B19"">19</A>].</DIV></DIV><P>These three aspects of sustainability are sometimes also called 3 Ps: profit, planet, and people [<A href=""#B5"">5</A>]. Dyllick and Hockerts [<A href=""#B27"">27</A>] describe the triple bottom line as 3 different types of capital: economic, natural, and social capital. In order to reach corporate sustainability, they conclude that all three types of capital have to be optimized.</P><P>Nowadays, the notion of sustainability has been defined on a macroeconomic basis as well as in the sense of corporate sustainability [<A href=""#B26"">26</A>, <A href=""#B27"">27</A>]. In this paper, we will base on the idea of sustainability to construct the optimization model of <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain management.</P><P><I>(</I><I>2) <mark>Sustainable</mark> Supply Chain Management.</I> There is no consensus definition on the <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain management. Carter and Rogers [<A href=""#B19"">19</A>] define <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain management (SSCM) as follows.</P><P>The strategic, transparent integration and achievement of an organization’s social, environmental, and economic goals in the systemic coordination of key inter-organizational business processes for improving the long term economic performance of the individual company and its supply chains.</P><P>Tang and Zhou [<A href=""#B28"">28</A>] use the PPP (profit, people, and planet) approach to construct a <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain model (see Figure <A target=""_blank"" href=""fig2/"">2</A>). In Figure <A target=""_blank"" href=""fig2/"">2</A>, the economic dimension is depicted by the blue arrows (i.e., the central part of the figure, from the box of “producers” to the box of “supply chain” and the box of “consumers”), the green arrow represents the environmental problems (i.e., from the box of “wastes and emissions” to the box of “natural resource” in the figure) and the red arrow stands for social facets (i.e., from the box of “producers” to the box of “consumers”).</P><DIV class=""fig""><DIV class=""groupcaption""><B>Figure 2: </B>Supply chain integrated in the PPP ecosystem [<A href=""#B28"">28</A>].</DIV></DIV><P>All of the SSCM definitions have one thing in common: they emphasize the necessity to simultaneously consider all three dimensions within the supply chain; that is, while considering the economic performance of supply chain, improving social and environmental impact also has to be considered. Cetinkaya et al. [<A href=""#B29"">29</A>] employ a three-dimension metrics system to describe the sustainability, that is, social, economic, and environmental dimensions, and each of the dimensions is broken down into other three subdimensions (see Figure <A target=""_blank"" href=""fig3/"">3</A>). They state that an improvement in any of these subdimensions, without a negative effect on another subdimension, will ultimately lead to a more <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain.</P><DIV class=""fig""><DIV class=""groupcaption""><B>Figure 3: </B>Metric dimensions and subdimensions of sustainability [<A href=""#B29"">29</A>].</DIV></DIV><P>In order to make the <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain quantifiable, in this paper, we will follow the approach of Cetinkaya et al. [<A href=""#B29"">29</A>], as it is necessary to find and categorize metrics. According to this framework, we will construct a series of metrics of <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain, and then under these three objective dimensions—social, economic, and environmental dimensions, to construct a multiobjective programming model.</P><H4 id=""sec3"">3. Problem Definition and Modeling</H4><P>Before applying the mathematical optimization model, we first define the assumptions of the supply chain and then formulate the optimization problem.</P><H5 id=""sec3.1"">3.1. Supply Chain Model and Problem Definition</H5><P>The optimization problem proposed in this paper is simulated from the production facility’s perspective with only one period of time under consideration. In the model, a production facility produces one type of output, which is shipped to a group of customers. The raw materials are sourced from a finite number of suppliers. The suppliers ship the raw materials via different transport modes to the production facility.</P><P>For the optimization of the supply chain, several assumptions are made as follows.<SPAN class=""list""><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(1)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">The supply is organized in a just-in-time manner, so that the effect of incoming items inventory can be neglected.</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(2)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">The ordered quantities of all raw materials will meet the needs of the production.</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(3)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">There is more than one type of raw materials sourced from several suppliers.</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(4)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">The production facility, suppliers, and transportation options have capacity constraints.</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(5)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">All suppliers together can fulfill the ordered quantities needed for production and meet the demand of customers.</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(6)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">The demand of the customers is known and the production facility is able to satisfy the demand.</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(7)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">Outgoing items inventory will remain insignificantly small and is therefore neglected.</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(8)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">Transportation costs depend on the distance from suppliers to production facility, as well as on the quantity shipped.</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(9)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">Production emissions depend on the chosen production method, as well as the produced quantity, while transportation emissions are dependent on the shipped quantity of the respective material and the distance from the suppliers to the production facility.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P>The proposed model gives answers to the following questions (established as decision variables).<SPAN class=""list""><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(i)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">How much quantity of the respective raw material should be ordered from which supplier?</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(ii)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">How much quantity of a raw material should be shipped using what transport mode from the respective supplier to the production facility?</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(iii)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">Which production method should be chosen?</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P>Based on viewpoint of <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain, the optimization model of supply chain includes three objectives: economical, environmental, and social objectives. Subsequently, the three dimensions should be optimized simultaneously. According to the subdimensions of a <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain presented in Cetinkaya et al. [<A href=""#B29"">29</A>], several metrics can be chosen to quantify the three aspects under consideration. Due to the limited space of the paper, therefore, for each dimension, only one metric will be selected to measure the supply chain’s performance in the respective field. For the sake of computation convenience, the chosen indicators should be simple, understandable, easy to reproduce, comparable, complementary to regulatory programs, cost-effective in data collection, stackable and scalable, useful as a management tool, and protective of company information [<A href=""#B30"">30</A>].</P><P>The first objective is to achieve economic sustainability. The three subdimensions of economic sustainability are quality, efficiency, and responsiveness. As for Cetinkaya et al.’s [<A href=""#B29"">29</A>] statement, efficiency is “the most familiar dimension for all managers” (page 61). This is also reflected by Székely and Knirsch [<A href=""#B30"">30</A>], who study the metrics used in 20 different companies’ annual reports and sustainability reports. There are several measures for efficiency: utilization, productivity, cost reduction, and service level. For the purpose of this paper and under the assumptions, minimizing costs will be chosen to represent the economic dimension. The cost of the production facility is composed of production costs, transportation costs, and material costs for the sourced raw materials.</P><P>The environmental dimension consists of the following components: emissions, natural resources utilization and waste, and recycling [<A href=""#B29"">29</A>]. Tang and Zhou [<A href=""#B28"">28</A>], as well as Dekker et al. [<A href=""#B11"">11</A>], pinpoint that one of the most important ways to estimate environmental impact is the measurement of emissions and <mark>pollution</mark>. This is the fact due to “more stringent government regulations and increasing awareness of environmental protection among consumers and society” ([<A href=""#B28"">28</A>], page 591). The two major sources of emission in supply chains are production operations and transportation. Therefore the environmental objective in the model will be assessed using the emissions of the production method and the transportation options. As shown by Daniel et al. [<A href=""#B31"">31</A>], <mark>pollution</mark> can be classified into three categories: water, air, and soil <mark>pollution</mark>. If applicable, harm to all three areas should be considered.</P><P>Last but not least, probably the most difficult part is the social dimension. Health and safety, employees, and noise are the three subdimensions determined by Cetinkaya et al. [<A href=""#B29"">29</A>]. One of the most commonly adapted metric in this field is the accident and illness number, or rather the accident/illness number in relation to working hours [<A href=""#B30"">30</A>]. This measure will be taken as a basis and modified to accommodate the severity of different accidents and illnesses.</P><H5 id=""sec3.2"">3.2. Mathematical Formulation of the Model</H5><P>Having completed the general model description and problem introduction, we can now formulate the problem. At first, indices and variables will be defined, followed by the construction of the objective functions and the constraint functions.</P><H6 id=""sec3.2.1"">3.2.1. Indices and Notations</H6><P><SPAN class=""list""><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-content"">: cost per unit of raw material bought from supplier </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-content"">: hours of work for one unit of product under production method ;</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-content"">: depreciation per unit of product, if production method  is chosen;</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-content"">: utility cost per unit of product, if production method  is chosen;</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-content"">: quantity of products produced in units (equals demand of product);</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-content"">: cost for transportation per kilometer of one unit of raw material  with transport mode </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""list""><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-content""> per km and unit of raw material , if transport mode </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-content""> per unit of product, if production method  is chosen.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""list""><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-content"">: number of injuries in severity class , if production method </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN class=""list""><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-content""> for one unit of product.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><H6 id=""sec3.2.2"">3.2.2. Objective Functions</H6><P><I>(</I><I>1) Economic Objective.</I> As mentioned above, the economic objective will be included by minimizing the costs within the supply chain. The production costs are assumed to be mainly labor costs, depreciation costs (for the machinery), and utility costs. That is,</P><P>Minimize  = Material cost + Production cost + Transportation cost,
										</P><P><I>(</I><I>2) Environmental Objective.</I> The environmental dimension is optimized by minimizing emissions within the supply chain, that is, <mark>pollution</mark> created by transportation and by production. That is,</P><P>Minimize  = Transportation emissions + Production emissions,
										</P><P><I>(</I><I>3) Social Objective.</I> The foundation for the social objective function is the injury/illness incidence rate used by the American Bureau of Labor Statistics [<A href=""#B32"">32</A>], which is formulated as</P><P>Incidence rate = (Number of injuries and illnesses * 200,000)/Employee hours worked.</P><P>The 200,000 hours in the formula represents the equivalent of 100 employees working 40 hours per week, 50 weeks per year, and provides the standard base for the incidence rates. The formula includes all nonfatal work-related injuries and illnesses that are recordable.</P><P>For the purpose of this paper, the formula will be amended to include the severity of injuries and illnesses. To achieve this, it is proposed that all injuries/illnesses will be categorized according to the days absent from work. The injuries/illnesses that are less severe will be given a low severity level, while the highest rank will be work-related fatalities. For example injuries/illnesses could be ranked as follows (see Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab1/"">1</A>).</P><DIV class=""fig"" id=""tab1""><DIV class=""groupcaption""><B>Table 1: </B>Severity classes of work-related injuries/illnesses.</DIV></DIV><P>To represent the severity of the injuries/illnesses, an exponential function will be applied. The exponential function can show that the higher the class, the more unfavorable an incidence. In this way, the model can guide the decision maker (in our case the company) to employ production methods that will especially decrease the danger of severe injuries or illnesses. On the other hand, minor incidences become acceptable to a certain degree. Largely those small accidents (like cuts or tripping over) are most probably not even preventable.</P><P>In the example, cases that are in category 4 will therefore be included in the injury/illness incidence rate with factor 1, while incidents in lower classes are less weighted and occurrences in higher categories become more important (see Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab2/"">2</A>).</P><DIV class=""fig"" id=""tab2""><DIV class=""groupcaption""><B>Table 2: </B>The exponential severity function.</DIV></DIV><P>According to this, the third objective function can be modeled, which includes the rephrased injury/illness incidence rate as follows:
										</P><H6 id=""sec3.2.3"">3.2.3. Constraints</H6><P>Consider that
										</P><P>The first constraint (<A href=""#EEq4"">4</A>) establishes the assumption that the quantities of a raw material ordered at all suppliers together have to meet the needs of the production. Besides, the capacity of the chosen production method has to be able to fulfill the customers’ demands as constraint (<A href=""#EEq4"">5</A>). Constraints (<A href=""#EEq4"">6</A>) and (<A href=""#EEq4"">7</A>) show that the shipped quantities have to equal the ordered quantities, individually for each supplier and as a sum. Constraints (<A href=""#EEq4"">8</A>), (<A href=""#EEq4"">9</A>), and (<A href=""#EEq4"">10</A>) display the capacity limits of the suppliers and the transportation modes. Moreover, the production method variable can only take a value of 0 or 1, which is the constraint (<A href=""#EEq4"">11</A>). The other two decision variables must be nonnegative, which is shown in constraints of (<A href=""#EEq4"">12</A>) and (<A href=""#EEq4"">13</A>).</P><H4 id=""sec4"">4. Solution Method</H4><P>Now that we have compiled all the objectives and constraints, the solution method can be studied more thoroughly. As introduced in the literature review section, the weighted sum model will be used to solve the multiobjective optimization problem. The weighted sum model has the following general form [<A href=""#B33"">33</A>]:
						</P><P>For our model, this general form can be reformulated into

						</P><P> is the weight assigned by the decision maker and  is the normalization factor. Thus, before the optimization problem can be solved, weights and normalization factors have to be computed.</P><H5 id=""sec4.1"">4.1. Weights Setting</H5><P>There are various methods to model a decision maker’s preferences into weights. One of the most famous methods is the AHP method, which was first introduced by Saaty [<A href=""#B34"">34</A>]. AHP stands for analytic hierarchy process; it is a method for scaling weights of the elements in each level of a hierarchy with respect to an element (i.e., a criterion or objective) of the next higher level [<A href=""#B35"">35</A>].</P><P>In order to set the weights of objectives, in our case, we assume that<SPAN class=""list""><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(i)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">the economical performance (factor 1) is slightly more important than the environmental performance (factor 2) of the supply chain;</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(ii)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">the economical performance is moderately more important than the social performance (factor 3);</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(iii)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">the environmental performance is slightly more important than the social performance (factor 2).</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P>Based on this assumption, the weights for the different objectives can be derived through calculating the eigenvector of the evaluation matrix (see Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab3/"">3</A>) (the detail procedure of AHP is omitted).</P><DIV class=""fig"" id=""tab3""><DIV class=""groupcaption""><B>Table 3: </B>Weights for the <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain objectives.</DIV></DIV><P>According to the calculated weights, the optimization problem (<A href=""#EEq17"">17</A>) can be established:
								</P><H5 id=""sec4.2"">4.2. Normalization</H5><P>Last but not least, the objective functions have to be normalized. Mausser [<A href=""#B33"">33</A>] proposes three different methods of normalization:<SPAN class=""list""><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(i)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">normalization by the magnitude of the objective function at the initial point ;</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(ii)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">normalization by the minimum of the objective functions;</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-label"">(iii)</SPAN><SPAN class=""list-content"">normalization by the difference of the optimal values in the Nadir and Utopia points.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P>Although Mausser [<A href=""#B33"">33</A>] states that the normalization using the Nadir and Utopia points might render the best results, for the purpose of this paper, the more simple method of applying the minimum of the objective function will be used. As neither of the objective functions’ minima will equal zero, this method is acceptable. In this case, the normalization factors will be calculated by

Numerical Example</H4><P>After having formulated and scalarized the multiobjective optimization problem, we can now continue with testing the effectiveness of the model using example. The simulated production facility produces steel, for which the two main inputs are iron ore and coking coal. Within the time period under consideration, the steel mill has a hypothetical output of 500,000 tons of steel. It will be assumed that the site is located in Central Europe. Potential suppliers for iron ore are located in India, Brazil, and Australia, while suppliers for coking coal can be found in Australia, USA, and Canada. Those countries are, respectively, the biggest exporting nations. The possible transportation modes comprise either a combination of ship and rail or a combination of ship and truck. Last but not least, the company can choose from three different production methods, with the assumption that the first one (PM1) is the cheapest, the second one is the safest (PM2), and the third one is the most environmental friendly (PM3).</P><H5 id=""sec5.1"">5.1. Setting Parameters</H5><P>Before solving the model, we need to set parameters for the model. These parameters comprise the cost parameters, pollutant emissions parameters, injury parameters, and constraint parameters.</P><H6 id=""sec5.1.1"">5.1.1. Cost Parameters</H6><P>At first, the parameters constituting costs have to be established. As demonstrated in the model, costs comprise material, transportation, and production costs.</P><P><I>(</I><I>1) Material Costs.</I> The estimations for the material costs are based on the development of prices on the commodity exchange for iron ore and coal over the last few months [<A href=""#B36"">36</A>]. For different suppliers, located in different countries, the material prices may be different. Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab4/"">4</A> lists estimations of prices for iron ore and coking coal depending on suppliers, that is, .</P><DIV class=""fig"" id=""tab4""><DIV class=""groupcaption""><B>Table 4: </B>Material prices for iron ore and coking coal .</DIV></DIV><P><I>(</I><I>2) Transportation Costs.</I> In our model, the transportation cost parameter  denotes the cost for transportation per kilometer of one unit raw material  with transport mode  from supplier . For simplification, we assume that transportation costs are only related to the transportation mode. Beresford et al. [<A href=""#B37"">37</A>] have investigated the prices of multimodal supply chains of iron ore between Australia and China. The prices used for our simulation were derived from their study, taking into consideration the average distance traveled by ship and the average distance traveled by rail or truck.

At first, the depreciation of machines and equipment has to be considered. The higher the initial cost of acquisition, the higher the cost for depreciation. Besides, utility costs arise in the production processes also have to be included. Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab7/"">7</A> lists the parameters of depreciation of machine for different production methods, that is, . Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab8/"">8</A> shows the utility cost per unit of product if production method  is chosen, that is, </P><DIV class=""fig"" id=""tab7""><DIV class=""groupcaption""><B>Table 7: </B>Depreciation of machines ().</DIV></DIV><DIV class=""fig"" id=""tab8""><DIV class=""groupcaption""><B>Table 8: </B>Utility costs in steel production ().</DIV></DIV><P>Additionally, labor costs contribute towards production costs. In a less automated production environment, more manual labor will be required (production method 1, i.e., PM1). Technical advanced production method on the other hand would reduce the labor hours required to produce a ton of product, through increased productivity (production method 3, i.e., PM3). The hourly wages will be estimated with $20 based on German base rates for steel workers (IG Metall [<A href=""#B39"">39</A>]). Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab9/"">9</A> shows the labor hours required to produce one unit product for three production methods.</P><DIV class=""fig"" id=""tab9""><DIV class=""groupcaption""><B>Table 9: </B>Labor hours required to produce one ton of steel ().</DIV></DIV><H6 id=""sec5.1.2"">5.1.2. <mark>Pollution</mark> Parameters</H6><P>The second objective of the mathematical model is the minimization of <mark>pollution</mark> emissions, including emissions in the production and transportation.</P><P><I>(</I><I>1) Production Emissions. </I>The first part of supply chain pollutant emissions considered in the model is the production emissions.

Model Solutions</H5><P>The model is mixed integer linear problem with integer variable , continuous variables  and , the Solver type is Branch and Bound Solver of LINGO 12.0. Global optimization solution is obtained in 3 seconds CPU time at the computer configuration as: Intel Core i7-2600CPU, 3.4GHz, 4.00RAM, and 32bit operation system. For solving the model, it has to be run independently for each objective to compute the minima for normalization (5.1, 5.2, and 5.3).<SPAN class=""list""><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-content""> = 236,728,200;</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-content""> = 370783.8 (emissions are scaled in tons);</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""list-item""><SPAN class=""list-content""> = 4.980914.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P>Using the proposed multiobjective optimization model, the production facility’s optimal decision would be to choose production method PM2. Raw materials order quantities from difference suppliers are presented in Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab16/"">16</A> and the shipped quantities of transportation modes are displayed in Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab17/"">17</A>.</P><DIV class=""fig"" id=""tab16""><DIV class=""groupcaption""><B>Table 16: </B>Order quantities of iron ore and coking coal from the different suppliers.</DIV></DIV><DIV class=""fig"" id=""tab17""><DIV class=""groupcaption""><B>Table 17: </B>Raw material quantities shipped via different transportation modes.</DIV></DIV><P>Those solutions for the decision variables will lead to total costs of $243,701,800 (cost per ton of steel $487.4). Furthermore a total of 391,699.5 tons of pollutants are emitted, with production accounting for 275,478.8 tons and transportation for 116,220.8 tons. The injury and illness incidence rate will be equal to 4.879263.</P><H5 id=""sec5.3"">5.3. Discussion of Results</H5><P>First and foremost, the results of the numerical example show that the constructed model is indeed feasible and effective. This is the most important finding. Beyond that, one can draw even more conclusions from the solutions.</P><P>Firstly, it is revealed that a multiobjective optimization approach presents different results from the single objective functions alone. For example, production method PM1 is chosen when the economic objective () is minimized independently. However, when the multiple objective optimization model is applied, production method PM2 is identified as the optimal production method. The same outcome can be found when examining the shipped quantities. If only costs are considered, the truck will be chosen much more frequently. If the environmental performance is added to the model, on the contrary, railway transportation becomes the favourable option (see Table <A target=""_blank"" href=""tab17/"">17</A>).</P><P>Secondly, one can learn from the results that a multiobjective optimization model makes it possible for companies to accept reasonably higher costs, if other factors are taken into consideration. Hence, the minimum of costs is at $236,728,200, but the final amount of money spent in the supply chain equals an amount of $243,701,800. Those slightly higher costs are the price one has to pay for a safer and more ecological production and transportation. Still, if the costs would rise enormously, making the company economical uncompetitive, the bad economic performance would outweigh the other factors and the multiple objective optimization model would compute different results. This is the consequence of the simultaneous consideration of all three dimensions.</P><P>Lastly, the numerical example enlightens the importance of the social dimension. As mentioned before, corporate social responsibility has widely been neglected in operational research literature so far. Incorporating the employee safety into the multiple objective optimization model leads to a surprising result. Through the exponential function, production methods, such as PM1, that have a higher risk of fatalities or severe injuries, become unacceptable. Even production method PM3, which produces much less emissions, is unfavourable compared to PM2. Due to a better incidence rate on the one hand (compared to PM1 and PM3) and lower costs on the other hand (compared to PM3), PM2 is chosen in the multiple objective optimization model. Hence, clearly the constructed model adds information to a company’s decisions and can therefore reach different results, which can lead to improved supply chains from a sustainability perspective.</P><H4 id=""sec6"">6. Conclusion</H4><P><mark>Sustainable</mark> supply chain has become one important operations strategy for corporate competition, especially for large international corporations. Many firms have an annual report of CSR (corporate social responsibility). Under this background, it is necessary to incorporate CSR into supply chain optimization model. This paper addresses this problem, incorporates the three pillars of sustainability—economic, environmental, and social dimensions—into a supply chain optimization model. The purpose is to give supply chain managers a tool for decision making that is not only based on reducing costs or maximizing profit but also focuses on environmental protection and social responsibility. Research result shows that this idea is feasible.</P><P>Naturally, there are also certain deficiencies in the model, mainly resulting from the limited scope of the work. Some improvement works can be done to enhance the application value of the model. Firstly, more metrics for each of the dimensions might be considered to better reflect the reality. Also the model might be extended to accommodate more than one period and/or uncertainty in demand. From a mathematical viewpoint, testing different multiobjective solution methods might lead to better or more reliable results, as the weighted sum model yields problems, if nonconvex Pareto curves exist. Further enhancements could be made by using the difference of Nadir and Utopia point to normalize the objective functions.</P><P>Despite the described shortcomings, the existing simple model has already been proven to be effective. The program has shown that including different criteria might lead to changes in making choices. For example, when only considering costs, production method PM1 would have been chosen. But when the model also comprises the other two dimensions, production method PM2 is selected. Thus, including sustainability criteria into a company’s decision making is not extremely arduous or unrealistic. Considering the pressure from environment and society, corporations should make amends to their existing decision support systems. Bearing in mind new governmental regulations, the cost of <mark>climate change</mark> or the increasing awareness of customers of environmental protection and social responsibility, corporations should give up a pure focus on profit maximization. In the long-run, <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain models will certainly pay off, even though it might initially involve expensive investments. As introduced in the literature review, multiobjective optimization is able to process more information than a conventional single-objective method. Thus, using multicriteria decision model might eventually lead to improved choices. A multiobjective model like the one introduced in this paper can provide guidance to supply chain managers in a time when circumstances are changing quickly.</P><H4>Conflict of Interests</H4><P>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</P><H4>Acknowledgment</H4><P>This paper is funded by NSFC (Grant no. 71372154).</P></SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""xml-content""><H4>References</H4><OL><LI id=""B1"">M.

But after championing the Kyoto Protocol and taking the lead on action against global warming, European Union nations have been struggling to turn their good intentions into viable <mark>climate</mark> policies.</P><P>Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the leader of Europe’s Greens, says that while European integration is still a model for the world, it is weakening steadily. During a visit to the Center for Latin American Studies on September 29, Cohn-Bendit said that despite what he called Europe’s unwillingness to buck U.S. power, it had the potential to join with Latin America to pursue multilateralism and low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy policies.</P><P>“The Europeans with Latin America have to start what could be a feasible coalition with feasible laws that they can reach,” he told an audience of about 300. “The problem of this is [whether] the Europeans, in contradiction with what happened in Copenhagen, are really ready to organize themselves, to take the lead in the discussion, not just wait for the American president.”</P><P>Cohn-Bendit’s prescription was a sign that as the United States remains wracked with indecision about how — or whether — to do anything about <mark>climate change</mark>, Europe is having its own moments of angst.</P><TABLE style=""width: 37%;"" border=""0"" align=""left""><TBODY><TR><TD> </TD></TR><TR class=""caption""><TD style=""text-align: center;""><P>Daniel Cohn-Bendit addresses a 1968 meeting at the Gare de l’Est, Paris. (Photo by AFP/Getty Images.)</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>He sharply criticized Europe’s failure to break from Uncle Sam’s embrace and take the lead in the UN <mark>climate</mark> negotiations in Copenhagen in December 2009.</P><P>“In Copenhagen, the big negotiations on <mark>climate</mark>, it was a catastrophe,” he said. “Why? Because the Europeans didn’t have the guts, the organization to lead. The Americans — Obama was afraid of Congress, so he didn’t do anything. The Chinese — even if they do [support a common <mark>climate</mark> strategy], they had one idea — that whatever we do, nobody can and should control us.”</P><P>Cohn-Bendit is one of the most iconic, cosmopolitan figures of the European left, playing a key role in both France and Germany. </P><P>He was born in 1945 in southern France to German-Jewish parents who had fled Nazism. Later, as an anarchist student leader in Paris, he became one of the central figures in the Paris student uprising and general strike of 1968. He was widely known as “Dany le Rouge” — “Danny the Red” — a description of both his politics and his red hair. The French government attempted to expel him from the country, leading students to take up the chant, “Nous sommes tous des Juifs allemands” (“We are all German Jews”).</P><P>In the following years, he settled in Germany and became a leader of that country’s “autonomist” movement, which blended anarchism and Marxism. Since 1994, Cohn-Bendit has been elected alternately as European Parliament representative of the German Greens, then the French Greens, and once again the German Greens — the only person to have been elected to that body from more than one country. </P><P>Along the way, Cohn-Bendit managed to anger both the right and left wings for his mix of radicalism and realism — from the right, for his backing of open immigration, the legalization of soft drugs and the abandonment of nuclear power, and from the left for his support for free-market economic policies and for European military intervention in Bosnia and Afghanistan.</P><P>Currently known as “Danny the Green,” he is co-president of the European Greens/European Free Alliance in the European Parliament. Yet he told his Berkeley audience that he is disappointed at Europe’s decision to bow to pressure from industrial lobbies by creating a cap-and-trade system that affects only the power-generating sector rather than all business sectors. He was quizzed pointedly about this and other European weaknesses from questioners posting via Internet.</P><P>“We are in the fringe of a backlash,” he admitted in response to a question from Rafael Fernández de Castro, special adviser for international affairs to Mexican President Felipe Calderón. “The big corporations and trade unions are working together to say, ‘the crisis is too big, we have first to resolve the economic and financial crisis, and then we will see what we can do to resolve the ecological crisis.’ I think this is a danger.”</P><P>Cohn-Bendit cast the stakes in dire terms: </P><P>It’s insane logic. I think that in the <mark>climate</mark> crisis, with the ecological crisis, we are slowly understanding that our way of production, our way of economy, is destroying the planet. If we destroy the planet, what will be the end?</P><P style=""text-align: center;""><SPAN class=""caption"">A ThyssenKrupp facility in Germany covered in thin-film solar material. (Photo courtesy of Stan Ovshinsky.)</SPAN></P><P>Cohn-Bendit echoed his own uneasy experience trying to act as a bridge between radical and environmentalist wings of the French-German left. “With the ecological crisis, the mantra of the workers movement has to change,” he said. “And because there are jobs that people have that they will lose. And their way of production is changing … coal mines, and all the ‘green coal’ rhetoric, also from Obama, is rubbish. Green coal doesn’t exist. Coal is black. Nobody has seen green coal. Neither has Obama.”</P><P>He cast Europe’s dilemma as a tug of war between nation-states and regional government on a wide variety of topics.</P><P>“With this financial crisis, we must decide: do we have a national strategy of regulation of financial markets or do we have a European strategy? In the ecological crisis, do we have national solutions or do we have a European solution? And with <mark>climate change</mark>, do we have a national or European solution?”</P><P>Cohn-Bendit added that only by regionwide cooperation can the economy be adapted to a high-tech, low-<mark>carbon</mark> future. “We see in Europe that the green movement’s electoral results are growing. So you have a growing sensitivity in Europe that Europe should take the lead and not permit the backlash. Because the ecological transformation of the economy is the key of modernity. You will be an industrial leading nation, or part of the world, if you are leading in the ecological industry, because this is the industry of tomorrow.”</P><P>Ricardo Lagos, former president of Chile and currently Special Envoy on <mark>Climate Change</mark> for the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, sent a question asking whether Europe is truly capable of reaching its current <mark>climate</mark> commitments, known as the “three 20s” — increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent, reducing greenhouse gases by 20 percent and increasing renewable energy generation by 20 percent, all by the year 2020.</P><P>“Our position in the European Greens is that Europe is capable of doing the three 30s,” Cohn-Bendit said. “This is the fight that we have with the majority of European governments now. They say we can go to three-30 [only] if the rest of world will go to this, too. And our argument is that Europe, with the United States, is one of the most responsible for the <mark>climate</mark> problem, so we should go to three-30. And if we go to three-30, we will have the influence we need to push the Americans and others to go more rapidly.”</P><P>But Daniel Kammen, a professor in UC Berkeley’s Energy and Resources Group and now the World Bank’s newly appointed chief of renewable energy and energy efficiency, pressed Cohn-Bendit on whether his three-30 vision was politically feasible.</P><P>“I want a <mark>carbon</mark> tax,” Cohn-Bendit replied, mentioning the measure that many policy experts on both sides of the Atlantic view as most efficient at cutting emissions, yet one that remains politically unpalatable. “Europe has to impose a <mark>carbon</mark> tax. The more you produce <mark>carbon</mark>, you have to pay your tax. This is the way of regulation. A <mark>carbon</mark> tax will push in Europe [<mark>carbon</mark>] reduction.” But he admitted that such policies would require a seismic shift in European politics. </P><P>“This is a political decision,” he said, emphasizing his hope that the expected national elections in France and Germany in 2012 and 2013, respectively, will result in left-Green coalition governments that would forcefully advocate for European adoption of a <mark>carbon</mark> tax and more aggressive emissions targets.</P><P>Cohn-Bendit accused the United States of resting on the laurels of its military-space accomplishments and allowing other nations to take the lead in developing clean technology industries.</P><P>“The United States, in all military technology you are at the top of the world, but in the rest, you are a third-world country,” he said. “This is what I want to explain to the United States: you are completely backwards. If you [want to] have high-speed trains, you will buy them from France or Germany or China, but they won’t be American. Because you lived 30 years on the moon. You only got there once, you know, but you stayed there.”</P><P>Cohn-Bendit did not spare Latin American govern-ments from his criticism, however.</P><P style=""text-align: center;""><SPAN class=""caption"">Windmills stand alongside nuclear power plants in France’s Tricastin Nuclear Power Center. (Photo by Jean-Louis Zimmermann.)</SPAN></P><P>“One of the big problems of Latin America is that the leading nations, on one side, they have taken ecological steps, they did it on the Amazon, but on the other side, like biofuels, they got completely mad. In Latin America, because you have countries like Venezuela with a lot of oil, the countries didn’t get to [the] core of the problem, with some exceptions like Costa Rica.”</P><P>Responding to a question from Martha Delgado, the environment policy chief of Mexico City, he also offered hope for autonomous action by city governments around the world. Cohn-Bendit advocated a “coalition of the cities for reduction of emission of CO­2” He added, “if this coalition continues and the cities gave common benchmarks, it is one of the possibilities of arriving to global reduction of emissions.”</P><P>But despite his biting critiques of governments in Europe and around the world, Cohn-Bendit waxed lyrical about the potential of multinational integration.</P><P>The European integration process is a “dream of rivers,” Cohn-Bendit said, noting that Europe’s first barrier to drop was the Rhine, between historic enemies France and Germany. Then came the Oder, between Germany and Poland. “Now there’s not any more a border where people are shot,” he said. “You could continue to have this dream, the dream of Bosporus, to get Turkey in the European Union. This is highly controversial in Europe. But I think that it wasn’t Obama who invented ‘yes we can,’ it was the Europeans. They invented ‘yes we can overcome everything.’”</P><P>“Why do we need Europe? We need Europe because we need a multilateral world,” Cohn-Bendit said. He then concluded his talk on a wistful, ambiguously modest tone. </P><P>“So I still think Europe is still a dream. Worthwhile, I hope.”</P><P><EM>Daniel Cohn-Bendit is Co-President of the European parliamentary group Greens/European Free Alliance. He spoke for CLAS on September 29, 2010.</EM></P><P><EM>Robert Collier is a visiting scholar at the Center for Environmental Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley.

Therefore, dieless single-point incremental forming supported by induction heating was introduced. When a HCT980C steel part was studied, it was observed that the geometrical accuracy increased by forming using a 15 kW induction power, whereas a high deviation in profile geometry was observed by forming using a 5 kW induction power. The forming forces decreased by 66.63% compared with those resulting from forming at room temperature. At the same time, the HCT980C steel part cracked and failed to reach its designed depth when forming at room temperature. Regulating the tensile strength and hardness of the formed part and preventing their reduction was achieved by increasing the feed rate continuously as a function of the formed part’s growing depth. Moreover, the distribution of the induction heating temperature was reduced by introducing the new forming strategy. A cone wall angle of 70° was flexibly formed from a HCT980C steel sheet when the new strategy was applied.</DIV></SECTION><DIV id=""html-keywords""><DIV class=""html-gwd-group""><DIV id=""html-keywords-title"">Keywords:</DIV>

Introduction</H2><DIV class=""html-p"">Dieless single-point incremental sheet metal forming (SPIF) by a tool having a single point of contact is a highly adaptable process whereby the part is formed by the movement of a hemispherical tool along a characterized path. SPIF technology is different from other sheet metal forming methods, such as spinning, piercing, deep drawing, and bending. The mechanism of SPIF is plastic deformation caused by directing a forming tool via a path on the sheet metal using a computer numerical control (CNC) machine [<A href=""#B1-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">1</A>].</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">Since SPIF is a dieless process, it is suitable to form complicated prototype profiles within a short period at low cost. The most popular parts that were made by SPIF have been used in aerospace or medical applications [<A href=""#B2-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">2</A>]. Due to the feasibility shown by SPIF, new applications were presented, such as applying heat in forming hard-to-form, high-strength sheet metals.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">A new generation in SPIF has started to apply the heat in different ways during forming to form high-strength sheet metals. Laser heating was investigated by [<A href=""#B3-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">3</A>] where two moving systems were used: one was a robot to move the tool and the other was a 3D coordinator to guide the laser on the sheet. Furthermore, conduction heating was suggested by [<A href=""#B4-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">4</A>] to heat the sheet metal by electric heaters for forming a 5083 aluminum magnesium alloy.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">Another heating method was presented that involved exerting hot oil to increase the sheet metal temperature as described in [<A href=""#B5-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">5</A>]. In other investigations, an electrical current was applied that passed through the tool to heat up the sheet, which was studied by [<A href=""#B6-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">6</A>] to form a titanium alloy TiAl<SUB>2</SUB>Mn<SUB>1.5</SUB>. A hot air medium was tested in [<A href=""#B7-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">7</A>] as the temperature of AZ31 alloy was increased to 250 °C and formed it into complicated shapes. Resistance heating was suggested by [<A href=""#B8-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">8</A>], using two tools held by robots: one to form and the other to support and heat the sheet metal to 600 °C.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">It can be concluded from the literature review that there is no heating method accompanied with SPIF that can increase the sheet metal temperature over 750 °C other than with a laser. However, the laser method was specialized by its complexity. </DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">SPIF has still not been implemented widely in industry for numerous reasons, including:<UL class=""html-bullet""><LI><DIV class=""html-p"">Lack of geometrical accuracy in high-strength produced parts [<A href=""#B9-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">9</A>,<A href=""#B10-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">10</A>];</DIV></LI><LI><DIV class=""html-p"">Limited applications, especially for high-strength metals;</DIV></LI><LI><DIV class=""html-p"">Lack of suitability for difficult-to-manufacture parts with a perpendicular wall angle, such as deep drawing;</DIV></LI><LI><DIV class=""html-p"">Suitable only for prototype manufacturing because of the time consumed during tool travel along its designed path; and</DIV></LI><LI><DIV class=""html-p"">Different component properties in comparison to the conventional sheet metal forming technologies.</DIV></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">This paper proposes a method to increase the importance of SPIF by demonstrating induction heating synchronized with SPIF, or induction-assisted SPIF (IASPIF). The availability of a viable induction heating method with SPIF would increase the interest in it. An advantage of our approach is that high-strength sheet metals can be simply formed into complex geometries by adopting a simplified mechanism.</DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""sec2-jmmp-01-00005"" type=""""><H2 data-nested=""1"">  2. Materials and Methods </H2><DIV class=""html-p"">The sheet metal blanks and their specific parameters for our dieless SPIF investigation were tested by many devices to improve the efficacy of the suggested process. It became clear that the process parameters have a very large influence on the experimental results.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">HCT980C dual-phase steel is well known as an advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) and was investigated using a sheet with a thickness of 1.2 mm. The steel alloy was supplied by <mark>ThyssenKrupp Stahl</mark>-Service-Centre (Radebeul, Germany). The full specifications and properties of the mentioned steel alloy can be found in [<A href=""#B11-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">11</A>]. </DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">The experimental setup of the dieless single-point incremental forming process assisted by induction heating was the same as that used in [<A href=""#B12-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">12</A>] and is illustrated in <A href=""#jmmp-01-00005-f001"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 1</A>. The forming tool material was made from hot-worked tool steel X210Cr12 (1.2080) with a diameter of 12 mm. The tool is fully quenched and hardened to 64 HRC and forming tips with diameters of 6 and 12 mm were used. A high frequency induction generator was used with a maximum power capacity of 50 kW and the magnetic radiation frequency was 325 kHz. </DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">An induction coil was connected to the induction generator head which moved simultaneously with the forming tool. A one-turn induction coil utilized in the experiments had outer and inner diameters of 20 and 8 mm, respectively. The coil was made from a rectangular profile with a width of 6 mm shaping the coil face. It also had a depth of 4 mm, as shown in <A href=""#jmmp-01-00005-f002"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 2</A>. </DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">The suggested profile geometry was designed by the SOLIDWORKS software and then exported into a step file to obtain the tool path code that is used by the CNC milling machine. The tool path code program was made by a CAM-software named ESPRIT. A Kistler dynamometer (type 9255Asp) made by Kistler Instrumente AG (CH-8408 Winterthur, Switzerland) was utilized to enhance the resulting forming forces. </DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">There were difficulties measuring the generated heat in the assembled system. The thermocouple could not be used because of the continuous movement of both the forming tool on the upper portion and the induction coil in the lower portion of the sheet. Therefore, the induction heating temperature was measured by an infrared (IR) camera (InfraTec type VarioCAM<SUP>®</SUP>) produced by ESW GmbH (Wedel, Germany), which has a measuring range from −40 to 1700 °C. The measuring frequency was 2 Hz (2 pictures/sec). The IR camera was adopted to measure the lower portion of the sheet temperature, as in [<A href=""#B13-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">13</A>].</DIV><SECTION id=""sec2dot1-jmmp-01-00005"" type=""""><H4 class=""html-italic"" data-nested=""2"">  2.1. Effect of Heat on the Formability of the HCT980C Steel</H4><DIV class=""html-p"">As indicated in <A href=""#jmmp-01-00005-f003"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 3</A>, the increase in temperature caused a reduction in tensile strength and an increase in ductility due to the transformation of the martensitic phase into pearlite and ferrite. These results were obtained by heating up the material to the desired temperature, soaking up to 20 min and then performing the tensile test. The heating oven was attached to the tensile test machine and the temperature was applied during the tensile test. The tensile tests were carried out according to standard DIN EN 10002-5 by a universal tensile testing machine manufactured by Hegewald and Peschke, GmbH (Nossen, Germany). </DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""sec2dot2-jmmp-01-00005"" type=""""><H4 class=""html-italic"" data-nested=""2"">  2.2.

Results and Discussion</H2><DIV class=""html-p"">The results contained useful information about HCT980C steel behaviour during dieless hot SPIF. The formability was increased by forming cone wall angles of 62° for HCT980C steel. A new forming technique was developed by forming with variable feed rates during the operation. Initial investigations were done without applying induction heating, forming at room temperature to compare to the parts that were formed by applying induction heating later at elevated temperatures.</DIV><SECTION id=""sec3dot1-jmmp-01-00005"" type=""""><H4 class=""html-italic"" data-nested=""2"">  3.1. The Effect of Induction Power on the Geometrical Accuracy</H4><DIV class=""html-p"">The accuracy of the conical parts that were formed from HCT980C steel was measured by a GOMATOS scanning system as the cone profile was clamped by a fixture to guarantee the exact measuring position, as stated in [<A href=""#B14-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">14</A>]. The scanned profiles represent the formed parts produced during the experiment. The scanned profiles were merged and compared with those designed by the CAD program SOLIDWORKS. The rapprochement between the scanned and the CAD models was done by applying the GOM inspect program. The actual model was placed over the CAD model for the comparison. <A href=""#jmmp-01-00005-f004"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 4</A> shows the CAD model of the cone shapes used in this study. Each point on the CAD model was compared with the respective points in the actual model and the combined deviations of the two models appeared as color-scaled deviations.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">The most striking results came from the comparison of the scanned profiles and CAD models as indicated in <A href=""#jmmp-01-00005-f005"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 5</A>. The higher the induction power, the lower the difference between the CAD and scanned profiles. These results correlate satisfactorily with Magnus [<A href=""#B15-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">15</A>] (p. 118) which stated that a more accurate geometry was formed by a higher laser power that generated higher temperatures.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">The negative deviations presented in <A href=""#jmmp-01-00005-f005"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 5</A> mean that the scanned part level is lower than the CAD profile level. However, the positive deviations express that the scanned part level is higher than the CAD profile level. </DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""sec3dot2-jmmp-01-00005"" type=""""><H4 class=""html-italic"" data-nested=""2"">  3.2.

The forces during induction heating were limited to 1850 N. It is, therefore, not possible to form the HCT980C steel at room temperature. </DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">The high fluctuation in the forming forces was also discovered by [<A href=""#B16-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">16</A>]. The pulsing phenomenon in the forming forces was caused by continuous movement of the forming tool on the sheet blank. A calibration process was performed to validate the measured forces in the z-axis direction equal to ± 5 N.</DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""sec3dot3-jmmp-01-00005"" type=""""><H4 class=""html-italic"" data-nested=""2"">  3.3. Influence of Induction Heating on the Microhardness and Mechanical Properties</H4><DIV class=""html-p"">The maximum tensile strength of HCT980C steel as delivered was 1000 MPa, but after forming at a feed rate of 1.5 m/min and using an induction power of 12.5 kW, the resulting tensile strength decreased to approximately 540 MPa. The obtained tensile strength after forming was extracted from a tensile test sample that was described in <A href=""#sec2dot2-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-sec"">Section 2.2</A>. </DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">The HCT980C tensile strength was significantly influenced when heated to more than 750 °C as investigated by [<A href=""#B17-jmmp-01-00005"" class=""html-bibr"">17</A>]. The sample temperature reached 790 °C when formed at a feed rate of 1.5 m/min and using an induction power of 12.5 kW as shown in <A href=""#jmmp-01-00005-f007"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 7</A>a. At the same time, the formed cone was divided into 3 equal zones as shown in <A href=""#jmmp-01-00005-f007"" class=""html-fig"">Figure 7</A>b, and the microhardness values of each zone were found different from the neighbouring zone.

New Forming Technique</H4><DIV class=""html-p"">The new forming technique is done by forming at a varied feed rate instead of forming at a constant feed rate. In our experiment, the depth of the formed cone was 50 mm and it was divided into eight sections.

A large number of feed rates were investigated during initial experiments. This technique depends on changing the feed rate with cone depth during on-line forming operations, which also serves to control the heat distribution in the formed part shape. The optimum feed rates as stated in <A href=""#jmmp-01-00005-t001"" class=""html-table"">Table 1</A> were selected carefully according to the resulting mechanical properties of the formed part as described in the next section.</DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""sec3dot4dot2-jmmp-01-00005"" type=""""><H4 class=""data-nested='3'"">  3.4.2.

Conclusions and Outlook </H2><DIV class=""html-p"">A cone shape in HCT980C steel was accomplished using SPIF assisted by induction heating. The geometrical accuracy was enhanced by varying the feed rate and increasing the induction power. </DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">The forming force generated during induction heating was reduced to 1850 N from 5500 N that was generated during forming at room temperature. </DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">This investigation proposed a method to form the AHSS aided by induction heating, but disadvantages due to excessive heating rates were observed. The excessive heating rates caused an increase in ductility and reduction in the hardness of the formed part. However, a smart solution was introduced to solve the ductility and hardness problem by forming at a variable feed rate ranging from 1.5 to 4.125 m/s. The difference in heating temperature at the beginning and the end of forming time in constant feed rate was 275 °C. However, by applying the new method, the difference from the beginning to the end of the forming time was less than 100 °C. The formability of HCT980C steel was demonstrated by forming a part with a 70° wall angle. </DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">Future investigations could include heating the sheet up to 900 °C and performing a quenching operation to increase the hardness during forming. This can be done by using a quenchable steel to make a tailored part of different strength zones. </DIV></SECTION></DIV><DIV class=""html-back""><SECTION id=""html-ack"" class=""html-ack""><H2>Acknowledgments</H2><DIV class=""html-p"">The authors would like to thank the Institute of Machine Tools and Production Processes IWP at the TU Chemnitz and the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU for their support.</DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""html-notes"" class=""html-notes""><H2>Author Contributions</H2><DIV class=""html-p"">A.

Uncertainty about <mark>climate policy</mark> after 2020, both EU and UK, has not been helpful for investment. But it is part of a complex panoply of other factors; the most clear and present being massive downward pressure on prices as a result of oversupply on the global market. This blog addresses three key issues: structural changes in the European steel sector, China and the global market and <mark>climate change</mark> policies.</P><P><STRONG>Structural changes in the European steel sector</STRONG></P><P>The problems at Redcar and Scunthorpe stem from their recent history and the impact of structural changes in the European steel sector.</P><P>Both Redcar and Scunthorpe are large integrated steel plants, producing steel from iron ore and coke. Redcar had been identified in the early 1970s as the centrepiece of the nationalised British Steel’s expansion, but that expansion was aborted by the oil crisis and Redcar struggled to find a role. In 2010, its owner, Tata Steel Europe, decided to mothball the works, but unexpectedly SSI, which needed a source of semi-finished steel slabs, appeared as a buyer. SSI bought Redcar for about $500m, a fraction of the cost of building a greenfield plant nearer home, and was willing to pay a premium for Redcar’s slabs. Since then the global price of slabs has fallen substantially, and slab supply goes only to the lowest cost producers (e.g. Russia).</P><P>Scunthorpe, also owned by Tata Steel Europe, is largely focused on steel long products (bar and rod for engineering; rails; sections and beams for construction); it also makes slabs for heavy plate, including two Scottish plate-rolling mills. These products are particularly vulnerable to competition from foreign imports because they compete mostly on price.</P><P>Redcar and Scunthorpe are not alone in the challenges they face. Increased competition has forced the European steel sector to shift its focus to higher value products for the automotive and energy industry. Tata announced in October its exit from its marginal business in plate and now focuses primarily on flat products, sourced from two large integrated works, Ijmuiden, its coastal site in the Netherlands, and Port Talbot in South Wales where it has invested £300m or so in recent years and benefits from the strength of demand from the UK automotive industry. It remains one of the European steelmaking giants, along with ArcelorMittal Europe and <mark>ThyssenKrupp Stahl</mark> (TKS). The most profitable of Europe’s significant steelmakers is Voestalpine (Austria), largely in higher value steels. The most important sector for these steelmakers is automotive, although the power business is also significant.</P><P><STRONG>China and the global steel market  </STRONG></P><P>Why make steel in Europe at all? The raw materials come from far away, and the costs of labour and energy are higher than in emerging economies. The answer is that Europe represents some of the most attractive markets for steel, both in manufacturing and in construction.</P><P>Construction steels are generally lower value (e.g. rebar) and they can be made in low-cost and flexible minimills from local scrap and hence provide a convenient ‘Just-in-Time’ service to the construction industry. But unless construction steels can compete on cost they are vulnerable to imports.</P><P>Steel for manufacturing also has to compete on cost, but even more on service and reliability. Leading European steelmakers are also increasingly seeking to add value by cooperating with their leading customers to develop special grades (e.g. high strength steels).</P><P>However the global steel industry has been suffering from the emergence of chronic overcapacity, especially overcapacity of 300mt or so in China, and the explosion of Chinese exports (now at about 110mt pa). Raw material prices have fallen substantially in line with steel prices, especially as huge new supplies of iron ore came on-stream in Australia, at the wrong moment.</P><P>The availability of increasing amounts of cheap Chinese steel in global markets has led to massive downwards pressure on prices, which, having weakened since 2011, have fallen 20 per cent or so in the last year, and in some products more. As a result steel makers all over Europe have been struggling to compete, particularly those making commodity steel products like Redcar and Scunthorpe.</P><P><STRONG>The steel sector and <mark>climate change</mark> policies </STRONG></P><P>So steelmakers in the European Union face falling prices and yet have to pay largely fixed high labour costs and increasing energy prices. As <mark>climate change</mark> policies tend to increase energy costs to what extent are they part of the problem?</P><P>For the integrated players like Redcar and Scunthorpe electricity costs are small but they do face costs on their <mark>carbon</mark> emissions via the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Nevertheless, these costs have so far been very low as a result of the free allocation of emissions permits. The real problem of ‘<mark>carbon</mark> leakage’ for them is principally the blight of uncertainty about the future price of emissions permits in the 2020s and beyond, which does have a negative impact on new investment in Europe.</P><P>Steelmakers using electric arc furnaces on the other hand are directly affected by rising electricity prices. Hence many countries have introduced schemes, blessed by the European Commission, compensating firms for policy based price increses. For example the Government has promised UK energy-intensive £500mpa up to 2019/20.</P><P><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> policies are not, of course, the main source of the problem the UK steel sector currently faces. Energy and labour costs are high before counting in any impact from <mark>climate change</mark> policies and UK firms, particularly those producing lower grade steels are struggling to compete a price level set by cheap Chinese exports. When operating margins are very low every additional percentage in cost does hurt.  There are tipping points of bankruptcy and closure which are not easy to predict. However, uncertainty about future policy does act as blight.  There is nervousness about committing major new investment to plants in Europe when the support that energy intensive sectors (like steel) will receive post-2020 is yet to be defined.</P><P>The pressures that steel imports are creating in the European market show how important it is to address the challenge of designing and implementing a workable global scheme for Border <mark>Carbon</mark> Adjustment. Without such a scheme, effective <mark>carbon</mark> pricing in energy-intensive sectors will be swept aside by the realities of industrial survival.</P></DIV><DIV class=""span4"" id=""sidebar""><SPAN class=""rptag"">Research programmes</SPAN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

There is now a unique opportunity to engage top talent in Finland. A versatile way of thinking and a true understanding of improving life through digitalization have created outstanding products and services. Due to a structural change in the Finnish ICT (information and communications technology) sector, Nokia’s lasting legacy ensures that Finnish engineers know how to mass manufacture even the most complex electronics.</P><P>
Finland is home to world leading mobile gaming companies, such as Supercell (Clash of Clans), Rovio (Angry Birds) and Fingersoft. Wearables cover everything from fitness trackers, augmented reality glasses and smart contact lenses to smart jewelry, smart clothes and smart fabrics. A world-class cluster of machinery companies, such as Kone, Metso, Valmet, and Wärtsilä, combined with a high concentration of ICT professionals, has enabled Finland to become a pioneer of the Industrial Internet.</P><H3>
ICT - Finland's unofficial language</H3><P>
<mark>Innovation</mark> driven and economically successful Finland has given the world the mobile text message (SMS), the Heart Rate Monitor and the Linux operating system, just to name a few. Finland is the biggest contributor to global <mark>innovation</mark> in the world (ITIF 2016). The R&amp;D expenditure in Finland was 2.9 % of GDB in 2015.</P><P> </P><P>The R&amp;D framework builds on a strong emphasis of IPR protection. It is noteworthy that in a joint R&amp;D project, the IPR is the property of a company, not a research institution or a university in Finland. This encourages companies to develop and test their new digital services in Finland. The most advanced 5G test network brings together, for the first time, the “big three” – Nokia, Ericsson and Huawei – proving the ultimate openness of the ecosystem.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

At the greatest and oldest aviation fair of the world parties of the industry are meeting and the newest technologies are being presented. In 2017 there were 320.000 visitors and about 2.400 exhibitors taking part.  </P><P><B>MOU signing between Niedersachsen and Washington State </B></P><P>During the fair week it was possible for the visitors to catch up on the aviation and ecological location Niedersachsen at the northern Germany booth. In addition there were diverse opportunities to get in contact and socialize with international networks of the aviation industry and cross-sectional areas due to the presence of the state.  One highlight certainly was the signing of the MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) between Niedersachsen and Washington State. This political agreement strengthens the partnership of the signatories with a focus on the aviation and aerospace industry as well as renewable energy production. Thereby the base for an intensified exchange in this area of technology was laid and future collaborations are easier to be implemented.

Some great buildings pass unnoticed below the radar of architectural intelligentsia. And not because they are small or built in lost places, but because they are too 'client oriented'. If a corporation is satisfied with their new HQ building, its architectural quality must have been low, or so the thinking goes. This post describes a recently finished great group of buildings - two times great, since they are both architecturally compelling and they perfectly reflect their owner and user's vision. If this group of buildings is interesting in a number of ways, one of them is the facade treatment, as I will try to demonstrate here below.
During several decades the architectural landscape of the Ruhr Valley towns in Germany has been dominated by neglected brown fields, industrial ruins and run-down postwar buildings. That is now becoming a thing of the past as architects from all over Europe complete their projects in the former coal-mining region.The <A href=""http://www.thyssenkrupp.com/quartier/en/quarter/"">ThyssenKrupp Quarter</A> in Essen is part of a 230-hectare downtown area known as the Krupp belt. The site, kept for years as a wasteland, is a historic place. In 1818, Friedrich Krupp founded a cast steelworks on the same spot, which his son Alfred turned into a global company. Railway tracks were produced here for the United States, and less exciting but quite effective canons were casted in the area for two world wars. It is a place in German history that triggers mixed emotions to say the least. A less known but more interesting tip for architects: the huge 'gerberettes' designed by Rice, Piano and Rogers for the Pompidou Centre in Paris were also built at the Krupp furnaces, not far from Essen. Krupp was the only company in Europe who stood to the challenge of producing the big cast steel pieces that were to play a significant role in the structural concept of the Beaubourg.
Thyssen­Krupp has built its new headquarters in this historic part of Essen at a total cost of 300 million euros. The technology giant, which employs 173,000 personnel in 80 countries, has no interest for skyscrapers. ThyssenKrupp’s chief expectation during the competition was that architects made the essence of its brand visible: transparency, <mark>innovation</mark> and far-ranging versatility. With the bulk of the masterplan finished this last summer, corporate culture and German industrial power welcome a new symbol. Chaix &amp; Morel et associés (Paris) and JSWD Architects (Cologne) won the competition for the campus buildings and developed the ThyssenKrupp Quarter for a working population of 2,000 employees. There is ample space for them here. A 200 meter-long and 30 meter-wide pool forms an axis along which various buildings and generously laid-out boulevards appear. It is quiet around here, too. Cars disappear into car parks and subterranean garages around the plot. All deliveries are conducted below ground. Above this, 68 trees from five continents form a boulevard. There are large expanses of lush green lawn without bushes or perennials. The important aspects here are distance, silence and solemnity. Peter Drucker would have salivated in awe: this is the spirit of the new corporation, built to last.The main building, known as Q1 and officially inaugurated in June, has a flexible facade layer made up of 400,000 stainless steel slats. This system aims to make air conditioning redundant. A weather station on the roof sends signals to a computer that steers the rotation of the facade slats. The design makes use of the material Nirosta, one of the concern’s branded products. ThyssenKrupp also aims to improve the cladding of high-rise buildings, and replace expensive aluminum profiles. To this end, the company has developed steel sheeting with a zinc and magnesium coating.
There are three elements that deserve to be described in more detail in this post: the glass mullionless curtain walls in the centre of Q1, the sunshades at the external office areas also in Q1, and the flat-rolled steel cladding of buildings Q1 (inside the atrium), Q2 forum, Q5 and Q7 (as the main facade cladding). Let's go with the description, one at a time.<B>Panoramic windows at the atrium</B>
The large atrium area of Q1 shimmers as a result of its pearl-metallic gold color internal cladding.  But it is primarily the expansive volume of space that captivates. The 50 meter-high building, bonded from two L-shaped structures, is dominated by 'panorama windows', in fact two large tensed cable curtain walls. Both glass constructions are 28 meter high and 26 meter wide. The design and engineering of the panorama windows was done by <A href=""http://www.wernersobek.com/"">Werner Sobek</A> from Stuttgart. The facade contractor was <A href=""http://hefi-glaskonstruktiv.de/"">Hefi Glaskonstructiv</A> from Talheim, Germany.<TABLE cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;""><TBODY><TR><TD class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;""><SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;""><SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: x-small;""><I>View of the main axis pool through the panorama window at Q1</I></SPAN></SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>A steel pre-stressed cable net system holds the individual glass panes in place. Each double glass unit is 2.15m wide x 3.60m high, with clamps at the corners and mid height to connect it to the vertical and horizontal steel cables. Pre-stressing in two axes made it possible to eliminate complicated transitional details to the adjacent facade structures. In the vertical direction, with a grid dimension of 2.15m, the grid is composed of pairs of pre-stressed cables with a diameter of 30mm each. They are fixed to a three-story steel truss below the building’s 11th floor. The horizontal net structure, attached at the ends to the story floors, consists of one pre-stressed steel cable every 3.60m, with a diameter of 32mm. The vertical cable disposition in pairs allows the transfer of the glass self-weight via a force couple - tension and compression - into the pre-stressed cables. The horizontal pre-stress per story is 34 tons, while the vertical pre-stress connection is 2 x 15 tons. To transmit these forces the engineers from Werner Sobek chose <mark>carbon</mark> steel of grade S355. Compared with stainless steel, <mark>carbon</mark> steel displays a higher strength and a lower thermal expansion. The cables have a tensile strength of 1770N/mm2.
The structural solution followed here is quite similar to the Lufthansa Aviation Centre in Frankfurt, also by Werner Sobek, although in Frankfurt the only load-bearing elements are the vertically tensioned cables.<TABLE cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;""><TBODY><TR><TD class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;""><SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;""><I><SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: x-small;"">Atrium with panorama window to the left</SPAN></I></SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><DIV>The choice of glass was critical too: on the one hand it had to have solar control, while on the other it had to be clear with as little tinting as possible. To achieve the aim of maximum-possible transparency, a custom solution featuring insulated clear glass panes was selected. The structure is as follows: a) 12mm single-pane safety glass, b) 16mm inter-pane space, c) 2 x 8mm laminated safety glass with 1.52mm PVB film for solar control. The type of glazing chosen and the reduced support structure have resulted in an only 45 mm thick membrane that appears completely dematerialized. Despite being so thin, the glazed membrane met all thermal insulation requirements. I have not found any reference to argon fill in the glass cavity, but assume it is the case or the U-value would have been too high.</DIV><DIV>The images below show the section, elevation and concept details of the glass fixings.</DIV><DIV><DIV style=""text-align: center;""><SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: x-small;""><SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;""><I>ThyssenKrupp Q1 building: vertical section and panorama window glass elevation</I></SPAN></SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV><TABLE cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;""><TBODY><TR><TD class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;""><SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: x-small;""><SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;""><I>ThyssenKrupp Q1 building: vertical detail of fixing at glass crossing.

If you are interested, there is a good summary in pages 235 to 243 of the highly recommended thesis by Mic Patterson, '<A href=""http://arch.usc.edu/content/pages/cm/uploadedmedia/michael_robert_patterson_(2008)_structural_glass_facades1242159283229.pdf"">Structural glass facades: a unique building technology</A>'. The first and still best known example of this glass wall system is the lobby of the Kempinski Hotel at the Munich airport, designed by Helmut Jahn and engineered by <A href=""http://www.sbp.de/en/html/projects/detail.html?id=9"">Schlaich, Bergemann &amp; Parters</A>. The hotel lobby was completed in 1993 and still looks amazing 17 years afterwards. The cable net grid in Munich is much smaller than the one in Essen, but there is only one cable per direction, making the knots less visually imposing than those of the ThyssenKrupp atrium. One could say that the Sobek version is more imposing in size and less innovative in the fixing details than its SBP's counterpart. But Munich was a much less rigid, monolithic glass, not an insulated screen. In any case, at least to me, the real interest of Q1 does not lay on the panorama windows, but on a much humbler element: the sunshades of the office space all around the building.</DIV><B>Sun-shading movable slats</B>
Our industry has been strongly discussing for some years about the energy irrelevance of double skin glass facades. Their former advantage in reducing U-values has been equaled by the triple-glass units with argon-filled cavities and high-performant coatings developed in the last decade. On the other hand, g-value or heat gain coefficient (the % of solar radiation that penetrates through the glass) remains as a serious problem for office buildings in summer period. Renzo Piano was the first one in introducing the 'mediterranean double skin', that is, a continuous glass facade with a set of sunshades on the outside for solar protection. An energy simulation study presented by Mikkel Kragh and Annalisa Simonella from Arup Facade Engineering at ICBEST 2007 has got to the same conclussion: <A href=""http://www.facadeengineeringsociety.org/news/SFE%20elevation%203.pdf"">there is no direct correlation between U-value and overall energy performance in a building with high internal heat gains</A>, as an office building. In other words, the main driver is exposure to solar radiation.
The best answer from a energy and daylight perspective, even in a cold <mark>climate</mark> as the Ruhr Valley, is to combine a lowish U<SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: xx-small;"">w</SPAN>-value (around 1,2W/m2ºK for example, achievable with double glass units and high-performant thermally broken profiles) with an effective sunscreen. 'Effective' here means a screen that reduces solar gains when there is direct solar radiation but lets daylight in when there isn't. That is, a moveable sunscreen. Et voilà: this is the solution applied to ThyssenKrupp Q1 facades.<DIV><TABLE cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;""><TBODY><TR><TD class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;""><SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;""><SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: x-small;""><I>Multiple image with fins at different angles from 0º to 90º</I></SPAN></SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV>The sun-shading concept was suggested by the architects and developed by the <A href=""http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/welcome-to-the-web-pages-of-the-fraunhofer-institute-for-solar-energy-systems?set_language=en&amp;cl=en"">Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems</A> in Freiburg. The energy study came out with a proposal to provide a constant horizontal overhang - useful for summer protection and as a catwalk - combined with a vertical set of twisting fins. The fins would twist to achieve an adjustable position between 0º (parallel to the facade: total direct radiation blocking) and 90º (perpendicular to the facade: maximum daylight penetration).
The great idea in this concept was to create a vertical fin made of horizontal cantilevered slats that were connected to a central stud, something similar to vertebrae in a spine. The cantilevered fins at each side of the stud can twist independently, as arms that rotate from widely open (0º) to parallel and intertwinned (90º). The final touch was to provide a shape for the fins that was non-rectangular, thus creating an interesting texture as the fins rotate along the day.
The sunshade elements have been manufactured by <A href=""http://www.thyssenkrupp-nirosta.de/en/"">ThyssenKrupp Nirosta</A> (the company branch for stainless steel) using a chromium- nickel-molybdenum stainless steel with high corrosion resistance called Nirosta 4404 (that is, EN 1.4404, equivalent to AISI 316L).<DIV><TABLE cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;""><TBODY><TR><TD class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;""><SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: x-small;""><SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;""><I>The movable fins from inside, with the horizontal catwalk</I></SPAN></SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV>Each slat is ground on one side and sandblasted on the other. The slats thus appear to be matt or glossy depending on the point of view and incidence of light. The slat surface directs the incoming light indoors in such a way that the offices remain bright enough even if the sun protection is closed.
The manufacturing of the sun protection system must have been demanding. First, the metal strips were processed by ThyssenKrupp Umformtechnik, the group's automotive manufacturing unit. Then, <A href=""http://www.frener-reifer.com/En/New/ThyssenKrupp-Headquarter/default.htm"">Frener &amp; Reifer</A>, the facade contractor from South Tyrol mounted 116 to 160 slats onto each axis to form electrically driven slat packages. In the process, it was important that the slats remain movable in the center axis and react precisely to the signals of the electrical drive. It's funny that Frener &amp; Reifer motto is 'Starting where others stop', completely adequate to this particular job. The facade contractors did also install the inner curtain wall, made with Schüco elements. Both skins in Q1, curtain wall and fins, are approximately 7,800m2 each.
The <A href=""http://www.frener-reifer.com/resources/Neu/ThyssenKruppHq.mov"">virtual animation</A> at the Frener &amp; Reifer page shows the movement game better than my words. The programming is really sensitive: the control system not only detects the seasonal sun position, but also knows what the current weather is like due to the data of a weather station located on the roof of Q1 building. On cloudy days, for example, all the slats will be turned outwards so that the sun shades remain open. Even when the slats are closed directly in front of the facade, employees can open the windows and access for maintenance is always possible.There are in total a number of 1,600 motors to activate the fins movement. This seems as a maintenance nightmare, but it doesn't have to be so. Movable facade elements are more and more common lately, with motor costs going down and system reliability moving up every year.
This is a revolutionary design move, not in concept but in results: I suspect we will see many more moveable sun-shades in the near future. There is an interesting joint venture between Buro Happold and Hoberman, called <A href=""http://www.adaptivebuildings.com/index.html"">Adaptative Building Initiative</A>, that provides nothing but moveable facade elements to control solar gains and light levels at the same time.<DIV><STRONG>External steel cladding</STRONG></DIV><DIV>Sheet metal has long been considered a second rate cladding material – an impression the buildings of the ThyssenKrupp Quarter had to change.

The 3m long and 0.67m wide, chamfered steel panels of the Quarter are resistant to wind, weather and UV radiation. Here, one percent of magnesium is added to the molten zinc for the fine sheet metal. As a result, improved corrosion protection is achieved with a thinner coating, which means that the valuable raw material zinc can be used sparingly.</DIV>﻿<TABLE cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""float: left; text-align: left;""><TBODY><TR><TD class=""tr-caption"" style=""border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; text-align: center;""><SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;""><I><SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: x-small;"">Q2 Forum facade mock-up on site</SPAN></I></SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>﻿The fine sheet metal, with a thickness of 0.8 to 1.2mm, is more affordable than a comparable facade element made of aluminum sheets of 3mm, at least so the ThyssenKrupp guys say. The material is called <A href=""http://www.thyssenkrupp-steel-europe.com/en/publikationen/produktinformationen/organisch_band_blech.jsp"">PLADUR ZM Premium steel</A>; used as cladding for the walls of the atrium inside Q1, the interior of the ground-floor lobbies in Q2, Q5 and Q7 buildings, and the exterior facade areas on Q2 forum, Q5 and Q7. The material owes its appearance to a multi-layer coating in a color named Pearl Metallic Gold. Thanks to special pigments, the color shade of the surface changes depending on light conditions and the angle from which it is viewed. The term “Premium” refers mainly to the quality of the top coat, while the abbreviation ZM means that the surface of the steel is first protected against corrosion with a zinc-magnesium alloy coating before the paint system is applied. This alloy provides roughly twice the corrosion protection effect of conventional hot-dip galvanizing.﻿<TABLE cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: left;""><TBODY><TR><TD class=""tr-caption"" style=""border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; text-align: center;""><SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;""><I><SPAN class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: x-small;"">TKQ, Q5 and Q7 facades</SPAN></I></SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>﻿<DIV style=""border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;"">It's fair to record that the façade area consultant for the Quarter has been <A href=""http://priedemann.de/flash.html"">Priedemann Fassadenberatung</A> from Berlin.

When no official or research data were available, the EIRO national centres provided their own estimates.</I></P><H3>Union restructuring</H3><P>As part of a widespread move towards union mergers, it appears that in some countries steelworkers are being represented through increasingly wide-ranging structures. The sole remaining specific major steelworkers' union identified above, the UK's <SPAN class=""Organization"">Iron and Steel Trades Confederation</SPAN> became known in recent years as <SPAN class=""Organization"">The ISTC - The Community Union</SPAN> as part of an attempt by the union to reinvent itself by recruiting in factories, call centres and so on in regions where large numbers of steelworkers had been made redundant, such as Sheffield and South Wales. This orientation was reinforced in 2004 when the union decided to merge with the <SPAN class=""Organization"">Knitwear, Footwear and Apparel Trades Union</SPAN> (KFAT).</P><P>In Austria, steelworkers were formerly included within a broader metalworking trade union, but in 2000 this merged with a textile workers's union to form the Metalworking and Textiles Union (<SPAN class=""Organization"">Gewerkschaft Metall-Textil</SPAN>, GMT). Since 2001, white-collar steelworkers in Finland have been represented by a broad union covering this category of workers in industry in general, the Union of Salaried Employees (<SPAN class=""Organization"">Toimihenkilöunioni</SPAN>, TU). In the Netherlands, steelworkers within the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions (<SPAN class=""Organization"">Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging</SPAN>, FNV) were formerly represented by the <SPAN class=""Organization"">Industriebond FNV</SPAN> industrial workers' union, but this merged in 1999 with three other FNV unions to become the wider-ranging <SPAN class=""Organization"">FNV Bondgenoten</SPAN> (by far the largest union in the Netherlands).</P><H3>Political influence</H3><P>The weight that trade union organisations can bring to bear on decisions depends in part on their ability to influence political circles. For example, in the UK ISTC reportedly has good relations with national politicians as well as those at regional level, especially in the Welsh Assembly. Nevertheless, this has not been enough to force Corus to make significant changes to its decisions, as was recently the case with redundancies at its Scunthorpe plant. In Belgium, trade unions in the steel sector have always been influential, especially in the Walloon region, where because of the strategic importance of the sector, they could rely on the political support from the dominant Socialist party.</P><H3>Positions on employment levels</H3><P>All trade unions - in steel, as elsewhere - are, in principle, opposed to reductions in employment and to plant closures. In practice, union leaders are aware that, in the long term, it is not possible to keep all manufacturing plants open. In the end, they have to accept restructuring when it appears to be inevitable, and when this is the case, they attach great importance to the fact that the conditions be negotiated with the unions in order to provide for early retirement plans, voluntary redundancies or the creation of alternative employment for surplus workers.</P><P>In certain countries, steel sector unions support certain of the employers’ strategies aimed at maintaining their competitive position. They are aware that plants and their performances are increasingly being compared and 'benchmarked' within multinational groups (recently created in many cases). They support initiatives for research and <mark>innovation</mark> and the development of high-technology plants focused on specific high-quality market segments. This is the case in Italy, Belgium, Sweden and the Netherlands.</P><P>In other countries, the unions want the public authorities better to protect the national steel sector against foreign competition. This is the case in Austria and in Greece, where the unions are opposed to privatisation, and also in Hungary.</P><P>In Poland, the unions hope that liberalisation of trade (through the <SPAN class=""Organization"">World Trade Organisation</SPAN>), growth in the construction industry and the building of highways, and increasing demand for machines and equipment will lead to a sustained trend towards increased production and thus to an improving <mark>climate</mark> in the steel market.</P><H3>Cooperation and tensions over restructuring in multinationals</H3><P>Given the extensive restructuring in the steel industry in recent years, not least within multinational companies, cooperation between trade unions in the various countries concerned - in some cases through the company's European Works Council (see box below) - has been both sought and put to the test. In some cases, cross-border cooperation between unions representing sites in different countries has been strained - as recognised, for example, by the German Metalworkers' Union (<SPAN class=""Organization"">Industriegewerkschaft Metall</SPAN>, IG Metall).</P><P>A key example is the Anglo-Dutch Corus, where there have been some indications of an increased dialogue between the unions in its various national operations. This was most evident in 2001 when, faced with proposals by Corus to cut 6,000 jobs (<A href=""//www.eurofound.europa.eu/ef/observatories/eurwork/articles/undefined-working-conditions/corus-announces-large-scale-redundancies"">UK0102113F</A>), the UK's ISTC developed regular contacts with the Dutch FNV. FNV wrote formally to the ISTC pledging its support for the campaign to oppose the cuts, and hinted that it might support a boycott at the Ijmuden plant in the Netherlands of any work to be transferred from the UK (<A href=""//www.eurofound.europa.eu/ef/observatories/eurwork/articles/coruss-uk-workforce-faces-deep-job-cuts"">UK0303105F</A>). However, these contacts between ISTC and FNV reportedly resulted in little of substance, because of conflicts of interest between the two national workforces. When Corus unveiled plans to sell off the profitable aluminium business to the French-based Pechiney, many in the Dutch part of the business (where most of the aluminium business is located) resented the fact that they were going to be deeply affected by problems that many in the Netherlands saw as arising in the UK. Accordingly, the Dutch supervisory board used its powers to block the sale, leading management at Corus to pursue ever deeper cuts in the British part of the business. The issue of restructuring has been an item on the agenda of the Corus EWC, but there is little evidence that it has been used by employee representatives to shape the nature of restructuring in the firm, probably because of the tensions and divisions between the representatives from different countries - restructuring has mainly hit the UK plants, and not those in the Netherlands.</P><P>Dutch unions have demanded that: there must be a sufficient number of Dutch members on the Corus board (in the years after the merger, many Dutch board members were replaced by British ones); sufficient investments are made in the Dutch plants; profits generated by the Dutch plants are not used to safeguard outmoded production facilities in the UK; and money stemming from the sale of aluminium plants will (at least partly) be used for investments in the Netherlands.</P><P>It is reported that some conflicts of interests arose at the Finnish-owned Outokumpu between British, Swedish and Finnish unions during the 2002 takeover and subsequent restructuring of operations at Avesta Sheffield (involving the closure of a steel mill in Degerfors and the concentration of steel production in Sheffield and Tornio). At another Finnish firm, Rautaruukki, a reorganisation of the company that has meant fusion of the formerly independent subsidiary Fundia with the main company has created some resistance from the Norwegian unions. In these restructuring processes, the role of EWCs has reportedly been insignificant and to a large extent passive. Only in case of Outokumpu's takeover of Avesta Sheffield did the union side attempt to take a more active role in shaping the new company, but this was a partial failure, apparently due to conflicts of interests between national unions.</P><P>On a broader level, an interesting example of cross-border union dialogue comes from Poland. In the course of the recent preparation of a government strategy for restructuring the iron and steel industry, a lively debate unfolded with Germany's IG Metall around the scaling back of production capacities in the sector. This debate, however, had not effect on the programme during its formulation and during its subsequent approval by the European Commission.</P><P>The European Metalworkers’ Federation, to which most European steelworkers' unions belong, aims to achieve better coordination of collective bargaining across Europe in order to prevent 'wage dumping', arguably rather than designing union strategies and/or 'synergies' at international level to deal with restructuring itself.</P><TABLE border=""1""><TBODY><TR><TD><B>European Works Councils in the steel sector</B><P>All the major Europe-based steel multinationals appear to have European Works Councils (EWCs) in place. According to the <SPAN class=""Organization"">European Trade Union Institute</SPAN> (ETUI) EWCs database, firms in the industry with EWCs include Arcelor, <SPAN class=""Organization"">Böhler-Uddeholm</SPAN>, Corus, <SPAN class=""Organization"">Lucchini</SPAN>, Outokumpu, Rautaruukki, Riva, <SPAN class=""Organization"">Saarstahl</SPAN>, ThyssenKrupp and voestalpine. The EWCs at Corus and especially Arcelor appear to be most developed.</P><P>The Arcelor EWC is a joint management/employee representative body, set up by an agreement signed in May 2002 (replacing previous EWCs at Arbed and Usinor). The accord provides for 47 employee representatives (from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Spain) on the EWC and for a representative appointed by the <SPAN class=""Organization"">European Metalworkers’ Federation</SPAN> to participate in meetings as a 'permanent guest with a consultative voice'. The EWC meets in full session once or twice a year to deal with a relatively wide range of issues. The EWC's 16-member employee-side 'select committee' meets at least once a quarter and in practice almost every month, and plays a central role in consultation by management. The EWC has a stronger consultative role than many. An information and consultation network involving the different national trade union delegations on the EWC is reportedly becoming more developed and active. Arcelor plans to be one of the first companies to incorporate at EU level under the terms of European Company Statute (<A href=""//www.eurofound.europa.eu/ef/observatories/eurwork/articles/european-company-statute-in-focus"">EU0206202F</A>), and already has a small number of trade union representatives on its supervisory board.</P><P>The Corus EWC was established by agreement in 2000 (replacing previous EWCs at British Steel and Hoogovens). It is a joint management/employee representative body and currently involves 35 employee representatives (19 from the UK, nine from the Netherlands, two from Germany, and one each from Denmark, France, Norway, Spain and Sweden) and nine recognised national trade union officials. The EWC meets twice a year to discuss a relatively extensive range of transnational issues</P><P>Since EU enlargement on 1 May 2004, EWCs in those multinationals with operations in the new Member States have been including as full members employee representatives from these countries (such as Poland), which were either excluded before or represented only by observers.</P><P>Trade unions in steel generally take a positive view of EWCs and their role (though see above under 'Cooperation and tensions over restructuring in multinationals'). For example, Germany's IG Metall union generally describes the role of the EWCs that exist in every major steel company as being very positive. German employee representatives, however, regret the fact that if an EWC is not established according to German law, as in the case of Arcelor, they have to adjust to other standards of information and consultation</P><P>Employers' views on EWCs are often harder to gauge. Swedish steel employers are reported have a positive attitude. The large steel firms operating in France, especially Arcelor, reportedly believe that prior social dialogue enables them to anticipate and plan for future changes, and that the establishment of EWCs is a tool that contributes to employers being able to work alongside trade unions in forecasting changes in areas such as employment levels, training and the group’s economic configuration. German trade union officials state that steel employers, after some initial concerns over EWCs, have adjusted themselves to these representative structures and accept their work, in particular on issues such as health and safety.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H3>Positions on environmental issues</H3><P>The environmental <mark>pollution</mark> caused by steel production is a matter of trade union concern in some countries. For example, the German and Italian unions take rather different positions on this point. In Germany, in March 2004 IG Metall mobilised some 9,000 steelworkers across the country to demonstrate against government plans to force steel producers to reduce <mark>CO2</mark> emissions further. In Italy, the unions consider the introduction of <mark>pollution</mark>-reducing systems in pursuit of zero environmental impact to be of priority importance, in order to maintain integrated cycle steel manufacture, and therefore large-scale steelworks. The unions have asked the government to set up a permanent forum for discussion on industrial policies able to resolve the sector’s problems in the medium to long term.</P><H2>Governments</H2><H3>Positions on privatisation</H3><P>At present, governments in all countries examined consider that steel production is the responsibility of the private sector (see above under 'Privatisation'). There remains, however, one country - Greece - where the sector is still state controlled and several countries where the state still holds minority shareholdings in steel companies.</P><P>In Greece, many large companies still operate under state control, but the government has decided to transfer the controlling stake in many such public enterprises to private interests or turn over their management to corporate joint ventures. Some German federal states (Länder) still hold minor shareholdings in some steel companies or holding companies, for example, in Bavaria, Bremen and the Saarland. In Poland, the state maintains a shareholding of 25% in the main steel producer, and the right to influence certain important management decisions, up until the end of 2009. In Belgium, the sector has always been mainly in private hands but the state has taken and maintains minority shareholdings in certain companies. This is the case both in the Flanders region, where the government retains a 2.7% shareholding in Arcelor, and in the Wallonia region, where the regional government retains shareholdings of 25% in two companies. In Finland, a process of privatisation is continuing. State ownership is already under 50% both in Outokumpu and Rautaruukki and there is further authorisation to reduce the share of state ownership to 10% and 20% respectively.</P><H3>Support measures during restructuring</H3><P>In the event of restructuring, many governments play a role in seeking to ensure that this causes the least social hardship possible.</P><P>The last Steel Aid Code (SAC), in compliance with Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty, allowed certain aids in the case of plant closures. Readjustment aids, such as aid for early retirement, redeployment and unemployment, were granted. These aids are no longer possible since the ECSC Treaty expired in July 2002. The German government supported the restructuring of the sector within the framework of the ECSC, which also allowed for regional policy measures concerning the restructuring of the eastern German steel industry. Other examples of state aid for restructuring of the steel industry include the following.</P><UL><LI>In France, the state intervened actively during restructuring at the end of the 1970s, in the form of loans and taking of equity shareholdings in companies. At present, it is mainly regional councils that give their support for the granting of subsidies from EU structural funds.</LI><LI>In Italy, the privatisation of the sector was accomplished by a series of legislative measures. Among them was legislation adopted in the late 1980s/early 1990s that enabled the industry to be restructured on the basis of early retirement.</LI><LI>In May 2001, a package of regeneration measures was announced for the regions of the UK most severely affected by restructuring, mainly in South Wales and the North-East of England. This package was worth GBP 135 million and comprised compensation payments to redundant workers and cash support for retraining. Furthermore, in 2004, when <SPAN class=""Organization"">Allied Steel and Wire</SPAN> (ASW) was going into liquidation, employees were going to lose their pensions, since the company pension fund was in deficit. Under intense political pressure, the government created a GBP 400 million trust fund to provide a degree of security in retirement for victims of such situations (this fund applies across the economy rather than just to steelworkers, but its introduction was sparked in large part by the campaign at ASW).</LI><LI>In Poland, following legislation adopted August 2001, the Minister for the Economy set up a list of 20 iron and steel companies, which accounted for 90% of sales turnover and 80% of employment. This list was subdivided into three categories - those enterprises that would benefit from public aid for restructuring, those that would not receive public aid for restructuring, and those for which bankruptcy procedures had been initiated. Public aid has been extended to eight plants whose restructuring programmes guarantee fulfilment of viability criteria at the end of the restructuring period. Six plants that do not carry out typical metal-processing operations or whose restructuring programmes do not suggest they will meet the viability criteria are not eligible for public aid, and recourse is had to other instruments, eg privatisation processes. In three cases, the restructuring process was concluded with bankruptcy proceedings.</LI><LI>Belgian industrial policy has been regionalised. The two steel plants in the Flemish region have not been seriously affected by major restructuring or workforce reductions. In Wallonia, the government has intervened by: financing a fund for equity participation in steel companies; organising tripartite negotiations with the local management of multinationals and trade unions to maintain and develop steel activities in the region; organising socially responsible workforce reduction by support measures, especially early retirement; and supporting the development of new activities.</LI><LI>The Danish government released an extra sum of money, earmarked to support those still unemployed after six months after closure of Dansteel in 2002.</LI></UL><P>In parallel to restructuring and retraining aid, public authorities also support steel activity through financing research and development in universities, which work in partnership with companies. This is particularly the case for regional governments in Belgium.</P><H3>Initiatives on <mark>CO2</mark> emissions</H3><P>A policy topic that has come more to the forefront over recent years has been environmental matters. The major point of discussion has been the contribution of the sector's energy use and its contribution to meeting the targets for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases set by the Kyoto protocol to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark>. In some cases, the social partners have been involved in, or intervened in, activities in this area.</P><P>For example, in March 2004, the German federal government adopted a National Allocation Plan (NAP) within the framework of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. This plan obliges the German steel industry to reduce its <mark>CO2</mark> emissions, although by considerably less than previously planned by the Federal Ministry of the Environment. Both the German Steel Federation (<SPAN class=""Organization"">Wirtschaftsvereinigung Stahl</SPAN>, WV Stahl) and the IG Metall trade union had lobbied against further contributions towards emission reductions, arguing that other European countries would permit the steel industry to increase <mark>CO2</mark> emissions and that the USA and Russia had not even signed the Kyoto protocol. This position was supported by the Federal Ministry for Economics and Labour. Trade unions and trade associations expressed content with the NAP as it was finally adopted. The joint campaign by trade union and employers indicated that the sectoral social partners, despite diverging views on bargaining issues (see below), can find common ground when they see the future of the industry at stake.</P><P>In Italy, the problem of the environmental impact of the coke plants furnishing fuel to integrated-cycle steelworks has been raised by local institutions concerned to protect the local community. They have been backed by the judiciary, which in Genoa and Trieste has ordered the closure of coke ovens over the next few years. These rulings have provoked increases in coke imports, which exposes the sector to the volatility of international markets and increases the difficulty of obtaining raw materials for steel production. This difficulty has prompted the government to set up a Steel Industry Observatory, which comprises representatives from all actors in the sector, principally the employers’ organisation and trade unions. This inter-ministerial Observatory, which met for the first time in March 2004, has the task of drawing up an action plan to reduce the environmental impact of coke plants and establish the maximum parameters for noxious emissions.</P><P>In Belgium, the government of the Walloon region has recently signed a convention with the steel sector to increase its energy efficiency by 5.6% by 2010. In Sweden, certain measures decided by the government for industry as a whole also apply to steel. This is the case for recent legislation that permits certain tax concessions for the use of electrical energy in basic industry. In return, the companies concerned will adopt a government programme for more efficient use of energy.</P><H3>Relationships with social partners</H3><P>In the majority of countries considered the state has no formal relationships with the social partners in the steel sector. This is the case of Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and the UK. However, this does not mean that there are no informal consultations and negotiations. In France, the state maintains close relationships with the steel social partners, but not apparently through any formal structure.</P><P>In Italy, the government has recently set up a Steel Industry Observatory (see previous section). Its function is to draw up industrial policy for the steel sector, jointly with the social partners. In Poland, legislation provides for a 'tripartite sector team' (<A href=""//www.eurofound.europa.eu/ef/observatories/eurwork/articles/activation-package-agreed-to-accompany-iron-and-steel-restructuring"">PL0310105F</A>), which provides a forum for discussing all issues of relevance to the sector’s restructuring and was also set up to negotiate a collective agreement, common to at least some, if not all, entities operating in the industry. The programme for restructuring the steel industry has been agreed with the social partners. In Belgium, the government of the Walloon region organised tripartite negotiations in 2001 and in 2003 to maintain and develop the steel activities in the region (see above under 'Support measures during restructuring').</P><H2>Collective bargaining</H2><H3>Structure and coverage</H3><P>The structure of collective bargaining in the steel industry varies considerably between the countries considered, generally following differences in national bargaining systems - see table 5 below.</P><P>Sectoral collective bargaining covers the steel industry in the great majority of countries, but in differing ways. The industry has its own specific collective agreements in Belgium, Germany and Poland, and also in France but within a broader framework. The agreements in Germany are conducted at the level of bargaining regions, and agreements at regional and département level also play a part in France. In Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Norway and Sweden, steel is included within a broader collective bargaining unit of varying scope. Steel is coupled with the metal-processing industry in Sweden and falls within agreements for: overall metalworking in Austria, Finland, France and Italy; metal production and processing in Greece; ferrous metallurgy in Hungary; the whole of private sector industry in Denmark; and private manufacturing industry and/or metalworking in Norway. General metalworking agreements also cover a number of steel companies not covered by specific (regional) steel sector agreements in Germany and one of the Netherlands' two major steel firmsÜ.</P><P>These broader agreements that include steel are in some countries highly influential, often leading off the bargaining round and setting the pace and tone for other sectors in industry or more widely - this is the case, for example, in Austria, Denmark, Norway and Sweden.</P><P>The meaning of the various sectoral agreements covering the steel industry and their relationship with company- or lower-level bargaining differ between countries. The sectoral agreement essentially provides a framework to be built on to varying extents by subsequent lower-level bargaining in Belgium, Denmark, Finland (where this level is increasing in importance), France, Norway and Poland. Italy's two-tier bargaining system clearly delineates the issues to be covered by sectoral and lower-level bargaining. The sectoral agreement in Hungary does not deal with pay matters, which are left to company-level bargaining. There seems to be less scope for lower-level bargaining in Austria, Germany and Greece.</P><P>The general rule in these countries is that company agreements can only supplement sectoral agreements, and not deviate downward from their provisions. However, in France legislation adopted in 2004 (<A href=""//www.eurofound.europa.eu/ef/observatories/eurwork/articles/collective-bargaining-reform-law-passed"">FR0404105F</A>) allows company-level agreements, in certain circumstances, to be less favourable for employees than sectoral agreements. So far, employers in the steel/metalworking industry do not seem to want to challenge the existing relationship between agreements.</P><P>There is no sectoral bargaining covering any of the steel industry in Spain and the UK In Spain, bargaining is at group or company level, while in the UK it occurs at individual plant level. The main Dutch steel group has its own collective agreement. One company in Germany has decided to leave the sectoral agreement. and engage in company-level bargaining.</P><P>The proportion of the workforce covered by collective bargaining in the steel industry generally appears very high. It is 100% or near in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain (excluding management staff), and 90% in Sweden. All these countries have high general bargaining coverage rates, but steel industry coverage is in most cases even higher than average, especially in Spain, Germany and Austria. In the UK, the steel coverage rate of around two-thirds is around twice the national average, while coverage in Hungary, while low by comparison with most other countries considered, it is relatively high in national terms.</P><TABLE border=""1"" width=""540""><CAPTION><B>Table 5.

Bargaining coverage is estimated to be around two-thirds.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P><I>Source: EIRO.</I></P><H3>Issues</H3><P>Pay is, of course, the central issue in regular collective bargaining in the steel industry, as it is more widely. In those countries where sectoral bargaining occurs (see above), often on a multiannual basis (eg every two years in Greece, or every three years in Sweden), agreements in some cases set minimum rates that are built on by lower-level bargaining. In countries where the metalworking/industry agreements that often include the steel industry act as trend-setters or reference points for other sectors, this is particularly with reference to pay</P><H4>Restructuring and job security</H4><P>In all countries, the numerous restructuring projects and redundancy plans that have affected the steel industry have been the subject of serious collective bargaining. In most cases, these negotiations have not been able to maintain the level of employment, but they have been able to reduce the social hardship caused by the workforce reductions, when compared with 'uncushioned' redundancies. The measures agreed typically include the financing of early retirement, the encouragenent of voluntary redundancies, and the organisation of retraining and outplacement. To take the example of Poland, where job losses have been especially severe, a 'social package' for the iron and steel industry, agreed on a tripartite basis in 1999, has sought to ensure the conflict-free elimination of excess employment by providing for: increased pre-retirement benefits for older redundant workers; state subsidies for additional benefits; severance payments; retraining and requalification measures; and career and financial counselling. Elsewhere:</P><UL><LI>employment levels have been a major issue in France, with steel - like the whole metalworking industry - constantly losing jobs. Early retirement schemes have been negotiated (including at company level in larger firms) and an 'employment agreement' was concluded in the early 1990s. 2004 witnessed the opening of talks on the career paths of workers aged over 50;</LI><LI>restructuring and workforce reductions in the Belgian industry have always been accompanied by negotiations and the conclusion of a 'social plan', avoiding direct redundancies and very often using early retirement and non-renewal of fixed-term contracts. Preservation of the early retirement system is an important point for the trade unions;</LI><LI>a collective agreement to secure employment which allows the reduction of working time to safeguard employment and avoid redundancies was first agreed in the German steel industry in 1996, but at present covers only the 'West' bargaining region;</LI><LI>in Greece, recent structural changes have in many cases directly threatened workers’ rights and jobs. Important mobilisations occurred at the beginning of the 1990s, usually culminating in collective agreements containing mutual concessions;</LI><LI>an employment pact signed at Corus in the Netherlands in 2002 places the accent on workers' employability rather than the maintenance of employment levels. The company will do its utmost to avoid forced redundancies, on the condition that employees display a positive attitude towards changing jobs and training. Measures include reversing outsourcing, redeployment, promoting part-time work (especially among older employees), reducing working time and minimising the use of temporary agency work and fixed-term contracts; and</LI><LI>a marked generational turnover in the workforce of the Italian steel industry, with a large intake of young labour, has been handled through recourse to short-term contracts, mainly training/work and fixed-term contracts but also, in some cases, temporary agency contracts.</LI></UL><P>Concern about restructuring does not necessarily result in bargaining on the issue. For example, the main issue that has concerned the UK's ISTC steel union in the last few years has been the impact of restructuring. However, the union has repeatedly complained that the employers in the sector, especially Corus, are not engaging in meaningful negotiations on this issue. This appears to observers to exemplify a wider pattern of employers increasing their prerogative, with the scope of collective bargaining shrinking as a consequence.</P><H4>Working time</H4><P>Sometimes linked to restructuring and job security, working time is a prominent bargaining issue in the steel sector in some countries (sometimes as part of the wider metalworking sector).</P><P>In terms of the duration of working time, an agreement on the reduction of working hours was signed in French metalworking in 1998 (<A href=""//www.eurofound.europa.eu/ef/observatories/eurwork/articles/metalworking-working-time-agreement-will-not-be-extended"">FR9810136N</A>). However, it caused a serious split among trade unions. The accord was amended after a ruling by the courts, and the reduction of working time was then applied (possibly with some improvements) by numerous agreements in individual companies, without there being special negotiations or agreements at sector level in the steel industry. However, across Europe in recent years, it appears that working time flexibility, rather than major reductions, have been the main theme of steel industry bargaining</P><P>For example, in 2000, Germany's first sectoral agreement on 'working-life time accounts' (Lebensarbeitszeitkonten) was signed in the steel industry's 'West' bargaining region. The agreement entitles employees to save up overtime pay and other portions of their income in special accounts. This capital can be used to fund early retirement or periods of time off work (sabbaticals) or - in exceptional cases - to increase pensions (<A href=""//www.eurofound.europa.eu/ef/observatories/eurwork/articles/working-life-time-accounts-agreed-in-steel-industry"">DE0011290N</A>). However, as there was no agreement reached on a general provision to safeguard working time credits in the event of bankruptcy, subsequent company-level talks had to take place, which have so far not led to any agreements. In Denmark, increased flexibility in working time arrangements has been an important theme in sectoral agreements over the last decade, paving the way for company-level agreements on the organisation of working time schedules. Company-level bargaining on working time arrangements has also become increasingly important in the sector in Finland in recent years. In Austria, the sector’s working time arrangements are widely perceived as exemplary, since they combine flexible use of 'bandwidth' models (providing for long-term reference periods of up to one year during which working time can be varied around an average) with generous time off and/or pay premia for employees. Nevertheless, some employers demand a further flexibilisation of the existing working hours regulations or even an overall extension of weekly working hours from currently 38.5 to 40 - the latter has been strongly rejected by unions.</P><P>Shiftwork has been a particular issue in steel in some countries, Bargaining in Finland has dealt with the introduction of three-shift working and pay compensation and reduced working time for the workers involved. In Italy, bargaining has concentrated on work organisation, and in particular shifts, recent years, in order to increase productivity. Numerous companies have introduced four shifts a day, and some even five, in order to ensure that plants operate around the clock. The increase in shiftwork has been offset through bargaining by a reduction in individual working time. Shiftwork has also been a bargaining topic in Belgium.</P><H4>Other issues</H4><P>Other themes dealt with in recent collective bargaining in the steel industry include:</P><UL><LI>health and safety and the work environment, as in countries such as Belgium, Greece, Italy and Sweden. In cases such as Belgium this topic has gained in importance following fatal accidents in recent years (<A href=""//www.eurofound.europa.eu/ef/observatories/eurwork/articles/fatal-accident-revives-debate-on-safety-standards-for-subcontractors"">BE0211305F</A>);</LI><LI>'atypical' work - eg the use of various types of contract (part-time, fixed-term, temporary agency, apprenticeship etc) in Italy, or part-time work for older employees in Austria;</LI><LI>work-life balance issues, such as maternity leave and a right for workers to time off for care of sick children under the age of 14 in Denmark, or the protection against dismissal of employees taking parental leave in Austria;</LI><LI>education and training, as in Austria, Belgium, Italy and Sweden. For example, the current sectoral agreement in Sweden provides for the establishment of working groups to examine if skill development may be carried out in ordinary working time;</LI><LI>job classifications and new grading systems, as in Belgium and Italy;</LI><LI>new forms of payment, such as performance-based pay systems in Belgium, or profit-sharing and bonus schemes at enterprise level in Finland;</LI><LI>leave systems, an in Belgium and Italy;</LI><LI>mobility, as in Belgium and France;</LI><LI>information and communication, sometimes including EWCs, as in Belgium and France; and</LI><LI>equal opportunities matters - eg for women and men in Sweden, or workers with disabilities in Denmark.</LI></UL><H3>Internationalisation and multinationals</H3><P>As noted above, the steel industry has become increasingly internationalised (though this is not a new development in countries such as Sweden) and dominated by major multinational companies, raising a number of questions for collective bargaining.</P><P>Within the European-based steel multinationals, nothing has so far developed that resembles transnational collective bargaining. However, within Arcelor a practice of joint declarations is emerging. Together with trade unions, the group is working on a set of minimum conditions for socially responsible restructuring and recently held a first international conference on health and safety.</P><P>Internationalisation is not generally a specific collective bargaining issue in the steel industry. However, it is perceived to have an influence on bargaining in some countries. For example, a recent Danish study of industrial relations in the metalworking industry finds that a key effect of internationalisation is an ever-increasing focus on costs, which is reflected in bargaining. Furthermore, employers have repeatedly argued that in order to cope with international competition there is a need to continue the decentralisation of wage negotiations and to flexibilise working time schedules. These arguments have had an impact on the content of collective agreements in the sector over the last decade. From the trade union point of view, the threat of relocation of jobs to low-cost countries have increased the need to improve access to further education and training, preparing workers for new jobs demanding new skills. It is reported from the UK that collective bargaining plays little role in shaping the internationalisation process, but there is an effect in the other direction - the internationalisation of companies has increased their ability to relocate production across borders and for unions based solely at national level, this further weakens their bargaining position. In the UK, this appears to have been a contributory factor in the ISTC union’s limited ability to shape the restructuring process at Corus and its consequences for employees. It is also reported from the Netherlands that the growing competition in the sector puts some pressure on the collective bargaining process.</P><P>Another consequence of internationalisation may be that the new owners of plants taken over by multinationals may take different views of bargaining than their national counterparts - for example, it is reported from Hungary that foreign-owned companies typically avoid involvement in sectoral negotiations with unions.</P><P>French trade unions believe that internationalisation of the steel industry will in the long term alter the rules of bargaining, as will the recent establishment of Arcelor in the short to medium term (the setting up of an EWC in the group is seen as one step in a longer process). French unions think that bargaining in groups like Arcelor will gradually come to be organised more around specific types of product (stainless steel, fine grain and special steel, flat products etc) than geographical units such as regions or countries.</P><P>As noted above, EMF seeks to coordinate collective bargaining in the metalworking industry, while there is also a network made up of metalworking unions from Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia that seeks an effective transnational coordination of collective bargaining. However, the effect of such efforts is not always clear. For example, transnational industrial relations have been on the agenda of Norwegian trade unions for some time and <SPAN class=""Organization"">Fellesforbundet</SPAN>, which represents steelworkers, is one of the more active unions in this regard, having on several occasions called for closer coordination of bargaining at both the Nordic and European levels (<A href=""//www.eurofound.europa.eu/ef/observatories/eurwork/articles/european-coordination-of-collective-bargaining-on-the-trade-union-agenda"">NO9909152N</A>). However, it is reported that concrete initiatives actually to coordinate bargaining and demands have yet to materialise, and there seem to be little support in the labour movement in general for such transnational efforts.</P><H2>Cooperation and confrontation</H2><P>As we have seen, industrial relations in the steel sector are in most countries marked by robust systems of collective bargaining, often at sector level, with high levels of coverage. Employers are generally grouped in united organisations. The metalworking industry trade unions that often represent steel industry workers are in many cases considered to be the most powerful unions in their country and national confederation, because they are, or were, the strongest in terms of membership. Nevertheless, in comparison with the situation 30 years ago, this influence is certainly less strong than it used to be, since the importance of the metalworking sector in the total economy has declined.</P><P>Within this broadly similar basic framework, steel sector industrial relations differ from country to country in terms of the degree of cooperation and confrontation between trade unions and employers, against the current background of restructuring. The countries do not fall into clear groups, with some having solely cooperation-based industrial relations and others having relations essentially run on the basis of confrontation. In practice, in those countries where there is generally strong cooperation, often based on institutionalised systems, confrontation may arise at certain times over certain questions; while in those countries where there have often been confrontations, these have frequently taken place in support of negotiations and, in general, resulted in compromise agreements. Over recent years, there appears to be a general tendency to solve more problems by concertation than by confrontation - as indicated by table 6 below, major industrial action has been quite rare in the sector over the past 10 years.</P><P>The UK is arguably an exception here, with less concertation than elsewhere and little confrontation. Compared with other countries, trade unions appear to have less recognition by employers as interlocutors with whom it is desirable to conclude collective agreements, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, there has been little large-scale, concerted industrial action in the sector in the last 10 years.</P><P>At least six countries (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden) can be said to have systems of cooperation-based industrial relations in the steel industry that could be described as some form of 'co-determination'- usually based around strong works council-type structures or a statutory role for trade unions in cooperation, along with board-level employee representation - while consensus generally rules industrial relations in a seventh (Poland). Such systems gives workers' representatives a series of means that enable them to participate effectively in discussions and carry some weight in the negotiations when companies seek to implement competitive strategies that may have negative consequences for employment.</P><P>Germany generally has an extensive system of co-determination though works councils and board-level representation, and the steel (and coal) industry has a specific, stronger system (known as Montanmitbestimmung). Not only do trade union and employee representatives sit on the supervisory boards of steel companies but the chief executive for human resources (the so-called labour director) is effectively chosen by the trade union. In mergers, the IG Metall union has been keen to secure these special co-determination rights applying to the steel sector. This, however, has become more complicated as traditional steel companies have changed into companies operating in a number of sectors and therefore ceased to be covered by these special rules. In the case of the ThyssenKrupp merger, IG Metall managed to secure 'Montanmitbestimmung' for the steel activities of the company and negotiated special co-determination provisions for the holding company (<A href=""//www.eurofound.europa.eu/ef/observatories/eurwork/articles/undefined/post-merger-agreement-on-co-determination-at-thyssen-krupp"">DE9804159F</A>).</P><P>In Sweden, trade unions are given company-level co-determination rights by law (and there is also statutory board-level representation). In restructuring and redundancy situations, the negotiation procedure is laid down by the co-determination and employment security legislation. For example, in such cases the law gives trade unions a right to call in an adviser to provide a thorough overview of the economic situation of the enterprise, and unions may identify alternatives that should be tried out.</P><P>In the Netherlands, the position of the works council is at least as important as that of the unions at Corus. This is partly due to the relatively strong legal rights of Dutch works councils - major decisions on investments and restructuring have to be negotiated with the works council, which also has joint decision rights on social issues - but also to the expertise the works council has gradually built up, the external experts it makes use of, the cooperative attitude of management and the good relations with the members of the supervisory board (where there is a form of employee representation)</P><P>'Co-determination-type' systems also exist in Austria, Finland and Denmark, with works councils or cooperation structures and procedures, along with board-level employee representation. Norway may also fall into this group, to some extent.</P><P>In Poland, there is no system of co-determination as such, but all decisions relating to restructuring of the steel industry have been discussed among the social partners, with all parties presumably acceding at least to the general direction of the transformations. The social aspect of the industry’s restructuring have received the most emphasis from trade unions, but they appear to acknowledge that changes to the sector's collective agreements have been predicated chiefly by amendments to Polish labour law which, in turn, were made necessary by harmonisation with EU law and by market conditions. In Hungary, there also appears to be relatively good cooperation between employers and unions.</P><P>In three countries, confrontations over steel industry restructuring have been more frequent at times and cooperation has been somewhat less evident (though these countries, like those mentioned above, do have works councils or similar structures).</P><P>In Italy, the privatisation of the steel industry has not been a painless process for industrial relations. The transition from state control, when relations with the unions were based on operational 'co-management', to ownership by large private groups at first gave rise to a <mark>climate</mark> of hostility between the parties. The first years of the restructuring processing (the mid-1990s) were a difficult period for the unions, which opted for a defensive strategy largely based on protecting wages. Today, now that the initial impact has been absorbed, dialogue has resumed and is marked by a shared position taken up by the 'Federacciai' employers' association and the unions on the industrial policies required to relaunch the sector.</P><P>In Belgium, confrontation and negotiation have alternated or co-existed. Confrontation has taken the form of militancy by rank-and-file union members and one-day strikes or work stoppages have been common in periods of a worsening social <mark>climate</mark>, caused by factors such as fatal accidents, job insecurity or blocked wage negotiations. However, in parallel, the trade unions are intimately involved in local information and consultation bodies, such as works councils or health and safety committees. In the large companies, the unions usually also have delegates who are released from their normal jobs in the plant to carry out their representative duties. They are seen as being highly professional and playing an important intermediate role between individual workers and the human resources department. Nevertheless, it is reported that the power of the Belgian steel unions appears to have reached its limits in the recent period, mainly as a result of confrontation with the international power of multinationals and the loss of members during the process of almost continuous restructuring in the sector. Cooperation over restructuring with the local management of multinational steel groups is now the common practice.</P><P>In France, trade unions adjusted very painfully to the changes in the industry between the late 1970s and the mid-1980s. The strategies adopted by the various trade unions diverged significantly however, with some advocating head-on confrontation at times, like the metalworking federation of the General Confederation of Labour (<SPAN class=""Organization"">Confédération générale du travail</SPAN>, CGT), while others opted for the opposite approach of bargaining and agreement, such as the metalworking federation of the General Confederation of Labour-Force Ouvrière (<SPAN class=""Organization"">Confédération générale du travail-Force Ouvrière</SPAN>, CGT-FO). For the last 10 years, while restructuring has continued, these union strategies have overall been maintained, albeit with the lines between them becoming more blurred.</P><P>Spain appears to occupy an intermediate position. Steel industry restructuring has been less traumatic than might have been expected, with relatively high involvement of trade unions and the extensive use of early retirement with good conditions for the workers. The last major union mobilisation in the sector was in 1992.</P><TABLE border=""1"" width=""540""><CAPTION><B>Table 6.

One took place in 1993 and was triggered by the employers' intention to cancel a previous collective agreement on the harmonisation of eastern German pay rates to western German standards. It ended after three weeks with a compromise resulting in a new collective agreement. In 2003, another strike followed the breakdown of negotiations on the introduction of the 35-hour working week in the eastern German steel industry. This strike lasted four days, after which the parties returned to the bargaining table and signed a new collective agreement on the staged introduction of a 35-hour week by 2009 (<A href=""//www.eurofound.europa.eu/ef/observatories/eurwork/articles/35-hour-week-agreed-in-eastern-steel-industry"">DE0307201N</A>).

In December 2004, ThyssenKrupp apparently went back on an earlier agreement with the Italian government and trade unions by announcing the imminent closure of some of its operations in Terni. In protest, unions called a one-day strike in all departments of the Terni steelworks, as well as a demonstration in Rome. The government convened negotiations involving the company, unions and local institutions in an attempt to resolve the dispute (<A href=""//www.eurofound.europa.eu/ef/observatories/eurwork/articles/dispute-over-restructuring-of-terni-steelworks"">IT0501307F</A>).</TD></TR><TR><TD>Netherlands</TD><TD>There have been no major strikes in the industry during the last 10 years, though at Corus there have been work stoppages to put pressure on the collective bargaining process and protests against restructuring plans.

In most countries, following an often difficult process of rationalisation and change, the steel industry currently seems to be in better shape to face the future.</P><P>In this context, the level of employment in the steel industry has fallen considerably across Europe over the last two decades, often linked to privatisation and mergers/acquisitions. The largest job losses have taken place in central and eastern Europe, but falls have also been significant in many western countries.</P><P>The steel industry is still a predominantly male and blue-collar sector, with an ageing workforce in many countries. Open-ended employment contracts and full-time employment remain the norm. Part-time employment, fixed-term contracts and temporary agency work are not common, but there are signs that they are becoming more widespread in some countries, as is subcontracting. Shiftwork is usual in steel production, and weekly working time is often relatively short. Over recent years, competitive pressures have changed employment conditions and working practices in the direction of greater flexibility, while increasing skill requirements.</P><P>The representation of steel industry employers in negotiations with trade unions and relations with government is in most countries characterised by its unified structure, often through a single federation. In negotiations with unions, steel producers across Europe seek flexibility in order to strengthen competitiveness and achieve a better and more rapid adjustment to changes in demand.</P><P>In most countries, steelworkers are represented by several trade union organisations (sometimes posing a problem for unity of action among the different organisations) - these are very rarely specific to the sector, and in most cases cover metalworking more widely. In some countries, separate unions represent different occupational categories, but more commonly steelworkers' representation is divided among rival trade unions affiliated to separate union confederations. In almost all cases, the unionisation rate in steel is higher than in the overall economy, sometimes notably so. As part of a widespread move towards union mergers, it appears that in some countries steelworkers are being represented through increasingly wide-ranging structures.</P><P>In the face of restructuring, steelworkers' unions are, in principle, opposed to workforce reductions and plant closures. In practice, they tend to accept restructuring when it appears to be inevitable, attaching great importance to negotiating accompanying measures such as early retirement plans, voluntary redundancies or the creation of alternative employment. In the event of restructuring within multinational companies, trade unions in different countries may seek to cooperate, but tensions have emerged in several cases. All the major Europe-based steel multinationals have European Works Councils in place, and those at Corus and especially Arcelor appear to be most developed.</P><P>In the event of restructuring, many governments play a role in seeking to ensure that this causes the least social hardship possible. In the majority of countries, the state has no formal relationships with the social partners in the steel sector, though this does not mean that there are no informal consultations and negotiations, and there are some countries where there are formal structures in place.</P><P>The proportion of the workforce covered by collective bargaining in the steel industry generally appears very high. Sectoral collective bargaining covers the industry in the great majority of countries (Spain and the UK being the main exceptions, with lower-level bargaining only), but in differing ways. The industry has its own specific collective agreements in a few cases, but is more commonly covered by wider agreements, often for metalworking in general. The meaning of these sectoral agreements and their relationship with company- or lower-level bargaining differ between countries, but decentralised bargaining often builds on the sectoral agreements. Alongside pay, the key issues in steel industry bargaining currently appear to be restructuring and job security, focusing on measures such as the financing of early retirement, the encouragenent of voluntary redundancies, and the organisation of retraining and outplacement. Working time flexibility is also a prominent theme in many countries. The internationalisation of the sector is not generally a specific collective bargaining issue, but it is perceived to have an influence on bargaining in some countries.</P><P>Steel sector industrial relations differ from country to country in terms of the degree of cooperation and confrontation between trade unions and employers, against the current background of restructuring. While not being immune from conflicts on occasion, one group of countries can be said to have systems of cooperation-based industrial relations in the steel industry that could be described as some form of 'co-determination'- usually based around strong works council-type structures or a statutory role for trade unions in cooperation, along with board-level employee representation. Other countries have witnessed more confrontation over the years, but at the same time these conflicts have often resulted in compromise agreements. Over recent years, there appears to be a general tendency in the industry to solve more problems by concertation than by confrontation, and major industrial action has been quite rare in the steel sector over the past 10 years.

		The flag of Nordrhein-Westfalen is green-white-red, with the combined coats of arms of the Rhineland and Westfalen and Lippe.</DIV><DIV>

		NRW has changed in recent decades like no other German region. And like no other region, the state is banking on culture to do its bit to lessen the impact. The results can be viewed across the country, and especially in the Ruhr. Today, the creative industries employ more people than the mining sector. Industrial heritage sites have been turned into workplaces for designers, artists and the advertising industry. Every year, the Ruhrtriennale festival attracts visitors from all over the world.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV style=""text-align: center; ""><EM>

		Ruhrtriennale</EM></DIV><DIV style=""text-align: center; ""> </DIV><DIV><DIV>		NRW has an unparalleled concentration of museums, cultural centers, concert halls and theaters. Film festivals in Oberhausen, Duisburg, Cologne, Lünen, Münster, Bonn, Dortmund and other places in NRW provide quality of highest standards.  </DIV><DIV>

			Whilst, in terms of culture, NRW is right up there with London or Paris, there is a big difference: although we have a long tradition of culture and heritage – in fact, the cathedrals in Aachen and Köln, the Zollverein colliery and Augustusburg Palace in Brühl are World Heritage Sites – NRW was never the land of castles, dynasties and landed gentry. NRW was, is and always will be a society dominated by the working and middle classes. The culture in NRW is therefore the great facilitator of change. </DIV><DIV> </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The problem faced by the <A href=""/wiki/Chicago,_Burlington_and_Quincy_Railroad"" title=""Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad"">Burlington Route</A> was that its main terminal in Chicago, <A href=""/wiki/Chicago_Union_Station"" title=""Chicago Union Station"">Chicago Union Station</A>, charged the railroads serving it by the length of each train, and the Burlington wanted to avoid such charges, because of the line's satisfaction with Budd's products, they approached Budd seeking a solution. Budd proposed to build coaches that were taller than the typical lightweight passenger car while keeping the streamline car's length of 85 feet, with the cars having a capacity 50% greater than previous commuter cars. To address the issue of the conductor collecting tickets without having to climb stairs, the upper level was designed with its center portion open so that the conductor could reach the tickets from upper-level passengers. Two rows of individual seats, one on each side of the car, provided the increase in seating capacity, the unique design of the upper level's open center section led to the cars being called &quot;Gallery&quot; cars. Burlington approved the design and ordered 30 cars, these cars, built as Budd lot 9679-041, were delivered between August 1950 and January 1951 and not only marked a change in how the commuters were handled but also were the first cars in commuter service to have <A href=""/wiki/Air_conditioning"" title=""Air conditioning"">air conditioning</A>. The Burlington retrofitted its earlier cars with air conditioning as well, once the new cars had entered service.</P><P>With the first of the new commuter cars in service on the <A href=""/wiki/Chicago,_Burlington_and_Quincy_Railroad"" title=""Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad"">Burlington</A>, the next railroad to approach Budd to design a new type of car with a greater seating capacity while also improving the accommodations for coach passengers was the <A href=""/wiki/Atchison,_Topeka_and_Santa_Fe_Railway"" title=""Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway"">Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway</A>. The <A href=""/wiki/Atchison,_Topeka_and_Santa_Fe_Railway"" title=""Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway"">Santa Fe</A> was searching for a better design for its long-distance passenger trains and, with the design of the <A href=""/wiki/Chicago,_Burlington_and_Quincy_Railroad"" title=""Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad"">Burlington</A> coaches in mind, Budd set out to create a similar passenger car design to meet the Santa Fe's needs. In September 1952 the Santa Fe placed an order for two two-level prototypes, Budd's Lot 9679-129. These, carrying the numbers 526 and 527, were delivered in July 1954, at which time both were placed into service for evaluation, these two prototypes had seating on the both levels, stairs on one end to provide access to single-level cars, a stairway at the center of the car for access to toilets on the lower level, as well as the door in the side of the car for embarking and departing passengers. This lower floor also contained various mechanical and pneumatic equipment that otherwise would be mounted below the floors of single-level cars.</P><P>With the two <A href=""/wiki/Hi-Level"" title=""Hi-Level"">Hi-Level</A> prototypes in service and proving to not only meet the needs of line but also being popular with passengers who were afforded a much better view of the scenery from the upper level, the <A href=""/wiki/Atchison,_Topeka_and_Santa_Fe_Railway"" title=""Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway"">Santa Fe</A> again approached Budd with the idea of building additional two-level cars, this time in five different configurations: Step-down coaches like the two prototype cars, convertible coaches which could have one end of the car converted from the high level on both ends to a step-down car as needed, coaches with both ends of the car having the end door at the upper level's height to provide access to adjoining passenger cars, dining cars and lounge cars (with kitchens on the lower level) which featured a partial glassed-in roof similar to the <A href=""/wiki/Big_Dome"" title=""Big Dome"">Big Dome</A> lounge cars that were also built by Budd and delivered around the time the prototype <A href=""/wiki/Hi-Level"" title=""Hi-Level"">Hi-Level</A> cars were built.

The National Register of Historic Places is the United States federal governments official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects deemed worthy of preservation. The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act in 1966 established the National Register, of the more than one million properties on the National Register,80,000 are listed individually. The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts, each year approximately 30,000 properties are added to the National Register as part of districts or by individual listings. For most of its history the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service and its goals are to help property owners and interest groups, such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation, coordinate, identify, and protect historic sites in the United States. While National Register listings are mostly symbolic, their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties, protection of the property is not guaranteed. During the nomination process, the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, the application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation, as well as the public and politicians. Occasionally, historic sites outside the proper, but associated with the United States are also listed. Properties can be nominated in a variety of forms, including individual properties, historic districts, the Register categorizes general listings into one of five types of properties, district, site, structure, building, or object. National Register Historic Districts are defined geographical areas consisting of contributing and non-contributing properties, some properties are added automatically to the National Register when they become administered by the National Park Service. These include National Historic Landmarks, National Historic Sites, National Historical Parks, National Military Parks/Battlefields, National Memorials, on October 15,1966, the Historic Preservation Act created the National Register of Historic Places and the corresponding State Historic Preservation Offices. Initially, the National Register consisted of the National Historic Landmarks designated before the Registers creation, approval of the act, which was amended in 1980 and 1992, represented the first time the United States had a broad-based historic preservation policy. To administer the newly created National Register of Historic Places, the National Park Service of the U. S. Department of the Interior, hartzog, Jr. established an administrative division named the Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation. Hartzog charged OAHP with creating the National Register program mandated by the 1966 law, ernest Connally was the Offices first director. Within OAHP new divisions were created to deal with the National Register, the first official Keeper of the Register was William J. Murtagh, an architectural historian. During the Registers earliest years in the late 1960s and early 1970s, organization was lax and SHPOs were small, understaffed, and underfunded. A few years later in 1979, the NPS history programs affiliated with both the U. S. National Parks system and the National Register were categorized formally into two Assistant Directorates. Established were the Assistant Directorate for Archeology and Historic Preservation and the Assistant Directorate for Park Historic Preservation, from 1978 until 1981, the main agency for the National Register was the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service of the United States Department of the Interior. In February 1983, the two assistant directorates were merged to promote efficiency and recognize the interdependency of their programs, jerry L. Rogers was selected to direct this newly merged associate directorate

Buildings, structures, objects and sites within a historic district are normally divided into two categories, contributing and non-contributing. Districts greatly vary in size, some have hundreds of structures, the U. S. federal government designates historic districts through the United States Department of Interior under the auspices of the National Park Service. Federally designated historic districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, state-level historic districts may follow similar criteria or may require adherence to certain historic rehabilitation standards. Local historic district designation offers, by far, the most legal protection for historic properties because most land use decisions are made at the local level, local districts are generally administered by the county or municipal government. The first U. S. historic district was established in Charleston, South Carolina in 1931, Charleston city government designated an Old and Historic District by local ordinance and created a board of architectural review to oversee it. New Orleans followed in 1937, establishing the Vieux Carré Commission, other localities picked up on the concept, with the city of Philadelphia enacting its historic preservation ordinance in 1955. The Supreme Court case validated the protection of resources as an entirely permissible governmental goal. In 1966 the federal government created the National Register of Historic Places, conference of Mayors had stated Americans suffered from rootlessness. By the 1980s there were thousands of federally designated historic districts, Historic districts are generally two types of properties, contributing and non-contributing. In general, contributing properties are integral parts of the historic context, in addition to the two types of classification within historic districts, properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are classified into five broad categories. They are, building, structure, site, district and object, all but the eponymous district category are also applied to historic districts listed on the National Register. A listing on the National Register of Historic Places is governmental acknowledgment of a historic district, however, the Register is an honorary status with some federal financial incentives. The National Register of Historic Places defines a historic district per U. S. federal law, a district may also comprise individual elements separated geographically but linked by association or history. Districts established under U. S. federal guidelines generally begin the process of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, the National Register is the official recognition by the U. S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, if the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected, a federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation. Usually, the National Register does not list religious structures, moved structures, reconstructed structures, however, if a property falls into one of those categories and are integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria then an exception allowing their listing will be made. Historic district listings, like all National Register nominations, can be rejected on the basis of owner disapproval, in the case of historic districts, a majority of owners must object in order to nullify a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places

In 1682, William Penn, an English Quaker, founded the city to serve as capital of the Pennsylvania Colony. Philadelphia was one of the capitals in the Revolutionary War. In the 19th century, Philadelphia became an industrial center. It became a destination for African-Americans in the Great Migration. The areas many universities and colleges make Philadelphia a top international study destination, as the city has evolved into an educational, with a gross domestic product of $388 billion, Philadelphia ranks ninth among world cities and fourth in the nation. Philadelphia is the center of activity in Pennsylvania and is home to seven Fortune 1000 companies. The Philadelphia skyline is growing, with a market of almost 81,900 commercial properties in 2016 including several prominent skyscrapers. The city is known for its arts, culture, and rich history, Philadelphia has more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other American city. Fairmount Park, when combined with the adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park in the watershed, is one of the largest contiguous urban park areas in the United States. The 67 National Historic Landmarks in the city helped account for the $10 billion generated by tourism, Philadelphia is the only World Heritage City in the United States. Before Europeans arrived, the Philadelphia area was home to the Lenape Indians in the village of Shackamaxon, the Lenape are a Native American tribe and First Nations band government. They are also called Delaware Indians and their territory was along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island. Most Lenape were pushed out of their Delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly smallpox, and violent conflict with Europeans. Iroquois people occasionally fought the Lenape, surviving Lenape moved west into the upper Ohio River basin. The American Revolutionary War and United States independence pushed them further west, in the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory under the Indian removal policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape now reside in the US state of Oklahoma, with communities living also in Wisconsin, Ontario. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their New Netherland colony, in 1638, Swedish settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of New Sweden at Fort Christina and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the Susquehannocks in their defeat of the English colony of Maryland

A car is a wheeled, self-powered motor vehicle used for transportation and a product of the automotive industry. The year 1886 is regarded as the year of the modern car. In that year, German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the United States of America, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, cars are equipped with controls used for driving, parking, passenger comfort and safety, and controlling a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, examples include rear reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in car entertainment. Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by a combustion engine. Both fuels cause air <mark>pollution</mark> and are blamed for contributing to <mark>climate change</mark>. Vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries, electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, began to become commercially available in 2008. There are costs and benefits to car use, the costs of car usage include the cost of, acquiring the vehicle, interest payments, repairs and auto maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance. The costs to society of car use include, maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air <mark>pollution</mark>, public health, health care, road traffic accidents are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide. The benefits may include transportation, mobility, independence. The ability for humans to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies and it was estimated in 2010 that the number of cars had risen to over 1 billion vehicles, up from the 500 million of 1986. The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, the word car is believed to originate from the Latin word carrus or carrum, or the Middle English word carre. In turn, these originated from the Gaulish word karros, the Gaulish language was a branch of the Brythoic language which also used the word Karr, the Brythonig language evolved into Welsh where Car llusg and car rhyfel still survive. It originally referred to any wheeled vehicle, such as a cart, carriage. Motor car is attested from 1895, and is the formal name for cars in British English. Autocar is a variant that is attested from 1895

A passenger car is a piece of railway rolling stock that is designed to carry passengers. The term passenger car can also be associated with a car, baggage, dining, railway post office. Up until about the end of the 19th century, most passenger cars were constructed of wood, the first passenger trains did not travel very far, but they were able to haul many more passengers for a longer distance than any wagons pulled by horses. As railways were first constructed in England, so too were the first passenger cars, one of the early coach designs was the Stanhope. It featured a roof and small holes in the floor for drainage when it rained, the only problem with this design is that the passengers were expected to stand for their entire trip. The first passenger cars in the United States resembled stagecoaches and they were short, often less than 10 ft long and had two axles. British railways had a start on American railroads, with the first bed-carriage being built there as early as 1838 for use on the London and Birmingham Railway. Britains early sleepers, when made up for sleeping, extended the foot of the bed into a section at the end of the carriage. The cars were too short to allow more than two or three beds to be positioned end to end. Britains Royal Mail commissioned and built the first Travelling Post Office cars in the late 1840s as well. These cars resembled coaches in their short wheelbase and exterior design, when not in use, the hook would swivel down against the side of the car to prevent it from catching obstacles. As locomotive technology progressed in the century, trains grew in length. Passenger cars, particularly in America, grew along with them, first getting longer with the addition of a second truck, early American sleeping cars were not compartmented, but by the end of the 19th century they were. The compartments in the sleepers were accessed from a side hall running the length of the cars. Many American passenger trains, particularly the long ones, included a car at the end of the train called an observation car. Until about the 1930s, these had a platform at the rear. These evolved into the end car, usually with a rounded end which was still called an observation car. The interiors of observation cars varied, many had special chairs and tables

The airframe of an aircraft is its mechanical structure. It is typically considered to include fuselage, wings and undercarriage, airframe design is a field of aerospace engineering that combines aerodynamics, materials technology and manufacturing methods to achieve balances of performance, reliability and cost. Modern airframe history began in the United States when a 1903 wood biplane made by Orville, in 1912 the Deperdussin Monocoque pioneered the light, strong and streamlined monocoque fuselage formed of thin plywood layers over a circular frame, achieving 210 km/h. Many early developments were spurred by military needs during World War I and these used hybrid wood and metal structures. In 1916 the German Albatros D. German engineer Hugo Junkers first flew all-metal airframes in 1915 with the all-metal, cantilever-wing, commercial aircraft development during the 1920s and 1930s focused on monoplane designs using Radial engines. Some were produced as single copies or in small quantity such as the Spirit of St. Louis flown across the Atlantic by Charles Lindbergh in 1927, william Stout designed the all-metal Ford Trimotors in 1926. They were among the most successful designs to emerge from the era through the use of all-metal airframes, during World War II, military needs again dominated airframe designs. The first jets were produced during the war but not made in large quantity, postwar commercial airframe design focused on airliners, on turboprop engines, and then on Jet engines, turbojets and later turbofans. The generally higher speeds and tensile stresses of turboprops and jets were major challenges, Airbus and Boeing are the dominant assemblers of large jet airliners while ATR, Bombardier and Embraer lead the regional airliner market, many manufacturers produce airframe components. It has a <mark>carbon</mark> fiber fuselage, said to replace 1,200 sheets of aluminum and 40,000 rivets. In February 2017, Airbus installed a 3D printing machine for titanium aircraft structural parts using electron beam additive manufacturing from Sciaky, airframe production has become an exacting process. Manufacturers operate under strict quality control and government regulations, departures from established standards become objects of major concern. A landmark in aeronautical design, the worlds first jet airliner, early models suffered from catastrophic airframe metal fatigue, causing a series of widely publicised accidents. The Royal Aircraft Establishment investigation at Farnborough Airport founded the science of aircraft crash reconstruction, after 3000 pressurisation cycles in a specially constructed pressure chamber, airframe failure was found to be due to stress concentration, a consequence of the square shaped windows. The windows had been engineered to be glued and riveted, but had been punch riveted only, unlike drill riveting, the imperfect nature of the hole created by punch riveting may cause the start of fatigue cracks around the rivet. The Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop, first flown in 1957 became a lesson in controlling oscillation. Its 1959 crash of Braniff Flight 542 showed the difficulties that the airframe industry, the A300 had experienced other structural problems but none of this magnitude.

Edward Gowen Budd was an American inventor and businessman. Budd was born in Delaware in 1870 and he studied engineering in Philadelphia in 1888, and in 1899 he took his knowledge of pressed steel to the railroad industry. He worked with the Pullman Company on a contract for Pennsylvania Railroad, in 1912 he founded the Budd Company, which initially specialized in the manufacture of pressed-steel chassis frames for automobiles. His company was supplying an all-steel sedan body to auto manufacturers. Following discussions between them began in 1913 Budds first big supporters were the Dodge brothers, who purchased 70,000 all-steel open touring bodies in 1916. They were soon followed by an all-steel Dodge sedan, the brothers had not believed such a thing possible but they were persuaded to allow Budd to go ahead with the design, die-making and press-installation needed for actual production to begin. Other US manufacturers soon followed Dodges lead, closed bodies outsold open bodies from 1923 on. William Morris withdrew from ownership in 1930 and at the end of 1935 the Budd interests were sold to UK shareholders, Ambi-Budd Presswerk GmbH in Berlin-Johannisthal was another joint venture but with Ambi Maschinenbau. Bodies were made for Adler Chrysler and Ford as well as BMW, during the 1930s some low volume British Austin models were given Ambi-Budd bodywork apparently shared with Adler. Following World War II Ambi-Budds part of Berlin was in the Soviet sector, Edward G Budd found another visionary in André Citroën and a result was the all-steel Citroën Type B10 introduced in October 1924. Dodge placed the bodies onto conventional chassis frames. Budd envisioned pushing his technology even further, by 1934, they had developed the Citroën Traction Avant, the first unibody, pressed-steel automobile. In order to all this steel together, Budd also pioneered the use of arc welding in automobile manufacturing. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, Budd pioneered the fabrication of steel and helped create the Pioneer Zephyr. Budd stainless steel cars were very successful for many years. During World War II, Budd was also the maker of the Bazooka projectile. He and his company were instrumental in the development of the radial disk brake. Budds Pioneer Zephyr was the first of many streamlined passenger trains, the original trainset is on permanent display at Chicagos Museum of Science and Industry

In metallurgy, stainless steel, also known as inox steel or inox from French inoxydable, is a steel alloy with a minimum of 10. 5% chromium content by mass. Stainless steel is notable for its resistance, and it is widely used for food handling. Stainless steel does not readily corrode, rust or stain with water as ordinary steel does, however, it is not fully stain-proof in low-oxygen, high-salinity, or poor air-circulation environments. There are various grades and surface finishes of stainless steel to suit the environment the alloy must endure, Stainless steel is used where both the properties of steel and corrosion resistance are required. Stainless steel differs from <mark>carbon</mark> steel by the amount of chromium present, unprotected <mark>carbon</mark> steel rusts readily when exposed to air and moisture. This iron oxide film is active and accelerates corrosion by making it easier for more iron oxide to form, since iron oxide has lower density than steel, the film expands and tends to flake and fall away. In comparison, stainless steels contain sufficient chromium to undergo passivation and this layer prevents further corrosion by blocking oxygen diffusion to the steel surface and stops corrosion from spreading into the bulk of the metal. Passivation occurs only if the proportion of chromium is high enough, Stainless steel’s resistance to corrosion and staining, low maintenance, and familiar lustre make it an ideal material for many applications. Storage tanks and tankers used to transport orange juice and other food are made of stainless steel. This also influences its use in kitchens and food processing plants, as it can be steam-cleaned and sterilized. High oxidation resistance in air at ambient temperature is achieved with addition of a minimum of 13% chromium. The chromium forms a layer of chromium oxide when exposed to oxygen. The layer is too thin to be visible, and the metal remains lustrous, the layer is impervious to water and air, protecting the metal beneath, and this layer quickly reforms when the surface is scratched. This phenomenon is called passivation and is seen in other metals, corrosion resistance can be adversely affected if the component is used in a non-oxygenated environment, a typical example being underwater keel bolts buried in timber. When stainless steel parts such as nuts and bolts are forced together, when forcibly disassembled, the welded material may be torn and pitted, a destructive effect known as galling. Galling can be avoided by the use of materials for the parts forced together, for example bronze and stainless steel. However, two different alloys electrically connected in a humid, even mildly acidic environment may act as a voltaic pile, nitronic alloys, made by selective alloying with manganese and nitrogen, may have a reduced tendency to gall. Additionally, threaded joints may be lubricated to provide a film between the two parts and prevent galling, low-temperature carburizing is another option that virtually eliminates galling and allows the use of similar materials without the risk of corrosion and the need for lubrication

Thyssen was a major German steel producer founded by August Thyssen. After over 100 years of existence, the merged with Friedrich Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp to form ThyssenKrupp in 1999. On 29 September 1891 August Thyssen and his brother Joseph came to be in possession of all shares of Gewerkschaft Deutscher Kaiser, on 17 December 1891 the steelworks of the same company opened in Hamborn, Duisburg. Subsequently, the plant was modernized and expanded by August Thyssen, becoming an integrated company producing iron and steel and manufacturing ships. After the First World War came the occupation of the Ruhr, in 1934, August Thyssen-Hütte AG was founded as part of the new group. The Nazi rearmament policy and subsequent war made the plants essential to the war economy, after the end of World War II, the Allies ordered the company to be liquidated and in 1953 a new company, also named August Thyssen-Hütte AG, was formed in Duisburg. The other mills of the company in Duisburg became legally independent entities, however, the mining division was not reconglomerated, thus Thyssen became largely a steel company. In 1954/55, the focused on acquisitions to restore the vertical integration by acquiring mining concerns. Further companies were acquired, Niederrheinischen Hütte AG in 1956, Deutschen Edelstahlwerke AG in 1957, Phoenix-Rheinrohr AG, the product range included steel sections and flat steel in all grades, including high-alloy steel. By the mid 1960s, August Thyssen-Hütte AG was Europes largest crude steel producer, in the 1960s, the company also formed cooperative alliances with companies such as Mannesmann AG. By 1972, it employed 92,200 people and generated sales of 9.8 billion DM. In 1973, the company acquired Rheinstahl AG, which was mainly a manufacturing company and this takeover reduced the companys dominance in the steel industry and converted it to a conglomerate. In 1977, the company became Thyssen AG, with Rheinstahl AG already having been renamed Thyssen Industrie AG in 1976, in 1983, Thyssen Stahl AG was spun off. During the 1980s, talks on a merger between Thyssen Stahl AG and Krupp Stahl AG took place, an alliance did not take place at that time, but there began cooperation on certain business areas. In 1997, the steel production divisions of both groups were merged to form Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG. On 17 March 1999, a new group formed by the merger of Thyssen and Krupp was registered, history - Group - ThyssenKrupp AG. Die Feuer verlöschen nie - August Thyssen-Hütte 1890-1926

Dodge is an American brand of cars, minivans, and sport utility vehicles manufactured by FCA US LLC, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The factory was located in Hamtramck, Michigan and was called the Dodge Main factory from 1910 until its closing in January 1980. The Dodge brothers both died in 1920, and the company was sold by their families to Dillon, Read &amp; Co. in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928. Dodge vehicles mainly consisted of trucks and full-sized passenger cars through the 1970s, though it made memorable compact cars and midsize cars (such as the B-Body Coronet and Charger from 1962-79. The 1973 oil crisis and its subsequent impact on the American automobile industry led Chrysler to develop the K platform of compact to midsize cars for the 1981 model year. The K platform and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chryslers business in the 1980s, in 2011, Dodge, Ram, and Dodges Viper were separated. Dodge said that the Dodge Viper would be an SRT product, in 2014, SRT was merged back into Dodge. Later that year, Chrysler Group was renamed FCA US LLC, corresponding with the merger of Fiat S. p. A. chief among these customers were the established Olds Motor Vehicle Company and the then-new Ford Motor Company. The first machine shop where the brothers worked together as parts suppliers for Olds, the location was replaced by a larger facility at Hastings Street and Monroe Avenue, which is now a parking garage for the Greektown Casino Hotel. By 1910 the Dodge Main factory was built in Hamtramck, where it remained until 1979, by 1914, John and Horace had created the new four-cylinder Dodge Model 30. S. That same year, Henry Ford decided to stop paying stock dividends to finance the construction of his new River Rouge complex. This led the Dodges to file suit to protect their annual earnings of approximately one million dollars, leading Ford to buy out his shareholders. Also in 1916, the Dodge Brothers vehicles won acclaim for durability while in service with the U. S. Armys Pancho Villa Expedition into Mexico. One notable instance was in May when the 6th Infantry received a reported sighting of Julio Cárdenas, lt. George S. Patton led ten soldiers and two civilian guides in three Dodge Model 30 touring cars to conduct a raid at a ranch house in San Miguelito, Sonora. During the ensuing firefight the party killed three men, of one was identified as Cárdenas. Pattons men tied the bodies to the hoods of the Dodges, returning to headquarters in Dublán, Dodge Brothers cars continued to rank second place in American sales in 1920. However, the year, tragedy struck as John Dodge was felled by pneumonia in January. His brother Horace then died of cirrhosis in December of the same year, with the loss of both founders, the Dodge Brothers Company passed into the hands of the brothers widows, who promoted long-time employee Frederick Haynes to the company presidency

Morris Motors Limited was a British motor vehicle manufacturer formed in 1919 to take over the assets of WRM Motors Ltd. which had been put into voluntary liquidation. Though merged into larger organisations, the Morris name remained in use until 1984 when British Leylands Austin Rover Group decided to concentrate on the more popular Austin brand, the trademark is currently owned by the China-based automotive company SAIC after being transferred from bankrupt subsidiary Nanjing Automotive. The company is notable for Morris Minor, Morris Mini a. k. a. Mini Cooper and Morris Oxford series III, which would later be manufactured by Hindustan Motors as Hindustan Ambassador with periodic enhancements in India till 2014. Today, the former Morris manufacturing complex at Cowley, Oxford survives as Plant Oxford, WRM Motors Ltd began in 1912 when bicycle manufacturer William Morris moved on from the sale, hire, and repair of cars to car manufacturing. He planned a new light car assembled from bought-in components, in this way he was able to retain ownership by keeping within the bounds of his own capital resources. A factory was opened in 1913 at former Oxford Military College at Cowley, Oxford, United Kingdom where Morriss first car, nearly all the major components were bought-in. In 1914 a coupé and van were added to the line-up but the Bullnose chassis was too short and the 1018 cc engine too small to make a much-needed 4-seat version of the car. White and Poppe, who made the engine, were unable to supply the volume of units that Morris required, so Morris turned to Continental of Detroit, gearboxes and axles were also sourced in the US. In spite of the outbreak of the First World War the orders were maintained and, from mid-1915 a new larger car, after the war the Continental engine was no longer available so Morris arranged for Hotchkiss of France to make a near-copy in their Coventry factory. This was used to new versions of the basic Cowley. Possessed of a large cash income Morris had a policy of personally buying up suppliers businesses. For example, in 1923 he bought Hotchkisss Coventry business which later became Morris Engines branch, by 1924 the factory was making 2000 units a week with only a small increase in work space and labour force. Cecil Kimber, head of Morriss own original 1909-founded Morris Garage sales hire and repair operation in Oxford and they were so successful a separate MG factory was soon established south of Oxford in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Pressed Steels factory was located over the road from Morriss factory at Cowley and supplied Morris, Morris withdrew from the venture in mid-1930. Budd sold their share to British interests at the beginning of 1936, the small car market was entered in 1928 with the Leonard Lord-designed Morris Minor using an 847 cc engine from Morriss newly acquired Wolseley Motors. Lord had been sent there to modernise the works and Wolseleys products, the Minor was to provide the base for the MG Midgets. This timely spread into the car market helped Morris through the economic depression of the 1930s

It acquired Budds patent rights and processes for use in the United Kingdom. Morris transferred his interest to his company, Morris Motors Limited, Pressed Steel was acquired in 1965 by the British Motor Corporation and this led to BMCs acquisition of Jaguar later in 1965. At the end of 1966 BMC changed its name to British Motor Holdings, BMH merged with Leyland Motors in 1968 to create British Leyland and Pressed Steels businesses were absorbed into the new conglomerate. Many components of the former Pressed Steel business were gradually divested following British Leylands bankruptcy, nationalization, today, three major Pressed Steel factories are still in operation, the Cowley plant, BMWs Mini is assembled and this site is known as Plant Oxford. At their Swindon plant, the BMW subsidiary Swindon Pressings Limited has been established, Pressed Steels factory in Castle Bromwich now forms part of Jaguars main assembly plant. William Morris had recognised the potential of pressed steel car bodies being developed by Budd Corporation in U. S. A. and this was several years after Andre Citroen was co-operating with Budd in France for building Citroen car bodies. The venture was not a success, in May 1930 it was announced that arrangements had been concluded to place the Pressed Steel plant under British control. Operations had not gathered pace as expected, tycoons William R. Morris and Edward G. Budd were unable to settle their differences. This was followed by the announcement of a reduction of Pressed Steels capital from £1.6 million to £1.2 million, Morris lost the capital he had invested and the right to appoint directors, Pressed Steel was now free to supply other customers. In the coachwork exhibition at the 1931 Olympia Motor Show alongside the products of Salmons, Thrupp and Maberly, Pressed Steel Company displayed bodies of a Twelve-six Harley de luxe Austin saloon, a Hillman Wizard 75 de luxe saloon and a 12-horsepower six-cylinder Rover Pilot. Readers of The Times were told the bodies were made in four pieces, the doors were also stamped in one. These all-steel bodies were said to give the cars lightness with strength, more room inside. The degree of completion of Pressed Steels finished product varied widely, in some cases unpainted stampings are shipped to the customers plant for finishing and assembly. Other customers are sent their bodies fully assembled, painted, trimmed and glazed, when compared with USA and France the British automotive industry then had little vertical integration. Britains Big Five looked to their body suppliers, in the spring of 1953 Briggs Motor Bodies, American like Budd, had the bulk of its British operation swallowed by Ford. The following autumn The British Motor Corporation acquired Fisher &amp; Ludlow, Pressed Steel stood alone as the only remaining independent supplier of mass-produced car bodies in Britain. In December 1953 Pressed Steel Company Limited was able to advertise, a factory area at Cowley alone more than half the size of Hyde Park.

Cowley in Oxford, England, is a residential and industrial area that forms a small conurbation within greater Oxford. Cowleys neighbours are central Oxford to the northwest, Rose Hill and Blackbird Leys to the south, New Headington to the north, the Cowley area has been inhabited since Roman times. The line of a Roman road runs north-south along the edge of Cowley. It linked a Roman town at Dorchester-on-Thames with a Roman military camp at Alchester near Bicester, a road called Roman Way follows part of its route. It is behind the Mini car factory, starting opposite the Stagecoach in Oxfordshire bus garage, Cowley coalesced from the former villages of Middle Cowley, Temple Cowley and Church Cowley, though the ancient parish of Cowley covered much of the area now known as East Oxford. The term Cowley today usually refers to the remainder of Cowley, Cowley was a manor from Mediaeval times, and a 16th-century manor house stood on Oxford Road near the corner with Hollow Way. In 1139, Matilda of Boulogne founded Temple Cowley here for the Knights Templar, the house became part of the Oxford Military College which was built on its grounds in the 19th century. In 1864, the Wycombe Railway between High Wycombe and Oxford was built through Cowley, but at this time the village was so small that the company did not provide it with a station. In 1866 the Society of St. John the Evangelist, a Church of England religious order, was founded near Cowley Road in the parish of Cowley, SSJE was the first long-lasting Anglican religious order for men since the Reformation. The members were known as the Cowley Fathers. In 1868 the Eddison and Nodding Company factory was founded in Cowley, John Allen bought it in 1897 and renamed it the Oxford Steam Plough Company. The works closed in the early 1980s, and the John Allen Centre retail park has since built on the site. The Oxford Military College bought the former Cowley Middle Class School in 1876, the College hall, a former manor house, was built in the early 17th century. The Chapel of 1870 was designed by the architect Edward George Bruton, an east wing designed by Sir Thomas Graham Jackson was added in 1877. The Oxford Military College closed in 1896, developed from 1912 by William Morris as the Cowley plant, during the 1960s, the centre of Cowley was demolished and replaced with Templars Square shopping centre. In the same decade the railway between Princes Risborough and Oxford closed, but the track between Kennington Junction and Cowley remains open for freight in and out of the car factory. Between 1980 and 1992 the Headquarters of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation was located in a barracks building at Cowley Barracks on James Wolfe Road. The UKWMO was the responsible for initiating the famous Four-minute warning in the event of a nuclear attack on the UK and was disbanded at the end of the Cold War

Adler was a German automobile and motorcycle manufacturer from 1900 until 1957. The Adler factory produced bicycles, typewriters, and motorcycles in addition to cars, before World War I, the company used De Dion two- and four-cylinder engines in cars that ranged from 1032 cc to 9081 cc, beginning in 1902, they used their own engines as well. These cars, driven by Erwin Kleyer and Otto Kleyer and by Alfred Theves won many sporting events, in the 1920s, Karl Irion raced many Adlers, popular models of the period included the 2298 cc,1550 cc, and 4700 cc four-cylinders and the 2580 cc six-cylinders. A few of the Standard models, built between 1927 and 1934, featured Gropius designed coachwork. The Standard 6, first seen in public at the Berlin Motor Show in October 1926 was the first Continental European car to use hydraulic brakes,1927 to 1929 Clärenore Stinnes was the first to circumnavigate the world by car, in an Adler Standard 6. In December 1930, Adler assigned the German engineer Josef Ganz, in the first months of 1931, Ganz constructed a lightweight Volkswagen prototype at Adler with a tubular chassis, a mid-mounted engine, and independent wheel suspension with swing-axles at the rear. After completion in May 1931, Ganz nicknamed his new prototype Maikäfer, after a shift in management at Adler, further development of the Maikäfer was stopped as the companys new technical director Hans Gustav Röhr concentrated on front-wheel driven cars. In the 1930s, the company introduced front-wheel drive Trumpf and Trumpf-Junior models and these gained many successes in races, including in the Le Mans race. The last new car introduced by Adler was the 2.5 Liter of 1937, thanks to a streamlined body designed by Paul Jaray, this car could run at 125 km/h. After World War II, a decision was made to not resume automobile construction, motorcycle production resumed in 1949 and continued for 8 years, leading to the production of the MB 250S. As part of the Allies war reparations, Adler motorcycle designs had been taken by BSA in Britain and later used by the British company Ariel to produce their Arrow, increasingly, Adler focused on the manufacture of office equipment. The company associated with Triumph to form Triumpf-Adler, and was taken over by Grundig in 1957, heinrich Kleyer Adler-Motor-Veteranen-Club Website for Adler motorcycle enthusiasts in Australia Website for Adler motorcycle enthusiasts in the UK History of Adler trucks

Audi is a German automobile manufacturer that designs, engineers, produces, markets and distributes luxury vehicles. Audi is a member of the Volkswagen Group and has its roots at Ingolstadt, Bavaria, audi-branded vehicles are produced in nine production facilities worldwide. The modern era of Audi essentially began in the 1960s when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz. After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, the company name is based on the Latin translation of the surname of the founder, August Horch. Horch, meaning listen in German, becomes audi in Latin, the four rings of the Audi logo each represent one of four car companies that banded together to create Audis predecessor company, Auto Union. Audis slogan is Vorsprung durch Technik, meaning Advancement through Technology, however, since 2007 Audi USA has used the slogan Truth in Engineering. Audi, along with BMW and Mercedes are among the luxury automobile brands in the world. Originally in 1885, automobile company Wanderer was established, later becoming a branch of Audi AG, another company, NSU, which also later merged into Audi, was founded during this time, and later supplied the chassis for Gottlieb Daimlers four-wheeler. On 14 November 1899, August Horch established the company A. Horch &amp; Cie. in the Ehrenfeld district of Cologne, three years later in 1902 he moved with his company to Reichenbach im Vogtland. On May, 10th,1904 he founded the August Horch &amp; Cie. Motorwagenwerke AG, after troubles with Horch chief financial officer, August Horch left Motorwagenwerke and founded in Zwickau on 16 July 1909, his second company, the August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH. His former partners sued him for trademark infringement, the German Reichsgericht in Leipzig, eventually determined that the Horch brand belonged to his former company. Since August Horch was prohibited from using Horch as a name in his new car business, he called a meeting with close business friends, Paul and Franz Fikentscher from Zwickau. At the apartment of Franz Fikentscher, they discussed how to come up with a new name for the company, during this meeting, Franzs son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room. Horch. in German means Hark. or hear, which is Audi in the imperative form of audire – to listen – in Latin. The idea was accepted by everyone attending the meeting. On 25 April 1910 the Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau was entered in the register of Zwickau registration court. The first Audi automobile, the Audi Type A 10/22 hp Sport-Phaeton, was produced in the same year, followed by the successor Type B 10/28PS in the same year. Audi started with a 2,612 cc inline-four engine model Type A, followed by a 3,564 cc model and these cars were successful even in sporting events

Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, usually known under its abbreviation BMW, is a German luxury vehicle, motorcycle, and engine manufacturing company founded in 1916. It is one of the luxury automakers in the world. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index, headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, BMW owns Mini cars and is the parent company of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. BMW was established as a business entity following a restructuring of the Rapp Motorenwerke aircraft manufacturing firm in 1912 named Aerowerke Gustav Otto, after the end of World War I in 1918, BMW was forced to cease aircraft-engine production by the terms of the Versailles Armistice Treaty. The company consequently shifted to production as the restrictions of the treaty started to be lifted in 1923. BMWs first significant aircraft engine, and commercial product of any sort, was the BMW IIIa inline-six liquid-cooled engine of 1918, known for good fuel economy, with German rearmament in the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for the Luftwaffe. The factory in Munich made ample use of forced labour, foreign civilians, prisoners of war, the few Me 262 A-1b test examples built used the more developed version of the 003 jet, recording an official top speed of 800 km/h. The first-ever four-engine jet aircraft flown were the sixth and eighth prototypes of the Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance-bomber. Through 1944 the 003s reliability improved, making it a power plant for air frame designs competing for the Jägernotprogramms light fighter production contract. Which was won by the Heinkel He 162 Spatz design, the BMW003 aviation turbojet was also under consideration as the basic starting point for a pioneering turboshaft powerplant for German armored fighting vehicles in 1944–45, as the GT101. Towards the end of the Third Reich, BMW developed some military aircraft projects for the Luftwaffe, the BMW Strahlbomber, the BMW Schnellbomber and the BMW Strahljäger, but none of them were built. By the year 1958, the division of BMW was in financial difficulties. It was decided to carry on by trying to cash in on the current economy car boom exploited so successfully by German ex-aircraft manufacturers such as Messerschmitt, BMW bought the rights to manufacture the Italian Iso Isetta. BMWs version of the cars were to be powered by a modified form of BMWs motorcycle engine. This was moderately successful and helped the company get back on its feet, since 1959, the controlling majority shareholder of the BMW Aktiengesellschaft has been the Quandt family, which owns about 46% of the stock. The rest is in public float, BMW acquired the Hans Glas company based in Dingolfing, Germany, in 1966. Glas vehicles were badged as BMW until the company was fully absorbed. However, this factory was outmoded and BMWs biggest immediate gain was, according to themselves, the Glas factories continued to build a limited number of their existing models, while adding the manufacture of BMW front and rear axles until they could be closer incorporated into BMW

Neue Automobil-Gesellschaft was a German automobile manufacturer in Berlin. In 1915 it was renamed Nationale Automobil-Gesellschaft, in 1902, German electrical company AEG purchased the coachbuilding side of Kühlstein under engineer Joseph Vollmer, renaming it NAG. The companys first two cars were reliable, if unoriginal, the two-cylinder Typ A and 5.2 liter four-cylinder Typ B, shortly, an enlarged Typ B2, with 40/45hp 7. 9-liter four, appeared. In 1907, one of these was given to the Empress Auguste Viktoria and this sporting reputation was balanced by aggressively ugly Prince Henry-type bodies. The Puck would later be developed into a known in Germany as the Darling. From 1911 to 1914, NAGs standard offering was an 8495 cc 60 hp, joined in 1912-14 by a 1502 cc 10/12 hp K2,2085 cc 14/20 hp K4,3308 cc 20/25 hp K5, and a 5193 cc 25/35 hp. During the recovery after World War I, NAG produced smaller numbers of 2. 5-liter C4s, the economic situation was so serious, NAG partnered with Brennabor, Lloyd, and Hansa to form GDA, to prevent competition from destroying them all. It proved successful for NAG, which prospered, enough to build the C4b sports variant, Riecken ran a C4b at the newly opened AVUS in 1922, winning at 84.3 mph, which was greater than the C4s top speed. It sacrificed nothing to reliability, as NAG went on to place well at the 1923 All-Russian Trials, in 1926, Protos was acquired from Siemens-Schuckert, leading to a series of dull six-cyliner cars. The next year, NAG again expanded, taking over Presto, the difficulty was, despite their quality, none of these were distinctly different from other German cars of the period. Henze settled on a 4540 cc V8, Germanys first to enter production which became one of the outstanding German luxury cars of 1931, in 1934, NAG ceased car production, while NAG-Büssing commercial vehicles continued to be produced for a few more years. During the Second World War, the company produced the Sd Kfz 231, Sd Kfz 232, Sd Kfz 233, and Sd Kfz 234 series armoured cars

Wanderer was a German manufacturer of bicycles, motorcycles, automobiles, vans and other machinery. Winklhofer &amp; Jaenicke was established in 1896 in Chemnitz and it built motorcycles from 1902 and automobiles from 1903. The Wanderer brand was chosen in 1911 for overseas exports and was adopted for domestic sales. The first two- or three-seater models used four-cylinder 1145 cc and 1220 cc engines, the 1220 cc model lasted until 1925. The first six-cylinder model appeared in 1928, motorcycle production continued in Chemnitz alone. During the Great Depression, in 1929, the owner, Dresdner Bank, sold the motorcycle business to František Janeček. The car division with its Siegmar factory became part of Auto Union together with Horch, Audi, in this quartet, Horch was positioned as the luxury brand, DKW built cheap two-stroke cars, Audi and Wanderer competed in different segments of mid-priced, technologically advanced small cars. Wanderers of Nazi period acquired a trademark radiator design, shaped as a heraldic shield, the next model W17 7/35 PS was propelled by a new 1692 cc OHV four-cylinder engine developed by Ferdinand Porsche. In 1933 the new Audi Front was equipped with the Wanderer W22 engine, the top model from 1936 to 1939 was W50, propelled by a 2257 cc six-cylinder engine. From 1937 on there were also sporting fours and another model of 2632 cc. Wanderer cars were always admired for their quality and sporting character. During World War II all civilian production was replaced in 1941 with licence-built military vehicles, a subcamp of Flossenbürg concentration camp, KZ Siegmar-Schonau, was operated during the war to provide slave labour for the Wanderer vehicle plants. From 1943 on the Auto Union Siegmar plant produced Maybach HL230 V12 engines, the Wanderer Siegmar plant of Auto Union were destroyed in early 1945, closing this chapter in the history of automobiles.

Ford of Britain is a British wholly owned subsidiary of Ford of Europe, itself a subsidiary of Ford Motor Company. Its business started in 1909 and has its office in Brentwood. It adopted the name of Ford of Britain in 1960, Ford of Britain operates three major manufacturing sites in the UK, in Bridgend, Dagenham and Halewood. It also operates a research and development facility in Dunton, Essex. Ford has been the UKs biggest-selling car and commercial brand for 34 and 45 consecutive years respectively. The first Ford cars, three Model As, were imported into the UK in 1903 and the first dealership in Southampton opened in 1910. In 1909 the Ford Motor Company Limited was established under the chairmanship of Percival Perry opening an office at 55 Shaftesbury Avenue, London, on 8 March 1911. An assembly plant in an old Tram factory in Trafford Park, Manchester, was opened in 1911 employing 60 people to make the Model T and this was the first Ford factory outside North America. At first the cars were assembled from imported chassis and mechanical parts with bodies sourced locally, six thousand cars were produced in 1913 and the Model T became the countrys biggest selling car with 30% of the market. In 1914 Britains first moving assembly line for car production started with 21 cars an hour being built, after the First World War, the Trafford Park plant was extended, and in 1919, 41% of British registered cars were Fords. In 1917, a plant opened in Cork, Ireland, initially for tractor manufacture and this factory was the first to be purpose built by Ford in Europe. The company of Henry Ford and Son Limited–Fordson– was officially incorporated on April 17,1917 and its first registered office was at 36 South Mall, Cork. This company had acquired all Fords European and Middle Eastern business in exchange for 60% of its capital, the balance of 40% of the capital of the new Ford Motor Company Limited,2.8 million shares of £1 each, was now available for public subscription. There was considerable investing interest from America as US investors had had no opportunity of investing in a Henry Ford business. The new chairman, Sir Percival Perry, had been, and now was again, perrys association with Henry Ford dated from 1905 when Perry became a shareholder of Fords first British agency but the very first link between them was earlier, in 1903. The two men first met in 1906 in Detroit, from Britain Perry envisioned Ford making vehicles outside USA and selling them across the British Empire and Europe. He raced the cars, organized a chain of exclusive dealers. In 1919 Henry Ford chose to run operations from Detroit, Perry was determined to run all European business himself and his American managers having failed him Henry Ford offered Perry the chairmanship of this new Ford Motor Company Limited in 1928

World War II, also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the worlds countries—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing alliances, the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust and the bombing of industrial and population centres. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history, from late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, Poland, Finland, Romania and the Baltic states. In December 1941, Japan attacked the United States and European colonies in the Pacific Ocean, and quickly conquered much of the Western Pacific. The Axis advance halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway, near Hawaii, in 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia in South Central China and Burma, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy, thus ended the war in Asia, cementing the total victory of the Allies. World War II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world, the United Nations was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts. The victorious great powers—the United States, the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War, which lasted for the next 46 years. Meanwhile, the influence of European great powers waned, while the decolonisation of Asia, most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery. Political integration, especially in Europe, emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities, the start of the war in Europe is generally held to be 1 September 1939, beginning with the German invasion of Poland, Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later. The dates for the beginning of war in the Pacific include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7 July 1937, or even the Japanese invasion of Manchuria on 19 September 1931. Others follow the British historian A. J. P. Taylor, who held that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously and this article uses the conventional dating. Other starting dates sometimes used for World War II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935. The British historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939, the exact date of the wars end is also not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 14 August 1945, rather than the formal surrender of Japan

A vehicle frame is the main supporting structure of a motor vehicle to which all other components are attached, comparable to the skeleton of an organism. Until the 1930s, virtually every car had a structural frame and this construction design is known as body-on-frame. Over time, nearly all cars have migrated to unibody construction, meaning their chassis. Nearly all trucks, buses, and most pickups continue to use a frame as their chassis. The main functions of a frame in motor vehicles are, To support the mechanical components and body To deal with static and dynamic loads. These include, Weight of the body, passengers, and cargo loads, vertical and torsional twisting transmitted by going over uneven surfaces. Transverse lateral forces caused by conditions, side wind. Torque from the engine and transmission, longitudinal tensile forces from starting and acceleration, as well as compression from braking. In the case of a chassis, the frame is made up of structural elements called the rails or beams. These are ordinarily made of steel sections, made by folding, rolling or pressing steel plate. There are three designs for these. If the material is folded twice, an open-ended cross-section, either C-shaped or hat-shaped results and it is made by taking a flat piece of steel and rolling both sides over to form a c-shaped beam running the length of the vehicle. Hat Hat frames resemble a U and may be either right-side-up or inverted with the area facing down. Not commonly used due to weakness and a propensity to rust, however they can be found on 1936–1954 Chevrolet cars, abandoned for a while, the hat frame gained popularity again when companies started welding it to the bottom of unibody cars, in effect creating a boxed frame. Boxed Originally, boxed frames were made by welding two matching C-rails together to form a rectangular tube, modern techniques, however, use a process similar to making C-rails in that a piece of steel is bent into four sides and then welded where both ends meet. While appearing at first glance as a form made of metal. The first issue addressed is beam height, or the height of the side of a frame. The taller the frame, the better it is able to resist vertical flex when force is applied to the top of the frame and this is the reason semi-trucks have taller frame rails than other vehicles instead of just being thicker

Nash Motors Company was an American automobile manufacturer based in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in the United States from 1916 to 1937. From 1937 to 1954, Nash Motors was the division of the Nash-Kelvinator Corporation. Nash production continued from 1954 to 1957 after the creation of American Motors Corporation, Nash Motors was founded in 1916 by former General Motors president Charles W. Nash who acquired the Thomas B. Jefferys best-known automobile was the Rambler whose mass production from a plant in Kenosha, the 1917 Nash Model 671 was the first vehicle produced to bear the name of the new companys founder. Nash enjoyed decades of success by focusing its efforts to build cars embodying honest worth, a price level which held out possibilities of a very wide market. The four-wheel drive Jeffery Quad truck became an important product for Nash, approximately 11,500 Quads were built between 1913 and 1919. They served to move material during World War I under severe conditions, the Quad used Meuhl differentials with half-shafts mounted above the load-bearing dead axles to drive the hubs through hub-reduction gearing. In addition, it featured four-wheel steering, the Quad achieved the reputation of being the best four-wheel drive truck produced in the country. The newly formed Nash Motors became the largest producer of four-wheel drives, by 1918, capacity constraints at Nash meant the Paige-Detroit Motor Car Company began to assemble the Nash Quad under license and Nash patents. Nash became the producer of military trucks by the end of World War I. After the war ended, surplus Quads were used as work trucks in fields such as construction. Charles Nash convinced the chief engineer of GMs Oakland Division, Finnish-born Nils Eric Wahlberg, the first Nash engine introduced in 1917 by Wahlberg had overhead valves. Wahlberg is also credited with helping to design flow-through ventilation that is used today in nearly every motor vehicle. Introduced in 1938, Nashs Weather Eye directed fresh, outside air into the cars fan-boosted, filtered ventilation system, where it was warmed, the process also helped to reduce humidity and equalize the slight pressure differential between the outside and inside of a moving vehicle. Another unique feature of Nash cars was the unequal wheel tracks, the front wheels were set slightly narrower than the rear, thus adding stability and improving cornering. Wahlberg was also a proponent of wind tunnel testing for vehicles. Nashs slogan from the late 1920s and 1930s was Give the customer more than he has paid for, <mark>innovation</mark>s included a straight-eight engine with overhead valves, twin spark plugs, and nine crankshaft bearings in 1930.

The Nash 600 is an automobile that was manufactured by the Nash-Kelvinator Corporation of Kenosha, Wisconsin for the 1941 through 1949 model years, after which the car was renamed the Nash Statesman. The Nash 600 was positioned in the market segment. The 600 name comes from the ability to go 600 miles on one tank of gasoline. Introduced for the 1941 model year, the Nash 600 became the first mass-produced unibody constructed car built in the United States, unitized construction allowed Nash to advertise that the car was lighter in weight, quieter, and more rigid than its competitors. Elimination of the frame in favor of a combined body-and-chassis construction reduced the weight by 500 pounds. Nashs <mark>innovation</mark> also required new techniques for collision repairs and this included the development of a new portable body and frame puller tool that was quickly accepted worldwide. The 600 designation for this Nash reinforces the claim for this models ability to travel over 500 miles on one tank of gasoline. This range is due to the combination of the engines 25 mpg‑US to 30 mpg‑US fuel economy combined with the cars 20-US-gallon, additional efficiency was due to its lower weight than similar cars. The 600 had a 33-foot turning circle and it was powered by a 172.6 cu in 82 hp at 3,800 rpm, L-head straight-six engine that became known for its fuel economy. The 600 featured a manual gearbox with electric overdrive and coil springs on all four wheels. For 1942, the Ambassador 600 was one of series of Nash cars. Styling featured a front with prominent chromed NASH letters incorporated into the front trim, as well as upgraded upholstery. Although the automaker began to gear up for defense orders for the U. S. Government, it expected to produce a number of economical. Nash began post-World War II car production in the fall of 1945, there were few changes from the 1942 models with the exception of revised chrome trim and a projecting center section on the lower grille. In 1946, the 600 featured the seat that could be converted into bed as an option. It was possible to sleep with the legs tucked into the trunk area, the 1948 was the only post-war year that Nash made a 600 in the business coupe body style. This was the model with minimal features, lacking a back seat as well as no chrome trim, ornamentation. The 1948 Nash 600 bore the work of Helene Rother, Nashs new interior stylist and they featured some of the most stylish interiors in the industry

Sheet metal is metal formed by an industrial process into thin, flat pieces. It is one of the forms used in metalworking and it can be cut. Countless everyday objects are fabricated from sheet metal, thicknesses can vary significantly, extremely thin thicknesses are considered foil or leaf, and pieces thicker than 6 mm are considered plate. Sheet metal is available in flat pieces or coiled strips, the coils are formed by running a continuous sheet of metal through a roll slitter. The thickness of metal is in the USA commonly specified by a traditional. The larger the number, the thinner the metal. Commonly used steel sheet metal ranges from 30 gauge to about 7 gauge, in the rest of the world, the sheet metal thickness is given in millimeters. There are many different metals that can be made into metal, such as aluminium, brass, copper, steel, tin, nickel. Sheet metal of iron and other materials with high permeability, also known as laminated steel cores, has applications in transformers. Historically, an important use of metal was in plate armor worn by cavalry. Sheet metal workers are known as tin bashers, a name derived from the hammering of panel seams when installing tin roofs. Grade 304 is the most common of the three grades and it offers good corrosion resistance while maintaining formability and weldability. Available finishes are #2B, #3, and #4, grade 303 is not available in sheet form. Grade 316 possesses more corrosion resistance and strength at elevated temperatures than 304 and it is commonly used for pumps, valves, chemical equipment, and marine applications. Available finishes are #2B, #3, and #4, grade 410 is a heat treatable stainless steel, but it has a lower corrosion resistance than the other grades. It is commonly used in cutlery, the only available finish is dull. Grade 430 is popular grade, low cost alternative to series 300s grades, used when high corrosion resistance is not a primary criteria. Common grade for appliance products, often with a brushed finish, aluminum is also a popular metal used in sheet metal due to its flexibility, wide range of options, cost effectiveness, and other properties

The Pontiac Fiero is a mid-engined sports car built by Pontiac from 1983 to 1988. The Fiero was designed by George Milidrag and Hulki Aldikacti as a sports car, the Fiero was the first two-seater Pontiac since the 1926 to 1938 coupes, and also the first and only mass-produced mid-engine sports car by a U. S. manufacturer. Many technologies incorporated in the Fiero design such as body panels were radical for their time. Other features included hidden headlamps and, initially, integrated stereo speakers within the driver and passenger headrests. A total of 370,168 Fieros were produced over the short production run of five years. At the time, its reputation suffered from criticisms over performance, the word fiero means very proud in Italian, and wild, fierce, or ferocious in Spanish. Alternative names considered for the car were Sprint, P3000, Pegasus, Fiamma, Sunfire, the Fiero 2M4 was on Car and Driver magazines Ten Best list for 1984. The 1984 Fiero was the Official Pace Car of the Indianapolis 500 for 1984, the Fiero was conceived as a small, two-seat sports car with all new suspension and V6 engine. These figures are U. S. Environmental Protection Agency test-circuit results, published by Pontiac and it was impressive mileage for a 2.5 L engine of the period, and still good by todays standards, but the three-speed automatic reduced highway mileage to only 32 mpg‑US. With respect to economy, the Fiero was intended to appeal to a market niche for which the Corvette with its V8 engine was unsuitable. A mid-engine layout was chosen as a way to reduce both aerodynamic drag and vehicle weight to improve fuel efficiency, and also for its handling, traction. However, the sports car potential of the layout was not realized when the Fiero debuted. As a cost-saving measure commonly employed at GM, the tires, brakes, as a result, the handling and cornering abilities of the initial Fiero were merely on par with other contemporary sporty coupes. As drivers attempted to run the engine at greater RPM than it was designed for. The public had high expectations for the Fiero with its layout and aggressive styling. While initially garnering good reviews for its handling, the Fiero soon received negative reviews from automotive critics who expected higher performance from a mid-engine two-seater. Despite the critical press, the Fiero sold well and although Pontiac operated three shifts at the factory during 1984, they could not keep up with initial demand. The front suspension was derived from the Chevette, and Chevette enthusiasts found that they could upgrade their undersized front brakes, by 1985, the oil crisis was long past and demand developed for a Fiero having more engine power and better sports car performance

A streamliner is a vehicle incorporating streamlining in a shape providing reduced air resistance. The term is applied to high-speed railway trainsets of the 1930s to 1950s, less commonly, the term is applied to fully faired recumbent bicycles. In land speed racing, it is a term applied to the long, slender, custom built, the first high-speed streamliner in Germany was the Schienenzeppelin, an experimental propeller driven single car, built 1930. On 21 June 1931, it set a record of 230.2 km/h on a run between Berlin and Hamburg. In 1932 the propeller was removed and a system installed. The Schienenzeppelin made 180 km/h in 1933, the Schienenzeppelin led to the construction of the diesel-electric DRG Class SVT877 Flying Hamburger. This two-car train set had 98 seats and a top speed of 160 km/h, during regular service starting on 15 May 1933, this train ran the 286 kilometres between Hamburg and Berlin in 138 minutes with an average speed of 124.4 km/h. The SVT877 was the prototype for the DRG Class SVT137, during test drives, the SVT137 Bauart Leipzig set a world speed record of 205 km/h in 1936. The fastest regular service with SVT137 was between Hannover and Hamm with an speed of 132.2 km/h. This service lasted until 22 August 1939, three examples were built during 1935-36. Built for top speeds of over 85 mph, they soon proved much faster in test runs, DRG 05-002 made seven runs during 1935-36 during which it attained top speeds of more than 177 km/h with trains up to 254 t weight. On 11 May 1936 it set the speed record for steam locomotives after reaching 200.4 km/h on the Berlin–Hamburg line hauling a 197 t train. The engine power was more than 2,535 kW ) and that record was broken two years later by the British LNER Class A44468 Mallard engine.4 km/h average between start and stop. In 1938 on a test run, the locomotive Mallard built for this set the official record for the highest top speed attained by a steam locomotive. That record stands to this day, the London Midland and Scottish Railway introduced streamline locomotives of the Princess Coronation Class shortly before the outbreak of war. The Ferrovie dello Stato developed the FS Class ETR200, a three-unit electric streamliner and these trains went into service in 1937. On 6 December 1937, an ETR200 made a top speed of 201 km/h between Campoleone and Cisterna on the run Rome-Naples, in 1939 the ETR212 even made 203 km/h. The 219-kilometre journeys from Bologna to Milan were made in 77 minutes, in the Netherlands, Nederlandse Spoorwegen introduced the Materieel 34, a three unit 140 km/h streamlined diesel-electric trainset in 1934

The train featured extensive use of stainless steel, was originally named the Zephyr, and was meant as a promotional tool to advertise passenger rail service in the United States. The construction included <mark>innovation</mark>s such as shotwelding to join the stainless steel, for one section of the run it reached a speed of 112.5 mph, just short of the then US land speed record of 115 mph. The historic dash inspired a 1934 film and the trains nickname, the train entered the regular revenue service on November 11,1934, between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, and Lincoln, Nebraska. It operated this and other routes until its retirement in 1960, when it was donated to Chicagos Museum of Science and Industry, the train is generally regarded as the first successful streamliner on American railroads. In the early 1930s, the US was in the depths of the Great Depression, without the money to purchase new goods, freight trains were not hauling as much as they had in the previous decade. People who could not buy goods also could not afford to travel to the extent that they had before, automobile travel had increasingly cut into rail ridership since the mid-1920s, making faster, more efficient service imperative for railroads to compete. Railroads needed a way to re-energize the traveling public and offer a bit of hope for the days to come, the project hinged on two major elements, developing lighter railcars and developing an internal combustion driven power system adequate for high speed service. In 1932 Ralph Budd met Edward G. Budd, an automotive pioneer who was founder. Edward Budd was demonstrating his new Budd-Michelin rail motorcar built of stainless steel, since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost. On August 20,1932, Earl J. Shotwelding, as Ragsdale termed his method, in spot welding, the two pieces of metal that are to be joined are pressed together with an electrode on each side of the joint. A very high current is passed through the joint and fuses the two pieces of metal together. With their patented welding process at the core of stainless steel railcar construction, the existing powerplants for motorized railcars were completely inadequate. Contemporary four-stroke Diesel motors had unacceptably low power-to-weight ratios and were only efficient under a narrow range of operating conditions. Their efficient operating range was improved, owing largely to improvements in fuel injection developed by GM. A Diesel-electric system driven by the new motor was used to power General Motors automotive assembly exhibit at the 1933 Century of Progress Chicago Worlds Fair. Budd saw the compact, efficient system in action, saw a piece of his lightweight train puzzle fall into place. The result was a Diesel-electric drive system powered by an eight-cylinder,600 hp Winton 201A Diesel motor installed in a new three car stainless steel streamliner within a year. In 1933 a Century of Progress exhibit inspired the Zephyr streamliner, the year the new Zephyr streamliner inspired the Century of Progress fair

–
The R11 was a prototype class of experimental New York City Subway cars built by the Edward G. Budd Manufacturing Company in 1949. Because each one cost more than $100,000, the ten R11 cars are referred to as the Million Dollar Train. From 1964 to 1965, the ten R11 cars were overhauled in the Transit Authoritys own Coney Island Complex under contract R34, therefore, it is also acceptable to refer to the cars as R34s, provided one is referring to them in their post-overhaul state. The R11 was the first stainless steel R-type car ever built, fifteen years after the building of the R11s, the Budd Company built the first bulk order of stainless steel cars in New York City Subway history, the R32. On June 19,1947, the city announced the details of the $1,158,000 R11 subway car order, the equipment in the subway car was installed by Westinghouse Electric. The full size of the R11 contract was to have been for 400 new subway cars, however, the remainder of the cars were never built due to the halt of construction on Second Avenue shortly thereafter. The ornamental design of the car body featured standee windows separated by a brace from the lower windows. This was due to the influence of noted industrial designer Otto Kuhler, the cars also implemented new technology in several areas. Precipitron lamps were included, designed to combat airborne bacteria, forced air ventilation was introduced as ceiling vents circulated fresh air in from outside each car, while removing stale air. Electric door motors were used for the first time, replacing the standard compressed air engines which had served on much of the older equipment, however, these cars were also built with outside door operating apparatus or controls along with an exterior mounted Public Address microphone system. Lastly, drum brakes were installed instead of conventional tread brakes, the R11 cars were rebuilt in 1965 under contract R34. During the rebuild, the brakes were replaced with disk brakes, new fans were installed. The rebuild also included modifications that allowed the cars to operate in consists with other SMEE cars. Since there were ten of them, maintenance for the R11s proved time consuming and difficult by the 1970s, as special skills. As a result, the R11s were retired from service in 1977 following an accident that wrecked car 8016. The one exception is car 8013, which survives today at the New York Transit Museum, the car was restored to operating condition from 2013-2014 and made its first in-service run in 37 years on a nostalgia trip on August 3,2014, mated to R166387. Rainy weather the night before the run short-circuited the overhead wiring in the car. The wiring, along with a leak in the roof were repaired at the 207th Street Overhaul Shop

Michelin is a French tire manufacturer based in Clermont-Ferrand in the Auvergne région of France. It is one of the four largest tire manufacturers in the world along with Goodyear, Continental, in addition to the Michelin brand, it also owns the BFGoodrich, Kleber, Tigar, Riken, Kormoran and Uniroyal tire brands. Michelins numerous inventions include the removable tire, the pneurail and the radial tire, Michelin manufactures tires for space shuttles, aircraft, automobiles, heavy equipment, motorcycles, and bicycles. In 2012, the Group produced 166 million tires at 69 facilities located in 18 countries, in 1889 two brothers, Édouard Michelin and André Michelin, ran a rubber factory in Clermont-Ferrand, France. One day, a cyclist whose pneumatic tire needed repair turned up at the factory, the tire was glued to the rim, and it took over three hours to remove and repair the tire, which then needed to be left overnight to dry. The next day, Édouard Michelin took the repaired bicycle into the yard to test. After only a few hundred metres, the tire failed, despite the setback, Édouard was enthusiastic about the pneumatic tire, and he and his brother worked on creating their own version, one that did not need to be glued to the rim. Michelin was incorporated on 28 May 1889, in 1891 Michelin took out its first patent for a removable pneumatic tire which was used by Charles Terront to win the worlds first long distance cycle race, the 1891 Paris–Brest–Paris. In the 1920s and 1930s, Michelin operated large rubber plantations in Vietnam, conditions at these plantations led to the famous labour movement Phu Rieng Do. In 1934, Michelin introduced a tire which, if punctured, would run on a special foam lining, the radial was initially marketed as the X tire. It was developed with the front-wheel-drive Citroën Traction Avant and Citroën 2CV in mind, Michelin had bought the then-bankrupt Citroën in the 1930s. Because of its superiority in handling and fuel economy, use of this quickly spread throughout Europe. In the U. S. the outdated bias-ply tire persisted, also in 1968, Consumer Reports, an influential American magazine, acknowledged the superiority of the radial construction, setting off a rapid decline in Michelins competitor technology. In the U. S. the radial tire now has a share of 100%. In 1989, Michelin acquired the recently merged tire and rubber manufacturing divisions of the American firms B. F. Goodrich Company and Uniroyal, Uniroyal Australia had already been bought by Bridgestone in 1980. This purchase included the Norwood, North Carolina manufacturing plant which supplied tires to the U. S, Michelin also controls 90% of Taurus Tire in Hungary, as well as Kormoran, a Polish brand. As of 1 September 2008, Michelin is again the worlds largest tire manufacturer after spending two years as number two behind Bridgestone. Michelin produces tires in France, Spain, Germany, the USA, on 15 January 2010, Michelin announced the closing of its Ota, Japan plant, which employs 380 workers and makes the Michelin X-Ice tire

Michelines were a series of rubber-tyred trains developed in France in the 1930s by various rail companies and rubber-tyre manufacturer Michelin. Some Michelines were built in the United States by the Budd Company, most Michelines were self-propelled, but a number of locomotive-hauled trainsets were also produced. Furthermore, they were subject to flat tyres, unlike cars with steel wheels, however, as time went by, the extra complexity of rubber-tyred rolling stock meant that they were superseded by conventional steel-wheel rolling stock

The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad was a railroad that operated in the Midwestern United States. Its primary connections included Chicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul, St. Louis, Kansas City, because of this extensive trackage in the midwest and mountain states, the railroad used the advertising slogans Everywhere West, Way of the Zephyrs, and The Way West. It merged into Burlington Northern in 1970, in 1967, it reported 19,565 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 723 million passenger miles, corresponding totals for C&amp;S were 1,100 and 10 and for FW&amp;D were 1,466 and 13. At the end of the year CB&amp;Q operated 8,538 route-miles, C&amp;S operated 708, the earliest predecessor of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Aurora Branch Railroad, was chartered by act of the Illinois General Assembly on October 2,1848. The Aurora Branch was built from Aurora, through Batavia, to Turner Junction in what is now West Chicago, the line was built with old strap rail and minimal, if any, grading. The line from Aurora to Chicago was built through the towns of Naperville, Lisle, Downers Grove, Hinsdale, Berwyn. It was opened in 1864, and passenger and freight service began, regular commuter train service started in 1864 and remains operational to this day, making it the oldest surviving regular passenger service in Chicago. Both the original Chicago line, and to a lesser extent. With a steady acquisition of locomotives, cars, equipment, and trackage, the Burlington Route was able to enter the trade markets in 1862. From that year to date, the railroad and its successors have paid dividends continuously, the B&amp;MR continued building west into Nebraska as a separate company, the Burlington &amp; Missouri River Rail Road, founded in 1869. During the summer of 1870 it reached Lincoln, the designated capital of Nebraska and by 1872 it reached Kearney. That same year the B&amp;MR across Iowa was absorbed by the CB&amp;Q, by the time the Missouri River bridge at Plattsmouth, Nebraska was completed the B&amp;MR in Nebraska was well on its way to the Mile High city of Denver, Colorado. That same year, the Nebraska B&amp;MR was purchased by the CB&amp;Q, Burlingtons rapid expansion after the American Civil War was based upon sound financial management, dominated by John Murray Forbes of Boston and assisted by Charles Elliott Perkins. Perkins was an administrator who eventually forged a system out of previously loosely held affiliates. Ultimately, Perkins believed the Burlington Railroad must be included into a powerful transcontinental system, though the railroad as far west as Denver and Billings, Montana, it had failed to reach the Pacific Coast during the 1880s and 1890s, when construction was less expensive. Though approached by E. H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad, with its river line to the Twin Cities, the Burlington Route formed a natural connection between Hills home town of St. Paul, Minnesota, and the railroad hub of Chicago. Moreover, Hill was willing to meet Perkins $200-a-share asking price for the Burlingtons stock, by 1900, Hills Great Northern, in conjunction with the Northern Pacific Railway, held nearly 100 percent of Burlingtons stock. In 1901 a rebuffed Harriman tried to gain an indirect influence over the Burlington by launching a raid on the Northern Pacific

The streamliners are a class of streamlined railway cars built in the 1940s through the 1950s for long distance passenger railservices in North America. The first streamliner in the United States was the M-10000 in service with the Union Pacific Railroad in February 1934, the second was the Pioneer Zephyr in service with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Both were built as Diesel Multiple-Units, the M-10000 was made of aluminum, in 1944 American Car and Foundry was visited by the Spanish inventor Goicoechea looking for a manufacturer for his invention, the lightweight articulated streamlined Talgo. ACF and Goicoechea signed the contract on December 8,1945, ACF built the Talgo using a lightmetal body like Budds Pioneer Zephyr including the non-European observation cars at the rear. It wasnt until 1955 that ACF could sell the Talgo concept, after the Second World War the railroad companies in the United States wanted to modernize their fleets of passenger cars. They chose the flexibility of individual cars instead of multiple-units or Talgo, however the design of the streamlined cars was derived from the Pioneer Zephyr, although the Pullman cars got a smooth body surface and the others the typical ribbed body surface. Other US railroads followed and by 1955 the Canadian National Railway, in 1971 Amtrak received 1200 streamliner cars as heritage-fleet from the US railroads. After refurbishment the cars were used until the 1990s, with cars, chiefly baggage and dining cars. The Canadian Via Rail still operates trains with streamlined cars

A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from. It is a used in a variety of contexts, including semantics, design, electronics. A prototype is used to evaluate a new design to enhance precision by system analysts. Prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real, working system rather than a theoretical one, in some design workflow models, creating a prototype is the step between the formalization and the evaluation of an idea. The word prototype derives from the Greek πρωτότυπον prototypon, primitive form, neutral of πρωτότυπος prototypos, original, primitive, from πρῶτος protos, first and τύπος typos, a Working Prototype represents all or nearly all of the functionality of the final product. A Visual Prototype represents the size and appearance, but not the functionality, a User Experience Prototype represents enough of the appearance and function of the product that it can be used for user research. A Functional Prototype captures both function and appearance of the design, though it may be created with different techniques. A Paper Prototype is a printed or hand-drawn representation of the interface of a software product. In some cases, the final production materials may still be undergoing development themselves, process - Mass-production processes are often unsuitable for making a small number of parts, so prototypes may be made using different fabrication processes than the final product. Differences in fabrication process may lead to differences in the appearance of the prototype as compared to the final product, verification - The final product may be subject to a number of quality assurance tests to verify conformance with drawings or specifications. These tests may involve custom inspection fixtures, statistical sampling methods, prototypes are generally made with much closer individual inspection and the assumption that some adjustment or rework will be part of the fabrication process. Prototypes may also be exempted from some requirements that apply to the final product. Engineers and prototype specialists will attempt to minimize the impact of these differences on the role for the prototype. Engineers and prototyping specialists seek to understand the limitations of prototypes to exactly simulate the characteristics of their intended design and it is important to realize that by their very definition, prototypes will represent some compromise from the final production design. Due to differences in materials, processes and design fidelity, it is possible that a prototype may fail to perform acceptably whereas the design may have been sound. In general, it can be expected that individual prototype costs will be greater than the final production costs due to inefficiencies in materials. Prototypes are also used to revise the design for the purposes of reducing costs through optimization and it is possible to use prototype testing to reduce the risk that a design may not perform as intended, however prototypes generally cannot eliminate all risk. As an alternative, rapid prototyping or rapid application development techniques are used for the prototypes, which implement part

Rapid transit, also known as heavy rail, metro, subway, tube, or underground, is a type of high-capacity public transport generally found in urban areas. The stations typically have high platforms, without steps inside the trains and they are typically integrated with other public transport and often operated by the same public transport authorities. However, some transit systems have at-grade intersections between a rapid transit line and a road or between two rapid transit lines. It is unchallenged in its ability to transport large numbers of people quickly over short distances with little use of land, variations of rapid transit include people movers, small-scale light metro, and the commuter rail hybrid S-Bahn. The worlds first rapid-transit system was the partially underground Metropolitan Railway which opened as a railway in 1863. In 1868, New York opened the elevated West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway, china has the largest number of rapid transit systems in the world. The worlds longest single-operator rapid transit system by length is the Shanghai Metro. The worlds largest single rapid transit service provider by both length of revenue track (665 miles and number of stations is the New York City Subway. The busiest rapid transit systems in the world by annual ridership are the Tokyo subway system, the Seoul Metropolitan Subway, the Moscow Metro, the Beijing Subway, Metro is the most common term for underground rapid transit systems used by non-native English speakers. One of these terms may apply to a system, even if a large part of the network runs at ground level. In Scotland, however, the Glasgow Subway underground rapid transit system is known as the Subway, in the US, underground mass transit systems are primarily known as subways, whereas the term metro is a shortened reference to a metropolitan area. In that vein, Chicagos commuter rail system, serving the area, is called Metra. Exceptions in naming rapid transit systems are Washington DCs subway system the Washington Metro, Los Angeles Metro Rail, and the Miami Metrorail, the opening of Londons steam-hauled Metropolitan Railway in 1863 marked the beginning of rapid transit. Initial experiences with steam engines, despite ventilation, were unpleasant, experiments with pneumatic railways failed in their extended adoption by cities. Electric traction was more efficient, faster and cleaner than steam, in 1890 the City &amp; South London Railway was the first electric-traction rapid transit railway, which was also fully underground. Both railways were merged into London Underground. The 1893 Liverpool Overhead Railway was designed to use electric traction from the outset, budapest in Hungary and Glasgow, Chicago and New York all converted or purpose-designed and built electric rail services. Advancements in technology have allowed new automated services, hybrid solutions have also evolved, such as tram-train and premetro, which incorporate some of the features of rapid transit systems

The Second Avenue Subway is a New York City Subway line that runs under Second Avenue on the East Side of Manhattan. The proposed full line would be 8.5 miles long with 16 stations, the line was originally proposed in 1919 as part of a massive expansion of what would become the Independent Subway System. Work on the line never commenced, as the Great Depression crushed the economy, numerous plans for the Second Avenue Subway appeared throughout the 20th century, but these were usually deferred due to lack of funds. The line was proposed to replace the Second Avenue and Third Avenue elevated lines, although the new subway was not built, the elevated lines were demolished in 1942 and 1955, respectively. The first segment of the 63rd Street Lines, which opened in October 1989, work on the line restarted in 2007 following the development of a financially secure construction plan. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority awarded a contract for the first phase of the project to the consortium of Schiavone/Shea/Skanska on March 20,2007. This followed preliminary engineering and a final design completed by a joint venture between AECOM and Arup. Parsons Brinckerhoff served as the Construction Manager of the project, a full funding grant agreement with the Federal Transit Administration for the first phase of the project was received in November 2007. A ceremonial ground-breaking for the Second Avenue Subway was held on April 12,2007, the first phase of the line, consisting of three newly-built stations and two miles of tunnel, cost $4.45 billion. A1. 5-mile, $6 billion second phase is in planning and is expected to open by 2027–2029, Phase 1 is served by the Q train, which runs at all times. The N provides limited rush hour service on Phase 1, a second phase is planned to extend the line from 96th Street to 125th Street, and both the Q and limited N service will be extended to 125th Street when Phase 2 is built. A new T train will serve the line from 125th to Houston Streets at all times once Phase 3 is completed. The T will be extended to Hanover Square upon Phase 4s completion, the T will be colored turquoise since it will use the Second Avenue Line through Midtown Manhattan. Services that use the Second Avenue Line through Midtown Manhattan are to be colored turquoise, the following services use part or all of the Second Avenue Line, Phase 1 of the Second Avenue Line, which opened at the start of 2017, is entirely in Manhattan. It runs from Second Avenue and 65th Street to Second Avenue and it is double-tracked along its entire length, with both tracks in parallel tubes bored by tunnel boring machines. Phase 1 stations are located at 72nd Street, 86th Street, all of these stations use an island platform layout, with the platforms at each station located between the two tracks. Past 96th Street, both continue as storage tracks until they end at 105th Street. The Second Avenue Subway connects to the BMT Broadway Line, utilizing an existing connection via the 63rd Street Line as part of phase 1, the Q and N services operate northward from 57th Street–Seventh Avenue, curving east under Central Park on the 63rd Street Line

Chicago, officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois, and it is the county seat of Cook County. In 2012, Chicago was listed as a global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Chicago has the third-largest gross metropolitan product in the United States—about $640 billion according to 2015 estimates, the city has one of the worlds largest and most diversified economies with no single industry employing more than 14% of the workforce. In 2016, Chicago hosted over 54 million domestic and international visitors, landmarks in the city include Millennium Park, Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile, Art Institute of Chicago, Museum Campus, the Willis Tower, Museum of Science and Industry, and Lincoln Park Zoo. Chicagos culture includes the arts, novels, film, theater, especially improvisational comedy. Chicago also has sports teams in each of the major professional leagues. The city has many nicknames, the best-known being the Windy City, the name Chicago is derived from a French rendering of the Native American word shikaakwa, known to botanists as Allium tricoccum, from the Miami-Illinois language. The first known reference to the site of the current city of Chicago as Checagou was by Robert de LaSalle around 1679 in a memoir, henri Joutel, in his journal of 1688, noted that the wild garlic, called chicagoua, grew abundantly in the area. In the mid-18th century, the area was inhabited by a Native American tribe known as the Potawatomi, the first known non-indigenous permanent settler in Chicago was Jean Baptiste Point du Sable. Du Sable was of African and French descent and arrived in the 1780s and he is commonly known as the Founder of Chicago. In 1803, the United States Army built Fort Dearborn, which was destroyed in 1812 in the Battle of Fort Dearborn, the Ottawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi tribes had ceded additional land to the United States in the 1816 Treaty of St. Louis. The Potawatomi were forcibly removed from their land after the Treaty of Chicago in 1833, on August 12,1833, the Town of Chicago was organized with a population of about 200. Within seven years it grew to more than 4,000 people, on June 15,1835, the first public land sales began with Edmund Dick Taylor as U. S. The City of Chicago was incorporated on Saturday, March 4,1837, as the site of the Chicago Portage, the city became an important transportation hub between the eastern and western United States. Chicagos first railway, Galena and Chicago Union Railroad, and the Illinois, the canal allowed steamboats and sailing ships on the Great Lakes to connect to the Mississippi River. A flourishing economy brought residents from rural communities and immigrants from abroad, manufacturing and retail and finance sectors became dominant, influencing the American economy. The Chicago Board of Trade listed the first ever standardized exchange traded forward contracts and these issues also helped propel another Illinoisan, Abraham Lincoln, to the national stage

Chicago Union Station is a major railroad station that opened in 1925 in Chicago, Illinois, replacing an earlier station built in 1881. It is the only remaining intercity rail terminal in Chicago, as well as being the primary terminal for commuter trains. The station stands on the west side of the Chicago River between West Adams Street and West Jackson Boulevard, just outside the Chicago Loop, including approach and storage tracks, it is about nine and a half city blocks in size. Its facilities are underground, buried beneath streets and skyscrapers. Chicago Union Station is the third-busiest rail terminal in the United States, after Grand Central Terminal and it is Amtraks overall fourth-busiest station. It handles approximately 120,000 passengers on a weekday and is one of Chicago’s most iconic structures, reflecting the city’s strong architectural heritage. In addition to standing out architecturally, Union Station has features that reflect its commitment to sustainability, in 2011, its lighting system was replaced with more energy-efficient light bulbs and motion sensors, reducing the station’s <mark>carbon</mark> footprint by 4 million tons annually. Chicago Union Station was designated as one of America’s “Great Places” in 2012 by the American Planning Association. The “Great Places” program by APA highlights places streets, neighborhoods, and public spaces around America that exhibit “exemplary character, quality, and planning. ”These places are unique in their cultural and historical significance, sense of community, and vision. Other criteria include “architectural features, accessibility, functionality, and community involvement. ”Chicago Union Station is considered a “Great Public Space” by APA and these spaces are safe and inviting, well-maintained, and attractive, both visually and in functionality. In addition, local culture and history are reflected within the space, Union Station is laid out with a double stub-end configuration, with 10 tracks coming into the station from the north and 14 from the south. Because passenger trains do not pass through Union Station, all passengers traveling through Chicago must change trains to reach their final destination. There are 2 through tracks to allow out-of-service equipment moves between the north and south side, including one with a platform to allow extra long trains to board, between the north and south sides of the station is a passenger concourse. Passengers can walk through the concourse to get from any platform to any other without stairs or elevators, odd-numbered platforms are on the north half of the station, and even-numbered platforms on the south half. The north tracks are used by Amtrak for the Hiawatha Service and the Empire Builder, and by Metra for the Milwaukee District West, Milwaukee District North, the south tracks are used for all of the other Amtrak and Metra services. Two station management structures, one on side of the terminal, monitor train-to-track assignments. The concourse also has a level between platform and street level, containing a food court featuring local vendors as well as national chains.

Air conditioning is the process of removing heat from a confined space, thus cooling the air, and removing humidity. Air conditioning can be used in domestic and commercial environments. Air conditioners often use a fan to distribute the air to an occupied space such as a building or a car to improve thermal comfort. The cooling is achieved through a refrigeration cycle, but sometimes evaporation or free cooling is used. Air conditioning systems can also be based on desiccants and subterraneous pipes that can distribute the heated refrigerant to the ground for cooling. In the most general sense, air conditioning can refer to any form of technology that modifies the condition of air, in common usage, though, air conditioning refers to systems which cool air. In construction, a system of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning is referred to as heating, ventilation. Since prehistoric times, snow and ice were used for cooling, the business of harvesting ice during winter and storing for use in summer became popular towards the late 17th century. This practice was replaced by mechanical ice-making machines, the basic concept behind air conditioning is said to have been applied in ancient Egypt, where reeds were hung in windows and were moistened with trickling water. The evaporation of water cooled the air blowing through the window and this process also made the air more humid, which can be beneficial in a dry desert <mark>climate</mark>. In Ancient Rome, water from aqueducts was circulated through the walls of houses to cool them. Other techniques in medieval Persia involved the use of cisterns and wind towers to cool buildings during the hot season. The 2nd-century Chinese inventor Ding Huan of the Han Dynasty invented a fan for air conditioning, with seven wheels 3 m in diameter. During the subsequent Song Dynasty, written sources mentioned the air conditioning rotary fan as even more widely used, in the 17th century, Cornelis Drebbel demonstrated Turning Summer into Winter for James I of England by adding salt to water. The introduction of air conditioning in the 1920s helped enable the great migration to the Sun Belt in the United States. In 1758, Benjamin Franklin and John Hadley, a professor at Cambridge University. Franklin and Hadley confirmed that evaporation of volatile liquids could be used to drive down the temperature of an object past the freezing point of water. They conducted their experiment with the bulb of a mercury thermometer as their object and they lowered the temperature of the thermometer bulb down to −14 °C while the ambient temperature was 18 °C

The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, often abbreviated as Santa Fe or AT&amp;SF, was one of the larger railroads in the United States. Chartered in February 1859, the reached the Kansas-Colorado border in 1873 and Pueblo, Colorado. To create a demand for its services, the set up real estate offices. Despite the name, its main line never served Santa Fe, New Mexico, as the terrain was too difficult, the Santa Fe was a pioneer in intermodal freight transport, an enterprise that included a tugboat fleet and an airline. Its bus line extended passenger transportation to areas not accessible by rail, the AT&amp;SF was the subject of a popular song, Harry Warren &amp; Johnny Mercers On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe, written for the film, The Harvey Girls. The railroad officially ceased operations on December 31,1996, when it merged with the Burlington Northern Railroad to form the Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway. The Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway was chartered on February 11,1859, to join Atchison and Topeka, Kansas, with Santa Fe, in its early years, the railroad opened Kansas to settlement. Much of its revenue came from wheat grown there and from cattle driven north from Texas to Wichita, rather than turn its survey southward at Dodge City, AT&amp;SF headed southwest over Raton Pass because of coal deposits near Trinidad, Colorado and Raton, New Mexico. D&amp;RG paid an estimated $1.4 million to Santa Fe for its work within the Gorge and agreed not to extend its line to Santa Fe, while Santa Fe agreed to forego its planned routes to Denver and Leadville. Building across Kansas and eastern Colorado was simple, with few natural obstacles and it set up real estate offices in the area and promoted settlement across Kansas on the land that was granted to it by Congress in 1863. It offered discounted fares to anyone who traveled west to land, if the land was purchased. AT&amp;SF reached Albuquerque in 1880, Santa Fe, the destination of the railroad, found itself on a short branch from Lamy. In March 1881 AT&amp;SF connected with the Southern Pacific at Deming, New Mexico, the railroad then built southwest from Benson, Arizona, to Nogales on the Mexican border where it connected with the Sonora Railway, which the AT&amp;SF had built north from the Mexican port of Guaymas. The Atlantic &amp; Pacific Railroad was chartered in 1866 to build west from Springfield, Missouri, the infant A&amp;P had no rail connections. The line that was to become the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway would not reach Springfield for another four years, A&amp;P started construction in 1868, built southwest into what would become Oklahoma, and promptly entered receivership. In 1879 A&amp;P struck a deal with the Santa Fe and Frisco railroads to construct a line for each. The railroads would jointly build and own the A&amp;P railroad west of Albuquerque, in 1883 A&amp;P reached Needles, California, where it connected with an SP line. A&amp;P also built a line between Tulsa, Oklahoma and St. Louis, Missouri for the Frisco, but the Tulsa-Albuquerque portion remained unbuilt, by January 1890, the entire system consisted of some 7,500 miles of track

                            In the last decade, wide research was carried out on developing light-weight materials with improved mechanical properties, for instance comparable specific stiffness and strength, improved isolation, superior vibration and sound damping properties. To satisfy the increasing demands, Metal-Polymer-Metal Laminates have been numerously developed. Here, a short background of composites structures is presented.
