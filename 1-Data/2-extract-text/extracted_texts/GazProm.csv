San Francisco and Oakland allege &quot;public nuisance&quot; and are suing to win compensation for that nuisance. This is the usual category for environmental-harm suits, the same legal theory by which localities have sued over lead <mark>pollution</mark>, water <mark>pollution</mark> and the like. It was also the <A href=""http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-lead-paint-ruling-20171115-story.html"">basis for the successful legal action</A> taken against lead-paint producers in the same area. According to Bookbinder, the claim &quot;simply requires demonstrating that the defendant contributed to a condition that constitutes an unreasonable interference with public rights.&quot;</P><P>The other plaintiffs — namely, San Mateo County, Marin County and Imperial Beach — are employing a much more scattershot strategy, not only in the number of defendants that they name (nearly 40), but in alleging &quot;design defect, failure to warn, negligence and trespass&quot; in addition to public nuisance. This approach gives juries multiple routes to a ruling against the energy companies, but it could backfire, with so many claims being made against such a wide variety of defendants that none of the blows really land.</P><P>So what's the problem? The Union of Concerned Scientists, the activist group that has spearheaded this push for legal action, has compared energy companies' behavior with that of tobacco companies decades ago. The comparison reveals two fundamental issues with the suits.</P><P>First, unlike smoking, energy is a basic good. <EM>Some</EM> form of energy is necessary to do just about anything, including to meet essential needs such as heating or cooling a home (which in some places is a genuine safety issue). There is an inherent trade-off between affordable energy and environmental harm, and it makes no sense to ask judges and juries rather than elected legislators to strike the right balance.</P><P>Second, a key allegation against cigarette companies was that they hid and denied the harms of smoking, but the parallel allegations against the energy companies are contradictory. We are expected to believe that energy companies covered up the damage done by fossil fuels — and yet publicly available, industry-funded research is cited as evidence that the companies were aware of the harms they were causing. For instance, San Mateo County's lawsuit notes that Exxon made its <mark>climate</mark> findings public in peer-reviewed science journals by 1982.</P><P>Another obstacle is the fact that energy companies have government-granted permits to do what they do, a fact that some courts have found highly relevant. In North Carolina vs. Tennessee Valley Authority, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit dismissed a common-law nuisance action on the grounds that &quot;there is a distinction between an activity that is merely not illegal vs. one that is explicitly granted a permit to operate in a particular fashion.&quot; The opinion further notes, citing New England Legal Foundation vs. Costle, that &quot;courts traditionally have been reluctant to enjoin as a public nuisance activities which have been considered and specifically authorized by the government.&quot;</P><P>Local lawsuits also struggle to address the global scope of the <mark>climate</mark>-change problem. According to a <A href=""https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10584-017-1978-0.pdf"">study</A> that is often drawn upon to make the case for liability, the two largest contributors to the rise in <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions since 1980 are Saudi Aramco and <mark>Gazprom</mark>: the state-owned oil companies of Saudi Arabia and Russia. The initial San Mateo suit did name Statoil, a company majority-owned by the Norwegian government, as a defendant, but even this was dropped in an effort to keep the case in state, as opposed to federal, court.</P><P>As the legal scholar <A href=""https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/02/08/santelli-exchange-big-oil-vs-municipalities.html"">Richard Epstein puts it</A>, &quot;If you're going to need a system of regulation, you can do that in a thousand different ways, but erratic, independent lawsuits in separate courts by separate people is the wrong way to go.&quot; This approach is likely to cause backlash that derails real, <mark>sustainable</mark> reforms to protect the environment.</P><P><I>Jibran Khan is a journalism fellow at the National Review Institute. </I></P><H3 id=""whatsyourview"" class=""align--center"">What's your view?</H3><P>Got an opinion about this issue? <A href=""http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/2017/02/09/submit-letter-editor"">Send a letter to the editor</A>, and you just might get published.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""wrapper group""><DIV class=""row-xl row-l""><DIV class=""col-xl-2-5 col-xl-push-1 col-l-2-4 col-l-push-1 art-footer-comments""><DIV class=""art-footer-comments__wrapper / is-expanded was-expanded expand__target / js-article__comments-wrapper""><SECTION class=""js-article__comments-conversation"" id=""conversation""><BUTTON class=""art-footer-comments__button js-expand-comments"" data-comments-config=""{&quot;CONV_CONFIG&quot;:{&quot;articleId&quot;:&quot;AWJ3yqCcvd-XO9Qpcw9O&quot;,&quot;collectionMeta&quot;:&quot;eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0eXBlIjoibGl2ZWNvbW1lbnRzIiwiYXJ0aWNsZUlkIjoiQVdKM3lxQ2N2ZC1YTzlRcGN3OU8iLCJ0aXRsZSI6Ikxhd3N1aXRzIGFyZSBhIHBvb3Igd2F5IHRvIGFkZHJlc3MgY2xpbWF0ZSBjaGFuZ2UiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tXC9vcGluaW9uXC9jb21tZW50YXJ5XC8yMDE4XC8wNFwvMDJcL2xhd3N1aXRzLXBvb3Itd2F5LWFkZHJlc3MtY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2UiLCJpc3MiOiJ1cm46bGl2ZWZ5cmU6ZG1uZXdzLmZ5cmUuY286c2l0ZT0zNzk4OTgifQ.SEG-lhi41Eb0ju3CSHrZjSwqULaRf4dPpUkCCQBcSGU&quot;,&quot;checksum&quot;:&quot;6987680df517816313baa3b6453bbc94&quot;}}""><SVG class=""art-footer-comments__button-icon icon""><SPAN class=""art-footer-comments__button-text"">View Comments</SPAN></SVG></BUTTON></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

Originally also charged with piracy, that charge against the Arctic 30 was dropped by Russian prosecutors.</P><P>A ruling in November by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ordered Russia to allow the Arctic 30 to leave the country immediately and to release the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, as soon as a bond of 3.6 million euros in the form of a bank guarantee was paid. That bond was posted by the Government of the Netherlands – where the Arctic Sunrise is registered – on November 29. The ship is still in Russian hands and Russia is now in defiance of that order.</P><P>While the Arctic 30 were in prison, first in Murmansk and later in St. Petersburg, <mark>Gazprom</mark> was not idle.</P><P>Today the Russian oil giant announced it has produced the first commercial quantities of oil from its Arctic drilling platform Prirazlomnaya in the remote waters of the Pechora Sea.</P><P>Oil production at Prirazlomnaya is the first commercial oil extraction from the Arctic shelf anywhere in the world.</P><P>The Prirazlomnaya platform was the focus of the Greenpeace protest in September which led to the arrest and imprisonment of the Arctic 30.</P><P>In response, Greenpeace said that the “clock is ticking” on a major environmental accident in the Arctic region.</P><P>One of the Arctic 30, Faiza Oulahsen of the Netherlands, said, “This is a dark day for the Arctic. <mark>Gazprom</mark> is the first company on Earth to pump oil from beneath icy Arctic waters and yet its safety record on land is appalling. It is impossible to trust them to drill safely in one of the most fragile and beautiful regions on Earth.”</P><P>“This is why I have spent the last two months of my life in jail, but I am just one of millions who oppose this reckless oil rush,” said Oulahsen. “We must stop this trickle of Arctic oil before it becomes a flood.”</P><DIV id=""attachment_47946"" style=""width: 360px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text""><mark>Gazprom</mark>’s Prirazlomnaya platform (Photo courtesy <mark>Gazprom</mark>)</P></DIV><P>“The timing of this announcement is intriguing, to say the least. When <mark>Gazprom</mark> called the authorities and instructed them to arrest us, they never bargained for the global outrage they sparked. Now we are going home and <mark>Gazprom</mark> is licking its wounds,” said Oulahsen.</P><P>“Announcing they have started producing oil does not dissuade us, it makes us more determined than ever to grow this global movement to save the Arctic. We’ve already discovered more oil than we’ll ever need if we’re going to avoid dangerous <mark>climate change</mark>. Looking for more of the stuff in the beautiful fragile Arctic is an act of extreme folly,” she said.</P><P>The offshore Arctic is characterized by freezing temperatures, thick ice, months of constant twilight, giant storms and hurricane-force winds that pose technical risks to any oil company. Greenpeace warns, “There is no proven way of cleaning oil spilled in ice and even a small accident would have devastating consequences on the Arctic’s fragile and little-understood environment.”</P><P>To realize its goal of opening up more of the Arctic to oil exploration, which Russia aims to turn into its “resource base of the 21st century,” <mark>Gazprom</mark> has signed an exploration deal with Shell that will provide it with new capital and much-needed expertise in offshore drilling, even though Shell’s own 2012 attempts to drill in the Alaskan Arctic were marked by a series of repeated accidents and embarrassing safety blunders.</P><P>Yet this deal represents a huge financial and reputational risk for Shell and its investors.</P><P>A recent report written by Greenpeace, Share Action and Platform examined at the risks posed by Shell’s deal with <mark>Gazprom</mark>.

Unlike snow or ice, permafrost consists of soil and can't melt entirely, just as a frozen chicken wouldn't melt away on your countertop. It can, however, shrink or swell with changing temperatures, affecting the structures built atop it.</P><P>&quot;When you put something on the ground in a permafrost region, eventually it will end up underground,&quot; said Dmitry Streletskiy, a research scientist at George Washington University and an expert on permafrost and <mark>climate change</mark>. &quot;When permafrost is warming -- maybe not even thawing -- it won't be able to support as much weight.&quot;</P><P>That can cause oil pipelines to slouch as the ground recedes in a process called subsidence. A separate phenomenon, frost heaving, can cause vertical pipeline supports or &quot;piles&quot; to rise in icier areas, Streletskiy explained. If pronounced enough, the ground level differences can warp steel pipelines until they break.</P><P>Soil subsidence may have contributed to the 1994 pipeline accident near Usinsk in northern Russia, which spewed more than 160,000 tons of oil in one of the largest land spills ever.</P><SECTION class=""ad medium""><P class=""label"">Advertisement</P></SECTION><P>Correcting pipeline damage and deformations costs the Russian oil and gas industry $1.8 billion annually, according to a 2010 Greenpeace report. The study stated there are 35,000 pipeline accidents a year in oil-rich West Siberia.</P><P>&quot;When the permafrost melts, you get the destruction of infrastructure, and that's going to become a greater and greater concern all over Russia in terms of its built infrastructure for oil,&quot; said Deborah Gordon, a nonresident senior associate in the Energy and <mark>Climate</mark> Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</P><P>Pipelines are particularly vulnerable to climatic variations because they cover such great distances -- more than 215,000 miles in Siberia alone. OAO <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s Unified Gas Supply System spans nearly 100,000 miles and crosses everything from bedrock to ice. The Russian oil giant recently <A href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20130129-704891.html"">announced</A> it would spend an additional $17 billion to expand its South Stream pipeline project to bring gas to southeastern Europe via the Black Sea.</P><P>But some analysts have criticized Russia's approach to marketing its oil and natural gas, particularly its vast expenditures on infrastructure. More tellingly, Russia's government is becoming increasingly dependent on oil and gas revenues to balance its budget. And because Russia is a price taker for oil, it has surprisingly little influence on the world market despite being the world's largest oil producer.</P><P>&quot;As goes the price of oil, goes the fate of Russian stability,&quot; Gordon said.</P><H3>Sink or swim</H3><P>Permafrost may be thawing faster than previously expected, according to a U.N. Environment Programme study released during last year's <mark>climate change</mark> talks in Doha, Qatar (<A href=""http://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/2012/11/27/archive/6""><EM><mark>Climate</mark>Wire</EM></A>, Nov. 27, 2012). <mark>Carbon</mark> dioxide and methane trapped in the frozen soil, once released, could accelerate the warming trends already witnessed in the Arctic.</P><P>&quot;If you didn't think pipelines could swim, you'll see it in Russia,&quot; said Thane Gustafson, senior director of Russian and Caspian energy for IHS CERA and author of the new book &quot;Wheel of Fortune: The Battle for Oil and Power in Russia.&quot; &quot;The Russians are very familiar with permafrost, and they have developed engineering techniques to deal with permafrost -- but that's when you're building <EM>on</EM> it, not sinking <EM>into</EM> it,&quot; he added during a panel last week at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C.</P><P>Gustafson warns that declining Soviet-era infrastructure coupled with shrinking oil rents could combine to destabilize Russia if nothing is done.</P><P>But while the thought of swimming pipelines paints a vivid picture, &quot;floating&quot; pipes are only occasionally observed in wetlands in northern West Siberia, according to <mark>Gazprom</mark>. The state-owned Russian company attributes that phenomenon not to <mark>climate change</mark> but to insufficient weight-ballast placed on the 30- to 40-year-old pipes, an issue that the company's subsidiaries fix whenever it comes up.</P><P>&quot;Monitoring the state of permafrost soil in Western Siberia has not yet identified [trends] to their melting beyond the scope of regular oscillations,&quot; <mark>Gazprom</mark> said in a statement, adding that &quot;permafrost in the region will continue for many decades, even under the most adverse of the available forecast scenarios of <mark>climate change</mark> on the planet.&quot;</P><P>But Oleg Anisimov, head of the climatological department of Russia's State Hydrological Institute in St. Petersburg and an expert on permafrost, dismissed <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s statement as linguistic sleight of hand. &quot;Permafrost is something that was developing over millennial time scales, and it will not disappear in a click,&quot; he said. &quot;But what happens when <mark>climate</mark> becomes warmer? This is what <mark>Gazprom</mark> doesn't take into account: They treat <mark>climate change</mark> as <mark>climate</mark> variation.&quot;</P><P>Pipelines designed in the 1970s or '80s were built to withstand standard temperature deviations as a buffer against sinking into the permafrost during warmer seasons. But the temperature increases brought on by <mark>climate change</mark> could test the limits of old pipelines and leave <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s emergency response strategy overwhelmed.</P><P>Such a drastic deterioration wouldn't happen overnight. Anisimov has suggested that <mark>Gazprom</mark>, one of the world's largest companies, may delay any expensive, large-scale renovations until they become an economic imperative.</P><P>&quot;It's a cost-benefit analysis,&quot; he said. &quot;How much will it cost to reinforce the structure [versus] how much will it cost to fix the problems if something goes wrong?&quot;</P><P>Streletskiy pointed out that it would take just &quot;one major spill&quot; for the Russian oil industry to re-examine its pipeline infrastructure. Still, the George Washington University researcher is optimistic that Russian oil and gas producers will shore up pipelines in West Siberia before any disasters. He thinks they will turn to relatively inexpensive options such as thermosyphons, which use continuous evaporation and condensation to protect permafrost. Thermosyphons have been used successfully in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and on several northern roads.</P><P>&quot;Maintaining a pipeline system is much cheaper than replacing it, so I'm sure these solutions will be implemented eventually,&quot; Streletskiy said.</P></SECTION><SECTION class=""promo_container trial_promo""><H1>Like what you see?</H1><H2 class=""bottom_1 global_red"">Start a free trial now.</H2><P class=""bottom_1"">Get access to our comprehensive, daily coverage of energy and environmental politics and policy.</P></SECTION></SECTION></ARTICLE></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

Moreover, the EU says, <mark>Gazprom</mark> abused its dominant market position to try to keep control of the Yamal transit pipeline across Poland, and to bully Bulgaria into supporting South Stream, a now-cancelled Kremlin project to bring gas across the Black Sea into the EU.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> had put out feelers to Brussels in previous months to see if it could reach a settlement. But those talks broke down amid the freeze in East-West relations over Ukraine. Now <mark>Gazprom</mark> has 12 weeks to deal with the charges—by rebuttal, concessions or both. If it fails to satisfy the commission, the next stage is enforcement. This could mean fines of €1 billion ($1.1 billion) or more—in theory up to 10% of its turnover—and legally mandated changes to its business model. Such options are still in reserve. “All roads are open,” says Ms Vestager. “We would like <mark>Gazprom</mark> to answer and we would like to talk.”</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>’s initial response was icy. It said the EU’s complaint was “unfounded”, insisted that it already abides by international law and the domestic legislation of the countries where it does business, and argued that the dispute should be settled at a governmental level. <mark>Gazprom</mark> was established “beyond the jurisdiction of the EU”, it noted. Revealingly, it said that Russian law gave it “special, socially significant functions…and the status of a strategic government-controlled business entity”. Back in 2012 President Vladimir Putin banned such “strategic” companies from disclosing information to foreign regulators or obeying their orders.</P><P>The EU began its move against <mark>Gazprom</mark> with the launch of the “Third Energy Package” in 2007. That was a deceptively bland title for a series of measures that “unbundled”—in fact, upended—Europe’s energy market. The main effect was to ban the same company from owning both the gas pipelines and the molecules that flow through them. Russia objected harshly to this, seeing it as a politicised, unprovoked and confiscatory attack on <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s assets and business model.</P><P>However, rather like Microsoft, which fell foul of EU competition law for bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system, the company and its political masters did not grasp the EU’s ferocious prosecutorial powers. And the more the EU looked at Russian gas imports, the less it liked what it saw. In 2011, in the biggest antitrust raid in the EU’s history, officials with search warrants seized documents and computers from dozens of offices belonging to <mark>Gazprom</mark> and its affiliates. In 2012 the EU followed this up by opening a formal investigation.</P><P>The statement of objections has been largely ready since 2013, but was subject to a long and timorous delay. Ms Vestager’s predecessor, Joaquín Almunia, repeatedly promised to launch charges, but left office in November with that pledge unfulfilled. Senior people in the commission thought a deal would be better than worsening relations with Russia.</P><P>Now Europe is in a more robust frame of mind. Ms Vestager, a steely Dane, insists that her directorate is part of the justice system and acts without fear or favour. The move against <mark>Gazprom</mark> came only a week after it launched a statement of objections against another corporate giant, Google.</P><P>For <mark>Gazprom</mark> the most petulant option would be to ignore the EU. That brings speedy penalties—and also potential lawsuits from customers who have been overcharged, notes Alan Riley, a British law professor. Another option is to mount legal challenges—including ones claiming abuse of property rights. Vaclav Bartuska, the Czech Republic’s energy envoy, forecasts a climbdown, masked by a showy but empty deal on future exports to China to show the Russian public that the Kremlin is punishing Europe for its impudence.</P><P>Russia may also press ahead with <A href=""http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21647939-hungary-and-greece-are-joining-turkey-new-route-russian-gas-twist-pipeline"" target=""_blank"">Turk Stream</A>, a Black Sea pipeline which would deliver gas just as far as the Turkey-Greece border, to avoid the EU rules that stymied South Stream. The Kremlin is wooing Greece to support the project, with a $5 billion sweetener. More such divide-and-rule tactics in Europe are likely: Russia’s pipelines export political influence even when they are still mere lines on a map.</P><P>But turning off the gas taps, to punish the EU, seems unlikely. Russia is losing market share in Europe already, and cannot afford to annoy its customers or endanger its $40 billion export revenues.</P><P class=""xhead"">A cold <mark>climate</mark></P><P>Worries about dependence on Russian gas have in any case diminished. Not only is the winter over but Europe is generally in better shape to withstand a Russian tantrum. It has improved storage, and built north-south gas links, so that a cut in shipments across, say, Ukraine, can be made up with other supplies. Lithuania, once wholly dependent on Russian gas, has built a terminal to import liquefied natural gas (LNG), gaining a swift price cut from <mark>Gazprom</mark>. This year America will start LNG exports, creating yet more supply options.</P><P>For Mr Putin, the commission’s move underlines the scale of Russia’s isolation. Trust and patience have ebbed, even in Germany. His friends are fewer in number. By using energy as a weapon, he has prompted defence and counter-attack. The bear is not as feared as it was.</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

PGNiG here presents possible remedies to address excessive pricing applied by the Russian energy giant in some CEE countries.</P><P><EM>This op-ed was submitted by the Polish Oil and Gas Company (PGNiG).</EM></P><P>For the past decade <A href=""https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/opinion/<mark>gazprom</mark>-in-central-and-eastern-europe-a-long-history-of-exploitation/""><mark>Gazprom</mark> has been exploiting its CEE customers</A> by imposing contractual price formulas linking the price of gas in a given contract to the price of oil or oil-based products.</P><P>Despite dynamic development of the gas markets during the last decade and increasing role of gas trading in liquid gas hubs (like TTF or NBP), <mark>Gazprom</mark> still insists on indexing gas prices to oil prices in its long-term contracts.</P><P>In its contracts with the customers in the Baltic States, Poland, and Bulgaria, <mark>Gazprom</mark> enforced oil-indexed price formulas that resulted in prices significantly higher than in, for example, Germany and Italy (note that the transport costs to Poland and Baltic States are significantly lower) or gas hubs (like TTF).</P><P><STRONG><mark>Gazprom</mark>’s proposal</STRONG></P><P>In order to address the issue of excessive prices, <mark>Gazprom</mark>, in its commitment proposal accepted by the European Commission, proposed to include a price revision clause into long-term contracts with its customers from CEE.</P><P>According to the proposal, customers will be able to ask for price revision every two years (plus extraordinary revision once every five years if the conditions on “European gas markets” change. Reference to “European gas markets” can be understood as:</P><UL><LI>Prices in the “relevant, generally recognised liquid gas hubs”,</LI><LI>Import prices of Germany, France, and Italy.</LI></UL><P>If <mark>Gazprom</mark> and the customer do not reach an agreement within 120 days, the customer can initiate an arbitration proceedings.</P><P><STRONG>Analysis of <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s proposition</STRONG></P><P>The first thing that should be noted when assessing <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s proposal is the fact that the company does not promise to stop excessive pricing. It merely says: “if you do not like the price formula – negotiate and/or go to arbitration court and, maybe the latter will grant you a better formula”.</P><P>Therefore, this proposal does not meet a fundamental legal condition deriving from Regulation 1/2003 – namely, bringing infringement to an effective end. The rationale behind adopting the commitment decision by the Commission (instead of prohibition decision) is to swiftly interrupt the questioned practice – while the commitment proposed by <mark>Gazprom</mark> and initially accepted by the Commission comes nowhere near this objective.</P><P>Price revision clauses are already present in <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s long-term contracts, including contracts with CEE customers. Moreover, their wording does not exclude reference – in the course of price revision – to hub prices or import prices in Germany, Italy or France.</P><P>Therefore, <mark>Gazprom</mark> is offering something that is already available to the customers, while at the same time announcing (see Ms Burmistrova’s speech at Flame Conference 2017 in Amsterdam) that it will not change its pricing policy (especially in terms of indexing gas prices to oil-based products).</P><P>Another fundamental flaw in the proposed clause is the lack of retroactive effect of the revision clause. Retroactive effect allows the customer to request that the revision  is made retroactively (when justified) from the day of submitting the revision request, regardless of the actual date of an agreement or arbitration award.</P><P>This is already a well-established market standard in long-term contracts, including <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s.  If it weren’t the case, the supplier would have no incentive to accept the revision request in the course of negotiation. It would always be more profitable to obstruct the revision process for as long as possible and keep profits from excessive price to yourself</P><P>Putting such a proposal on the table perfectly shows <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s attitude to the antitrust proceeding – use it to its own advantage through proposing something that is even worse than the current market standard, and hope that the Commission will not notice. After all <mark>Gazprom</mark> can always argue it did its best.</P><P><STRONG>PGNiG’s counterproposal</STRONG></P><P>Excessive pricing is probably the most difficult practice to address by a competition authority like DG COMP. If this practice is not interrupted before closing of antitrust proceedings, adopting a prohibition decision theoretically should require assessing certain prices as “non-excessive”.</P><P>However, DG COMP – as rightly stated by Commissioner Vestager at Chillin’ Competition Conference 2016 – is not a price regulator. Nevertheless, due to the specifics of long-term contracts, it is possible to impose an effective remedy on <mark>Gazprom</mark> and allow almost immediate introduction of market-based prices in CEE. Furthermore, by using the same mechanism, the Commission may achieve full removal the effects of past overpricing.</P><P>The said mechanism is based on one -shot shift of the right to impose price formula – from seller (<mark>Gazprom</mark>) to purchaser – with an almost immediate entry into force of the new formula.</P><P>To guarantee that this measure is not used as a retaliation of customers over the <mark>Gazprom</mark> for its long-time anti-competitive practice, , the latter should be entitled to refer the case to an arbitration court if the new price formula produces non-market price. In arbitration court, <mark>Gazprom</mark> would have to prove that the price is too low and that the formula should be changed.</P><P><STRONG>Summary</STRONG></P><P>PGNiG’s counterproposal – contrary to the <mark>Gazprom</mark> one – allows to effectively end the pricing infringement and bring prices for CEE customers in line with market-price level (as enjoyed by <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s customers from Western Europe), and it does not require the Commission to take a role of a price regulator. It is a rational and moderate measure that allows to ensure fair prices for customers while preserving the rights of <mark>Gazprom</mark> as a supplier, which should be the main goal of the Commission in the antitrust proceedings.</P><P><EM>The text of PGNiG reply to the market test can be found </EM><A href=""http://www.pgnig.pl/documents/10184/1749782/20170519_PGNiG_observations_FINAL_public_version.pdf/27baab84-af99-45b2-bbce-b896ae2ea790""><EM>here</EM></A><EM>.</EM></P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the issue during Kern's visit to an economic forum in St Petersburg this month, Der Standard said, citing insiders, Reuters reported.
OMV and <mark>Gazprom</mark> had signed an outline deal in the Russian city to coordinate &quot;the development of the gas transmission infrastructure required for providing natural gas supplies to central and southeastern Europe&quot;.
A source familiar with the plans told Reuters it was too early to talk about project costs and investments. If realized, the project would likely boost the importance of OMV's Baumgarten gas hub, which distributes around 57 billion cubic meters a year.
Der Standard said the project would be an extension of the TurkStream pipeline, which <mark>Gazprom</mark> plans to finish by the end of 2019. The extended line could pump Russian gas to Italy, which currently receives supplies from Baumgarten via the TAG and SOL pipelines.
Alternatively, Russian gas could go from western Turkey via Greece to Italy.
Spokesmen for OMV and Kern declined to comment. <mark>Gazprom</mark> had no immediate comment.
Russia scrapped the South Stream pipeline project, which would have supplied Russian gas to southern Europe with an undersea pipeline to Bulgaria, in late 2014 because of objections from the European Union on competition grounds.
The dispute between Brussels and Moscow followed Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and the imposition of western economic sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine conflict.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article-tags""><DIV class=""label"">Topics</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

<mark>Gazprom</mark>, official partner of Fifa and the 2018 World Cup, announced the opening of the sixth season of the Football for Friendship International Children's Social Project. The project has been launched in Bangladesh for the second time. The goal of the programme is to involve the young generation throughout the world in promoting the most important human values among their peers - friendship, equality, peace and respect for different cultures and nationalities.
The Football for Friendship open draw was held in Moscow. The programme has expanded from 64 countries in 2017 to 211 countries and regions in 2018. Thirty-two international teams of Friendship were formed during the open draw, as well as playing roles for each young player from each country (goalkeeper, defender, midfielder or forward) were determined. These 32 teams will compete at the Football for Friendship World Championship on June 12 this year. As per the open draw, Bangladesh will play a “defender” in its international team of Friendship. The final events of the season will be held in Moscow, Russia from June 8-15 2018.

The government has selected Russian energy giant <mark>Gazprom</mark> and two other foreign oil companies for drilling 13 exploratory onshore gas wells in the country, even though state-owned exploration company Bapex has the capacity to implement the project.
The companies were selected under the Speedy Supply of Power and Energy (Special Provision) Act, 2010 after they submitted Expression of Interest (EoI) letters for the project, sources told the Dhaka Tribune.
The other two companies are Azerbaijan-based SOCAR AQS LLC and China-based Sinopec International Petroleum Service Corporation.
The project is expected to extract around 250 million cubic feet of gas every day within a year.
Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company Ltd (Bapex) has already finished negotiating with the companies and is set to sign the deals, said a Bapex official.
 This move has come to the dismay of Bapex officials who believe hiring foreign companies to do a job that Bapex can do itself will cost the government heavily.
“Bapex’s cost of exploring gas is less than most international oil companies. This decision will cost us financial loss,” said the Bapex official, requesting anonymity.
Bapex needs only Tk80 crore to drill a well, but it costs as much as Tk200 crore per well a foreign company does the job, he added.
Bapex currently has no plans to drill any wells despite owning five rigs, although high-ups at the company keep saying that they will have work in future, the Bapex official told the Dhaka Tribune.
“The reality is, after this project is implemented, there will be no work prospects for Bapex. Many Bapex officials are discontent about giving foreign companies well drilling projects, but the company management has hardly taken that into regard,” he said.
He claimed there are local agents of these foreign companies working in Bangladesh, some of whom are high officials in the Energy and Mineral Resources Division, which is why this decision was made.
However, Bapex Managing Director Md Nowshad Islam said exploration of some onshore gas wells was on the cards for the company, but did not give any specifics.
Badrul Imam, geology professor at Dhaka University and an energy expert, believes this project is too ambitious.
“Bangladesh has never drilled so many wells at a time before,” he told the Dhaka Tribune. “It is not clear why 13 wells were selected. Many of these wells do not have much prospect of gas, like Patharia West-1.”
He said Bapex should involve experienced consultants or geologists in the process of selecting exploratory wells for drilling.
Bapex, a Petrobangla subsidiary, has a record of success in gas exploration, which <mark>Gazprom</mark> does not in Bangladesh.
In a previous drilling job, which <mark>Gazprom</mark> received without having to go through the tender process, the company failed to extract the target amount of gas when it drilled 15 wells in 2012-16.
<mark>Gazprom</mark> is currently employed in another project to drill two onshore wells – Shahbazpur North and Shahbazpur East – at nearly double the cost of what Bapex would have spent, according to sources.
In the new project, <mark>Gazprom</mark> will drill five wells – Mubarakpur-2, Srikail North-1, Shrikail East-1, Sunetra-2 and Madan-1 – targeting a depth of 5,000-5,500 metres.
SOCAR, which will be working for the first time in Bangladesh if the deal is finalised, will drill four wells – Begumganj-4, Semutang South-1, Madarganj-1 and Shariatpur-1 – targeting a depth of 3,000-4,000 metres.
<EM>Sinopec </EM>will drill four wells – Hararganj-1, Batchia-1, Patharia West-1 and Dupitila-1 – targeting a depth of 3,500 metres.
Sinopec has worked in Bangladesh before. The Chinese company has successfully finished the drilling of four onshore gas wells in the state-owned Titas Gas Field – a project they won through a tender process.

Nord Stream 2, as the project is called, has provoked controversy in Europe – but the pipeline is planned to be in use as soon as 2019. Supporters of Nord Stream 2 make two bold claims: Ukraine is apparently an untrustworthy partner for gas transit, and Europe supposedly needs more Russian gas. Both arguments are questionable, and there are good reasons to put the project on ice.</P><P>First of all, transporting gas through Ukraine is not a major supply risk for Europe. It is almost impossible to imagine that today’s Ukraine would even consider interrupting the flow of gas to the EU. After all, Ukraine benefits greatly from the EU’s political and economic support. Kiev would not want to jeopardise that. Moreover, any break in gas transit would provoke the building of a pipeline avoiding Ukraine, and thereby actually endanger Ukraine’s own gas supply. This is because Ukraine gets a third of its gas supplies from the EU, in the form of reimports from Slovakia.</P><P>On the other hand, Ukraine would be sure to see the building of Nord Stream 2 as a clear sign of distrust from Europe. Indeed, Ukraine has redoubled its efforts to reform its gas sector, and the changes are already bearing fruit. The state-owned gas company needs much less public subsidy, and gas consumption is massively reduced. Western gas companies are setting up in the Ukrainian market, and there is justified hope that in some years Ukraine will be able to meet all its own gas needs from domestic production.</P><P>Without gas transit through Ukraine, EU countries would not really have enough gas to supply Ukraine from the west. These supplies consist overwhelmingly of gas that originally flowed into Slovakia through Ukraine. Therefore, bypassing Ukraine with Nord Stream 2 would force Kiev to return to buying gas directly from <mark>Gazprom</mark>. This dependant relationship would probably be more than just economic in nature. Is that really a situation that the EU wants to encourage?</P><P>The second main argument for Nord Stream 2 is that falling gas production in north-west Europe makes additional infrastructure for Russian imports necessary. But increasing needs can be met for at least the next decade using existing pipelines: in 2014 there was 100 billion m<SUP>3</SUP> of unused capacity from Russia. What’s more, renewable energies and improvements in energy efficiency offer hope that gas demand might actually fall. Even if the need for imports does suddenly shoot up, Europe is still in no danger of a gas supply crisis. Necessary extra gas can easily be imported from overseas at any time using the existing liquid gas terminals.</P><P>In fact, Nord Stream 2 could weaken Europe’s resolve to find alternatives to Russian gas. <mark>Gazprom</mark> would surely try to use the new pipeline at full capacity, and the constant stream of gas could be flexibly priced to react to any competition. This would make the development of other supplies and energy sources difficult over the coming decades.</P><P>Nord Stream 2 is of strategic importance for Russia and the EU, in terms of both energy and geopolitics. But the interests of the two partners do not neatly overlap. Building the pipeline too soon would leave Ukraine dependent on direct Russian gas exports, and hinder the search for alternative supplies in Europe. In any case, risks around transit or demand over the next 5-10 years seem to be manageable with the existing infrastructure.</P><P>So the best idea is simply to wait on making the decision. If it becomes clear that a route bypassing Ukraine is needed, or additional imports become necessary, the plan can always be taken back down from the shelf. But for the moment the project would do the EU more harm than good.</P><DIV class=""republishing""><H4>Republishing and referencing</H4><P>Bruegel considers itself a public good and takes no institutional standpoint.</P><P>Due to copyright agreements we ask that you kindly email request to republish opinions that have appeared in print to <A href=""mailto:communication@bruegel.org"">communication@bruegel.org</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></BODY></HTML>"

                    [post_content] =&gt; With European gas import demand having risen substantially since 2014, <mark>Gazprom</mark> has dramatically increased its sales on the European market. In Q1 2018, <mark>Gazprom</mark> reported record daily gas exports to Europe in late February and early March. This Comment addresses the question of how those volumes were delivered to the market, and the extent to which the infrastructure for delivery of those volumes was used,  highlighting that, in times of peak European gas import demand, full utilisation of the Nord Stream and Yamal-Europe pipelines left Ukraine as the only transit route with spare capacity. Until Nord Stream 2 and Turkish Stream are built, <mark>Gazprom</mark> will remain dependent on gas transit via Ukraine throughout the year, with Ukraine providing substantial flows in summer as European gas storage facilities are refilled, and a combination of significant flows and additional spare capacity in the winter peak demand period.

                    [post_content] =&gt; The arrival of the first Russian LNG supplies to the UK coincided with the deterioration of UK-Russia diplomatic relations, triggering debates over the role of Russia in UK hydro<mark>carbon</mark> imports. Although Russia is the largest supplier of UK coal imports, coal is being phased out of UK energy consumption. Russia is just one of several substantial suppliers of crude oil and refined oil products to the UK, with levels of UK oil demand being strongly linked to developments in the UK transportation fuel mix. By contrast, natural gas is the largest source of UK heat and power generation, and underpins non-transportation sector energy consumption. UK gas import demand is currently largely met by pipeline imports from Norway and LNG imports from Qatar. However, as the UK seeks to cope with fluctuations in domestic gas demand through increased LNG imports and gas trade with north-western Europe, following the closure of the UK’s only seasonal gas storage facility, the challenge to UK energy security is not dependence on Russian gas supplies but rather increasing exposure to international gas market volatility.

                    [post_content] =&gt; <mark>Gazprom</mark> has confounded many expectations by enjoying two record years of gas sales in Europe in 2016 and 2017. External factors have certainly played a role in its success, with overall European demand rebounding, indigenous production continuing to fall and alternative sources of imports failing to deliver at the expected levels (especially LNG). In addition, <mark>Gazprom</mark> has demonstrated  a level of flexibility in its pricing strategy that has kept its gas very competitive, with the result that its market share in Europe has grown to 35%. However, the anticipation that this figure could rise towards 40% and above has led EU politicians and policy-makers to become concerned about over-dependence on Russian gas, and many now wish to ensure that <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s future options are limited by obstructing potential new pipelines. In addition the politics surrounding Ukraine, the imposition of stricter US sanctions, questions surrounding  the DG COMP investigation into <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s activities and the Stockholm arbitration ruling over contracts with Ukraine add further layers of complexity. This paper therefore explores whether <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s two <EM>anni mirabiles</EM> in 2016 and 2017 can be repeated or whether Russian gas faces a more challenging environment in the rest of the decade.
                    [post_title] =&gt; <mark>Gazprom</mark> in Europe – two “Anni Mirabiles”, but can it continue?

            [post_content] =&gt; With European gas import demand having risen substantially since 2014, <mark>Gazprom</mark> has dramatically increased its sales on the European market. In Q1 2018, <mark>Gazprom</mark> reported record daily gas exports to Europe in late February and early March. This Comment addresses the question of how those volumes were delivered to the market, and the extent to which the infrastructure for delivery of those volumes was used,  highlighting that, in times of peak European gas import demand, full utilisation of the Nord Stream and Yamal-Europe pipelines left Ukraine as the only transit route with spare capacity. Until Nord Stream 2 and Turkish Stream are built, <mark>Gazprom</mark> will remain dependent on gas transit via Ukraine throughout the year, with Ukraine providing substantial flows in summer as European gas storage facilities are refilled, and a combination of significant flows and additional spare capacity in the winter peak demand period.

REUTERS/Hardi Baktiantoro/Files</P></SPAN></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></DIV></DIV><P>A year later, the project is close to collapse, a casualty of labyrinthine Indonesian bureaucracy, opaque laws and a secretive palm oil company.  </P><P>The Rimba Raya project, on the island of Borneo, is part of a United Nations-backed scheme designed to reward poorer nations that protect their <mark>carbon</mark>-rich jungles.  </P><P>Deep peat in some of Indonesia’s rainforests stores billions of tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> so preserving those forests is regarded as crucial in the fight against <mark>climate change</mark>.  </P><P>By putting a value on the <mark>carbon</mark>, the 90,000-hectare (225,000 acre) project would help prove that investors can turn a profit from the world’s jungles in ways that do not involve cutting them down.  </P><P>After three years of work, more than $2 million in development costs, and what seemed like the green light from Jakarta, the project is proof that saving the world’s tropical rainforests will be far more complicated than simply setting up a framework to allow market forces to function.  </P><P>A Reuters investigation into the case also shows the forestry ministry is highly skeptical about a market for forest <mark>carbon</mark> credits, placing it at odds with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who supports pay-and-preserve investments to fight <mark>climate change</mark>.  </P><P>Hong Kong-based Lemons, 47, a veteran of environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark>, and profitable, projects, discovered just how frustrating the ministry can be to projects such as his.  </P><P>“Success was literally two months around the corner,” he said. “We went through — if there are 12 steps, we went through the first 11 on time over a 2-year period. We had some glitches, but by and large we went through the rather lengthy and complicated process in the time expected.”</P><P>That’s when the forestry ministry decided to slash the project’s area in half, making it unviable, and handing a large chunk of forested deep peatland to a palm oil company for development.  </P><P>The case is a stark reminder to Norway’s government, the world’s top donor to projects to protect tropical forests, on just how tough it will be to preserve Indonesia’s rainforests under its $1 billion <mark>climate</mark> deal with Jakarta.  </P><H3>UNLIMITED CORRUPTION  </H3><P>The dispute has turned a spotlight on Indonesia’s forestry ministry, which earns $15 billion a year in land permit fees from investors. Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) said last month it will investigate the granting of forest permits and plans to crack down on corruption in the resources sector.  </P><P>“It’s a source of unlimited corruption,” said Chandra M. Hamzah, deputy chairman at the KPK.  </P><P>Indonesia Corruption Watch, a private watchdog, says illegal logging and violations in issuing forest use permits are rampant. It estimates ill-gotten gains total about 20 trillion rupiah ($2.3 billion) each year.  </P><P>A forest ministry official connected with the U.N.-backed forest <mark>carbon</mark> offset scheme was sentenced in April to three years in prison for accepting a $10,000 bribe to ensure an Indonesian company won a procurement tender.  </P><P>Wandojo Siswanto was one of the negotiators for Indonesia’s delegation at the 2009 U.N. <mark>climate</mark> talks in Copenhagen, despite being a bribery suspect. His case has highlighted concerns about the capacity of the forestry ministry to manage forest-<mark>carbon</mark> projects.  </P><P>The forestry sector has a long history of mismanagement and graft. Former trade and industry minister Bob Hasan, a timber czar during the Suharto years, was fined 50 billion rupiah ($7 million) for ordering the burning of forests in Sumatra and then imprisoned in a separate case of forestry fraud after Suharto was toppled from power in 1998.  </P><P>In an interview in Jakarta, senior forestry ministry officials denied any wrongdoing in the Rimba Raya case and criticized the project’s backers for a deal they made with Russia’s <mark>Gazprom</mark>, the world’s largest gas producer, to market the project’s <mark>carbon</mark> credits.  </P><P>Internal forestry ministry documents that Reuters obtained show how the ministry reversed its support for the project after a new minister came in, and a large chunk of the project’s land was turned over to a palm oil firm.  </P><P>The case illustrates how growing demand for land, bureaucratic hurdles and powerful vested interests are major obstacles to conservation projects in Indonesia and elsewhere in the developing world.  </P><P>That makes it hard for these projects to compete and navigate through multiple layers of government with the potential for interference and delay.  </P><P>“We have systematically not been able to demonstrate that we can complete the loop to turn projects into dollar investments,” said Andrew Wardell, program director, forests and governance, at the Center for International Forestry Research in Indonesia.  </P><P>“Which is why the palm oil industry is winning hands down every time.”</P><H3>SHOWCASE PROJECT  </H3><P>The Rimba Raya project was meant to save a large area of <mark>carbon</mark>-rich peat swamp forest in Central Kalimantan province and showcase Jakarta’s efforts to fight <mark>climate change</mark>.  </P><P>Much of the area is dense forest that lies atop oozy black peat flooded by tea-colored water. Dozens of threatened or endangered species such as orangutans, proboscis monkeys, otter civets and Borneo bay cats live in the area, which is adjacent to a national park.  </P><P>Rimba Raya was designed to be part of the U.N’s Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) program. The idea is simple: every tonne of <mark>carbon</mark> locked away in the peat and soaked up by the trees would earn a steady flow of <mark>carbon</mark> credits.  </P><P>Profit from the sale of those credits would go to project investors and partners, local communities and the Indonesian government. That would allow the project to pay its way and compete with palm oil farmers and loggers who might otherwise destroy it.  </P><P>Rich countries and big companies can buy the credits to offset their emissions.  </P><DIV class=""container_1tVQo"" tabindex=""-1""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption_KoNH1""><SPAN><P>Birute Mary Galdikas, the founder of Orangutan Foundation International (OFI), visits a feeding station at OFI's orangutan care and quarantine centre in Pangkalan Bun in the province of Central Kalimantan in this undated handout photo courtesy of InfiniteEARTH. REUTERS/InfiniteEARTH/Handout</P></SPAN></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></DIV><P>By preserving a large area of peat swamp forest, Rimba Raya was projected to cut <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by nearly 100 million tonnes over its 30-year life, which would translate into total saleable credits of about $500 million, <mark>Gazprom</mark> says.  </P><P>It would also be a sanctuary for orphaned or rehabilitated orangutans from elsewhere in Borneo. Rimba Raya teamed up with the founder of Orangutan Foundation International, Birute Mary Galdikas, in which OFI would receive a steady income from annual <mark>carbon</mark> credit sales.  </P><P>It was the sort of project President Yudhoyono and Norway have pledged to support. Yudhoyono has put forests — Indonesia is home to the world’s third-largest forest lands — at the center of a pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 26 percent by 2020.  </P><P>He tasked a senior adviser to press for reforms to make REDD projects easier and for greater transparency at the forestry ministry.  </P><H3>GOLD STANDARD  </H3><P>Rimba Raya was poised for success. It got backing from the Clinton Foundation’s <mark>Climate</mark> Initiative, which helped pay for some of the early costs. <mark>Gazprom</mark> invested more than $1 million.  </P><P>It was the first in the world to meet stringent REDD project rules under the Washington-based Voluntary <mark>Carbon</mark> Standard, an industry-respected body that issues <mark>carbon</mark> credits. Rimba Raya was also the first to earn a triple-gold rating under the <mark>Climate</mark>, Community and Biodiversity Alliance, a separate verifier.  </P><P>Companies including German insurer Allianz and Japanese telecoms giant NTT pledged to buy credits from the project if it gets its license.  </P><P>In December 2009, the forestry ministry tentatively named the now Indonesian-registered company PT Rimba Raya Conservation the license holder for nearly 90,000 ha, contingent on it passing an environmental impact assessment. It did so a few months later.  </P><P>The ownership of PT Rimba Raya Conservation is split 70 percent foreign and 30 percent Indonesian, with Lemons and business partner Jim Procanik holding small stakes.  </P><P>Lemons is CEO of Hong Kong-based firm InfiniteEARTH, which is the developer and manager of the Rimba Raya project as well as investment fund-raiser. Procanik, 44, is the managing director.  </P><P>In June last year, Forestry Minister Zulkifli Hasan asked for a map that would set the final boundary of the project, according to a copy of the instruction seen by Reuters. This mandatory step normally takes a few weeks. Once the map is issued, a project is eligible for a license to operate.  </P><P>But by September last year it was clear something was wrong, according to Lemons. Despite repeated promises by ministry officials, the final map had not been issued. No explanations were given.  </P><P>“No one has ever said, ‘No’. So that’s exhausting,” said Lemons.  </P><P>What followed instead was a series of steps by the forestry ministry that have resulted in the project being undermined.  </P><P>A ministry review focused on conflicting claims to the land by several companies belonging to palm oil firm, PT Best Group.  </P><P>PT Best, which is run by Indonesian brothers Winarto and Winarno Tjajadi, had long coveted the peat land within the area the forestry ministry set aside for the Rimba Raya project.  </P><P>On December 31, 2010, PT Best was granted 6,500 ha of peat swamp land for palm oil development, next to a smaller parcel of deep peat land granted a year earlier — part of PT Best’s broader plan to connect its palm oil plantations in the north with a port on the coast nearby. The land granted last December was part of the original area set aside for Rimba Raya.  </P><P>The Tjajadi brothers declined several requests by Reuters to comment.  </P><P>The December allocation to PT Best came despite assurances from Forestry Minister Hasan that he would not allow deep peatlands to be converted for agriculture.  </P><P>The allocation also came a day before a two-year moratorium on issuing licenses to clear primary forests and peat lands was due to start on January 1 this year. The moratorium is a key part of the <mark>climate</mark> deal with Norway.  </P><P>After months of delay, the forestry ministry finally ruled that PT Rimba Raya was only eligible for 46,000 ha, a decision that cut out much of the peatlands covering nearly half the original project area.  </P><H3>OMBUDSMAN INVESTIGATES  </H3><P>The case has now been brought before the office of the Indonesian government’s Ombudsman. In an interview, senior Ombudsman Dominikus Fernandes told Reuters he believed the forestry ministry should issue the license to Rimba Raya.  </P><P>“If Rimba Raya has already fulfilled the criteria, there should not be a delay in issuing the license,” he said.  </P><P>“This is a model project in Indonesia that should be prioritized. If we don’t give an example on the assurance of investing in Indonesia, that’s not a good thing.”</P><P>Officials from the forestry ministry, in a lengthy interview with Reuters, said the area was given legally for palm oil development because PT Best had claims to the land dating back to 2005.  </P><P>Secretary-General of the ministry Hadi Daryanto stressed the peatland areas originally granted to Rimba Raya were on a type of forest called convertible production forest, which can be used for agriculture but not REDD projects. Handing that nearly 40,000 ha to Rimba Raya would be against the law, he said.  </P><DIV class=""inline-container_1QqKC mega_19SOz""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption_2BUXy"">Slideshow<SPAN class=""count_3OPtf""> (7 Images)</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></DIV><P>Yet in 2009, the ministry was ordered to make the title switch for this same area of peatland so it could be used for a REDD project. The instruction to immediately make the switch, a bureaucratic formality, was never acted on.  </P><P>In the Oct 2009 decree seen by Reuters, former Forestry Minister H.M.S. Kaban issued the order as part of a broader instruction setting aside the nearly 90,000 ha for ecosystem restoration projects. Kaban left office soon after.  </P><P>Indonesian law also bans any clearing of peat lands more than 3 meters deep. An assessment of the Rimba Raya area by a peat expert hired by InfiniteEARTH showed the peat is 3 to 7 meters deep, so in theory was out of bounds for PT Best to clear for agriculture.  </P><P>For Lemons, 47, the mood has switched from exhilaration to bitter disappointment. “We’ve been here every day pushing like hell from every angle,” he said.  </P><P>Procanik says the disappointment is personal. “Todd and I have both invested what savings we had for our kids’ college education in this project,” he said.  </P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> is also upset.  </P><P>In a letter dated June 16 to the Indonesian government, the Russian firm criticized the ministry’s failure to issue the license for Rimba Raya and threatened to abandon clean-energy projects in Indonesia estimated to be worth more than $100 million in foreign investment. The government has yet to respond.  </P><H3><mark>CARBON</mark> DREAMS?  </H3><P>Secretary-General Daryanto and Iman Santoso, Director-General for forestry business management, said another major problem was InfiniteEARTH’s deal with <mark>Gazprom</mark>, which was made in the absence of any license.  </P><P>“We didn’t know about the contract with <mark>Gazprom</mark>. They had no legal right to make the contract,” Daryanto told Reuters.  </P><P>Santoso described it as the project’s “fatal mistake.”</P><P>Daryanto also questioned whether REDD would ever work and whether there was any global appetite for <mark>carbon</mark> credits the program generates, a view at odds with other parts of the Indonesian government, which has been actively supporting REDD projects.  </P><P>“Who will pay for the dream of Rimba Raya? Who will pay? Nobody, sir!” Daryanto told Reuters during an interview in the heavily forested ministry compound near central Jakarta.  </P><P>Lemons said the <mark>Gazprom</mark> deal was explained in person during a presentation of a 300-page technical proposal submitted to the ministry to prove the project would be financially viable. Daryanto was among a ministry panel that approved the proposal.  </P><P>“One of their biggest concerns was whether REDD could deliver the same revenues to the state as other land-use permits such as palm oil, logging, mining. We were required to show contracts that demonstrated we could pay the fees and annual royalties,” he said.  </P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>, designated as the sole marketer of <mark>carbon</mark> credits from Rimba Raya, said it had already agreed long-term sales contracts with buyers at between 7 and 8 euros ($10 to $11.40) per tonne — contingent on the license being issued.  </P><P>“We’ve sold to four or five companies around that price,” said Dan Barry, <mark>Gazprom</mark> Marketing &amp; Trading’s London-based global director of clean energy.  </P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> became involved, he said, because it was a project that looked to have official support. The Russian company agreed to a financing mechanism that ensured the project’s viability for 30 years, regardless of the price level of <mark>carbon</mark> markets.  </P><P>Those markets, centered on the European and U.N. <mark>carbon</mark> trading programs, were valued at $142 billion in 2010, the World Bank says. National <mark>carbon</mark> trading schemes are planned for Australia and South Korea, while California is planning a state-based scheme from 2013. New Zealand’s <mark>carbon</mark> market started in 2008.  </P><P>“If you ever want a successful REDD scheme, you are going to have to have a process that people believe in,” Barry said.  </P><P>“The Ministry of Forestry ought to be doing everything it can to support a program that benefits forestry as opposed to favor a program that’s there to cut it down and turn it into palm oil.”</P><H3>“AHEAD OF ITS TIME”</H3><P>Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, the head of the REDD task force in Indonesia who is also in charge of the president’s government reforms unit, said the Rimba Raya case highlighted deep flaws in the bureaucracy and the need for sweeping reforms to underpin the 40 other REDD projects in Indonesia.  </P><P>“The core concern is the trust in government statements of readiness, and responsibility,” he told Reuters in an email. “Even with the best of intentions, the unsynchronous action of the central government’s ministry and the district government’s action is not conducive for investment, especially in this new kind of venture.  </P><P>“I can surmise that the case of Rimba Raya is a case of a business idea that is ahead of its time. The government infrastructure is insufficiently ready for it.”</P><P>Legal action was one solution to this case, he added.  </P><P>That is a path Lemons and Procanik may eventually take but for now they have proposed a land swap deal with PT Best in which the firm gives PT Rimba Raya 9,000 ha of peat land in return for a similar sized piece of non-peat land held by PT Rimba Raya in the north of the project near other PT Best landholdings.  </P><P>PT Best rejected an earlier offer by Rimba Raya of 9 percent of the credits from the project, Lemons said.  </P><P>Based on recent satellite images, PT Best has yet to develop the disputed 9,000 ha area.  </P><P>The delays mean it is too late for Rimba Raya to become the world’s first project to issue REDD credits. That accolade has since gone to a Kenyan project.  </P><P>“Our whole point here is to show host countries that REDD can pay its way,” said Lemons. “And if it can’t pay its way then we haven’t proven anything.”</P><P>In a sign a resolution could still be possible, Ombudsman Fernandes, Forestry Minister Hasan and PT Rimba Raya are scheduled to meet on Aug 19.  </P><DIV class=""container_28wm1""><DIV class=""attribution_o4ojT""><P class=""content_27_rw"">Additional reporting by Olive Rondonuwu and Yayat Supriatna in Jakarta and Harry Suhartono in Singapore; Editing by Simon Webb, Simon Robinson and Bill Tarrant</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

              <DIV class=""miscTitle""><mark>Carbon</mark> Briefing: Russian energy giant <mark>Gazprom</mark> seeks to re-establish itself with new gas pipeline</DIV></DIV><P>Is the Russian energy giant <mark>Gazprom</mark> reeling or rising? On the same day last week, the Guardian reported <A href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7806870.stm""><mark>Gazprom</mark> was “reeling</A>” in the wake of the US gas revolution, while the Financial Times said that  <A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cab278c8-2f38-11e2-b8c5-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2CNbQKu8Y""> <mark>Gazprom</mark> has cemented its “hegemonic role</A>” as Europe’s biggest gas provider because of a deal over a new pipeline.</P><P>So has <mark>Gazprom</mark> lost influence because of the boom in the gas market in the US, or does this new pipeline secure <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s future as a major player in the global energy market? Or is it a bit of both?</P><P><STRONG>The South Stream pipeline</STRONG></P><P>The planned new gas pipeline – called South Stream – will run from Russia, under the Black Sea and then divide into two parts in Bulgaria. One part will go through Serbia and Hungary, ending in Austria, the other will go through Greece and end in Italy (the blue line in the image below).</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> has just obtained the green light after Bulgaria – the last country to hold out against the plan – agreed on the condition that <mark>Gazprom</mark> gives it a reduced price for gas from 2013. </P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> decided the route of the pipeline on largely political grounds, and for two main reasons.</P><P>First, it increases Russia’s influence over Ukraine by providing an alternative route for gas provision to Western Europe. About a fifth of the supply of gas from Russia to the rest of the EU currently goes through Ukraine. This has created tension between the two countries, with <mark>Gazprom</mark> <A href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7806870.stm"">shutting off its supply of gas to Ukraine</A> in 2009 for three weeks over a row about <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s prices and Ukraine’s unpaid bills. This in turn led to a drop in the supply of gas <A href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7808937.stm"">to other EU countries</A>.</P><P>Eventually, <A href=""http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/01/21/uk-russia-ukraine-gas-idUKTRE5091KI20090121?sp=true""> Russia agreed to turn the gas supply back on</A>– Ukraine agreed not to raise the price it charges Russia to allow it to keep transporting gas through the pipeline, and Ukraine got a reduced gas price in 2009. The controversy harmed consumer confidence in the relationship between Russia and Ukraine, and gave <mark>Gazprom</mark> a further incentive to look for alternative routes to transport its gas to the rest of Europe.</P><P>Secondly, the South Stream pipeline secures <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s prominent position as a key energy provider in the European gas market in the face of increasingly strong opposition. With the US set to overtake Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world’s largest oil producer by 2035 <A href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7806870.stm"">because of advances in the extraction of shale gas</A>, both <mark>Gazprom</mark> and the Russian government see this as important.</P><P>A flood of US shale gas could reduce both <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s ability to command high prices in the European market and Russia’s ability to negotiate favourable terms in the European political arena based on its status as the principal energy provider. So the South Stream pipeline marks a political win for <mark>Gazprom</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>The problem with gas</STRONG></P><P>But while the South Stream pipeline may help to entrench <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s influence in the European energy markets, securing the route is not without risks.</P><P>The <A href=""http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/05/uk-europe-coal-iea-idUKBRE8940U620121005""> International Energy Agency</A> reports that coal is likely to displace gas as Europe’s primary source of energy through to 2017, but the South Stream pipeline isn’t set to become operational until 2015. Add to that the availability of cheaper US gas, and <mark>Gazprom</mark> is unlikely to enjoy the hold it previously had on the European energy market – at least not at the prices it’s used to charging.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> also has its own problems. <A href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/nov/15/<mark>gazprom</mark>-chill-shale-gas-revolution""> As the Guardian reports</A>, the company is now playing catch-up to the US, where gas technology and infrastructure for gas is far more developed, leaving the Russian incumbent rushing to replace its ageing network of leaky pipelines and dated extraction equipment.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>’s status was further reduced when it shelved plans for a flagship gas pipeline intended to foray into the <A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ab331568-f1d8-11e1-bba3-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2CNbQKu8Y""> Arctic region</A> because of the technical difficulties in exploring the region and losing the US as chief potential importer because of its own domestic provision.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> has also been forced to admit that its prices have been consistently <A href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-11-08/europes-price-vengeance-on-<mark>gazprom</mark>""> too high</A>–<A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/55c1aeb0-07c6-11e2-9df2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2CNbQKu8Y""> twice as high</A> as the price of gas in the US in September. This is because <mark>Gazprom</mark> links its gas prices to those of oil, rather than competing with the cheaper prices available for natural gas originally intended for the US.</P><P>The European Commission is also <A href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19482312"">investigating <mark>Gazprom</mark></A> for abusing its position as the dominant gas provider in Europe. The EU claims <mark>Gazprom</mark> is restricting the flow of gas to countries that do not cooperate with it (such as Ukraine), is blocking a diversification of the energy supply, and setting the price of gas at unfair levels.</P><P><STRONG><mark>Gazprom</mark>, rising and falling</STRONG></P><P>While the South Stream pipeline has political benefits for <mark>Gazprom</mark> and the Russian government, the company is still on rocky ground: the long-term prospects of gas as part of Europe’s energy mix is uncertain and the European Commission’s investigation could still spell bad news for <mark>Gazprom</mark> itself. So while the South Stream pipeline strengthens <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s position politically, the economic future looks more uncertain. </P></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the issue during Kern's visit to an economic forum in St Petersburg this month, Der Standard said, citing insiders, Reuters reported.
OMV and <mark>Gazprom</mark> had signed an outline deal in the Russian city to coordinate &quot;the development of the gas transmission infrastructure required for providing natural gas supplies to central and southeastern Europe&quot;.
A source familiar with the plans told Reuters it was too early to talk about project costs and investments. If realized, the project would likely boost the importance of OMV's Baumgarten gas hub, which distributes around 57 billion cubic meters a year.
Der Standard said the project would be an extension of the TurkStream pipeline, which <mark>Gazprom</mark> plans to finish by the end of 2019. The extended line could pump Russian gas to Italy, which currently receives supplies from Baumgarten via the TAG and SOL pipelines.
Alternatively, Russian gas could go from western Turkey via Greece to Italy.
Spokesmen for OMV and Kern declined to comment. <mark>Gazprom</mark> had no immediate comment.
Russia scrapped the South Stream pipeline project, which would have supplied Russian gas to southern Europe with an undersea pipeline to Bulgaria, in late 2014 because of objections from the European Union on competition grounds.
The dispute between Brussels and Moscow followed Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and the imposition of western economic sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine conflict.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article-tags""><DIV class=""label"">Topics</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

the wake of the recent signing of the US-China deal on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, Russia
is once again seen as a global outlier. Given Moscow’s lack of interest in
leading the <mark>climate</mark> battle, statements depicting Russia as the loser in this
development appear exaggerated.</P><P>Yet,
in the midst of excitement about the Obama-Xi <mark>climate</mark> accord, it is easy to
forget that 10 years ago Russia surprised the international community by
joining the Kyoto Protocol – a binding multilateral <mark>climate</mark> treaty that committed rich nations (at the time excluding
China and India, two of the largest greenhouse gas
polluters) to a moderate five percent average
reduction in emissions relative to 1990. The Kyoto Protocol is still the world’s only internationally binding
agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On that
occasion, it was <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s new-found interest in the prestige of becoming
a ‘great ecological power’ (<EM>velikaya ekologicheskaya derzhava</EM>) that enticed Russia to endorse
the deal.</P><H2><STRONG>A great ecological power</STRONG></H2><P>But
why exactly did Russia join the Kyoto Protocol in 2004?  Many
observers speculated on this question: Russia has never championed
environmental protection on a global scale. During the lengthy pre-ratification
period, most Russian scientists remained ambivalent about the effects of global
warming. Meanwhile, Russia’s metallurgic sector has traditionally been among
the most energy intensive in the world. Until recently, the practice of flaring
natural gas was not seen as a worrisome practice. </P><P><EM class=""mag-quote-right"">Russia has never championed

the early 2000s, both opponents and  supporters of the Kyoto Protocol tended to
view the commitment through the lens of the Russian economy and the country’s
national priorities. Ahead of the deal, two contrasting forces prevailed. </P><P>Russia
faced enormous challenges in terms of reviving its economy. It therefore
supported the argument advanced by other big emitters and transition economies
like China, Brazil, and India. These countries argued that they still hoped to
achieve the kind of economic development the West had been enjoying for
decades. Thus, they were unwilling to support any <mark>climate</mark> deal that would
hamper the attainment of that goal. </P><P>In
contrast, Russia did not want to lose the opportunity to add to its reputation
as a rising power on the world stage. Torn between the ‘developing country’ and
the ‘great power’ narrative, Russia’s ratification went through a long domestic
struggle before the final decision was made. Considering this domestic
bargaining and the country’s traditional low regard for environmental issues,
unpacking the incentives behind Russia’s ratification of the Kyoto protocol
becomes all the more interesting.</P><P><SPAN class=""wysiwyg_imageupload image imgupl_floating_none 0""><SPAN class=""image_meta""><SPAN class=""image_title"">The Kyoto Protocol logotype. Image: Marco Parilla via Wikipedia. Some Rights Reserved</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P>Initially,
many business groups opposed the treaty on the grounds that it would hamper the
growth of Russia’s economy. Certain academics even questioned the scientific
foundations of the Kyoto Protocol altogether. On the other side of the spectrum,
an eminent scientist, Nikolai Klyuev, from the Geographical Institute at the
Russian Academy of Sciences, introduced the idea of Russia as a ‘great ecological
power’. </P><P>In
line with Russia’s self-identification as a Great Power, and President Putin’s
strengthened national-patriotic ideology, the country welcomed the opportunity
to boost its image as a great ecological nation. </P><H2><STRONG>Putin’s hesitation </STRONG></H2><P>However,
in 2002, following the disappointment over the US withdrawal, Putin’s hesitance
became protracted. For Putin, the question of ratification had always been
political rather than environmental. In other words, the decision was guided by
the ‘relative gains’, which Kyoto could provide. </P><P>Subsequent
to the US rejection of the treaty, Russia’s economic interests in the Kyoto
Protocol decreased substantially, as it was left without a major buyer for its
emissions surplus. Moreover, some observers pointed out that if even a
rich country like the US was worried about the treaty’s economic impact, a
country such as Russia could ill afford it. Putin’s economic policy adviser,
Andrei Illarionov, was the most vocal among the critics. </P><P>Yet,
comparing Russia and the United States was misleading – the two countries were
in diametrically opposed positions. If the US had moved to ratify, the US would
have been obliged to take action to cut emissions, while Russia would actually
have gained through ratification due to sales of its surplus allowances.</P><P>Be
that as it may, after the US withdrawal, the EU undertook to save the protocol
by successfully rounding up enough signatories for the protocol to enter into
force in February 2005. Crucial to this was the EU’s diplomatic effort with
Russia. With the US’s refusal to join the treaty, only Russia carried the
weight to carry the treaty across the 55 % hurdle, that is, the combined percentage of
the industrialised world’s greenhouse gas emissions. By 2003, the industrialised
states that had ratified the Kyoto Protocol represented 44 % of these
emissions. Russia, if it also ratified the protocol, would add a further (critical)
17 % to this figure. </P><H2><STRONG>Political leverage</STRONG></H2><P>The
decisive role of Russia in the enforcement of global <mark>climate policy</mark> gave it
political leverage. In fact, to secure Russia’s participation, the country was
given more sink allowances, which effectively relaxed the emissions constraints
previously negotiated in Kyoto. The huge amount of <mark>pollution</mark> credits that Russia
won under the Kyoto’s emission trading system was the decisive concession, which
made Russia respond to the EU’s campaign of persuasion. </P><P>Many
observers speculated that Russia’s ratification of the protocol was a <EM>quid
pro quo</EM> for the EU’s support for its application to join the World
Trade Organisation (WTO). Besides the economic incentives, other contributing
factors included the political opportunity to boost Russia’s status while
leaving the Bush administration increasingly isolated internationally on
<mark>climate change</mark> issues. While these incentives could have played a role, they
pale in comparison to the key incentive: economic gains offered in <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s
favour. <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s support came from the realisation of the enormous profits it
could gain from selling unused emission credits, and investing these revenues
in clean technologies for the ‘greening’ of Russia’s economy.</P><P>Though
WTO accession loomed in the background, the decision to join Kyoto had much
more to do with the direct economic benefits Russia could extract from the
treaty than with considerations regarding WTO membership. <mark>Climate policy</mark> experts
estimated that Russia  benefited from the
protocol by roughly 10 billion dollars annually through emission trading, joint
investment projects, and increased foreign investments. The protocol set a zero
reduction target for Russia, meaning that Russian emissions could not exceed
the level of 1990 between 2008 and 2012, the first commitment period of the
agreement.</P><P class=""pullquote-right""><mark>Climate policy</mark> experts estimated that Russia benefited from the protocol by roughly 10 billion dollars annually.</P><P>Indeed,
Russia could actually increase emissions, or sell its excess emission
allowances to other states within the protocol without violating the agreement.
In 2003, the otherwise sceptical Russian corporate sector began to express
interest in the ‘capitalisation’ of climatic benefits. Alongside other energy
companies, <mark>Gazprom</mark> adopted this line of argument. Not by chance, by mid-2004,the
single most insistent lobbyist in favour of the agreement was <mark>Gazprom</mark>.</P><H2><STRONG><mark>Gazprom</mark> gains</STRONG></H2><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>
gained from Kyoto for a number of reasons. Firstly, the company saw the so-called Joint Implementation (JI)
projects as a cheap way of rehabilitating the company through foreign
investments. In 2006, one of <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s first pilot energy-savings projects was
implemented in cooperation with the German company Ruhrgas AG for the optimisation
of gas pipelines and the reduction of fuel gas waste.</P><P><SPAN class=""wysiwyg_imageupload image imgupl_floating_none caption-xlarge""><SPAN class=""image_meta""><SPAN class=""image_title"">A gas flame burns at a gas refinery. Imagine by: Kokhanchikov via Shutterstock (c)</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P>Secondly,
the industry knew that it could make profits from <mark>carbon</mark> trading due to
Russia's generous emissions targets, especially with the help of improvements
in energy efficiency from JI investment. Since Russia’s energy sector is
notoriously <mark>carbon</mark> intensive, it had vast potential for energy-saving
improvements. </P><P>Thirdly,
<mark>Gazprom</mark> looked forward to an increase in sales of natural gas that, as an environmentally-friendly fuel, would be in high demand from other European Kyoto signatories. An
EU study estimated that the initialisation of the EU Emissions Trading System
alone could boost European demand for natural gas by as much as 6% in the
period 2008–2012, since fuel switching is one of the cheaper short-term options
for industrial enterprises to meet their <mark>CO2</mark> emission caps. As
witnessed by the EU’s present day de-<mark>carbon</mark>isation policy, the centre-piece of
which is natural gas, these expectations have proven correct. </P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>
also had reputational incentives to support the <mark>climate</mark> regime: on its website,
<mark>Gazprom</mark> listed a range of energy-saving measures, including the optimisation of
transmission system gas flow, the replacement of gas compressor units, and the
implementation of automated control systems, all of which had the goal of
simultaneously improving its image and attracting foreign investment.</P><P>Although
technically controlled by the state, <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s influence inside the Presidential
Administration has always been considerable. In fact, one of the priorities of
the government is to assure the outside world that <mark>Gazprom</mark> conducts its
business effectively, a necessity given the extraordinary amount of rents it
provides for the state. </P><P>Among
the insiders, Dmitry Medvedev (at the time Chairman of <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s Board of Directors)
was also Vladimir Putin’s Chief of Staff, and thus a particularly influential
figure. Russia’s flirtation with Kyoto may have been the consequence of
Medvedev’s policy priorities, which in turn were closely related to <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s
economic incentives.</P><H2><STRONG>Political fanfare </STRONG></H2><P>As
soon as Medvedev became president in 2008, he signed a decree increasing energy
efficiency. Yet, the main instrument for achieving this goal of reduced energy
usage in the economy would be the gradual increase of regulated domestic prices
on gas, a scheme that, once again, suited the interests of <mark>Gazprom</mark> far more
than it promoted energy-saving technologies.</P><P class=""pullquote-right"">As with many other Medvedev initiatives, the action plan remained on the level of political fanfare.</P><P>Moreover,
in May 2009, Russia officially adopted a <mark>Climate</mark> Doctrine, which committed the
country to eradicating the sources of <mark>climate change</mark> in its ‘own way’.
Initially, it was hoped that Medvedev’s energy-efficiency plan would offer real
potential for reducing greenhouse gases. Yet, as with many other Medvedev
initiatives, the action plan remained on the level of political fanfare rather
than a practical policy document. At the time of writing, the <mark>Climate</mark> Doctrine
has no legal standing and has not provided any concrete measures to mitigate
<mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>In
sum, Russia expected its <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by 2008 to decrease by 20% from 1990 levels.  In 2010, the country’s <mark>carbon</mark> emissions stood at 34.2 % below
their 1990 level – a notable track record. However, these reductions had not
been the outcome of focused policies to cut emissions. The decrease in
emissions was principally due to the economic decline that followed Russia’s
transition to a market economy after the collapse of the Soviet system. The
economic downturn shuttered factories, shrunk agriculture, and the re-growth of
forests sequestered more <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>But
the same card cannot be played in perpetuity. After Russia joined  the WTO in 2012, there were no further
incentives that would keep it on board. In fact, as of 2011, Russia gave notice
it would not enter into the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.
Moscow’s preference, shared by Japan and Canada, is for a new global agreement
that obliges all major emitters to participate, meaning that today the Kyoto
protocol covers no more than 16% of global emissions. </P><H2><STRONG>Agency and redemption </STRONG></H2><P>The success of the US-China
declaration on <mark>climate</mark>, raises hopes for the upcoming Paris <mark>climate</mark> talks, but
it also demonstrates two important points. Firstly, the Chinese Communist Party
has staked its legitimacy and political survival on raising the environmental
standards of average Chinese. Secondly, Obama is taking great pains to restore
his fortunes and reinvigorate his presidency; and <mark>climate policy</mark> is one aspect.</P><P>Most recently, at the UN’s latest round of
<mark>climate</mark> talks in Lima, Russia surprised many observers by strongly supporting
the draft for a new global deal, to be signed
in Paris, in a year. Putting rhetoric to one side, Russia has continued
with negotiations as is usual by choosing to remain isolated, and letting the US, China,
and India take the lion’s share of the blame for the current lack of progress. </P><P class=""pullquote-right"">Russia has shown very little
agency in the <mark>climate</mark> battle  </P><P>But now, with
China finally ready to work on <mark>climate change</mark>, India has become the
single-biggest wild card ahead of the Paris talks in December 2015. At present,
India has adopted an intransigent position on further
emission reductions. But if <mark>climate</mark> negotiators want a truly global agreement,
they will have to bring India on board. </P><P>In this constellation, there
is some room for Russian redemption. A decade after talking about becoming
a ‘great ecological power’, the country has shown very little agency in the
<mark>climate</mark> battle and has left the international <mark>climate</mark> community generally
unimpressed. However,
if Russia’s declared plan to cut emissions is genuine, the country could restore its international
standing by attracting followers in the BRICS, especially by enticing India,
which Putin has been courting since the escalation of geopolitical
tensions with the West. Undoubtedly,
Putin’s new-found relationship with Narendra Modi is strongly related to
Russia’s power struggle over Ukraine.<SPAN> </SPAN></P><P>

Despite this underlying geopolitical motivation, if cosy relations between Russia and
India result in a change of New Delhi’s stance on <mark>climate change</mark>, Moscow will regain
some legitimacy in the <mark>climate</mark> battle, and perhaps find that it has given the world
some hope in this fractious period of renewed tension.</P><P><EM>Standfirst Image: <mark>Gazprom</mark> offices in Russia.

They found it acutely embarrassing. When <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/24/greenpeace-activists-arctic-oil-russia"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">I went to the Arctic Ocean last year to take action against <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s Prirazlomnaya drilling rig</A>, I got a decidedly less friendly reaction, but there were no arrests and certainly no talk of years in prison.</P><P>My protest was hardly the stuff of legend, it's true. I had managed, somehow, to climb up the side of the platform, and was hanging about eight metres above the freezing Arctic Ocean. Fifteen hours later, when my hard hat was finally broken by the water cannon the rig workers were blasting at us, I decided it was probably time to climb down.</P><P>This August, the same <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greenpeace"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Greenpeace</A> ship went back to the same waters, to repeat the same protest at the same rig. <mark>Gazprom</mark> knew exactly what to expect and so, we thought, did we.</P><P>And then the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) turned up. The guns and knives came out. A cannon was fired, but this time it was not water but bursts of ammunition across the bow of our ship. <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/19/greenpeace-protesters-arrested-arctic"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">FSB commandos abseiled onto the deck and seized the vessel</A>, and all 30 on board were held at gunpoint and taken to Murmansk. Since then they spent two months in prison, some of them in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, before being released on bail. They have been charged with hooliganism, which carries a potential sentence of seven years.</P><P>The story of my broken hard hat doesn't impress people quite so much as it used to.</P><P>So what happened in the 12 months that passed between these identical protests? What prompted such a different response?</P><P>The profit margins on offshore oil extraction in the Arctic have always been slim, and it's certainly arguable that recent developments onshore, most notably the discovery of the Bazhenov shale deposits, have made <mark>Gazprom</mark> and Shell's expensive joint venture even less economically viable than it already was. If that's the case, then Greenpeace drawing attention to its weaknesses (like the lack of any plan to clean up an oil spill) stops being a mere annoyance and becomes a serious threat.</P><P>Yet by over-reacting and demanding the FSB take action, <mark>Gazprom</mark> attracted a lot more publicity than the hanging of a banner could ever have achieved.</P><P>I think the Prirazlomnaya and <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s machinations to keep it afloat need to be understood in a global context, where an unlikely and somewhat uncomfortable coalition is forming between investors, environmentalists, scientists, intelligence agencies and an increasingly radicalised public all calling for governments to intervene on <mark>climate change</mark>. If we – and they – succeed, then <mark>Gazprom</mark> and its partner Shell <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/19/<mark>carbon</mark>-bubble-financial-crash-crisis"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">will see billions wiped from their balance sheets</A>.</P><P>Here's the problem. Recently the <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/27/ipcc-world-dangerous-<mark>climate</mark>-change"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> warned</A> that we can emit a further half a trillion tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and still stay below 2C of global warming by the turn of this century. Two degrees may sound trifling, but the global impacts are enormous. It means we lose all of the Arctic sea ice and several low-lying nations, and recent extreme weather will look mild by comparison.</P><P>So we have a <mark>carbon</mark> budget of around 500 gigatonnes (GT), yet burning the fossil fuel that corporations now have in their reserves would produce 2,795GT of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide — five times the so-called safe amount. So four-fifths of known fossil fuel reserves and all of the undiscovered resources, including everything in the Arctic, need to remain where they are, underground, unburnt. Worthless. <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Oil</A> companies' market valuations are based on &quot;assets&quot; whose value has been wiped out by a cruel twist of atmospheric physics. The inevitable market correction won't be pretty, which explains how the oil companies persuaded their vassal governments to ignore the end of the oil age and keep setting fire to our future.</P><P>For a stark reminder of what we'll have to get used to if these companies get their way, you need only look to the Philippines. More than 5,000 people lost their lives because of typhoon Haiyan, and hundreds of thousands were left displaced, without food, water or shelter. We know <mark>climate change</mark> will bring even more extreme weather events. Three years earlier, <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Russia</A> lost 50,000 people to a heatwave similar to the one that killed 50,000 in Europe in 2003. Extreme weather will become more and more common if irresponsible governments and fossil fuel companies cannot put their self-interest aside and call time on our addiction to fossil fuels.</P><P>This concern isn't confined to idealistic hippies. The International Monetary Fund is asking for an end to fossil fuel subsidies. The World Bank is saying that our aspirations to put an end to global poverty in the context of runaway <mark>climate change</mark> will become futile. Intelligence agencies are warning governments that the biggest threat to global peace and security is <mark>climate change</mark>, and PricewaterhouseCoopers is warning of stranded fossil fuel investments.</P><P>Not only are fossil fuel companies holding a busted flush, but alternative energy sources are encroaching on their territory. Photovoltaic panels have dropped in price by over 99% since the 70s, and by around 80% in the last five years. In India, solar is cheaper than diesel. Wind power is following a similar, if slightly less dramatic, decline in cost. The gas industry in Brazil has asked the government to institute protectionist measures to limit their exposure to competition from wind – a competition they have begun to lose. In Australia, the world's biggest coal exporter, all forms of renewable electricity are cheaper than fossil fuels, even coal. But the current prices are less important than the direction of travel. Renewables are dropping in price, while fossil fuels are rising.</P><P>All of which explains why companies like <mark>Gazprom</mark> are so determined to silence their critics. Their only solution is to obfuscate, to muddy the waters and delay the inevitable, all with the connivance of their pocket politicians. Our governments have become the man in the joke who, when confronted by a highwayman with the usual demand of &quot;your money or your life&quot;, asks for time to think about it.</P><P>Which brings us back to peaceful protests on oil rigs in the freezing Arctic Ocean - the only rational response to years of deliberate inaction. In the days after typhoon Haiyan, the Filipino <mark>climate</mark> commissioner <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/11/typhoon-haiyan-philippines-<mark>climate</mark>-talks"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">told the assembled delegates at the latest round of UN <mark>climate</mark> talks in Warsaw</A>:</P><P>&quot;I feel that I should rally behind the <mark>climate</mark> advocates who peacefully confront those historically responsible for the current state of our <mark>climate</mark>. These selfless people who fight coal, expose themselves to freezing temperatures, or block oil pipelines. In fact, we are seeing increasing frustration and, thus, more increased civil disobedience. The next two weeks, these people, and many around the world who serve as our conscience will again remind us of our enormous responsibility.&quot;</P><P>And we will keep doing exactly that. We will battle to make our voices heard over the oil industry and their pliant politicians as efforts are made to drown us out, to shut us up, perhaps with a court order, perhaps in a jail cell. Not because they're evil, but because their fortune is at stake. And it's hard to lose a trillion dollars gracefully.</P><DIV class=""submeta""><SPAN class=""submeta__label"">Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

	Amsterdam, 22 November 2013 - Just five oil companies — Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and ConocoPhilips — are ultimately responsible for emissions equivalent to nearly 12.5 % of cumulative historical global industrial emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and methane, startling new research has shown [1].
</DIV></DIV><DIV><P>This  new report exposes the companies that have made major contributions to  the <mark>climate</mark> crisis — and the investors that fund them — and for the  first time calculates their contribution to global industrial emissions  of greenhouse gases and potentially identifying their measure of  culpability for <mark>climate change</mark> impacts.</P><P>The  report comes as several leading civil society organizations walked out  of the UN <mark>climate</mark> talks in Warsaw, Poland to protest the lack of  progress in the negotiations and the failure of several governments to  stand up to the fossil fuel industry.  A major impediment to progress in  the <mark>climate</mark> negotiations has been the failure of rich countries to  provide financing to compensate vulnerable countries for damages caused  by the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;Fossil  fuel companies plan to exploit untapped oil and coal reserves while our  <mark>climate</mark> can't handle the amount of <mark>carbon</mark> that has already been  emitted. These companies must be held accountable for the damages they  have caused, and their plans to send us past a point of no return must  be stopped,&quot; said Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace  International. &quot;Until governments finally act, we will have no choice  but to continue to intervene to prevent a <mark>climate</mark> catastrophe, acting as  the Arctic 30 did against the most powerful industry on earth.&quot;</P><P>The peer-reviewed research published in Climatic Change  on historic <mark>carbon</mark> emissions shows that the estimated emissions of 90  entities are equivalent to approximately 63 % of cumulative global  emissions of industrial <mark>CO2</mark> and methane (calculated as <mark>CO2</mark>  equivalents) between 1854 and 2010 [2].</P><P>The  90 entities are made up of 50 investor-owned companies, 31 state-owned  enterprises and nine former and current states [3]. Cumulatively,  emissions estimated for investor-owned companies amount to 315 Gt <mark>CO2</mark> e  (21.7%), for state-owned enterprises to 288 Gt <mark>CO2</mark>e  (19.8%) and for  former and current states to 312 Gt <mark>CO2</mark>e (21.5%). Of these emissions  estimated for <mark>carbon</mark> producers, half has been emitted since 1986.</P><P>The largest 10 investor-owned companies contributed an estimated 229.5 Gt of <mark>CO2</mark>e,  equivalent to 15.8 % of the estimated cumulative historical global  emissions through 2010. The 21 U.S. based companies included in this  study alone contributed an estimated 172.6 Gt <mark>CO2</mark>e (12%) of global  emissions through 2010. In 2010, investor-owned companies contributed  7,628 Mt<mark>CO2</mark>e or 242 t<mark>CO2</mark>e per second (equivalent to 27.3%) to the atmosphere.</P><P>The results are, that the estimated emissions of those 90 entities amount to 914 Gt <mark>CO2</mark>e of cumulative world emissions of industrial <mark>CO2</mark>  and methane. The entities are comprised of 83 of the world’s largest  fossil fuel entities (crude oil &amp; NGLs, natural gas, and coal) plus  cement manufacture´s emissions by 7 entities. The threshold for entities  to be included in this study was set at the production of ≥8 million  tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> (MtC) in a recent year. Some entities have since been  added, while others were absorbed through mergers or acquisitions.</P><P>&quot;These  findings provide a ground breaking development and a new building block  in terms of potential legal outcomes to hold fossil fuel producers  liable for damage caused by <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; said Stephen Leonard, a  lawyer and the President of the <mark>Climate</mark> Justice Programme.</P><P>The industry ranking was published after 28 Greenpeace International  activists and two freelance journalists were detained at gunpoint by  Russian security forces who seized their ship the Arctic Sunrise on September 19  after a peaceful protest at a <mark>Gazprom</mark> Arctic oil drilling platform.  Taking action to demand <mark>climate</mark> protection, these 30 brave men and women  have since spent the past two months in detention, charged with a crime  they did not commit.</P><P>St.  Petersburg courts have now granted bail to 26 members of the so-called  Arctic 30, 15 of whom have been released. But Australian activist Colin  Russell has had his bail request denied and the Arctic 30 still face at  least one serious charge that could see them spend years in a Russian  prison.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>,  and its partner Shell, the two companies that are leading the charge to  drill for oil in the pristine Arctic, ranked high on the list in the  study. <mark>Gazprom</mark> ranks 5th in the top 20 investor and state-owned  entities, while Shell is ranked at number six.</P><P>&quot;This  evidence should be further impetus for people all over the world to  follow in the footsteps of the Arctic 30 by standing up to these  companies. While those brave people could spend several years in a  Russian jail, the real culprits — companies like <mark>Gazprom</mark> and Shell — are  free to keep polluting the planet. They’re the ones who should be held  accountable and forced to stop, not the peaceful protestors who stand up  to them on behalf of all of us,&quot; said Ben Ayliffe, head of the Arctic  oil campaign for Greenpeace International.</P><P>For more information, please contact:</P><P>Swati Jangle, Communications Manager Greenpeace International</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

By <U><A href=""https://mlexmarketinsight.com/expertise/contributors/matthew-newman"">Matthew Newman</A></U>.</H4><P>The EU hasn't been shy in unleashing its tough antitrust laws against even the most powerful and well connected of companies — including Russia's natural gas giant <mark>Gazprom</mark>. But when it comes to government-to-government agreements, the EU watchdog says its hands are tied.</P><P>That's the message coming from today's two-pronged announcement from Margrethe Vestager. The EU's antitrust chief reminded journalists that while she has been able to demand and obtain concessions from <mark>Gazprom</mark> on its supply of natural gas, she just doesn't have the power to deal with certain government deals.</P><P>Today, Vestager was obliged to admit that Russia's agreement with Poland had led her to drop objections to <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s control over a crucial pipeline crossing the country. &quot;As regards the Yamal pipeline, the situation cannot be changed by antitrust procedure,&quot; she conceded.</P><P>Yet when it comes to the state-backed <mark>Gazprom</mark>, there is a fine line between state and non-state actors — and the European Commission knows this well.</P><P>Since the EU regulator began its investigation of <mark>Gazprom</mark> in 2012, company officials have argued that the bloc has no jurisdiction to apply European antitrust law because the gas giant is under the Russian government's control.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> argued that its conduct in Eastern Europe is governed by agreements between Russia and various Eastern European governments. As a result, <mark>Gazprom</mark> has been acting under the direct responsibility of Russia. Under EU rules, antitrust rules don't apply to governments.</P><P>The commission has steadfastly rejected these arguments — and the regulator's seven-week &quot;market test&quot; asking rivals and customers to respond to <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s commitments to change contracts and free gas flows suggests it is having some success.</P><P>But when it comes to gas deals underpinned by solid, state-to-state arrangements, Vestager has had to throw in the towel. And in the case of the Yamal pipeline, that's a galling realization, given that the Danish antitrust chief has real concerns.</P><H4>Market test</H4><P>The commission's market test, announced today, follows <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s offer to change contracts to allow customers to sell Russian gas crossing their borders to a third countries. For example, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia may want to sell their Russian gas to a Baltic country or Bulgaria.</P><P>The commission has been investigating these contract restrictions, believing they artificially carve up markets along national boundaries.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>'s concessions on this issue suggest the commission has made progress.</P><P>In a statement today, the company's deputy chairman, Alexander Medvedev, said <mark>Gazprom</mark> hopes &quot;the commission — and ultimately the markets — will respond positively to our proposal, which should allow moving the procedure forward and closing the case in the near future.&quot;</P><P>But the commission has also raised concerns that the Russian gas supplier used its market muscle as a gas supplier to control access to gas infrastructure. And this has proven problematic.</P><P>In particular, the regulator probed <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s supply agreements with Poland's state-controlled oil and gas company PGNiG that included an obligation for <mark>Gazprom</mark> to maintain control over the Yamal pipeline.</P><P>Yamal carries gas 4,196 kilometers from the vast gas fields of Western Siberia through Belarus and Poland, to customers in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.</P><P>In its official charge sheet — Statement of Objections — the commission found that control over the Yamal pipeline was governed by an agreement between Poland and Russia. This agreement mandated <mark>Gazprom</mark> to keep control over the pipeline.</P><P>And that's where the commission's competition enforcement came unstuck.</P><H4>Compelled by the state</H4><P>In the Yamal case, <mark>Gazprom</mark> was able to argue that it was acting under &quot;state compulsion&quot; and wasn't responsible for its behavior. Under EU rules, antitrust law can't be applied when companies' decisions are dictated by agreements between governments.</P><P>State-owned companies often invoke this argument. For example, in the commission's probe of illegal agreements between airlines to fix fees for transporting cargo, some state-owned companies argued in 2008 that antitrust rules couldn't apply because national laws required them to arrange prices with competitors.</P><P>In the <mark>Gazprom</mark> case, EU officials argue that the Polish-Russian agreement applies to only a &quot;narrow&quot; aspect of its case. The commission has successfully asserted its jurisdiction over other aspects of <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s behavior and obliged it to remove control over its infrastructure, they insist.</P><P>Yet today's remarks by Vestager are an admission that, on Yamal, the commission was obliged to concede defeat.</P><P>This and other attempts of the &quot;state compulsion&quot; argument are prompting the EU watchdog to go back to the drawing board with legislation to avoid similar stumbling blocks in the future.</P><P>Under a proposed law, all intergovernmental agreements will be subject to prior scrutiny by the commission. The draft bill was passed by European Parliament earlier this month and now must be approved by EU governments.</P><P>Vestager said today that the proposed legislation &quot;shows that effective competition in Central and Eastern European gas markets of course cannot be achieved by the enforcement of EU competition rules alone.&quot;</P><P>It was a frank acknowledgement on the part of the commission that EU antitrust law can only go so far. In its current form, the legislation can tackle contractual barriers and complaints that <mark>Gazprom</mark> charged excessive prices. But with government agreements, some hurdles still trip up antitrust enforcers.</P><P>That's why the commission needs to scrutinize intergovernmental deals, so companies can't argue that &quot;the state made me do it&quot; and get away with abusing their market dominance.</P><SECTION class=""share-links""><DIV class=""title"">Share this </DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

                    [post_content] =&gt; With European gas import demand having risen substantially since 2014, <mark>Gazprom</mark> has dramatically increased its sales on the European market. In Q1 2018, <mark>Gazprom</mark> reported record daily gas exports to Europe in late February and early March. This Comment addresses the question of how those volumes were delivered to the market, and the extent to which the infrastructure for delivery of those volumes was used,  highlighting that, in times of peak European gas import demand, full utilisation of the Nord Stream and Yamal-Europe pipelines left Ukraine as the only transit route with spare capacity. Until Nord Stream 2 and Turkish Stream are built, <mark>Gazprom</mark> will remain dependent on gas transit via Ukraine throughout the year, with Ukraine providing substantial flows in summer as European gas storage facilities are refilled, and a combination of significant flows and additional spare capacity in the winter peak demand period.

                    [post_content] =&gt; The arrival of the first Russian LNG supplies to the UK coincided with the deterioration of UK-Russia diplomatic relations, triggering debates over the role of Russia in UK hydro<mark>carbon</mark> imports. Although Russia is the largest supplier of UK coal imports, coal is being phased out of UK energy consumption. Russia is just one of several substantial suppliers of crude oil and refined oil products to the UK, with levels of UK oil demand being strongly linked to developments in the UK transportation fuel mix. By contrast, natural gas is the largest source of UK heat and power generation, and underpins non-transportation sector energy consumption. UK gas import demand is currently largely met by pipeline imports from Norway and LNG imports from Qatar. However, as the UK seeks to cope with fluctuations in domestic gas demand through increased LNG imports and gas trade with north-western Europe, following the closure of the UK’s only seasonal gas storage facility, the challenge to UK energy security is not dependence on Russian gas supplies but rather increasing exposure to international gas market volatility.

                    [post_content] =&gt; <mark>Gazprom</mark> has confounded many expectations by enjoying two record years of gas sales in Europe in 2016 and 2017. External factors have certainly played a role in its success, with overall European demand rebounding, indigenous production continuing to fall and alternative sources of imports failing to deliver at the expected levels (especially LNG). In addition, <mark>Gazprom</mark> has demonstrated  a level of flexibility in its pricing strategy that has kept its gas very competitive, with the result that its market share in Europe has grown to 35%. However, the anticipation that this figure could rise towards 40% and above has led EU politicians and policy-makers to become concerned about over-dependence on Russian gas, and many now wish to ensure that <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s future options are limited by obstructing potential new pipelines. In addition the politics surrounding Ukraine, the imposition of stricter US sanctions, questions surrounding  the DG COMP investigation into <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s activities and the Stockholm arbitration ruling over contracts with Ukraine add further layers of complexity. This paper therefore explores whether <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s two <EM>anni mirabiles</EM> in 2016 and 2017 can be repeated or whether Russian gas faces a more challenging environment in the rest of the decade.
                    [post_title] =&gt; <mark>Gazprom</mark> in Europe – two “Anni Mirabiles”, but can it continue?

It will only become effective in 2019 and is consistent with the company’s earlier announcements and long-term plans.</I><I> Nevertheless, Mikulska adds, there is reason for the EU to scrutinize <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s actions closely.</I></P><P>On March 2nd, <mark>Gazprom</mark> announced that it would <A href=""https://twitter.com/<mark>Gazprom</mark>EN/status/969581106231201794"">“immediately commence the procedure of terminating its gas supply and transit contracts with Naftogaz…”</A> The move has been a direct response to the February 28th ruling by the Stockholm Arbitral Tribunal that requires <mark>Gazprom</mark> to pay over $2.5 billion for the losses that Ukraine experienced due to disadvantageous conditions of the 2009 gas contract. But while the decision may seem abrupt and unpredictable to some observers, it has been consistent with the Company’s goals and longer-term strategy.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG><EM>The move is consistent with <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s long established goal to avoid Ukraine as a transit country as their contract expires in 2019</EM></STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>To begin, <mark>Gazprom</mark> displays many of the trappings of a commercial entity, but in practice, frequently functions as an <A href=""https://www.bakerinstitute.org/media/files/files/ac785Ga2b/BI-Brief-071817-CES_Russia1.pdf"">extension of the Russian state</A>. With ongoing presidential campaign that is focused on highlighting Russian power, it is difficult to imagine that <mark>Gazprom</mark> would quietly agree with an arbitration decision that could be seen as weakness not only on the part of company but also of Russia.</P><H3>Not so immediate</H3><P>Also, despite the threatening tone, <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s announcement suggests a less immediate time schedule and a more strategic approach, as the Company “immediately <U>commences the procedure</U> of terminating” rather than “terminates immediately” any contractual obligations that relate to supply and transit of gas via Ukraine.</P><P>As such, the move is consistent with <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s long established goal to avoid Ukraine as a transit country as their contract expires in 2019. Meanwhile, the “procedure” that is supposed to follow <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s announcement may not even conclude until 2019. In addition, <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s long-term contractual obligations with third countries, many of which expire well into 2020s, will need to be renegotiated to change their destination points from Ukraine-based flanges to hubs.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG><EM>Due to considerable push from its European long-term contract partners, <mark>Gazprom</mark> was forced to renegotiate many of its long-term agreements</EM></STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Those re-negotiations will also take time and, until they commence, at least some Russian gas is likely to flow via Ukrainian pipelines.</P><P>Interestingly, this relatively near-term (though not immediate) ability of <mark>Gazprom</mark> to abandon Ukraine as a transit territory hinges upon combination of EU market and policy factors.</P><H3>Changing market conditions</H3><P>First, global abundance of natural gas and increasing competition galvanized European gas buyers and led a number of them to pursue legal action to <A href=""https://www.oxfordenergy.org/publications/the-political-and-commercial-dynamics-of-russias-gas-export-strategy/"">renegotiate long-term gas supply deals with <mark>Gazprom</mark> to obtain more favorable pricing and terms of engagement</A>. This includes greater volumetric flexibility under <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s take-or-pay (ToP) agreements. In essence, a take-or-pay clause requires a supplier to provide a certain level of contracted gas or pay the price of the undelivered volumes. Customers are in turn obligated to accept those volumes or pay the price of the refused gas.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG><EM><mark>Gazprom</mark> is careful to maintain its reputation as a reliable supplier, particularly to Western Europe</EM></STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>In recent years, due to considerable push from its European long-term contract partners, <mark>Gazprom</mark> was forced to renegotiate such clauses in many of its long-term agreements with minimum delivery requirements lowered significantly—in some cases, from 85% down to only 70% of the formally contracted volume.</P><P>The reduction in commitments was hardly <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s desired course of action, although it leaves some firm revenue on the table. However, since <mark>Gazprom</mark> is not committed to deliver to the contracted point of delivery as much gas as before, it also potentially facilitates the company’s strategy to avoid Ukrainian transit, especially when combined with the <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-<mark>gazprom</mark>-europe-gas-court/eu-court-rejects-polish-bid-to-halt-opal-pipeline-deal-verdict-in-2019-idUSKBN1A625Z"">recent decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union</A> (CJEU) to allow <mark>Gazprom</mark> to use up to the maximum capacity of the Opal pipeline (until a final ruling is announced in 2019).</P><P>The Opal pipeline is an extension that allows distribution of gas imported through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that brings Russian gas directly to Germany and can provide a way for delivery of Russian gas that bypasses Ukraine.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG><EM>While market is certainly an important factor it does not entirely determine <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s behavior and company’s prevalent commitment to the interest of the Russian state</EM></STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>As calculated by <A href=""https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Russian-Gas-Transit-Across-Ukraine-Post-2019-NG-105.pdf"">Simon Piraniand and Katja Yafimova</A> of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, in absence of new pipelines (which is currently the case), 70% ToP levels coupled with <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s ability to use up to 100% of capacity of Opal pipeline provide <U>necessary and sufficient conditions</U> to ensure all but 6.6 bcm of <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s minimum necessary gas supplies to Europe can be delivered through routes that do not cross Ukrainian territory (at 2014 exports levels).</P><P>At the same time, <mark>Gazprom</mark> is careful to maintain its reputation as a reliable supplier, particularly to Western Europe.

But while market is certainly an important factor it does not entirely determine <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s behavior and company’s prevalent commitment to the interest of the Russian state.</P><H3>Minimizing negative impact</H3><P>Against this backdrop, European policy makers need to devise a policy that minimizes the potentially negative impact of <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s actions that serve political objectives or are a manifestation of power.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG><EM>The EU should be wary of agreements that can limit options for natural gas delivery across the region</EM></STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Specifically, the EU should be wary of agreements that can limit options for natural gas delivery across the region.

They have been under armed guard since last Thursday when the Russian authorities forced their way onto our ship and <A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/freeouractivists"" target=""_blank"">took the crew and activists captive</A>.</P><P>They did so following a peaceful direct action the day before against an oil platform, Prirazlomnaya, that belongs to the Russian energy giant <mark>Gazprom</mark>.</P><P>You may be wondering why the team on the Arctic Sunrise were prepared to take direct action to stop <mark>Gazprom</mark>? Well here is the answer:</P><P><STRONG>1. Prirazlomnaya is the first platform to start oil production in the ice covered Arctic</STRONG></P><P>Energy giant <mark>Gazprom</mark> is Russia's biggest company, accounting for 10% of the country's GDP, and it is set to play a key role in President Vladimir Putin’s plan to consolidate Russia's position as a global energy leader. Arctic oil drilling is central to that strategy and <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s oil platform Prirazlomnaya will be the first ever to begin commercial drilling operations in ice infested waters above the Arctic Circle. <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s giant $4bn Prirazlomnaya platform could supply oil directly to the global market by early 2014, becoming the first offshore rig to start pumping oil from underneath the ice covered waters of the Arctic.</P><P><STRONG>2. The Prirazlomnaya is not safe</STRONG></P><P>The Prirazlomnaya has been constructed using pieces of decommissioned North Sea rigs and has sat rusting in a Murmansk shipyard for years. It is not exactly a state-of-the-art oil driller and given that it will operate year-round in the remote Pechora Sea, where ice is present for nearly two-thirds of the year and temperatures can drop as low as -50°C, it is no exaggeration to say that the Prirazlomnaja is simply not safe.</P><P>This video is an edit of some material workers from Prirazlomnaya have put on Youtube. <A href=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/IpUfVYjXOyw"" target=""_blank"">It's a scary watch.</A></P><P> </P><P><STRONG>3. <mark>Gazprom</mark> will not make their oil spill response plan public</STRONG></P><P>The Arctic Council, of which Russia is a member, has agreed that oil spill response plans must be made public. Reading the company's full oil spill response plan is the only way society can assess the precise risks of a damaging spill. Despite that, <mark>Gazprom</mark> has only made a short summary of the <A href=""http://www.shelf-neft.<mark>gazprom</mark>.ru/en/?type=larn"" target=""_blank"">Prirazlomnaya's oil spill response plan publicly available</A>, whilst the full version can only be viewed in the company's offices under very strict restrictions. However, even the summary plan makes clear that <mark>Gazprom</mark> would be completely unable to deal with an accident in the far north. The company claims it <A href=""http://eng.<mark>gazprom</mark>questions.ru/index.php?id=17"" target=""_blank"">&quot;pays great attention to preventive environmental protection measures&quot;</A> but according to the official plans its <A href=""http://www.shelf-neft.<mark>gazprom</mark>.ru/images/materials/Prirazlomnoye.pdf"" target=""_blank"">worst-case scenario</A> is only for an oil spill of around 10,000 tons (about 73,000 barrels). The Deepwater Horizon disaster spewed <A href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wpdyn/content/article/2010/08/02/AR2010080204695.html"" target=""_blank"">nearly 5 million barrels into the Gulf of Mexico</A>, whilst the Prirazlomnaya itself can store <A href=""http://barentsobserver.com/en/topics/satellite-communication-installed-prirazlomnaya"" target=""_blank"">up to 650,000 barrels of oil.</A></P><P><STRONG>4. Oil spills are inevitable</STRONG></P><P>Statistically, <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oil_spills"" target=""_blank"">oil spills happen frequently</A>. In the Arctic the risk of a spill is even higher. Icy waters, icebergs and the extreme weather make the drilling conditions much worse and much more risky. Everyone in the industry and related authorities know this. Only last month the US and Canadian coast guards orchestrated the <A href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/09/130913-arctic-oil-spill-cleanup-technology/"" target=""_blank"">very first joint offshore oil spill response test</A> in the Northwest passage that - like the North East passage Russia controls - until a few years back was protected by the ice. So they staged a cleanup response trial last month, and let's just say it didn't go so smoothly. &quot;A Coast Guard skimming system was successfully deployed from a Canadian vessel participating in the drill, but bad weather also prevented deployment of a large ship emergency towing system provided by the state of Alaska,&quot; Coast Guard spokesman Kip Wadlow told the <A href=""http://www.alaskajournal.com/Alaska-Journal-of-Commerce/July-Issue-4-2013/US-Canada-conduct-Bering-Strait-spill-drill/"" target=""_blank"">Alaska Journal of Commerce</A>.</P><P><STRONG>5. It would be close to impossible to clean up an Arctic oil spill </STRONG></P><P>The near-impossibility of cleaning up an Arctic oil spill is well-documented. The Pew Environment Group recently <A href=""http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Protecting_ocean_life/PEW-1010_ARTIC_Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">examined oil spill response plans for operations in the Arctic</A> and warned that the oil industry is <A href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/nov/11/arctic-oil-spill-plans"" target=""_blank"">&quot;not prepared for the Arctic, the spill plans are thoroughly inadequate&quot;</A> adding that Arctic spill plans <A href=""http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Protecting_ocean_life/PEW-1010_ARTIC_Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">&quot;underestimate the probability and consequence of catastrophic blowouts&quot;</A>. Analysis for WWF found that industry proposals for assessing the risks of a spill in the Arctic were inaccurate, describing it as <A href=""http://worldwildlife.org/press-releases/shell-oil-unable-to-assure-safety-of-arctic-drilling-proposal-is-imagineering-not-engineering-says-former-shell-official"" target=""_blank"">&quot;Imagineering, not engineering&quot;</A>.</P><P>Oil recovery is near impossible in ice as standard spill technologies like booms become useless in thick ice. And even without ice in the waters, the extreme weather conditions make oil spill response very difficult. The US and Canadian coast guard authorities <A href=""http://www.alaskajournal.com/Alaska-Journal-of-Commerce/July-Issue-4-2013/US-Canada-conduct-Bering-Strait-spill-drill/"" target=""_blank"">learned this the hard way</A> when they experimented last month and were only capable of deploying a skimming system, but not the crucial large ship emergency towing system. In 2011, Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Robert Papp told Congress that his agency was <A href=""http://www.platts.com/latest-news/oil/Washington/US-not-ready-to-respond-to-Arctic-oil-spills-6320097"" target=""_blank"">totally unprepared for a BP-type spill in the Arctic</A>. &quot;If this were to happen off the North Slope of Alaska, we'd have nothing,&quot; Papp said. &quot;We're starting from ground zero today.&quot; Having followed the area intensely for the last couple of years, I would say that they are still at ground zero.</P><P>It isn't just the ice and the extreme weather conditionsthat would make it impossible to clean up a spill, but also the remote location.For a spill at Prirazlomnayja, much of the response equipment will be housed 1000km away in Murmansk, which means the company would not be able to mount a serious accident response for days.</P><P><STRONG>6. Prirazlomnaya is right next to wildlife reserves</STRONG></P><P>The Prirazlomnoye oil field is surrounded by national parks and wildlife sanctuaries like Nenetsky and Vaygach that are home to protected and endangered species such as the Atlantic walrus. <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s summary oil spill response plan suggests that walrus and bird habitats would likely be impacted from leaking oil were an accident to occur on the Prirazlomnaya, whilst Indigenous Peoples who rely on the Pechora Sea for fishing and hunting would also be affected.</P><P><STRONG>7. Russia's track record of oil spills is appalling</STRONG></P><P>Whole regions in Russia are <A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/campaigns/<mark>climate</mark>-change/arctic-impacts/The-dangers-of-Arctic-oil/Black-ice--Russian-oil-spill-disaster/ "" target=""_blank"">so polluted by oil spills</A> that everyday life for the residents in these places have already been changed dramatically. It is estimated that 5 million tons of oil leak from cracked wellheads, pipes and equipment throughout Russia each year. According to official data, over 500,000 tons of leaking oil seeps into the Arctic Ocean from the polluted rivers of northern Russia. Basically, Russia spills every two months the same amount of oil that the Deepwater Horizon lost at its blow-out in the Gulf of Mexico.</P><P><STRONG>8. Oil must be left in the ground if we are to slash the <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> that’s causing <mark>climate change</mark></STRONG></P><P>The majority of the world's proven coal, oil and gas reserves must be left in the ground, if the world is to avoid <mark>climate change</mark> at levels which would render parts of the planet uninhabitable. To be more specific, analysis by the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggests that more than 60% of currently proven reserves of oil should stay in the ground in order to stay within 2 degrees Celsius of warming. This means that extracting oil, including the oil found in the Arctic - which is both expensive and largely unproven - is extremely unlikely to be compatible with global action to limit dangerous <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>9. The Arctic region is fragile</STRONG></P><P>The sea ice coverage in the Arctic is 30 per cent below the level of 1979 and at the same time, it has become significantly thinner, adding up to a total of 75 per cent of the volume of summer sea ice has already disappeared. These <mark>climate change</mark> impacts have put the Arctic eco systems under immense pressure.</P><P>The Arctic is a unique and fragile environment, with a number of sea mammasl and other species living only - or almost only - in the Arctic. For example, polar bears, narwhals and walrus. The Arctic needs protection so it can cope with these changes caused by <mark>climate change</mark> and not to be put under the added pressure of oil production and oil spills.</P><P><STRONG>10. When states and companies fail, people take over</STRONG></P><P>When neither companies nor politicians live up to their responsibility to the society, people have to stand up and be brave. We need to stand together and oppose this sort of wrong doing. It is our democratic responsibility to challenge world leaders when they are so wrong. More than <A href=""http://www.savethearctic.org/"" target=""_blank"">4 million people have joined the Save the Arctic movement</A> and when Sini Saarela and Marco Weber climbed on the Prirazlomnaja to try and stop this environmental crime they did so with the support of millions of people around the planet. Together we oppose to the threat to wildlife, nature and <mark>climate</mark> that oil drilling in the Arctic involves. It's our duty to stand up against the oil industry, however powerful.</P></DIV></DIV></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class=""bloggerbyline""><DIV class=""bylinecontent hasprofileimage""><STRONG class=""bylinetitle"">Blog post by: <A href=""/archive-international/en/news/Blogs/Ben-Ayliffe/"">Ben Ayliffe</A></STRONG><DIV class=""bylinetext""><P>A keen ornithologist who has worked on many Greenpeace issues, Ben is head of the Arctic oil campaign.

At the end of winter natural gas storage facilities tend to be depleted, so Europe started importing natural gas massively from the only supplier with spare capacity and an ability to respond on a short notice. That supplier is of course <mark>Gazprom</mark> (<A href=""https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OGZPY"" title=""PJSC <mark>Gazprom</mark> ADR"">OTCPK:OGZPY</A>). On March 1st it set a new one day <A href=""https://www.rt.com/newsline/420323-<mark>gazprom</mark>-record-gas-europe/"" rel=""nofollow"">record</A> in gas deliveries to non CIS countries in Europe of 710 million cubic meters. It was the ninth day of new <SPAN>all-time record deliveries in a row. Clearly, <mark>Gazprom</mark> came to the aid of Europe in a time of need. It is now set to do so again given another week of unusually cold weather for this time of year. I do believe that the benefits that <mark>Gazprom</mark> is set to reap from the weather Europe experienced and continues to experience this month will extend into the whole year and beyond.</SPAN></P><H3 class=""p p1"">2018 is likely to be another record year for <mark>Gazprom</mark> exports.</H3><P class=""p p1"">As I pointed out in my previous article regarding the first late February, to early March deep freeze that Europe experienced, late February tends to be the time when spring weather arrives for most inhabitants of the continent, aside from perhaps the Scandinavian countries. Instead, they got a roughly ten day period of what most Europeans consider to be severe winter conditions. So, while ordinarily this time of year it might already be the start of the period when natural gas storage facilities might start to get filled or at least stop declining, instead it will be a period of further draw-downs.</P><P class=""p p2"">Source: <A href=""https://www.icis.com/resources/news/2018/03/01/10197992/low-european-gas-stocks-set-to-lift-prompt-and-summer-prices-in-march/"" rel=""nofollow"">ICIS</A>.</P><P class=""p p2"">As we can see, the month of March typically sees a more or less complete cessation of natural gas draw downs. While this year, it is set to keep going, possibly reaching actual full depletion by the end of the month, even as Gazrprom is continuing to pump gas at rates that are higher than usual. I should point out that even the 2017 level of gas in storage was considered to be rather low by historical standards, therefore we can expect demand for natural gas to remain strong throughout the year, given the seemingly depleted reserves in storage. Based on what we know so far, it seems that this year may be another year of record <mark>Gazprom</mark> sales to Europe, which would make it the third year in a row at this point.</P><P class=""p p2"">I should also note the fact that given the significantly higher price of oil which in the Old World tends to affect the price of longer term pipeline gas contracts that are tied to the price of oil, <mark>Gazprom</mark> is likely to not only see higher export volumes but also higher natural gas prices.</P><P class=""p p2"">Data source: <A href=""http://mosenergo.<mark>gazprom</mark>.com/investors/information-for-investors-and-analysts/reports/financial-statements/"" rel=""nofollow""><mark>Gazprom</mark>.</A></P><P class=""p p2"">As we can see, following the 2014 shock to the system that <mark>Gazprom</mark> received, just like most other oil &amp; gas producers, it managed to recover a great deal of its profitability rather nicely. I should mention that the devalued Russian Ruble played a significant role in this, because <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s exports are valued in Dollars or Euros. But such is the advantage of a country having its own currency, which it can adjust to its needs, or the market will adjust it, as was the case with Russia.</P><H3 class=""p p3"">Beyond 2018.</H3><P class=""p p3"">As I already pointed out in my first article on this subject, when the late February winter weather hit Europe, the odds of current <mark>Gazprom</mark> pipeline projects to Europe being obstructed seemed very low already. Surely European leaders have come to realize that continuing to depend on Ukraine as a transit country for the only source of natural gas that can be relied upon to be delivered on short notice may not be a wise choice. We should keep in mind that natural gas flows through Ukraine were disrupted on two occasions, both times in winter, due to a Ukraine-Russian pricing &amp; payments dispute. Every time Russia decided to stop delivering gas to Ukraine due to the disputes, Ukraine decided to remove the gas from the pipeline unilaterally, causing Russia to shut down the pipeline.</P><P class=""p p3"">The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which at this point seems to be a done deal was still on occasion targeted for obstruction attempted by some factions in the EU. Given the bad news in regards to Netherlands natural gas production which half a decade ago made up about half of all EU domestic supply is in free-fall, at least a portion of that 55 Bcm/year of extra natural gas capacity that the new pipeline will bring, will go to making up for the loss of Netherlands production. The rest will go to increased demand, which I see happening once Germany decommissions more nuclear power plants, as well as perhaps reducing reliance on Ukraine as a transit country to some extent. I doubt that Ukraine will cease to be a transit country for Russian gas any time soon, but a much-reduced role now seems inevitable. It will just gradually lose its strategic importance in this respect.</P><P class=""p p3"">Turk Stream will further reduce reliance on Ukraine as a transit country. It still remains to be seen what role it will play in supplying natural gas to the EU, but its role in supplying Turkey is set, meaning that pretty much all natural gas exports to Turkey will now flow directly to its shores. At present Turkey still receives some gas via Ukraine, but it already has the blue stream pipeline, which supplies Turkey with 16 Bcm/year. At the very least, it will be feeling more secure in knowing that its gas supplies will never depend on whether Ukraine &amp; Russia can get along or not.</P><P class=""p p4"">Same cannot be said about other countries, especially in Central Europe. <A href=""http://www.portfolio.hu/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">Hungary</A> is set to run out of natural gas in storage within days, with on-going <mark>Gazprom</mark> supplies being the only lifeline thereafter. But at the moment all of <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s gas supply to central Europe flows through Ukraine. In effect, Hungary and many other countries in the region will be literally praying for no friction between Ukraine &amp; Russia for the next few weeks. If a repeat of the 2006 or 2009 crisis were to happen right now, it would be a disaster, given the lack of reserves in storage. For this reason, I believe that many of these countries will lobby hard for the EU to refrain from obstructing a connection to the Turkstream project, which would give them an alternative route to Ukraine. Many of these countries would have had this extra level of energy security if the EU would have not obstructed the South Stream project and I have no doubt that they are thinking of that right now. I don't believe that the EU will want to be blamed in the future for member states running out of gas at any point in time, because it selectively blocked pipeline projects. There is already enough acrimony at this point on a range of other issues.</P><P class=""p p4"">Aside from the new pipelines to Europe, there is of course the pipeline to China, the new LNG facilities, as well as a range of other projects and project opportunities that seem to suggest <mark>Gazprom</mark> has a bright future ahead. In the end, it is sitting on massive reserves of a fuel that is set to be in very high demand as the world tries to do its best to at the very least stem the growth in coal use in order to try to fight <mark>climate change</mark>, as well as a range of local environmental issues associated with burning coal. In this respect, in my view there was never any reasonable doubt in regards to <mark>Gazprom</mark> looking at a bright future. What has been occasionally questioned, perhaps for good reason is the shorter to medium term outlook, as <mark>Gazprom</mark> seemed poised to become a victim of geopolitical events. Even before this month, it was starting to look more and more like it is not the case. For the month of March of this year, weather patterns came together to unmask the true reality of Europe's natural gas supply security. As storage facilities run empty <mark>Gazprom</mark> is not only cashing in this year, as the only supplier which has the ability to respond on short notice, but is set to cement its status as the indispensable supplier of gas for the old continent.</P><P id=""a-disclosure"" class=""p p5""><B>Disclosure:</B><SPAN>I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.</SPAN></P><P class=""p p5"">I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

      </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has warned that markets need to be prepared for the risks posed by <mark>climate change</mark> to avoid the fate of Germany’s utility companies.</P><P>He said extreme weather, unusable oil and gas reserves and desertification are all very real threats that financial markets do not always take into account. The implication here is that shares in insurers, natural resource companies and banks, which are directly exposed to these risks may not be correctly priced. But there was also a real danger that companies also did not react to government policies that were meant to address <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Mr. Carney pointed out that German energy giants had failed to read government policy on <mark>climate change</mark> correctly and were caught out by the country’s decision to switch away from fossil fuels and nuclear energy towards renewables. Its two once-mighty companies, E.ON and RWE, both lost value after government policy rendered their business model unviable.</P><P>“You do not want another German utility situation where people ignore the change in policy until all value is destroyed,” he said.</P><P>The Financial Stability Board, an international body chaired by Mr. Carney that monitors and makes recommendations on the strength of the global financial system, set up a taskforce on this subject. On Thursday, it outlined proposals to better understand the financial risk of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“The transparency will help investors understand how <mark>climate change</mark> affects the performance of a company,” Mr. Carney said in an interview with Handelsblatt and Spanish economic paper, Expansión.</P><P>He called global warming a “tragedy waiting on the horizon” that could disrupt the financial market on a large scale should investors not prepare themselves early on.</P><P>“By the time it really matters it’s too late to do anything about it.” he said.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>

        </P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><mark>Climate change</mark> will be one of the major topics at next week’s G20 summit in Hamburg. Despite US President Donald Trump’s insistence that his country would withdraw from the Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord, American companies, states and city governments have vowed to continue their push to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.</P><P>The task force calls on companies to provide detailed information on the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> policies on their bottom line, for example, by detailing how tougher <mark>carbon</mark> emissions restrictions influence profits.</P><P>“The financial stability risk is when <mark>climate policy</mark> is tightened quicker, made more rapidly, and the industry is unprepared, that’s the risk. And that’s why you want people disclosing early and thinking about it” he said.</P><P>More than 100 companies, including German insurer Allianz, natural resource producers Shell and Glencore, as well as banks like Morgan Stanley and Citigroup have said they want to comply with the proposed guidelines. The companies have a combined market cap of $3.5 trillion, and the financial institutions are responsible for about $25 trillion in assets.</P><P>The markets are already reacting. AP7, Sweden’s largest pension fund, has already said it will pull out of <mark>climate</mark> polluters such as US oil giant, Exxon-Mobil, or Russian gas producer, <mark>Gazprom</mark>.</P><P>Mr. Carney pointed out that pension funds will play a significant role in making companies respond to <mark>climate change</mark> and all sides would benefit from more information on the costs and impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on a company’s bottom line.</P><P>“You need the right recommendations around disclosure. That’s the first step. Then you need some proof that this is right which means wider spread adoption of these recommendations. That’s the next big step. And within the group of people looking at this are some of the world’s major pension funds,” he said.</P><P>“[Financial markets] react to the <mark>climate</mark> policies which are in place, or what they anticipate will come, and they will reward people and companies which manage these risks well,” he said.</P><P> </P><P><EM>Katharina Slodczyk is Handelsblatt’s London correspondent. <A href=""mailto:slodczyk@handelsblatt.com"">slodczyk@handelsblatt.com</A></EM></P><P> </P><DIV class=""paywall rs_skip""><STRONG class=""h3"">

                                                    Published on 23 February 2016 by Maria Kutuzova                                            </P></DIV><DIV class=""blog-content""><H2><P> </P><P><SPAN style=""font-size: 18px; color: #000000;"">At the start of 2016, <mark>Gazprom</mark> held an Investor Day in New York. The Russian company plans to optimise expenditure and refocus investment flows. Its capital investment programme will be significantly reduced this year, at 842 billion roubles (11 billion dollars at the current exchange rate) compared to 1,083 trillion roubles (18 billion dollars) the previous year.</SPAN></P><P> </P><P><SPAN style=""color: #000000; font-size: 18px;"">Firstly, pipelines</SPAN></P></H2><P> </P><P>Investment flows will be directed towards the projects “Power of Siberia”: resources will be used to develop various West Siberian fields and construct a pipeline exporting gas to China; and “Nord Stream I”: production at the Yamal fields and a new pipeline project towards Western Europe. <mark>Gazprom</mark>, holding fast to the glimmer of hope that the conflict with Turkey will be settled, has kept the “Turkish Stream” project on its list of priorities. According to the new plans, it will have only two lines, rather than four as previously planned. The project timeline will be decided once a Russia-Turkey intergovernmental agreement has been signed.</P><P> </P><P>The major new production projects confirmed include the start-up dates for supplies along Power of Siberia from the Chayandinskoye (2018) and Kovykta (2022) fields. Exploration of the Cenomanian-Aptian deposits at the Kharasaveyskoye field is being postponed from 2019-2022 to 2021-2025 and the Neocomian-Jurassic deposits from 2024-2025 to 2024-2027. Production of the Neocomian-Jurassic deposits at Bovanenkovo will start in 2023-2026 instead of 2022-2024. <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s offshore projects in the Arctic are also being postponed into the distant future. This means that the start-up of the Kruzenshternskoye field will be delayed from 2025-2026 to 2025-2029; Kamennomysskoye-Sea from 2021-2023 to 2023-2028; and Severo-Kamennomysskoye from 2023-2025 to 2025-2030.</P><P> </P><P>Despite announcing its hopes to optimise capital investment and strengthen its position on key export markets in Europe, including at the expense of a more flexible approach to pricing and other commercial conditions of supply, <mark>Gazprom</mark> is focusing on costly pipeline projects while also delaying implementation of most LNG projects. Only one project expanding LNG production capacity within Sakhalin II has been announced for implementation in the near future.</P><P> </P><P>The start date of the Baltic LNG project, on which <mark>Gazprom</mark> also plans to collaborate with Shell, has been postponed from 2020 to 2021. Start-up of the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye field on the Sakhalin shelf has been postponed from 2019 to 2021. The gas production targets at Yuzhno-Kirinskoye have been increased from 16 to 21 billion cubic metres per annum. Experts claim that the decision is the result of various factors, primarily the consequences of sanctions such as restricted opportunities to attract funding on both Russian and Western financial markets and the restricted resource base for LNG plants in the Far East due to the sanctions regime on the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye field. <mark>Gazprom</mark> may be unable to access the full range of technological solutions and equipment. This field was previously considered as the resource base for several LNG projects.</P><P> </P><P>Furthermore, <mark>Gazprom</mark> decided to turn down <mark>Gazprom</mark>bank’s services attracting investors to the liquefied gas projects. Even in February 2014, the company agreed with banks that it would receive a 25% stake in each Baltic LNG and Vladivostok LNG, each of which has LNG capacity of 10 million tons. <mark>Gazprom</mark>bank must take responsibility for arranging project funding and for the majority of costs until investment decisions have been approved. Due to sanctions imposed against <mark>Gazprom</mark>bank by the USA and EU in 2014, <mark>Gazprom</mark> has now changed the agreement, removing the section regarding the bank’s involvement in the charter capital of LNG projects. Vladivostok LNG has been now called off and the outlook for Baltic LNG is gloomy, despite the fact that negotiations with Shell are progressing well. In particular, at the start of this year <mark>Gazprom</mark> Chairman Alexey Miller discussed implementation of the project and the exchange of assets with members of the Shell Executive Committee, Harry Brekelmans, Maarten Wetselaar and Ronan Cassidy. Various experts doubt the economic efficiency of this project, since LNG from the Russian company has to compete with numerous other suppliers in a <mark>climate</mark> of low prices. However, <mark>Gazprom</mark> is still involved in the project since part of its infrastructure has already been created.</P><P> </P><H2><P><SPAN style=""color: #000000; font-size: 18px;"">Under sanctions</SPAN></P></H2><P> </P><P>At the start of August 2015, the United States imposed sanctions against the major <mark>Gazprom</mark> fields on the Sakhalin shelf, which were meant to supply gas to the first, and as yet only, LNG plant in Russia under the Sakhalin II project. It had previously been announced that the Kirinskoye and Yuzhno-Kirinskoye fields in the Sea of Okhotsk would become the resource base for the liquefied gas plant in Vladivostok. However, this plan was abandoned due to reviewed assessments of the hydro<mark>carbon</mark> potential at Sakhalin III.</P><P> </P><P>The Yuzhno-Kirinskoye field was included in the updated list of US sanctions against Russia. In a notice published in the US Federal Register, exports, re-exports and transfers of all items subject to the export regulation to this field by any person without first obtaining a licence from the Bureau of Industry and Security (part of the US Department of Commerce) risk violating sector sanctions against the Russian Federation. According to the US Government statement, American companies are forbidden from offering new deep sea drilling and oil prospecting technologies at this field. The US restrictions had previously been extended to sites located deeper than 152m.</P><P> </P><P>Despite the sanctions, <mark>Gazprom</mark> does not plan to cease exploration activities at Yuzhno-Kirinskoye. This information is also confirmed by the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources. Yuzhno-Kirinskoye is currently <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s largest asset on the Sakhalin shelf. According to representatives of the Russian company and various experts, the unique geological structure of the field means that Yuzhno-Kirinskoye cannot be explored without the involvement of foreign partners who have the relevant competencies.</P><P> </P><P>The Yuzhno-Kirinskoye gas and condensate field is located approximately 35 km north-east of Sakhalin Island. It forms part of the <mark>Gazprom</mark> project Sakhalin III, which is currently being implemented with its own resources. As far back as 2009, the Russian Government decided to transfer to <mark>Gazprom</mark> the licences for the Kirinsky, East-Odoptu and Ayashsky blocks in the Sea of Okhotsk. The huge Yuzhno-Kirinskoye field was discovered on the Kirinsky block in 2010. The category C1+C2 gas reserves amount to 636.6 billion cubic metres and gas condensate to 97.3 million tons.</P><P> </P><P>The Kirinskoye field is the first on the Russian shelf where production is carried out using a subsea production facility but without a platform or other above-water structures. In 2010-2015, <mark>Gazprom</mark> invested more than 260 billion roubles in creating gas production and transportation facilities on Sakhalin, the majority of which was intended to develop the Kirinskoye gas and condensate field. In 2016, <mark>Gazprom</mark> will set aside approximately 19.5 billion roubles for this purpose, principally for the ongoing construction of production wells at the Kirinskoye field.</P><P> </P><P>In 2014, <mark>Gazprom</mark> Geologorazvedka successfully finished drilling the prospecting wells at the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye field ahead of schedule: commercial inflows of raw hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s (mainly oil) were obtained, which significantly increased the field’s resource base. <mark>Gazprom</mark> has not disclosed final data for the oil reserves. However, according to provisional assessments, the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye reserves may be one of the largest fields in Russia. According to the Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, it has 464 million tons of oil. Expert assessments state that, due to the presence of large-scale oil reserves, <mark>Gazprom</mark> must change the way it develops Yuzhno-Kirinskoye.</P><P> </P><P>It is planned that the project will be reviewed and amended, even for Kirinskoye which started operation in winter 2014. The category C1 field reserves amount to 162.5 billion cubic metres of gas and 19.1 million tons of gas condensate. The gas production target is set at 5.5 billion cubic metres of gas per year. For the first time in Russian practice, a subsea production facility which can operate in difficult ice conditions is being used. A manifold is installed at the bottom of the sea, with several pipelines anchored to the same foundation, configured at high pressure and connected following a specific diagram. A cable is laid along the bottom of the ocean to guide the subsea facility to land. The subsea section of the pipeline is 28 km in length and the distance from the production site to the gas processing facility is 44 km.</P><P> </P><P>According to the Deputy Chairman of <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s Management Committee, Vitaly Markelov, production there was stopped in summer 2015, since gas extraction is stopped over summer period for technological reasons. The Head of Department 307 at <mark>Gazprom</mark>, Vsevolod Cherepanov, explained that Kirinskoye operates “as needed”: recovery of approximately 700 million cubic metres was planned for the end of 2015 and more than 1 billion cubic metres in 2016.</P><P> </P><P>In autumn 2015, VNIPIGAZDOBYCHA started the large-scale project “Construction of Kirinskoye GCF” commissioned by <mark>Gazprom</mark> Dobycha Shelf Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk at a cost of 476 million roubles. By the end of June 2016, the company must amend the field exploration project and also design various offshore and onshore sites for its construction. By way of a reminder, all equipment for the subsea production facility at Kirinskoye is supplied by the Norwegian company FMC. Norway imposed sanctions on Russia just last year, after Russia had refused a supply of Norwegian fish products. The attitude in Norway towards continued business with Russian companies is now one of suspicion, to put it mildly. Furthermore, Norwegian oil and gas equipment manufacturers depend on supplies to the USA, where one of their main markets – the Gulf of Mexico – is located. The Russian market, on the other hand, did not constitute more than 2% of the total sales volume of oil and gas equipment and services offered even before the sanctions were imposed.</P><P> </P><P>According to the plans of <mark>Gazprom</mark> Dobycha Shelf Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the next stage in exploration of the Sakhalin shelf will be entry into operation of the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye and Mynginskoye fields. Exploration of Kirinskoye (162.5 billion cubic metres of reserves) and Mynginskoye (20 billion cubic metres) within Sakhalin III must yield 8-9 billion cubic metres per year at their peak. Plans are underway to develop fields in the Ayashsky and East-Odoptu blocks once their reserves have been described by geological surveys.</P><P> </P><H2><P><SPAN style=""color: #000000; font-size: 18px;"">Exchanging assets</SPAN></P></H2><P> </P><P>According to <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s Deputy Chairman, Alexander Medvedev, Yuzhno-Kirinskoye is on the list of assets to be exchanged with Shell since Europe did not impose sanctions on Sakhalin III. Shell and <mark>Gazprom</mark> had greater plans for Yuzhno-Kirinskoye. Gas from this field was intended to supply the third liquefied gas plant under the joint project of the Sakhalin II companies. The capacity of the first Russian LNG plant is now approximately 10 million tons. The third train, to be completed by 2021, will comprise one more production line with output capacity of 5 million tons. The companies have not ruled out the option of commissioning a fourth train.</P><P> </P><P>The aforementioned deal will be completed once the British BG Group and the UK-Dutch company have merged. “The exchange of assets will not be restricted to the Sakhalin III project. The assets in the deal are strategic and comparable in terms of quality and importance,” commented Alexander Medvedev on the forthcoming exchange. During the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, <mark>Gazprom</mark> and Shell signed a cooperation agreement on the development of a partnership to implement gas projects in all segments: from exploration and production to refining and marketing. A “potential” exchange of assets was announced. It is clear that, despite the sanctions, the Russian and UK-Dutch companies have made considerable progress in discussing specific conditions of the agreement signed in June.</P><P> </P><P>The partnership between <mark>Gazprom</mark> and Shell is developing well. Alongside projects on Sakhalin, the UK-Dutch company has already joined a consortium to construct two new Nord Stream lines. <mark>Gazprom</mark> also invited Shell to become a partner in the Baltic LNG project. One of the group’s priorities is to develop gas reserves and build up its share on the global liquefied natural gas market. In early summer this year, Shell also signed a contract with NOVATEK to supply 0.9 million tons of LNG per annum over 20 years, which will be produced under the Yamal LNG project. According to Shell CEO, Ben van Beurden, 25% of global gas reserves are concentrated in the Russian Federation and are located very close to markets well-known by Shell.</P><P> </P><P>The Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum, remarked that <mark>Gazprom</mark> can get by without the technology affected by sanctions and will continue to operate at the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye field using equipment which is already being developed. The minister also stated that Russia has other foreign suppliers of the required equipment and import substitution programmes are already being run in the country. According to plans of the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade, the proportion of imported equipment for offshore projects must be reduced to 60-70% by 2020. However, Russian experts and politicians had justifiable doubts that these targets could be realistically achieved.</P><P> </P><P>The Deputy Prime Minister, Alexander Khloponin, held the opposite point of view. In his opinion, Russia missed out on the substitution of imported shelf equipment a long time ago. Russian companies must “integrate” with foreign companies which have experience in this area. At the meeting of the Government Committee on Import Substitution held in Sochi in early October, the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, honestly admitted that Russia would work towards import substitution if the government “lacks money” but, in his words, we cannot wait until the situation improves.</P><P> </P><P>According to <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s Head of the Directorate of Engineering and Offshore Field Development, Vadim Petrenko, in the current conditions Russia must build up a wide range of its own technical resources and equipment to work on the shelf, including supply vessels, helicopters, the platform and other equipment. In this case, particular attention must be paid to unique Western technologies, such as the construction of subsea production facilities, submersible wellhead equipment and high-tech services.</P><P> </P><P>According to Petrenko, new projects for large-scale exploration of offshore hydro<mark>carbon</mark> fields on the Russian shelf are essential in order to develop the country’s oil and gas industry in a robust way. “Offshore is considerably different to other areas, mainly because its key parts are located at the crossroads of the industry’s high-tech sectors. Offshore equipment is unique. In the current geopolitical conditions, we have to build up a broad range of our own technologies and equipment, including supply vessels, helicopters, floating drilling facilities and the full range of equipment. A distinction must be made between subsea production equipment and high-tech service equipment. Reducing dependence on imports is not the work of a particular group or even a company; instead it’s a task on a national scale. This is necessary so that the Russian economy returns in the direction we are used to,” Petrenko explains.</P><P> </P><P>In Petrenko’s opinion, in order to implement offshore projects, serial production of equipment must get underway. “Comprehensive solutions are needed for these projects: it is not possible to replace one riser or preventer. Some areas are now 97-100% dependent on imports, in terms of both project solutions and competencies for the construction of topsides. Discussing individual key parts does not make sense nowadays. Of Russian businesses, Corall in Sevastopol is most competent in terms of designing offshore technologies and it has a wealth of experience both in Black Sea and international projects. It is the only business which could, from both a scientific and practical perspective and owing to its knowledge of technologies available in the Russian Federation, be suited to serial production of the required equipment,” he remarked. </P><P> </P><H2><P><SPAN style=""color: #000000; font-size: 18px;"">Sakhalin II: new plans and force majeure</SPAN></P></H2><P> </P><P>In December this year, Sakhalin Energy signed an agreement to develop documentation for a project constructing the plant’s third LNG train within Sakhalin II, which will be implemented by Shell Global Solutions and the Russian design institute “Giprogazcentr”. All work will be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation and international standards to ensure that the government expert report and all necessary permits for the project’s construction phase continue to receive approval. According to the company’s plans, construction and commissioning of the third LNG train will strengthen Russia’s role as a leading producer of energy resources and its position on the Asia-Pacific market. Sakhalin Energy constructed the first and as yet only LNG production plant in the country exporting Russian LNG to international markets. Despite the decrease in hydro<mark>carbon</mark> prices, ongoing efforts with customers have provided the company with favourable conditions for oil and gas sales.</P><P> </P><P>Europe and Asia are the main importers of Russian gas. It is expected that LNG production plants will start up in Australia and Indonesia in 2016-2017. In terms of Russian projects, the new train at Sakhalin II might only start operating in 2021. According to the plans, Yamal LNG should be constructed by 2017-2018. However, according to specialists, it is highly likely that the production of liquefied gas will not start there before 2020. By that time, Australia, with its high-capacity LNG projects, will have taken second place after Qatar in terms of LNG output.</P><P> </P><P>At the end of January, Sakhalin Energy announced technical issues on LNG export terminals. The issues arose at the power station of one of the plant compressors due to the plant’s power supply being disconnected, which resulted in damage to the equipment on one of the production trains. Production consequently decreased by 50%. According to the project operator, force majeure conditions caused the LNG spot prices on the Asia-Pacific market to rise. At the start of February, the cost of LNG increased by an average of 30 cents to 5.35 dollars per million British thermal units (BTU). Several permanent customers, such as the South Korean company Kogas and a number of Japanese LNG consumers, decided to supplement their LNG reserves as a precaution. According to a statement by Sakhalin Energy, repairs on the LNG production plant will continue until March.</P><P> </P><P>The current total planned capacity of the Sakhalin Energy plant is 10-11 million tons per year. However, Sakhalin II has all technical capabilities at its disposal to expand and increase the plant’s productivity to more than 15 million tons of LNG per year. At present the company is producing oil and gas at three production platforms in the Sea of Okhotsk to the north-east of the island. Average production per day is more than 15,000 tons of oil and condensate and more than 50 million cubic metres of natural and associated gas.</P><P> </P><P>One of the clearest examples of partnership between Sakhalin Energy and Russian contractors is the agreement with Sovcomflot to construct and operate icebreaking vessels within the Sakhalin II project. An industrial park is currently under construction in Sakhalin Region to provide maintenance and repair services for equipment used at production sites, both by oil and gas project operators and by other businesses in the region. The existence on the island of an oil services cluster capable of providing these services will cover a large proportion of the work required on Sakhalin and increase Russian involvement in oil and gas projects. According to Sakhalin Energy’s head of the sector developing Russian involvement, Alexander Lapin, the company is actively searching for and attracting Russian companies and contractors to the project. At present, Russian involvement in the Sakhalin II project constitutes only 60% of the required 70%, but Sakhalin Energy has grand plans upstream, including the construction of a third LNG production train.</P><P> </P><P>At the end of 2015, the production of gas under the Sakhalin projects increased by 0.3% to 28.1 billion cubic metres. It is planned that this will increase to 30.4 billion cubic metres in 2016. Growth is forecast for all projects implemented on Sakhalin: Sakhalin I, Sakhalin II and Sakhalin III. Gas will be intended for gasification of populated areas, energy production and heating facilities in the region and also for export.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Last week, the group announced that it had divested itself from six companies it believed had violated the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement in different ways. Specifically, AP7 accused ExxonMobil, Westar, Southern Corp, and Entergy of fighting against <mark>climate</mark> legislation in the United States, <mark>Gazprom</mark> for exploring for oil in the Russian Arctic, and TransCanada for building large-scale pipelines across North America.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">“Since the last screening in December 2016, the Paris agreement to the U.N. <mark>Climate</mark> Convention is one of the norms we include in our analysis,” AP7 said in a statement.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Somewhat unsurprisingly, the companies involved have added their own voice to the discussion. In an emailed statement to news outlets, ExxonMobil said that it respectfully disagrees with the decision of AP7, “which has not communicated to us its evaluation process. We have been vocal in our support of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement, which we believe is an effective global framework for mitigating the risk of <mark>climate change</mark>.” And, to be fair, ExxonMobil has definitely loudly proclaimed its support of the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement, both when Rex Tillerson was its CEO, and afterwards, when Tillerson had moved on up in the world to be the new US Secretary of State.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">However, environmental groups are less forgiving of ExxonMobil’s efforts.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">“Sweden divesting its largest pension from Exxon proves you can’t claim to support <mark>climate</mark> action while funding and perpetuating <mark>climate change</mark>,”<A href=""https://350.org/press-release/sweden-exxon-transcanada-paris-violation-divestment/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">explained Jamie Henn</A>, Strategic Communications Director for global grassroots <mark>climate</mark> movement, 350.org. “Exxon knew about <mark>climate change</mark> half a century ago, and continues to sow doubt and bankroll <mark>climate</mark> deniers. With its core business model dependent on exploiting people and planet for profit, Exxon is in direct violation of the Paris agreement.”</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Earlier this month, <A href=""https://350.org/press-release/350-org-on-new-revelations-in-exxonknew-case/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">350.org highlighted</A> new documents from the New York State Attorney General — as part of a larger investigation as to whether ExxonMobil misled the public and investors — which showed that, while Tillerson was CEO of ExxonMobil, the company “actively misled shareholders about <mark>climate</mark> risk” and deleted “untold numbers” of documents relating to <mark>climate change</mark> — including many emails sent under Tillerson’s now-famous email alias, Wayne Tracker. More recently, ExxonMobil has found itself under mounting pressure to report on its impacts on <mark>climate change</mark>, and shareholders recently voted 62.3% in favor of such reporting.</P><P dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: justify;"">“Exxon’s <mark>climate</mark> lies are finally catching up with them,”<A href=""https://350.org/press-release/350-org-exxon-<mark>climate</mark>-vote-gets-62-support-as-pressure-on-company-continues-to-build/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">said Jamie Henn, earlier this month</A>. “The company is facing public protest, shareholder anxiety, multiple investigations, and a growing divestment campaign. They can try and run from this issue, but they can’t hide. Sooner or later, this company will be held accountable for their role in destroying our <mark>climate</mark> and putting our entire future at risk.”</P><P dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: justify;"">US energy company Entergy also expressed its disappointment in AP7’s move to divest, adding that it was “unfortunate in light of the fact that the rationale for the decision seems to be unfounded. Entergy has aggressively advocated for smart <mark>carbon</mark> policies for more than a decade,” the company said in an emailed statement. “In 2016, our <mark>CO2</mark> emissions were approximately 20 percent below our year 2000 emissions.”</P><P dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: justify;"">The other companies seem to be remaining tight-lipped on AP7’s announcement, but for 350.org, it’s all fair in love and fossil fuel warfare, and these companies are only reaping what they deserve.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">“Meanwhile, TransCanada has been championing disastrous projects like the Keystone XL pipeline, despite massive resistance from Indigenous peoples, farmers, and communities living along its route,” continued Jamie Henn. “As TransCanada attempts to move the risky pipeline forward, the company will face increasing pressure from investors who know these pipelines are a <mark>climate</mark> and financial disaster.”</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">“With Trump ditching the the Paris agreement, the onus undoubtedly falls on our cities, states, and institutions to take bold <mark>climate</mark> action: starting with divesting from the companies causing the problem. New York — where the state’s own attorney general is investigating all that Exxon knew — must follow the leadership of AP7 and divest from Exxon and its industry ilk.”</P><P><CENTER><EM><STRONG><SPAN style=""font-size: large;"">Support CleanTechnica’s work via donations on <A href=""https://www.patreon.com/CleanTechnica/overview"" rel=""nofollow""><STRONG><SPAN style=""color: #339966;"">Patreon</SPAN></STRONG></A> or <A href=""https://www.paypal.me/ImportantMedia"" rel=""nofollow""><STRONG><SPAN style=""color: #339966;"">PayPal</SPAN></STRONG></A>!</SPAN></STRONG></EM></CENTER></P></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Instead, <mark>Gazprom</mark> agreed to make deep changes to the way it has historically done business in Central and Eastern Europe, and bowed to EU rules — even submitting its contracts for verification by EU agents.</P><P>“We believe that <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s commitments will enable the free flow of gas in Central and Eastern Europe at competitive prices,” said Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition.</P><P>And she was at pains to underline that any failure to meet the terms of the deal would quickly result in billion-euro fines for the company.</P><P>That’s still not enough for the gas giant’s most ardent critics in parts of <A href=""https://www.politico.eu/pro/eastern-countries-unhappy-over-commission-<mark>gazprom</mark>-deal/"" target=""_blank"">Central and Eastern Europe</A>, who wanted the company punished with a painful fine now.</P><P>“But how about the past time period, when <mark>Gazprom</mark> was simply earning dozens of billions, if not hundreds of billions, using its monopoly on the gas market?” asked Petras Auštrevičius, a Lithuanian MEP from the ALDE Liberal group.</P><P>Monday’s announcement is the culmination of a <A href=""https://www.politico.eu/pro/five-years-of-<mark>gazprom</mark>-vs-brussels/"" target=""_blank"">long tussle</A> between Moscow and Brussels. It was launched following a complaint from Lithuania that <mark>Gazprom</mark>, which supplied all of the country’s natural gas, was abusing its market position by overcharging and banning the resale of gas — something that’s not permitted under EU rules. In all, the European Commission named eight countries in its inquiry.</P><P>All of those countries, once part of Moscow’s East European empire, worried that <mark>Gazprom</mark> was being used as a political weapon to reimpose Russian influence.</P><P>The Commission raided <mark>Gazprom</mark> offices in 2011, launched an investigation in 2012, and opened an antitrust case in 2015.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>’s risk was enormous: The Commission can impose a fine of up to 10 percent of a company’s annual turnover — in <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s case as much as €6.8 billion, according to its 2015 results.</P><P>But despite pressure from Central Europe to take a tough line, Brussels was wary of going to war with <mark>Gazprom</mark> at a time when relations between the EU and Russia were already strained thanks to Russia’s military adventures in Ukraine.</P><P>The goal, Vestager told reporters, was to correct <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s business methods and not to exact revenge.</P><P>“We found it was most helpful for citizens to have <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s future behavior changed,” she said. The goal is to make the market work, the commissioner added, “no matter the flag, no matter the ownership, no matter the size of your company.”</P><H3>The conditions of the deal</H3><P>As part of the tentative deal, <mark>Gazprom</mark> agreed to change how it negotiates gas prices with countries in Central and Eastern Europe, in an effort to create a more competitive market. They will now have the right to ask for a price review if they believe they are paying <mark>Gazprom</mark> higher gas prices than those on West European gas hubs.</P><P>It also agreed to drop clauses restricting customers’ ability to sell gas across borders and create opportunities for more gas to flow to the Baltic states and Bulgaria.</P><P>Lastly, the Russian energy company agreed to drop some demands it made by using its dominant position in Central and Eastern Europe. It said it would not seek damages from Bulgaria following the cancellation of the South Stream gas pipeline project, which was meant to bring Russian gas through Turkey and into Bulgaria.</P><P>The company committed to stick to its promises under the deal for eight years. Vestager said there will be trustees in place to ensure it follows through. Once the eight years are up, “then we will see what happens then,” she said.</P><P>Interested parties can give feedback on the settlement until May 4. Then the Commission can formally adopt the offer, ask <mark>Gazprom</mark> to improve it, or revive its inquiry backed with the threat of fines. Once the agreement becomes legally binding, the Commission can impose a fine without having to prove an infringement of EU antitrust rules if it finds <mark>Gazprom</mark> reneged on the conditions.</P><P>Settling was easier because the political optics of the dispute with <mark>Gazprom</mark> have shifted thanks to changes in the gas market and because the company has tempered its behavior.</P><P>Central European countries are reselling gas to Ukraine without much of a squawk from Moscow.</P><P>Lithuania and Poland have both opened liquefied natural gas terminals on the Baltic, giving them access to non-Russian sources of energy. Gas prices have also fallen in tandem with lower oil prices, making <mark>Gazprom</mark> contracts less painful.</P><P>And <mark>Gazprom</mark> is much more careful about offending Brussels.</P><P>“The commitments provided by <mark>Gazprom</mark> — which are a result of substantial work — demonstrate our willingness to address within the established procedure the relevant concerns of the European Commission,” said <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s Deputy Chairman Alexander Medvedev.</P><P><EM>Sara Stefanini and Kalina Oroschakoff contributed reporting.</EM></P><DIV class=""story-supplement""><FOOTER class=""content-credits""><H6>Authors:</H6></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

EU diplomats said there was little scope for either nation to block the plan. </P><P>The current regulatory framework does not allow Denmark to say “no” to the construction of transit pipelines in territorial waters on the basis of foreign policy considerations, the ministry said in a statement.  </P><P>Lilleholt said the go-ahead for the pipeline was not a matter for Denmark alone. </P><P>“It is a question of establishing a very important pipeline from Russia to Europe, this is not only a question for Denmark,” he said. </P><P>EU sources have said the Commission, sensing that there may ultimately be no legal basis to block approval of Nord Stream 2, is delaying it as long as possible. </P><P>But last week, the EU said it was seeking a mandate from members to negotiate with Russia. Lilleholt said he saw this as “very, very positive”.  </P><P>Nord Stream 2 earlier this week officially delivered its application to Danish authorities which now has to decide on permits for it to pass through Danish waters. This assessment will be made on the basis of existing rules, the ministry said. </P><P>The Nord Stream 2 project has previously said it does not see it as a task for the European Commission “to make a political judgment on whether investments are needed by the market or not”. </P><P>Denmark’s right-wing minority government would now negotiate with other parties to win support for the proposal.  </P><DIV class=""container_28wm1""><DIV class=""attribution_o4ojT""><P class=""content_27_rw"">Reporting by Stine Jacobsen; Editing by Ros Russell</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
