This paper focused on their impact on <mark>climate change</mark> and estimated the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of commercial and home-made sandwiches. The study also explored how the information on the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint could be combined with nutritional data to assist consumers in making more informed food choices. In total, 40 different recipes were considered, focusing on most popular consumer choices in the UK. The estimated impact from ready-made sandwiches ranges from 739 g <mark>CO2</mark> eq. for egg &amp; cress to 1441 g <mark>CO2</mark> eq. for the bacon, sausage &amp; egg option. The <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of the most popular home-made sandwich (ham &amp; cheese) varies from 399–843 g <mark>CO2</mark> eq. per sandwich, depending on the recipe. The average impact from the home-made option is around two times lower than the impact from the ready-made equivalent with the same ingredients. The greatest contributor to the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of both types of sandwich is the agricultural production of ingredients; for ready-made sandwiches, the preparation and retail stages are also significant. Various improvement options were considered through 22 scenarios, including changes in the cultivation of ingredients, recipe changes, reduction of food waste, alternative packaging and different waste management options. The findings suggest that reductions in the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of up to 50% are possible for ready-made sandwiches. The greatest improvement opportunities lie in reducing post-consumer waste; however, these are most difficult to realise as they involve changing consumer behaviour.</DIV></DIV><DIV class=""request-fulltext-promo pdf""><DIV class=""nova-o-media-object nova-o-media-object--gutter-m nova-o-media-object--vertical-align-middle""><DIV class=""nova-o-media-object__item nova-o-media-object__item--width-full""><P class=""nova-e-text nova-e-text--size-l nova-e-text--family-sans-serif nova-e-text--spacing-auto nova-e-text--color-inherit"">Do you want to <STRONG>read the rest</STRONG> of this article?</P><BUTTON class=""nova-c-button nova-c-button--align-center nova-c-button--radius-m nova-c-button--size-s nova-c-button--color-blue nova-c-button--theme-solid nova-c-button--width-auto ga-fulltext-request-new-promo"" type=""button""><SPAN class=""nova-c-button__label"">Request full-text</SPAN></BUTTON></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Scientists warn that these gentle and intelligent animals, among humankind’s closest kin, could become extinct within our lifetime if their rainforest homes continue to be destroyed for palm oil plantations.

It is added to chocolate, turned into fry oil, and snuck into snacks of all sorts—in fact, it can now be found in roughly half the packaged food products sold in grocery stores. This palm oil comes at a terrible human and environmental cost. Skyrocketing demand has driven massive, industrial palm oil plantations into millions of acres of formerly lush rainforest habitat in Indonesia and Malaysia, worsening <mark>climate change</mark> and causing widespread human rights violations.</P><P>This report announces the launch of an ambitious new national campaign by Rainforest Action Network (RAN ) called “The Last Stand of the Orangutan.” This campaign exposes the dark secret of conflict palm oil in the U.S. snack food industry and calls on companies to adopt responsible palm oil policies and commit to only using traceable palm oil that is free of deforestation, expansion on <mark>carbon</mark>-rich peatlands and human rights violations.</P><P>RAN ’s carefully selected “Snack Food 20” group of companies are named here publicly for the first time. This report assesses the palm oil purchasing commitments and policies of each of these influential corporations and spells out the critical role they have in reforming the destructive practices widely associated with palm oil production.</P><P>The “Snack Food 20” group of companies—Campbell Soup Company; ConAgra Foods, Inc.; Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc.; General Mills, Inc.; Grupo Bimbo; Hillshire Brands Company; H.J.

Smucker Company; Toyo Suisan Kaisha, Ltd.; and Unilever—manufacture a wide range of popular snack foods in the United States and abroad that contain conflict palm oil.</P><P>While some companies are beginning to take steps to address their palm oil problem, none have yet adopted and fully implemented adequate safeguards to eliminate conflict palm oil from entering their supply chains and contaminating their products. These big, global food companies have the power, through their supply chains, to drive a transformation in the way palm oil is now commonly produced. Increased consumer and citizen pressure on these companies is a key ingredient for success.</P><P>Working together with our families, friends, and allies, we will hold these companies to account and push them to eliminate conflict palm oil from their products. We will work with them to adopt and implement responsible palm oil procurement policies that ensure the palm oil they buy is not associated with deforestation, child or forced labor, plantation expansion on <mark>carbon</mark>-rich peatlands, or violations of forest-dependent communities’ rights.</P><P>The fate of the orangutan, forest peoples, and some of the world’s most rich and important rainforests hang in the balance.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

(<A href=""https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NSRGY"" title=""Nestle S.A. ADR"">OTCPK:NSRGY</A>), a Swiss food, and beverage company operates around the world. The company offers a wide range of products, but its name is often synonymous with chocolate. I remember an old advertisement for their products that was a jingle that went something like this: &quot;N-E-S-T-L-E-S, Nestles spells the very best, chocolate.&quot;</P><P class=""p p1"">The company has been around since way back in 1866, and with headquarters in Vevey, Switzerland, they are one of the world's leading consumers of cocoa beans. Nestlé is also a significant buyer of many other agricultural commodities required to produce their food products.</P><P class=""p p1"">Since the turn of the century, both the price of NSRGY and cocoa have moved to the upside. Population and wealth around the world have grown, which increases the demand for food. Each quarter there are approximately twenty million more people on the earth competing for finite agricultural crops, and that has increased increase the demand for both chocolate and the products that Nestlé offers the world.</P><H3 class=""p p1""><STRONG>A bullish trend in NSRGY and cocoa for two decades</STRONG></H3><P class=""p p1"">These days, the price of cocoa beans and Nestle stock are both significantly higher than they were back in 2000.</P><P class=""p p1""><EM>Source: CQG</EM></P><P class=""p p1"">As the monthly chart of ICE cocoa futures highlights, in February 2000, the price of cocoa beans was trading at the $750 per ton level.</P><P class=""p p2""><EM>Source: Barchart</EM></P><P class=""p p2"">At the same time, NSRGY shares were at the $17.20 per share level. On Tuesday, March 6, nearby ICE cocoa futures were trading at $2441 per ton, over three times the price in early 2000, while NSRY shares were at the $79.65 level, over four and one-half times higher than the price at the turn of the century. Demographics has boosted the demand for the primary ingredient in chocolate, and for Nestlé's products.</P><H3 class=""p p2""><STRONG>Cocoa breaks out to the upside</STRONG></H3><P class=""p p2"">Over recent sessions, the price of cocoa beans has broken out to the upside after a long period of consolidation. </P><P class=""p p2""><EM>Source: CQG</EM></P><P class=""p p2"">As the weekly chart shows, the price of ICE cocoa bean futures fell from highs of $3422 per ton in December 2015 to lows of $1769 per ton in June 2017. Bumper crops from the West African nations of the Ivory Coast and Ghana, the two countries that produce more than 60% of world supplies, caused the swoon in the price of the agricultural commodity. Since the lows last June, cocoa had traded in a range from just under $1800 per ton to highs of $2236, but on March 1, the price moved above the top end of the consolidation range and to highs of over $2450 per ton on March 6. The price is now at the highest level since November 2016, and that could have significant ramifications for companies, like Nestlé that are consumers of the commodity.</P><H3 class=""p p2""><STRONG>NSRGY falls with stocks</STRONG></H3><P class=""p p2"">While cocoa has been rising over recent sessions, NSRGY stock has been going the other way.</P><P class=""p p3""><EM>Source: Barchart</EM></P><P class=""p p3"">As the chart of NSRGY stock shows, after trading at a high of $89.40 per share in June 2017, the stock has moved lower and was at the $79.65 level on March 6. It is likely that the rise in the price of cocoa (and other agricultural commodities) is weighing on the price of Nestlé's shares, and the company may not be alone. Cocoa and other agricultural products are the inputs in the production of the goods these firms sell to the consumer market.</P><H3 class=""p p3""><STRONG>Cost of goods sold could impact short-term earnings</STRONG></H3><P class=""p p3"">The price of cocoa, grains, soft commodities, and meats, are the primary input when it comes to processing the foods that companies like Nestlé sells to people all over the world. When prices for the inputs move to the upside, the cost of goods sold for these companies rise. Unless they increase prices, their profit margins move lower, and the pressure of increasing prices begin to weigh on earnings. Eventually, these companies will raise their prices and individual consumers will pay for the higher raw materials, but there could be a time lag when it comes to profit margins for the companies.</P><P class=""p p3"">Over recent years, weather conditions around the world have resulted in bumper crops and stable prices for agricultural commodities. Consumers, like Nestlé, have seen prices slip, so they backed away from hedging price exposure. Purchasing managers at these firms faced the prospects of decreasing prices, so they were hesitant to lock-in prices under the fear of criticism if they wound up buying at higher levels than the current market price for the raw materials. However, when prices turn, large consumers often find themselves chasing prices higher without the ability to increase prices immediately causing their profit margins to suffer in the short-term. Price stability offers significant consumers the best environment to make money, and the current financial <mark>climate</mark> could be changing for these companies.</P><P class=""p p3"">While cocoa broke to the upside over recent trading sessions, grain prices have also been moving higher. Cocoa's ascent could be the result of weather conditions that are impacting the cocoa crop in Ghana. Dry conditions in Argentina have caused the price of soybeans and corn to move higher over recent weeks. When it comes to wheat, the price of the staple commodity that is the primary ingredient in the production of bread has moved back over the $5 per bushel level over recent days as a lack of snow cover on the winter wheat crop in the United States damaged some of the crops. The bottom line is that a rise in many agricultural commodities over recent weeks will weigh on the profits for manufacturing companies like Nestlé and many others around the world who have been procuring their requirements on a hand-to-mouth basis rather than hedging over recent years.</P><H3 class=""p p4""><STRONG>The prospects for both looking sweet in the long term</STRONG></H3><P class=""p p4"">The price of cocoa has moved higher and broke through its technical resistance level. A 50% retracement of the move from the December 2015 high to the June 2017 low could take the price of the primary ingredient in chocolate to the $2600 per ton level. Meanwhile, a continuation of a rally in cocoa, grains, and other agricultural products will likely mean that we will be paying higher prices at the supermarket for food. When it comes to NSRGY stock, technical support is around the $66 per share level which was the November 2016 and October 2014 lows. However, it will not be long before Nestlé, and the other food giants around the world will adjust their prices and profit margins will improve.</P><P class=""p p4"">I will be a buyer of NSRGY stock at the $66 level, and when it comes to cocoa and other agricultural commodities, it is all about the weather conditions these days. The past years of bumper crops could be coming to an end which would light a bullish fuse under many agricultural markets and fan inflationary flames that are already rising over recent months. Demographics have pointed to the rising demand for food around the globe even as corps were at bumper levels. If shortages develop, we could be at the beginning of a period of explosive price action in many of these agricultural commodities.</P><SPAN id=""a-inner-marketing"" class=""hidden p p4""><H3><STRONG>The Hecht Commodity Report is a must-read…</STRONG></H3><P>I believe we're on the verge of a commodities super cycle.

        Boycott Launched After Nestlé Outbids Drought-Stricken Town to Buy Well for Bottled Water

	Nestlé's grab of a Canadian community's water supply has sparked international outrage and calls to boycott the company and <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/viral-video-shows-the-insanity-of-bottled-water-1881879458.html"" target=""_blank"">bottled water</A>. More than 150,000 Facebook users are talking about the news <A href=""https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=nestl%C3%A9%20bottled%20water"" target=""_blank"">on the social media site</A>.</P><P class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""><SMALL class=""image-media media-caption"" placeholder=""add caption..."">The Council of Canadians is calling on people to sign a <A href=""https://secure.canadians.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1899&amp;ea.campaign.id=56392"" target=""_blank"">declaration</A> on its website to boycott bottled water and Nestlé.</SMALL></P><P>
	Nestlé Waters Canada, a bottled water operation of the multinational food and drink giant, outbid the Township of Central Wellington in Ontario for water rights to a local well to ensure &quot;<A href=""http://www.nestle-waters.ca/en/water-sources-n-quality/middlebrook-project/your-questions-our-answers"" target=""_blank"">future business growth</A>.&quot;</P><P>
	The company is already permitted to pull up to 3.6 million liters (roughly 951,000 gallons) of water a day for its bottling operations in nearby Aberfoyle, but decided to swoop up the well near Elora, Ontario in order &quot;to supplement our operations in Aberfoyle.&quot;
</P><P>
	According to the <A href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/nestle-outbids-small-ontario-municipality-to-buy-well-for-bottled-water/article31999831/"" target=""_blank"">Globe and Mail</A>, the company bought the well from Middlebrook Water Company last month after having made a conditional offer in 2015.</P><P>
	The reason this issue has blown up is because the Township of Centre Wellington wanted to buy the spring water well for itself in order to safeguard the drinking water supply the growing community, mayor Kelly Linton explained to <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/24/canada-nestle-water-well-bid-centre-wellington"" target=""_blank"">The Guardian</A>.</P><P>
	The township has a population of about 30,000 but &quot;by 2041, we'll be closer to 50,000 so protecting our water sources is critical to us,&quot; he said.</P><P>
	Not only that, much of the province of Ontario is experiencing record drought conditions, with rainfall 100 millimeters below normal in some areas from April to June, the <A href=""http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/once-in-a-decade-dryness-rainless-ontario-verges-into-drought-and-theres-no-end-in-sight"" target=""_blank"">National Post</A> reported in July.</P><P class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""><SMALL class=""image-media media-caption"" placeholder=""add caption..."">A drought intensity map released by Agriculture Canada on June 17, showing &quot;moderate drought&quot; across eastern Ontario.</SMALL><SMALL class=""image-media media-photo-credit"" placeholder=""add photo credit..."">Agriculture Canada</SMALL></P><P>According to The Guardian, when township authorities learned that Nestlé was trying to buy the well, they scrambled over the summer to come up with a counter-offer.</P><P>&quot;We put in more money than they did and we removed all conditions,&quot; Linton said. The amount has not been specified.</P><P>
	But Nestlé, which had right of first refusal, was able to match the township's offer and won the well for itself. </P><P>&quot;As you can appreciate we aren't going to be outbidding Nestlé,&quot; Linton said. &quot;As a small town we're using taxpayer dollars, so we have to be good stewards of that.&quot; </P><P>Nestlé was reportedly unaware of the township's counter-offer until after the purchase was made. Since securing the well, the company <A href=""http://www.nestle-waters.ca/en/water-sources-n-quality/middlebrook-project/your-questions-our-answers"" target=""_blank"">said</A> it has submitted an application to the Ontario Ministry of Environment and <mark>Climate Change</mark> to conduct an aquifer pump test to determine if the water source meets the company's internal requirements &quot;as well as ensure it can be operated in a <mark>sustainable</mark> manner.&quot; If the source at the Middlebrook well site meets Nestlé's requirements, the company will seek a permit that allows it to draw water at 300 gallons a minute, Nestlé said. </P><P>However, Wellington Water Watchers, a local volunteer group, plans to block the company's plans. </P><P>&quot;We are fighting tooth and nail to not allow that pump test to go ahead,&quot; Mike Nagy of the group told The Guardian. </P><P>The Wellington Water Watchers pointed out in a <A href=""https://www.facebook.com/thewellingtonwaterwatchers/posts/1060458460689037"" target=""_blank"">Facebook post</A> that Nestlé's latest move will vastly increase plastic <mark>pollution</mark> due to the wastefulness of bottled water. </P><P style=""margin-left: 20px;"">&quot;Think about the plastic we will stop being produced by saying NO to the Nestle permit renewals and the recent purchase of the Middlebrook Well. 6.4 million liters a day would translate into 12 million plastic packages per day! This is how much water they would have access to if they get the permit in Elora Centre Wellington as they already have 4.7 million liters day. Use the 4th R, REFUSE.&quot;</P><P>The Council of Canadians is also <A href=""http://canadians.org/media/boycott-against-nestle-and-bottled-water-products-launched-council-canadians#.V-VVqHhqUaE.twitter"" target=""_blank"">urging</A> a national boycott of Nestlé. A media release for the boycott states: </P><P style=""margin-left: 20px;"">&quot;This summer, while many parts of southern Ontario faced drought conditions, Nestlé continued to pump more than 4 million litres of groundwater every day from an aquifer near Guelph. Nestlé pays less than $15 per day for this water, which it then ships out in hundreds of millions of single-use plastic bottles for sale all over North America.&quot;</P><P>&quot;The water crisis is at our door here in Canada,&quot; Council of Canadians chairperson Maude Barlow <A href=""http://canadians.org/media/boycott-against-nestle-and-bottled-water-products-launched-council-canadians"" target=""_blank"">said</A>. &quot;Groundwater resources are finite and are currently taxed by <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/the-link-between-<mark>climate</mark>-change-and-drought-1891181604.html"">droughts</A>, <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/<mark>climate</mark>-change/""><mark>climate change</mark></A> and over-extraction. At this pace, we will not have enough for our future needs. Wasting our limited groundwater on frivolous and consumptive uses such as bottled water is a recipe for disaster. We must safeguard groundwater reserves for communities and future generations.&quot;</P><P>Additionally, as Barlow <A href=""http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/09/23/travesty-nestle-outbids-another-town-control-local-water-supply"" target=""_blank"">told</A> the Canadian Press, the new Elora well is located near a First Nation's reserve, potentially putting their water supply at risk.</P><P>&quot;[The well] sits on the traditional territory of the Six Nations of the Grand River, 11,000 of whom do not have access to clean running water,&quot; Barlow said. </P><P>Nestlé's has been making many recent headlines over its bottling operations. Last week, <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/nestle-bottled-water-drought-2012310851.html"" target=""_blank"">EcoWatch reported</A> that the Swiss conglomerate is now legally permitted to take water from the San Bernardino National Forest in California on a permit that expired back in 1988.</P><P>A federal judge ruled that the corporation can continue its use of a 4-mile pipeline that siphons thousands of gallons of public water a day from the Strawberry Creek watershed and sell it back to the public as bottled water. The water is sold under the Arrowhead brand.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""sPost_0_4_0_0_0_1_1_0_0_0_1_0_1"" class=""post-partial article__comments""><DIV class=""article-content__comments-wrapper""><DIV class=""action-btn js-toggle js--active"" data-target=""#comments-widget"" data-toggle-class=""hidden"">Show Comments (</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Even as he steps down from the top rung at Nestle next year and starts preparing to come down safely from the top - an important principle that he says applies to both mountaineering and the corporate world - he plans to remain involved in advisory work and keep himself close to political and economic developments.</P><P><STRONG>How it started</STRONG></P><P>Mr Brabeck's interest in water started when he was pondering on future issues that Nestle would face when it celebrated its 140th anniversary in 2006. After much analysis, he came down to one singular issue: water.</P><P>&quot;It became obvious that without water there wouldn't be life, there wouldn't be consumers, there wouldn't be agriculture production which is very important for a food and beverage company,&quot; he says. &quot;There wouldn't be water for our factories. There wouldn't be water in order to prepare our products, many of which are dehydrated products like Nescafe.</P><P>&quot;So water crystallised to be the most important single factor for the long term development of our company.&quot;</P><P>Upon a closer study, however, he found an alarming situation. Water resources were being overdrawn by about 10 per cent, he says.</P><P>To accelerate reforms in water management, Mr Brabeck, with other like-minded individuals and companies, formed the 2030 Water Resources Group - a public-private-expert-civil society platform - in 2008. According to the group, the gap between water supply and demand will reach 40 per cent in 2030, if current practices continue.</P><P>Already, at that point, large lakes such as the Aral Sea in central Asia and Lake Chad in Africa were disappearing, and cities such as Jakarta and New Orleans were sinking as underground water reservoirs got depleted, says Mr Brabeck. &quot;There was already quite a crisis at this point in time but nobody was really aware of it. So the first aspect was to create awareness about the phenomenon.&quot;</P><P>This the group did by publishing reports and analysing opportunities to balance supply and demand, watershed by watershed.</P><P>Since then, awareness of water being a critical issue has &quot;increased substantially&quot;, says Mr Brabeck, citing how the World Economic Forum has placed water as the top risk for long-term economic development last year and this year.</P><P>Still, there is now a greater water deficit than before, of about 20 per cent, &quot;so the crisis has become even stronger than it was 10 years ago&quot;, he adds.</P><P>The problem can be solved, he believes. &quot;We have the technology for those but what is missing is the political will in order to improve water governance. It's a water management issue, not so much a water issue. With the water that is available we can easily serve up to 10 billion people - but not the way we are using water today.&quot;</P><P>In many developing countries, the government provides subsidies for water in order to ensure accessibility for its entire population. In practice, however, such policies backfire.</P><P>&quot;The reality is that due to an imperfect infrastructure, those who have higher incomes have access to tap water resources and they enjoy a subsidised price. Those people living in slumps don't have access to tap water and they have to acquire (the water) through tankers and water vendors.&quot;</P><P>The concept of economies of scale should also be thrown out the window when thinking about water pricing, he adds. &quot;If you have a pricing system which makes water cheaper because you're using more, the one who fills up the swimming pool gets the water at the lower cost - another fallacy of the system.&quot;</P><P>On top of poorly conceived water policies, there is a large investment deficit in the sector. &quot;Most of the infrastructure is old, and we have huge leakage losses. This is not only in developing countries, but also in developed countries whether in US or Europe.&quot;</P><P>Every person, Mr Brabeck says, needs 25 litres of water a day: five litres for hydration, and 20 litres for minimum hygiene. Still, only 1.5 per cent of water use in the world goes towards this purpose. The balance is used irresponsibly, whether because water is mispriced, or due to inefficient use in agriculture and food.</P><P>&quot;In agriculture we are using 2.5 times more water than what the plants really will need. That alone shows you there is a great opportunity for saving,&quot; he says. &quot;The second one is just the waste that we are producing by the lack of infrastructure (in transporting food in developing countries) or by throwing away food (in developed countries).&quot;</P><P>About two-fifths of all food produced is wasted, he adds. &quot;If you would just diminish the food waste we already solve a big part of the water problem.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Controversial moments</STRONG></P><P>While he might have achieved success in bringing water to the agenda of world leaders in recent years, Mr Brabeck's path to water advocacy hasn't always been smooth sailing.</P><P>Just a few years ago, comments he made previously in a 2005 documentary erupted into controversy. In the documentary on food security, Mr Brabeck had made an appearance, speaking on water.</P><P>He said then: &quot;It's a question of whether we should privatise the normal water supply for the population. And there are two different opinions on the matter. The one opinion, which I think is extreme, is represented by the NGOs, who bang on about declaring water a public right. That means that as a human being you should have a right to water. That's an extreme solution.</P><P>&quot;The other view says that water is a foodstuff like any other, and like any other foodstuff it should have a market value...Personally, I believe it's better to give a foodstuff a value so that we're all aware it has its price, and then that one should take specific measures for the part of the population that has no access to this water.&quot;</P><P>These comments sparked a backlash on the Internet, with many criticising his apparent stand that water isn't a human right. Nestle, in response, released a statement on the website and a video interview with Mr Brabeck, clarifying that this wasn't the case.</P><P>Asked about the episode, Mr Brabeck replies calmly that he has never said water isn't a human right. Rather, he was referring to the 98.5 per cent of irresponsible water use, which stems from water not having been assigned the right value. &quot;I was proposing to the United Nations that water be declared a human right. So (it's) funny enough I was being accused of being against water as a human right,&quot; he says, smiling.</P><P>As the head of Nestle, Mr Brabeck is nevertheless used to controversy. The group had been the target of a boycott in the 1970s, when it aggressively marketed breast milk substitutes, especially in less developed countries.</P><P>In 2010, it also got into trouble for the use of un<mark>sustainable</mark> palm oil. In a video by environmental group Greenpeace, a bored office worker bites off a finger of Kit Kat that turns into a bloody finger of an orang utan.</P><P>Nestle's initial response was to make YouTube take down the video, citing copyright. But this gained the company more brickbats.</P><P>Within months, it adapted its approach, suspending purchases from the offending supplier Sinar Mas and engaging a credible external partner to certify the sustainability of its palm oil suppliers. It also created a new post of global head of digital and social media, which eventually led to a team that monitors social media sentiment around the clock.</P><P>&quot;There is no doubt that social media has certainly changed the communication role,&quot; says Mr Brabeck. &quot;And like anything else in life you have to learn how to move into this new space.&quot;</P><P>The change in the communication landscape has also changed the way the company is responding, he adds. &quot;What is absolutely vital is total transparency. There is no way today that you can try to hide or even not to recognise (issues).&quot;</P><P>Citing accusations levelled against Nestle last year of using forced labour, Mr Brabeck says it did not immediately refute the charges &quot;although we don't have forced labour in our supply chain&quot;.</P><P>&quot;We are saying, well, we know within Nestle there is none. But let's find out if outside of Nestle, on the supplier side, there might be one.&quot;</P><P>The company engaged an external party to conduct an independent investigation, which found forced labour in its seafood supply chains in Thailand, confirming media reports. &quot;We published this on social media to everybody. And we were completely transparent and said that well, we realised that there is in Nestle but within the total supply chain which includes suppliers.&quot;</P><P>&quot;Therefore we're going to work together with the government and NGOs in order to ensure that this doesn't happen. It is a completely different approach than perhaps 20 years ago.&quot;</P><P>The relationship between civil society and private companies itself has also evolved. &quot;Only 15 years ago this was a controversial and confrontational relationship,&quot; says Mr Brabeck. &quot;NGOs accusing especially MNCs of misbehaviour in one way or another, and those MNCs trying to prove those accusations are not true.&quot;</P><P>Many years were spent playing this fruitless game of ping pong, with each party more interested in dragging the other down than solving the problem. &quot;Nobody really cared about the subject, which was quite interesting,&quot; Mr Brabeck quips.</P><P>In the last few years, both sides have recognised that it would be better if solutions to the problem were placed in the middle of the relationship, and both adopted a more collaborative approach.</P><P>Today Nestle works with many NGOs including its former nemesis Greenpeace in areas of deforestation and palm oil, among others. &quot;I think we have a very good collaboration there, which does not mean that on every single subject we have exactly the same opinion,&quot; says Mr Brabeck. &quot;We can still have different opinions when it comes to genetically modified organisms, between Greenpeace and us, but instead of only concentrating on confrontation, we can also work together to solve other problems where we have common interests.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>The next chapter</STRONG></P><P>With the company in good shape, Mr Brabeck is confident that he will be able to arrange an orderly succession when he steps down next year.</P><P>Speaking at an event in Singapore in 2004, when he was stepping down as Nestle CEO, Mr Brabeck had said that it is equally important to climb down safely before one can claim one has succeeded.</P><P>&quot;There's one thing in mountain-climbing which is important also for business,&quot; said the avid mountain climber. &quot;You are only successful on the mountain climb when you come back to the valley healthy. Most of the accidents happen when you are coming down from the top. That's where most people fail.&quot;</P><P>Succession planning, he tells BT, has to be done on an ongoing basis. As a company, Nestle plans for scenarios where everybody, from the chairman downwards, has to be replaced within 24 hours, as part of emergency succession planning. &quot;If something happens to me, tomorrow you'll have a new (Nestle) chairman,&quot; he says.</P><P>Then there is also more longterm planning, which would take into consideration the successor's age and capability, among other factors. &quot;It doesn't have to be the same person.&quot;</P><P>Life away from the peak of the corporate world, however, will not be any less busy for Mr Brabeck.</P><P>Besides staying on as the vice-chairman of World Economic Forum's Foundation Board and remaining on the advisory board for several companies, there are also numerous businesses he has built up on the side to attend to: fish farming, caviar production and real estate.</P><P>The recreational pilot, who flies both helicopters and fixed-wing planes, will also be spending more time in the skies. &quot;So I'll be very busy,&quot; he says, beaming.</P><P>And of course, there are the mountains, though these days he scales those that are not too high. &quot;I would say every year you are older, the mountains get higher,&quot; he laughs.</P><P><STRONG>PETER BRABECK</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

                                         , create an astounding 264 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions every year — as much as 69 coal-fired power plants. If these “Big 10” were a country, it would be the 25th biggest polluter on the planet, spewing more emissions than oil and gas producers Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.</P><P>The emissions these companies cause are contributing to a growing humanitarian catastrophe. By 2050, there could be 50 million more people made hungry because of <mark>climate change</mark>. More frequent, unpredictable and extreme storms, floods, droughts and shifting weather patterns are affecting food supplies, driving up food prices and causing more hunger and poverty.</P><P>These disruptions are bad news for both food companies and their investors. Unilever says it now loses $415 million per year due to extreme weather events such as flooding and extreme cold. In March of this year, General Mills’ CEO Ken Powell said that in the previous quarter, extreme weather had dampened sales and cost his company 62 days of production, “which hasn’t happened in a long time to us, think decades.”</P><P>These types of losses could just be the tip of the iceberg. Oxfam’s projections show that the price we pay for cereal brands like Kellogg’s Corn Flakes and General Mills’ Kix could spike by as much as 30% in the next 15 years because of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The good news for the “Big 10” food companies is that they are immensely powerful players in the sector, with the influence to drive serious emissions reductions using existing tools and technologies. Oxfam’s report showed that if these 10 companies replicated the best practice in the industry, they could cut a further 80 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 — equivalent to taking all of the cars in Los Angeles, Beijing, London and New York off the road. </P><P>Some companies are already on the right path to reducing emissions and disclosing their progress. Unilever, Nestle and Coca-Cola are leading the pack, though even they have a ways to go. Yet too many companies are standing by silently, hoping the crisis will solve itself. Kellogg and General Mills stand out as among the worst of the “Big 10” in this regard.</P><P>More than half of the greenhouse gas emissions caused by big food companies comes from their supply chains. Yet General Mills and Kellogg don’t even have targets to cut supply-chain emissions. They do little to ensure that their suppliers are growing ingredients responsibly and reducing emissions. Even though these companies spend tens of millions of dollars to influence government policies on issues from food safety to nutrition standards, they stand by silently as fossil-fuel companies lobby to prevent ambitious <mark>climate</mark> action.</P><P>That’s where investors and consumers come into the picture. These two groups have a great deal to lose if the food industry continues to drag its feet in response to the real and present dangers posed by <mark>climate change</mark>. They also have significant sway over how companies operate. If consumers and investors speak out and urge the food industry to be a part of the solution to <mark>climate change</mark>, companies will have no choice but to listen.</P><P>Already many large investors and more than 239,000 people have joined Oxfam to call for more ambitious <mark>climate</mark> action from the food industry. The time has come for Big Food to step up.</P><P><EM>Raymond C. Offenheiser is the president of Oxfam America.

a member of the World Bank Group, and Nespresso, with support from the
Bio<mark>Carbon</mark> Fund Initiative for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Forest Landscapes, will help
coffee farmers in Ethiopia and Kenya get needed financing and improve agricultural
practices to boost productivity and quality in a <mark>sustainable</mark>, <mark>climate</mark>-smart
way. 
IFC will lend Nespresso Sustainability <mark>Innovation</mark> Fund $3 million to finance
planting of shade trees and technical assistance. In its first private
sector project, the Bio<mark>Carbon</mark> Fund Initiative for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Forest Landscapes,
managed by the World Bank, will provide an additional $3 million grant
to enhance environmental sustainability through farmer training and improvements
to wet mill operations in the Oromia Region of Ethiopia. The grant will
be managed by IFC’s advisory team, which in collaboration with TechnoServe
will provide technical assistance and oversee training and planting. TechnoServe,
an international NGO, is a long-time partner of Nespresso and IFC, and
focuses on building commercially <mark>sustainable</mark> agricultural ventures.</FONT><FONT size=""2"" face=""Arial"">
Jean-Marc Duvoisin, CEO of Nespresso, said: “This joint initiative is
a good example of how industry and the public sectors can work together
to support the <mark>sustainable</mark> development of coffee farming. Improving productivity
and the quality of coffee harvests is a triple win - benefiting our customers,
the environment and paving the way to higher incomes for farmers.”
IFC Director for Manufacturing, Agribusiness and Services Alzbeta Klein
said, “The coffee industry is one of the largest sources of employment
for farmers in rural Ethiopia and Kenya and is dominated by smallholder
producers.  IFC has been working with Nespresso for several years,
and together we recognize the potential of the AAA program as a business-led
development tool. Projects like this are a game changer for them, giving
them the opportunity to invest in their coffee plantations, become more
productive and <mark>sustainable</mark>, and become part of a global supply chain.”</FONT><FONT size=""2"" face=""Arial"">
This project is part of Nespresso’s AAA <mark>Sustainable</mark> Quality Program which
has worked with more than 40,000 smallholder coffee farmers to provide
technical and financial support to increase <mark>sustainable</mark> practices and plant
trees on their land. Reforestation of this kind helps to make farms more
resilient to <mark>climate change</mark>. The farmers will also receive training in
agricultural best practices to help them improve their productivity and
the quality of their coffee harvests – enabling them to earn more money.</FONT><FONT size=""2"" face=""Arial"">“This milestone achievement is an example of how partnerships between
the public and private sectors working together can reach more communities
and establishes a model for us to build on for years to come,” said John
Roome, Senior Director for <mark>Climate Change</mark> at the World Bank. “The first-of-its-kind
collaboration is based on shared goals of ensuring a ‘greener’ approach
to planting and processing, higher productivity for farmers, and making
the coffee industry in Ethiopia more resilient to <mark>climate change</mark>.</FONT><FONT size=""2"" face=""Arial"">
Agribusiness is a priority for IFC because of its potential for promoting
rural incomes and food security. IFC combines investments and advice to

The planet is warming with severe consequences that threaten business growth and a healthy economy. We believe that we have reached a tipping point on <mark>climate change</mark> and that there is an unstoppable shift to a global economy that is significantly less harmful to the environment.  As the world transitions to this new economy, it will be important to provide economic progress and a higher quality of life for all people in all regions of the world.   </P><P>The private sector will play a key role in this transition and can help build prosperity and secure a better world for what will soon be nine billion people. Increasingly, business leaders are working collaboratively with competitors and with nongovernmental organizations to set goals to significantly reduce natural-resource use, invest in clean energy, improve global health and feed more people. A common thread that cuts across all of these efforts is finding new and innovative ways to use technology to achieve these social and environmental commitments. </P><P>No company is perfect. But, all companies are made up of people who want to leave a higher quality of life and a better world for generations to come. As leaders of these companies, we are committed to using our <mark>innovation</mark>, scale and entrepreneurial spirit to seek ways to address both the environmental and societal challenges created by <mark>climate change</mark>. Ahead of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> negotiations this December, we will help do our part to facilitate the transition to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy.  </P><P><STRONG>WBCSD Signatories</STRONG>:</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

(Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg News)</SPAN></DIV><P>Food is a necessity, but it's also a big business.</P><P>That duality has often pitted consumers against the powerful food corporations that farm, produce, and ultimately feed large swaths of the global population, especially on questions of health and sustainability. But with national diets in this country <A href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/06/18/the-rise-of-processed-and-fast-foods-and-the-ever-expanding-american-waistline/"" target=""_blank"">leading to obesity and diabetes epidemics</A> and global issues around poverty, food waste and <mark>climate change</mark>, consumers and producers are having new discussions about their relationship to one another.</P><P>Few, if any, companies will play as central a role in these issues as Nestlé S.A., the world's largest food and beverage company, which makes everything from chocolate (Crunch, Toll House, and Butterfinger) and coffee (Nespresso), to baby food (Gerber), pizza (DiGiorno), milk (Skinny Cow), ice cream (Haagen-Dazs), and packaged meals (Hot Pockets, Lean Cuisine).</P><P>I sat down with Nestle S.A.'s vice president and global head of operations José Lopez, who's also often described as the company's head of sustainability, even though the company doesn't technically have someone with that title. We discussed how <mark>climate change</mark> is affecting the company, how the company is working to affect <mark>climate change</mark>, what sustainability means in the corporate food world, and the company's responsibility to the people who eat its food, especially given its size.</P><DIV class=""inline-content inline-photo-left"" style=""width:200px;""><SPAN class=""pb-caption"">José Lopez, the Executive Vice President and Head of Global Operations for Nestlé S.A., is pictured. (Source: Nestlé S.A.)</SPAN></DIV><P><STRONG>Why doesn't Nestlé have a head of sustainability? </STRONG></P><P>I am seen by the outside world as the head of sustainability here, because I do attend to issues of sustainability, but in essence we don't have one. The problem is that these positions are often part of public affairs or corporate affairs, or corporate communications, but the story shouldn't be how we talk about sustainability—it should be about what we do about sustainability. So for us, operations comes first and talking comes next.</P><P>For some time this was actually a little frustrating to some of our management members, because people didn't know what we were doing behind the scenes. But you cannot work to tell people; you have to work to do the right thing.</P><P><STRONG>What then does sustainability mean for <STRONG>Nestlé</STRONG>?</STRONG></P><P>Sustainability is not only making sure that our business model is able to survive but that we live in a society that is in harmony with what we want our business to be in the future. You have to be relevant, you have to be in tune with what society needs, so that your business can continue to work over the long term.</P><P>We are a very long-term oriented company. There was a time when our company decided to take its stock from all trading stock markets aside from the one in Zurich. The reason was that we no longer wanted to do quarterly reporting, because we found that this was nonsense for a company like ours. To change your decision-making on numbers you're going to have to give each quarter, when it takes years to put products in place, build factories, find distribution, and bring forward a brand, doesn't make sense.</P><P><STRONG>But sustainability isn't a static term. It has a very different meaning today than it did, say, 150 years ago, when Nestlé was founded. How has its meaning changed?</STRONG></P><P>On one side of the equation, you have technology, and access to technology. This has a big and positive impact. Society now demands more transparency, because we're able to provide more transparency. Corporations have received a renewed mandate by society. We have to take responsibility for things that in the past we didn't feel we had the legitimacy to. The role that we are given by society is changing, and rapidly, and, in my mind, in a very positive manner.</P><P>But we also now know a lot more about what can be done. The science and technology that we already know, and information that we already have, is sufficient to tackle the very pressing issues that the planet, the earth, is facing. We know how to achieve <mark>sustainable</mark> farming, we know how to achieve <mark>sustainable</mark> harvesting of many of our key ingredients, but when you look around, you realize that this is just a drop in the ocean. It's just starting.</P><P>So the question is how can we scale this up. For that we need to engage everyone, including the media.</P><P><STRONG>What about specific sustainability issues, like <mark>climate change</mark>. How is <mark>climate change</mark> affecting <STRONG>Nestlé </STRONG>on the back end, and behind the scenes?</STRONG></P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> has many impacts on the value chain. We source a tremendous amount of raw materials, as you can imagine. We are the biggest buyer of cocoa in the world, and one of the biggest buyers of coffee in the world. Both of those commodities have gotten more expensive as a result of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>Are those prices reflected in profit margins for farmers?</STRONG></P><P>They are, and they must be. Otherwise this whole thing will become un<mark>sustainable</mark>. If there isn't a means for farmers to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>, as we see it, then the children of today's farmers will not become farmers.</P><P>Farming has to become a different player in the eyes of the consumer. I am convinced that consumers will accept and understand that food cannot be the place where you save most of your money. It has to be the place where you have to have a value understanding. We need to educate everyone about the <EM>real</EM> value of their purchasing activities.</P><P><STRONG>But what if everyone simply can't afford more expensive food? How do we feed a growing population, given the amount of hunger and poverty that already persists in the world?</STRONG></P><P>The first thing is we need to stop waste. Food waste is an incredible and absurd issue for the world today. The numbers that come around are always in the neighborhood of 30 to 35 percent--meaning that a third of what is produced is wasted, which also has an environmental impact. But beyond that environmental impact is the impact on soil, on water, on the resources and our natural capital that we impose for the benefit of no one.</P><P>Unfortunately what happens is poorer countries can't afford to waste food, because it's such a large part of their disposable income, while in the Western world it is such a small part of disposable income that it's okay to waste from an economic standpoint. Because of that waste, you have to raise prices, which the people in those poorer countries, the ones who don't have the money, then have to pay. You see this happening with all kinds of goods around the world.</P><P>What is important for companies like ours is to make sure that we don't participate in processes that produce unintended consequences that go against our interests in the long term. That is a perfect example. And we are not going to sacrifice the long-term sustainability of our business for short-term gains.</P><P><STRONG>There's another form of sustainability that more directly affects consumers: Health. We don't know a lot about how foodstuffs affect people, because the narrative is constantly changing. How does a company like <STRONG>Nestlé </STRONG>reconcile that, and deal with those violent swings?</STRONG></P><P>When people talk about the food industry and food companies, they are intuitively referring to packaged goods, and, specifically, branded packaged goods. When you look at the amount of food a human being ingests, the part that is branded packaged goods is actually a very small part. But in terms of total calories or total nutrients, it happens to be the most attractive part, partly because they have been adapted using science to make them taste better.</P><P>We have to take responsibility for that. I will be the first one to say that we have done a very poor job explaining to the world why we exist as an industry, what we bring to society, and what the world would look like if we didn't exist.</P><P>It's like speaking about packaging. Packaging is a huge source of littering and other negative environmental impact. But can we take packaging away from food? You know what will happen, and immediately? The amount of waste will multiply by who knows how much if we take away packaging from our food system.</P><P>Instead we need to sit back and understand that we have an issue with packaging, agree that we have an issue with caloric intake, especially attractive caloric intake because of branding, and take responsibility for improving the health status down the road.</P><P>We need to lower the amount of sugar and sodium we have in our food. We also have to apply a better understanding of nutrition and portion control. We have done a terrible job explaining to consumers why we existed, because we were too busy competing with each other.</P><P><STRONG>So, why then does <STRONG>Nestlé </STRONG>exist?</STRONG></P><P>Because it would be impossible to feed 7 billion people, let alone billions more to come, without it. Because we need to preserve food, and safely, so consumers can eat and drink under any condition and in any season. The reason why we exist, primarily, is that human beings decided to live together, because of urbanization.</P><P>Today there is a very close relationship between urbanization and the food industry. We have to provide food all the time, during every season, and it needs to be safe, affordable, and so on and so forth. That's our job.</P><P>Now, in order to do that job, you shouldn't hurt anybody. You shouldn't hurt the people who produce the food or the people that consume the food. That's what we need to work on.</P><P><STRONG>How far is Nestlé willing to go to achieve that? If there were a product that wasn't good for people to consume, would the company stop selling it?</STRONG></P><P>I don't think there are any products that aren't good for people to consume. There are substances that aren't good for people to consume, and there is always the notion of quantity and portion control. Human beings are able to process a lot of things, and we have the mechanism to live in an environment that isn't always friendly, but we adapt.</P><P>What we need is to understand [food] microbiology better.

</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></HEADER><DIV class=""content__article-body from-content-api js-article__body"" itemprop=""articleBody"" data-test-id=""article-review-body""><P><A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/nestle"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Nestlé</A> chairman Peter Brabeck has a history of courting controversy and is likely to further inflame his critics with his belief that man-made emissions are not the primary reason behind our changing <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>While <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/<mark>sustainable</mark>-business/blog/ipcc-report-business-investor-response"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">scientists point to the near certainty that human activity</A> is driving up temperatures, Brabeck argues that it is largely down to Earth's natural cycles, and warns against trying to play god by seeking to stop global warming. Instead, he believes society should focus on adaptation.</P><P>Sitting in the Swiss mountain ski resort of Davos after we have both listened to the Tanzanian president tell the heartbreaking story of how global warming is making life increasingly unbearable for his people, Brabeck told me that:</P><P>&quot;<mark>Climate change</mark> is an intrinsic part of the development of the world. Since the world has existed we have had <mark>climate change</mark>s and we will have <mark>climate change</mark> as long as the world exists ... For me the issue is more about what can we do in order to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark> and perhaps to try to gain more time … Are we God to say the <mark>climate</mark>, as it is today, is the one we have to keep? That's the way it's going to be? We are not God. What we have to assure is that <mark>climate change</mark> happens within a timeframe that humankind can adapt to.&quot;</P><P>Brabeck says that <mark>carbon</mark> emissions are a factor but are merely speeding up what is already a natural occurrence.</P><P>&quot;If too much <mark>CO2</mark> emission is accelerating <mark>climate change</mark> in a manner that will take away the possibility for us to adapt to it then we have a problem, but what I think is wrong to say is that we are going to stop <mark>climate change</mark> today,&quot; he says. &quot;It's not the natural approach. What we have to get to grips with is the speed with which <mark>climate change</mark> is happening and to have the same speed for us to adapt to it.&quot;</P><P>One senior business leader who knows the Nestlé chairman well, claims he is a complex character whose views on <mark>climate</mark> do not sit easily with him playing a leading role in driving the issue of water scarcity up the global political agenda.</P><P>Chief executives from progressive companies, who focused their time at the World Economic Forum on seeking to build a common business platform ahead of the UN <mark>climate</mark> summit in September, will be unhappy to see Brabeck undermine their position. Brabeck's views are also not likely to be welcomed within Nestlé, given that global head of operations José Lopez has been working hard to build the company's reputation as a leader in emissions reduction.</P><P>One senior executive of Nestlé told me that Brabeck had no direct responsibility for the <mark>climate</mark> issue within Nestlé. He pointed to the Swiss multinational food and beverage company topping a league table of corporates who have made efforts to disclose and cut <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, published by the international NGO CDP.</P><P>While Brabeck will have stoked the debate on <mark>climate change</mark>, he also sought to dampen the <A href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=405Phamwsgg"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">controversy last year</A> in which he was accused by some NGOs of arguing for the privatisation of water and claiming is not a human right.</P><P>Brabeck told me that campaigners &quot;used an old video of 2005 of me and cut it down in the manner that it was most suitable to them. To say that I have said water is not a human right is the biggest lie I have heard. I have been fighting for water as a human right for hydration and hygiene since the beginning but I have always said this is 1.5% of the water that we are using. There is no doubt this is a human right and it is a right that has to be assured by governments. But this has nothing to do with the irresponsible usage of water of the other 98.5% of it.&quot;</P><P>Brabeck also defended Nestlé against accusations by Baby Milk Action that it contributes to the unnecessary death and suffering of infants around the world by aggressively marketing baby foods.</P><P>&quot;We are the only infant formula producer which is part of FTSE4Good. We are being checked and controlled by FTSE4Good. They make their audits in different parts of the world and we have to prove that we are complying with the WHO code and up to now we can prove that in everything we are.&quot;</P><P>Brabeck was in Davos to chair the council meeting of the 2030 Water Resources Group (WRG), a cross-sector collaboration of business, government and civil society, which is seeking to find practical solutions to the crisis of water scarcity.</P><P>The success of early initiatives in countries such as South Africa and has led to a stream of governments approaching the WRG for advice and support, including Bangladesh, Kenya, Lebanon, Colombia, Panama and Lebanon.</P><P>Brabeck told me the issue of water has shot up the global political agenda because it is no longer a problem only of the future as many countries are already struggling to meet the demands of a growing population and an expanding economy.</P><P>&quot;I have never seen so many presidents and ministers being interested to talk about water because they are constantly being confronted by the issue in their daily decisions,&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;The water issue is so complex that frankly speaking nobody can handle that alone. The food and energy safety of a country, as well as the wellbeing of its people depend on water.</P><P>&quot;In most cases in government, the responsibility for water is split between 20 and 28 different ministers and agencies. So it needs to have a co-ordinated approach and the way the 2030 Water Resources Group can help is to establish a local private/public partnership which is coordinating all efforts to find and to elaborate a <mark>sustainable</mark> water strategy.&quot;</P><P>This is no easy matter, given so many organisations have their own individual initiatives, and there is a &quot;natural human response to prefer to be the head of a mouse than the tail of an elephant&quot;.</P><P><STRONG>Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

As part of these Frameworks in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, the chocolate and cocoa industry will put in place verifiable monitoring systems for traceability from farm to the first purchase point for their own purchases of cocoa. The industry will also work with the governments of Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana to ensure an effective national framework for traceability for all traders in the supply chain.“Ferrero is committed to working on the challenges to end deforestation in the cocoa sector, as well as implement key principles and strategies that underpin socially and environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark> cocoa production” said Aldo Uva, Open <mark>Innovation</mark> and Chief Operation Officer Strategic Business Units of the Ferrero Group.This latest commitment is an important milestone for Ferrero and evidence of its dedication to a <mark>sustainable</mark> and responsible cocoa supply chain. It follows the signing of the New York Declaration on Forests by the United Nations, which Ferrero committed to in 2014, and the <A href=""https://www.ferrero.com/group-news/Ferrero%E2%80%99s-dedication-to-a-deforestation-free-Global-Cocoa-Supply-Chain"" target=""_blank"">Cocoa and Forests Initiative</A> in March 2017.At the same time, Ferrero remains dedicated to its ongoing work to map 100% of its cocoa supply chain to farm-gate level, as well as its partnerships to improve the livelihood of farmers and their communities with partners like Save the Children and Fairtrade &amp; Cooperative Union ECOOKIM.As part of its Corporate Social Responsibility strategy, Ferrero continues to engage in certification programmes, institutional engagement and projects and partnerships, with the aim to safeguard the future of the cocoa sector, supporting and improving cocoa farming sustainability.</P></DIV><DIV class=""atext""><P>Ferrero signs Frameworks for Action to end deforestation and restore forest areas in cocoa...</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""item-news"" id=""id-2530""><DIV class=""wrapper abstract"" id=""2530""><P class=""date"">31-08-2017</P><P class=""title"">Ferrero’s seventh palm oil progress report</P><DIV class=""text"" style=""display: none !important""><P><STRONG>Traceability</STRONG>Ferrero’s palm oil supplies come from 100% RSPO certified and segregated oil, whilst our <A href=""https://www.ferrerocsr.com/news/Ferrero-Palm-Oil-Charter"" target=""_blank"">Ferrero Palm Oil Charter</A> demonstrates our commitment to take our supply chain beyond RSPO requirements. A key factor in doing this is our continuing work in maintaining robust traceability, which allows us to understand the origins of our supply. This information means we can work more efficiently with suppliers.In 2016 Ferrero faced several challenges regarding its major suppliers' efforts towards good practices and maintaining the RSPO certification. In fact, despite the long term cooperation with suppliers, and our constant commitment to lasting partnerships with them, the dynamics in the palm industry in 2016 compelled us to look at new suppliers, thus altering our supply chain.However, we continued to invest in 100% SG certified palm oil and maintain full traceability even during the shortage periods of some SG certified palm oil products. Furthermore, this alteration provided us with the opportunity to engage, learn and at the same time elevate the practices on the ground.  This also enabled us to ensure that the new suppliers fully acknowledge and endorse the Ferrero Palm Oil Charter, whilst more established suppliers align with it.<STRONG>Supplier Engagement </STRONG>We understand our suppliers play a crucial role in supporting our journey in sustainability. Without their support, we would not be able to offer consumers our high quality and fresh products. As a result, we place a lot of importance on our supplier engagements.Besides regular interactions at events such as the RSPO Round Table, we also meet our suppliers and continuously engage with them to ensure the implementation of our Palm Oil Charter in line with our roadmap. <STRONG>Supplier Assessment</STRONG>In order to establish an in-depth discussion with our supplier we piloted a self-assessment questionnaire to selected suppliers in January.  Through the feedback from the pilot assessments, we were able to identify the supplier’s status on social and environmental topics, key challenges they are facing on the ground and various gaps compared to the Ferrero Charter.  By the end of 2017 we will roll out the assessment to all our suppliers. Findings from the assessments will then be the focus of future discussions. <STRONG>Field Visits</STRONG>In May 2017, the Ferrero team, together with our sustainability partner, TFT, visited key suppliers in Malaysia and Indonesia. The purpose of this trip was to firstly discuss the findings from the pilot self-assessments and to secondly experience first-hand the practices that are being undertaken by the suppliers in terms of managing labor and environment related issues. These field visits provided essential information to the development of individual roadmaps for our suppliers in order to fulfil the Ferrero Palm Oil Charter requirements.<STRONG>No Exploitation</STRONG>The three-way discussions carried out between Ferrero, TFT, and our suppliers during the field visit were tailored to the self- assessments and suppliers’ challenges and gaps identified in comparison with the Ferrero Charter. These discussions provided Ferrero and TFT with the opportunity to develop a clear roadmap essentially oriented around labor related matters, as well as to define solutions to improve the shortcomings. These tailor-made roadmaps will be systematically shared and discussed with our suppliers, and will constitute a key part of our Palm Oil Charter implementation framework. Accordingly, our Verification Protocol will serve as the basis for the assessment carried out by our auditing partner Bureau Veritas. <STRONG>No Deforestation</STRONG>Ferrero is continuously committed to finding innovative solutions that support our efforts towards a more <mark>sustainable</mark> development. With this in mind, whilst building on our grower level traceability achievement, Ferrero started piloting a geospatial assessment to monitor forest cover change by using a combination of different remote sensing technologies on selected plantations of our supply chain.  The service called Starling has been developed through a partnership between Airbus Defence and Space, The Forest Trust (TFT) and SarVision. It is able to provide real time updates on deforestation in the areas identified for monitoring. Following positive results of the testing phase, in May 2017 Ferrero embarked on Phase 2 of this project. The service is used in selected priority areas based on land cover within and around the sourcing concessions as well as on the importance of the supplying parent company to Ferrero. We are confident this could be the start of a successful journey in verifying the implementation our No Deforestation commitment within our palm oil supply chain.  </P></DIV><DIV class=""atext""><P>Ferrero’s palm oil supplies come from 100% RSPO certified and segregated oil, whilst our Ferrero Palm Oil Charter...</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""item-news"" id=""id-2491""><DIV class=""wrapper abstract"" id=""2491""><P class=""date"">28-08-2017</P><P class=""title"">Forest City New York Announces Ferrero International to Join The Bridge at Cornell Tech</P><DIV class=""text"" style=""display: none !important""><P>NEW YORK - Forest City New York today announced that Ferrero International S.A., the Italian confectionary group and one of the world’s largest manufacturers of chocolates, will take space at The Bridge at Cornell Tech.

In light of these supply changes, we had to revise and even restart activities aimed at full traceability previously achieved in December 2015. However, we are pleased to confirm that between January – June 2016 Ferrero reached 100% traceability of its palm oil sources to 86 mills and 98.5% traceability to 447 plantations. In total we have about 36,500 smallholders in our supply chain. Ferrero sources its palm oil supplies accordingly: Malaysia (92.46% of our certified RSPO Segregated volumes), Papua New Guinea (5.97%), Brazil (0.64%), Indonesia (0.51%), Costa Rica (0.15%); Colombia (0.09%), Guatemala (0.09%); Salomon Islands (0.05%), Honduras (0.04%). <U>No deforestation: update</U>The achieved traceability means that by the end of 2016, we have been able to identify the name, ownership and the location of the supplying plantations, including coordinates. Furthermore, we have systematically started collecting the maps of plantations, where data was available from official sources.  High level of traceability is key to verify the implementation of the Palm Oil Charter and embedded POIG requirements. In October 2016, Ferrero started a pilot project called “Starling”, in order to test remote sensing technologies for monitoring forest cover change. Starling is a new service developed by a consortium between Airbus Defence and Space, The Forest Trust (TFT) and SarVision.  Remote sensing technologies available today are able to differentiate between replanting and deforestation. Satellite and radar images taken in near-real time at regular intervals can be used to monitor land use change over a given time. It is anticipated for the long-term that geospatial assessments like Starling can provide a credible tool to check if suppliers comply with Ferrero’s no-deforestation principles. In April 2015, Ferrero endorsed the HCS Approach (HCSA), a methodology launched by a large platform of stakeholders enabling companies to understand forest areas for protection from degraded lands with low <mark>carbon</mark> and biodiversity values that may be developed.  In this context, Ferrero welcomes the agreement reached in November 2016 on the <STRONG><A href=""http://high<mark>carbon</mark>stock.org/agreement-on-unified-approach-to-implementing-no-deforestation-commitments/"" target=""_blank"">convergence</A></STRONG> between the HCSA and HCS+ approaches “<EM>on a single, coherent set of principles for implementation of companies’ commitments to “no deforestation” in their palm oil operations and supply chains</EM>”. The revised HCSA toolkit, available in early 2017, will give indications on how to delink deforestation from the palm oil production. <U>No exploitation: update</U>In order to provide our suppliers with effective guidelines to comply with the ‘no exploitation’ requirements of the Ferrero Charter, in April 2016 Ferrero endorsed the &quot;<EM><STRONG><A href=""https://www.humanityunited.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PalmOilPrinciples_031215.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Free and Fair Labor in Palm Oil Production: Principles and Implementation Guidance</A></STRONG></EM>“. The document was released in March 2015 by a wide alliance of international human rights and environmental organizations gathering around a common platform as it pertains to fair labor working conditions.  In November 2016 this document then led to the launch of the POIG Publication “<EM>Palm Oil <mark>innovation</mark>s: Labour Rights</EM>”, which Ferrero, as a POIG member, integrated into its Charter. The document outlines how to ensure that the rights of workers are respected by palm oil growers. It also advises the RSPO on how to reinforce its current Principles &amp; Criteria on this topic in the upcoming review. <U>Next steps</U>• Visiting priority plantations: with the availability of the new traceability data, we have completed the desktop assessment of suppliers, identifying their status on social and environmental topics, any gaps compared to the Charter and the recommended action plans for them. This assessment enables us to identify the priority plantations to visit in first half 2017 in order to discuss and improve their activities.• Third party verification.• After the completion of these visits, we will be able to start running the third party verification process according to the “Ferrero Verification Protocol” with the support of a leading, external service provider. It will help determine if our suppliers are effectively meeting the Ferrero Palm Oil Charter requirements to protect forests, biodiversity, local communities and workers’ rights.• The Ferrero Palm Oil Dashboard: traceability data, progress with our suppliers, maps and assessments will be assembled to create the “Ferrero Palm Oil Dashboard”, as part of our journey towards transparency.</P></DIV><DIV class=""atext""><P>In 2016 Ferrero chose to modify its palm oil supply base</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""item-news"" id=""id-2201""><DIV class=""wrapper abstract"" id=""2201""><P class=""date"">10-12-2016</P><P class=""title"">Ferrero’s position on child labour within the cocoa supply chain</P><DIV class=""text"" style=""display: none !important""><P>Ferrero has a “Zero tolerance approach” towards child labour and is committed to protect children’s rights all along its supply chain, as stated in its Code of Business Conduct.  Ferrero has always been fully committed to fighting against child labor, with the conviction that every child should be protected, by all possible means, from economic exploitation, which is an abominable phenomenon.   Ferrero suppliers are contractually required to comply with the Ferrero’s Code of Business Conduct. If cases of child labor are reported, as recently happened, the contract is automatically terminated and the case reported to the appropriate authorities.   Ferrero’s Code of Business Conduct is coherent with the principles of the ILO’s Minimum Age Convention No. 138 and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention No. 182.   Moreover, Ferrero already strongly supports the protection of the rights of children all over the world, through the objectives indicated in the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, to which the Ferrero Group has officially adhered.  Ferrero’s Code of Business Conduct is available at <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ferrero.com/social-responsibility/code-business-conduct"">www.ferrero.com/social-responsibility/code-business-conduct</A>.  <STRONG>Certifications and Standards  </STRONG>Currently, the Group is working with the following certification standards:  UTZ, Rainforest Alliance Certified™ and Fairtrade.  UTZ certification means <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture and better opportunities for farmers, their families and the planet. The UTZ program enhances farmers’ knowledge of good agricultural practices, improves working con-ditions and ensure they care for their children and the environment. Through UTZ, farmers grow better crops and enjoy a higher income, which creates better opportunities for them and their families, preserves the environment and protects the earth’s natural resources.  Rainforest Alliance Certified™ farms support a healthy environment, promote the well-being of workers and their communities and ensure efficient farming methods. Farm workers benefit from safe working conditions and housing, medical care and access to schools for their children. Certification helps ensure the protection of ecosystems, including wildlife habitats, water and soil.  The Fairtrade Cocoa Program enables small-scale farmers to benefit by selling more of their cocoa as Fairtrade. For more info, visit <A href=""http://www.info.fairtrade.net/program"">www.info.fairtrade.net/program</A>. Within the Fairtrade Sourcing Program terms, in 2016 Ferrero decided to double the amount of cocoa it purchases from Fairtrade farmers – to 40,000 metric tonnes over the next three years.       Moreover, <STRONG>Ferrero collaborates with non-profit and farmer organizations</STRONG> to address agricultural, social, environmental and business issues in cocoa farming. Ferrero also supports ongoing local projects to ensure <mark>sustainable</mark> cocoa production, whilst improving cocoa farmers’ living conditions and the well-being of their communities. Following are some examples of these on-the-ground projects.     <STRONG>Elimination of child labour through Projects and Partnerships </STRONG>- <STRONG>Save the Children partnership: </STRONG>aimed at the protection and education of child labour victims on cocoa farms in the south-west of the Ivory Coast, by enhancing alternative educational pathways to child labor. - <STRONG>Ferrero Fairtrade and Cooperative Union ECOOKIM Joint-Monitoring Programme:  </STRONG>sourcing Fairtrade certified and <mark>sustainable</mark> cocoa from ECOOKIM in the Ivory Coast, with the aim to support further social and <mark>sustainable</mark> development of the cocoa farming communities and improve their well-being. - <STRONG>Fairtrade Child Labour Prevention Programme “It takes a Village to Protect a Child”:</STRONG>Supplier ECOOKIM’s engaged in programme to prevent child labour in cocoa communities and promote the well-being of children, through the establishment of a Child Labour committee to conduct awareness-raising activities, develop a child protection policy as well as improve child education. - <STRONG>Ferrero Cocoa Community Commitment (F3C): </STRONG>to improve the livelihoods and well-being of cocoa farming families in Ghana, through the reduction of the worst forms of child labour and the increase in household income. - <STRONG>Nigeria Kokodola Project: </STRONG>aimed at improving the livelihood of cocoa farmers in western Nigeria, through technical training on best agricultural cocoa practices as well as awareness-raising activities on social issues such as child labour, to address and eliminate them.     <STRONG>Institutional and Collective Engagement  </STRONG>Furthermore Ferrero is a partner of collective public/private platforms, such as the International Cocoa Initiative (ICI) and the World Cocoa Foundation’s “Cocoa Action” Strategy, whose interventions seek to reduce the occurrence of farm-level practices that have in the past involved the use of children.  Ferrero believes that Cocoa Action’s strength lies in combining community development and farmer productivity with the intention of raising farm-level incomes, an approach that should see change in cocoa-growing communities and a reduction in the use of child labor in West Africa.

The document describes improvements that can be put into practice by palm oil growers and the RSPO to reinforce its current Principles &amp; Criteria on the workers’ right. Key recommendations include- Paying a decent living wage, as agreed through the participation of workers and independent unions;- No fees or costs are charged to workers, directly or indirectly, for recruitment or employment services;- No retention of passports, other government issued identification and any personal valuables;- Limiting precarious work by ensuring that casual, temporary and day labour is limited to jobs that are genuinely temporary or seasonal, and account for no more than 20% of the workforce;- Providing access to accessible, equitable and legitimate grievance mechanisms.In 2013, Ferrero launched its <A href=""https://www.ferrero.com/group-news/Ferrero-Palm-Oil-Charter"" target=""_blank"">Palm Oil Charter</A> to also address the possible violations of labour rights in the plantations it supplies from.

The company is strongly committed to sustainability and is convinced that dedication from suppliers is key to achieving <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chains. As part of its responsible sourcing practices, Ferrero decided to implement a simple process to monitor and rate the environmental, social, and ethical performance of suppliers through the EcoVadis Supplier Sustainability Assessment Platform. The methodology covers 21 criteria across four main themes: environment, social, fair business, and <mark>sustainable</mark> procurement practices. They are based upon internationally recognized standards and are in line with Ferrero’s Code of Business Conduct and Code of Ethics. The EcoVadis Solution allows Ferrero to better understand and monitor risks in its supply chains, while identifying best supplier practices and improvement potentials. The reliable rating platform also provides suppliers with a detailed analysis of their performance, allowing them to benchmark their position against sectorial practices and to manage their corrective actions effectively. The key objective of monitoring suppliers’ sustainability performance is to verify excellence in their activities and, where necessary, leverage on the influence of Ferrero’s supply chains to encourage a better performance. Based on a collaborative approach, the company aims at promoting best practices and fostering long-term relationships with suppliers through engagement. A pilot assessment project covering approximately 60 strategic suppliers was completed in mid-2016. After its success, Ferrero confirms its commitment to adopt the EcoVadis Assessment Model as the tool to assess and improve its suppliers’ sustainability performance. “All stakeholders along the value chain must work together to achieve <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain. One of Ferrero’s approaches to <mark>sustainable</mark> sourcing practices is strengthening collective engagement with suppliers. Therefore, it is essential to collaborate joint efforts with suppliers to be successful in achieving our commitments. Embedding EcoVadis Supplier Assessment Methodology in our approach helps us to assess and improve environmental, social and ethical performances across the supply chains, while establishing a platform to share best practices,” said Aldo Cristiano, Sustainability Director at Ferrero. &quot;Ferrero's <mark>sustainable</mark> procurement initiative is off to a great start with a 67% participation rate from direct commodity suppliers &quot; said Pierre-Francois Thaler, Co-CEO of EcoVadis.  &quot;We strive to help Ferrero combine EcoVadis ratings with their proactive collaboration with suppliers to improve performance across all corporate social responsibility topics, and drive positive change in the communities from which they source.&quot;</P></DIV><DIV class=""atext""><P>Ferrero and EcoVadis announced the renewal of their partnership over the next three years</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""item-news"" id=""id-2080""><DIV class=""wrapper abstract"" id=""2080""><P class=""date"">21-09-2016</P><P class=""title"">Ferrero leads the 2016 WWF Palm Oil Scorecard</P><DIV class=""text"" style=""display: none !important""><P>On 21st September, the <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?278673/WWF-Scorecard-shows-which-companies-kept-their-promises-to-consumers-on-palm-oil"">WWF International Palm Oil Scorecard 2016</A> was published and has placed the <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://palmoilscorecard.panda.org/check-the-scores/manufacturers/ferrero"">Ferrero Group as a top scorer</A> among 137 global companies, which were all assessed according to their sustainability actions in the palm oil sector during 2015.  Specifically, in recent months WWF has analyzed companies in Europe, North America, Australia and Japan to understand their progress on the certification of palm oil as well as on key actions to ensure a responsible use of palm oil.Through this survey, Ferrero has obtained a score of 9 points out of 9 and has been labelled as ‘Leading the way’ to the ultimate sustainability goal for the industry – that certified <mark>sustainable</mark> palm oil becomes the standard commodity grade for all companies. This result derives from having met our certification objective in January 2015, ensuring that the final product physically contains 100% RSPO Segregated palm oil, as well as from its additional sustainability actions. Indeed, in line with our consumers’ and employees’ values and expectations, in 2013 we launched the Ferrero Palm Oil Charter listing the key single topics to be managed, in order to secure a <mark>sustainable</mark> palm oil supply chain.  Since then, Ferrero’s partnership with TFT has been allowing us to turn our commitments into grounded actions, such as conducting field visits in the plantations we source from. Key to this progress is the continuous dialogue and engagement of our suppliers throughout the journey. Ferrero is committed to engage and support its suppliers to develop, implement and follow-up a pragmatic and long-term action plan in order to address the Charter requirements in their own and third party estates. The next step will involve third party verification of the implementation of the Charter requirements. Furthermore, Ferrero’s membership with the POIG in November 2015 represented a further step to carry out its sustainability commitments and actions on a credible and innovative platform. Ferrero shares the POIG’s vision to “break the link between palm oil and deforestation, and human, land and labor rights violations.”(<A target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.poig.org"">www.poig.org</A>), and in line with this vision, we proceeded by supporting the HCS Approach and the &quot;Free and Fair Labor in Palm Oil Production: Principles and Implementation Guidance&quot;. Endorsed respectively in April 2015 and April 2016, both of these toolkits provide practical guidance for our suppliers in addressing our ‘no deforestation-no exploitation’ Charter requirements. Finally, the result achieved in the WWF Scorecard is relevant to us because it underpins the importance of our journey towards responsible palm oil, further fueling our determination to succeed and renew our commitment in this direction.We at Ferrero are celebrating our 70th Anniversary. It goes without saying that this result is embedded in the strong legacy and values coming from Ferrero’s inherent commitment to be a responsible player in the global market. <STRONG>What are the Ferrero milestones towards responsible palm oil?</STRONG>2005 – January- Ferrero <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.rspo.org/members/96/Ferrero-Trading-Lux-S.A"">becomes</A> RSPO (Roundtable on <mark>Sustainable</mark> Palm Oil) member2013 – November – Ferrero <A target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ferrero.com/group-news/Ferrero-Palm-Oil-Charter"">launches</A> the Palm Oil Charter and becomes a member of The Forest Trust.2014 – May - Ferrero publishes its first progresses’ <A target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ferrero.com/group-news/Ferrero-responsible-palm-oil-progress-update/"">report</A> about the Charter’s implementation 2014 – November – Ferrero <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://poig.org/leading-manufacturers-and-retailers-announce-support-for-palm-oil-<mark>innovation</mark>-group/"">becomes</A> Palm Oil <mark>Innovation</mark> Group (POIG) supporter. 2014 – November –Ferrero <A target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ferrero.com/group-news/Ferrero-palm-oil-progress-report---November-2014"">acknowledges</A> some remaining issues in the plantations it sources from and agree on action plan with its suppliers. 2015 – January – all Ferrero products worldwide are <A target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ferrero.com/group-news/ONLY-<mark>SUSTAINABLE</mark>-TRACEABLE-CERTIFIED-PALM-OIL-FOR-FERRERO"">RSPO certified under the Segregated</A> supply chain – which means that they physically contain <mark>sustainable</mark> palm oil from certified.2015 – April – Ferrero <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/seasia/Press-Centre/Press-Releases/High-<mark>Carbon</mark>-Stock-Toolkit/"">endorses</A> the High <mark>Carbon</mark> Stock (HCS) Approach the toolkit on how to identify tropical forests for conservation and degraded lands for potential plantation development.2015 – October – Ferrero knows the mills and related plantations of origin for 99.5 % of the palm oil products it buys.2015 – November – Ferrero <A href=""https://www.ferrero.com/group-news/Ferrero-joins-NGOs-and-innovative-palm-oil-suppliers-becoming-POIG-member/"">becomes</A> Palm Oil <mark>Innovation</mark> Group (POIG) member. </P></DIV><DIV class=""atext""><P>The WWF International Palm Oil Scorecard 2016 has placed the Ferrero Group as a top scorer among 137 global companies</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""item-news"" id=""id-2044""><DIV class=""wrapper abstract"" id=""2044""><P class=""date"">29-07-2016</P><P class=""title"">Ferrero’s fifth palm oil progress report</P><DIV class=""text"" style=""display: none !important""><P>Ferrero has always given the utmost importance to offering consumers products of the highest quality, freshness and food safety.What’s more, our products contain carefully selected raw materials that respect both people and planet.This is why in 2013 we launched the Ferrero Charter listing the key single topics to be managed, in order to secure a responsible palm oil supply chain. In line with our consumers’ and employees’  values and expectations, this step was then followed by the  certification of 100% of the palm oil contained in our products worldwide. This was achieved in January 2015 according to the RSPO Segregated supply chain. However our engagement did not stop here. Aware of the responsibility that comes with having leading global Brands, we are committed to leveraging this position to transform and innovate the palm oil industry. Within this context, Ferrero’s membership with the POIG in November 2015  represented a natural step to carry out our commitments and actions on a credible and innovative platform. We, at Ferrero, share the POIG’s vision to “break the link between palm oil and deforestation, and human, land and labour rights violations.”(www.poig.org). In line with this vision we support the HCS Approach and the &quot;Free and Fair Labor in Palm Oil Production: Principles and Implementation Guidance&quot;. Endorsed respectively in April 2015 and April 2016, both of these toolkits provide practical guidance for our suppliers in addressing our ‘no deforestation-no exploitation’ Charter requirements. Since 2013, the partnership with TFT allows us to turn our commitments into grounded actions, such as conducting field visits in the plantations we source from. Key to this progress is the continuous dialogue and engagement of our suppliers throughout the journey.  In December 2015 Ferrero achieved 99.5% traceability to the plantations, with TFT’s support. Specifically, we recorded 63 mills and 301 plantations. It has proved to be an extremely powerful tool because it enables us to determine the status of our action plan. In fact, by identifying the specific plantations we can monitor how our suppliers are implementing our requests and then engage them in improvement actions when gaps are detected. However, this traceability achievement was threatened by the recent developments that have compelled Ferrero to largely revise its supply chain.  Ferrero indeed requires its suppliers to act consistently in a <mark>sustainable</mark> manner. Even if unrelated to its supply chain, Ferrero considers it unacceptable if any supplier faces documented complaints, in contradiction with the values reflected in our Palm Oil Charter.  Suppliers unprepared to engage or address compliance issues will be cut out of Ferrero’s supply chain. They have to provide evidence of change through concrete actions to be reconsidered.  Ferrero has been managing this since early 2016, resulting in the suspension of its suppliers accounting for nearly 50% of its total palm oil volumes.  This meant that Ferrero has had to drastically modify its sourcing strategy to continue to ensure 100% RSPO certified Segregated palm oil, supplying more from existing, reliable suppliers and from new ones. As the procurement situation gradually regains consistency, we will be updating the latest figures on traceability as soon as possible. The new full list of plantations we source from will allow us to continue in verifying the suppliers’ compliance with our Charter requirements.

Pumpkins are a Goldilocks vegetable, needing moist (but not sodden) soil and frost-free conditions. Those in Morton are close to perfect. In 2016, an acre of Illinois land could produce about 41,000 pounds (19 metric tons) of <A href=""https://www.verybestbaking.com/libbys/we-are-pumpkin"" data-web-url=""https://www.verybestbaking.com/libbys/we-are-pumpkin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">pumpkin</A>, more than twice as much as most other major producing states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</P><P>Vegetables travel much better once processed and canned, so putting a factory in the middle of that pumpkin belt is by far the best way of ensuring kitchens across the country can get their supply of mashed starch.</P><P>There's a problem with this model, though: If unusual weather conditions cause yields to decline in Morton alone, the entire national crop of canned pumpkin can fail. Too much rain in the spring planting season means seeds don't get sown. Too little in the growing season, and they fail to thrive. Too much come the harvest, and tractors get bogged down while gourds are left to rot in the fields. As Thanksgiving cooks may remember, the wet autumns of 2009 and 2015 resulted in such shortages that at one point cans of Libby's pumpkin were <A href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/01/AR2010060100801.html"" title=""Amid pumpkin shortage, growers hope for a dryer summer"" data-web-url=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/01/AR2010060100801.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">selling for $30 on eBay</A>.</P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> is likely to exacerbate this trend, as <A title=""What does <mark>climate change</mark> have to do with pumpkin pie?"" href=""https://medium.com/nestle-usa/what-does-<mark>climate</mark>-change-have-to-do-with-pumpkin-pie-1665eabed358"" data-web-url=""https://medium.com/nestle-usa/what-does-<mark>climate</mark>-change-have-to-do-with-pumpkin-pie-1665eabed358"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Nestle itself has warned</A>. Central Illinois already gets about <A href=""https://www.<mark>climate</mark>.gov/news-features/<mark>climate</mark>-and/<mark>climate</mark>-pumpkins"" title=""<mark>Climate</mark>.gov -- <mark>Climate</mark> &amp; Pumpkins"" data-web-url=""https://www.<mark>climate</mark>.gov/news-features/<mark>climate</mark>-and/<mark>climate</mark>-pumpkins"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">two inches more early spring rainfall</A> than it did a century ago <A href=""http://www.pjstar.com/article/20150924/BUSINESS/150929624"" title=""Extra: Libby’s, the world’s largest pumpkin factory, calls Morton home"" data-web-url=""http://www.pjstar.com/article/20150924/BUSINESS/150929624"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">when the Libby's factory was built</A>, and that shift to wetter conditions with more intense downpours will probably be exacerbated over the coming decades.

It's notable in the chart above that, barring the bumper years of 2014 and 2016, Illinois pumpkin yields have been declining for a decade.</P><P>Pie is the least of the worries in this process. Illinois is the biggest producer of soybeans in the U.S. and the second-biggest of corn, and the wider midwestern breadbasket plays a crucial role in food supply worldwide. More than a third of each crop globally is grown in the U.S., according to Department of Agriculture data.

He also chairs the environmental sustainability committee of FoodDrinkEurope, an industry trade group. He spoke to EURACTIV’s publisher and editor, Frédéric Simon.</EM></P><P><STRONG>The COP21 opens in Paris in a just a few days. The food and drink processing industry in Europe comes there with a strong track record, since it was able to reduce its <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by 22% over the past decade. In which areas were the biggest cuts achieved? </STRONG></P><P>These reductions come a lot from processing: improvements in energy efficiency and a move towards cleaner fuels — replacing for instance coal and heavy fuels with gas — which reduces significantly the emission of greenhouse gases.</P><P>We’ve also started a switch to renewable fuels. For example, at Nestlé in France, we have just installed three new boilers using wood — coming from sustainably managed forests —replacing heavy fuel boilers. So this is how we started a shift to renewable energies in our manufacturing plants in France.</P><P>Another important element is the use of natural refrigerants. There is a commitment through the <A href=""http://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/"">consumer goods forum</A>, which is a global organisation involving many food companies and retailers, to use natural refrigerants instead of HFCs ? whether ammonia, <mark>CO2</mark> or hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s. And so there is a commitment from this forum to phase out HFCs, which have a significant global warming potential.</P><P><STRONG>So renewable energies and refrigerants are the two areas where the biggest cuts were achieved over the past decade?</STRONG></P><P>We can mention a third one, which is food waste. There is an effort by industry to eliminate waste. Worldwide, 30% of food is wasted. And the issue is not only about treating waste but also saving energy, water, greenhouse gas emissions which were generated to produce this waste.</P><P>So by moving to reduce food waste along the value chain ? in manufacturing but also in retail and with our suppliers ? there is certainly a benefit in terms of greenhouse gas reduction without affecting the output, which is a win-win solution.</P><P><STRONG>Is this waste being reused in the manufacturing process?</STRONG></P><P>The first thing is to prevent waste from happening in the first place. The ultimate objective of any food and drink company is to become zero-waste. And at Nestlé, we made a commitment that by 2020, all our sites will be zero-waste-to-landfill. We are already there in the UK and in Europe generally speaking we are well advanced. And we are not alone, other companies are doing this too.</P><P>So the first priority is to prevent waste by improving our processes, with better planning, so that everything that is produced is sold or used. Now, if waste happens to be generated, then instead of being landfilled, the waste can be reprocessed as an intermediary product ? if quality criteria are met of course. Otherwise, it can be re-used for pig farming as animal feed or ultimately for land spreading ? again provided that quality criteria are respected.</P><P><STRONG>Looking ahead, where do you see the biggest potential for further cuts being made in the next 10-20 years?</STRONG></P><P>I would see the biggest potential in the upstream supply chain, which is not necessarily in Europe.</P><P>Many food companies, including Nestlé, have taken a commitment to zero-deforestation, for instance. And also to cut food waste in the upstream supply chain. So that means helping our suppliers inside and outside of Europe to improve their efficiency and prevent food losses in the supply chain, which can be significant.</P><P><STRONG>You mean losses happening at the farm, essentially?</STRONG></P><P>Yes, exactly. And not only in Europe, which is not the most critical, although the Commission does not have clear figure at this stage. The FAO has identified losses in the supply chain in many countries of the world due to lack of storage capacity, lack of proper transportation means, etc.</P><P>So there are losses after harvest but ? even worse ? sometimes before harvest. This means there is underperforming agriculture in many countries. And at Nestlé, we have more than 1,000 agronomists in the field helping our suppliers in areas like dairy, cocoa and coffee. Nestlé doesn’t own any farms but our technicians help farmers directly in the field to improve their efficiency, improve their yields and implementing <mark>sustainable</mark> farming practices. We have the Nescafé plan and the Cocoa plan which are exactly for that purpose. We even provide them with tree plantation help.</P><P>So that’s the future: going towards no deforestation for which there are commitments. But it’s not sufficient — there is a need to have the governments involved, and also smaller companies.</P><P><STRONG>Are these programmes with suppliers just embryonic, or are they becoming more widespread across the industry? </STRONG></P><P>It depends on the companies. Some have been working on it for a long time and I would certainly put Nestlé in that group.</P><P><STRONG>But is it mainly the bigger companies doing it?</STRONG></P><P>Not all of them. At Nestlé, we’ve been doing it for a number of years — sending our agronomists to the fields in order to improve farming practices. We have always made sure to maintain a contact with farmers for example in our dairy business. More than half of the milk we procure is procured directly from farmers because a majority of our factories are located in the production countries. Same for coffee — between 15 and 20% of the coffee we procure is directly from growers. That allows us as well to have a direct contact with them.</P><P>Other companies also have programmes, on cocoa in Africa, for instance. Because we are all facing risks of having supply challenges, which are exacerbated by <mark>climate change</mark>. The demand is booming, so it is a business challenge.</P><P>When we look at the survey made by FoodDrinkEurope, <A href=""http://www.fooddrinkeurope.eu/uploads/publications_documents/FoodDrink_Europe_<mark>Climate</mark>_Action_Brochure.pdf"">Time to Act</A>, food companies are already working with farmers. 90% said they already work actively to reduce emissions along the food chain by working with farmers. In Europe, this is mostly the biggest companies doing this for the time being.</P><P><STRONG>I saw Nestlé has been running a </STRONG><A href=""http://www.nestle.com/csv/rural-development-responsible-sourcing/responsible-sourcing""><STRONG>supply chain management programme,</STRONG></A><STRONG> which includes auditing thousands of suppliers in all kinds of product categories. How much is this costing to Nestlé, and how do you justify those costs to investors and shareholders? </STRONG></P><P>There is a clear risk identified for sustainability of supply. So it’s our responsibility towards our shareholders to identify and address this risk.</P><P><STRONG>But the costs must be high, I suppose?</STRONG></P><P>This is part of the operating cost. We are a long-term oriented company, we are going to celebrate next year our 150th anniversary and we have to anticipate potential risks affecting the future of the company. And one of them is sourcing of quality raw materials — especially coffee, cocoa and dairy because the demand is booming.</P><P>And maybe auditing is not the proper word to use in this case. It’s not about assessing whether farmers are passing or failing a test. It’s more about seeing whether our <mark>sustainable</mark> sourcing guidelines are properly implemented in the twelve different categories that we have identified.</P><P>So the purpose of this audit is not to select suppliers and stop doing business with those who fail but making sure they apply our requirements. And when we find it’s not the case, helping them to achieve these performance levels.</P><P>After a certain time, if they still don’t satisfy our requirements, we will have to stop doing business and look somewhere else. But our purpose is to help, especially smallholders, to improve their performance levels so that they can stay in business.</P><P>In the same way, all our own factories, distribution centres and head offices are certified — ISO 9000, ISO 14000, etc. All this has a cost of course but it also has a return which is an improved performance of our operations and our suppliers.</P><P><STRONG>With those suppliers that don’t meet the requirements, what timeframe do you give yourself to bring them in line or stop doing business with them? Is it five or ten years?</STRONG></P><P>It’s certainly not ten years! We audit and come back to them after one year at the latest. And if they’re not there, we challenge them. Fortunately it doesn’t happen so often because they realise it’s in their interest, not only to continue supply Nestlé but also others.</P><P>We don’t do that to bother them. Our ambition is to help them understand potential risks like the evolution of the <mark>climate</mark>. Some farmers in coffee or cocoa or maybe a dairy farmer in Pakistan or India may not have the same access to information we have. So we share this information with them hoping they will understand it’s in their best interest to adopt <mark>sustainable</mark> farming practices, not only in the interest of Nestlé. And generally, they understand.</P><P><STRONG>Looking at the Nestlé website, I saw you had a </STRONG><A href=""http://www.<mark>sustainable</mark>brands.com/news_and_views/supply_chain/hannah_ritchie/nestle_tata_setting_bar_100_<mark>sustainable</mark>_sourcing""><STRONG>target for 100% <mark>sustainable</mark> sourcing of cocoa</STRONG></A><STRONG> by the end of 2015. We’re approaching the end of the year, so can you say you are on track? </STRONG></P><P>We will see. We cannot tell you anything now.</P><P><STRONG>What is Nestlé going to do next? Are you going to adopt similar 100% sourcing targets in other areas?</STRONG></P><P>Certainly, but we have not decided yet. Our objectives have been published, and they are the only ones which are publicly available.</P><P><STRONG>Looking ahead, is 100% certified sourcing a target the industry should be aiming for generally?</STRONG></P><P>It depends how. It’s not just about certification, because there is evidence that certification eliminates mainly smallholders. So it’s not only about getting a certificate. It’s about creating awareness among farmers of the potential challenges they will be confronted with, and helping them address them.</P><P><STRONG>So you’re saying certification could even be counterproductive, by imposing bureaucratic requirements on smallholders?</STRONG></P><P>If it’s just certification, definitely. Now, the more assistance smallholders and SMEs will receive from companies or public services or traders, the better it is. But it has to be real assistance, not just delisting smallholders who are not compliant. This won’t help.</P><P>In Columbia, for instance, the production of coffee is challenged, partly because of El Niño. And the younger generation is no longer interested in working in the farm. It’s the same in Europe and Africa. The younger generation wants to live in the cities. So who’s going to work in the farm of tomorrow?</P><P><STRONG>Looking down the supply chain, what steps is the industry taking to reduce its environmental footprint?</STRONG></P><P>Downstream, we can encourage and guide consumers but we don’t have the same kind of influence as with the suppliers.</P><P>First, we provide information to consumers because they have a key role to play in this area. Several years ago, we identified there was a plethora of environmental labels. We drew these conclusions as part of the <A href=""http://www.food-scp.eu/""><mark>sustainable</mark> consumption and production roundtable</A> where the food industry sits alongside the European Commission.</P><P>At the time, we found this was creating more <mark>sustainable</mark> confusion than <mark>sustainable</mark> consumption. And so we agreed on the need for a harmonised methodology to assess the environmental footprint of products.</P><P>So we first established some key principles on how to assess the environmental performance of products along the whole value chain and how to communicate this to consumers. Two years ago, this concluded with the publication of the first <A href=""http://www.food-scp.eu/files/ENVIFOOD_Protocol_Vers_1.0.pdf"">envi-food protocol</A>. And this has now resulted in the <A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/pef_pilots.htm"">Product Environmental Footprint pilots</A>, which were launched by the European Commission.</P><P>Almost half of the PEF pilots are related to the food sector. And I represent the food sector in the steering committee of the PEFs, because the Commission recognised we were the most advanced sector in terms of working towards a harmonised methodology for measuring environmental performance along the supply chain.</P><P><STRONG>Several PEFs were launched in areas like beer, dairy, coffee, packed water, etc. How far have you gone?</STRONG></P><P>It’s a three-year process which started in 2014. For the time being, there are regular meetings of the steering committee. So where are we? First, pilots have been selected. As a company, Nestlé is very much involved, we participate in three pilots — on coffee, packed water and pet food.</P><P>We are certainly the company which is the most active in this project because we fully support the work towards a harmonised methodology. We believe this is absolutely necessary if we want to provide reliable information to consumers, which is also recognised by the entire European food and drink industry.</P><P>Now, the pilots are working to define the so-called product category rules. And they are starting to examine how to communicate the results to the public, which will happen next year.</P><P><STRONG>When do you expect the first methodologies to be agreed? And once they are agreed, do they become industry standards?</STRONG></P><P>The first methodology is the envi-food protocol. This is a harmonised framework to assess food and drink products, which has been defined by industry together with the Commission. Now, the PEF projects go beyond the food sector but the methodology is fully consistent with the envi-food protocol.</P><P>So the objective is that, at the end of next year (2016), PEF pilots will have established their specific sub-rules for categories. These will be tested on some products at the end of this year and communicated next year, which will complete the pilots. And then the Commission wants during one year (2017) to review this 3-year project and see what policy conclusions can be drawn.</P><P><STRONG>Looking forward, could some of these methodologies become mandatory?</STRONG></P><P>This will be voluntary, I believe, not mandatory. There are three objectives of this pilot: establish product category rules; clear validation processes so that figures are credible and comparable; and test communication tools.</P><P><STRONG>But the outcome would be to replace the current plethora of labels with one single label, or certificate?</STRONG></P><P>I wouldn’t call it label because there is already an eco-label. Labels are like certification, either you’re in or you’re out.</P><P>Rather, we believe the benefit of the PEF quantified approach is that you can have a kind of progression level. A little bit like you have already today for electric appliances, a grading from A, B, C to G. Now, the challenge is to combine different environmental indicators because you cannot have just one parameter. For electric appliances, it’s energy consumption — easy. But if you take food, there are more parameters: water consumption, biodiversity impact, greenhouse gas emissions. And the challenge is to combine these dimensions which are all relevant, into a simple communication tool.</P><P>At Nestlé, we did a pilot two or three years ago in France, for coffee ? Nescafé and Nespresso. We came up with three indicators: on water, greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity impact. And we provided the information via a mobile phone application. Because everybody agreed this was too much information to put on the packaging. So that’s what we did in France with the <A href=""http://imaginationforpeople.org/fr/project/proxi-produit/"">Proxi Produit</A> pilot.</P><P>In Europe, we have to see. I don’t know if it’s feasible to have one single parameter with grading from A to G.</P><P><STRONG>I understand there is no unified industry position on this, because it’s early stages. But I assume consumer organisations would prefer a single label that can be placed on the pack. Is this something you would support?</STRONG></P><P>On the pack, I’m not sure. Even the consumer organisations realise that it’s impossible to have everything on the pack. Everybody has a smartphone and there are fantastic apps with which you can get detailed info about some products. Anyway, it’s not possible to put all the information on the pack.</P><P>At Nestlé, we are not ashamed of the environmental performance of our products. On the contrary, we want to communicate the information and we want to make this known and visible to consumers. Those interested have the right to have access to this information. That’s why we have a plan to put progressively on our product a square code which allows getting information, not only about the environmental performance, but also nutritional information and other social aspects related to the supply chain of a product.</P><P><STRONG>You mentioned water, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity… Would you add any others to the list? I guess you don’t want to make it too long, right?</STRONG></P><P>It may vary from category to category but for food products, water is definitely the key one ?you know that 70% of freshwater is used in agriculture. Greenhouse gases, of course. And biodiversity, even though it’s difficult to assess, it’s an area that deserves attention. So I would stick to these three ones.</P><P><STRONG>What role do you see for the retailers? Some, like Leclerc in France, have taken the initiative to show the total <mark>CO2</mark> footprint of consumers’ shopping baskets on their receipt. What do you think of such initiatives? Is it helpful, or is it adding to the confusion?</STRONG></P><P>It can indeed be perceived as confusing. But we are now in phase where we need to test. Tesco a few years ago announced they would put the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of all their products. Now, they have abandoned this idea for many reasons.</P><P>One of the consequences we have to take into account is the cost. Because if we want to calculate the environmental footprint of every product that is put on the shelves, it will have a cost. Especially because it has to be done in an accurate way, tracking and tracing the data, the origin, etc. So I think it is not for tomorrow.</P><P>Retailers have been part of the SCP roundtable. Certainly we have to collaborate but also with the upstream supply chain because it’s in our shared interest to provide clear and understandable information to consumers.</P><P><STRONG>So you don’t believe consumers are ready to pay more for environmentally-friendly products? The growing demand for organic shows some people are ready to do it.</STRONG></P><P>Organic is growing, it’s true. In our products, environmental concern is something which is mainstream. It’s become part of our brand, it brings value to it. And consumers will turn to products which are not only tastier and healthier but also better for the environment.</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Exactly forty years later, bottled water passed soda as the largest US beverage category, with Americans consuming 12.8 billion gallons in 2016 [2]. Nestlé has benefited massively from this astronomical growth, selling $4.5 billion of bottled water in North American in 2016 [3]. However, increased <mark>climate change</mark>-related droughts and changing precipitation patterns present a threat to Nestlé’s North American bottled water operations.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Clouds on the horizon</STRONG></P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> is shifting global hydrological patterns, increasing precipitation in some regions while decreasing it in others [4]. Unfortunately, many of Nestle’s key spring resources are located in drought prone regions, such as in Southern California (see Figure 1) [5], which experienced the most significant drought in state history from 2012-2017 [6]. While citizens faced severe water restrictions, Nestle extracted 700 million gallons of groundwater in 2015, resulting in petitions, lawsuits [8], and even plastic pitchfork-bearing protestors [8]. As Nestle continued operations, competitors, such as Starbucks, decided to end bottling operations in California in 2015 [9]. Additionally, for the first time in thirty years, the U.S. Forest Service reviewed Nestle’s permit to withdraw water from the San Bernardino Mountains [10].</P><P>Nestle faces similar opposition elsewhere in the US (Michigan, Colorado, Arizona, and Washington [11])  and in Canada (British Columbia and Ontario) [12]. For example, in 2013, the Ontario Environment Ministry placed restrictions on Nestle’s water withdrawal permit [13] and proposed a “moratorium on new or expanded groundwater takings” [14] following protests about Nestle’s continued daily withdrawal of 1.1 million liters from the Hillsburgh Well throughout a 2013 drought [15].</P><P>As <mark>climate change</mark> continues to stress historical water sources, Nestle will likely face new restrictions, higher permit fees, and renewed public criticism.</P><P><STRONG>Nestle’s response</STRONG></P><P>In the short term, Nestle has responded by committing to internal water reduction goals while simultaneously working with governments to ensure continued access to water resources. For instance, amidst the 2015 drought in California, Nestle committed to an 8% water efficiency improvement in their California bottling through new technology investment [16]. In their non-bottled water factories, Nestle also invested in water conserving technologies, such as moving to “zero water” in their Modesto, California milk plant [17].</P><P>On the government front, Nestle Waters North America spent $120,000 in 2016 to lobby the US Government on water-related issues [18]. In Ontario, in 2017, Nestle worked with the government to avoid the proposed withdrawal moratorium and increase their permit fee from $3.71 to $503.71 per million liters, a 135x increase [19] (though tiny compared to the $300,000 that one million liters sells for at Walmart Canada [20].)</P><P>Finally, Nestle has attempted to engender goodwill with local communities through actions such as donating a $45,000 playground to the District of Hope, British Columbia – where it extracts 265 million liters annually [21].</P><P>By 2020, Nestle has committed to “reduce direct water withdrawals…35% [compared to] 2010” [22] and carry out forty new “Water Resource Reviews” across global sites [23]. In addition, Nestle has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by 2020, addressing the <mark>climate change</mark> underpinnings of their water issues [24].</P><P><STRONG>Shifting the tide</STRONG></P><P>As none of Nestle’s responses have addressed the issue of disappearing groundwater sources, there are three options that Nestle should consider:</P><P>First, Nestle should explore new water resources in regions where <mark>climate change</mark> is decreasing drought, such as in the Pacific Northwest and the Upper Great Plains, which could serve the Western and Midwestern markets, respectively. Figure 2 suggests some target regions for such exploration.</P><P>Second, rather than sourcing exclusively from natural watersheds, Nestle should explore technologies to convert non-potable water into bottled water. This concept is already used in water-strapped Israel and Singapore, and is gaining traction in the US [25]. For example, in June 2017, Orange County Water District was the first entity in the Western Hemisphere to bottle and distribute water from recycled wastewater [26]. Nestle already has much of the technical expertise to pursue this path, as it already employs reverse osmosis, micro-filtration, and ozone disinfection in its water bottle production facilities [27].</P><P>Finally, Nestle should build an active voice in the global water community. As water demand is expected to exceed <mark>sustainable</mark> demand by 40% by 2030, there will be increased discussion on how to correctly price water, which will likely result in price hikes [28]. While Nestle currently benefits significantly from the underpricing of water, it is vital they join the debates that will shape the future of water prices.</P><P><STRONG>Thinking about H2O</STRONG></P><P>Nestle’s bottled water operations raise two key questions to ponder:</P><UL><LI>What role do governments have in pricing and selling natural resources for-profit corporations? Does this role change when scarcity increases?</LI><LI>Does it matter that Americans drink 35 million gallons of bottled water daily when the rest of the US uses 306 billion gallons daily?

    Nestlé SA
</A><SPAN style=""color:Green;""> &gt; </SPAN><SPAN>Workers' Rights</SPAN><DIV><H4>Worst Ethical Consumer rating for cocoa supply chain management</H4><P>In April 2018 Ethical Consumer searched Nestle's 2017 &quot;Nestle in Society&quot; and 2017 &quot;Cocoa Plan: Tackling Child Labour&quot; reports, for information on the company's cocoa sourcing policies.  

These stated that &quot;Around a third of Nestlé’s total global cocoa supply is currently bought from producers covered by the Nestlé Cocoa Plan&quot;. 

It sourced cocoa from  Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Indonesia, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico and Venezuela. 

Ethical Consumer expected companies to have certified 100% of their chocolate products or to only source from outside of West Africa where the issues of child labour are widely reported. 

Ethical Consumer noted that Nestle's Cocoa Plan had been strongly praised by Stop the Traffik. However, due to the fact that the company was still sourcing some uncertified cocoa, and the issue of child and slave labour in cocoa supply chains had been known since before 2000, it was marked down in the Workers' Rights category.</P><SMALL>Nestlé SA Corporate Communications:Nestle in Society report 2017 (17 April 2018)</SMALL></DIV><DIV><H4>External criticism for abuses in palm oil supply chain</H4><P>On 30th November 2016 Amnesty International released a report called “The Great Palm Oil Scandal: Labour Abuses Behind Big Brands Names.” The report investigated labour exploitation on plantations in Indonesia that provide palm oil to Wilmar, one of the world’s largest processors and merchandisers of palm and lauric (palm kernel) oils, which controls over 43% of the global palm oil trade. The report also traced the palm oil produced in Indonesia for Wilmar to a range of consumer goods 
companies that use palm oil in their products. 
Amnesty International found serious human rights abuses on the plantations of Wilmar and its suppliers. These included forced labour and child labour, gender discrimination, as well as exploitative and dangerous working practices that put the health of workers at risk. The abuses identified were not isolated incidents but due to systemic business practices by Wilmar’s subsidiaries and suppliers, in particular the low level of wages, the use of targets and ‘piece rates’ (where workers are paid based on tasks completed rather than hours worked), and the use of a complex system of financial and other penalties. Workers, especially women, are employed under casual work arrangements, which make them vulnerable to abuses.  
Amnesty stated “All of these are obvious and predictable areas of concern and risk. However, none of the companies that buy palm oil from Wilmar could demonstrate to Amnesty International that they had identified and addressed the actual abuses documented by Amnesty International.”
Nestlé said “…we confirm that we source, indirectly, palm oil from all refineries mentioned in
your letter, with the exception of PT Wilmar Nabati Indonesia in Bagendang, which we do not source from at all.”
Nestlé told Amnesty International that it had been monitoring Wilmar for human rights related reasons since 2010. Despite this claim, Nestlé did not appear to have identified the severe labour abuses investigated by Amnesty International on Wilmar’s and its suppliers’ plantations. Nestlé said that it had suspended a portion of trade with Wilmar from 2010 to 2012 for reasons related to environmental practices. In a letter to Amnesty International, the company said that: “…origins of a
proportion of palm oil provided [by Wilmar] were not in alignment with RSG [Responsible Sourcing Guidelines]. However, following extensive engagement we received assurances that it would change its practices, and our full commercial relationship restarted.”
Nestlé said that between the years of 2010 and 2013 the company was “…also gathering information on human rights issues during this period.” In relation to Wilmar, it said that “56.06% (25,587 tonnes) [of palm oil] is being monitored through our Responsible Sourcing Action Plan”. It stated: “Wilmar does not currently comply with all Nestlé’s RSG requirements yet”, but that Wilmar “…has made a policy commitment, with a time bound Aggregator Refinery Transformation (ART) plan.” Amnesty said that the ART plan was extremely limited in scope. While Nestlé states that Wilmar was non-compliant with parts of its own RSG policy, it did not disclose whether this non-compliance relates to labour standards.
In response to Amnesty International’s findings, Nestlé stated that: “We believe that our due diligence system, based upon the various steps noted above (risk assessment, supply chain transparency, on the ground assessments and action plans with suppliers, backed by suspending suppliers who are unwilling to improve) is a strong one.” However, despite its detailed response, Nestlé failed to demonstrate that it had, through its internal processes, identified labour risks or abuses linked to Wilmar’s Indonesian palm oil supply prior to being contacted by Amnesty International.
Nestlé therefore lost half a mark under Palm Oil and a whole mark under Workers' Rights.</P><SMALL>Amnesty International:The Great Palm Oil Scandal: Labour Abuses Behind Big Brands Names (30 November 2016)</SMALL></DIV><DIV><H4>Rated 'fair' by Oxfams Behind the Brand report</H4><P>In August 2017 Ethical Consumer viewed the April 2016 &quot;Behind the brands&quot; scorecard, produced by Oxfam as part of its GROW campaign. The campaign evaluated the world's top 10 most powerful food and beverage companies. It aimed to challenge the companies to begin a &quot;race to the top&quot; to improve their social and environmental performance. 
Nestlé was ranked second out of the ten companies in the scorecard. Overall Nestlé scored 48/70 and was rated 'fair' by Oxfam. The company was rated in seven areas based on information publicly available and marked out of ten for each area. 
According to the report Nestlé scored:
- 8/10 for its land policies - In August 2014, Nestlé adopted a strong policy – it committed to zero tolerance for land grabbing. Nestlé also required its suppliers to support the ‘Free, Prior, and Informed Consent’ of indigenous and local communities, and would encourage sourcing country governments to implement strong land tenure.
- 5/10 for policies on women - Nestlé delivered a quality gender impact assessment in the cocoa sector and had set ambitious targets in its action plan for 2015. The company was making considerable efforts to gather stakeholder input on its gender equality targets for cocoa. 
- 7/10 for policies on farmers - Nestlé’s disclosure about its involvement with smallholders was one of the most advanced, and the company was working with its suppliers to tackle issues faced by small-scale farmers. It required suppliers to support farmers’ organisations, but it still doesn’t ensure that farmers earn a living income. 
- 6/10 for policies regarding workers -  Nestlé scored highly on workers rights, but the company could do much more to ensure workers in its supply chain were able to work their way out of poverty. Nestlé should start recording the wages that workers were paid so that they can be compared to living wage benchmarks. The company should also develop a strategy for raising low wages. 
- 8/10 for policies on <mark>climate change</mark> - Nestlé  was rising to the <mark>climate</mark> challenge with solid policies on deforestation, palm oil, agricultural emissions, and advocacy engagement. There was still room for improvement on implementation of commitments, renewable energy goals, and setting science-based targets for emissions reductions.
- 7/10 for transparency: Nestle was one of the top in Transparency. It revealed where it sourced from, how much it sourced for key commodities, including some key suppliers. Nestle provided excellent sustainability reporting and was the only company disclosing the ratio of CEO and median employee pay, but it provided very limited information on taxation.
- 7/10 on water: Nestle supported major water initiatives and has the most specific guidance to suppliers on water management out of all of the companies examined.
Due to the fact Nestlé received a best rating for its policies on <mark>climate change</mark> it did not lose a mark under Ethical Consumer's <mark>climate change</mark> category. 
Although it overall did quite well, Nestlé lost half a mark under Human Rights and half a mark under Workers' Rights for scoring less than 7 on women and workers.</P><SMALL>Oxfam International:Behind the Brands April 2016 scorecard (19 April 2016)</SMALL></DIV><DIV><H4>Nestle admits to slavery in Thai supply chain</H4><P>According to an article on the Guardian website dated 1st Feb 2016 and viewed by Ethical Consumer in Feb 2016, Nestle had admitted to finding slavery in its Thai seafood supply chain. 
Andrew Wallis, chief executive of Unseen UK, argued that Nestlé’s self-reporting could also be seen as a tactic to head off or deflate other pending civil litigation suits. “It’s easy to own up to something that has already been uncovered,” he said. “By the time Nestlé owned up to slavery in the Thai seafood industry it was accepted knowledge.&quot;
Nestlé therefore lost a whole mark under Workers' Rights.</P><SMALL>Guardian website www.guardian.co.uk:Nestlé admits slavery in Thailand while fighting child labour lawsuit in Ivory Coast  (22 February 2</SMALL></DIV><DIV><H4>Called to investigate modern-day slavery in palm oil sourcing</H4><P>In August 2015 Ethical Consumer viewed the business and human rights website, business-humanrights.org, and found a story naming Nestlé as a customer of Cargill who were buying palm oil from the Malaysian palm oil grower Felda Global Venture’s plantations.
A Wall Street Journal investigation had been published in July 2015, exposing serious human rights and labour abuses on the plantations including human trafficking, forced labor, and withholding of wages.
Felda had been members of the Roundtable on <mark>Sustainable</mark> Palm Oil since 2004. A coalition of NGOs called on the RSPO, Malaysian Government and international buyers for an open investigation into The Wall Street Journal’s findings.
Felda denied the allegations.
Nestlé therefore lost half a mark under Human Rights and half a mark under Workers' Rights.</P><SMALL>Nestlé SA Corporate Communications:http://business-humanrights.org/en/malaysia-migrant-workers-abuses-reported-at-felda-palm-oil-planta</SMALL></DIV><DIV><H4>Forced labour in fish supply chain</H4><P>A report in the New York Times on 27th July 2015 exposed the use of forced labour in the South China Sea. The article outlined how migrants were often sold onto fishing boats where they were held captive and forced to work, sometimes for years.
The article focused on a Cambodian man, Lang Long, who was sold by traffickers to a Thai fishing boat, where he was often shackled by the neck, during his two years of captivity. Mr. Long did not know where the fish he caught ended up. He did learn, however, that most of the forage fish on the final boat where he was held in bondage was destined for a cannery called the Songkla Canning Public Company, which is a subsidiary of Thai Union Frozen Products, the country’s largest seafood company. In the past year, Thai Union has shipped more than 28 million pounds of seafood-based cat and dog food for some of the top brands sold in America including Iams (owned by Mars), Meow Mix and Fancy Feast (owned by Nestle), according to United States Customs documents.
Lisa K. Gibby, vice president of corporate communications for Nestlé, which makes pet food brands including Fancy Feast and Purina, said that the company is working hard to ensure that forced labor is not used to produce its pet food. “This is neither an easy nor a quick endeavor,” she added, because the fish it purchases comes from multiple ports and fishing vessels operating in international waters.
Following the report, in September 2015 a group of consumers filed a class-action lawsuit in California against Nestle over the use of this forced labour in its pet food supply chain. The lawsuit accused Nestle of violating consumer protection laws, including false advertising and unfair competition, by failing to disclose the use of forced labour.
Nestlé therefore lost a whole mark under Workers' Rights.</P><SMALL>New York Times Website:‘Sea Slaves’: The Human Misery That Feeds Pets and Livestock (27 July 2015)</SMALL></DIV><DIV><H4>Child slavery case</H4><P>According to the article 'Nestlé, Cargill and ADM face child slavery case', published on the Confectionery News website, www.confectionarynews.com, on January 27th 2014, three companies, one of which was Nestlé, were facing litigation regarding the use of child slave labour. Three Malian men had won the right to bring their civil child slavery case against the companies to Californian courts. Nestlé was accused of aiding and abetting the enticement of the men from Mali to the Ivory Coast in the 1990s. The men, who were children at the time, then worked unpaid on cocoa farms supplying Nestlé.</P><SMALL>Confectionary News:Nestlé, Cargill and ADM face child slavery case  (27 January 2014)</SMALL></DIV><DIV><H4>Concerns over child labour in mica supply chain</H4><P>On 19 February 2014, the Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre reported on an expose by The Age magazine (theage.com) in January 2014 which stated that child labour was endemic in the mica mines in India. It stated that &quot;industry here is…dependent on a huge unskilled workforce, forced into working for lower and lower prices…work is hard and dangerous. Children working risk snake and scorpion bites, and the hollowed-out caves they mine in often collapse. They suffer cuts and skin infections, as well as respiratory illnesses, such as bronchitis, silicosis and asthma…&quot;.
Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre invited L’Oréal to respond, and the company gave the following statement, dated 3 February 2014:
 “ L’Oréal expects its suppliers and subcontractors to comply with the Group’s General Terms and Conditions of Purchase, which entails the prohibition of child labor.
Since 2009 when L’Oréal was first alerted that there was a possibility of child labor in the collection of mica in India, the Group has worked closely with its suppliers to secure its supply chain of mica against any such risk.
The Group has also significantly lowered its supply of mica sourced in India, in favor of other geographical sources (namely the United States). Our main suppliers such as Merck are better placed to comment the important work they’ve done in establishing a child-labor free supply chain of mica in India. We strongly support these efforts and will continue to be demanding of our suppliers on this question.&quot;
The company lost half a mark under Workers' Rights due to lack of clear policy addressing this issue.</P><SMALL>Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre:India's mica mines: The shameful truth behind mineral make-up's shimmer [India] (19 February 2014)</SMALL></DIV><DIV><H4>Union activist killed</H4><P>On the 12th November 2013, Colombia Reports online, www.colombia.co, reported that a Nestlé worker and activist of the food union Sinaltrainal had been killed on the 9th November in a suspected paramilitary attack in the town of Bugalagrande in western Colombia.
Oscar Lopez, who worked for Nestlé for more than 25 years, was killed in a bar by unknown gunmen on Saturday night.
Lopez was an active member of the union and had been involved in the long lasting dispute about union rights between Nestlé and Sinaltrainal. Some activists had started a hunger strike in October, which was paused momentarily because of threats, but resumed on November 5th.
The night before the attack, several activists received threatening text messages saying, “you still are bothering Nestlé, now there will be no more mercy! We are going to chop you up. Death to all communists of Sinaltrainal!”
The message was signed by the name “Los Urabeños,” one of the country’s most notorious neo-paramilitary groups.
The murder constitutes a climax in the persistent labor conflict between Nestlé and Sinaltrainal, which escalated after Nestlé withdrew from negotiations a few months ago.
According to Swiss human rights group Multiwatch, Nestlé had been pressuring workers to join a rival union and trying to delegitimise the work of Sinaltrainal.
This incident comes only two weeks after a report was published that declared the failure of a bilateral plan which was set up between the U.S. and Colombian government three years ago to alleviate the serious labour problems in the country.
Human rights group Multiwatch stated that Oscar Lopez’s case was the 15th violent death of Nestlé workers in Colombia, while Nestlé admits the deaths of seven workers and several white-collar employees.</P><SMALL>Colombia Reports:Nestle worker and union activist killed by paramilitary in western Colombia (12 November 2013)</SMALL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

<mark>Climate change</mark> could destroy West Africa's cocoa farms, disrupting domestic and international economies, experts say.</P><P>
By 2060, more than half of the cocoa-producing countries in the region may be too hot to grow the crop, according to a report released by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture. If scientists can't engineer a drought-resistant cocoa tree, the international market will see a significant increase in prices, and West African nations may experience a spike in poverty, drug trafficking and food riots.</P><P>&quot;Hopefully, Ghana or West Africa is able to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark> to maintain their cocoa production,&quot; said Peter Laderach, a researcher at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture. &quot;People will continue eating chocolate. If they don't produce it, someone else will.&quot;</P><P>
Worldwide, the cocoa industry is a $5.1 billion market, with West Africa growing more than half of the 3 million tons sold annually, according to the World Cocoa Foundation (WCF). Ivory Coast and Ghana are the two largest producers, but rising temperatures will make it difficult for these countries to hold on to that lead.</P><P>
The cocoa industry is already reporting an estimated 1.5 million ton shortage by 2020. And El Niño weather patterns forecast for later this year could exacerbate the issue, as severe weather alters growing patterns, according to <EM>Coffee and Cocoa International</EM>, an industry publication.</P><P>
While supply decreases, global demand is projected to rise. The United States and Europe have always been large buyers, but now that China and South Korea are also investing in cocoa products, market competition will only intensify, said Mbalo Ndiaye, the director of the WCF's West Africa office.</P><P>
Such scarcity has had a profound effect on industry pricing. In 2000, cocoa cost $714 per ton, but by the spring of 2011, it was at a high of $3,775 per ton, according to <EM>Coffee and Cocoa International</EM>. Higher prices don't necessarily trickle down to farmers, whose abject poverty prevents them from making long-term plans to compensate for increased temperatures.</P><P>&quot;We're dealing with some of the poorest countries in the world ... where there's political instability,&quot; said Elan Emanuel, a supply chain manager at Fair Trade USA. &quot;<mark>Climate change</mark> is the least of their worries.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Problem for big companies and small farmers</STRONG>
Yet it's one of the main issues for manufacturers worldwide. Chocolate is used in a variety of products; lotions, body washes and even cosmetics contain traces of the bean. It's also a culturally significant crop for many countries. About 5.5 million cocoa farmers rely on the business for their livelihoods, passing down small family farms from generation to generation, Ndiaye said.</P><P>&quot;We've been growing cocoa for years,&quot; he added. &quot;It dated back from the colonial era.&quot;</P><P>
However, cocoa didn't begin as a West African tradition. According to the WCF, it was the Mayans in South America who started the trend, using cocoa in rituals and assigning it a monetary value. Ancient texts show that a horse could be purchased with just 10 beans.</P><P>
When the Spaniards conquered the Western world, Mayan infatuation with the bean jumped the Atlantic Ocean and spread throughout Europe. By the 18th century, countries around the globe wanted a taste of &quot;theobroma cacao,&quot; or &quot;food of the gods.&quot;</P><P>
The bean hasn't lost its popularity, which is why conservationists are working to improve farming conditions in West Africa. Organizations have launched programs that teach landowners how to shade their cocoa trees and lay down ground cover to increase soil moisture. However, these methods will have only a minimal cooling impact. In the long run, no amount of simple adaptation methods will be exceptionally effective against rising temperatures.</P><P>
The optimum altitude for cocoa is 300 to 800 feet above sea level, which will increase to 1,475 to 1,640 feet above sea level by 2050 due to <mark>climate change</mark>, according to a September 2011 study published by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture.</P><P>&quot;Long term, the farmer can't do anything,&quot; Laderach said. &quot;You need universities, you need research.&quot;</P><P>
You need drought-resistant cocoa trees, he added.</P><P><STRONG>Can genetic modification come to the rescue?</STRONG>
Genetic engineering and selective breeding are rallying cries among conservationists, politicians and industry leaders. The international community has firmly placed its faith in science.</P><P>
It's not an unfounded confidence. Researchers have achieved similar feats with the technology: cows that produce more milk, fish that thrive in freezing conditions. Temperature-resilient cocoa trees are certainly possible -- but they're not available now.</P><P>
Cocoa trees require about five years of growth to reach maturity, according to the WCF. It could take the scientific community decades to produce a viable cocoa hybrid, Ndiaye said. By the time these plants pass rigorous testing, undergo mass production and are shipped to their intended recipients, it's likely that cocoa shortages will already be a problem for Mars Inc. and <mark>Nestle SA</mark> -- two of the world's largest chocolate manufacturing companies.</P><P>
Scientists must also take pests and cocoa-specific diseases into account when designing the ideal cocoa tree. As temperatures rise and stress the cocoa trees, the plants become more susceptible to pathogens.</P><P>&quot;About a third of the crop is lost each year to diseases and pests,&quot; said Bill Guyton, the president of the WCF. &quot;When the plant is more stressed, there's more of a risk factor of diseases or pests.&quot;</P><P>
Even if scientists were able to present a modified cocoa tree today, there's no guarantee West Africans would immediately benefit from the technology.</P><P>&quot;The biggest challenge that we have is that there are so many small-scale farmers living in remote areas, so access to these farmers is a big challenge,&quot; Guyton said. &quot;And another big problem is that very few of them are organized; less than 20 percent belong to some sort of cooperative or organization, so it makes it difficult to work with them.&quot;</P><P>
Furthermore, most locals can't afford to replant -- just 1 hectare of cocoa trees costs at least $1,000, a figure that does not include fertilizer and other tools needed to care for the saplings, Ndiaye said.</P><P><STRONG>Some ugly consequences</STRONG>
Such logistical hang-ups appear to leave West Africans unprepared for future climatic changes. And the consequences of such vulnerability are more dire than a spike in American chocolate prices.</P><P>&quot;There've been large-scale efforts; cocoa has been used as an alternative livelihood project to wean farmers off [growing] cocaine,&quot; Emanuel said.</P><P>
Take away cocoa, and agriculturalists may resort to coca, the plant base of cocaine, which could result in a variety of domestic and international complications -- drug trafficking, violence, and all the costs and resources associated with outreach and intervention.</P><P>
Food riots are also likely, Ndiaye said. As the <mark>climate</mark> warms, crop yields for staples could decline. The first response from governments and businesses will be to import, he added, affecting trade balance and driving up prices.</P><P>
Cocoa provides 7.5 percent of the gross domestic product in Ivory Coast and 3.4 percent of the GDP in Ghana, according to the International Center for Tropical Agriculture's study. Cocoa farmers, already strapped for cash, may not be able to afford the cost spike in food essentials.</P><P>&quot;There would be huge implications for poverty levels in Africa; that's why it's really important to maintain cocoa in this area,&quot; Laderach said.</P><P>
Regions including Asia, South America or parts of Africa that were previously too cool to grow cocoa may plant more trees and could possibly pick up the slack in the market. However, it's unlikely that they will be able to meet market demands, which are projected to increase 3 percent per year as they have for the past century, according to the WCF.</P><P>
The switch to new regions will change the flavor profile of chocolate, which depends heavily on growing conditions. Such transitions are potentially worrisome for large corporations concerned about brand image and advertising.</P><P>
These companies, desperate to retain their market shares, have implemented various outreach programs to help farmers, many of whom have left their rural villages in the hopes of finding better work in the cities.</P><P>&quot;Businesses are worried about <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; Emanuel said. &quot;These guys are just trying to figure out what to eat for dinner at night as opposed to their livelihoods 20 years down the road.&quot;</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>wire with permission from Environment &amp; Energy Publishing, LLC. <A href=""https://www.eenews.net"" target=""_blank"">www.eenews.net</A>, 202-628-6500</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3><SECTION class=""article-author""><DIV class=""article-author__main""><P class=""article-author__name t_body t_body--article"">Mollie Bloudoff-Indelicato</P><P class=""article-author__desc t_body t_body--article""><A href=""http://www.mbloudoff.com"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Mollie Bloudoff-Indelicato</A> is an environmental reporting fellow at <A href=""http://www.eenews.net/public/"" target=""_blank"" title="""">E&amp;E Publishing</A>, covering the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on everything from the international chocolate industry to methane hydrates in Antarctica.

The coffee pod fully encapsulates pre-portioned coffee grounds and flavoring inside a disposable capsule. This unique design allows casual coffee brewers to consistently reproduce their favorite café beverage at home with minimal preparation and effort. But the ease of the ubiquitous pod has a downside. Pod-based coffee machines produce much more waste on a per-cup basis than the conventional drip coffee maker, and their waste is far more troublesome than simply paper and coffee grounds: Nestlé’s Nespresso coffee pods, for example, encase coffee in an aluminum capsule. The additional packaging required for pod-based coffees has triggered <A href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/coffee-pods-why-we-all-want-what-george-clooney-is-having-8182487.html"">criticism from the environmental community</A>.</P><P>In response to environmental concerns, some coffee pod manufacturers have made efforts to recycle used pods. In 2009, Nestlé launched its <A href=""http://www.nespresso.com/ecolaboration/medias_dyn/articles/9/article/attachment-2.pdf"">AluCycle initiative</A>, which aims to put thousands of dedicated coffee capsule collection points in place to recycle 75% of used Nespresso capsules by 2013. The focus of these collection points is aluminum recycling, <A href=""http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/tools/localgov/benefits/"">which produces enormous energy and greenhouse gas savings compared to aluminum from virgin sources</A>.</P><P>Nestlé’s aluminum recycling leaves them with an abundance of leftover coffee grounds. Presently, Nestlé mixes spent coffee grounds with organic matter to produce compost. Recent work <A href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261912004011"">published</A> by researchers at Spain’s <A href=""http://www.incar.csic.es/informacion-general"">Instituto Nacional del Carbón</A> shows that Nestlé could potentially further increase the <mark>climate</mark> benefit of its recycling efforts by repurposing used coffee grounds into <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage material.</P><P><mark>Carbon</mark> capture and storage materials are a vital part of overcoming <mark>climate change</mark>. The International Energy Agency estimates that about one fifth of required greenhouse gas reductions will come from <mark>carbon</mark> <A href=""http://www.iea.org/topics/ccs/"">capture and storage</A> by 2050. An attractive solution is capturing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from a power plant’s exhaust, so that existing facilities can be retrofitted and brought up to modern <mark>carbon</mark> standards. The Spanish researchers are hoping that their work with spent coffee pods will help develop an inexpensive <mark>carbon</mark> capture solution that is appealing to the energy industry.</P><P>So, how does one turn old coffee grounds into a <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide scrubber? The key is transforming the plentiful <mark>carbon</mark> in coffee grounds into <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_<mark>carbon</mark>"">activated <mark>carbon</mark></A>. Activated <mark>carbon</mark> is used in a number of filtration applications. It holds onto contaminants via its enormous surface area; small micropores on its surface attract and lock in molecules. If engineered correctly, activated <mark>carbon</mark> can remove much of the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from the hot gases exiting a coal power plant’s smoke stack.</P><P>In their <A href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261912004011"">paper</A> published in the journal Applied Energy, Plaza, González, Pevida, Pis, and Rubiera from Spain’s Instituto Nacional del Carbón develop two methods to transform grounds from spent Nespresso coffee pods into valuable activated <mark>carbon</mark>. The first method uses just <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and heat. Spent coffee grounds are heated at 600 in the presence of nitrogen gas until they resemble charcoal. Then, the temperature is cranked up to 700 and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is introduced to activate the surface of the charred coffee grounds. Doing so creates micropores that are attractive to errant <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide molecules.</P><P>The second method developed by Plaza and colleagues uses basic potassium hydroxide to create a more intricate surface on the spent coffee grounds. The grounds are heated at 100 to remove excess moisture, and then soaked with potassium hydroxide. The mixture is gradually heated up to 400 with nitrogen gas until the potassium hydroxide melts off and chars with the spent coffee. Finally, the whole charred mixture is heated one last time at 600 and then thoroughly washed and dried. This chemically driven process creates an elaborate pore structure on the charred coffee grounds that is attractive to <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide.</P><P>To test the effectiveness of their low-cost activated <mark>carbon</mark>s, Plaza and colleagues exposed them to both pure <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide gas and a mix of gases that resembles the flue gas from a coal power plant. With their intricate pore structure, the coffee grounds activated with potassium hydroxide stored more <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the presence of pure <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide gas. However, the grounds treated with just heat and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide filtered the mix of gases resembling coal emissions more selectively. Nitrogen and other elements tended to clog the available pores on the potassium-activated coffee grounds. Thus, Plaza and colleagues have shown that coffee grounds treated with just heat and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide could effectively scrub some of the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from coal power plant emissions.</P><P>The work by Plaza and others at Spain’s Instituto Nacional del Carbón shows that uniform forms of waste like spent coffee grounds from pod-based coffees could become an inexpensive method of stemming <mark>climate change</mark> in the future. Both waste heat and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide are abundant at any coal power plant. Plaza and colleagues predict that <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide captured from a coal plant could be repurposed to produce activated <mark>carbon</mark> from spent coffee on site. If such a process is developed at an industrial scale, three forms of waste (heat, <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, and used coffee) could be combined and repurposed to form <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage material, a technology vital to the <mark>climate</mark> and humanity’s future.</P><P><EM>Photo Credit: Nestle Nespresso.</EM></P><P><EM>Robert Fares is Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin.

have led to marked natural <mark>climate change</mark> in Europe over the last 1000 
years, according to researchers at Cardiff University.</P><P>Scientists studied seafloor sediments to determine how the 
temperature of the North Atlantic and its localised atmospheric 
circulation had altered. Warm surface waters flowing across the North 
Atlantic, an extension of the Gulf Stream, and warm westerly winds are 
responsible for the relatively mild <mark>climate</mark> of Europe, especially in 
winter. Slight changes in the transport of heat associated with these 
systems can led to regional <mark>climate</mark> variability, and the study findings 
matched historic accounts of <mark>climate change</mark>, including the notoriously 
severe winters of the 16<SUP>th</SUP> and 18<SUP>th</SUP> centuries which pre-date global industrialisation.</P><P>The study found that changes in the Sun's activity can have a 
considerable impact on the ocean-atmospheric dynamics in the North 
Atlantic, with potential effects on regional <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>Predictions suggest a prolonged period of low sun activity over the 
next few decades, but any associated natural temperature changes will be
 much smaller than those created by human <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions, say 
researchers.</P><P>The study, led by Cardiff University scientists, in collaboration 
with colleagues at the University of Bern, is published today in the 
journal <STRONG><EM><A href=""http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2094.html""><STRONG><EM>Nature Geoscience</EM></STRONG></A></EM></STRONG>.</P><P>Dr Paola Moffa-Sanchez, lead author, explained: &quot;We used seafloor 
sediments taken from south of Iceland to study changes in the warm 
surface ocean current. This was done by analysing the chemical 
composition of fossilised microorganisms that had once lived in the 
surface of the ocean. These measurements were then used to reconstruct 
the seawater temperature and the salinity of this key ocean current over
 the past 1000 years.&quot;</P><P>The results of these analyses revealed large and abrupt temperature 
and salinity changes in the north-flowing warm current on time-scales of
 several decades to centuries. Cold ocean conditions were found to match
 periods of low solar energy output, corresponding to intervals of low 
sunspot activity observed on the surface of the sun. Using a 
physics-based <mark>climate</mark> model, the authors were able to test the response 
of the ocean to changes in the solar output and found similar results to
 the data.</P><P>&quot;By using the <mark>climate</mark> model it was also possible to explore how the 
changes in solar output affected the surface circulation of the Atlantic
 Ocean,&quot; said Prof Ian Hall, a co-author of the study. &quot;The circulation 
of the surface of the Atlantic Ocean is typically tightly linked to 
changes in the wind patterns. Analysis of the atmosphere component in 
the <mark>climate</mark> model revealed that during periods of solar minima there was
 a high-pressure system located west of the British Isles. This feature 
is often referred to as atmospheric blocking, and it is called this 
because it blocks the warm westerly winds diverting them and allowing 
cold Arctic air to flow south bringing harsh winters to Europe, such as 
those recently experienced in 2010 and 2013.&quot;</P><P>Meteorological studies have previously found similar effects of solar
 variability on the strength and duration of atmospheric winter 
blockings over the last 50 years, and although the exact nature of this 
relationship is not yet clear, it is thought to be due to complex 
processes happening in the upper layers of the atmosphere known as the 
stratosphere.</P><P>The study concludes that although the temperature changes expected 
from future solar activity are much smaller than the warming from human 
<mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions, regional <mark>climate</mark> variability associated with 
the effects of solar output on the ocean and atmosphere should be taken 
into account when making future <mark>climate</mark> projections.</P><P>Image 1: A composite created from three images received from MODIS

In 1989, there were 925. Last month, when Nestle announced that the workers in Purchase would be leaving by the end of this year, there were only 400.

Nestle USA, part of the world's largest food company, Nestle S.A. in Switzerland, was established in Westchester that year when two United States subsidiaries of Nestle S.A. opened executive offices in White Plains. The company later moved to larger quarters on Bloomingdale Road in White Plains and in 1977 to a new headquarters building on Manhattanville Road in Purchase.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""566"" data-total-count=""2820"">The move to Purchase was made possible only when the town of Harrison rezoned property owned by Manhattanville College, which it did after the state agreed to build a new exit and entrance from Manhattanville Road to Interstate 684 at a cost of $7 million. The road improvement diverted traffic from local Harrison streets and was a concession to keep Nestle in Westchester and in the state. Nestle acted in good faith, said a company spokesman, Linda Gavlick. &quot;At that time, Nestle had no thought of moving from Purchase. No one could foresee future consolidation.&quot;</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""425"" data-total-count=""3245"">As part of the restructuring, the Nestle Chocolate and Confection Company in Purchase became a part of a merged company called the Nestle Food Company. &quot;The move will unite the Nestle Chocolate and Confection Company in Purchase with the sales and distribution arms in Glendale,&quot; Ms. Gavlick said, &quot;so the business will be able to draw upon the resources and support groups of Nestle Food Company and Nestle USA in Glendale.&quot;</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""240"" data-total-count=""3485"">Mr. Schulman said the move was not surprising. &quot;What usually happens in such cases is that the new merged headquarters is close to the home of the larger sibling, which in this case was the former Carnation Company in Los Angeles,&quot; he said.</P><P class=""story-body-text story-content"" data-para-count=""276"" data-total-count=""3761"">Even as it departs, Nestle is keeping real estate ties to Westchester.

The rising demand is driving separate multi-million dollars investments in Nestle water bottling facility upgrades in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and France.</P><P>Switzer is a consultant who joined Nestle Waters in February 2016 after positions with PricewaterhouseCoopers, Centrica, and the Royal Bank of Canada. He's a vice president and the chief sustainability officer for Nestle Waters North America, the largest division of Nestle Waters global. His role is that of a strategist helping manage extraction of a precious resource that evokes passionate backlash in areas where the company operates.</P><P>Nestle Waters is on an unexpected bumpy road right now in Michigan, where it built a <A href=""http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/10/nestle_groundwater_pumping_exp.html"">$36 million expansion</A> of the Ice Mountain water bottling plant in Stanwood before securing crucial state permitting and <A href=""http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/06/nestle_osceola_twp_zba_appeal.html"">local zoning approvals</A> to extract more water. Nestle's quiet bid to increase capacity on what was originally an intermittently used backup well near Evart has startled Michiganders, many of whom are upset that Nestle can take that water without taxation while there's a <A href=""http://topics.mlive.com/tag/flint-water/"">drinking water crisis</A> happening in Flint.</P><P><A href=""http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2017/04/flint_water_crisis_casts_shado.html"" target=""_blank"" data-enhanced=""small"">Flint water crisis casts shadow on Nestle hearing</A></P><P>Switzer is highly polished and active on Twitter, where he's even posted pictures of himself drinking tap water to demonstrate Nestle's real interest in &quot;healthy-hydration,&quot; regardless of the source. His Twitter feed is a window into Nestle's environmentally focused marketing efforts; investments in projects like the Closed Loop Fund, a conglomerated $100 million plan to get more recycled material into manufacturing supply chains and the Alliance for Water Stewardship, a coordinated effort between global players like Nestle, Coca-Cola, McDonalds, Mars, Merck, Veolia, BASF and others to develop standardized water management policies.</P><P>Switzer said the Detroit meeting was one of dozens Nestle has or will host to gather input from academic, corporate and other thought leaders involved in water management. The meeting had the feel of a focus group, said some attendees, but without a clear agenda. Others likened it to a classic living room salon gathering, held, in this case around small plates at a new top-rated Midtown Detroit restaurant.</P><P>The dinner drew together a mix of seemingly strange bedfellows. In addition to Wayne State, the University of Michigan and Michigan State University, there were attendees from the Sierra Club, the Erb Family Foundation, Resource Recycling Systems, The Recycling Partnership, The Nature Conservancy's NatureVest, Rainforest Alliance and Dow Jones.</P><P>The purpose of the meeting, Switzer said, was &quot;to see if we can gain a better understanding of beliefs and thinking around water so we could generate new ideas, and see how we could all collaborate to ensure there's <mark>sustainable</mark> management of this precious natural resource.&quot; He declined to identify anyone in attendance or confirm specific discussion points, citing the Chatam House Rule, a British closed-door meeting system that offers participates a cloak of anonymity.</P><P>&quot;We had a very robust discussion,&quot; Switzer said. &quot;Nearly everybody at that table cooperated and expressed some really unique thoughts.&quot;</P><P>In a written statement issued after the meeting, a Wall Street Journal executive wrote to MLive: &quot;The Journal organized this dinner discussion -- a type of event common among newspapers -- to address a full range of issues and viewpoints about water sustainability. The Journal would not have participated if Nestle had controlled the programming.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Nestle and the public sector</STRONG></P><P>According to multiple guests who spoke to MLive, the evening featured big picture thinking about water value, pricing, distribution, need, access, security and rights models, all with an eye toward how those key issues might evolve as global water demand rises.</P><P>One guest said lots of talk circled around the idea of water as a service, not a product. Ultimately, Nestle doesn't really create what's in the bottles, it just moves it -- essentially putting the company in the delivery business. The image of water delivery isn't generally associated with Nestle, but it's not far-fetched. Nestle has agreements with FEMA to provide water for disaster relief. In Michigan, Nestle's nondescript water tanker trucks are a regular sight on the 38 miles of highway between Evart and Stanwood.</P><P>&quot;It's all wrapped up in the question of, 'Is water a right, a private or public resource, or a common resource,&quot; said the guest, a university member who declined to be named. &quot;What's the role of a private company in that? Is that evolving? Is there an evolving nature to their business model that they need to pay attention to?&quot;</P><P>Switzer talked of a desire to change public perception about water and embark on an international marketing campaign around its value, according to another guest who declined to be named. Community benefit agreements could be offered to localities, which Nestle would like to see invite the company in to partner on water distribution.</P><P>Those objectives line up closely with Nestle's stated goals to develop local public-private partnerships under the umbrella of a United Nations corporate water compact and global water partnerships under the World Economic Forum.</P><P>Under Nestle's &quot;water stewardship&quot; section on the company website, one of the company's goals by 2020 is to &quot;support the World Resources Institute (WRI) in the development of an open-source valuation methodology to determine the '<mark>Sustainable</mark> Cost of Water.'&quot;</P><P>On June 28, the company <A href=""http://www.nestleusa.com/media/pressreleases/clean-drinking-water-more-important-than-clean-air-to-americans"">released</A> the results of a private online survey of 6,699 American adults who expressed widespread concern about the reliability of U.S. drinking water infrastructure. The Nestle press release featured an image of Switzer under the quote, 'To secure a clean and abundant water future, we must collaborate.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>The elephant in the room</STRONG></P><P>John Erb, president of the Erb Family Foundation, which funds water quality projects in southeast Michigan, said he came away with the sense that &quot;Nestle is making an honest effort of trying to figure out how their business can be a <mark>sustainable</mark> business&quot; along the triple bottom line philosophy.</P><P>&quot;I walked away thinking there's just a lot more to the subject than is on the surface,&quot; Erb said.</P><P>At one point, Switzer was said have referred to the group as Nestle's 'brain trust.'&quot; Given the company's unpopularity in Michigan, some guests were circumspect or uncomfortable at being perceived as associated, even for a night, with the bottling giant.</P><P>Gail Philbin, director of Michigan's Sierra Club chapter, said the organization attended the dinner solely on a &quot;fact-finding mission.&quot; The group sent a local representative.</P><P>&quot;We were there to see what this global company is doing in Michigan and in no way support their agenda,&quot; Philbin said. &quot;In fact, we have issues with what they are doing.&quot;</P><P><A href=""http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/04/nestle_evart_wetlands_impact.html"" target=""_blank"" data-enhanced=""small"">More pumping could harm wetlands, suggests Nestle's own study</A></P><P>Ronald Hendrick, dean of Michigan State University College of Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources, said the phrase 'brain trust&quot; might have been used, but &quot;I didn't get the sense we were there in any sort of advisory capacity.&quot;</P><P>&quot;I frankly found most of the discussion fairly academic and philosophical as opposed to things I saw directly applicable to Nestle's business interest,&quot; Hendrick said. &quot;We didn't spend a lot of time talking about the ground or surface water withdrawals.&quot;</P><DIV id=""asset-23010291"" class=""entry_widget_full entry_widget_""><SPAN class=""adv-photo-full""><SPAN class=""photo-data""><SPAN class=""caption"">A map of Nestle's Michigan water system.</SPAN><SPAN class=""byline"">Katie Karnes | MLive</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></DIV><P>The lack of discussion about where Nestle actually gets water it sells amounted to a kind of elephant in the room that bothered Anna Boegehold, a doctoral candidate at Wayne State who joined Kashain when another guest couldn't attend.</P><P>Boegehold expressed what others termed &quot;politely negative&quot; feedback based on the position that water is a right, not a commodity.</P><P>She remembers the table dividing into camps: Those concerned about the economic value of water and those concerned about equitable access to it. The irony of a Nestle roundtable about water value in Detroit, a city in the middle of the world's largest freshwater ecosystem which is twisting the spigot shut on customers with delinquent accounts by the thousands this year, was not lost on some.</P><P>In that context, the crisis in Flint was also raised several times.</P><P>&quot;It seemed really disjointed,&quot; Boegehold said. &quot;They kept asking 'how much should water cost?'&quot; The question gave her an opportunity bring up Nestle's pending Michigan permit application to source more spring water for the Ice Mountain brand.</P><P>The company pays a $200 annual paperwork fee for its Michigan water extraction, which has topped four billion gallons since the company opened shop here in 2002.</P><P>Her feelings on that? &quot;If the state and Nestle are going to operate as business partners in that way, (Nestle) should pay a fair amount for the water and the state should take those funds and put them back into environmental programs.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Double down on bottled water</STRONG></P><P>Although Nestle is primarily a food company, water has become a major focus. In late June, <mark>Nestle SA</mark> announced plans for a $21 billion stock buyback in order to funnel  investments into &quot;high-growth food and beverage categories such as coffee, pet care, infant nutrition and bottled water.&quot; Bottled water sales in the U.S. and Canada brought $4.5 billion into the Nestle group in fiscal year 2016, according to the company's <A href=""http://www.nestle.com/asset-library/documents/library/documents/annual_reports/2016-annual-review-en.pdf"">annual report</A>.</P><P>As the bottled water market grows, the raw cost is expected to rise.</P><P>Switzer said Nestle pays what governments require, and that's starting to increase in some places. In Michigan, it pays the <A href=""http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/12/why_nestle_really_needs_more_m.html"">standard municipal rate</A> for water it buys from Evart city wells. But a few miles away, Nestle pays nothing to extract water from its White Pine Springs or Sanctuary Springs wells because Nestle owns them and state common law allows landowners the right to tap groundwater underneath their property, provided the pumping doesn't harm the environment or dry up neighboring wells.</P><P><A href=""http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/12/why_nestle_pays_next_to_nothin.html"" target=""_blank"" data-enhanced=""small"">Why Nestle pays next to nothing for Michigan groundwater</A></P><P>In Canada, Ontario is hiking the price of water for bottling from about $4 to $500 per million liters, (about 264,172 gallons), starting next August. Companies that extract more than 13,208 gallons per day must apply for a permit. Nestle has been at the center of debate in Ontario after it outbid a township for a drinking well and angered environmental groups by pumping water near Aberfoyle while the area was experiencing a drought.</P><P><A href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2017/04/03/nestle-pumps-water-national-forrest-without-paying-sparking-protest/99982518/"">In California</A>, Nestle is going through a similar public relations battle. Nestle has long piped water out of the San Bernardino National Forest for the Arrowhead Mountain spring brand, which it bought in the 1980s. Strong opposition to that developed during a California drought over the last few years. Like in Michigan, Nestle pays nothing for the spring water. That has prompted a lawsuit, investigation by state regulators and review of an annual $624 Forest Service permit that expired decades ago.</P><P>Switzer argues the company spends money to protect watersheds where it sources water in order to sustain its withdrawal in Michigan and other states, but <A href=""https://www.environmentalleader.com/2017/05/expect-cost-water-tomorrow-higher-today-qa-nestle-waters-nelson-switzer/"">admits</A> Nestle is expecting to pay more for water in the future overall.</P><P>In Michigan, there have been some quiet rumblings in Lansing about possible legislation to establish a fee on groundwater extraction, but nothing formal has been proposed.</P><P>In December, Switzer <A href=""http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/12/why_nestle_pays_next_to_nothin.html"">told MLive</A> that if Michigan decided to start charging water bottlers for extraction, Nestle would be &quot;very pleased to be able to sit down and discuss what pricing policy might make sense and how they could make sure the cost that would be levied would go toward the <mark>sustainable</mark> maintenance of the aquifer system.&quot;</P><P>In Michigan, the cost debate is being driven by the backlash, which experts say could be avoided if Nestle sourced water differently.</P><P>Robert Glennon, a water policy expert and law professor at the University of Arizona, said Nestle could probably avoid all the pushback by ditching spring water, found in brands like Ice Mountain, Ozarka, Zephyrhills, Deer Park, Poland Spring and Arrowhead.</P><P>&quot;We're not seeing the same pushback against Aquafina and Dasani,&quot; said Glennon, who was not at the Detroit dinner. &quot;It's against Nestle and the reason why is spring water. What seems pernicious to some people is they seem to be saying on one hand 'we're not going to impact the spring.' On the other hand, we're seeing them selling spring water.&quot;</P><P>&quot;It's very tough,&quot; he said, &quot;a bit like trying to square a circle.&quot;</P><P>Sourcing spring water is profitable but problematic for Nestle because, rather than pulling from a vast body like a Great Lake, selling spring water means that Nestle must pump from a shallow aquifer that connects to the surface -- greatly raising the potential for the withdrawal to impact local lakes, streams or wetlands.</P><P>So, while spring water extraction has a greater potential to negatively impact the environment, the company must show its extraction is <mark>sustainable</mark> by demonstrating there's enough rainfall to recharge the aquifer and offset the water which Nestle pumps are pulling out of the ground and bottling.</P><P>That's essentially the case the company is making in Michigan. Given its market potential, don't expect, regardless of all the green talk, Nestle to stop selling spring water.</P><P>&quot;Spring water is a product that consumers are demanding in droves,&quot; Switzer said. &quot;It's delicious and fresh and it's a healthy alternative to sugar-added drinks and sodas.&quot;</P><P><A href=""http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/12/inside_nestle_ice_mountain.html"" target=""_blank"" data-enhanced=""small"">How Michigan water becomes a product inside Nestle plant</A></P><P><STRONG>A consumptive use tax?</STRONG></P><P>Glennon called the notion of Nestle entering the public-private partnership arena &quot;very interesting&quot; because historic disinvestment in water infrastructure across the country, compounded by dwindling federal and state funds, has left cities like Flint trying to cover the cost of safe drinking water while facing a declining population and tax base. Nestle does bring significant resources to the table.</P><P>He called it a &quot;great idea&quot; for the state to tax large quantity water withdrawals like Nestle is proposing as a way to pay for drinking water infrastructure improvements, but said any tax should fall more heavily on &quot;consumptive&quot; uses, like water, beer and soda bottling, that remove the water from the watershed without replacing it.</P><P>&quot;I could see a state rule that had all large users pay a certain amount per gallon of water consumed, not simply diverted,&quot; Glennon said. &quot;When something like water is being used for private gain, the state has a right to expect to extract a tax on the use of this public resource.&quot;</P><P>A consumptive water use taxing scheme would likely exempt water used for <A href=""http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/08/michigan_water_use_data_analys.html"">power generation or industrial manufacturing</A> if it's returned, minus a few gallons, to the watershed immediately afterward, but not necessarily for agriculture because irrigation water taken up into crops is considered a consumptive use.</P><P>&quot;If it's a private well that's providing irrigation water for corn, or hay, or barley or hops for beer, that looks awfully similar to what Nestle is doing,&quot; Glennon said.</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Deforestation in Luang Prabang, Laos.</A></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class=""c-article__primary-content""><P>In an eco-twist on the Forbes 500, the UK-based think tank Global Canopy Programme has launched the <A href=""http://forest500.org"">Forest 500</A>, a ranking of how effectively companies and organizations are working to stop global deforestation. <A href=""https://www.treehugger.com/environmental-policy/stopping-tropical-deforestation-even-more-important-we-thought.html"">Stopping deforestation</A> has been identified as one of the cheapest and most effective means of fighting our current <mark>climate change</mark> trajectory. However, the issue is made complicated by a number of factors, such as the global <A href=""https://www.treehugger.com/green-food/5-consumer-products-linked-illegal-rainforest-destruction.html"">demand for tropical products as well as illegal activities</A>.</P><P>So, who’s doing the most to stop it? While well-intentioned consumers may seek to avoid products like palm oil and beef, the product chains that tie our food, paper and clothes to tropical forests are decidedly tangled.</P><P>That’s where Forest 500 steps in. The rankings look at companies, jurisdictions (countries and other economic regions like the E.U.), investors and other power brokers. To assess companies, the rankings take into account a number of factors, including reporting and transparency, operations, commodity policies, and overall forest policy (you can read more about the <A href=""http://forest500.org/about/methodology"">methodology here</A>).</P><P>A total of 250 companies were ranked, with just six companies scoring the maximum number of points for responsibly sourced forest products. In other words, the majority of companies aren’t making the grade, but a few leaders have emerged. With the exception of Reckitt Benckiser, all of the companies listed below are signatories of the <A href=""https://www.treehugger.com/environmental-policy/ambitious-plan-end-forest-loss-announced-un-<mark>climate</mark>-summit.html"">New York Declaration on Forests</A>, which aims to eliminate deforestation from the production of agricultural products by 2020, and stop all forms of deforestation by 2030.</P><P>The top scoring companies are listed below, in alphabetical order.</P><H2>1. Groupe Danone</H2><P>Risky commodities in this company’s supply chain include soy used as animal feed, pulp for its packaging and palm oil as an ingredient. However, the company got high marks for its commodity policies and operations.</P><H2>2. Kao Corp.</H2><P>Headquartered in Japan, this manufacturer owns John Frieda Hair Care, Molton Brown, Merries diapers and a number of other home and personal care brands. Wood pulp and palm oil are the two commodities in Kao Corp.’s product chain most closely associated with deforestation, but Forest 500 gives them high marks for their commodity policies, reporting and transparency. They got the highest score, five out of five, for their overall forest policy.</P><H2>3. Nestlé S.A.</H2><P>Nestlé may be best known for its chocolate, but it used 400,000 metric tons of palm oil and palm oil derivatives in its products in 2012-2013. <A href=""https://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/deforestation-victory-nestla-will-stop-using-rainforest-destroying-palm-oil.html"">Back in 2010</A>, the company committed to sourcing palm oil better. Forest 500 gave Nestlé high marks for its transparency, reporting and overall forest policy.</P><H2>4. Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</H2><P>Another personal care giant, Procter &amp; Gamble uses large amounts of palm oil and wood pulp in its products. The company has made public commitments to sourcing both sustainably, with verification from third party sources. Procter &amp; Gamble scored four out of five on its overall forest policies, but earned the highest marks for commodity policies, operations, reporting and transparency.</P><H2>5. Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC</H2><P>The owner of brands like Gaviscon, Clearasil, Veet and Lysol, Reckitt Benckiser is another company that’s concerned about the sourcing of palm oil and pulp. The company got the highest marks in all four of the Forest 500 assessment categories: overall forest policy, commodity policies, operations, reporting and transparency. Although Reckitt Benckiser did not sign the New York Declaration on forests, it is a member of the Consumer Goods Forum, which has committed to achieving net zero deforestation by 2020.</P><H2>6. Unilever PLC</H2><P>Unilever, the owner of brands like Axe and Dove, used 1.5 million metric tons of palm oil and its derivatives in 2012-2013, but 1.2 million of that was certified by the Roundtable on <mark>Sustainable</mark> Palm Oil. The company made commitments to <A href=""https://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/unilever-to-use-certified-<mark>sustainable</mark>-palm-oil.html"">a deforestation-free palm oil in 2008</A>. Its manufacturing facilities also consume an estimated 1 percent of the world’s soy, most of which comes from North America.</P><H2>A long way to go</H2><P>While it’s encouraging to see the above major multinational corporations take the issue of deforestation seriously, 30 companies evaluated by Forest 500 got the lowest rankings possible. In a press statement, Mario Rautner, The Global Canopy Programme’s Drivers of Deforestation Programme Manager, emphasized that there is still much work to be done to meet the goal of getting deforestation off the grocery store shelves. “Putting policies in place is just the necessary first step in addressing tropical deforestation and their implementation will be critical in order to transition to deforestation free supply chains by 2020,” he said.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Much of it is arid or semi-arid and the whole country is subject to droughts and floods. Even small variations in rainfall or temperatures would exacerbate this already stressed environment. Most South African crops are grown in areas that are only just climatically suitable and with limited water supplies.</P><P>But that <mark>climate</mark> is set to change for the worse because of rising global emissions of greenhouse gases. Indeed, there are already ominous signs of change – dry seasons are becoming longer and wet seasons starting later. Rainfall is reported to be becoming even more variable, with rain coming in more concentrated, violent bursts.</P><P>As the <mark>climate change</mark>s, it is South Africa’s poor, the majority of the population, who will be the hardest hit.  <mark>Climate change</mark> worsens existing vulnerabilities and adds to the pressures on the environment and natural resources on which so many South Africans directly rely. <mark>Climate change</mark> could increase the prevalence and distribution of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever and water-borne diseases such as cholera and dysentery. Such things mean that people living with HIV/AIDS in particular would experience increased risks.</P><P>South Africa has been playing an influential role as a developing country in international <mark>climate change</mark> negotiations even though it is not yet obliged to make commitments to reduce emissions. But South Africa is also part of the problem – the largest emitter of green house gases on the African continent and home to the world’s biggest single emitter of <mark>CO2</mark> (<A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasol"">Sasol</A>‘s Secunda plant, which converts coal to diesel and other fuels).</P><P>South Africa is faced with a difficult challenge in trying to juggle three imperatives – development (conventionally based on fossil fuels), poverty eradication and <mark>climate change</mark>. On the one hand, the country has to fast track provision of adequate transport, power, communication networks, water, sanitation and other infrastructure services. Much of this development implies that South Africa’s GHG emissions will increase. The provision of these services is essential to improving people’s well being and to reducing poverty.</P><P>On the other hand, conventional development as carried out in South Africa (like many other countries) has not focused on reducing poverty, will not reduce it by itself, and may sometimes exacerbate poverty and ill-health. And now South Africa also has to respond to the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> by reducing emissions and helping poor people adapt to the changing <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>Energy production is a particular concern. South Africa’s dependency on coal-fired power stations has already resulted in a yearly per capita emission rate of about 10 tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, 43 percent higher than the global average.  But despite extremely high per capita energy use, 30% of South African citizens do not have access to electricity.</P><P>So what needs to happen? To provide cleaner energy to all citizens equitably and effectively, South Africa needs to agree:</P><P>1. A moratorium on building further coal-fired plants
2. An immediate moratorium on any new coal-to-liquid plants.
3. The Treasury should institute its fossil fuel levy with immediate effect, revenue from this to be ring-fenced for Free Basic Electricity.
4. A staggered implementation of <mark>carbon</mark> taxation.
5. The provision of 1 million solar water heaters by 2020.
6. 15% of all electricity to come from renewable energy by 2020, and 50% by 2050.
7. Make energy efficiency in Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) housing a mandatory measure by 2015.
8. Invest in an efficient public transport system.
9. Promote gardening in urban and peri-urban areas and around homesteads.
10. Increase public awareness and promote behavioural change among consumers.</P><P>A year and a half ago, an official from the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT) stood up before a group of environmentalists and NGO representatives and pleaded, <EM>“Where is the environmental movement? Where are the placards? We can’t change things without the pressure of citizens.” </EM>At the end of 2009, the governments of the world will meet to decide our collective fate at the UN <mark>climate change</mark> conference at Copenhagen; they have this one chance. Perhaps we should remind them just exactly who they are working for.’</P><P><EM>Update: Nearly ten years later (2018), this post still regularly appears as one of the most-read on FP2P – could someone tell me who is recommending it?</EM></P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

A hot, dry El Niño <A href=""https://www.<mark>climate</mark>.gov/enso""><mark>climate</mark> pattern</A> that swept across southern Africa made 2015 the <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-drought-idUSKCN0US14T20160114"">driest year on record</A> in South Africa. 2016 offered <A href=""http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/2016/09/08/SA-drought-not-broken-after-driest-year-in-history1"">little respite </A>until late spring, when the heavens opened and crops were able to recover.</P><P>That was supposed to make this year especially successful for corn farmers, who produced the biggest crop on record in South Africa’s history, according to the <A href=""http://www.daff.gov.za/docs/Cropsestimates/Media%20May%202017.pdf"">country’s agriculture department</A> (pdf). At an estimated 15 million tons, the crop is 101% bigger than last year’s harvest (which was the smallest in almost 10 years). That translates to about 5,000 tons more than South Africa needs each year.</P><P>But instead of celebrating, most farmers will now look to recover from the damage wrought by the last few years. The record drought and <A href=""http://www.iol.co.za/business-report/markets/commodities/sa-will-continue-maize-imports-7509400"">fears of food shortages</A> pushed the price of maize to more than 5000 rand ($392) per ton last year. Whatever profit that was generated by that high price was likely quickly wiped out, as many already indebted farmers relied on new debt to get seeds into field.</P><P>At the same time, the South African rand reached record new lows against the dollar at the end of 2015, forcing farmers to pay hiked up prices on imported machinery, fertilizers, and agrochemicals.</P><P>Farmers have little power to influence the maize prices set at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange—they’re “a price taker, not maker” explains Wandile Sihlobo, head agri-economist at South Africa’s <A href=""http://www.agbiz.co.za/"">Agricultural Business Chamber.</A> This year, due to the bumper crop, the price has been set at 1,800 rand ($140) per ton. That means farmers who spent about 8,000 rand ($626) per hectare on their input costs may make about 10,000 rand ($783) thanks to the bumper crop. That will mostly go towards transportation, post-production costs, and debt repayment, says Sihlobo, leaving little over to regroup.</P><P>South Africa’s farmers seem to be increasingly caught between mercurial markets and volatile weather in the age of <mark>climate change</mark>. Increasing automation and the country’s <A href=""https://mg.co.za/article/2017-06-07-sas-in-a-recession-heres-what-that-means"">recent slide into recession</A> likely won’t help.</P><P><EM><A href=""https://qz.com/newsletters/africa-weekly-brief/"" target=""_blank"">Sign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief</A>— the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.</EM></P><DIV class=""article-aside""><ASIDE class=""popular-stories-module""><ARTICLE><H4 class=""module-title"">Most Popular</H4></ARTICLE></ASIDE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Studies show that we are using 10% more water than is <mark>sustainable</mark> in the long term and that this gap is expected to widen with the growth of the global population, with prosperity and urbanisation.</P><P>Availability of and access to water matters for Nestle on many levels: our farmers need water to grow raw materials for our products; we need water in our factories to process these raw materials, e.g., as a solvent and for cleaning and hygiene in general; and consumers need safe water to prepare many of our products.</P><P>Underlying all this, water is essential for the survival of humankind; <STRONG>water is a human right</STRONG>.</P><P>Too many of us, however, take water for granted and do not attribute any value to it, despite the fact that it is the by far most valuable resource we have.</P><P><STRONG>Nestlé almost single-handedly created and established the concept of Creating Shared Value. It is now an important part of Nestlé’s DNA. </STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Can you please elaborate on creating shared value and how it can improve water and wastewater management practices and processes?</STRONG></P><P>We have just published our <A href=""http://www.nestle.com/asset-library/documents/library/documents/annual_reports/2013-annual-report-en.pdf"" target=""_blank"">2013 Annual Report</A> as well as our annual Nestlé in Society report. This explains the concept of Creating Shared Value (CSV) and what it means for us: it is our fundamental belief that for our company to be successful in the long term and to create value for our shareholders, it must also create value for society. Now, this is not a new kind of ‘DNA’ for the company; it is a concept that has its roots firmly in the - almost - 150 years of Nestlé’s life history.</P><P>In CSV, we at Nestlé focus on three areas: nutrition, rural development and water. The approach is action-oriented and fully transparent. For each area, we have defined clear commitments and we report on our progress. With respect to water, our approach centres on water use efficiency, effective water treatment (by the way, the first wastewater treatment plant in the Nestlé Group was built in the 1930s) and engaging with suppliers, particularly farmers, to help them make their agricultural processes less water intensive.</P><P>But corporate initiatives alone will not bring about the changes needed to really tackle the challenge of water. Our fourth pillar within the water CSV-strategy is, therefore, advocacy for effective water policies in individual watersheds.</P><P>Water is a local issue, there are no global solutions; at the same time, it is a horizontal and complex issue for which isolated piece-meal actions will have little or no effect. Indeed, once the problem of overdraft in a watershed has been identified, the active co-operation of all stakeholders is needed - in a context of strong government leadership. This is the approach taken by the 2030 Water Resources Group which I chair.</P><P>Water must be used more efficiently and we need to make it clear that this is an urgent issue that has to be tackled now. One of the key risks is for our supply of food– 70% of all freshwater withdrawn for human use goes to agriculture and more than 90% of water actually used is to grow crops. If we don’t find comprehensive and cost-effective solutions very soon, the water overdraft in major cereal-producing regions may lead to a major food crisis in the world.</P><P><STRONG>How is this <EM>2030 Water Resources Group</EM> initiative different and can new partners be integrated in its efforts?</STRONG></P><P>2030 Water Resources Group is an innovative public-private partnership involving the private sector, civil society organisations, the World Bank Group, three regional development banks and several governmental development organisations. The group has a global view, but acts locally. It provides information and advice for governments to set coherent strategies in countries and watersheds, taking a disruptive approach that aims to overcome the various political and ideological rigidities often found in solutions to water overuse.</P><P>We are constantly looking for new partners, particularly at the local level and on the business side. Wherever we are active, we are building up or extending multi-stakeholder groups: Peru, Mexico, South Africa, Tanzania, Jordan, Mongolia, India (Karnataka) and possibly Lebanon, Bangladesh and Kenya.</P><P><STRONG>Water becomes an important component of the national political agenda when there are serious floods, prolonged droughts or natural disasters. In between, it often vanishes from the political agenda. As the Singapore experience shows, for water management and national water security to improve, water must remain a high priority on the political agenda. </STRONG></P><P><STRONG>What can be done to prioritize water on the political agenda?  </STRONG></P><P>Water-related issues are complex – they involve numerous uses and users, problems of overdraft, problems of quality - and all aspects overlap. Further complexity arises out of the political, societal, environmental and even spiritual aspects of water. So water-related issues represent a major challenge that, in a first stage, require communication based on the clear identification of all the issues involved and their causes.</P><P>In order to keep water high on the political agenda, we then need alignment on priorities. At the end of 2012, I was invited, as a ‘business ambassador’, to provide input to the UN Secretary General on water-related post 2015 UN Development Goals.</P><P>I proposed that water be included as a stand-alone goal<STRONG>, </STRONG>with four key targets, all of which would require a joint effort on the part of all stakeholders under the leadership of governments:</P><P>1) <STRONG>Universal access to safe drinking water </STRONG>by 2025 at the latest, with a parallel focus beyond 2025 on the quality of water, taking us from a focus on “improved” water to a focus on “truly safe drinking water”. Water for survival is a human right! Moreover, I stressed the importance of looking for ways to implement this goal; declarations are never enough. A key issue here that would need to be addressed is finding agreement across governments and stakeholders on the amount of water any individual who cannot pay should be able to access at zero cost. This amount must be set such that it  can be provided within the current financial resources of municipalities.</P><P>2) <STRONG>Improved sanitation</STRONG>. Accelerate the provision of access to improved sanitation to at least 120 million additional people per year, aiming for universal access before 2050. Data on actual improvements achieved to date show that this is realistically possible and, with strengthened efforts, I am convinced that political leaders can set themselves more ambitious targets.</P><P>3) <STRONG>Adequate treatment of all municipal and industrial wastewater prior to discharge</STRONG> by 2030. There is a need to introduce best practice initiatives to reduce groundwater <mark>pollution</mark> from agricultural production.</P><P>4) <STRONG>Address the water overdraft. </STRONG> If we don’t change the way we are using water today, we put all the three targets mentioned above at risk. The nexus discussion – water-food-energy – moreover demonstrates that water shortages will become a choke point for economies, particularly for those economies which are today moving out of widespread poverty. Even worse, and as mentioned above, we risk shortfalls of up to 30% of global cereal production due to water scarcity by 2030.  In sum, we have to bring freshwater withdrawals (for all uses) back into line with <mark>sustainable</mark> supply (natural renewal minus environmental flows), watershed by watershed.</P><P>This fourth target is clearly relevant for the first three. We need to use water more efficiently and we need to make it clear that the water challenge is urgent and must be tackled now.</P><P><STRONG>What are the water-related messages you would like to convey to the participants of the Singapore International Water Week? </STRONG></P><P>I would like to invite all participants to reach out to non-specialists; those who come to the Singapore International Water Week know the problems surrounding water and know how to address them. But this knowledge has to be shared. There are many ways to do this; one that I have decided to focus on is my personal water blog – <A href=""http://www.water-challenge.org/"" target=""_blank"">www.Water-Challenge.org</A>. Most of my readers are interested citizens and stakeholders from a diverse set of backgrounds; they are not necessarily part of the specialist water community. So I would like to invite input and comments on my blog from participants in the Singapore Water Week. Needless to say, there are many more ways to reach out and I welcome any thoughts and ideas in this regard. My second message to you: please support ongoing efforts to include a water-related goal in the post-2015 UN Development Goals. Since awareness of the challenges and of the solutions is not, by itself, enough, we must align and focus on clearly defined targets such as those I proposed above.</P><P> </P><H3>
