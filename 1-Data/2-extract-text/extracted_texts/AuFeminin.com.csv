However, continued growth of the technology will require it to step outside the bedrooms and home-offices of its current user base - tech and gaming enthusiasts. There are multiple reasons - both on a practical and metaphorical level - that this shift will be necessary. </P><P>To begin with, many VR experiences require space for the user to move around. Some even require motion or action. Often - not always, but <EM>often </EM>- these kinds of physical actions can be inconvenient, difficult or outright impossible to perform in the kinds of office spaces where VR-capable PCs usually reside. As the software and hardware involved evolves, it’ll become more and more difficult to get away with squeezing VR experiences into an office or study.</P><P>Bringing VR out of these spaces will serve to help it attract the new audiences it needs to continue growing. There are plenty of potential VR users who are either turned off by how ‘out of reach’ or ‘out of touch’ virtual reality experiences can sometimes appear. As with more-traditional console gaming experiences, moving VR from a private space to a common one will serve to gradually shift attitudes towards the technology.</P><P>In order for it to grow further and truly embrace its mainstream potential, VR is going to have to make the jump to the living room. In addition, given the technical demands required for high-end virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, high-end PCs are going to have to make that journey as well. Of course, in order for them to do so, they’ll have to become smaller. New form factors - like that found in the MSI Vortex G25 - will be needed.
  </P><H3>New Form-Factors Are Needed</H3><P>In the past, there’s been a clear divide between the slim and sleek designs of home consoles like the Playstation and Xbox and the lumbering towers of PC space. The idea that bigger equals better (performance) has been reinforced at every turn. However, these kinds of form-factors aren’t going to play as well in a living-room setting.</P><P>When it comes to these sorts of common areas, it’s more desirable to have your entertainment kit play quietly play nice together than have any single part of it become the center of attention. To this end, VR-ready PCs are going to have to adapt to their surroundings - and learn to fit in.</P><P>Such adaptations can already be seen in the MSI Vortex G25. The Vortex weighs just 2.5kg and features a set of VESA mount slots. This means that you can attach it to the back of a monitor or TV, further reducing the physical footprint of the PC within your living room to something that’s almost or completely out of sight. Even if you don’t make use of the VESA mount, the compact and slim form-factor of the Vortex G25 means it is easy to set up, pack away between use or move around to best suit your living room.   </P><H3>More Than Just Good Looks</H3><P>Regardless, how your PC looks are only really going to matter if it comes ready to meet technical expectations. In terms of how powerful these living room PCs are going to need to be, the Vortex G25 again acts as a strong example. VR experiences require a lot of graphical grunt and processing power and the Vortex G25 is poised to deliver, courtesy of eight-gen Intel i7 processors and Nvidia GeForce 1070 graphics.</P><P>For similar reasons, VR-ready PCs designed for the living room will also need to incorporate the best possible cooling solutions. Technologies like the Cooler Boost tech featured in many MSI products will become more and more prominent. The most-advanced version of this feature - Cooler Boost Titan - incorporates 15 heat pipes and multiple dedicated fans, allowing users to achieve the best possible performance without compromise. It can be found in both the Vortex G25 and the GT83VR gaming laptop.</P><P>What’s more, unlike similar ultra-compact gaming PCs, the Vortex G25 has been designed to be upgraded (tool-free!) over the long term. This is important because, over time, VR is inevitably going to get both more advanced and more technically-demanding. In such circumstances, being able to upgrade your living room PC becomes more than just a perk - it’s all but going to be required.   </P><H3>The Bottom Line</H3><P>We’ve always thought of gaming PCs as these big bulky boxes or towers. However, with the rate at which technology is advancing, these might soon seem as antiquated and old-fashioned as computers from the 60s and 70s do today.</P><P>Virtual reality is set to be big. However, before it gets big, it’s going to have to move to outside of the office - and PCs like the Vortex G25, which deliver the optimal blend of portability and power required for this, are likely along for the ride.</P><P>

All the written essays are very simple and easy in order to help students. Our written essays proves some questions like background of issue, effect of <mark>climate change</mark> over people’s lives and relation of <mark>climate change</mark> to global warming.</P><H3>Global Warming and <mark>Climate Change</mark> Essay 1 (100 words)</H3><P>The whole <mark>climate</mark> of the world is changing regularly because of the increasing global warming by the natural means and human activities. All the changes have an enormous impact on the people’s lives and ecosystems. The average global temperature has been raised by 1 degree in the last 30 years. It has been reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) that average global temperature can be raised by 2 to 8.6 degrees F by 2100. The rate in increasing global temperature is because of the increasing emissions of heat-trapping gases called green house gases in the atmosphere.</P><H3>Global Warming and <mark>Climate Change</mark> Essay 2 (150 words)</H3><P><mark>Climate change</mark> on the earth is partially takes place by the natural cycles of Earth however currently human activities are still major source of <mark>climate change</mark>. Increasing level of greenhouse gases including <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide brings more heat to the earth as they have ability to absorb and emit heat in the atmosphere and thus keep earth warm. Some of the dangerous human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, technological inventions, etc are adding more toxic greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. All the greenhouse gases make temperature of earth to increase at higher rate which is not in the favour of life of human beings, animal and plants.</P><P>A huge level of <mark>climate change</mark> disturbs the balance of the global ecosystem as well as increases health risks and more heat-related injuries and deaths. Rising sea levels is a also an example of <mark>climate change</mark> due to the global warming which in turn causes flood, drought, promotes danger of malaria and other parasites.</P><H3>Global Warming and <mark>Climate Change</mark> Essay 3 (200 words)</H3><P>There are many reasons of <mark>climate change</mark> including natural cycles of earth however the major contributors of the <mark>climate change</mark> is global warming. Many human activities and technological development in the world are forcing the greenhouse gases to increase and getting collected to the atmosphere which in turn makes the earth surrounding hot and warm by increasing the temperature of the environment in fast and easy way. Other <mark>climate change</mark> like rise sea level causes flood which gives rise to malaria and other parasites, increasing coastal erosion, destroying people’s homes in coastal states and so many.</P><P>Higher temperature causes problems to the existence of life on this planet even many important species of the plants and animals have been endangered. Longer and severe heat waves of the environment cause more heat-related injuries and higher atmospheric temperature increase rate of water evaporation from smaller water bodies. The ever rising temperature has different effects in different regions like in some areas it raise water levels and in some areas it decrease water levels. Freshwater availability is declining all over the world which is a vital resource of life on this planet. In such a hot environment, it is very hard to grow some crops like corn production may reduced by 10 to 30% if the temperature rises by 3.6 degree Fahrenheit.</P><H3>Global Warming and <mark>Climate Change</mark> Essay 4 (250 words)</H3><P>Climatic changes have become more prominent now because of the global warming which is a global concern. Both are hot issues of the current time and it is the time to analyse causes and prevention methods to prevent the global warming. The release of various green house gases in the atmosphere by many natural means and human activities causes increase in atmospheric temperature because such gases have capability to absorb all the heat of environment from sun, burning coal, etc. Such gases never let sun rays to go back to the atmosphere however trap heat from them.</P><P>Increase in atmospheric temperature causes many <mark>climate change</mark>s like increase in sea level, flood, drought, weather changes, increase summer season, decrease winter season, melting glaciers, increase death rate, increase number of disease, declining ozone layer and other so many <mark>climate change</mark>s. Fossil fuels burning release more <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide which is increasing day by day because of deforestation. Plants are the main source to utilize <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide as a food however we are disturbing the natural cycle by cutting more plants.</P><P>Burning coal, oil and natural gases are the main cause of global warming. <mark>CO2</mark> gas acts as a blanket which retains environmental heat and warms the earth’s surface. The level of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide has become increased to a great level in last century. The earth surface has become successively warmer than ever in the last three decades. Each month is becoming warmer than ever which we can feel very clearly. This increasing heat affecting the lives of human beings, plants and animals even many species have been endangered.</P><H3>Global Warming and <mark>Climate Change</mark> Essay 5 (300 words)</H3><P>There are many reasons behind <mark>climate change</mark>, some are natural and some are human activities. <mark>Climate change</mark> is not area or region specific, it s changing all through the world. <mark>Climate change</mark> occurs when atmospheric temperatures increase a lot which in turn causes many different changes to the earth such as more floods, intense rain, droughts, increase in rate of more frequent and severe heat waves, increase level of oceans, melting glaciers, warming oceans, sea water becoming more acidic, and so many. All these changes may become more frequent in the future decades and hugely challenge the society and environment.</P><P>In the few past centuries, human activities have increased the release of large amounts of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide including other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Most of the green house gases come from burning fossil fuels which work as blanket around the earth and trap all the energy and heat available in the atmosphere and thus warm the earth surface. This effect is called as the greenhouse effect which triggers <mark>climate</mark> to change to the huge level and result in dangerous effects to the lives and ecosystems. Such a warmer <mark>climate</mark> affects the availability of natural water supplies, crop production, agriculture, natural environment, safety, security, etc. Such huge <mark>climate change</mark>s are unavoidable however cannot be stopped at once.</P><P>Global warming has really affected and forced the <mark>climate</mark> to change over the last century throughout the world. Unusual increase in the earth’s average temperature is because of the high amount of greenhouse gases release due to burning fossil fuels and other human activities. Some of the green house gases having more influence on the <mark>climate</mark> are <mark>CO2</mark>, water vapour, dinitrogen-oxide, and methane. According to the research, it has been recorded that almost 30 percent of the heat by incoming sunlight gets reflected back to the space through clouds and ice but because of global warming ice are melting. It means there are no left sources to send heat back to the space and all are getting collected in the earth atmosphere and affecting the <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P> </P><H3>Global Warming and <mark>Climate Change</mark> Essay 6 (400 words)</H3><P>A huge level <mark>climate change</mark> in the current time attracts the people’s attention very easily. Every one of us is feeling very clearly from the short-term changes in the seasonal patterns of temperature, drought, rainfall without season, changing weather patterns, etc to the long-term changes affecting the entire earth. <mark>Climate</mark> is a long-term weather trend affecting human lives positively or negatively. <mark>Climate change</mark> is the long term variations in the weather patterns. <mark>Climate</mark> itself adjusts time to time however going at wrong path since many years because of regular loss of huge ice sheets. Earlier the earth atmosphere was covered with ice sheets which were able to make the earth atmosphere cool by preventing earth from heat and sending back extra heat out of the space from the earth.</P><P><mark>Climate</mark> has changed from cooler to warmer over the last two million years in the cyclical manner. Sun is the ultimate source of heat energy which fuelling the weather systems after reaching to the earth. Earlier the harsh and extended bitter cold season was called as the little ice age which was due to the huge level variations in the solar activity. It is found that the positive human activities may play major roles in shaping earth’s <mark>climate</mark>. Such a huge variations in the <mark>climate</mark> may lead to the danger of the human lives. Earlier it was believed that shifts in the <mark>climate</mark> pattern from ice age to warmer periods was because of time however later it was imagined that it is due to regular melting of ice sheets of more than a kilometre in thickness. Our <mark>climate</mark> is getting warm rapidly by the rate of approximately 8°C over the course of 10 years.</P><P>A huge industrial revolution in the modern time has largely impacted the global <mark>climate</mark> system by increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere. Heat trapping nature of the green house gases contributes to the global warming. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC), the increase in earth’s average surface temperature by 20<SUP>th</SUP> century has been approximately 0.6°C. It has also been recorded in the northern hemisphere over the last century that there is decrease in snow cover by 10 percent, decrease in spring and summer sea-ice by 10-15 percent, increases in rainfall and its intensity, huge level change in shifts of ice freezes and breaks up in the rivers and lakes.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The industrial sector plays a significant role in China's economic growth and <mark>CO2</mark> emissions. This is the first study to present a specific investigation on the retrospective decomposition (1993–2014) and prospective trajectories (2015–2035) of China's industrial <mark>CO2</mark> emission intensity (ICEI) and industrial <mark>CO2</mark> emissions (ICE), aiming at China Industrial Green Development Plan 2016–2020 targets and China's 2030 <mark>CO2</mark> emission-reduction targets. We introduce process <mark>carbon</mark> intensity, investment and R&amp;D factors into the decomposition model and make a combination of dynamic Monte Carlo simulation and scenario analysis to identify whether and how the targets would be realized from a sector-specific perspective. The results indicate that investment intensity is the primary driver for the increase in ICEI, while R&amp;D intensity and energy intensity are the leading contributors to the reduction in ICEI. Under existing policies, it is very possible for the industrial sector to achieve the 2020 and 2030 intensity-reduction targets. However, the realization of 2030 emission-peak target has some uncertainties and needs extra efforts in efficiency improvement and structural adjustment. All the five scenarios would achieve the 2020 and 2030 intensity-reduction targets, except Scenario N4 for China Industrial Green Development Plan 2016–2020 target. Nonetheless, only three scenarios would realize the 2030 emission-peak target. With strong efficiency improvement and structural adjustment, ICE would hit the peak in 2025. In contrast, with high/low efficiency improvement and weak structural adjustment, ICE would fail to reach the peak before 2035. Both ICEI and ICE have substantial mitigation potentials with the enhancement of efficiency improvement and structural adjustment. Finally, we suggest that the Chinese government should raise the baseline requirements of efficiency improvement and structural adjustment for the industrial sector to achieve China’s 2030 targets.</DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

You may choose to submit your manuscript as a single Word or PDF file to be used in the refereeing process.

The journal interprets global environmental change to mean the outcome of processes that are manifest in localities, but with consequences at multiple spatial, temporal and socio-political scales. The journal is interested in articles which have a significant social science component. These include articles that address the social drivers or consequences of environmental change, or social and policy processes that seek to address problems of environmental change. Topics include, but are not restricted to, the drivers, consequences and management of changes in: biodiversity and ecosystem services, <mark>climate</mark>, coasts, food systems, land use and land cover, oceans, urban areas, and water resources. </P><P> Articles should be no longer than 8,000 words (including main body text, table and figure captions but not including references), although longer articles will be accepted on an occasional basis, if the topic demands this length of treatment.</P><P> GEC has a strong preference for empirical papers and will only consider theory or review papers where they make a considerable advance to knowledge and are extremely novel. </P><P><STRONG>Special Issue Guidelines:</STRONG><EM>GEC is not currently accepting Special Issue proposals.

Examples of potential conflicts of interest include employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, paid expert testimony, patent applications/registrations, and grants or other funding. Authors must disclose any interests in two places: 1. A summary declaration of interest statement in the title page file (if double-blind) or the manuscript file (if single-blind). If there are no interests to declare then please state this: 'Declarations of interest: none'. This summary statement will be ultimately published if the article is accepted. 2. Detailed disclosures as part of a separate Declaration of Interest form, which forms part of the journal's official records. It is important for potential interests to be declared in both places and that the information matches. <A href=""http://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/286/supporthub/publishing"">More information</A>.</P><P><STRONG>Submission declaration and verification</STRONG>Submission of an article implies that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract, a published lecture or academic thesis, see '<A href=""https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/policies-and-ethics"">Multiple, redundant or concurrent publication</A>' for more information), that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, including electronically without the written consent of the copyright-holder.

The system automatically converts your files to a single PDF file, which is used in the peer-review process. The guidelines for submission below are the same whether you are submitting a research or perspective article </P><P><STRONG>TYPES OF ARTICLES</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Research articles </STRONG>present original research and are up to 8,000 words in length (including main body text, table and figure captions but not including references), although longer articles will be accepted on an occasional basis, if the topic demands this length of treatment. We occasionally accept review-style pieces under the research article category but the bar is set very high - submissions must add new insights and go significantly beyond a review of the existing literature. </P><P><STRONG>Perspective articles </STRONG>provide an opportunity for authors to present a novel or distinctive viewpoint on any subject within the journal's scope, with a strong focus on current advances and future directions. Perspective articles should be well grounded in evidence and adequately supported by citations as necessary, but should be forward-looking and provide a stimulating and thought-provoking line of argument that advances in thinking or debate about the human dimensions of global environmental change. Perspectives should not exceed 3,000 words.&quot;</P><P><STRONG><EM>References</EM></STRONG>There are no strict requirements on reference formatting at submission. References can be in any style or format as long as the style is consistent. Where applicable, author(s) name(s), journal title/book title, chapter title/article title, year of publication, volume number/book chapter and the pagination must be present. Use of DOI is highly encouraged. The reference style used by the journal will be applied to the accepted article by Elsevier at the proof stage. Note that missing data will be highlighted at proof stage for the author to correct.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Formatting requirements</EM></STRONG>There are no strict formatting requirements but all manuscripts must contain the essential elements needed to convey your manuscript, for example Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Conclusions, Artwork and Tables with Captions.If your article includes any Videos and/or other Supplementary material, this should be included in your initial submission for peer review purposes.Divide the article into clearly defined sections.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Figures and tables embedded in text</EM></STRONG>Please ensure the figures and the tables included in the single file are placed next to the relevant text in the manuscript, rather than at the bottom or the top of the file. The corresponding caption should be placed directly below the figure or table.</P><P><STRONG>Peer review</STRONG>This journal operates a double blind review process. All contributions will be initially assessed by the editor for suitability for the journal. Papers deemed suitable are then typically sent to a minimum of two independent expert reviewers to assess the scientific quality of the paper. The Editor is responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles. The Editor's decision is final. <A href=""https://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/what-is-peer-review"">More information on types of peer review</A>.</P><P><STRONG>Double-blind review</STRONG>This journal uses double-blind review, which means the identities of the authors are concealed from the reviewers, and vice versa. <A href=""https://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/what-is-peer-review"">More information</A> is available on our website. To facilitate this, please include the following separately:<EM>Title page (with author details):</EM> This should include the title, authors' names, affiliations, acknowledgements and any Declaration of Interest statement, and a complete address for the corresponding author including an e-mail address.<EM>Blinded manuscript (no author details):</EM> The main body of the paper (including the references, figures, tables and any acknowledgements) should not include any identifying information, such as the authors' names or affiliations.</P><P><STRONG>REVISED SUBMISSIONS</STRONG></P><P><STRONG><EM>Use of word processing software</EM></STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Please use correct, continuous line numbering and page numbering throughout the document.</STRONG></P><P> It is important that the file be saved in the native format of the word processor used. The text should be in single-column format. Keep the layout of the text as simple as possible. Most formatting codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. In particular, do not use the word processor's options to justify text or to hyphenate words. However, do use bold face, italics, subscripts, superscripts etc. When preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for each individual table and not a grid for each row. If no grid is used, use tabs, not spaces, to align columns. The electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of conventional manuscripts (see also the Guide to Publishing with Elsevier: <A href=""http://www.elsevier.com/guidepublication"">http://www.elsevier.com/guidepublication</A>). Note that source files of figures, tables and text graphics will be required whether or not you embed your figures in the text. See also the section on Electronic artwork. To avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the 'spell-check' and 'grammar-check' functions of your word processor.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Use of word processing software</EM></STRONG>Regardless of the file format of the original submission, at revision you must provide us with an editable file of the entire article.

The electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of conventional manuscripts (see also the <A href=""https://www.elsevier.com/guidepublication"">Guide to Publishing with Elsevier</A>).

To avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the 'spell-check' and 'grammar-check' functions of your word processor.</P><P><STRONG>Article structure</STRONG></P><P><STRONG><EM>Subdivision - numbered sections</EM></STRONG>Divide your article into clearly defined and numbered sections. Subsections should be numbered 1.1 (then 1.1.1, 1.1.2, ...), 1.2, etc. (the abstract is not included in section numbering). Use this numbering also for internal cross-referencing: do not just refer to 'the text'. Any subsection may be given a brief heading. Each heading should appear on its own separate line.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Introduction</EM></STRONG>State the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background, avoiding a detailed literature survey or a summary of the results.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Material and methods</EM></STRONG>Provide sufficient details to allow the work to be reproduced by an independent researcher. Methods that are already published should be summarized, and indicated by a reference. If quoting directly from a previously published method, use quotation marks and also cite the source. Any modifications to existing methods should also be described.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Theory/calculation</EM></STRONG>A Theory section should extend, not repeat, the background to the article already dealt with in the Introduction and lay the foundation for further work. In contrast, a Calculation section represents a practical development from a theoretical basis.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Results</EM></STRONG>Results should be clear and concise.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Discussion</EM></STRONG>This should explore the significance of the results of the work, not repeat them. A combined Results and Discussion section is often appropriate. Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published literature.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Conclusions</EM></STRONG>The main conclusions of the study may be presented in a short Conclusions section, which may stand alone or form a subsection of a Discussion or Results and Discussion section.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Appendices</EM></STRONG>If there is more than one appendix, they should be identified as A, B, etc. Formulae and equations in appendices should be given separate numbering: Eq. (A.1), Eq. (A.2), etc.; in a subsequent appendix, Eq. (B.1) and so on. Similarly for tables and figures: Table A.1; Fig. A.1, etc.</P><P><STRONG>Essential title page information</STRONG>•<EM><STRONG>Title.</STRONG></EM> Concise and informative. Titles are often used in information-retrieval systems. Please avoid the use of acronyms, abbreviations, formular or chemical symbols in the title - these should appear in the full form e.g. '<mark>CO2</mark>' should appear as '<mark>carbon</mark> dioxide'.•<EM><STRONG>Author names and affiliations.</STRONG></EM> Where the family name may be ambiguous (e.g., a double name), please indicate this clearly. Present the authors' affiliation addresses (where the actual work was done) below the names. Indicate all affiliations with a lower-case superscript letter immediately after the author's name and in front of the appropriate address. Provide the full postal address of each affiliation, including the country name, and, if available, the e-mail address of each author.•<EM><STRONG>Corresponding author.</STRONG></EM> Clearly indicate who will handle correspondence at all stages of refereeing and publication, also post-publication. <STRONG>Ensure that telephone and fax numbers (with country and area code) are provided in addition to the e-mail address and the complete postal address. Contact details must be kept up to date by the corresponding author.</STRONG>•<EM><STRONG>Present/permanent address.</STRONG></EM> If an author has moved since the work described in the article was done, or was visiting at the time, a &quot;Present address&quot; (or &quot;Permanent address&quot;) may be indicated as a footnote to that author's name. The address at which the author actually did the work must be retained as the main, affiliation address. Superscript Arabic numerals are used for such footnotes.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Abstract</EM></STRONG>A concise and factual abstract is required. The abstract should state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results and major conclusions. An abstract is often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand alone. For this reason, references should be avoided, but if essential, then cite the author(s) and year(s). Please avoid the use of acronyms, abbreviations, formulae or chemical symbols in the abstract - these should appear in their full form e.g. '<mark>CO2</mark>' should appear as '<mark>carbon</mark> dioxide'. If essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Graphical abstract</EM></STRONG>Although a graphical abstract is optional, its use is encouraged as it draws more attention to the online article. The graphical abstract should summarize the contents of the article in a concise, pictorial form designed to capture the attention of a wide readership. Graphical abstracts should be submitted as a separate file in the online submission system. Image size: Please provide an image with a minimum of 531 × 1328 pixels (h × w) or proportionally more. The image should be readable at a size of 5 × 13 cm using a regular screen resolution of 96 dpi. Preferred file types: TIFF, EPS, PDF or MS Office files. You can view <A href=""https://www.elsevier.com/graphicalabstracts"">Example Graphical Abstracts</A> on our information site.Authors can make use of Elsevier's <A href=""http://webshop.elsevier.com/illustration-services/"">Illustration Services</A> to ensure the best presentation of their images and in accordance with all technical requirements.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Highlights</EM></STRONG>Highlights are mandatory for this journal. They consist of a short collection of bullet points that convey the core findings of the article and should be submitted in a separate editable file in the online submission system. Please use 'Highlights' in the file name and include 3 to 5 bullet points (maximum 85 characters, including spaces, per bullet point). You can view <A href=""https://www.elsevier.com/highlights"">example Highlights</A> on our information site.</P><P><STRONG>Keywords</STRONG>Immediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 6 keywords, using American spelling and avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts (avoid, for example, 'and', 'of').

The show, Netflix’s adaptation of Justin Simien’s 2014 critically acclaimed film of the same name, is in some ways both a continuation of the source material and a radical departure. The original film’s satirical portrayal of race relations and black identity at the fictional Ivy League school Winchester University followed a group of black students, led by Samantha White (Tessa Thompson), and a budding campaign against the predominantly white humor magazine <EM>Pastiche</EM> that culminates in a blackface party and small-time race riot.</P><P>The 2017 incarnation of <EM>Dear White People</EM> picks up where the original left off. With some holdovers from the original cast, the first four episodes of the show reconstruct the party and backlash that ended the film, and begin a story on a campus—and within a racial <mark>climate</mark>—that’s much different than the one viewers last saw at Winchester. But does the show, also written and co-directed by Simien, exceed the expectations set by the original? <EM>The Atlantic</EM>’s Vann Newkirk, Adrienne Green, Gillian White, and Ta-Nehisi Coates discuss the whole first season, so spoilers abound.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-2""><P><STRONG>Vann Newkirk: </STRONG>I enjoyed the show, and that’s an accomplishment because I didn’t like the film at all. I think this incarnation did a lot to flesh out characters in ways I found satisfying, and its use of multiple angles on the same basic events worked pretty well. But one of the things that sat in the back of my mind for all 10 episodes was that I have no idea whether <EM>Dear White People </EM>is primarily a commentary on race or a college sitcom. The use of different directors for different episodes makes it hard to tell, sometimes, and it’s unclear whether the moralizing elements are sincere or played for laughs (see: the show’s incessant use of the word “woke”).</P><P><STRONG>Adrienne Green:</STRONG> I would argue that <EM>Dear White People</EM> juggles aspirations to be both a scripted commentary on race and a sitcom about college students, and fails mildly in both regards. It’s a better show for assigning full episodes to the perspectives of each of the five black leads—Sam, Lionel, Troy, Coco, and Reggie—an obvious attempt to remedy critiques of the film’s lack of character development. Where this method falls short is the show’s use of the love triangle between Sam, the biracial activist leader of Winchester’s Black Student Union, Gabe, the white graduate student she’s dating, and Reggie, another member of the Black Student Union who has pined for her since freshman year, as the throughline for the season. At times of heightened tension, it felt like Gabe’s feelings, perspectives, and anxieties were centered in a narrative that could have spent a lot more time unpacking the trauma experienced by the other main characters.  </P><ASIDE class=""callout"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r' ',d,r'related',#data-omni-index,@data-article-id""><H4>

Even when employing obvious satire, especially when dealing with subdivisions in the black community, the jokes are<A href=""https://theringer.com/dear-white-people-netflix-tv-show-2017-473a56842803"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'526920'""> outdated</A> (<EM>so</EM> many uses of the word “hashtag”). Many of the supporting characters seem more like hollow stand-ins for ideologies than they are members of a cohesive cast: There’s a token African student, another student whose only references are to religion, and an Asian student whom viewers are forced to assume is “down.” Joelle, another black female student who’s best friends with the insufferable Sam, received glaringly little development despite having, I’d argue, the potential to be the most well-rounded character on the show. All in all, I think the series, while a detailed improvement on the film, struggles with its intersecting identities as much as its main characters did. I did laugh a little at the <EM>Scandal</EM> parody, though.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-3""><P><STRONG>Gillian White</STRONG>: I think the archetypes of black students at prestigious, white institutions were limited and somewhat flawed, even in their obvious hyperbole. The bifurcation of the black campus population between the “woke” students—their dress, their speech, their plans of action—and the preppy, weave-wearing, non-agitators they deemed to be decidedly less worthy of that title, was clearly an intentional exaggeration of what kinds of black people exist on the campuses of Ivy League schools.</P><P>But that bifurcation still leaves out some important players in the black student space on such campuses: Caribbean and African students (they only get a small nod via one character as you mentioned, Adrienne), who often make up a large portion of the black student population on such campuses. Because many are from overseas or have families that immigrated in recent decades, their experiences are often very different than black American students, which brings with it its own set of differing viewpoints on what progress should look and feel like. Though the show has Troy and Coco, who don’t agree with agitation but still show up for conversations about race, it leaves out the black kids on campus who choose to not participate in such conversations or engage socially with other black students at all. And those stories, too, are an important part of the experience and dynamic on campuses like Winchester’s.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-4""><P><STRONG>Ta-Nehisi Coates</STRONG>: I should say, I didn’t see the movie, and I didn’t see it almost entirely because of the title, <EM>Dear White People</EM>. There’s a long tradition of black folks pleading with white people. It’s a tradition that emerges from political necessity, so I get it; I’m just not very interested in it. Maybe the movie isn’t part of that tradition. Maybe it was everything I would have loved. But my prejudices kept me away. Make of that what you will.</P><P>There is some of that in the show, as it’s concerned primarily with racism, and only secondarily with black people. What I mean is that blackness in Netflix’s <EM>Dear White People </EM>is largely a mode of protest. Nearly everything revolves around racism and the pariah-like feelings it inspires. The show is much less concerned with the interior lives of black people. Is there a single scene of a black party in the series? There is a black sorority, but is there a single step show? Even the communal amusement—like the parody of <EM>Scandal</EM>—revolves around the relationship with white power.</P><P>If this sounds like criticism, it isn’t. I think <EM>Dear White People</EM>, the show, is a tremendous artistic achievement. It’s always hinting that there is something beyond the pleading and wokeness, something that the show’s more militant characters can’t see. Sometimes it comes in humor—Joelle’s interrupting Sam’s broadcast to figure out how to get “waist-thin and ass-thick.” Other times it comes in moments of deep pain—Coco’s confrontation with Sam over colorism after being autotuned. I couldn’t really handle a <EM>Dear White People</EM> that was literally “DEAR WHITE PEOPLE!” But this show feels like it’s more about what happens when your sense of being is married to people who don’t much like you.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-5""><P><STRONG>Newkirk: </STRONG>Having attended a Historically Black College (Morehouse), I agree with Ta-Nehisi’s not-criticism that racism was the star of the show, and not the black characters. My own college experience wasn’t defined by how it clashed with whiteness, and I know that even on real-life campuses like Winchester’s, it’s a lot more than dealing with racism. There’s so much drama within black college communities that needs unearthing, too. Hopefully in Season 2 we’ll get more frat calls and step shows and fried chicken Wednesdays. Hopefully.</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote instapaper_ignore"">“I think the black students who wind up going to PWIs are incredibly varied, just like the black students who go to HBCUs.”</ASIDE><P>To Gillian’s point, I can say the show’s depictions of its characters is kind of how black students at elite, predominantly white institutions (PWI) are viewed by many people who don’t attend such schools. All the characters on <EM>Dear White People </EM>are different shades of—can we say bougie here? Yeah, bougie. And it’s sometimes funny watching the students of Winchester struggle over their own particular slice of bougieness, although the heavy moments still feel heavy. I’ve always approached the dialogues about race and flare-ups on Ivy League campuses with a sort of detachment, because in my mind there’s still some of that stereotype of bougieness left. (Also, the <EM>Scandal </EM>parody was golden, as was the Iyanla Vanzant knock-off. I died.)</P><P><STRONG>Green:</STRONG> While I wouldn’t necessarily say I connected to any of the characters in the show, I did attend a PWI (Ohio University) at a time when issues of race and brutality against black people were at the forefront of discussion after the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, and Mike Brown. Factions of students dealt with those tensions in different ways, and I think the rift between Sam, an agitator, and Troy, the obedient son of the dean, was somewhat a true reflection of how multiple approaches to talking about race and flare-ups on campuses play out in real life.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-6""><P><STRONG>White: </STRONG>As someone who also went to a PWI (Columbia), I get that the perception of the black student body at PWIs might align closely with what’s presented in <EM>Dear White People</EM>. In reality I think the black students who wind up going to PWIs are incredibly varied, just like the black students who go to HBCUs. That’s true not just in background, but also in views on racial issues that arise, be they external (like those Adrienne mentioned) or internal campus relations (the main kind the show deals with).</P><P>The presumption of bougieness is actually why I found the Coco-Sam dynamic to be so interesting. Of course there are black kids who grew up in nice neighborhoods with lots of privilege. But there are many black kids at these very affluent institutions who are certainly not from affluent backgrounds, who are there in hopes that their four years will give them access to a better life. I also think that black kids who go to PWIs have the additional task of trying to navigate the differences within the black community, while coping with the realities of being black in America, while also trying to find a place at elite, white institutions that have histories of being inaccessible, hostile, and discriminatory. I think that can be a complex space to navigate, especially for young adults who are still trying to figure out where they stand absent parental influence.</P><P><STRONG>Newkirk</STRONG>: I thought the show’s attention to detail helped illustrate the students’ efforts at navigating those complex spaces, but it takes an eye and familiarity to make sense of those details. The little things like Troy and Coco’s conservative-leaning Congress of Racial Equality are hilarious if you know the history behind the real-life CORE, and its transformation from a mainstream civil-rights organization to a radical black-power organization in the ’60s, then to<A href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2005/05/put-tiger-your-think-tank"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'526920'""> a right-wing, <mark>climate</mark>-denying</A> think tank after Nixon. The style cues also fit in here, and watching the characters’ transformations from freshman year to their adult identities (especially Sam’s adoption of an impressive accessories collection) are fun if you’ve followed black popular culture and aesthetics over the past few years.</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote instapaper_ignore"">“This season was the most useful addition to the campus free-speech debate in years.”</ASIDE><P><STRONG>Coates</STRONG>: Yeah. I’m intentionally avoiding learning too much about who wrote what in the show, but Vann, you are dead-on in terms of the show’s deep knowledge of tradition. I feel like that’s all through the show, too. And maybe that is what lends itself to the kinds of generalizations you guys didn’t like. The whole thing felt like satire to me, though. In a good way. None of these black people really resembled any I knew—with two exceptions, Joelle and Coco. The latter gets more screen-time, and I think there is a <EM>strong</EM> argument that Coco is the grounding of the show. (Maybe an argument for Lionel, too.) But I thought Antoinette Robertson’s performance as Coco was so spot-on, and the character so sculpted, that I found myself rooting for her even as she sold out. It felt like she’d earned a break.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-7""><P><STRONG>White: </STRONG>I totally agree with that sentiment. I thought “Chapter 4,” where we learn more about Coco’s backstory and her relationship with Sam, was one of the most compelling episodes of the series. The splintering of their friendship and views about how to carve out a space for themselves on a campus where neither feels immediately accepted set up perhaps some of the show’s most interesting and illuminating relationship dynamics. The revelation that Coco is, in fact, keenly aware of her blackness and that her lack of acceptance of her skin, hair, and upbringing comes not only from white people, but also from other black people, was critically important.</P><P>Similarly, her assertion that Sam’s experience of searching for acceptance is drastically different, since her upbringing, light skin, and hair give her the ability to move more fluidly between crowds, brought some necessary history and context to a plot that could sometimes feel a bit narrow. (The plot felt especially limited for how it centered on the response to the blackface party while so many other issues swirled around the main characters.) I think the backstories explored in that particular episode really helped inform viewers about the choices that characters made when responding to racial tensions and discrimination at an institution apparently eager to turn a blind eye.</P><P><STRONG>Newkirk:</STRONG> I will advance that this season was the most useful addition to the campus free-speech debate in years<STRONG>.  </STRONG>So much of the media freakout over “safe spaces” and “political correctness” comes from 50-year-old columnists and seems strangely disconnected from actual campus life today. <EM>Dear White People</EM> attempts to complicate that by illustrating both the destructive ends of bigoted speech and the usefulness of speech in advancing marginalized causes. And it shows the debates over free speech in the midst of students actually navigating the marketplace of ideas and coming up against the differences between the ideal and real life. I thought the fact that Lionel’s reporting at the fictional <EM>Independent </EM>newspaper was stonewalled by moneyed, racist interests helps put the debate back into focus, too. The real power to dictate speech and ideas still comes from circles well beyond those of liberal students.</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote instapaper_ignore"">“If I hear the word ‘woke’ again, I’m gonna vomit.”</ASIDE><P><STRONG>Green:</STRONG> For sure. It felt like the broadest goal of the show was to emphasize how the grievances of black students on majority-white elite campuses are often discounted, manipulated, or ignored by the administration (and in the case of Lionel and <EM>Independent</EM>, the donor interests associated with them). The series succeeded in highlighting the imperfections in the strategies students use to cope with identity politics, and the challenges that will likely stay with them once they leave the campus.</P><P>For example, Sam and Reggie relied on a much more militant approach than Troy and Coco, who advocated for engaging with the university administration, and Lionel, who chose to process his experiences as a black Winchester student via his reporting. These differences were most apparent in their responses to <EM>Pastiche</EM>’s blackface party and Reggie’s encounter with police in episode five. However, I was disappointed by the times the show meditated more on the strained relationships that resulted from the Reggie party scene (Sam/Gabe, Troy/his father) than on how Reggie dealt with his own trauma on a personal level.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-8""><P><STRONG>Newkirk:</STRONG> That’s pretty spot-on. While I personally appreciated the focus on those strained relationships, I think <EM>Dear White People</EM> missed a golden opportunity to dig deep into Reggie’s psyche and make a commentary about the psychological effects of activism and involvement in policy brutality, as well as the line between activism and experience.</P><P><STRONG>White</STRONG>: I found the episode that starts with Reggie agreeing to try to break out of his shell and have a fun time hanging out with both his white and black peers—only to end in a racial brawl and a cop pulling a gun on him—to be the most heartbreaking of the series. I loved that the episode ended with Reggie, who has been shown to have no problem sticking up for himself, and even goading others into tense encounters, crying on the floor of his dorm room as he tries to process what just happened and the powerlessness that he feels. For a show that’s ostensibly trying to grapple with these very complexities, <EM>Dear White People </EM>wasted its chance to delve into a devastating moment that so many black Americans, and black students, could surely relate to by not building on that raw emotion in the next episode.</P><P><STRONG>Green:</STRONG> Agreed, Gillian. The fallout from Reggie’s encounter with the police felt more like a buildup of passion between Sam and Reggie, and minimized what, as Vann said, was a golden opportunity. The poem that Reggie performed at the open-mic could have been the sole outlet for him to vocalize his pain, thus offering him and viewers some catharsis after a very emotional fifth episode. Instead, it was treated as an effort to spark intimacy with Sam. The deflated re-read of the same poem on her radio show, that he performed halfheartedly while watching Sam plead with Gabe to take her back, only underscored how mismatched this thread was for the gravity of the situation. Oddly, Coco delivered the most direct line of the season about race at Winchester: “As soon as you double down on your blackness, they will double down on their bullshit ... Who cares if you’re ‘woke’ or not if you’re dead?”</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-9""><P><STRONG>Newkirk: </STRONG>If I hear the word “woke” again, I’m gonna vomit. I’m a fan of the comedy in the show iteration of <EM>Dear White People,</EM> but the dialogue at times felt it was written by a parody statement T-shirt generator. The “woke or not” app made me want to fight people. I get that it seems exactly like something college kids actually do and look back on as adults and groan about, but I really can’t tell if the show is serious about it or not. I can’t tell if a lot of the things that I laughed about with <EM>Dear White People</EM> were intended as knowing jokes or were actually just written on a slam blog from 2014, but the “woke” stuff was just especially bad.</P><P><STRONG>Coates: </STRONG><EM>I liked “WOKE OR NOT”!</EM> Come on! It was satire. All kidding aside, I take your point, but I thought the writers were very self-aware. Wasn’t the whole idea of that app to pan the self-righteousness of its creators?</P><P>One thing that is perhaps shading my view, for the better, of the show is I don’t watch that much TV. I’ve seen, and liked, <EM>Insecure</EM> and <EM>Atlanta</EM>. But I have a hard time situating <EM>Dear White People</EM> in the larger universe of black television. Also. It is incredible that one can now say “larger universe of black television” earnestly. I remember when no one in my city had cable. And it was, like, three channels. Damn, I’m old ...</P><P><STRONG>Green: </STRONG>Having seen and enjoyed new shows like<EM> Insecure</EM> and <EM>Atlanta</EM>—shows that came out in 2016, widely regarded as a “banner year” for black television—what stood out to me was how many of them not only advanced the conversation about the potential for diversity in television, but also supplied nuance to stories that represented specific iterations of the black experience<STRONG>.</STRONG></P><P>While I found <EM>Dear White People</EM> to be somewhat relatable and filled with<A href=""https://www.buzzfeed.com/sylviaobell/dear-black-people?utm_term=.nsYkdOrJk#.xcPmrADPm"" data-omni-click=""r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'526920'""> many cultural references</A> that could resonate with its black viewers—my favorite being the quip about why nothing Stacey Dash did after <EM>Clueless</EM> matters—it might lack the intentionality around making characters both flawed but well-rounded that made these other shows so appealing. This first season ends with the apparent dissolution of the love triangle and a final gut punch, with Sam unable to answer the question of whether protesting accomplishes anything at all. The season has come full circle in a way that I think gives the second season a lot of room to work on its missteps.</P></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The average home actually contributes more to global warming than the average car. This is because much of the energy we use in our homes comes from power plants which burn fossil fuel to power our electric products.</P><P>To reduce the amount of electricity used in our homes:</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Switch to energy-efficient lighting</STRONG>
Replace the familiar incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs. For each CFL bulb replacement, you’ll lower your energy bill and keep nearly 700 pounds of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide out of the air over the bulb’s lifetime. CFL bulbs last much longer and use only a quarter of the energy consumed by conventional bulbs. LED bulbs are also energy-saving, but have a narrower range of application. Advances in LED bulb technology, however, are leading to more applications for these bulbs in the home. LEDs are more efficient than CFLs and do not have issues surrounding disposal, as do the CFLs. <A href=""https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides/energy-efficient-lighting/"">More info</A>.</LI><LI><STRONG>Improve the efficiency of home appliances</STRONG>
Home appliances vary greatly in terms of energy-efficiency and operating costs. The more energy-efficient an appliance is, the less it costs to run. You can lower your utility bill and help protect the environment. <A href=""https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides/energy-efficient-appliances/"">Here’s how.</A></LI><LI><STRONG>Buy energy-efficient appliances when shopping for a new appliance</STRONG>
Do this especially when shopping for a major appliance such as a refrigerator, dishwasher, or air-conditioner – select the one with the highest energy efficiency rating. By opting for a refrigerator with the Energy Star label — indicating it uses at least 15 percent less energy than the federal requirement — you can reduce <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide <mark>pollution</mark> by nearly a ton in total. <A href=""https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides/energy-efficient-appliances/"">More info</A>.</LI><LI><STRONG>Reduce energy needed for heating</STRONG>
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, heating and cooling systems in the U.S. emit over a half billion tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into the atmosphere each year. Much of the energy used for heating our homes is wasted, and yet the prevention is, in many cases, simple and inexpensive. <A href=""https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides/energy-efficient-heating/"">Here’s how</A>.</LI><LI><STRONG>Reduce energy needed for cooling</STRONG>
Air conditioners alone use up to 1/6th of the electricity in the U.S. and, on hot summer days, consume 43% of the U.S. peak power load. You can reduce much of the need for air conditioning, and enjoy a cost savings benefit, by using ‘passive’ techniques to help cool your home. <A href=""https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides/natural-home-cooling/"">Here’s how</A>.</LI></UL></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class=""post-section""><DIV class=""container container--sm""><H2>Improve vehicle fuel-efficiency</H2><P>The second largest source of greenhouse gases is transportation. Motor vehicles are responsible for about a third of all <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions in the U.S. and Canada.</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Practice fuel-efficient driving</STRONG>
Every gallon of gasoline burned puts 26 pounds of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into the atmosphere. You can boost the overall fuel-efficiency of your car as much as 30% by simple vehicle maintenance and attention to your style of driving. <A href=""https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides/fuel-efficient-driving/"">Read these tips for fuel-efficient driving.</A></LI><LI><STRONG>Buy a fuel-efficient car</STRONG>
Even more important is the choice of car or truck you buy. If you buy a new car that gets 10 more miles per gallon than your old car, the amount of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide reduction realized in one year will be about 2,500 pounds. The new hybrid cars, using efficient gas-electric engines, can cut global warming <mark>pollution</mark> by 30% or more. <A href=""https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides/hybrid-cars/"">Learn more about hybrid cars</A>.</LI><LI><STRONG>Recycle air conditioner coolant</STRONG>
If your car has an air conditioner, make sure you recycle its coolant whenever you have it serviced. You can save thousands of pounds of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide each year by doing this.</LI><LI><STRONG>Drive less</STRONG>
You’ll save energy by taking the bus, riding a bike, or walking. Try consolidating trips to the mall or longer routine drives. Encourage car-pooling.</LI></UL></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class=""post-section""><DIV class=""container container--sm""><H2>Conserve energy in the home and yard</H2><P>Yard maintenance contributes significantly to greenhouse emissions. Per hour of operation, a power lawn mower emits 10-12 times as much hydro<mark>carbon</mark> as a typical auto. A weedeater emits 21 times more and a leaf blower 34 times more.</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Reduce lawn size</STRONG>
Lawn size can be reduced by adding shrubs, beds, ground covers and mulched areas. Try creating a lawn area small enough to be mowed using an efficient reel (push) mower. Lawn edging can be set low enough to mow over, reducing or eliminating the need for a weed-eater. <A href=""https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides/lawn-alternatives/"">More info.</A></LI><LI><STRONG>Recycle whenever possible</STRONG>
Aluminum cans, newspapers, magazines, cardboard, glass – anything recycled reduces the energy needed to create new products. To find the recycling center nearest you, call: 1 800-CLEANUP.

Today, the food choices available in supermarkets come from all over the world. All of this ‘traffic’ in food requires staggering amounts of fuel – generally by refrigerated airplanes or transport trucks. Food transportation is one of the fastest growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions. <A href=""https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides-categories/eat/"">More info</A>.</LI><LI><STRONG>Eat vegetarian meals</STRONG>
Vegetarian food requires much less energy to produce.

This can contribute saving up to 5000 pounds of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide per year.</LI><LI><STRONG>Choose clean energy options</STRONG>
If you can choose your electricity supplier, pick a company that generates at least half its power from wind, solar energy and other renewable sources.</LI><LI><STRONG>Buy clean energy certificates and <mark>carbon</mark> offsets</STRONG>
Help spur the renewable energy market and cut global warming <mark>pollution</mark> with “wind certificates” or “green tags,” which represent clean power you can add to the nation’s energy grid in place of electricity from fossil fuels. <A href=""http://www.green-e.org/gogreene.shtml"">More info</A>. A “<mark>carbon</mark> offset” is an emission reduction credit which can be purchased by individuals, businesses and governments to reduce their net greenhouse gas emissions. <A href=""https://learn.eartheasy.com/articles/<mark>carbon</mark>-offsets/"">More info.</A></LI></UL><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Making energy conservation a part of our daily awareness is essential to the goal of reducing global warming.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>While it may be difficult to adopt some of these suggestions, any amount of energy saved is significant.

After a few snaps into the silence, he finally spoke: <EM>« Every time I snap my fingers, an African child dies »</EM>.

          </A></P><P>Don’t get me wrong, I respect Bono. The work that he and other celebrities like him have done to bring attention to causes like debt relief and HIV/AIDS treatment has saved real lives. But I recount this joke because I think it illustrates so succinctly one of the most interesting – and problematic – things about modern philanthropy: As currently practiced, philanthropy preserves existing power structures and dynamics that have caused much of the suffering it seeks to alleviate and, in so doing, operates at cross purposes to its original intention. This is especially true of Western philanthropy in Africa.</P><H2 class=""intertitre"">Absolute power over black lives</H2><P>Breaking the joke down as it relates to structures and dynamics reveals this: A white man speaking from his god-like perch to a primarily white audience about Africans so wretched that this audience conflates good intentions and absolute power over black lives. If that sounds like colonialism, it’s not by chance. Indeed, it is impossible to talk about philanthropy in Africa without discussing colonialism.</P><P>But, first, what exactly is philanthropy? Philanthropy has been defined as the love of humanity, in the sense of caring and nourishing. Samuel Johnson called it love of mankind and good nature. In its purest form, it is a truly revolutionary act. To practice philanthropy is to recognize, fully and intimately, the inherent humanity of each and every person, especially by striving to modify the conditions that prevent people from fully realizing their true humanity. This can mean alleviating debasing poverty or fighting oppressive political structures – there are many ways to practice love of humanity, in the sense of caring and nourishing. However, the legacy of colonialism and the current mess of modern-day philanthropy in Africa complicate the matter.</P><P>It is important to begin by acknowledging how difficult it is for humans – with all our different ethnicities, nationalities and races (however essentializing these terms may be) – to come up with a truly comprehensive and inclusive idea of who is and isn’t human. This failure leads to schizophrenic definitions of humanness – with far-reaching consequences for the practice of philanthropy in Africa, resulting from Africa’s encounter with Europe and European ideas of what it means to be truly human.</P><P class=""lire js_marqueur_restreint_atome marqueur_restreint"">

As the <A target=""_blank"" onclick=""return false;"" class=""lien_interne conjug"" href=""https://conjugaison.lemonde.fr/conjugaison/premier-groupe/philosopher/"" title=""Conjugaison du verbe philosopher"">philosopher</A> Immanuel Kant wrote in his 1763 Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and the Sublime: <EM>« The Negroes of Africa have by nature no feeling that rises above the trifling… So fundamental is the difference between these two races of man, and it appears to be as great in regard to mental capacities as in color. »</EM></P><P>This position was shared by many of Kant’s contemporary Enlightenment philosophers and architects of the liberal order from which the practice of modern philanthropy grew. It is all the more disturbing considering that Kant’s construct of cosmopolitanism is crucial to present-day practices of global philanthropy. Some might argue that the moral philosopher need not be perfect for his philosophy to have merit. However, the damage infectious racism has inflicted on the concept of philanthropy is so insidious and acute that it renders the concept virtually unsalvageable. For Kant’s original sin in conceptualizing who counts as human within the cosmopolitan ideal raises the following vital question: If the liberal order does not consider Africans fully human, can philanthropy as a practice and a concept apply to Africans? If not, we cannot call that exchange philanthropy; we must call it something else.</P><H2 class=""intertitre"">Dehumanization in the service of extraction</H2><P>This is where we the robust confusion of the colonial enterprise comes into play. This enterprise can be summed up as follows: The simple economics of Europe’s industrialization demanded extraction of African resources (including humans), and justifying that extraction required codifying ever more extreme versions of Kant’s racism, resulting in the familiar vicious cycle: Dehumanization in the service of extraction made Europeans wealthier while making Africans poorer and therefore less human-seeming, justifying further extraction. And so, through the ages, Africans became increasingly poor and seemingly less human, thus precipitating further extraction.</P><P>Yet, paired with capitalism, liberalism can often be an extremely inconvenient set of philosophies. While Europeans may not have wanted to believe that Africans were humans, fundamentally of course they knew that they were. And so, in order to absolve themselves – and to justify the extraction – they came up with the idea of colonialism as a so-called “civilizing mission.” Europeans would be the custodians of Africa’s vast resources until Africans grew into the ability to manage them themselves. This is the root of modern-day philanthropy in Africa. In the words of Rudyard Kipling:</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""citation"">« Take up the White Man’s burden— The savage wars of peace— Fill full the mouth of Famine— And bid the sickness cease. »</BLOCKQUOTE><P>What marvelous conjecture! It is as though I were to come to your house, steal your things, kick you onto the street and then proclaim to the world that I will grudgingly take up the burden of caring for your lazy, unwashed self.</P><H2 class=""intertitre"">« A land of opportunity »</H2><P>But that is all in the past, people say. What use is there in rehashing what happened decades, even centuries, ago? We are beyond that kind of thinking. If only. In fact, it is irrefutable that a colonial mindset still shapes modern ideas about European philanthropic engagement in Africa. Indeed, it is so ingrained that many of us fail to realize when we make reference to what can only be referred to as basic foolishness. To quote the ever-progressive [French President] Macron at the most recent G20 summit, for example: <EM>« The challenge of Africa, it is totally different, it is much deeper, it is civilizational, today... At the same time, we have countries that are tremendously successful, with an extraordinary growth rate that makes people say that Africa is a land of opportunity »</EM>. A land of opportunity for whom? Suffice it to say that when a European “discovers” a land of opportunity, it rarely works out very well for the natives.</P><P>The upstanding King Leopold the Second of Belgium says it better than I would ever want to and perhaps more directly than Macron and other world leaders are willing to. (Warning: this is difficult to read:)</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""citation"">« Evangelize the niggers so that they stay forever in submission to the white colonialists, so they never revolt against the restraints they are undergoing… Convert always the blacks by using the whip. Keep their women in nine months of submission to work freely for us. Force them to pay you in sign of recognition – goats, chickens or eggs – every time you visit their villages. And make sure that niggers never become rich. Sing every day that it’s impossible for the rich to <A target=""_blank"" onclick=""return false;"" class=""lien_interne conjug"" href=""https://conjugaison.lemonde.fr/conjugaison/premier-groupe/enter/"" title=""Conjugaison du verbe enter"">enter</A> heaven. Make them pay tax each week at Sunday mass. Use the money supposed for the poor, to build flourishing business centers. Institute a confessional system, which allows you to be good detectives denouncing any black that has a different consciousness contrary to that of the decision-maker. Teach the niggers to forget their heroes and to adore only ours. Never present a chair to a black that comes to visit you. Don’t give him more than one cigarette. Never invite him for dinner even if he gives you a chicken every time you arrive at his house. »</BLOCKQUOTE><P>My point in quoting this (<A href=""http://www.fafich.ufmg.br/luarnaut/Letter%20Leopold%20II%20to%20Colonial%20Missionaries.pdf"">whole letter here</A>) is threefold: First, King Leopold was not exactly a nice man. Second, he was perhaps a little too direct about his intentions – though he was no more invested in perpetuating the racialized system of inequality that fueled the extractive colonial dream than, say, the British, French, Portuguese, Dutch or Germans. Third, extraction and the idea that the civilizing process of extraction ultimately did Africans some good have always been intimately connected. In other words, stealing from us was in fact giving to us, a kindness for which we should, to this day, be grateful (1).</P><H2 class=""intertitre"">« We paid for all of this »</H2><P>This dynamic is so ingrained in our interactions that it results in absurd situations. I remember years ago, when I happened to be in London at the same time as my mother during her first tenure as Nigeria’s Minister of Finance. She was there to make the case for debt relief and the only way I could squeeze into her busy schedule was by catching a ride with her between her meetings. As we sped down Whitehall, I looked out at the majestic buildings and said to her, <EM>« This is what we need in Nigeria to turn things around, some monumental architecture »</EM>. Without looking up from her papers, she said, <EM>« But we paid for all of this. »</EM></P><P>We did. And, in many ways, we are still paying for it. That is why Western philanthropy in present-day Africa is so perverse. In the words of the Kenyan novelist Ngugi wa Thiongo:</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""citation"">« Why did Africa let Europe cart away millions of Africa’s souls from the continent to the four corners of the wind? How could Europe lord it over a continent ten times its size? Why does needy Africa continue to let its wealth meet the needs of those outside its borders and then follow behind with hands outstretched for a loan of the very wealth it let go? »</BLOCKQUOTE><P>Stealing a thousand dollars from me and then giving me a dollar as you pass by on the street cannot be called philanthropy. There is no love of humankind in that action. There is no good nature. In that action, there is no push towards changing structures that dehumanize.</P><P>Yet my intention in outlining this absurd arrangement at length is not to overplay the atrocities and indignities perpetrated through colonialism. Rather, I want to lay out the situation clearly to allow modern-day philanthropists to see exactly where they can make the most impact. For me, this means moving the discussion about philanthropy in Africa towards the idea of justice. More specifically, when I refer to philanthropy reframed as justice, what I mean very concretely is the dreaded « R » word: reparations.</P><H2 class=""intertitre"">Unpaid labor extracted from Africans</H2><P>Consider this number: 97 trillion dollars. According to <EM>The Guardian</EM>, that is an extremely conservative estimate of all the unpaid labor extracted from Africans in North American colonies between 1619 and 1865. It does not include extraction from African countries after 1865. Nor does it include the value of non-human resources. It refers exclusively to African labor over a roughly 240-year period – labor that was absolutely fundamental in building up the very wealth in Europe and America that now makes private philanthropy possible. In contrast, philanthropic flows and official development assistance from the global North to the global South are, respectively, around 60 billion dollars a year and 150 billion dollars a year. To reach 97 trillion dollars, it would take over 1,500 years of « philanthropic » giving and 485 years of official development assistance.</P><P class=""lire js_marqueur_restreint_atome marqueur_restreint"">

                Agent philanthropique, un métier d’avenir
    </A></P><P>In other words, the level of wealth transfer – in this case a euphemism for robbery – that occurred created a gap so insurmountable that it is routinely ignored. At best, it invites arguments about the impossibility of paying back 97 trillion dollars. Yet there is a precedent for reparations for colonialism in Africa. In 2012, the British offered a formal apology and agreed to pay 20 million pounds to Kenyan Kikuyus unfortunate enough to have encountered the British civilizing mission of the 1950s. Obviously, the sum returned pales in comparison to the cost of dehumanization and the value of the land taken. But what matters most to people is acknowledging that wrong was done. Apology is a crucial first step towards affirming a person’s humanity.</P><P>Now, if philanthropy is really about love of humanity and changing structural dynamics that prevent the full expression of that love, we cannot hope to change the structural dynamics between Africa and Europe without acknowledging and righting the wrongs of the past. To lead the way in creating a new relationship, philanthropic institutions must move away from the message <EM>« This is our money, which we are altruistically giving you »</EM>, and towards the message <EM>« This is your money, made from resources we wrongfully appropriated and which we are privileged to give back. »</EM></P><P>If philanthropic relations today are rooted in the idea of African inhumanity conveyed alongside the « philanthro-colonial » project, then there is no reason why those relations cannot also convey the argument <EM>« Yes, you’re human, I’m so sorry we took your lives, land and money »</EM> and be used as a foundation for change. Such a change in messaging would be a win-win situation. It would allow the West to move towards fully acknowledging its own humanity by asking for forgiveness and stepping into a space beyond absolute capitalism, which readily treats human life as a commodity. And it would allow Africans to proceed as full equals rather than second-tier characters on the world stage. And we would get some of our money back.</P><P class=""lire js_marqueur_restreint_atome marqueur_restreint"">

                La philanthropie, un must mondain qui pourrait sauver le monde
    </A></P><P>Yet messaging is just the first step. Step two is trickier because it involves actual money. How does one calculate and then return the astronomical sum of value extracted from Africa that has built the wealth of Western nations and allowed their people to be so « philanthropic »? How does one decide who pays? At the root of the aversion to reparations is the notion that <EM>« my ancestors weren’t colonialists or slavers »</EM>. For many people it feels like stealing: You are taking my hard-earned money or property and giving it to benefit someone who didn’t work for it. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?</P><P>In the modern era, we need to stop seeing reparations as a zero-sum transfer and instead imagine a mutually beneficial enterprise. As I have already argued, admitting to the wrongdoings perpetrated against Africans allows both sides to reclaim their humanity. But we must go a step further. The challenges the world faces, the challenges Africa faces, are not African challenges, specific or containable to that continent. They are human challenges. To give just one example, <mark>climate change</mark>, which will disproportionately impact the African continent, further exacerbating issues caused by colonial extraction, is a global issue. It is not Africans who are primarily responsible for <mark>climate change</mark>; the consequences, like <mark>climate</mark> refugees will continue to move in one direction only. And unless one is prepared to build a wall and kill everyone who tries to get over it (as one mediocre French novelist has suggested), we all need to prepare for a new way of life.</P><P>Imagine if we decided to use the opportunity of reparations as philanthropy to model new systems of living to prepare us for the life on earth to come. That would be philanthropy in its truest sense, transforming reparations from a third rail into an investment for all humankind.</P><H2 class=""intertitre"">Restitution for Africa’s suffering would benefit the world</H2><P>Let us return to the number 97 trillion to do a thought experiment. What if we set up a 97-trillion-dollar fund, based on the acknowledgement, <EM>« This is your wealth, which we have wrongfully appropriated and are privileged to give back »</EM>, using this fantastical-seeming but actually conservative estimate of forcefully appropriated labor as a starting point. What if we invested heavily in massive infrastructure development in Africa – power, roads, mass transit – but in a 21st-century way that treats environmental costs as real and recognizes human need as only one of a vast constellation of planetary needs? What if we used this money to re-imagine urbanization on the continent, with planners embracing the idea of increased population concentrations in cities and building unique and humanizing high-density living with vertical farms, waste-to-energy processes, nuclear power and more? What if we agreed to let entire sections of the continent that have suffered from exploitative extraction return to their natural states? What if we allowed depleted rainforests to grow back into massive <mark>carbon</mark> sinks while we hyper-looped between our reimagined urban centers? What if we created real opportunities for knowledge exchange, in which technical expertise made possible by years of wealth accumulation in Western countries was combined with the fresh vision of youthful African minds through future-forward educational models? This would literally be world changing.</P><P class=""lire js_marqueur_restreint_atome marqueur_restreint"">

                La philanthropie à l’épreuve du terrain
    </A></P><P>Restitution for Africa’s suffering would benefit the world. Africa has borne the painful costs of the world’s wealth-building for centuries and is poised to shoulder even greater costs as the <mark>climate</mark> warms and the resulting chaos envelops the planet, breaking down current systems of organization. I cannot speak for all Africans, but I for one would gladly have my continent and my people be at the forefront of saving and improving the world that we were unwillingly conscripted to build. I would gladly use our money to ensure that all humans benefit and persevere. This is true philanthropy.</P><P>If you think this is crazy, please take a moment to examine your resistance. Where does it come from? Are you sure it isn’t fear, racism perhaps? I challenge you to claim that what I am suggesting is worse than collectively stealing and/or benefitting from hundreds of trillions of dollars of labor and resources from Africa and then giving back a few billion through scattered pet projects that assuage consciences but do little to actually transform the conditions that create deprivation. Has the current model, where Bob makes a billion dollars for himself by causing 20 billion in damage and then gives back a hundred million, really changed anything? Solving some problems requires pooling resources and spending strategically. Think of reparations as providing the focus necessary to pool philanthropic assets and restore humanity to the endeavor. That requires bold thinking and action, individuals willing to invest in a new way of thinking about giving.</P><P class=""lire js_marqueur_restreint_atome marqueur_restreint"">

                Philanthropie : la dernière utopie
    </A></P><P>Now let me further complicate the scenario. The 97-trillion-dollar fund would need to be managed completely by Africans. Why? First, if it isn’t your money, you shouldn’t be the one deciding how it is spent. And yes, for those who must point it out, there is the issue of corruption across the continent, but the wrong of corruption can be tackled at the same time as the wrong of colonial extraction. If you disagree, then consider the following absurdity: Before the Swiss returned to Nigeria part of the money stashed in a Swiss bank account by one of Nigeria’s <A target=""_blank"" onclick=""return false;"" class=""lien_interne conjug"" href=""https://conjugaison.lemonde.fr/conjugaison/premier-groupe/former/"" title=""Conjugaison du verbe former"">former</A> military dictators, they asked the Nigerians to present a plan for how they would spend it. How patronizing! Imagine someone stealing your money (after all, someone who knowingly holds stolen money and makes money off the interest is also a thief) and, then, before giving it back, telling you they are concerned that you lack the good sense to spend that money properly. This breed of nonsense surpasses all nonsense.</P><H2 class=""intertitre"">« Don’t expect anything in return »</H2><P>On another level, allow me to drop a bit of wisdom from my grandfather. He told me that the African way of giving is to give completely: <EM>« Don’t ask what is done with the money and don’t expect anything, not even an ounce of gratitude, in return. »</EM> This is something that philanthropies – especially those operating in Africa – have forgotten. They are so blinded by stereotypes of shifty Africans misusing funds that they either refuse to give directly or only give to white people working in Africa. I have seen philanthropies give young white people with zero experience and no clue money to save Africans from themselves while pointedly refusing to give money to experienced Africans because of « concerns » about governance. A word of advice: Stop it. Assuming you believe that it’s your money to give, then giving with conditions is hardly philanthropy. But, since we’ve determined that it isn’t your money to give, I stand by my first point: You don’t get to decide. And, finally, relinquishing control to another human being – the ultimate expression of trust – is actually the most important way of affirming another person’s humanity. Again: true philanthropy.</P><P class=""lire"">

    </A></P><P>But this is just a thought experiment. The billions of dollars in bank accounts and charitable trusts are still exactly where they were 20 minutes ago. That might make you feel secure, for now. But we all know the world is changing too rapidly for security to last. Despite what closed-border proponents say, no amount of firepower can stop the unwashed hordes from crashing your party. To the do-gooders, there are no existing philanthropic bandages to close the massive wounds opened by rapacious acquisition of wealth at Africans’ expense. If we truly want a different world, we need a different way of thinking. We need to truly honor our commitment to the philanthropic essence. Humans for humans. Re-imagining philanthropy as reparations is one path towards a new way of thinking. There are certainly others. But, either way, if we want different or better results from philanthropy, we need to think and act differently. Otherwise, we need to admit to ourselves that we are not really all that interested in change and prepare for the winter (or perpetual summer) that will surely come.</P><P>I think I’ve made it quite clear where I stand.

She sips a caffe late eventhough it is already past 8 pm. It has been a cold December day with masses of snow falling unmercifully and turning the Polish capital’s usual greyness into pure white. “<EM>Warsaw actually looks nice these days</EM>” Barbara Nowacka says and smiles. It will be one of only a few smiles this evening. Barbara came to talk about her mother.</P><P>This month, in April 2011, will mark the first anniversary of her mother’s death. It will also be the anniversary of a national tragedy. On April, Poland suffered one of its worst political disasters after President Lech Kaczyński and an exclusive government delegation were killed in a plane crash over the Russian city of Smolensk. Izabela Jaruga-Nowacka was one of only a couple of accompanions to the presidents’s delegation, hand-selected by Lech Kaczyński and his staff. One of the most important and out-spoken politician of the opposition, she had gained the respect of politicians of all colours for her sharp ability to transform her views and beliefs into political actions. At the time of the accident, daughter Barbara was heavily pregnant, due any minute. “<EM>She wanted to spend the weekend after the trip with us. She loved our son and he adored her. But she never returned home. It’s still impossible for him to understand.</EM>”</P><P>Izabela-Nowacka never ceased to fight, not for herself when she was suspended from university after she had refused to falter to the rule of the Communist regime, not for others when heavily armed police violently stormed a gay rights demonstration in the middle of the capital. The mayor back then who ordered the rough move of the police force on the protesters, was Kaczyński. Jaruga-Nowacka was a national parliamentarian and one of the organisers of the event. It’s remarkable for her whole career that she managed to get even her opponents to collaborate years later. “<EM>My mother never believed in revenge or the like. She tried to be constructive, in private as well as in public life.</EM>”, Barbara says. Her new-born daughter is fast asleep at home. Like a miracle, baby and mother remained unharmed from the shock and stress.</P><P>“<EM>Izabela Jaruga-Nowacka was one of the most impressive and outspoken feminist activists in Poland of last 20 years. She was the only one who successfully managed to work within women's movement and in politics.</EM>” Wanda Nowicka today is the Executive Director of the Polish Federation for Women and Family Planning, an organisation that Izabela-Jaruga had founded to advocate for reproductive rights and for legalising abortion in Poland. Nowicka and Jaruga-Nowacka have shared parts of the way, especially in overturning the country’s 1993 anti-abortion law.</P><P>Taking her issues to the streets of Warsaw was something Jaruga-Nowacka never shyed away from, not even when she served as Deputy Prime Minister in the national government. Under her term in office, many things changed for the better for women and minorities in Poland  “<EM>She always spoke on behalf of the most vulnerable and socially excluded. She was not only engaged in political struggles, she personally engaded in defence of discriminated individuals.</EM>”, Nowicka remembers.</P><P>Izabela Jaruga-Nowacka became an active politician only in 1991 when her country took its first steps as a democracy. During the communist rule Nowacka, a trained ethnologist spezialised in Mongolian had abstained from being politically active but never stopped debating the future of Poland and the possibilities for democratizing her homeland with friends and family. In 1992, she was one of the founding members of the Union of labour and 9 years later, she became the country’s first Government Plenipotentiary for Equal Status of Men and Women and another 3 years later, she was Deputy Prime Minister.</P><P>Her uncompromised fight for human rights, especially those of women and sexual minorities, made her a an icon also among civil society. As Wanda Nowicka puts it: “<EM>She will always remain with women's movement in Poland as one of our heroines. She was the one of those few who cannot be easily replaced.</EM>”</P><P>Written by:</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

To see how they are best deployed in each region of the world, use the menu at left.</H3><UL><LI><STRONG>Boosting energy efficiency</STRONG>: The energy used to power, heat, and cool our homes, businesses, and industries is the single largest contributor to global warming. Energy efficiency technologies allow us to use less energy to get the same—or higher—level of production, service, and comfort. This approach has vast potential to save both energy and money, and can be deployed quickly.</LI><LI><STRONG>Greening transportation</STRONG>: The transportation sector's emissions have increased at a faster rate than any other energy-using sector over the past decade. A variety of solutions are at hand, including improving efficiency (miles per gallon) in all modes of transport, switching to low-<mark>carbon</mark> fuels, and reducing vehicle miles traveled through smart growth and more efficient mass transportation systems.</LI><LI><STRONG>Revving up renewables</STRONG>: Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal and bioenergy are available around the world. Multiple studies have shown that renewable energy has the technical potential to meet the vast majority of our energy needs. Renewable technologies can be deployed quickly, are increasingly cost-effective, and create jobs while reducing <mark>pollution</mark>.</LI><LI><STRONG>Phasing out fossil fuel electricity</STRONG>: Dramatically reducing our use of fossil fuels—especially <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive coal—is essential to tackle <mark>climate change</mark>. There are many ways to begin this process. Key action steps include: not building any new coal-burning power plants, initiating a phased shutdown of coal plants starting with the oldest and dirtiest, and capturing and storing <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from power plants. While it may sound like science fiction, the technology exists to store <mark>carbon</mark> emissions underground.  The technology has not been deployed on a large scale or proven to be safe and permanent, but it has been demonstrated in other contexts such as oil and natural gas recovery.  Demonstration projects to test the viability and costs of this technology for power plant emissions are worth pursuing.</LI><LI><STRONG>Managing forests and agriculture</STRONG>: Taken together, tropical deforestation and emissions from agriculture represent nearly 30 percent of the world's heat-trapping emissions. We can fight global warming by reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and by making our food production practices more <mark>sustainable</mark>.</LI><LI><STRONG>Exploring nuclear</STRONG>: Because nuclear power results in few global warming emissions, an increased share of  nuclear power in the energy mix could help reduce global warming—but nuclear technology poses serious threats to our security and, as the accident at the Fukushima Diaichi plant in Japan illustrates to our health and the environment as well. The question remains: can the safety, proliferation, waste disposal, and cost barriers of nuclear power be overcome?</LI><LI><STRONG>Developing and deploying new low-<mark>carbon</mark> and zero-<mark>carbon</mark> technologies</STRONG>: Research into and development of the next generation of low-<mark>carbon</mark> technologies will be critical to deep mid-century reductions in global emissions. Current research on battery technology, new materials for solar cells, harnessing energy from novel sources like bacteria and algae, and other innovative areas could provide important breakthroughs.</LI><LI><STRONG>Ensuring <mark>sustainable</mark> development</STRONG>: The countries of the world—from the most to the least developed—vary dramatically in their contributions to the problem of <mark>climate change</mark> and in their responsibilities and capacities to confront it. A successful global compact on <mark>climate change</mark> must include financial assistance from richer countries to poorer countries to help make the transition to low-<mark>carbon</mark> development pathways and to help adapt to the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</LI></UL><P><STRONG>Adapting to changes already underway</STRONG>: As the <mark>Climate</mark> Hot Map demonstrates, the impacts of a warming world are already being felt by people around the globe. If <mark>climate change</mark> continues unchecked, these impacts are almost certain to get worse. From sea level rise to heat waves, from extreme weather to disease outbreaks, each unique challenge requires locally-suitable solutions to prepare for and respond to the impacts of global warming. Unfortunately, those who will be hit hardest and first by the impacts of a changing <mark>climate</mark> are likely to be the poor and vulnerable, especially those in the least developed countries. Developed countries must take a leadership role in providing financial and technical help for adaptation.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV style=""width:278px; padding-top:20px; padding-bottom:20px;""><DIV class=""openplace-solutions"">Solutions to Global Warming</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

This shift can bring <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation practitioners up to date with the perspective of scientific community and intergovernmental organisations, as the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) moved from a vulnerability to a risk-based conception of <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation in 2012.</P><P>Those in the <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation community have largely used ‘vulnerability’, or the propensity to be affected by hazard, as their frame for understanding and responding to <mark>climate change</mark>. The authors write that, “by labeling people and places as ‘vulnerable’, a passive attitude may be adopted to <mark>climate change</mark>. Similarly, the negative framing overlooks the importance of local culture and underlying resilience, particularly in non-western nations. In short, a vulnerability frame can promote inaction.”</P><P>Risk assessments, on the other hand, focus much more on the real-life consequences of potential hazard and are carried out by important stakeholders for the <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation community, including the health sector, disaster risk managers, and even insurance companies. Risk assessments, the authors write, go beyond impact and vulnerability assessments and bring together different elements of the adaptation agenda to help identify which weather and <mark>climate</mark> risks are most pressing.</P><P>Paradoxically, following the advice of the research community would actually move cities and <mark>climate</mark> practitioners away from relying on the assessment and recommendations of researchers, and would encourage them to share knowledge and input with practitioners in other fields rather than looking to academia for answers. The authors write that “the risk-based concept can help to shift the focus from top-down, science-first vulnerability assessments to risk assessments that can better involve a range of stakeholders and can help to consider <mark>climate change</mark> as one risk along with many other challenges.” This makes considerations of future and often uncertain <mark>climate</mark> risk compatible with practical on-the-ground decision-making across municipal departments and across the city.</P><P>Risk assessment is used by a range of different industries, it is broad and makes room for inclusion of different stakeholders, and it is closer to relevant practice for <mark>climate</mark> adaptation practitioners, particularly disaster risk managers. Even more importantly, it focuses on real consequences, rather than the vague possibility of adverse affects, as is the case for vulnerability. So why is risk not already the first choice for the <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation community? </P><P>Firstly, existing <mark>climate change</mark> assessment projects support a ‘science-first’ vulnerability focus rather than supporting a risk-based approach. Some tools provide information on too broad a scale, while cities need detailed information about small areas, or data coverage is inconsistent across European countries, or tools can only be useful for early planning stages, or they ignore the wider hinterland that cities might be embedded within.</P><P>The European <mark>Climate</mark> Risk Typology, developed as part of the RESIN project, aims to bridge this gap and help cities to move away from vulnerability and towards risk, reaping the benefits of better connections to other sectors and a better grip on real-life consequences. The Typology will help policymakers differentiate different risk elements and will help to show them which issues are driving risk in a particular situation. <mark>Climate</mark> adaptation practitioners interested in contributing to the development of the Typology are invited to join the RESIN Expert Input Group and to participate in a consultation process for the final development stage of this tool.</P><P>More information is available at <A href=""http://www.resin-cities.eu/expert-input-group/"">http://www.resin-cities.eu/expert-input-group/</A>.</P><DIV class=""copyright_info"">Image copyright: <mark>Climate</mark> Risk Typology by &quot;RESIN project&quot;, licensed under All rights reserved</DIV></DIV></DIV><TITLE>Can standardization be useful for <mark>climate</mark> adaptation?</TITLE><DIV class=""news_item""><DIV class=""item_top clearfix"" id=""AmD0P2Zj""><P class=""date"">9 May 2018</P></DIV><DIV class=""news_info clearfix""><H2 class=""blue_header"">Can standardization be useful for <mark>climate</mark> adaptation?</H2><P>The vast majority of commercial products you might encounter on a daily basis have had to pass a variety of standards, from the materials they are composed of, the shape, the packaging and instructions, to the machines that produce them. Most commonly associated with health and safety regulations, and technical equipment such as screws and mobile phone chargers, standardization is becoming increasingly relevant to people-centred processes, such as management. Just as standardizing a mobile phone charger ensures high quality and means that it can be used transferably with many different mobile phones, standardization of soft processes supports collaboration as part of much more complex processes. </P><P>Planning a city to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark> involves the intersection of a number of complex systems, each of which involves unknown, uncertain and unpredictable factors. <mark>Climate</mark> is in itself an incredibly complex system, cities are complex systems, and municipal workers balance all of this complexity with limited budgets, political priorities and practical considerations. Standardization is one way in which municipalities and local councils can create a common language so that they can use the same methods and software as one another for a process as specific as <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation. </P><P>“Cities use standards in their daily work, for example, to determine quality of products and services in their procurement processes,” said Holger Robrecht, ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability. “However, they are not so used to applying standards and norms related to their management procedures, for example, related to <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation or urban resilience. However, whilst a few large cities often have capacity to develop, establish and maintain their tailor-made procedures, the vast majority cannot. They depend on high quality and up-to-date information and reference documents that guide their management of <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation. Standardisation picks upon cutting-edge expertise to provide such guidance.”</P><P>The city of Bratislava (Slovakia) is one city looking to standardized approaches to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>. Bratislava has put a <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation strategy in place to deal with the <mark>climate</mark> challenges the city is facing, such heatwaves and droughts, and has now arrived at the point of developing an action plan to turn the strategy into reality. Gathering data for this process has proven to be a challenge for the city, but real progress is being made, in part thanks to cooperation with universities including the University of Bratislava.</P><P>Bratislava has been applying an Impact and Vulnerability Analysis of Vital Infrastructures and built-up Areas (IVAVIA) tool locally to assess vulnerability on the basis of risk. According to Eva Streberová, <mark>Climate</mark> Adaptation Expert, City of Bratislava (Slovakia), using this tool depends on cooperation between the city council and its stakeholders, providing a range of co-benefits. Bratislava is also a signatory of the Mayors Adapt initiative, whereby the city committed to contributing to the aims of the EU Adaptation Strategy. This commitment is associated with a comprehensive reporting process, and Bratislava has found that using the IVAVIA tool has made this reporting process easier.  </P><P>IVAVIA is a standardized approach to making a vulnerability and risk assessment. It is made up of three qualitative and 3 quantitative steps followed by presentation module. During the IVAVIA process, cities produce impact chain diagrams, which make the cause-effect relationships between the consequences of hazards and exposed objects visible. Later in the process, cities can develop detailed risk maps that can show city councils which areas in the city are in need of particular attention. IVAVIA can help cities not only uncover risk and vulnerability issues affecting them, but can also help to communicate these in a visual way.  </P><P>Greater Manchester (United Kingdom) has also used the IVAVIA method to arrive at systematically mapped risk indicators and indices, with a particular focus on flooding and its repercussions on the transport network. Use of the tool has enabled Greater Manchester to produce an impact chain demonstrating the interactions between pluvial flooding and the system of major arterial roads in Greater Manchester. Developing this impact chain brought transport agency staff into closer working contact with the municipality.</P><P>“The 'beauty' of standards lie in their global availability, hands-on foundation and an inherent regular review mechanism keeping the standard at speed with the generation of knowledge and experience,” said Robrecht. “Being voluntary by nature, cities can 'pick and choose' what fits best to strengthen their <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation management.”</P><P>These outcomes were shared at the RESIN project’s session, “Standardized support tools for urban resilience, integrating resilience planning into local decision-making” at the Bonn Resilient Cities conference, 27 April 2018.</P></DIV></DIV><TITLE>RESIN General Assembly meeting, Sankt Augustin (Germany)</TITLE><DIV class=""news_item""><DIV class=""item_top clearfix"" id=""MhqGJVv3""><P class=""date"">4 May 2018</P></DIV><DIV class=""news_info clearfix""><H2 class=""blue_header"">RESIN General Assembly meeting, Sankt Augustin (Germany)</H2><P>The RESIN consortium met in Sankt Augustin (Germany) last week for its final General Assembly. The four core cities of the RESIN project presented their recent work and discussed their perspective on the co-creation process within RESIN.</P><P>The city of Paris presented the Paris Adaptation Strategy. “Paris is one of the Tier 1 cities of the RESIN project, along with Bratislava, Manchester and Bilbao,” said Marie Gantois, City of Paris. “We were looking forward to exchanging experience and also to see how we could contribute to shaping some tools for cities regarding adaptation to <mark>climate change</mark> and potentially also learn from it's at a different scale.</P><P>What happened in Paris is that we already had an adaptation strategy at the whole city scale and we wanted to use RESIN to test other tools for adaptation to <mark>climate change</mark> at smaller scales, and that is what's been tested in the RESIN project.”</P><P>As part of the city’s updated adaptation strategy, the city aims to address <mark>climate</mark>-related challenges, including heat, especially the urban heat island effect and heat waves, flooding and intense rainfall, droughts and water scarcity, and lastly energy scarcity. The strategy includes 65 measures, many of which are oriented towards heat mitigation and improving thermal comfort.</P><P>The city of Bratislava has been reaching out to stakeholders who are expected to be affected by <mark>climate change</mark>. The city will also build on its successful programme of subsidies for implementing <mark>sustainable</mark> rainwater measures, which has been offered to citizens for the last two years and will continue into a third. The city is seeking nature-based solution options for adaptation to <mark>climate change</mark> and is currently monitoring temperatures in different areas of the city to identify effective adaptation options.</P><P>The city of Bilbao has fed outputs from the RESIN co-creation process into the preparation of its recent <mark>Sustainable</mark> Mobility Plan. A risk analysis at a small scale was also made possible through the RESIN project, as grid analysis of risk areas was prepared by RESIN researchers on the city’s request at a detailed resolution.</P><P>Greater Manchester has been able to develop composite risk maps as a result of engagement in the RESIN project. Involvement of stakeholders and building cooperative relationships has been a meaningful output of the project. In Greater Manchester’s case, flood risk is the most immediately pressing <mark>climate</mark> adaptation challenge, and this field has provided an in-road into consideration of other interrelationships of <mark>climate</mark> and risk in the city.</P><P>A number of RESIN tools; the European <mark>Climate</mark> Risk Typology, the Impact and vulnerability analysis (IVAVIA) tool, the Adaptation Options Library and the latest release of the RESIN e-Guide were presented in an interactive rotating cycle of demonstration and discussion sessions.</P><DIV class=""copyright_info"">Image copyright: Image by &quot;Fraunhofer IAIS&quot;, licensed under Copyright Fraunhofer IAIS</DIV></DIV></DIV><TITLE>RESIN project co-organises Open European Day</TITLE><DIV class=""news_item""><DIV class=""item_top clearfix"" id=""vqh6NJBo""><P class=""date"">3 May 2018</P></DIV><DIV class=""news_info clearfix""><H2 class=""blue_header"">RESIN project co-organises Open European Day</H2><P>155 local government representatives, <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation experts and local and national government representatives convened in Bonn on 25th April 2018 to meet other city representatives for peer-based discussions on <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation.</P><P>Reinhard Limbach, Deputy Mayor of the city of Bonn, hosts of the event, said: “To be prepared for future incidents, we must create suitable technical infrastructure and work on an innovative, nature-based strategy… I find it so important to come together and to make use of the elaborated European system, to benefit from the exchange with our direct neighbours.”</P><P>As the event, organized by ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability and the European Environment Agency, has grown over five editions, European institutions are seeing the value in joining the conversation with local governments.</P><P>“What regional organizations do, the country does, or even the European Union does, matters for cities,” said Birgit Georgi, Strong Cities in a Changing <mark>Climate</mark>. “They build a framework in which the cities connect, and so we started to invite more and more also these levels, like from the European Commission or national governments or regional governments and other supporters, because as cities cannot move alone forward to be more resilient, national governments, you cannot without these cities.

Silje Solvang, city of Kristiansand, said, &quot;The most valuable outcome of our participation in the SMR project has been the cross-sectoral collaboration, which is essential for resilience.&quot; City representatives emphasised the need for access to data, which is only provided by privately owned critical infrastructure providers when the latter is legally obliged to do so. </P><P>SMR project coordinator Jose Maria Sarriegi summarized the outcomes of the panel by notin gthat cooperation is essential for resilience, there is a challenge in communicating resilience, resilience is not only about technology and must include soft factors, there is a need for funding to facilitate further work, and finally, there is a need for the tools and methods produced to be adaptable to changing circumstances.</P><P>The European Resilience Management Guidelines and the associated tools were showcased at the Critical Infrastructure Resilience 2018 Conference, which took place on Tuesday 10th April from 09.00 to 16.00 at the Research Executive Agency (Covent Garden), Place Rogier, Brussels.</P><P>Attendees, including policy makers, resilience managers and practitioners, heard from resilience experts and end-users across the five projects on topics such as, Resilience Interventions Tools and Benefits; Resilience Policy, Standardisation and Current Needs; and Status, Further Needs and Roadmap to Integration.</P><P>The five projects are part of the EU’s Horizon 2020 research and <mark>innovation</mark> programme and cooperate together under crisis management topic 7: ‘crisis and disaster resilience –operationalising resilience concepts (DRS-7)’.</P><P>Download the <A href=""http://smr-project.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/Documents/Resources/WP_7/DRS_7_WHITE_PAPER_final_April2018.pdf"">white paper here</A>.</P><DIV class=""copyright_info"">Image copyright: Angelo Marino, Head of Unit, Security Research, Research Executive Agency, European Commission welcomes participants to the even by &quot;Octavian Carare&quot;, licensed under Critical Infrastructure Resilience 2018</DIV></DIV></DIV><TITLE>Cities are where global problems can be solved: outcomes of the 27th Breakfast at Sustainability’s – Boosting local progress in city resilience development</TITLE><DIV class=""news_item""><DIV class=""item_top clearfix"" id=""UPBHSzou""><P class=""date"">20 March 2018</P></DIV><DIV class=""news_info clearfix""><H2 class=""blue_header"">Cities are where global problems can be solved: outcomes of the 27th Breakfast at Sustainability’s – Boosting local progress in city resilience development</H2><P>Representatives of over 30 cities and regions in Europe, the European Commission and scientific experts on resilience attended the 27th edition of ICLEI Europe’s Breakfast at Sustainability’s series. The event was hosted by the European office of the Basque Country and a welcome address was provided by – Ignacio de la Puerta, Director for Urban Planning of the Basque Government. A brief introduction to the Smart Mature Resilience project and its tools was provided by Vasileios Latinos, ICLEI Europe.</P><P>Mr de la Puerta emphasised in his words of welcome the need to provide space and quality of life for Basque residents. An integrated action plan, as well as participation in numerous local, regional and international projects and programmes, such as Donostia/San Sebastián’s participation in the Smart Mature Resilience Project are addressing this need. The path is a shared one and cities in Europe are welcome to join the Basque Country on this journey by considering the pathways towards transformative action laid out in the <A href=""http://www.<mark>sustainable</mark>cities.eu/about-the-basque-declaration/"">Basque Declaration</A>.</P><P>Cities must work together in a coordinated way towards long-term resilience goals. For Ben Caspar, Team Leader for Urban Environment for the European Commission’s DG Environment, cities have enormous potential to overcome global challenges. The Pact of Amsterdam has made funding streams easier to understand and has led to enhanced support and cooperation between the European Commission and city networks. As well as funding the European Commission offers other resources to cities, including online tools, such as a new portal planned to be launched during Green Week. Ronny Frederickx, Former President and Good Governance Project Leader, UDITE considered resilience from the perspective of good governance, and warned that lack of trust in political leaders, lack of capacity and ‘segregation in craftsmanship’ or lack of cooperation as drivers of risk. He called for a good governance approach in order to overcome these challenges, as well as for a triangle between science, education and practice.</P><P>The innovative and inspiring “Room for the river Waal” project saw attitudes among citizens to the large-scale project turn from hostility and resistance, to sentiments among citizens of pride and ownership of the project. Ton Verhoeven, Arnhem Nijmegen City Region, Netherlands shared how this was achieved through intensive communication and engagement of stakeholders.</P><P>Glasgow and Rome are working together on their resilience journey: both cities are part of the <A href=""http://www.smr-project.eu"">Smart Mature Resilience</A> project as well as ICLEI members and members of 100 Resilient Cities. Frankie Barrett, Glasgow City Council and Claudio Bordi, Risorse per Roma. Public authorities in Glasgow are as of recently obliged to involve communities as part of their work, and ongoing projects range across numerous topical areas, for example food security and land use. In Glasgow’s experience, &quot;When citizens are not involved in the plan, it will fail.&quot; Rome has used a tool produced by the Smart Mature Resilience project, the Risk Systemicity Questionnaire, to hold cross-sectoral meetings with a goal to break silos and better understand risk.</P><P>Annette Figueiredo, Greater London Authority described a recently concluded audit of school air quality in London. Poor air quality has detrimental effects on children’s learning, and a survey revealed that over 360 schools were in poor air quality areas. The Mayor of London, as part of a vision to clean up London’s air received a petition from Greenpeace signed by 303 teachers calling for better air quality near schools, and fifty schools were selected.  The project involved the cooperation of the relevant boroughs, Transport for London, Public Health and other Greater London Authority programmes working with schools, researchers and academics. The collected data will be used in the schools’ curricula so that students can understand how it affects their lives.</P><P>For the second part of the day, Serene Hanania, ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability, invited cities to participate in an interactive workshop. Discussion groups considered topics such as heat waves, flood risks, social issues and emergency response and exchanged their experiences from their respective cities on the topics. The SMR project representatives then demonstrated how the tools co-produced in the project by cities and researchers could support the newcomer cities in overcoming the challenges they raised in the discussions.</P><P>In terms of flooding, cross-departmental silos were found to be a major challenge in British cities, as management of water courses was not closely linked to response mechanisms, and vulnerable groups were found to be more exposed to flood risk. Here, Nijmegen could explain their unique case, where better communication on water planning and management is possible due to Dutch water boards. The SMR <A href=""http://agder-ikt78.uia.no/cityrd45/"">City Resilience Dynamics</A> tool was mentioned in a possible application to measure surface water interventions.</P><P>On the subject of heat waves, desertification and the benefits of reforestation were discussed for cities in Spain. In Italy, paradoxically, abandonment of agricultural areas and increase of rain has led to natural reforestation. The most vulnerable cities to heat waves were considered to be Athens and Rome. Here, the <A href=""http://smr-project.eu/tools/risk-systemicity-questionnaire/"">Risk Systemicity Questionnaire</A> was recommended, as awareness of the risk of heat waves seriously underestimates the real mortality rate among elderly people during periods of extreme heat. Malmö, Sweden, expressed the benefits of exchanging with Southern cities with cultural experience of caring for the elderly during heat waves, as heat stress is becoming an increasing problem for Malmö. Here, better access to data on mortality rates would be helpful to gain political support for, elderly, patient and hospice care to take additional measures during heat waves.</P><P>A common feature of the cities was the importance of involving volunteers and NGOs in emergency response. While cities and municipalities must adhere to standards, guidelines and norms for emergency response, citizens can step in and provide non-professional support magnanimously, for example providing unofficial transport and meals to refugees. Dedicated policies for involving NGOs and volunteers are included in the <A href=""http://smr-project.eu/tools/maturity-model-guide/"">Resilience Maturity Model</A>.</P><P>IT solutions offer interesting innovative ways to prevent food waste and to build communities in new way. Representative democracy and transparent decision-making were considered to be crucial foundations for social resilience. Decreasing vulnerability is intricately connected to employment, and in the case of French regions, citizens can become alienated as a result of unemployment. </P><P>The cities present shared many aspects and practices around emergency response. Most cities had emergency plans and the same way of responding to an emergency. Malmö provided another perspective, for example, that experts were called in the event of a crisis. In each of the cities, in many cases, those working in emergency response have other responsibilities under normal circumstances, where response takes preference over these duties during a crisis. Risk assessment was considered essential, and the SMR Risk Systemicity Questionnaire is available to be used as part of this process.</P><P>A photo gallery of the event is available at <A href=""https://flic.kr/s/aHsmeXRgWi"">https://flic.kr/s/aHsmeXRgWi</A>.</P></DIV></DIV><TITLE>European cities are working against the clock to adapt to the new <mark>climate</mark> reality</TITLE><DIV class=""news_item""><DIV class=""item_top clearfix"" id=""FKSEZiGF""><P class=""date"">19 March 2018</P></DIV><DIV class=""news_info clearfix""><H2 class=""blue_header"">European cities are working against the clock to adapt to the new <mark>climate</mark> reality</H2><P>City council teams in Bratislava (Slovakia) and Manchester (UK) have teamed up with the cities of Paris (France), Bilbao (Spain), top European researchers,  and city network ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability to make their cities and critical infrastructures more resilient to the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.  </P><P>A new <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM6kRktJBJg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">short film</A> has been launched today showing how Manchester and Bratislava are working with a team of cities and scientists to help municipalities to adapt to a rapidly-changing <mark>climate</mark>. A second period of unprecedented snow across Europe this weekend following the “Beast from the East” earlier this month has shown that extreme weather is becoming the new normal.“What was good enough in the past, and maybe 10 years ago, it’s not enough for the future,” said Martina Tichá, Head of Project Management Unit, Strategy and Projects Department at Bratislava City Hall. Bratislava, where an orange alert was raised due to freezing temperatures this Saturday, can expect extreme heat as early as May this year.</P><P>As most of Europe’s population lives in cities, city councils across Europe desperately need new ways of working to understand the risks they face and to prepare for the unknown. “The decision makers in Greater Manchester need to know key issues and why they should do something about it,” said Matthew Ellis, <mark>Climate</mark> Resilience Officer, Greater Manchester Combined Authority.</P><P>“Every job within a local authority will be impacted by <mark>climate change</mark> in the future: every decision that's made will need to take account of what the future <mark>climate change</mark> risks might be,” said Mark Atherton, Director of Environment, Greater Manchester Combined Authority.</P><P>RESIN - <mark>Climate</mark> Resilient Cities and Infrastructures has been developing innovative tools in a process of ‘co-creation’ between cities, <mark>climate</mark> scientists and ICLEI since 2015. In Manchester in February 2018, the project held an event to share the new tools with representatives of over 15 cities.  </P><P>“You don't have to reinvent the wheel, you can use these tools because you can be sure they have been tested and they have the best current knowledge available from different European research institutions and cities, that deal with problems just like your city is probably dealing with,” said Eva Streberová (PhD), Environmental Manager, Office of the Chief City Architect, Bratislava City.</P><P>The latest versions of these tools will be launched at the end of this month. Prototypes are already available on the project website, <A href=""http://www.resin-cities.eu/home/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">www.resin-cities.eu</A>. The tools will be presented at Open European Day on 25th April 2018, which is organised by ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability and the European Environment Agency and co-organised by the RESIN project.</P><P>For more information about the RESIN project, click <A href=""http://www.resin-cities.eu/home/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</A>.</P><DIV class=""copyright_info"">Image copyright: Image (RESIN Project) by &quot;RESIN Project&quot;</DIV></DIV></DIV><TITLE>CitiesIPCC marks new era for cooperation between science and cities on <mark>climate change</mark>: and the RESIN project is part of it</TITLE><DIV class=""news_item""><DIV class=""item_top clearfix"" id=""756dfe80""><P class=""date"">2 March 2018</P></DIV><DIV class=""news_info clearfix""><H2 class=""blue_header"">CitiesIPCC marks new era for cooperation between science and cities on <mark>climate change</mark>: and the RESIN project is part of it</H2><P>A global <mark>climate</mark> research agenda will be announced at the Cities and <mark>Climate Change</mark> Science Conference next week in Edmonton.</P><P>In an article published this week in Nature in the lead-up to the conference, leading <mark>climate</mark> experts identified among the most pressing priorities for cities and <mark>climate</mark>-change research, “Comparative studies are needed… in different contexts to disentangle these interactions and to find solutions.

RESIN has been working with cities since 2015 to co-create tools for adaptation planning in European cities. 

Manchester in the north of England is facing rainier days and unpredictable weather. The event day saw wildly changeable weather, reflecting the agenda for the day: how just one place (and one project) can be a meeting point for common conditions in otherwise diverse locations. Even sunny southern cities could find common ground with Manchester. Ileana Luminița Balalau, Project Manager, Environmental Protection Agency Covasna, said, “We are facing heat waves and also floods.” Mark Atherton, Director of Environment, Greater Manchester, has gone through the same experience during “Boxing Day floods two years ago, where in the space of 24 hours we had several months’ worth, almost, of rainfall.” 

City spotlights: flooding

The City of Lahti (Finland) is focusing on adapting to potential flooding from stormwater in densely built and non-permeable areas, especially the city centre. “We are interested in hearing how the RESIN tools can support our strategic adaptation plan and citizen-involved processes,” said Eira Rosberg, <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Coordinator for Lahti. Newcastle’s biggest challenge is not from river flooding but from surface water flooding or flash flooding. In a shocking picture painted by Newcastle City Council’s Helen Hinds and John Robinson, “we had a month’s worth of rainfall in a very short space of time: the city ground to a halt” and “at least 500 properties were affected.” 

For Reykjavik,”The main adaptation challenge that we are facing is sea level rise.” Major risk factors, including areas prone to flooding, will be introduced into the district plan and a plan will be formed for necessary counter measures. Reykjavik aims to be <mark>carbon</mark> neutral by 2040, but, “the main challenge is breaking people out of silos to work together to solve adaptation challenges.”

Researchers respond

The RESIN <mark>Climate</mark> Risk Typology will be an interactive online portal that support adaptation planning by offering users the means to describe, compare and analyse <mark>climate</mark> risk in European cities and regions. <mark>Climate</mark> risk encompasses many social and demographic factors that are important and interesting to citizens. As Burgas representatives pointed out, the facility to display different statistics about a region’s specific social and demographic conditions that contribute to <mark>climate</mark> risk can be a particularly useful tool for dissemination and awareness-raising among citizens. A risk-based Vulnerability Assessment using IVAVIA (Impact and vulnerability analysis for critical infrastructures and built-up areas) helps cities identify geographical risk and vulnerability hotspots, understand the cause-effect relationships of <mark>climate change</mark>, and assess its demographic, economic and local impacts now and for the future. This helps identify entry-points for adaptation measures and areas where priority action is needed. IVAVIA has been applied to the RESIN core city of Bilbao with regard to flooding. 

Maddalen Mendizabal of Tecnalia offered the cities suffering from floods and heat stress some suggestions for finding replicable case studies. The RESIN Adaptation Options Library draws together hundreds of relevant papers and study cases on the performance of <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation measures in a database covering measures relating to heat, pluvial, fluvial and coastal floods, and drought – among other things. Once complete, each of the tools will be hosted in an online decision support system called the e-Guide. The e-Guide will accompany and support cities throughout their adaptation processes, allows practitioners to save their progress and relevant documentation in one online space, and providing convenient access to content supporting this process, including the remaining three tools developed by RESIN. 

Getting to know the tools – and taking them forward

The Manchester event was a “dialogue” with two-way exchange and learning encouraged throughout the day. After two rounds of discussion, the afternoon focused on practical encounters with the tools under development in the RESIN tools marketplace. Cities visited parallel stations where the tool developers addressed their questions, proposed useful applications for their unique contexts and demonstrated their use. 

The next release of the RESIN tools will take place in March 2018.

The gases trap heat within the atmosphere, which can have a range of effects on ecosystems, including rising sea levels, severe weather events, and droughts that render landscapes more susceptible to wildfires.</P><H3>Is <mark>climate change</mark> real?</H3><P>There is broad-based agreement within the scientific community that <mark>climate change</mark> is real. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration concur that <mark>climate change</mark> is indeed occurring and is almost certainly due to human activity.</P><H3>What are the causes of <mark>climate change</mark>?</H3><P>The primary cause of <mark>climate change</mark> is the burning of fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, which emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere—primarily <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. Other human activities, such as agriculture and deforestation, also contribute to the proliferation of greenhouse gases that cause <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>While some quantities of these gases are a naturally occurring and critical part of Earth’s temperature control system, the atmospheric concentration of CO<SUB>2</SUB> did not rise above 300 parts per million between the advent of human civilization roughly 10,000 years ago and 1900. Today it is at about 400 ppm, a level not reached in more than 400,000 years.</P><FIGURE class=""inline-content-image image-none align-right""><FIGCAPTION><P>Increased burning of fossil fuels contributes to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>(Photo: Chris Conway/Getty Images)</P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H3>What are the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>?</H3><P>Even small increases in Earth’s temperature caused by <mark>climate change</mark> can have severe effects. The earth’s average temperature has gone up 1.4° F over the past century and is expected to rise as much as 11.5° F over the next. That might not seem like a lot, but the average temperature during the last Ice Age was about 4º F lower than it is today.</P><P>Rising sea levels due to the melting of the polar ice caps (again, caused by <mark>climate change</mark>) contribute to greater storm damage; warming ocean temperatures are associated with stronger and more frequent storms; additional rainfall, particularly during severe weather events, leads to flooding and other damage; an increase in the incidence and severity of wildfires threatens habitats, homes, and lives; and heat waves contribute to human deaths and other consequences.</P><H3><mark>Climate change</mark>: the debate</H3><P>While consensus among nearly all scientists, scientific organizations, and governments is that <mark>climate change</mark> is happening and is caused by human activity, a small minority of voices questions the validity of such assertions and prefers to cast doubt on the preponderance of evidence. <mark>Climate change</mark> deniers often claim that recent changes attributed to human activity can be seen as part of the natural variations in Earth’s <mark>climate</mark> and temperature, and that it is difficult or impossible to establish a direct connection between <mark>climate change</mark> and any single weather event, such as a hurricane. While the latter is generally true, decades of data and analysis support the reality of <mark>climate change</mark>—and the human factor in this process. In any case, economists agree that acting to reduce fossil fuel emissions would be far less expensive than dealing with the consequences of not doing so.</P><P><STRONG>What flashcards would you like to see?</STRONG><A href=""mailto:editorial@takepart.com?subject=New%20Flashcard%20Request"">Email us</A> or let us know in the <A href=""#block-tp-flashcards-flashcard-comments"">comments</A> below.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""footer-wrapper""><FOOTER id=""footer"" class=""region region-footer""><DIV id=""block-bean-featured-campaigns-module"" class=""block block-bean first odd featured-campaigns-module-wrapper""><H2 class=""block__title block-title section-header"">Featured Projects</H2></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

But it’s safe to say that many key economic sectors – from fishing to energy to water utilities – will feel long-term impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>. From warming seas, which encourage proliferation of non-native species that impact fishing industries, to rising temperatures, which impact energy usage around the world, our shifting global <mark>climate</mark> will force many industries to move quickly to adapt to change.  Even recreation and tourism industries are weather-dependent – with many planning based on historic weather patterns, which <mark>climate change</mark> will disrupt. As we move into an era in which <mark>climate change</mark> impacts are all around us, adapting to these changes quickly will be key for all sectors of the global economy. </P></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

(And yes, it's really happening.) Over the past 50 years, the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history. And experts see the trend is accelerating: All but one of the 16 hottest years in NASA’s 134-year record have occurred <A href=""https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201513"">since 2000</A>.</P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> deniers have argued that there has been a “pause” or a “slowdown” in rising global temperatures, but several recent studies, including a <A href=""http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1469"">2015 paper</A> published in the journal Science, have disproved this claim. And scientists say that unless we curb global-warming emissions, average U.S. temperatures could increase by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.</P><H4 id=""causes"">Q: What causes global warming?</H4><P><STRONG>A:</STRONG> Global warming occurs when <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>) and other air pollutants and greenhouse gases collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth’s surface. Normally, this radiation would escape into space—but these pollutants, which can last for years to centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause the planet to get hotter. That's what's known as the greenhouse effect.</P><P>In the United States, the burning of fossil fuels to make electricity is the largest source of heat-trapping <mark>pollution</mark>, producing about two billion tons of <mark>CO2</mark> every year. Coal-burning power plants are by far the biggest polluters. The country’s second-largest source of <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> is the transportation sector, which generates about 1.7 billion tons of <mark>CO2</mark> emissions a year.</P><P>Curbing dangerous <A href=""/issues/<mark>climate</mark>-change""><mark>climate change</mark></A> requires very deep cuts in emissions, as well as the use of alternatives to fossil fuels worldwide. The good news is that we’ve started a turnaround: <mark>CO2</mark> emissions in the United States actually decreased from 2005 to 2014, thanks in part to new, energy-efficient technology and the use of cleaner fuels. And scientists continue to develop new ways to modernize power plants, generate cleaner electricity, and burn less gasoline while we drive. The challenge is to be sure these solutions are put to use and widely adopted.</P><H4 id=""weather"">Q: How is global warming linked to extreme weather?</H4><P><STRONG>A:</STRONG> Scientists agree that the earth’s rising temperatures are fueling longer and hotter heat waves, more frequent droughts, heavier rainfall, and more powerful hurricanes. In 2015, for example, scientists said that an ongoing drought in California—the state’s worst water shortage in 1,200 years—had been intensified by 15 percent to 20 percent by global warming. They also said the odds of similar droughts happening in the future had roughly doubled over the past century. And in 2016, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine announced that it’s now possible to confidently attribute certain weather events, like some heat waves, directly to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The earth’s ocean temperatures are getting warmer, too—which means that tropical storms can pick up more energy. So global warming could turn, say, a category 3 storm into a more dangerous category 4 storm. In fact, scientists have found that the frequency of North Atlantic hurricanes has <A href=""http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-<mark>climate</mark>/changes-hurricanes"">increased</A> since the early 1980s, as well as the number of storms that reach categories 4 and 5. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina—the costliest hurricane in U.S. history—struck New Orleans; the second-costliest, Hurricane Sandy, hit the East Coast in 2012.</P><P>The impacts of global warming are being felt across the globe. Extreme heat waves have caused tens of thousands of deaths around the world in recent years. And in an alarming sign of events to come, Antarctica has been losing about 134 billion metric tons of ice per year since 2002. This rate could speed up if we keep burning fossil fuels at our current pace, some experts say, causing sea levels to rise several meters over the next 50 to 150 years.</P><H4 id=""effects"">Q: What are the other effects of global warming?</H4><P><STRONG>A:</STRONG> Each year, scientists learn more about the <A href=""/stories/are-effects-global-warming-really-bad"">consequences of global warming</A>, and many agree that environmental, economic, and health consequences are likely to occur if current trends continue. Here’s just a smattering of what we can look forward to:</P><UL><LI>Melting glaciers, early snowmelt, and severe droughts will cause more dramatic water shortages and increase the risk of wildfires in the American West.</LI><LI>Rising sea levels will lead to coastal flooding on the Eastern Seaboard, especially in Florida, and in other areas such as the Gulf of Mexico.</LI><LI>Forests, farms, and cities will face troublesome new pests, heat waves, heavy downpours, and increased flooding. All those factors will damage or destroy agriculture and fisheries.</LI><LI>Disruption of habitats such as coral reefs and Alpine meadows could drive many plant and animal species to extinction.</LI><LI>Allergies, asthma, and infectious disease outbreaks will become more common due to increased growth of <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/<mark>climate</mark>-change-and-health-air-quality"">pollen-producing ragweed</A>, higher levels of <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/stories/air-<mark>pollution</mark>-everything-you-need-know"">air <mark>pollution</mark></A>, and the spread of conditions favorable to pathogens and mosquitoes.</LI></UL><H4 id=""contribute"">Q: Where does the United States stand in terms of global-warming contributors?</H4><P><STRONG>A:</STRONG> In recent years, China has taken the lead in global-warming <mark>pollution</mark>, producing about <A href=""https://www3.epa.gov/<mark>climate</mark>change/ghgemissions/global.html#four"">28 percent</A> of all <mark>CO2</mark> emissions. The United States comes in second. Despite making up just 4 percent of the world’s population, we produce a whopping 16 percent of all global <mark>CO2</mark> emissions—as much as the European Union and India (third and fourth place) combined. And America is still number one, by far, in cumulative emissions over the past 150 years. Our responsibility matters to other countries, and it should matter to us, too.</P><H4 id=""prevention"">Q: Is the United States doing anything to prevent global warming?</H4><P><STRONG>A:</STRONG> We’ve started. But in order to avoid the worst effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, we need to do a lot more—together with other countries—to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and start using clean energy instead.</P><P>In 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pledged to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> from our power plants by nearly a third by 2030, relative to 2005 levels, through its Clean Power Plan. But fast-forward to 2017, and under the Trump Administration, the EPA <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/media/2017/171009"">proposed repealing</A> this critical tool for curbing <mark>climate change</mark>. Likewise, while under the Obama administration, the U.S. Department of Transportation proposed <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> and fuel economy standards intended to cut emissions through the 2020s, under Trump administration, the DOT is working to <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/luke-tonachel/states-boost-trump-rolls-back-clean-vehicles-2017"">roll back those clean vehicle safeguards</A> that protect the <mark>climate</mark> and our health.  </P><P>Fortunately, state leaders—including in <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/luke-tonachel/ohio-indiana-tennessee-want-strong-fuel-economy-standards"">car country</A> itself—recognize that clean transportation must remain a priority if we are to address the costly risks of <mark>climate change</mark> and protect public health. And regional efforts around the country are helping to <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/luke-tonachel/states-boost-trump-rolls-back-clean-vehicles-2017"">boost the electric car market</A>, which saw an increase in sales for 2017 over 2016. Our <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/elizabeth-noll/state-clean-energy-strong"">clean energy economy is growing</A> too, despite federal efforts to derail it. In 2016, wind employment grew by 32 percent and solar jobs increased by 25 percent.</P><P>Globally, at the United Nations Conference on <mark>Climate Change</mark> in Paris, 195 countries—including the United States, at the time—agreed to <mark>pollution</mark>-cutting provisions with a goal of preventing the average global temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times. (Scientists say we must stay below a two-degree increase to avoid catastrophic <mark>climate</mark> impacts.)</P><P>To help make the deal happen, the Obama administration pledged $3 billion to the Green <mark>Climate</mark> Fund, an international organization dedicated to helping poor countries adopt cleaner energy technologies. Under the terms of the Paris agreement, participating nations will meet every five years, starting in 2020, to revise their plans for cutting <mark>CO2</mark> emissions. Beginning in 2023, they will also have to publicly report their progress.</P><P>While in 2017, President Trump announced the country’s withdrawal from the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement and to eliminate “harmful and unnecessary policies such as the <mark>Climate</mark> Action Plan,” Americans are forging ahead without him. Through initiatives like the United States <mark>Climate</mark> Alliance, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, We Are Still In, and <mark>Climate</mark> Mayors, state, business, and local leaders have pledged to honor and uphold the goals of the Paris Agreement. More than 25 cities in 17 states, with populations totaling more than 5 million have <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/shelley-poticha/cities-stand-united-paris-agreement-cop-23"">adopted resolutions</A> that will enable them to get 100 percent of their electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar.</P><H4 id=""tackle"">Q: Is global warming too big of a problem for me to help tackle?</H4><P><STRONG>A:</STRONG> Wondering <A href=""/stories/how-you-can-stop-global-warming"">how to stop global warming</A>? Reduce your own <mark>carbon</mark> footprint by following a few easy steps. Make conserving energy a part of your daily routine and your decisions as a consumer. When you shop for new appliances like refrigerators, washers, and dryers, look for products with the government’s Energy Star label; they meet a higher standard for energy efficiency than the minimum federal requirements. When you buy a car, look for one with the highest gas mileage and lowest emissions. You can also reduce your emissions by taking public transportation or carpooling when possible.</P><P>And while new federal and state standards are a step in the right direction, much more needs to be done. <A href=""https://secure.nrdconline.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&amp;page=UserAction&amp;id=3819&amp;s_src=WBLCPPPETNONFORM"">Voice your support</A> of <mark>climate</mark>-friendly and <mark>climate change</mark> preparedness policies, and tell your representatives that transitioning from dirty fossil fuels to clean power should be a top priority—because it’s vital to building healthy, more secure communities.</P><DIV class=""embed""><DIV class=""action-promo-wrap""><DIV class=""l-1up-promo clearfix""><DIV class=""oneup-promo-text-wrap eq-col""><DIV class=""oneup-promo-text""><H2>Stop Trump and Pruitt’s escalated anti-environment assault</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SPAN></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

However, it is believed that global dimming caused the droughts in Ethiopia in the 1970s and 80s where millions died, because the northern hemisphere oceans were not warm enough to allow rain formation. Global dimming is also hiding the true power of global warming. By cleaning up global dimming-causing pollutants without tackling greenhouse gas emissions, rapid warming has been observed, and various human health and ecological disasters have resulted, as witnessed during the European heat wave in 2003, which saw thousands of people die.</P></SECTION><SECTION class=""page-intro""><H2><A href=""/article/805/cop20-lima-<mark>climate</mark>-conference"">COP20—Lima <mark>Climate</mark> Conference</A></H2><P class=""page-intro-summary-info"">Posted Saturday, January 24, 2015.</P><P> An overview of the <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference (also known as COP 20), held in Lima, Peru in December 2014.</P><P>While it seemed like it was a successful meeting, because developing nations were committed to drawing up their own plans for emissions reductions for the first time, a number of important issues were left undecided such as how financing would work.</P><P>This page is an overview of the Lima <mark>Climate</mark> conference.</P></SECTION><SECTION class=""page-intro""><H2><A href=""/article/803/cop19-warsaw-<mark>climate</mark>-conference"">COP19—Warsaw <mark>Climate</mark> Conference</A></H2><P class=""page-intro-summary-info"">Posted Monday, December 02, 2013.</P><P>An overview of the <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference (also known as COP 19), held in Warsaw, Poland in November 2013.</P><P>Predictably and sadly, the same issues have resurfaced: West stalling on doing anything, lack of funding, disagreement on priorities, etc.</P><P>This page is an overview of the Warsaw <mark>Climate</mark> conference.</P></SECTION><SECTION class=""page-intro""><H2><A href=""/article/801/cop18-doha-<mark>climate</mark>-conference"">COP18—Doha <mark>Climate</mark> Conference</A></H2><P class=""page-intro-summary-info"">Posted Sunday, December 02, 2012.</P><P> An overview of the <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference (also known as COP 18), held in Doha, Qatar in December 2012.</P><P>Predictably and sadly, the same issues have resurfaced: lack of media coverage, West stalling on doing anything, lack of funding, disagreement on how to address it, etc.</P><P>This page is an overview of the Doha <mark>Climate</mark> conference.</P></SECTION><SECTION class=""page-intro""><H2><A href=""/article/797/cop17-durban-<mark>climate</mark>-conference"">COP17—Durban <mark>Climate</mark> Conference</A></H2><P class=""page-intro-summary-info"">Posted Wednesday, January 04, 2012.</P><P> An overview of the <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference (also known as COP 17), held in Durban, South Africa in December 2011.</P><P>Predictably and sadly, the same issues have resurfaced: lack of media coverage, West stalling on doing anything trying to blame India and China instead, lack of funding, disagreement on how to address it, etc.</P><P>Geopolitical threats (real and imaginary) quickly focus a lot of political will and money is easily found to mobilize military forces when needed.</P><P>The economy also takes center stage as the current pressing issue, while <mark>climate change</mark> is easily deferred, in the hopes that the West can let China and India pick up the burden of addressing emissions even though they have not contributed to the historical build up of emissions that have started the recent changes in the <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>This page is an overview of the Durban conference.</P></SECTION><SECTION class=""page-intro""><H2><A href=""/article/791/cop16-cancun-<mark>climate</mark>-conference"">COP16—Cancún <mark>Climate</mark> Conference</A></H2><P class=""page-intro-summary-info"">Posted Tuesday, January 04, 2011.</P><P> An overview of the <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference (also known as COP 16), held in Cancún, Mexico in the December 2010.</P><P>This conference came a year after the Copenhagen conference which promised so much but offered so little.

And despite this reckless move, American <SPAN>mayors, state leaders, county officials, governors, major companies, and millions of citizens across our country have pledged that they're <A href=""http://wearestillin.com/"">&quot;still in&quot;</A> when it comes to the agreement, and supporting the goal </SPAN>of limiting future warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius.</P><P>It’s important to remember the equally vital contributions that can be made by private citizens—which is to say, by you. “Change only happens when individuals take action,” <A href=""/experts/aliya-haq"">Aliya Haq</A>, deputy director of NRDC’s Clean Power Plan initiative, says. “There’s no other way, if it doesn’t start with people.”</P><P>The goal is simple. <mark>Carbon</mark> dioxide is the <mark>climate</mark>’s worst enemy. It’s released when oil, coal, and other fossil fuels are burned for energy—the energy we use to power our homes, cars, and smartphones. By using less of it, we can curb our own contribution to <mark>climate change</mark> while also saving money. Here are a dozen easy, effective ways each one of us can make a difference:</P><H4>1. Speak up!</H4><P>What’s the single biggest way you can make an impact on global <mark>climate change</mark>? “Talk to your friends and family, and make sure your representatives are making good decisions,” Haq says. By voicing your concerns—via social media or, better yet, <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/stories/how-call-congress"">directly to your elected officials</A>—you send a message that you care about the warming world. Encourage Congress to enact new laws that limit <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and require polluters to pay for the emissions they produce. “The main reason elected officials do anything difficult is because their constituents make them,” Haq says. You can help protect public lands, stop offshore drilling, and more <A href=""http://nrdclivepantheon.jacksonriverdev.com/get-involved"" target=""_blank"">here</A>.</P><H4>2. Power your home with renewable energy.</H4><P>Choose a utility company that generates at least half its power from wind or solar and has been certified by <A href=""http://www.green-e.org/gogreene.shtml"">Green-e Energy</A>, an organization that vets renewable energy options. If that isn’t possible for you, take a look at your electric bill; many utilities now list other ways to support renewable sources on their monthly statements and websites.</P><H4>3. Weatherize, weatherize, weatherize.</H4><P>“Building heating and cooling are among the biggest uses of energy,” Haq says. Indeed, heating and air-conditioning account for almost half of home energy use. You can make your space more energy efficient by sealing drafts and ensuring it’s adequately insulated. You can also claim <A href=""http://energytaxincentives.org/"">federal tax credits</A> for many energy-efficiency home improvements.</P><H4>4. Invest in energy-efficient appliances.</H4><P>Since they were first implemented nationally in 1987, efficiency standards for dozens of appliances and products have kept 2.3 billion tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide out of the air. That’s about the same amount as the annual <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> coughed up by nearly 440 million cars. “Energy efficiency is the lowest-cost way to reduce emissions,” Haq says. When shopping for refrigerators, washing machines, and other appliances, look for the <A href=""http://www.energystar.gov/"">Energy Star</A> label. It will tell you which are the most efficient.</P><H4>5. Reduce water waste.</H4><P>Saving water reduces <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>, too. That's because it takes a lot of energy to pump, heat, and treat your water. So take shorter showers, turn off the tap while brushing your teeth, and switch to <A href=""https://www.epa.gov/watersense"">WaterSense</A>-labeled fixtures and appliances. The EPA estimates that if just one out of every 100 American homes were retrofitted with water-efficient fixtures, about 100 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year would be saved—avoiding <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/energywater.pdf"">80,000 tons of global warming <mark>pollution</mark></A>.</P><H4>6. Actually eat the food you buy—and make less of it meat.</H4><P>Approximately 10 percent of U.S. energy use goes into growing, processing, packaging, and shipping food—about 40 percent of which just winds up in the landfill. “If you’re wasting less food, you’re likely cutting down on energy consumption,” Haq says. And since livestock products are among the most resource-intensive to produce, eating meat-free meals can make a big difference, too.</P><H4>7. Buy better bulbs.</H4><P>LED lightbulbs use up to 80 percent less energy than conventional incandescents. They’re also cheaper in the long run: A 10-watt LED that replaces your traditional 60-watt bulb will save you $125 over the lightbulb’s life.</P><H4>8. Pull the plug(s).</H4><P>Taken together, the outlets in your home are likely powering about 65 different devices – an average load for a home in the U.S. Audio and video devices, cordless vacuums and power tools, and other electronics use energy even when they're not charging. This &quot;idle load&quot; across all U.S. households adds up to the output of <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/home-idle-load-IP.pdf"">50 large power plants in the U.S.</A> So don't leave fully charged devices plugged into your home's outlets, unplug rarely used devices or plug them into power strips and timers, and adjust your computers and monitors to automatically power down to the lowest power mode when not in use.</P><H4>9. Drive a fuel-efficient vehicle.</H4><P>Gas-smart cars, such as hybrids and fully electric vehicles, save fuel and money. And once all cars and light trucks meet 2025’s clean car standards, which means averaging 54.5 miles per gallon, they’ll be a mainstay. For good reason: Relative to a national fleet of vehicles that averaged only 28.3 miles per gallon in 2011, Americans will spend $80 billion less at the pump each year and cut their automotive emissions by half. Before you buy a new set of wheels, compare fuel-economy performance <A href=""http://www.fueleconomy.gov/"">here</A>.</P><H4>10. Maintain your ride.</H4><P>If all Americans kept their tires properly inflated, we could save 1.2 billion gallons of gas each year. A simple tune-up can boost miles per gallon anywhere from 4 percent to 40 percent, and a new air filter can get you a 10 percent boost.</P><H4>11. Rethink planes, trains, and automobiles.</H4><P>Choosing to live in walkable <A href=""/stories/here-comes-sun"" target=""_blank"">smart-growth</A> cities and towns with quality public transportation leads to less driving, less money spent on fuel, and less <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/<mark>climate</mark>-change-and-health-air-quality""><mark>pollution</mark> in the air</A>. Less frequent flying can make a big difference, too. “Air transport is a major source of <mark>climate</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>,” Haq says. “If you can take a train instead, do that.”</P><H4>12. Shrink your <mark>carbon</mark> profile.</H4><P>You can offset the <mark>carbon</mark> you produce by purchasing <mark>carbon</mark> offsets, which represent clean power that you can add to the nation’s energy grid in place of power from fossil fuels. But not all <mark>carbon</mark> offset companies are alike. <A href=""/stories/should-you-buy-<mark>carbon</mark>-offsets"" target=""_blank"">Do your homework</A> to find the best supplier.</P><DIV class=""action-promo-wrap""><DIV class=""l-1up-promo clearfix""><DIV class=""oneup-promo-text-wrap eq-col""><DIV class=""oneup-promo-text""><H2>Tell Trump we won't stop fighting global <mark>climate change</mark></H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SPAN></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Sonia Lupien, full professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Université de Montréal and director of the Centre for Studies on Human Stress, assumed so for a long time—that is, until she began to explore stress in women and saw the astonishing results. “Twenty years ago, I studied only male subjects, who are more hormonally stable,” explains Lupien. “My colleagues and I were convinced that our observations also applied to women.” But in early 2000, citing ethical grounds, funding agencies began to require that researchers include women in their projects. “I really hoped that I wouldn’t find any difference between stress in women and men so I wouldn’t have to deal with female hormones,” she admits. The psychoneuroendocrinologist’s early findings showed that women were less physiologically reactive to stress than men but had much higher basal stress levels. “Basal stress is the stress you carry with you. After an argument with a spouse, for example,” says Lupien. “Women are constantly producing more stress hormones because they see stressors everywhere. They also tend to define themselves by the stress they experience.”</P><P><STRONG>Gendered stress?</STRONG></P><P>Lupien took the project one step further by studying whether gender, like sexual orientation or social roles, could also influence stress. With PhD student Robert-Paul Juster, she surveyed the interactions between sex, gender and stress in workers. The results showed that male and female employees who took on roles that were considered masculine (e.g. assertiveness, competiveness) had higher levels of stress hormones. Sexual orientation also impacts stress: the stress patterns of gay men are similar to those of heterosexual women and those of lesbians are comparable to straight men’s. Finally, coming out is beneficial to an individual’s mental health since it reduces stress hormones and curbs the symptoms of anxiety, depression and burnout.</P><P>Today, psychologists rely on these observations to guide their therapies. For Sonia Lupien, who was voted among the Top 10 Canadians Who Make a Difference by<EM> MacLean’s</EM> magazine in 2003, transferring knowledge to professionals and the general public is of utmost importance: “I got up one morning and decided to share my results on a <A href=""http://www.sonialupien.com"" class=""external external_icon"" rel=""nofollow"">website</A> to which my students contribute on a voluntary basis.” There, she discusses the various aspects of stress, including the stress associated with career choice among grade 11 students. “Teenagers have to stop stressing about what they want to do. Above all, their choices should be guided by their passions, and then life will direct them toward a career that will merge their talents and passions,” affirms Lupien. Indeed, she only discovered her passion for stress research and academia in the second year of her PhD in neuroscience.</P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Because some additional warming is inevitable—even if we achieve significant greenhouse gas reductions quickly—we should make plans to adapt to coming <mark>climate change</mark>. If we are unable to control emissions and/or adapt to unavoidable changes quickly enough, a carefully selected geoengineering strategy could conceivably provide an emergency stopgap to slow global warming. As yet, however, several of the strategies being discussed are very risky and unproven.</P><P><STRONG>Controlling Emissions</STRONG>
Controlling emissions is a large, complex, and potentially expensive problem that no single strategy will solve. On the other hand, the costs of uncontrolled global warming will probably also be significant. Many economists have concluded that putting existing scientific and technological strategies into place and developing new ones may stimulate the economy, and would also generate significant near-term benefits in public health through air <mark>pollution</mark> reduction.</P><P>The <A href=""http://cmi.princeton.edu/wedges/intro.php""><mark>Carbon</mark> Mitigation Initiative,</A> a university and industry partnership based at Princeton University, has identified strategies—based solely on existing technologies—that used in combination over the next 50 years, would keep the amount of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere from more than doubling the pre-industrial level. (Many scientists believe doubled <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels will cause a dangerous interference with the <mark>climate</mark>.) These strategies are:</P><OL style=""padding-bottom: 16px;""><LI style=""margin-left: 15px;"">Increase the energy efficiency of our cars, homes, and power plants while lowering our consumption by adjusting our thermostats and traveling fewer miles;</LI><LI style=""margin-left: 15px;"">Capture the <mark>carbon</mark> emitted by power plants and store it underground;</LI><LI style=""margin-left: 15px;"">Produce more energy from nuclear, natural gas, and renewable fuels—solar, wind, hydroelectric, and bio-fuels;</LI><LI style=""margin-left: 15px;"">Halt deforestation and soil degradation worldwide, while reforesting more areas.</LI></OL><P>Some of those strategies will have to be put into place by governments and industry, but individuals can also do a lot on their own. On average, individual Americans emit 19 tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide annually while driving our cars and heating our homes—more than people in any other country. If we can reduce our personal emissions by just 5 percent, total U.S. emissions would drop by 300 million tons. That reduction could be easily achieved by replacing appliances and light bulbs with more efficient ones, planning our automobile trips more carefully, driving more fuel-efficient cars, taking fewer flights, and so on.</P><P>By learning about global warming, by communicating with elected officials about the problem, and by making energy-conscious decisions, individuals will play a meaningful role in what must be a global effort to respond to global warming.</P><P><STRONG>Adapting to <mark>Climate Change</mark></STRONG><mark>Climate</mark> has been fluctuating throughout Earth’s history, and recently, humans have become one of the factors contributing to <mark>climate change</mark>. Changes related to human activity are already being felt. Even if we were to stop greenhouse gas emissions today, additional <mark>climate change</mark> from emissions already in the atmosphere would be inevitable. For this reason, many governments and industries are beginning to adapt policies, disaster response plans, or infrastructure to prepare for anticipated changes. While some adaptations are difficult and expensive, many are relatively inexpensive and offer immediate benefits.</P><P>Adaptation strategies vary from region to region, depending on the greatest threat posed by <mark>climate change</mark> locally. For example, coastal regions facing rising sea levels and increased coastal erosion might eliminate incentives to develop high-risk coastlines and encourage a “living buffer” of sand dunes and forest between the ocean and infrastructure. New York City has already integrated <mark>climate change</mark> into the process it uses to plan future development, reducing the need for expensive retrofitting later.</P><P>Local governments may adjust disaster response plans to accommodate changes in weather patterns. The city of Philadelphia recently implemented an emergency response plan to limit the health impact of increasingly frequent heat waves on its population. Philadelphia officials estimate that their heat response plan has already reduced heat-related deaths.</P><P>More extreme and expensive adaptations may become necessary in some regions. Thawing permafrost and increased storms, windiness and coastal erosion are now putting at least 166 communities at risk in Alaska. Moving each community to safer areas will cost an estimated 30 to 50 million dollars per village, estimates the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Six communities have already decided to relocate.</P><P>For individuals, governments, and businesses, adapting to <mark>climate change</mark> requires understanding and accepting the risks of regional <mark>climate change</mark>, assessing the immediate and long-term costs and benefits of adaptation strategies, and implementing adaptations that bring the most benefits relative to the cost and risk.</P><P><STRONG>Geoengineering</STRONG>Though risky and unproven, geoengineering could provide another near-term strategy for slowing global warming until <mark>carbon</mark> emissions can be reduced enough to prevent catastrophic <mark>climate change</mark>. In this context, geoengineering means deliberately altering the atmosphere, land, or ocean to counter the effects of global warming.</P><P>Many geoengineering schemes have been proposed, but all can be reduced to two main strategies: reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (increase the amount of infrared radiation escaping to space) or reduce the amount of solar energy the Earth system absorbs. Two of the most common examples of these geoengineering strategies involve removing <mark>carbon</mark> from the atmosphere by adding fertilizer to selected regions of the ocean to increase phytoplankton growth and reflecting more sunlight by injecting tiny, non-absorbing particles (aerosols) into the upper atmosphere (stratosphere).</P><P>While both of these geoengineering examples might counter global warming for a time, they could also have significant drawbacks. Increased fertilizers and/or phytoplankton growth could have unintended consequences on ocean ecosystems, including increased ocean dead zones and toxic blooms. Adding aerosols to the upper atmosphere could modify the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, affecting ozone and thereby having possible unintended impacts on the lower atmosphere.</P><P>Because the impact of geoengineering on the complex global <mark>climate</mark> system hasn’t been extensively studied, any large-scale geoengineering strategy could have serious unexpected consequences. As a result, most scientists consider geoengineering only as a last-resort, emergency measure.</P><OL class=""references""><LI><H4>References</H4></LI><LI>America’s <mark>Climate</mark> Choices.

Scientists have concluded that, over the last 50 years, the Earth’s surface should have been cooling slightly based on natural factors, like solar intensity and volcano activity; instead, the increased burning of fossil fuels has led to global warming—and at a significantly faster rate than at any time over the last 800,000 years.</P><P>People around the world are already feeling the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on the environment. A hotter atmosphere means extreme weather is more likely and potentially more devastating: droughts, flooding, and more severe storms have all become more common. Changing weather patterns can ruin crops and cause serious water shortages. Rising sea levels are threatening low-lying islands and coastal cities. Tropical and insect-borne diseases are spreading as their hosts colonize new habitats that were previously too cold for them to survive.</P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> represents a significant threat to the health and well-being of human societies, especially in vulnerable areas of the developing world where people are ill-equipped to deal with the side effects of a warmer <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P> </P></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

	The Internet is full of references to global warming. But we don't use the term “global warming” much here at <mark>Climate</mark> Reality. Instead, we prefer to use &quot;<mark>climate change</mark>.&quot;
</P><P><EM>Why? </EM></P><P>
	Global warming and <mark>climate change</mark> – while closely related and sometimes used interchangeably – technically refer to two different things:
</P><UL><LI><STRONG>“Global warming”</STRONG> applies to the long-term trend of rising average global temperatures.
	</LI><LI><STRONG>“<mark>Climate change</mark>”</STRONG> is a broader term that reflects the fact that <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> does more than just warm our planet. <mark>Carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> is also changing rain and snow patterns and increasing the risk of intense storms and droughts.   
	</LI></UL><H3><STRONG>So what’s the difference?</STRONG></H3><P>
	To a scientist, global warming describes the rise in average surface temperatures we see resulting from human emissions of greenhouse gases.
</P><P>
	Although “global warming” seems to have first appeared in a 1957 newspaper editorial, the term is widely attributed to Wallace Broecker’s 1975 paper “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?”
</P><P>
	Broecker's term was a break with tradition. Earlier studies of human impact on <mark>climate</mark> had called it &quot;inadvertent <mark>climate</mark> modification.&quot; This was because while many scientists accepted that human activities could cause <mark>climate change</mark>, they did not know what the direction of change might be. Industrial emissions of tiny airborne particles called aerosols might cause cooling, while greenhouse gas emissions would cause warming. And in the middle of the twentieth century, scientists wondered which effect would dominate.
</P><P>
	Through most of the 1970s, few were certain. So &quot;inadvertent <mark>climate</mark> modification,&quot; while clunky and dull, was an accurate reflection of what we knew.
</P><P>
	The first decisive <A href=""http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12181"" target=""_blank"">National Academy of Science study</A> of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide's impact on <mark>climate</mark>, published in 1979, abandoned &quot;inadvertent <mark>climate</mark> modification.&quot; Often called the Charney Report for its chairman, Jule Charney of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, it declared: &quot;If <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide continues to increase<STRONG>, [we find] no reason to doubt that <mark>climate change</mark>s will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible</STRONG>.&quot;
</P><P>
	In place of “inadvertent <mark>climate</mark> modification,” Charney adopted Broecker's language. When referring to surface temperature change, Charney spoke of &quot;global warming.&quot; When discussing the many other changes that would be induced by increasing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, Charney called them what they were: &quot;<mark>climate change</mark>.&quot;
</P><H3><STRONG>“Global Warming” Enters the Popular Lexicon</STRONG> </H3><P>
	During the late 1980s, one more term entered the lexicon: “global change.” This term encompassed <EM>many other kinds of change</EM> in addition to <mark>climate change</mark>. Reflecting the understanding that <mark>climate change</mark> could be part of an even larger picture, when the US Global Change Research Program was approved in 1989, <mark>climate</mark> research was a key theme area. </P><P>
	“Global warming” became the dominant popular term in June 1988, when NASA scientist James E.

So <STRONG>&quot;global <mark>climate change</mark>&quot; is the more all-inclusive and scientifically accurate term</STRONG>. Like the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> – the UN’s body for assessing <mark>climate</mark> science – we've chosen to emphasize global <mark>climate change</mark>, and not global warming.
</P><H3><STRONG>Here’s What You Need To Remember</STRONG></H3><P>
	Don’t fall prey to the idea that the increased popular usage of “<mark>climate change</mark>” means global warming is no longer happening. <STRONG>Both <mark>climate change</mark> and global warming are still a reality.</STRONG></P><P>
	Whether referred to as &quot;global warming&quot; or &quot;<mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; the consequences of the enormous changes currently being observed in Earth's <mark>climate</mark> system are undeniable. That’s why we need our leaders to listen to the science and accept reality – instead of splitting hairs over terminology.

This material has forced the Keatsian scholarship to re-examine the Keats-Severn controversy, propelled by many to the higher sphere of undying love and Christian self-sacrifice, as well as dig deeper into Keats’s unlikely ‘posthumous existence’<SUP><A class=""footnotecall"" id=""bodyftn1"" href=""#ftn1"">1</A></SUP> – as he himself called it – of two artists brought together by the necessities of money, personal interest and tuberculosis. A common path(ology) which has somewhat survived the test of time: from the shared cabin on board the <EM>Maria Crowther</EM> to the twin tombs and epitaphs in the Rome Protestant Cemetery. Such a literary perspective, in the form of a tale or a myth, from the ship to the grave, is symptomatic of the growing interest, amongst Romantic scholars, for this somewhat dysfunctional relationship, at times ignored (as if Severn had been, in his twenties, buried alive along with Keats) at times over-idealised: ‘It is perhaps the most dramatic foreshortening of any life in literary history (Scott 2005: 1)’. Food for thought or rather food for naught and yet the substance of a large Victorian heritage, forever in love with this sentimental journey south of two ‘poet-painters’ (Oscar Wilde) whose fates rely on an interwoven tapestry of Names; one of which will, of course, be John Ruskin. Only to his brother and under the seal of family secrecy can Severn trust the privacy of confession to admit the truth – the ugly truth: ‘I have gained more from poor Keats who is dead and gone than from any other source’ (Scott 2005: 269). Severn here unmasked: the statement bears his own signature. Circumstances also seem to partially clear his name. At William Haslam’s requests and John Taylor’s, Keats’s editor, we know that Severn had been but a poor substitute for Charles Brown, being urged to take the best friend’s place at the last minute. In the end, there was just simply no one else who was willing to go. The attraction and privilege of an apparent ‘devotion’<SUP><A class=""footnotecall"" id=""bodyftn2"" href=""#ftn2"">2</A></SUP> to the ‘great’ but ‘poor’ poet was the right to leave England and the restricted circles of the Royal Academy for the promise of a more fashionable exile and its range of Italian influences. However, the flaw Severn displayed when he sought to expand rapidly and sometimes with poor judgement his artistic community was failing to discriminate between some of his more frivolous encounters with lords and countesses and such stronger bonds as the one he helped establish between the two Johns: the Romantic poet, Keats, and the Victorian critic, Ruskin. Contrary to Severn’s own emancipation from the quarantine of the ‘Cockney poet’ in Naples into the healthier ranks of nobility in Rome, William Sharp, Severn’s first biographer, despite a certain carelessness in providing his readership with reliable facts and resources, gives nonetheless a more objective version of how the painter was in many ways rewarded for his attachment to the poet. He finally insists on how such an affiliation allowed the Severn circle to extend itself beyond social and temporal limitations:</P><DIV class=""citation""><P class=""citation"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">The unexpected reward which his devotion to Keats had won him was not long delayed in the coming, and it is pleasant to know that, as one instance, so good a judge of art and literature as Mr. Erskine of Linlathen first took an interest in the young artist, and commissioned a picture from him, on account of his connection with the poet, whose early death was even then regarded by not a few as a disastrous loss to English literature. Later on, he won the friendshipof Mr. Ruskin, Mr. Gladstone, and other eminent men, primarily on the same account. ‘You would be surprised’, he writes, ‘how often I am pointed out here as the friend of Keats (Sharp 1892: 147-48).</P></DIV><P class=""texte"" lang=""en-GB"" dir=""ltr"">The last quote mentioned by Sharp is an excerpt from one of the most famous of Severn’s family letters written from l’Accricia near Rome, on 4 October 1824, to his sister Maria, in which the painter admits that his partnership with Keats has provided him with a considerable success on the Italian pictorial scene. In addition, Severn reveals that, instead of building his life and art in the shadow of Keats’s name, he has planned his artistic career in collaboration with Keats’s fame. Finally, Severn views his indebtedness to the poet, not as a belittling crutch but rather as a rewarding source of pride:</P><DIV class=""citation""><P class=""ww-citation"" lang=""en-GB"" dir=""ltr"">Owing to this Lady’s death I have added a number of great and serviceable friends to my future life - is it not singular that to my acqua[i]ntance (sic) - and then gave me this order for the ‘Lear’ - my coming with Keats and friendship for him - will be a never fading Laurel, for everyone knows it, as Keats’s name is rising, and everyone respects my character for it. - You would be surprised, how often it is mentioned to me - and how I am pointed out as the friend of the Poet Keats. - It was the work of Providence for my good both in mind and fortune. - I can never cease to remember it, and be thankful to God - for turning to good what I began so carelessly. - it was a risk indeed (Scott 2005: 262).</P></DIV><P class=""texte"" lang=""en-GB"" dir=""ltr"">As time passed, Severn’s allusions to the significance of this complex partnership with Keats grew in length and number as the painter was looking for a stronger motive to justify his trip to Italy, turning the whole experience into a positive adventure, whatever the setbacks, for the sake of family purposes and peace of mind:</P><DIV class=""citation""><P class=""ww-citation"" lang=""en-GB"" dir=""ltr"">I hope still to have the happiness to see my poor dear Mother, and should now be on my way but for the losses I have had, yet still if something turns up I shall set off to England for I long to come and see you all it will be 17 years in October since you &amp; I sailed down the Thames with poor Keats, I see you now in my mind’s eye, and the blue coat you had on, I can never forget you - how pale you look’d at the scene we had passed and how I trembled - yet all this was for the best, for I could not expect to have done what I have done here, or certainly made so many friends who are capable of serving my family (Scott 2005: 340)</P></DIV><P class=""texte"" lang=""en-GB"" dir=""ltr"">Keats therefore became the centre of the Severn family’s main preoccupations as did his daily state of mind and the status of his bad health in exchange for Severn’s ever increasing role in what Lord Brock called the poet’s ‘tragedy of the last illness’. A new poet-painter brotherhood (a first glimpse into the Pre-Raphaelite heritage surely) which, despite the unhappy circumstances, was to bear more than one fruit, resulting in the marriage of one family of artists to another: Severn’s son, Arthur, with Ruskin’s Scottish cousin and ward, Miss Joan Ruskin Agnew. This proud union, Severn announced once again in one of his numerous letters to his sister Maria, on 7 December 1870, while he was still British consulate, in Rome: ‘You’ll be surprised to hear that the sixth marriage in my dear family is soon to take place – Arthur is to be married to Miss Joan Agnew who has a house &amp; garden on Denmark Hill’ (Scott 2005: 529). Severn’s own merit relies indeed upon his own ambition and his stubbornness in refusing to share with others some of his closer relations, somewhat selfishly perhaps but convinced, in the long run, that keeping his circle intact would result in a fortunate outcome for everyone.</P><DIV class=""section1""><A href=""#tocfrom2"" id=""tocto2"">2. Sons and Daughters: Severn, Ruskin and the Family Name</A></DIV><P class=""texte"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">John Ruskin, impressed by the scope of Severn’s influential circle, draws, in his <EM>Praeterita</EM>, an incredibly vivid portrait of the ‘lovingly humorous’ painter, after having first come upon him and George Richmond, at Severn’s house in Via Rasella, when he visited Rome for the first time in 1840:</P><DIV class=""citation""><P class=""citation"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">But there is nothing in any circle that never I saw or heard of, like Mr. Joseph Severn then was in Rome. He understood everybody, native and foreign, civil and ecclesiastic, in what was nicest in them, and never saw anything else than the nicest; or saw what other people got angry about as only a humorous part of the nature of things. (....) Lightly sagacious, lovingly humorous, daintily sentimental, he was in council with the cardinals to-day, and at picnic in Campagna with the brightest English belles to-morrow; and caught the hearts of all in the golden net of his good will and good understanding, as if life were but for him the rippling chant of his favourite song,- ‘Gente, e qui l’uccellatore’ (II, 249).</P></DIV><P class=""texte"" lang=""en-GB"" dir=""ltr"">A few decades later, Ruskin’s protégée was to marry Severn’s son and become part of the father-painter’s enlarged family, here associated to the memory of Keats as well as to the changes that occurred throughout the years on the Italian scene:</P><DIV class=""citation""><P class=""citation"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">So you want to know what Joan said about her visit to you &amp; here it is ‘Arthur and I went on Monday last to see your Sister (our Aunt Maria) &amp; found her very well. I thought her such a sweet old Lady &amp; very handsome. I hope to be able to go &amp; see her pretty often’— There now I think you’ll be well pleased with my daughter Joan (...) The selling of my picture of Keats Grave has been a great feather in my cap – I am glad to hear that poor dear Tom is able to go up &amp; down the stairs, and that you showd (sic) off in a new gown for Joan’s visit &amp; that have summer days—What you say about the <mark>climate</mark> changing is certainly true. Easter is no longer very fine at Rome but has always a touch of winter &amp; I think your Easter is now better than when we remember it as children.<SUP><A class=""footnotecall"" id=""bodyftn3"" href=""#ftn3"">3</A></SUP></P></DIV><P class=""texte"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">In the same way Grant Scott drew our scholarly attention on the added value of Severn’s private letters and the knowledge we might gain from their publication, Rachel Dickinson has done very much the same in her edition of Joan Severn’s ‘sense and nonsense letters’ to John Ruskin. The name of Severn comes up once again in the most recent compilations of epistolary scholarship on Ruskin. No surprise there. In the same way that the last letter we quoted could very well come right out of a Jane Austen novel or be included in Rachel Dickinson’s sensible research, there are valuable details on Severn’s patriarchy and patronage as well as on Ruskin’s opinions on the ideal arts, on travel or on education hidden behind the apparent nonsense of (fe)male affectation. The letters, although unsubstantial at times, work as a substitute for the critic’s personal diary. Similarly, Arthur Severn’s recollections of his father-in-law show insight into the realm of the writer’s personal confessions and ‘prove extremely interesting, considering the author’s intimate association with Ruskin and his great talent as a raconteur’.<SUP><A class=""footnotecall"" id=""bodyftn4"" href=""#ftn4"">4</A></SUP> This talent Arthur surely inherited from his father whose company and stories several of the century’s greatest minds never ceased to enjoy. If the letter to his brother Thomas Severn, written in Rome and dated 10 June 1872, recalls a visit from Arthur and Joan at John Ruskin’s request in ‘the north of Italy’, it also mentions the homage paid to a noble line of painters and story-tellers; a Ruskin-Severn collaborative piece of memorabilia celebrated in the form of a picture by Joseph Severn of Joan (Agnew Ruskin) Severn, ‘the charming Bride’:</P><DIV class=""citation""><P class=""citation"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">Lately, I have had the delight of a visit from my Arthur &amp; his Bride with Mr. J Ruskin, Mrs Hilliard &amp; her daughter &amp; Mr Godwin. This was indeed a treat &amp; no doubt my desire to return was partly caused by the charming Bride offering me an asylum in her house at Herne Hill fearing that I might have been left pennyless. In the recent visit she showed me great affection &amp; I was able to draw her picture &amp; produce one of my best works – This journey is an invite of Mr. John Ruskins, but I fear at this moment they may be hampered with the rain &amp; inundations in the north of Italy – my Arthur is pursuing his painting tho’ not quite brilliantly as at first, he has now the misfortune of a little independence which may impede his working.<SUP><A class=""footnotecall"" id=""bodyftn5"" href=""#ftn5"">5</A></SUP></P></DIV><P class=""texte"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">When the older generation painted and immortalised the next, the younger heirs were always eager to preserve the cultural authority of their elders. Needless to say that both Severn and Ruskin owe a great deal of their posthumous glow to the care of a grateful couple, named guardians of the artists’ secrets and revelations. They felt entitled to keep their titles, so to speak, the ones they claimed to have rightly inherited. Beyond the closed circle of friends and family, such claims opened a new pathway into a larger political landscape and ‘economy of art’ (Ruskin 2008: 101-02). Inscribing the name of the poet as a <EM>trompe-l’œil</EM> instead of a genuine epigraph would then make for a powerful statement on the aesthetics of writing, the value of art and the birth of modern criticism: Ruskin’s response, however deceitful, to Keats’s own ‘(pathetic) fallacies’.<SUP><A class=""footnotecall"" id=""bodyftn6"" href=""#ftn6"">6</A></SUP> In the end, Arthur and Joan survived, whatever the cost, forever indebted and perhaps slightly burdened by two, dare we say three, famous last names: Severn, Ruskin and Keats.</P><DIV class=""section1""><A href=""#tocfrom3"" id=""tocto3"">3. ‘A Joy for Ever’: Ruskin and the Keats Legacy</A></DIV><P class=""texte"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">If Ruskin was in awe of Joseph Severn’s efficiency in equally pleasing all the members of his Anglo-Italian coterie, he was certainly most thankful, as were many others at that time – Shelley, to name just one – to have brought Keats to Italy. Keats, the Londoner; Keats, the Hampstead poet: the only Romantic who had never travelled abroad before or even expressed the desire to leave England. Yet Keats, by way of fantasy and exoticism, had dreamt of Italy as a heavenly place of culture – a place he came to discover, or uncover rather, with glimpses of disappointment, blinded as he was by his affliction and the remnants of his pathology. Because he never made it to Venice, he kept of the city ‘whose Name was [literally] writ in water’ a better image than the one he drew out of a gloomy Rome. In addition to the time he spent with Severn, this is also something he shared with Ruskin, aside from the many labels that were forced onto his Italian heritage. Venice is here approached from another angle, the symbol of its inherent richness in terms of nature and perspective: the roots of an artistic rapprochement, beyond the imperatives of history or chronology. Keats and Ruskin: a ‘Romantic Victorian’ pair with a common friend, a reliable circle, connections leading to a similar understanding of art and criticism. If Byron and Shelley belonged to a larger group of British poets and painters who did indeed travel to this unique spot (in time) – ‘Lord Byron, we hear, has taken a house for three years, at Venice; whether we shall see him or not, I do not know. The number of English who pass through this town is very great’<SUP><A class=""footnotecall"" id=""bodyftn7"" href=""#ftn7"">7</A></SUP> – Keats, on the other hand, would have to be content with just picturing its beauties from afar and invent his own Gothic revival with no real image in mind, all the while lacking in what the Romantics would promote as cultural experience. By reconstructing, in the unfinished <EM>Eve of St. Mark</EM>, a Venitian sanctuary for his heroin, whose discovery marks the climax of this holy fragment, Keats seems to be wandering off with her, away from dark thoughts but his mind restructured by a Book of legends and pious poetry. This ceremonial, more than simply honouring the power of evocation amongst the ruins, gives the poet a chance to revel in architectural delight by piecing back together some of his original Italian models. The poet trusts his fancy to do all the work, he who had ventured no further than the shores of his native country. The poem is not just written but carved in stone with monumental words – the first labelled reference or reverence to the ‘stones of Venice’<SUP><A class=""footnotecall"" id=""bodyftn8"" href=""#ftn8"">8</A></SUP> which would later become so dear to Ruskin:</P><DIV class=""citation""><P class=""citation"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">           Untir’d she read the legend page</P></DIV><DIV class=""citation""><P class=""citation"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">         Of holy Mark from youth to age;</P></DIV><DIV class=""citation""><P class=""citation"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">         On land, on seas, in pagan-chains,</P></DIV><DIV class=""citation""><P class=""citation"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">            Rejoicing for his many pains.</P></DIV><DIV class=""citation""><P class=""citation"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">    [...]</P></DIV><DIV class=""citation""><P class=""citation"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">            At length her constant eyelids come</P></DIV><DIV class=""citation""><P class=""citation"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">            Upon the fervent martyrdom;</P></DIV><DIV class=""citation""><P class=""citation"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">            Then lastly to his holy shrine,</P></DIV><DIV class=""citation""><P class=""citation"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">            Exalt amid the tapers’ shine</P></DIV><DIV class=""citation""><P class=""citation"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">            At Venice (v.89-92 &amp;115-19) (Stillinger 1978: 242)</P></DIV><P class=""texte"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">The Saint-Agnes scenery, the stage of Keats’s other celebrated Eve, is also tinged with Venitian splendor, fantasized to the point of beatification. The visual prowess, the mysticism, the profuse sense of detail and subtext in Vittore Carpaccio’s works would become the center of everyone’s attention, Keats, Ruskin, Burne-Jones, all equally enraptured by a feeling of distant familiarity; Carpaccio’s <EM>Legend of Saint Ursula</EM> (1490), more particularly, fascinated Ruskin, when he visited Venice in 1869, ‘after having had his attention drawn to the artist by Burne-Jones’: ‘There she lies, so real, that when the room’s quite quiet, I get afraid of waking her’ (he writes to Joan Severn, Venice, 19 September 1876, before painting his own <EM>Copy of the Head of St. Ursula from Carpaccio’s </EM>The Dream of St. Ursula, 1877) (Hewison/ Warrell/Wildman 2000: 264)’. Struck by the rediscovery of these works, the substance of which will inspire his later theories on modern art, Ruskin will bring to what can only be labeled as tradition a sense of novelty and euphoria, thus conceived by the Pre-Raphaelites as an artistic revival. Keats himself shaped his own version of an English Romantic art on the basis of an open heritage where Venice, forever unvisited, is not as such a place of memory but a place where the imagination can easily flourish and thus be memorialized: a memorial of the unknown, the inheritance of which cannot be grasped or claimed but certainly invented. Keats, long before Shelley, clearly stands out as the premature voice and posthumous embodiment of those visual influences, whether they were extracted from the world of architecture or from the spectre of Italian paintings. Although a stranger to Italy’s most famous landmarks, Keats mapped his own geography of transition, he who understood very early on that no truth is worth writing except in the name of art’s essential mutability. Between his <EM>Eve of St. Agnes</EM> and Millais’s version of it, or between Carpaccio’s and Burne-Jones’s pictures, Keats, protected by Severn and then honored by Ruskin will give rise to both the Italianate charm of Shelley’s <EM>Adonais </EM>as well as the chain of words and images which held the Pre-Raphaelite School together. The virtue, maybe even the glory, of the Keatsian aesthetics (in which Ruskin found great material to work on) is to have overcome the obstacles of distance and inexperience by promoting an attachment to some of the long-lasting values and universal labels of art. Keats, like Kant, a genius eager to transcend place and origin by versifying on something he never really saw or as such experienced. The result is the solid durability of his poetry writing, valuable in that there is no end as to how much of its substance can be recycled by others. From Victorian labeling, always keen to advertise a weaker, Ophelia-like Keats with effeminate lines of conduct feeding on sexual madness as a genre, to a diluted sense of modernity like Ruskin’s, the writers (or painters), whatever their choice of label, have found plenty of hidden and altered sources to imitate in Keats’s poems. The hand of Ruskin extends to other dignified heirs: Francis Scott Fitzgerald in <EM>Tender is the Night</EM>, Virginia Woolf in <EM>Mrs. Dalloway</EM>, Tony Harrison in his ‘Kumquat for John Keats’, Willem De Kooning and his own abstract version of an epitaphic homage in the painting entitled <EM>…Whose Name was Writ in Water</EM>, Dan Simmons’s Keats cybrid in his science-fiction trilogy, Gérard Genette even, in <EM>Palimpsestes</EM>, translating Keats’s verse, in the space of a footnote…<SUP><A class=""footnotecall"" id=""bodyftn9"" href=""#ftn9"">9</A></SUP> Keats thus reborn as a concept: fictional, linguistic, expressionist, industrial, mechanic. Caught up in the endless cycles/circles of Keatsian brotherhoods (from one affiliation to the next), such tributes in the forms of palimpsests, whether displaced, deconstructed or mislabeled, have always been at the heart of post-Romantic investigation and speculation. Other references seemed to be more easily identifiable in the works of contemporaries and successors, much more versed, and yet not always so convincingly, in the different modes of portraiture, posthumous representation and cultural travel. The source of endless questions, some still unanswered. Was John Keats really ‘killed off by one critique’ or ‘snuffed out by an Article (XI, 60) (Steffan, Steffan &amp; Pratt 1973: 412)’? What became of the engagement with Fanny Brawne? Was he really buried with some of her letters? Why does the mystery of the sick poet or of the young dead icon continue to live on? In this context, Keats, still the subject today of renewed, popular interest (in light of Jane Campion’s most recent homage in <EM>Bright Star</EM>), whatever the outrageous label attached to the poet’s name, is certainly unique.</P><DIV class=""section2""><A href=""#tocfrom5"" id=""tocto5"">Primary Sources</A></DIV><P class=""texte"" lang=""fr-FR"" dir=""ltr"">Dickinson, Rachel, ed.

For instance, Keats, describing a wave breaking out at sea, says of it—‘Down whose green back the short-lived foam, all hoar,/Bursts gradual, with a wayward indolence (<EM>Endymion</EM>, II, 350)’. That is quite perfect, as an example of the modern manner.

Some of the Pre-Raphaelites’ earliest and most important patrons lived in Oxford – above all Thomas Combe whose collection of paintings is now in the Ashmolean Museum. It was in the Oxford Union that their most important attempt at mural painting was made.

In today's modern society, the Internet has changed the way we live our lives. Whether it is the way we communicate at work, keep in touch with friends and family, or how we shop for goods and services, the online experience has enriched our lives. In 2009 a team of internet entrepreneurs decided that it was time to take the jewelry shopping experience to the next level by using the latest advancements in manufacturing and web technology to create a totally new way of buying and creating jewelry.</P><P>Our goal was to create an extraordinary online experience that gave shoppers the unique ability to create and visualize, in real time, rings, pendants, charms, and earrings, personalized to their exact requirements. Every style would be available in multiple metals, and every stone could be chosen from a wide selection of diamonds, birthstones, gemstones and Swarovksi Zirconia. Additionally, we would use laser engraving techniques to engrave names, messages, dates and other sentimental expressions to every item, to complete the personalized experience. Finally, the custom items would be manufactured in North America, in just a few days, and shipped directly to customers.</P><P>We recognized that to succeed we had to create unique designs, offer items that were value priced, have a no hassle return policy and we had to provide superb personalized customer support.</P><P>Since our humble beginnings we have grown to be one of the largest online Jeweler.

By teaching children how to properly moisturize, exfoliate, and protect their skin so young, they learn how important it is to be in control of their skin's health.​Taking care of your skin in the morning and in the evening, every single day, means the chance of unwanted blemishes erupting is lessened significantly, leaving your skin to shine. The earlier you realize this, the healthier your skin will be in the long-term.</P><H2 class=""intertitre"">Double Cleansing</H2><P class=""standard"">To ensure beautiful, flaw-free skin, you should spend time on the acclaimed two-step double cleansing method. The method aims to remove both makeup and excess dirt that is picked up throughout the day.</P><P class=""standard"">​The first step of the method is to apply an oil based cleanser to the face to remove any makeup and traces of oil. Next, you apply a foaming cleanser to remove dirt. This is because there are different types of dirt that can be removed with different types of cleansers. Like attracts like so use an oil based cleanser to attract and remove oils from your makeup and skin and a water based cleanser to remove water based impurities like sweat.</P><P class=""standard"">​This two-step cleansing approach guarantees smooth, radiant skin as well as unclogged pores.</P><P class=""standard"">&quot;Cleansing is the key to great skin. It’s a must, whether you have makeup on or not, because dirt and oil build up throughout the day&quot; says Yuna. &quot;Cleansing and exfoliating is necessary in order to wash away all impurities, unclog pores, and get smooth and refreshed skin.&quot;</P><P class=""standard""><A href=""http://sokoglam.com/products/skinfood-egg-white-pore-foam"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Skin Food Egg White Pore Foam</A> is a wonderful foam based cleanser to use to clean dirt without removing essential oils from your skin while <A href=""http://sokoglam.com/collections/banila-co/products/banila-co-clean-it-zero"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Clean It Zero</A> is Korea's no.1 cleansing balm that transforms into an oil on contact with skin. Use this together for pore perfection.</P><H2 class=""intertitre"">Hydration is Crucial</H2><P class=""standard"">Just like you, your skin is thirsty too. South Koreans aim to achieve a refreshed, hydrated face by using mists and moisturizers that are believed to prevent wrinkles. Loaded with hydrating ingredients, Korean Skincare products are amazing at revitalizing your skin.A great way to hydrate your skin is to use sheet masks soaked in <A href=""http://sokoglam.com/search?q=essence"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">essence.</A> Simply keep the sheet on your face for 20-30 minutes to ensure that the nutrients will be absorb into your skin. Another great way to hydrate your skin is to use a <A href=""http://sokoglam.com/collections/moisturize/products/lioele-v-line-sleeping-pack"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sleeping mask</A> at night.</P><P class=""standard"">Charlotte opts for sleeping masks rather than night creams. A sleeping mask &quot;creates a protective layer over your face, keeping all the active ingredients locked below the surface for better absorption while you sleep. When my face is excessively dry, I also like to use a facial mist throughout the day. It might sound like a lot but prevention is the best method to combat wrinkles!​&quot;<A href=""http://www.misshaus.com/ctrl.php?page=mainProductDetail&amp;p_code=MSMS2225&amp;ctg=BEA"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Try Near Skin Total Repairing Hydro Gel Mask</A> for a burst of hydration.

Just spritz your skin happy!</P><H2 class=""intertitre"">Don't Forget To Tone</H2><P class=""standard"">Toning is nothing out of the ordinary in the Western beauty hemisphere, however Asian beauty experts swear by this so-called 'magic in a bottle'.&quot;Toner, in general, is what sets your skin after cleansing so that the following products absorb well into the skin. Without a toner, my moisturizer just doesn’t go on the same,&quot; claims Yuna.You certainly don't want to skip over this step in your daily beauty routine. Toners replenish and nourish your skin while simultaneously shrinking the size of your pores. In Korea toners are referred to as 'refreshers' and that is exactly what they do. Refresh and ready the skin for the next step in your skincare routine.</P><P class=""standard"">Try best-seller <A href=""http://sokoglam.com/products/etude-house-moistfull-collagen-emulsion-moisturizer"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Etude House Collagen Moistfull Emulsion</A>.

And don't let their lightweight, water-like nature fool you- often that these liquid assets contain more benefits than your favorite creams or serums. Essences are typically used to target specific issues, which may range from acne to aging and any other skin condition in between.Each ingredient is designed to treat a specific skin concern. Essences have been big in Asia for years, so if you want to put a halt on the aging process and wake up looking like Vera Wang when you're 60, we suggest you invest!</P><P class=""standard""><A href=""http://sokoglam.com/collections/missha/products/time-revolution-first-treatment-essence"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Missha First Treatment Essence</A> helps to accelerate skin cell turnover to gradually reveal fresher, younger-looking skin.</P><H2 class=""intertitre"">Moisturize Daily</H2><P class=""standard"">If you want to put a stall on aging and keep your skin firm while maintaining a youthful glow, it is very important to moisturize each and every day. Moisturizers help increase your skin's water content and keep your skin feeling as soft as can be.</P><P class=""standard"">One particular ingredient that is common in Korean beauty products is is hyaluronic acid. &quot;It is a great humectant that binds moisture to the outer layer of skin&quot; says Charlotte.</P><P class=""standard""><A href=""http://kococolor.com/shop/etude-house-essence-mask-sheet-hyaluronic-acid/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Etude House’s Hyaluronic Acid Essence Mask</A> is a great way to lock in moisture overnight.</P><H2 class=""intertitre"">Natural Ingredients Make An Impact</H2><P class=""standard"">The most powerful ingredients on earth come straight from nature. If you wouldn't put chemicals and preservatives in your body, then why would you put them on your face? Look for beauty products with natural ingredients. A few favorites of our Korean beauty experts include Snail Mucin, green tea, and Yeast Ferment.</P><P class=""standard""><STRONG>Snail ​Mucin</STRONG>, also known as Snail Slime Extract (yes, from real slime) is becoming more popular in the beauty hemisphere. Koreans use <A href=""http://www.misshaus.com/ctrl.php?page=mainProductDetail&amp;p_code=MSMS2386&amp;ctg=BCA"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">snail creams</A> with this ingredient for people with sensitive skin. It is known to help regenerate skin cells, bringing back a healthy looking complexion. Would you put snail slime on your face for the sake of your skin cells?<STRONG>Green Tea </STRONG>helps revitalize tired skin and maintain a healthy, natural glow. Being one of the most popular ingredients in Asian beauty products today, it can be found it a wide variety of products from moisturizers to essences and everything in between.<STRONG>Yeast Ferment </STRONG>​is a naturally fortified Vitamin B group. Products with this ingredient, including <A href=""http://www.misshaus.com/ctrl.php?page=mainProductDetail&amp;p_code=MSMS2261&amp;ctg=BBA"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">essences</A>, help increase your metabolism and maintain healthy skin. &quot;This ingredient became popular in recent years for its anti-aging benefits,&quot; says Yuna. It is also great for cleansing and moisturizing the skin. Unfortunately, it does have a yeast-like smell, but when the benefits are so good you soon won't notice it!</P><H2 class=""intertitre"">Wear SPF To Protect Your Skin</H2><P class=""standard"">Many Korean women NEVER leave the house if they don't have sunblock. Now, we are not suggesting you develop Agoraphobia, but we're just advising you to always protect your skin whenever you're outdoors. No matter what season it is or what <mark>climate</mark> you live in, you should always apply sunblock.Missha's <A href=""http://www.misshaus.com/ctrl.php?page=mainProductDetail&amp;p_code=MSMS2383&amp;ctg=BFA"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mild Essence Sun Milk</A> protects, moisturizes, and hydrates your skin, providing a complete skin remedy each time it is applied. &quot;It's light, not sticky, moisturizing and doesn't leave a white cast&quot; says Charlotte. Wearing SPF also prevents aging, wrinkles, and harmful blemishes so get stocked up on you sunblock Korean style.</P><P class=""standard"">Remember to always go for broad spectrum SPF protection to filter UVA and UVB rays, both of which are damaging <EM>and</EM> aging. ​</P><H2 class=""intertitre"">Eat and drink clean</H2><P class=""standard"">Everything you put into your body affects your skin. If you want natural, clean, illuminating skin, then you must eat and drink clean! Nutrients in fruits and vegetables will help clear up your skin when imperfections arrive. The Korean diet is known for an abundance of water, vegetables, and other ingredients filled with minerals and nutrients that are sure to leave your skin gleaming.<STRONG>Kimchi</STRONG>is a fermented cabbage that Koreans eat with almost EVERY meal. This vegetable is loaded with probiotics, vitamin C and beta-carotene, ingredients that boost skin health.Many Korean families keep a pitcher of chilled <STRONG>boricha</STRONG> in their fridge, which is roasted barley tea. Not only does this tea keep your skin hydrated, but the drink is full of antioxidants and fiber, which help cleanse toxins out of your body allowing your skin to preserve it's elasticity.Another common ingredient in the Korean diet is a fermented rice wine called <STRONG>Makgeolli</STRONG>.

We focus on different forms of identity, cultural difference and expression in order to understand what makes a fair society and how to build one. By exploring representations of a complex, contested or unsettled history, we aim to learn from past traumas in Europe and beyond and promote a better understanding and communication across cultures, communities and languages.</P><P>Culture, in its broadest sense, is the transmission of languages, values, beliefs, histories and narratives. It makes the human world a richer and more diverse place in which to live but it also has the power to create divisions, conflict and war. Self-reflection, the study of dystopia rather than utopia and a critical scrutiny of our past and core beliefs are therefore essential to develop a democratic community and live together better.</P><P>The Politics of Culture and Memory cluster brings together expertise across disciplines and languages and seeks to bring knowledge to public use. Through a multitude of projects and international collaborations such as <A target=""_self"" href=""http://www.unrest.eu/""><STRONG>UNREST</STRONG></A> or <A target=""_self"" href=""https://co-creation-network.org/""><STRONG>CO-CREATION</STRONG></A>, we create opportunities for knowledge exchange with partners beyond academia including museums, charities, NGOs and communities locally and internationally. Out sustained impact has been showcased in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework in the form of case studies and is expected to feed into public policies in different areas such as memory policy and urban policy.</P><P>We are a hub seeking to nurture future generations of researchers and offer PhD supervision in areas including:</P><UL><LI>memory policy</LI><LI>emerging new identities and cultural mediations of societal change</LI><LI>gender and sexuality, their representation, actors and impact</LI></UL><P> </P><DIV id=""tabs""><DIV id=""research""><H3>Research strands</H3><P><STRONG>Museum Studies</STRONG>
As storehouses of knowledge and transmitters of history, museums play a vital role in mediating memory. The way they present their narratives and visitors’ responses to these displays can tell us much about how a given society perceives its participation in historical events.

As storehouses of knowledge and transmitters of history, museums play a vital role in mediating memory. The way they present their narratives and visitors’ responses to these displays can tell us much about how a given society perceives its participation in historical events. Researchers in the cluster work on how difficult history has been represented in the museum space with a view to collaborating with museum professionals to reflect on how to tell these stories in the future.</P><P><STRONG>Memory and conflict </STRONG>
An important strand of research focuses on dark heritage and addresses issues related to both the memory of conflict and conflicts of memory. Cluster members have engaged with novel theoretical approaches as well as with specific case studies, exploring the changing nature of commemoration and remembering, constructions of victimhood and perpetratorship, and the politics and policies of memory. Particular attention has been placed on individual and collective socio-political agency.</P><P><STRONG>Digital Humanities </STRONG>
The cluster cultivates a two-way relationship between cultural heritage and digital culture. We have a keen interest in exploring how digital tools and methods can be employed in the pursuit of humanities and social sciences and how these new technologies impact cultural heritage. We support and coordinate research in different settings throughout the university and Bath, with working relationships across the UK and beyond. Our research involves collaborative, trans-disciplinary and computationally engaged practices. We are particularly interested in how to make cultural heritage accessible in a meaningful and engaging way. Current projects include digitalization of artifacts, design and installation of Augmented and Virtual Reality experiences in museums, Ubiquitous and Pervasive Systems for indoor and outdoor heritage, gaming and participatory practices.<STRONG>Cultural diplomacy </STRONG>
Researchers in the cluster investigate the role of cultural diplomacy as a tool of soft power, but also as a mechanism by which nation states and other actors seek to define their identity in the world and promote international understanding. Investigating the intersection between cultural policy and practice, PoLIS researchers also seek to provide a theoretical understanding of the effects of cultural diplomacy in its real-world applications. In 2012, researchers in the cluster received funding from the AHRC for the project Developing a New Framework for Understanding the Role of Cultural Products in Cultural Diplomacy (further details here).<STRONG>Urban and rural Memory</STRONG>
Another strand of our research addresses conflicting memorial practices within local communities, urban or rural. We explore new identities that arise in multicultural urban cities on the outskirts of Greater Paris or in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Understanding the legacy of colonisation, slavery and decolonisation is key to understand present day conflicts and move towards more inclusive societies and <mark>sustainable</mark> urban communities. At the same time, urban memory is closely linked to the memory of rural communities because many of the migration processes are recent. We are also interested in the dialogue between urban and rural memories, between generations of migrants and their rural communities of origin, which favours intergenerational and inter-territorial integration and recognition.<STRONG>Transnational identities </STRONG>
The borders of states are permeable, despite the construction of walls or physical isolation by the sea. Our research focuses on transnational identities forged through migration processes and in armed conflicts such as wars. Transnational identities have an individual component, but above all they are collective, the fruit of exchanges, collaborations and common experiences. Our research addresses the construction of these transnational identities in the context of globalization in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and ‘re-nationalisation’ of politics marked by the current rise of isolationist and nationalist movements in Europe.</P><P>Researchers in the cluster work on how difficult history has been represented in the museum space with a view to collaborating with museum professionals to reflect on how to tell these stories in the future.</P></DIV><DIV id=""networks""><H3>Research networks</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
